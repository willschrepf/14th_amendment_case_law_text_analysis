Twenty years after prison\n\ninmate Michelle Kosilek first requested treatment for her severe\n\ngender identity disorder, the district court issued an order\n\nrequiring the defendant, Luis S. Spencer, Commissioner of the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Correction (the \"DOC\"),1 to provide\n\nKosilek with sex reassignment surgery.      The court found that the\n\nDOC's failure to provide the surgery — which was said by a group of\n\nqualified doctors to be medically necessary to treat Kosilek's\n\ncondition — violated Kosilek's Eighth Amendment rights.        The DOC\n\nappeals the district court's order.      Having carefully considered\n\nthe relevant law and the extensive factual record, we affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n    A. Gender Identity Disorder and Sex Reassignment Surgery\n\n          The   concepts   of   gender   identity   disorder   and   sex\n\nreassignment surgery sit center stage in this case and feature\n\nprominently in this opinion.    Therefore, before we go any further,\n\nwe provide a little context.     As this court has explained, gender\n\nidentity disorder is \"a psychological condition involving a strong\n\nidentification with the other gender.\"       Battista v. Clarke, 645\n\nF.3d 449, 450 (1st Cir. 2011).    It is a disorder recognized by the\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, which describes gender identity\n\n     1\n       For ease of reference we will speak of the defendant as the\nDOC, since the DOC's commissioner has changed multiple times during\nthe life span of Kosilek's lawsuits.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdisorder as having two components.           American Psychiatric Ass'n,\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth\n\nEdition - Text Revision 576 (2000) (\"DSM-IV-TR\").2          The first is\n\n\"evidence of a strong and persistent cross-gender identification,\n\nwhich is the desire to be, or the insistence that one is, of the\n\nother sex.\"    Id.   The second is \"evidence of persistent discomfort\n\nabout one's assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the\n\ngender role of that sex.\"        Id.\n\n             This current diagnosis of gender identity disorder grew\n\nout of an earlier diagnosis of transsexualism, which first appeared\n\nas an official disorder in the third edition of the DSM, published\n\nin 1980. Judith S. Stern & Claire V. Merkine, Brian L. v. Admin.\n\nfor   Children's     Services:    Ambivalence   Toward   Gender   Identity\n\nDisorder as a Medical Condition, 30 Women's Rts. L. Rep. 566, 567-\n\n68 (2009).    In the 1950s and 1960s, research began to show that a\n\n\"combination of psychotherapy, hormone treatment, and surgical\n\nreconfiguration of the genitalia\" could be used to treat gender\n\nidentity disorder.     Id. at 571.      This idea gained traction in the\n\n1960s and 1970s, id., and as we will discuss more fully below, this\n\n\n      2\n       DSM-IV-TR, the version applicable in Kosilek's cases, uses\nthe term gender identity disorder. A newer edition, DSM-5, was\nreleased in May 2013.    DSM-5 replaces the term gender identity\ndisorder with gender dysphoria to avoid any negative stigma. See\nAmerican      Psychiatric       Ass'n,     Gender      Dysphoria,\nhttp://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Gender%20Dysphoria%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\n(last visited Jan. 16, 2014). Because the term gender identity\ndisorder was used throughout Kosilek's cases and was the then-\nappropriate nomenclature, we will use that term.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f triadic approach is still utilized by many practitioners today.\n\nSex reassignment surgery in particular has been performed in North\n\nAmerica since at least the 1950s, and it has been estimated that as\n\nof January 2006, 30,000 sex reassignment surgeries have been\n\nperformed in the United States.    Id. at 571-72.\n\n          With this bigger picture in place, we move on to the\n\nfacts of this case.    We again note that this case has an over\n\ntwenty-year history. This has included two trials and two lengthy,\n\nfact-intensive decisions issued by the district court, the latter\n\nof which is the subject matter of this appeal.      Because of this,\n\nand because the district court's opinion was so fact-intensive, it\n\nis necessary for us to lay out a good deal of background.\n\n                      B. Kosilek's Conviction\n\n          Michelle Kosilek, née Robert, who is sixty-four years\n\nold, was born and still is anatomically male. Kosilek suffers from\n\ngender identity disorder. This has resulted in Kosilek's long-held\n\nbelief that she3 is a woman cruelly trapped in a man's body.\n\n          Kosilek, who spent some of her childhood in an orphanage,\n\nsuffered regular abuse as a child, in part because of her expressed\n\ndesire to live as a girl.     As she grew older, she alternated\n\nbetween living as a man and a woman.    Kosilek's teenage and early\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       We will refer to Kosilek as her preferred gender of female,\nusing feminine pronouns.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fadult years were marred by arrests, incarcerations, beatings, heavy\n\ndrinking, drug use, and a stint as a prostitute.\n\n          Sometime in the 1980s, Kosilek married Cheryl McCaul, a\n\nvolunteer counselor at a drug rehabilitation facility, who Kosilek\n\nmet while being treated there.          McCaul thought she could cure\n\nKosilek's gender identity disorder, but Kosilek's desire to be\n\nfemale did not go away. In 1990, Kosilek murdered McCaul. Kosilek\n\nfled the area but was ultimately apprehended in New York.\n\n          Kosilek awaited trial at the Bristol County Jail.     While\n\nthere, Kosilek, who had taken female hormones many years earlier,\n\nstarted taking female hormones (in the form of birth control pills)\n\nthat she illicitly obtained from a guard.        She also, at her own\n\nexpense, consulted with a gender identity disorder specialist,\n\nthough she was not allowed to undergo any treatment.            While\n\nawaiting trial, Kosilek twice tried to kill herself; one attempt\n\nwas made while she was taking the antidepressant Prozac.      Kosilek\n\nalso attempted self-castration.\n\n          Kosilek was eventually tried and, in 1992, was convicted\n\nof McCaul's murder and sentenced to life in prison without the\n\npossibility of parole.   She was turned over to the DOC and since\n\n1994 has been residing in the general population at MCI-Norfolk, a\n\nmedium security male prison.   There Kosilek started living, to the\n\nextent possible, as a woman, legally changing her name from Robert\n\nto Michelle.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f                            C. Kosilek's Lawsuits\n\n               In 1992, Kosilek filed a pro se complaint against the DOC\n\nin   the      United   States   District   Court    for   the   District   of\n\nMassachusetts.4        See Kosilek v. Maloney, 221 F. Supp. 2d 156 (D.\n\nMass. 2002) (\"Kosilek I\"). Kosilek alleged the DOC was denying her\n\nadequate medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nKosilek sought damages and an injunction ordering that she be\n\nprovided with sex reassignment surgery.            The case was assigned to\n\nJudge Mark L. Wolf, and proceeded for some years with the parties\n\nengaging in discovery and motion practice.\n\n               Meanwhile, in December 2000, having not yet received the\n\nrelief she was seeking, Kosilek filed this case — a second pro se\n\nlawsuit against the DOC and some of its medical providers.                 See\n\nKosilek v. Spencer, 889 F. Supp. 2d 190 (D. Mass. 2012) (\"Kosilek\n\nII\").       Again the gravamen of Kosilek's complaint was that the DOC\n\nwas denying her adequate medical care in violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment by not providing her with sex reassignment surgery. This\n\ncase also went to Judge Wolf.\n\n               In February 2002, Kosilek's first lawsuit, Kosilek I,\n\nfinally proceeded to a non-jury trial.               Due to some pretrial\n\nskirmishing, only Kosilek's claim for injunctive relief remained\n\n(her damages claim was gone).        The trial lasted a couple of weeks.\n\n\n        4\n      Kosilek initially sued the Bristol County Sheriff, but later\namended the complaint to include the DOC after she was transferred\nto its custody.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                    D. The Kosilek I Decision\n\n          On August 28, 2002, Judge Wolf issued his decision.   See\n\nKosilek I, 221 F. Supp. 2d at 156.    The court explained that to\n\nmake out an Eighth Amendment violation, both an objective and a\n\nsubjective component must be satisfied.   In short, the objective\n\ncomponent requires that the inmate has a serious medical need that\n\nhas not been adequately treated.     The subjective piece, on the\n\nother hand, focuses on the state of mind of the prison officials\n\nand requires that they were aware the inmate was at risk for\n\nserious harm.5\n\n          The court found that Kosilek suffered from a severe form\n\nof gender identity disorder that caused her great mental anguish.\n\nIt went on to hold that this disorder was a serious medical need\n\nwithin the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.   To address the issue\n\nof what types of treatment might be warranted, the court looked to\n\nthe Harry Benjamin Standards of Care (the \"Standards of Care\"),6\n\nwhich it found to be the accepted protocols used by professionals\n\n\n     5\n       We will go into much greater depth regarding the Eighth\nAmendment standard in our own analysis, but for now it suffices to\nintroduce the concept of the two-pronged test.\n     6\n       The operative version of the Standards of Care for both\nKosilek I and Kosilek II is the Sixth Version, issued in February\n2001. See Harry Benjamin Int'l Gender Dysphoria Ass'n, Standards\nof Care for Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version (2001). The\nSeventh Version came out in 2011 under a new name.           World\nProfessional Association for Transgender Health, Standards of Care\nfor the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-\nNonconforming People, Version 7 (2011) (the \"Standards of Care,\nVersion 7\").\n\n                               -8-\n\fin the United States to treat gender identity disorder.             The\n\nStandards of Care indicated that, depending on the severity of an\n\nindividual's gender identity disorder, psychotherapy alone or\n\npsychotherapy along with the administration of female hormones\n\ncould   constitute   sufficient   treatment.     In   other   instances,\n\nhowever, sex reassignment surgery was medically necessary.          The\n\ncourt found that, despite DOC doctors recommending that Kosilek\n\nreceive female hormones and possibly surgery, the DOC, which at the\n\ntime was headed up by Commissioner Michael Maloney, had not\n\nprovided Kosilek with any of the treatment prescribed by the\n\nStandards of Care.\n\n           The court chronicled the steps taken by Maloney to avoid\n\nproviding Kosilek with treatment.       First, when an expert hired by\n\nthe DOC, Marshall Forstein, M.D., recommended psychotherapy and\n\nhormones for Kosilek, and also, that she be allowed to consult with\n\na surgeon who specialized in sex reassignment surgery, the DOC\n\nterminated its relationship with Dr. Forstein.        Maloney then made\n\nit clear to DOC doctors that he did not want to provide Kosilek or\n\nany transgender prisoner with hormones or surgery, and the DOC\n\nproceeded to find a Canadian doctor, Robert Dickey, M.D., who\n\nbelieved inmates should never be considered for sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.   Dr. Dickey advocated a \"freeze-frame\" policy whereby\n\ntransgender individuals would be frozen in the frame in which they\n\nentered prison.      For instance, only persons receiving hormones\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fbefore they were in prison would get hormones in prison.         Despite\n\nMaloney having little familiarity with the rationale behind Dr.\n\nDickey's philosophy on the treatment of gender identity disorder,\n\nand not having read the Standards of Care, Maloney adopted Dr.\n\nDickey's freeze-frame policy for the DOC.\n\n          Dr. Dickey testified at trial, but the court did not find\n\nhim persuasive because he did not subscribe to the Standards of\n\nCare, which the court found that prudent professionals follow, and\n\nhis approach did not allow for individual assessment.          The court\n\nfound Kosilek's experts credible and relied on their testimony to\n\nfind that the objective component of the Eighth Amendment had been\n\nsatisfied, namely that Kosilek had a serious medical need that had\n\nnot been adequately treated.\n\n          But   the   court   found   Kosilek   had   fallen   short   of\n\nestablishing an Eighth Amendment violation because the subjective\n\ncomponent of deliberate indifference had not been satisfied.\n\nMaloney, the court concluded, knew many facts from which he could\n\nhave inferred Kosilek would suffer serious harm if her gender\n\nidentity disorder was not treated, but he did not actually draw\n\nthat required inference.       Instead Judge Wolf found Maloney's\n\nrefusal to allow Kosilek treatment was \"rooted in sincere security\n\nconcerns, and in a fear of public and political criticism as well.\"\n\nThe end result: because there was no Eighth Amendment violation,\n\nthe court did not order the DOC to do anything.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f           Nonetheless, Judge Wolf expected it would do something.\n\nHe wrote: \"This court's decision puts Maloney on notice that\n\nKosilek has a serious medical need which is not being properly\n\ntreated.   Therefore, he has a duty to respond reasonably to it.\n\nThe court expects that he will.\"\n\n                 E. The After-Effects of Kosilek I\n\n           Following the court's dictate, lots of activity ensued at\n\nthe DOC.   First, the DOC lifted its freeze-frame policy around\n\nDecember 2002.     In its place went a policy allowing inmates\n\nsuffering from gender identity disorder to receive a level of\n\ntreatment commensurate with that which they were receiving upon\n\nentering prison (including receipt of hormones), but also providing\n\nfor increased or decreased treatment if it was determined to be\n\nmedically indicated by the University of Massachusetts Correctional\n\nHealth Program (\"UMass\"), the entity under contract with the DOC to\n\nprovide medical (including mental health) services to all inmates.\n\nPrior to the implementation of any progressive or regressive\n\ntreatment changes, the DOC's Director of Health Services and the\n\nCommissioner were required to consider whether the changes would\n\nresult in any safety or security concerns.\n\n           A couple of months later, in February 2003, the DOC\n\nbrought in a gender identity specialist, David Seil, M.D., to\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fevaluate Kosilek.7       Dr. Seil interviewed Kosilek and reviewed her\n\nmedical records, and then conveyed his findings and recommendation\n\nin writing.       Per DOC policy, which required any recommendations\n\ninvolving gender identity disorder to go to both UMass's Medical\n\nDirector and its Mental Health Program Director, the report went to\n\nKenneth Appelbaum, M.D., who held the latter position.\n\n            Dr. Seil wrote the following.           Like Drs. Forstein and\n\nDickey before him, he diagnosed Kosilek with gender identity\n\ndisorder.        He found Kosilek's \"gender dysphoria8 intense,\" and\n\nthough Kosilek had done what she could to obtain relief by living\n\nas a woman, her basic disorder had been left untreated during her\n\nincarceration. Dr. Seil, who noted that Kosilek had been living as\n\na   woman   in    a   male   prison   without   security   issues   thus   far,\n\nindicated that the Standards of Care \"need[ed] to be observed.\" He\n\nfurther found that Kosilek was not currently suicidal because she\n\nthen felt some power over her pursuit of becoming a woman.\n\n\n\n      7\n       UMass's policy was to utilize consultants in matters that\nwent beyond the expertise of its direct staff.\n      8\n       Dr. Seil, and various other medical providers involved in\nthis case, sometimes use the term gender dysphoria. As indicated\npreviously, the American Psychiatric Association now uses this term\nin place of gender identity disorder. The current version of the\nStandards of Care says gender dysphoria is \"broadly defined as\ndiscomfort or distress that is caused by a discrepancy between a\nperson's gender identity and that person's sex assigned at birth.\"\nStandards of Care, Version 7, at 2. It is not certain whether the\nmedical providers in this case were all using the term gender\ndysphoria to mean precisely the same thing but, at a minimum, it\nappears they were all using it similarly.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            Dr. Seil made several recommendations.            First, Kosilek\n\nshould     be     provided     with   estrogen     therapy,     electrolysis\n\n(specifically,      permanent    facial   hair   removal),    and   access   to\n\ngender-appropriate personal items, such as female clothing and\n\nmake-up.        Additionally, Kosilek should be allowed to see the\n\ntherapist she had been treating with, master's-level psychologist\n\nMark Burrowes, more often than once a month.           Further, feminizing\n\nprocedures, such as rhinoplasty (plastic surgery performed on the\n\nnose) or breast augmentation, should be considered in the future.\n\nFinally, Dr. Seil noted that sex reassignment surgery was the last\n\nstep in treating gender identity disorder.           He explained that, as\n\nprovided in the Standards of Care, an evaluation of the necessity\n\nof the surgery must wait until after a patient has lived as a woman\n\nfor at least a year.9        While Kosilek had been living as a woman for\n\nmany years, she had not had the benefit of hormone therapy and\n\nelectrolysis.      Therefore Dr. Seil recommended that after Kosilek\n\nhad a year of hormone treatment under her belt, an experienced\n\ngender identity specialist should evaluate her to determine whether\n\nsurgery was needed.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Dr. Seil was referring to the fact that the Standards of\nCare require that prior to receiving sex reassignment surgery, a\nperson must live full-time for one year in the preferred gender\nrole.    This requirement is commonly called the real-life\nexperience, and it is something we will discuss in more detail\nlater.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f           The DOC began implementing Dr. Seil's recommendations.\n\nIn April 2003, Kosilek started treating with an endocrinologist to\n\ndevelop a hormone therapy treatment plan.         Concomitantly, per DOC\n\npolicy, the security implications of Kosilek receiving hormones\n\nwere assessed.      On July 29, 2003, Luis Spencer, now the DOC\n\nCommissioner but then the Superintendent of MCI-Norfolk, reported\n\nto then DOC Commissioner Maloney that he did not believe there were\n\nany current security concerns with Kosilek being provided estrogen\n\ntherapy,   but   once   Kosilek   began   to   exhibit   physical   changes\n\nsecurity concerns might have to be reevaluated.\n\n           And so on August 26, 2003, Kosilek began female hormone\n\ntreatment.     Then, starting in October 2003, Kosilek was provided\n\nwith certain gender-appropriate items, such as female undergarments\n\nand make-up.     As neither Dr. Seil nor the endocrinologist Kosilek\n\nwas treating with had made specific recommendations as to whether\n\nfeminizing procedures were needed, none were provided. The DOC did\n\nfind a facility willing to provide Kosilek with electrolysis and,\n\nafter a security review of the facility was conducted, electrolysis\n\ntreatments were scheduled for November the following year.\n\n           In December 2003, Kathleen Dennehy, who had been the\n\nDOC's   Deputy    Commissioner    under    Maloney,      was   elevated   to\n\nCommissioner.     Right away she informed the staff she wanted to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f\"regroup on this GID stuff.\"10         And she wanted Kosilek reevaluated\n\nbefore approving \"laser hair removal or anything else.\"11\n\n               As of September 2004, Kosilek had been on hormones for a\n\nyear    and,    pursuant   to   the   Standards   of   Care   and   Dr.   Seil's\n\nrecommendation, was eligible to be evaluated for sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.       The issue of conducting evaluations for prisoners with\n\ngender identity disorder was taken up at executive staff meetings,\n\nattended by UMass and DOC personnel, around this time.                    Those\n\ntypically in attendance from the DOC included Susan Martin, the\n\nDOC's Director of Health Services, and Gregory Hughes, the DOC's\n\nDirector of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, as well as\n\na couple other DOC officials.           Representing UMass was its Mental\n\nHealth Program Director Dr. Appelbaum, along with some additional\n\nUMass personnel.\n\n               At one meeting, Dr. Appelbaum spoke about retaining the\n\nFenway Community Health Center (the \"Fenway Center\"), a Boston\n\nhealthcare facility focused on serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual,\n\nand transgender community. Hughes, however, had some reservations;\n\nhe felt the Fenway Center might be too sympathetic to the prisoners\n\nand too quick to recommend treatment.             Dr. Appelbaum countered,\n\nstating the Fenway Center's approach represented the norm rather\n\n\n\n       10\n            \"GID\" is an acronym for gender identity disorder.\n       11\n       It is unclear from the record what happened, if anything,\nbased on Dennehy's desires to regroup and reevaluate.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthan the exception and there really were not many other providers\n\nin the area with whom to consult.      Hughes said he had spoken with\n\na Johns Hopkins gender identity specialist, Cynthia Osborne, a\n\nlicensed social worker, who was working with the Virginia and\n\nWisconsin departments of corrections, which had also been sued by\n\ntransgender prisoners.   It was noted on the meeting minutes that\n\nOsborne \"may do more objective evaluations,\" and was \"[m]ore\n\nsympathetic to DOC position.\"\n\n          Despite Hughes's qualms about the Fenway Center and the\n\npossible option of using Osborne, the DOC went ahead with retaining\n\nthe Fenway Center.   Kosilek was evaluated by Kevin Kapila, M.D.,\n\nand Randi Kaufman, Psy.D., who conducted a ninety-minute interview\n\nwith her and reviewed her medical records.        The doctors issued\n\ntheir report with several findings on February 24, 2005 (the\n\n\"Fenway Report\").    As had been documented in the past, Kosilek\n\n\"clearly fit[]\" the diagnosis for gender identity disorder.\n\nKosilek had been on hormone therapy and living full-time as a woman\n\nfor seventeen months by that time.     Kosilek's ability to live as a\n\nwoman, her good behavior, and her absence of conflict with others,\n\nsuggested, according to the doctors, an \"intense motivation, as\n\nwell as a real adaptability to her environment.\"      They noted her\n\nfavorable response to the use of hormones, electrolysis, and use of\n\nfeminine products.    But, they noted, Kosilek was still \"quite\n\ndistressed,\" and given Kosilek's \"previous suicide attempts, her\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fongoing distress, and lack of other goals in her life,\" the doctors\n\nfound it was quite likely Kosilek would attempt suicide again if\n\nshe was not provided with sex reassignment surgery.        Kosilek had a\n\nserious medical need, they felt, and there was a substantial risk\n\nof harm if her disorder was left untreated.\n\n            The report went on to note that Kosilek had moved\n\nsuccessfully through the steps outlined in the Standards of Care,\n\nthere had not been any adverse reactions to Kosilek's feminized\n\nappearance, and Kosilek had benefitted psychologically from her\n\nchanges.    Drs. Kapila and Kaufman concluded Kosilek was likely\n\nready for sex reassignment surgery.            The surgery, the doctors\n\nopined, would provide Kosilek with full relief from the symptoms of\n\ngender    identity   disorder   and   likely   increase   her   chance   of\n\nsurvival.   The ultimate recommendation of the specialists retained\n\nby the DOC as advised by its own doctors: Kosilek should be given\n\nthe surgery.\n\n            Unhappy with the Fenway Report, the DOC turned to the\n\nJohns Hopkins gender identity specialist, Cynthia Osborne, whose\n\nname had been batted around at the earlier DOC meeting.           The DOC\n\nasked Osborne to conduct a peer review12 of the Fenway Report and\n\n\n\n\n     12\n       Peer review is the term used by the DOC — we presume because\nsocial worker Osborne was tasked primarily with reviewing the\nrecommendation of her so-called peers, the Fenway Center doctors,\nas opposed to interviewing Kosilek and conducting an independent\nassessment.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fshe agreed.   The report, along with other evaluations conducted of\n\nKosilek, were sent to Osborne on April 12, 2005.\n\n          In the meantime, on April 15, 2005, Dr. Appelbaum, who at\n\nthe time was a defendant in this lawsuit along with UMass and some\n\nother doctors, filed (at the district court's request) a status\n\nreport.   It advised the court of Drs. Kapila and Kaufman's sex\n\nreassignment surgery recommendation for Kosilek.          Dr. Appelbaum\n\nalso said he had advised the DOC of the doctors' recommendation and\n\nhad informed them he was unaware of any medical reason why Kosilek\n\nshould not receive the surgery.\n\n          The   court    responded   with   an   April   25,   2005   order\n\ndirecting the DOC to provide a report addressing potential security\n\nconcerns should Kosilek undergo the surgery.       It also directed the\n\nDOC to indicate whether it was going to provide Kosilek with the\n\nsurgery recommended by the Fenway Center doctors.\n\n          A few days later, on April 28, 2005, the DOC responded to\n\nthe UMass status report.      The letter was penned by Susan Martin\n\n(recall she was the DOC Director of Health Services) and sent to\n\nDr. Appelbaum and UMass's Medical Director, Arthur Brewer, M.D.\n\n(also a defendant).     Dennehy and other DOC officials were copied.\n\nMartin maligned Dr. Appelbaum's status report, asserting that the\n\nDOC did not consider it an adequate review of the Fenway Report or\n\na clear explanation of UMass's recommendation.           Martin requested\n\nthat the UMass doctors make clear whether they thought Kosilek\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fshould       be    operated   on.    She    also    wanted   answers   to   various\n\nquestions relating to, among other things, the surgery's logistics,\n\nsuch as who would perform it, the recovery process, and the success\n\nrate.\n\n                  Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer, in a May 10, 2005 response\n\nletter to the DOC, clarified their stance on the Fenway Report. As\n\nthey explained, UMass deferred to the Fenway Center and stood\n\nbehind the doctors' sex reassignment surgery recommendation for\n\nKosilek.          They were aware of no mental health barriers to Kosilek\n\nbeing operated on and the next step was finding a surgeon.                      It\n\nappeared there were no physicians in Massachusetts who could\n\nperform       the    surgery,   so   some    out-of-state    practitioners     were\n\nsuggested.          The doctors also offered to look into the logistics of\n\nproviding the surgery.\n\n                  In the interim, Osborne completed her review of the\n\nFenway Report.13         She chronicled her findings in a report dated May\n\n20, 2005, which she sent to the DOC.               It began with the caveat that\n\nOsborne had not conducted a clinical evaluation of Kosilek and her\n\nreport was based solely on her review of the Fenway Report and some\n\nof the other evaluations of Kosilek.                  Though she did not doubt\n\n\n\n        13\n         We pause to say a little more about Osborne's\nqualifications. According to her C.V., at least as of 2006, she\nheld a master's degree in education and social work. Osborne was\nalso an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine and on the consulting faculty of the\nUniversity's Center for Sexual Health and Medicine.\n\n                                           -19-\n\fKosilek met the criteria for gender identity disorder, Osborne went\n\non to lodge numerous criticisms against Drs. Kapila and Kaufman's\n\napproach.\n\n            First, Osborne disparaged the Fenway Report for not\n\naddressing the issue of whether Kosilek was suffering from any\n\npersonality disorders.         She opined that \"[c]larity regarding the\n\npresence,   absence,     nature    and    severity\"      of    any      personality\n\ndisorder,   especially    given    that     clinicians    had      at    one   point\n\ndiagnosed   Kosilek     with    antisocial     personality         disorder,    was\n\ncritical because its presence could complicate a gender identity\n\ndisorder diagnosis.      Osborne also argued that threats of suicide\n\nand self-harm signal serious mental illness apart from gender\n\nidentity disorder, which demands treatment and, in fact, counsels\n\nagainst providing sex reassignment surgery. She thought the Fenway\n\nReport had given short shrift to this issue.\n\n            Osborne then turned her focus to the Standards of Care,\n\nexpressing her concerns that they did not translate well into a\n\nprison environment.     She wrote: \"In my view, providing surgery, or\n\neven   hormones,   to   incarcerated      individuals,        is   an   undeniable\n\nlowering of the Standards, and an explicit violation of the\n\ncriteria regarding sociopathy and suicidality.\"                    While Osborne\n\nrecognized the Standards of Care as helpful, she noted they had no\n\nregulatory authority.      Also, there was no universal consensus in\n\nthe psychiatric community about what constituted medical necessity\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fin the treatment of gender identity disorder.         She criticized the\n\nFenway Report for failing to address other possible treatment\n\noptions for Kosilek or to provide an adequate explanation for its\n\nsurgery   recommendation.       Kosilek,   in   Osborne's    eyes,   had   an\n\nunrealistic expectation that she was owed certain treatments and\n\nKosilek would instead benefit from a thorough assessment for\n\npsychiatric disorders and treatment designed to address any such\n\ndisorders along with her gender identity disorder.\n\n              On May 25, 2005, the back and forth between the DOC and\n\nUMass continued.        Martin sent Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer another\n\ncriticism-laced letter. While the doctors had answered some of the\n\nDOC's questions, they had not provided a comprehensive review of\n\nthe appropriateness or necessity of surgery for Kosilek.             Citing\n\nthe   DOC's    Eighth   Amendment   obligations,   Martin    lamented   that\n\nneither UMass nor the Fenway Report had offered guidance on whether\n\nsurgery was \"a medical necessity for Kosilek.\"              Finally, Martin\n\ninformed them of the DOC's engagement of Osborne to review the\n\nFenway Report and enclosed a copy of Osborne's report.               Martin\n\nasked UMass to review the report and give the DOC its ultimate\n\nrecommendation as to the appropriateness of surgery for Kosilek.\n\n              The same day Martin fired off her letter, a news piece,\n\nwhich was highly negative toward Kosilek and her quest for surgery,\n\nappeared on a local television station.         Commissioner Dennehy had\n\nbeen interviewed for the piece on May 16, and one of her comments\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fmade it on air.14     A Massachusetts state senator, who had filed\n\nlegislation seeking to prohibit the state from paying for sex\n\nreassignment surgery for inmates, also spoke to the reporter.\n\n\"When you go to prison you lose some rights.         You also lose your\n\nrights to get a sex change operation,\" he stated. The senator, who\n\nwas an acquaintance of Dennehy, had called Dennehy on her cell\n\nphone to advise her that he would be participating in the news\n\npiece.    The piece concluded with the reporter indicating: \"Later\n\nthis week, the state will tell the federal court that sex surgery\n\nfor Michelle Kosilek would result in a security nightmare.\"15\n\n           Despite the security concerns the DOC expressed to the\n\nmedia, Dennehy and her staff had yet (as of the time she was\n\ninterviewed)   to   officially   convene   to   conduct   their   internal\n\nsecurity review. Not until May 19, three days after her interview,\n\ndid they actually meet.    In attendance were Dennehy, DOC counsel,\n\nSuperintendent Spencer of MCI-Norfolk, and Superintendent Lynne\n\nBissonnette of MCI-Framingham, the women's prison where Kosilek\n\nmight be sent were she to undergo surgery.         Dennehy did not have\n\nthe benefit of written reports from Spencer or Bissonnette, despite\n\n\n\n     14\n       She was quoted: \"The courts are telling us that medical\nprofessionals make medical recommendations and correctional\nadministrators assess the safety and security concerns.\"\n     15\n       It seems likely that the reporter learned this information\nfrom Dennehy herself, though it is unclear whether it could have\ncome from someone on her staff.     Either way the DOC does not\ndispute that this tidbit came from within the DOC.\n\n                                  -22-\n\fDOC   policy   calling    for   the   superintendents    to   make   such\n\nrecommendations, because (as Dennehy later testified) the security\n\nconcerns seemed self-evident.\n\n          On June 10, 2005, the DOC brought the court back into the\n\nloop, finally filing the status report which the court had ordered\n\nback on April 25.    The DOC informed Judge Wolf it had decided not\n\nto provide Kosilek with sex reassignment surgery.         In support of\n\nits decision, the DOC attached Osborne's report.        It also attached\n\nthe court-ordered security report, which was principally authored\n\nby DOC attorneys with input from Dennehy.\n\n          The security report, which said it was based on Dennehy's\n\nthirty years of correctional knowledge and experience, as well as\n\nthe experience of colleagues she had spoken with, stated the\n\nfollowing.     Allowing the surgery to go forward \"would create\n\nsubstantial safety and security problems for DOC.\"            She claimed\n\nthat out-of-state surgery, which appeared to be the only option\n\nbased on a dearth of doctors in Massachusetts, would cause \"complex\n\nsecurity and logistical issues\" and might give Kosilek a chance to\n\nescape custody.     Kosilek's post-surgery confinement was also a\n\ncause for concern.       Dennehy argued Kosilek would be at risk for\n\nsexual assault if she were to remain in a male prison, and housing\n\nher in a female prison would come with its own host of problems.\n\nSpecifically, Dennehy anticipated \"serious climate issues\" since\n\nthe majority of the women at MCI-Framingham had histories of trauma\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fand it was well known that Kosilek had killed her wife.            The women\n\nmight pose a threat to Kosilek and vice versa.         Kosilek would need\n\nto be isolated and restrictively confined in either prison and\n\nthis, Dennehy concluded, might be deleterious to Kosilek's mental\n\nhealth. Citing these concerns, along with what she perceived as an\n\nunclear stance from UMass on whether surgery was necessary,16 and\n\ngiven Osborne's critiques of the Fenway Report, Dennehy indicated\n\nthat the DOC was denying Kosilek's request for surgery.\n\n           After the status report was filed with the court, the DOC\n\nand UMass continued to clash over what the DOC perceived to be\n\nUMass's equivocations.     Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer directed a June\n\n14, 2005 letter at the DOC.      Calling the DOC's statements in its\n\nprevious letters and status report \"disingenuous,\" the doctors\n\nemphasized that it was not within their purview to decide whether\n\nsurgery   is   medically   necessary   for   Kosilek   as   that    term   is\n\ncontemplated by the Eighth Amendment.        UMass, they explained, had\n\nconsistently relied on the expertise of outside consultants, all of\n\nwhom had said the same thing.      The doctors again underlined that\n\nsolely from a clinical perspective it appeared that Kosilek should\n\nbe offered surgery.\n\n\n\n     16\n       The report quoted the supposedly ambiguous language from\nUMass's letter: \"the treatment recommended in the Fenway\nreport . . . appears to be reasonable and appropriate, since the\npatient has met criteria for the diagnosis of gender identity\ndisorder and has reached a point in clinical treatment where sexual\nreassignment surgery, if desired, would be the next step.\"\n\n                                  -24-\n\f           On October 7, 2005, Drs. Kapila and Kaufman prepared and\n\nissued another report, this one a response to Osborne's critiques\n\nof their Fenway Report, which they sent to UMass and which UMass\n\npassed on to the DOC.      Citing medical literature and studies, the\n\ndoctors took aim at Osborne's criticisms, explaining why her\n\nchallenges to their recommendation for surgery were clinically\n\nunfounded or irrelevant.        The report also argued that Kosilek was\n\nstable, not currently suicidal, and a good candidate for surgery.\n\nThe doctors strenuously insisted that their recommendation of\n\nsurgery was an informed clinical judgment rooted in Kosilek's\n\ngender   identity    disorder    diagnosis,    her   marked   mental   health\n\nimprovement since being provided hormones and being allowed to live\n\nas a woman, and the well-documented effectiveness of surgery.            The\n\ndoctors reiterated their recommendation that Kosilek be provided\n\nwith the surgery.      Dr. Appelbaum submitted this report to the DOC\n\non October 17, 2005, restating UMass's endorsement of the original\n\nFenway Report's recommendations and requesting that the DOC issue\n\na decision approving those recommendations.\n\n           As to the status of Kosilek's lawsuit, as of July 2005,\n\nKosilek had let all the medical provider defendants (Drs. Appelbaum\n\nand Brewer, and UMass, among others) out of the case.             That same\n\nmonth she filed an amended complaint, this time with the benefit of\n\nan attorney, with Dennehy as the sole named defendant.           Kosilek no\n\nlonger   sought     damages,    she   only   requested   injunctive    relief\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\frequiring the DOC to provide her with adequate medical care,\n\nincluding sex reassignment surgery.           The case went to trial a\n\nlittle less than a year later.\n\n                         F. The Kosilek II Trial\n\n                        1. Round One of Testimony\n\n          The non-jury trial, which like Kosilek I was presided\n\nover by Judge Wolf (by then Chief Judge), began on May 30, 2006.\n\nTestimony initially went until the end of June, with multiple\n\nwitnesses testifying.17\n\n          First   the    court    heard    from   George   Brown,   M.D.,   a\n\npracticing psychiatrist who helped author the Standards of Care,\n\nand who testified as an expert on Kosilek's behalf (he also\n\ntestified in Kosilek I).      As he had done back in 2001, Dr. Brown\n\nevaluated Kosilek and reviewed her medical records.          He prepared a\n\nwritten report, and in it diagnosed Kosilek with chronic and severe\n\ngender identity disorder.        He did not think she met the criteria\n\nfor antisocial personality disorder.        Dr. Brown also did not think\n\nKosilek was trying to game the system, writing that he was \"hard\n\npressed to develop a rational explanation for why someone would\n\nwork so fervently to obtain this serious, painful surgery\" other\n\nthan as a means to treat gender identity disorder.          Dr. Brown also\n\nopined that Kosilek had met or exceeded the readiness criteria for\n\n\n     17\n       We summarize the testimony in the order it was given, save\nfor Dr. Schmidt. He actually testified before Kosilek finished\nputting on her witnesses (we assume for scheduling convenience).\n\n                                    -26-\n\fsex reassignment surgery.       Among other things, she had completed a\n\nmore than two-year monitored, real-life experience living as a\n\nwoman while incarcerated. Further, he wrote, Kosilek had \"received\n\nan unambiguous diagnosis of severe gender identity disorder from no\n\nfewer than nine mental health professionals who have interviewed\n\nher, many of whom are recognized international experts in the field\n\nof gender identity disorder.\"         Dr. Brown stressed, \"[n]o further\n\ntreatment or real-life experience is necessary,\" and Kosilek should\n\nreceive the surgery, which Dr. Brown deemed \"medically necessary.\"\n\n           Hammering the point home, Dr. Brown testified, consistent\n\nwith his written report, that the hormones and psychotherapy\n\nKosilek   was    receiving,     though   they   had    helped    relieve    her\n\ndysphoria, were \"[a]bsolutely not\" sufficient to eliminate the\n\nserious risk of harm Kosilek faced, up to and including suicide.\n\nWhen   asked    whether   sex    reassignment    surgery      was   medically\n\nnecessary, Dr. Brown stated: \"Absolutely.            If I can walk away from\n\nthese proceedings with one point being clear in people's minds,\n\nit's that.\"     Without surgery, he added, \"the degree of likelihood\n\nof [Kosilek] suffering serious medical consequences up to and\n\nincluding suicide are exceedingly high.\"         As for antidepressants,\n\nthey are for the treatment of patients with major depressive\n\ndisorder, which Dr. Brown stressed Kosilek did not have.                   With\n\nregards   to     gender   identity       disorder,     such     antidepressant\n\nmedications had been shown to be \"very ineffective\" as they might\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fonly slightly relieve some depressive symptoms but would not treat\n\nthe underlying gender identity disorder.             Only surgery, Dr. Brown\n\ntestified,   had   the      \"significant     potential\"   to   cure   Kosilek's\n\nmedical condition.\n\n           Next came Dr. Kenneth Appelbaum's testimony.               The Fenway\n\nCenter doctors, he said, had significant experience in the area of\n\ngender identity disorder and were well-trained, credentialed, and\n\nknowledgeable.         He   thought   their      assessments   were   typically\n\nreasonable and consistent with the approaches followed by most\n\nother medical providers. In general, Dr. Appelbaum did not see why\n\nthe DOC would need to consult with Osborne (an out-of-state,\n\nmaster's-level social worker) given that it had already received\n\nthe recommendations of the Fenway Center doctors (a local physician\n\nand doctoral psychologist), who were, in Dr. Appelbaum's mind,\n\nhighly experienced in dealing with gender identity disorder.                 As\n\nfor Osborne, Dr. Appelbaum recalled that the DOC's Hughes had\n\ncommented that she would be more sensitive to the DOC's concerns\n\nbecause   she    did    not    believe     sex    reassignment   surgery    was\n\nappropriate in the corrections setting.               Finally, Dr. Appelbaum\n\ntestified that from his conversations with Kosilek's treatment team\n\nat the prison, it was his understanding Kosilek had shown good\n\nadjustment being on hormones and receiving therapy.\n\n           Dr. Randi Kaufman from the Fenway Center then took the\n\nstand.    She reiterated the conclusion she made in her report, in\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fparticular that Kosilek had successfully completed the real-life\n\nexperience contemplated by the Standards of Care.         She also\n\ntestified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, there\n\nwas a \"very high likelihood\" Kosilek would attempt suicide if\n\ndenied treatment for her gender identity disorder.   Though Kosilek\n\nbenefitted from being on hormones, Dr. Kaufman felt Kosilek had a\n\nlevel of gender identity disorder that could not be treated with\n\nanything less than surgery. \"She's done all the things that people\n\ndo to change their gender presentation,\" she said, and \"[t]here\n\nreally isn't anything left except for surgery.\"      Kosilek had a\n\nmedical need for the surgery.\n\n          Mark Burrowes, a licensed mental health counselor with a\n\nmaster's degree in counseling psychology, who had been treating\n\nKosilek for four or five years, also testified.        Kosilek, he\n\nagreed, was ready for sex reassignment surgery.      Not having the\n\nsurgery would be detrimental and could result in Kosilek making an\n\nattempt on her life.   Suicide monitoring would not be an adequate\n\nalternative to surgery since Kosilek's male genitalia still caused\n\nher distress.\n\n          Finally, Michelle Kosilek was called by her attorneys.\n\nShe spoke about her life at MCI-Norfolk.   Generally she got along\n\nquite well with most of the people there, though a small percentage\n\nof the correction officers gave her a hard time.       Kosilek had,\n\nsince she got to prison, worked on a daily basis.     She testified\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fthat the hormone treatments had made her a little less depressed\n\nbut she continued to feel distress over her body.     Kosilek, who\n\nsaid she was not currently suicidal, felt the hormones were not\n\nenough and she needed surgery. She did not want to continue living\n\nwith her male genitalia and, if denied surgery, antidepressants and\n\npsychotherapy would not help matters.\n\n          The DOC then put on its case.    First, Chester Schmidt,\n\nM.D., a psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and\n\nassociate director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Sexual Health\n\nand Medicine, testified as an expert for the DOC.        He became\n\ninvolved in this case through his connection with Cynthia Osborne.\n\nAs to his general approach for treating patients with gender\n\nidentity disorder, Dr. Schmidt stated he does utilize the Standards\n\nof Care but thinks of them more as protocols or guidelines, as\n\nopposed to actual standards of care.    He does not agree with the\n\nidea, set forth in the Standards of Care, that sex reassignment\n\nsurgery is medically necessary in patients with severe gender\n\nidentity disorder. In fact, Dr. Schmidt did not recall ever seeing\n\na case where he thought surgery was medically necessary.    It was\n\nhis and his Johns Hopkins colleagues' practice to neither advocate\n\nnor speak against a patient's desire for surgery, but to leave it\n\nin the hands of the patient.      He would not send a letter of\n\nrecommendation to a surgeon on behalf of a patient, but he would\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\frelease his file to the surgeon and simply indicate he saw no\n\ncontraindications to surgery.\n\n              After giving his general overview, Dr. Schmidt turned his\n\nfocus to Kosilek, whom he had personally evaluated in November\n\n2005.    Kosilek did meet the criteria for gender identity disorder,\n\nhe concluded.      However, Dr. Schmidt did not believe surgery was\n\nmedically      necessary   as   Kosilek,    he    theorized,      had       made   an\n\n\"excellent adaptation\" without surgery thus far.             He also felt the\n\nreal-life experience contemplated in the Standards of Care was\n\nvirtually impossible to replicate in prison.                But besides this\n\nbarrier, Dr. Schmidt admitted he did not see any contraindications\n\nto surgery. Should Kosilek become depressed if she did not receive\n\nthe    surgery,   Dr.   Schmidt   thought   she    could    be    treated      with\n\nantidepressants      and   psychotherapy,    and    managed      in     a    medical\n\nfacility should her suicidal desires become severe.                   This latter\n\nscenario was a possibility, as Dr. Schmidt recognized Kosilek's\n\nrisk of suicide based on what she had said and done in the past.\n\nBut,    Dr.   Schmidt   opined,   psychotherapy     and    medications         could\n\neffectively reduce Kosilek's dysphoria to a level where she was no\n\nlonger at risk for serious harm.\n\n              Next Cynthia Osborne, the Johns Hopkins social worker and\n\nDOC consultant, gave testimony echoing Dr. Schmidt. By the time of\n\ntrial, she had met with and interviewed Kosilek.                 Osborne agreed\n\nwith Kosilek's severe gender identity disorder diagnosis.                      Yet,\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\flike Dr. Schmidt, in general, she did not believe the real-life\n\nexperience called for by the Standards of Care could happen in a\n\nprison environment.   Also, Kosilek was not, in her opinion, a good\n\ncandidate for sex reassignment surgery, nor was it medically\n\nnecessary, because Kosilek had responded very well to hormone\n\ntreatment. Rather, Osborne thought support groups or group therapy\n\ncould be used to treat Kosilek effectively.   Kosilek's threats of\n\nsuicide if denied surgery did not change Osborne's mind on what\n\ntreatment was warranted.    Indeed, she minimized concerns about\n\nsuicide by noting that any good mental health system would know how\n\nto deal with a patient's suicidality.     Osborne, again like Dr.\n\nSchmidt, did not fully agree with the Standards of Care's statement\n\nthat sex reassignment surgery is medically necessary in cases of\n\nsevere gender identity disorder.\n\n          Luis Spencer, then still Superintendent of MCI-Norfolk,\n\nalso testified for the DOC.      He explained the set-up at MCI-\n\nNorfolk, describing it as having one of the more secure perimeters\n\nin Massachusetts.     It is surrounded by walls on all sides, an\n\nelectrified fence, and guard towers which are manned twenty-four\n\nhours a day, seven days a week.    Approximately one-third of the\n\ninmates at MCI-Norfolk, Spencer explained, are serving a life\n\nsentence and one-third have committed sexual felonies.\n\n          Spencer also testified about Kosilek.   She had adjusted\n\nfairly well to life at MCI-Norfolk and had not reported any threats\n\n\n                               -32-\n\for harassment from other inmates.              As of the time of trial, no\n\nsecurity concerns involving Kosilek had arisen; however, Spencer\n\nhad some apprehension going forward should Kosilek receive the\n\nsurgery.     He would have \"grave concerns\" putting Kosilek back in\n\nthe general population with the full anatomy of a female.              Spencer\n\nworried that she could be raped or assaulted and he saw no\n\nalternative     but   to   house   her    in    the   high-security    Special\n\nManagement Unit.      This unit was a standalone secure building where\n\nKosilek would remain in her cell twenty-three hours a day and could\n\nonly   leave   when   shackled     and   escorted     by   two   guards.     The\n\nquestioning also briefly touched on Kosilek's threats of suicide\n\nwere she not to receive the surgery.             Spencer said his policy is\n\nnot to negotiate with inmates who threaten suicide, as to do so\n\nwould undermine his and the staff's authority.               Rather, he would\n\nimplement the DOC's mental health policy and take the appropriate\n\nsteps to guard a suicidal inmate's safety.\n\n             Gregory Hughes, who was the DOC's Director of Mental\n\nHealth and Substance Abuse Services until 2005, and who holds a\n\nmaster's degree in social work, was questioned next.                       Hughes\n\ntestified about the aftermath of Kosilek I and the DOC's efforts to\n\ncomply with the court's decision. His role included overseeing and\n\nfacilitating the services supplied to Kosilek, and in particular\n\nmaking happen the independent evaluation Judge Wolf ordered in\n\nKosilek I.     He testified about his dissatisfaction with the Fenway\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fReport, questioning its thoroughness and its heavy reliance on\n\nKosilek's self-reporting.      He was concerned that the doctors had\n\nnot reviewed any of Kosilek's medical records or mental health\n\nhistory or interviewed other people to verify Kosilek's self-\n\nreports.    And while Hughes knew the doctors suggested surgery, he\n\nsaid   he    was   uncertain    about    whether   there   were   other\n\nrecommendations and what next step the DOC should take. Because he\n\nwas concerned with the Fenway Report's quality, Hughes had decided\n\nto contact Osborne.     Hughes also testified that he reported his\n\nconcerns about the report to Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer and that the\n\nDOC sought their thoughts during staff meetings.       Hughes recalled\n\nthe doctors saying there were no contraindications to surgery but\n\ndid not believe they used the term \"medically necessary.\"\n\n            Robert Dumond, who was the Director of the DOC's Research\n\nand Planning Division, and who had previously provided mental\n\nhealth screenings at MCI-Framingham, testified on the DOC's behalf.\n\nDumond, who had a master's degree in psychology and experience in\n\nthe areas of victimization and sexual assault in the prison system,\n\nwas asked by the DOC to consider the risk factors for post-\n\noperative individuals in prison. Placing Kosilek at MCI-Framingham\n\npost-surgery, he responded, could \"destabilize[] the safety and\n\nsecurity of the institution\" and create a risk for Kosilek to\n\nbecome a victim or victimizer.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\f              Arthur Beeler was also called by the DOC to testify about\n\nsecurity issues.        Beeler, a thirty-year employee with the Federal\n\nBureau of Prisons, was warden at the Federal Correction Complex,\n\nFederal Medical Center in Buckner, North Carolina.                  Beeler toured\n\nMCI-Norfolk and MCI-Framingham, spoke with Superintendent Spencer,\n\nand reviewed the DOC's mental health policies in preparation for\n\nhis testimony.         In his opinion, Kosilek was currently safe and\n\nsecure   at    MCI-Norfolk,    based    in    part    on    the    set-up    of    the\n\nfacilities and her cell and the fact that Kosilek had never been\n\nassaulted     there.      Beeler     indicated   that       he    \"would    be    very\n\nconcerned\" about placing Kosilek in the women's general population\n\nat   MCI-Framingham      and   was   satisfied       that   the    mental    health\n\nprocedure at MCI-Norfolk was sufficient to address inmate suicide\n\nideation and behavior.         Beeler cautioned against giving in to an\n\ninmate's threats of suicide, likening it to opening Pandora's box.\n\nBeeler was not permitted to testify specifically about whether\n\nsecurity concerns should preclude Kosilek from getting surgery\n\nbecause, the court found, he was not sufficiently informed about\n\n\"the facts concerning Kosilek\" because Beeler had not looked at her\n\ndisciplinary or medical records.\n\n              Susan Martin, the DOC's Director of Health Services\n\nduring the relevant time period, was next up.               After speaking some\n\nabout the contractual relationship between the DOC and UMass,\n\nMartin turned to the Fenway Center's evaluation of Kosilek.                       Like\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\fHughes, she was not satisfied with the evaluation.   Martin did not\n\nthink the Fenway Report was very thorough and she raised this\n\nconcern to UMass at the time. Though Martin knew the Fenway Center\n\ndoctors were recommending surgery, she did not think they were\n\nclear enough about what exactly needed to happen and when. Because\n\nof these perceived omissions, Martin decided to have Osborne review\n\nthe report.\n\n          When asked about UMass's role, Martin indicated she\n\nthought it was UMass's job to determine whether the Fenway Center's\n\nrecommendations \"were medically necessary and clinically sound,\"\n\nand UMass, she said, would not do this.   She considered it UMass's\n\nresponsibility to find a surgeon, and simply providing the DOC with\n\na list of possible surgeons was not sufficient.\n\n          Next came DOC Commissioner Kathleen Dennehy's testimony.\n\nIf faced with a court order compelling the DOC to provide Kosilek\n\nwith sex reassignment surgery, Dennehy said she would probably\n\nretire before implementing something she considered unsafe.    And\n\nbased \"strictly [on] safety and security concerns\" she said she\n\nwould still veto the surgery even if UMass told her it was\n\nmedically necessary and even if Kosilek would likely attempt\n\nsuicide if denied the surgery.    (Dennehy claimed she was still\n\nawaiting clear direction from UMass.)\n\n          When asked, Dennehy acknowledged her awareness of the\n\nnegative public attention that Kosilek's bid had been receiving.\n\n\n                               -36-\n\fShe admitted she knew that a Massachusetts senator, who she was\n\nfriendly with and who had spoken in the news piece, vocally opposed\n\nsex   reassignment    surgery    for    inmates    and   was     pushing    for\n\nlegislation to put a stop to its provision.         She also said she knew\n\nof the Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor's opposition to surgery\n\nfor transgender inmates.\n\n          Finally,     Lynne    Bissonnette,      Superintendent     of     MCI-\n\nFramingham, was called upon to discuss the feasibility of Kosilek's\n\npost-operative placement there.        She explained the set-up at MCI-\n\nFramingham.   The women lived in multi-person rooms or dormitory-\n\nstyle housing units, with the exception of the women in the\n\nsegregation or medical units who had single cells.               For the most\n\npart the buildings at MCI-Framingham were surrounded by a single,\n\nnon-electrified      twelve-foot-high     fence.         There    had      been,\n\nBissonnette indicated, no prisoner escapes during her three-year\n\ntenure at Framingham.\n\n          As for the population at the facility, according to\n\nBissonnette, a large majority of the women there had been victims\n\nof domestic violence or sexual assault.             Also, a majority had\n\nmental health issues with about a half receiving medication for\n\nthose issues.     Bissonnette stated that if a woman could not\n\neffectively be maintained by the mental health professionals at the\n\nprison, she was sent for inpatient treatment at a Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Mental Health facility, where security was not the\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fequivalent of what was provided at the prison.                   And whereas\n\nMassachusetts      provides   a   special    secure       hospital    for   male\n\nprisoners,      Bridgewater   State   Hospital,     she   explained     that   no\n\ncomparative facility exists for women.\n\n              Bissonnette's    testimony     then     turned     to      Kosilek\n\nspecifically, whose criminal record she had reviewed.                Bissonnette\n\ndid not think Kosilek was an appropriate candidate to be housed at\n\nMCI-Framingham post-operatively and noted several concerns. First,\n\nBissonnette considered Kosilek a flight risk based on the weak\n\nperimeter at MCI-Framingham, the length of Kosilek's sentence, and\n\nthe fact that Kosilek had fled Massachusetts after killing her\n\nwife.18      Second, Bissonnette worried about the lack of available\n\ninpatient mental health care.         Kosilek would have to be sent to a\n\nless secure hospital for the general public should she require\n\ncare.        Third, Bissonnette considered Kosilek both a potential\n\npredator and victim within the inmate population — a predator\n\nbecause Kosilek had strangled her wife and a victim because a large\n\nproportion of MCI-Framingham's population had been the victims of\n\ndomestic violence and sexual abuse and might seek to harm her.\n\nFurther, and for essentially those same reasons, Bissonnette felt\n\nKosilek would have a negative effect on the prison population.\n\n\n\n\n        18\n       Bissonnette considered Kosilek's earlier flight, even though\nthe DOC classification manual says pre-custodial flight should not\nbe considered when classifying inmates.\n\n                                      -38-\n\f            In light of all of these concerns, were Bissonnette\n\nrequired to house Kosilek, she would put her in the Close Custody\n\nUnit, the single cell segregation unit, where inmates cannot hold\n\nany employment and are placed in restraints whenever they leave the\n\ncell.     Since Kosilek is serving a life sentence, Bissonnette\n\nexpressed    concern   that   housing    her   in   an    environment   this\n\nrestrictive for such an extended period of time would have a\n\nnegative impact on Kosilek's mental health.\n\n            On cross-examination Bissonnette made a few concessions.\n\nShe agreed that MCI-Framingham currently houses approximately forty\n\noffenders who are serving life sentences for murder.           Further, the\n\ninstitution houses in the general population inmates who are\n\nconvicted of heinous crimes against children alongside prisoners\n\nwho are mothers.       Bissonnette explained that if inmates are\n\nperceived to experience trauma based on the presence of other\n\ninmates, there are policies and procedures in place to follow (such\n\nas simply ordering a cell transfer) and the mental health and\n\nsecurity staff would respond appropriately.              Though Bissonnette\n\nagain acknowledged Kosilek could be housed in the Close Custody\n\nUnit safely, she persisted that this was not the \"best setting for\n\nany inmate over a long period of time.\"19\n\n\n     19\n       During the first round of testimony some more negative press\ncame out. The Boston Globe ran an editorial on June 15, 2006,\nwhich took the position that Kosilek should not receive the\nsurgery. The editorial referred to the \"distastefulness of a wife\nkiller angling to serve out his sentence of life without parole in\n\n                                  -39-\n\f             2. Responses to the First Round of Testimony\n\n             After the first bout of testimony, which concluded at the\n\nend of June 2006, Judge Wolf then directed the UMass doctors to\n\nreview Dr. Schmidt's testimony and to inform the court whether the\n\nlatter's     proposed     approach    was     within    prudent    professional\n\nstandards.     Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer responded in a report filed\n\nwith the court on September 18, 2006.             They continued to endorse\n\nthe Fenway Center doctors' conclusion that Kosilek had a serious\n\nmedical need requiring surgery.             In their opinion, Dr. Schmidt's\n\nproposed alternative course of psychotherapy, medication, and\n\nsuicide watch fell \"outside the bounds of acceptable professional\n\nstandards\" and would not constitute \"adequate medical care.\"                 Such\n\ninterventions     would    \"likely     do    little\"    to   reduce   Kosilek's\n\ndysphoria    or   the   risk   of    harm   to   her.    Only     surgery,   they\n\nconcluded, could do this, and there was \"no good clinical reason to\n\nwithhold that treatment at this time.\"\n\n             The judge also ordered Dennehy to review the evidence\n\npresented at trial and decide whether the DOC would reverse its\n\nposition on surgery for Kosilek. After doing so, Dennehy indicated\n\nto the court that Drs. Appelbaum's and Brewer's testimony confirmed\n\nwhat she suspected (but apparently did not previously find clear):\n\nthat the doctors believed surgery was medically necessary. Dennehy\n\nstood firm though; she advised Judge Wolf that her decision not to\n\n\na women's prison.\"\n\n                                      -40-\n\fallow sex reassignment surgery for Kosilek remained.                Her safety\n\nand security concerns with providing surgery, which Dennehy called\n\n\"alarming and substantial,\" had not changed.\n\n                      3. Second Round of Testimony\n\n            Testimony resumed in early October 2006, with various\n\nwitnesses    taking   and   re-taking       the   stand.    First    came   Dr.\n\nAppelbaum, who emphasized several points.             Kosilek had a serious\n\nmedical need because there was a serious risk of harm if she was\n\nnot adequately treated; and he had informed Dennehy of this.\n\nAntidepressants were unlikely to effectively treat Kosilek because\n\nthe source of her distress was her gender identity disorder and\n\nmedication would not target this underlying condition.                 Rather,\n\nsurgery,    he    explained,   was    the    \"recognized    and   appropriate\n\ntreatment\" and the only treatment \"likely to significantly relieve,\n\nif not eliminate Miss Kosilek's distress.\"\n\n            Dr. Kevin Kapila from the Fenway Center also spoke.             He\n\ncalled Kosilek's gender identity disorder \"one of the more severe\n\ncases\" he had ever seen and he testified about the report he and\n\nDr. Kaufman had written.       In his opinion, Kosilek had a serious\n\nmedical need and there was a substantial risk of harm if she was\n\nnot treated with surgery.            Dr. Kapila also testified that he\n\nthought     Dr.    Schmidt's    recommendation        was   unreasonable.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Kapila (who had reviewed Dr. Schmidt's testimony)\n\nopined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Dr.\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\fSchmidt's plan to treat Kosilek with psychotherapy and medication\n\nwas inadequate.      Pointing to his own evaluation of Kosilek after\n\nshe had been receiving psychotherapy and hormones for seventeen\n\nmonths, Dr. Kapila noted her symptoms had still not resolved; \"she\n\nstill was dealing with discomfort around having male genitalia.\"\n\nDr. Schmidt's approach would not deal with this core problem — only\n\nsurgery could — and, Dr. Kapila continued, one tries to treat the\n\nproblem, not merely the symptoms.\n\n           Dr.     Kaufman   then   got    recalled.       While   she    agreed\n\nKosilek's dysphoria had improved as a result of receiving hormone\n\ntreatments and gender-appropriate items and clothing, Dr. Kaufman\n\npersisted in opining that Kosilek still had a serious medical need\n\nand if she did not receive surgery there was a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm.    Despite all the treatment Kosilek had received, she\n\nstill continued to experience severe dysphoria.              Like Dr. Kapila,\n\nDr. Kaufman did not think the treatment advocated by Dr. Schmidt\n\nwas adequate.      It is important to distinguish between depression\n\nand dysphoria, she said, and Dr. Schmidt's treatment would not\n\nsufficiently address the latter.\n\n           UMass's Medical Director, Dr. Arthur Brewer, was up next.\n\nHe had little to add to the testimony of the other medical\n\nproviders because, as medical director, he was not involved in\n\nUMass's   mental    health   program      and   had   no   role   in   Kosilek's\n\ntreatment.      His position remained the same as in his and Dr.\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fAppelbaum's September 18, 2006 letter, which supported the Fenway\n\nCenter doctors and criticized Dr. Schmidt's approach.\n\n             Judge Wolf then again heard from Commissioner Dennehy.\n\nShe accepted that Kosilek had a serious medical need but said she\n\nhad previously been confused about whether surgery was medically\n\nnecessary.     While she had now \"deduced\" UMass's opinion on the\n\nappropriateness of surgery for Kosilek, she had not changed her\n\nthoughts on the security and safety concerns related to providing\n\nsuch surgery. Absent these concerns, Dennehy agreed she would have\n\nno reason to interfere with any medical order for treatment.\n\n             The court questioned Dennehy about her awareness of any\n\npublicity surrounding Kosilek's case.    Dennehy was generally aware\n\nof a couple of articles appearing in the Boston papers and admitted\n\nskimming one.     She also knew about an article on a national news\n\nmedia website. In general she tried not to read newspaper articles\n\nthat involved her and she never thought about what the public and\n\npolitical reaction would be if the DOC allowed Kosilek to have\n\nsurgery.\n\n                     4. The Court-Appointed Expert\n\n             After hearing all the witnesses each side wished to\n\npresent, Judge Wolf decided to appoint an expert in order to help\n\nhim decide whether the care proposed by Dr. Schmidt was objectively\n\nadequate.    See Fed. R. Evid. 706 (providing that the court may on\n\nits own initiative appoint an expert).        After soliciting the\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fparties' thoughts on who to appoint, Judge Wolf selected Stephen\n\nLevine, M.D., on October 31, 2006.    Dr. Levine practiced at the\n\nCenter for Marital and Sexual Health in Ohio and was a clinical\n\nprofessor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School\n\nof Medicine.   The court informed Dr. Levine that Kosilek had been\n\nliving as a woman in prison and instructed him to treat this case\n\nas if Kosilek were just another patient out in free society,\n\nwithout all the issues attendant to her being incarcerated.\n\n          A month later, Dr. Levine, who did not interview Kosilek,\n\nissued a written report.    Commenting on the views held by Drs.\n\nBrown and Schmidt, he noted they \"reflect the current polarities\n\nwithin psychiatry\" with each of their respective positions having\n\nmerit.   He wrote that \"Dr. Schmidt's view, however unpopular and\n\nuncompassionate in the eyes of some experts in GID, is within\n\nprudent professional community standards.\"\n\n          In addition to submitting his report, Dr. Levine also\n\ntestified on December 19, 2006.   At first, he reiterated that the\n\ntreatment recommended by Dr. Schmidt, though perhaps not popular,\n\nwas within prudent professional standards.   He thought Kosilek had\n\nobtained a good amount of relief from being on hormones and\n\ndressing as a woman and was probably as feminine as she was going\n\nto be; surgery would be \"icing on the cake\" he said.   Dr. Levine,\n\nlike Dr. Schmidt, stopped short of saying that Kosilek would try to\n\nkill herself if she was denied surgery.   He thought it was just a\n\n\n                               -44-\n\fpossibility and Kosilek's impulse could perhaps change over time.\n\nAnd, he added, even if Kosilek received the surgery, it was\n\npossible that, having nothing left to fight for, she could still\n\nexperience    an   emotional   crisis   and   contemplate   suicide.      In\n\ngeneral, Dr. Levine had criticisms of both Dr. Schmidt's and Dr.\n\nBrown's reports, but he thought they were both reasonable.\n\n             During questioning by Judge Wolf, it seemed Dr. Levine\n\nhad not followed some of the court's directives about not taking\n\ninto account the fact that Kosilek was in prison.                  Presuming\n\nKosilek would never be free, Dr. Levine did agree Kosilek had lived\n\na real-life experience as a woman in prison.        He also believed she\n\nessentially met all the eligibility and readiness requirements for\n\nsurgery under the Standards of Care.            Dr. Levine opined that\n\nproviding Kosilek with surgery, assuming she had met the real-life\n\nexperience     requirement,    would    be    consistent    with     prudent\n\nprofessional practice.     And although Dr. Levine had earlier in his\n\ntestimony found Dr. Schmidt's approach to be prudent, he clarified\n\nthat putting aside issues such as cost and security, it would not\n\nbe within prudent professional standards to deny Kosilek surgery.\n\n             After hearing Dr. Levine's testimony, the court asked the\n\nUMass doctors to prepare a written letter indicating what treatment\n\nthe DOC would propose as a possible alternative to surgery.            In a\n\nletter filed with the court on February 22, 2007, Dr. Brewer\n\nindicated that, after consulting with Drs. Kapila and Kaufman, he\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\ffelt that, if denied surgery, Kosilek should receive psychotherapy\n\nand should continue to receive hormones and feminine clothes and\n\nitems.   However, Dr. Brewer hastened to add what Drs. Kapila and\n\nKaufman had repeatedly advised him: such treatment was \"likely\n\ngoing to be ineffective to relieve Ms. Kosilek's distress and may\n\nwell result in self harm or suicide.\"\n\n                       5. Third Round of Testimony\n\n             Trial picked back up on March 15, 2007, with Kosilek\n\nagain calling Dr. Kaufman, as well as an additional witness, Dr.\n\nMarshall Forstein of Harvard Medical School and the Cambridge\n\nHealth Alliance.\n\n             Dr. Forstein, who had evaluated Kosilek on behalf of the\n\nDOC around the time of Kosilek I (and testified in that trial),\n\nevaluated Kosilek again in 2005. Kosilek called on Dr. Forstein to\n\naddress whether surgery was appropriate and if psychotherapy would\n\nbe a reasonable alternative to surgery.            Sex reassignment surgery,\n\nDr. Forstein opined, was the only reasonable treatment for Kosilek\n\nfor preventing the potential for self-mutilation or death.                   He\n\nthought surgery was probably not appropriate for actively suicidal\n\npatients, but he did not find Kosilek to be so.                    Nor did Dr.\n\nForstein think psychotherapy or antidepressants were reasonable\n\nalternatives to surgery for Kosilek.\n\n             Dr.   Kaufman   again   made    her   views   clear    during   her\n\ntestimony:    \"We   don't    recommend      psychotherapy.     We    recommend\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\fsurgery.\"      Psychotherapy,   she   said,    does   not   relieve   gender\n\nidentity disorder, especially when it is severe: \"rather than\n\ntrying to change the mind, we find that we need to change the\n\nbody.\"    After this testimony, both parties rested.\n\n                6. Commissioner Clarke Enters the Fray\n\n             On May 2, 2007, Dennehy informed the court she was no\n\nlonger commissioner of the DOC and James Bender had taken her\n\nplace.      Bender's tenure was short and he never testified.            His\n\nsuccessor, Harold Clarke, became commissioner in November 2007.\n\n             In April 2008, the court ordered Clarke to review certain\n\ntrial transcripts, to submit a report of his conclusions, and to\n\noffer testimony at a hearing to be held the following month.\n\nClarke submitted his report to the court on May 7, 2008.20            In it,\n\nhe   took     the   same   stance   as     Dennehy    had   before    him.\n\n\"Insurmountable\" is how Clarke characterized his concerns attendant\n\nto providing Kosilek with sex reassignment surgery.            Ticking off\n\nseveral of those concerns, Clarke claimed that transporting Kosilek\n\nout of the state for surgery would pose a flight risk based on\n\nKosilek's life sentence and her exodus from the state after killing\n\nher wife.21    Next, he claimed there were flight risks with housing\n\n\n     20\n       In connection with preparing the report, Clarke read the\ntestimony of Kosilek, Dennehy, Spencer, and Bissonnette. He had\nalso reviewed several trial exhibits including the Fenway Report\nand Dr. Seil's report.\n     21\n        Like Bissonnette, Clarke considered Kosilek's earlier\nflight, even though the DOC classification manual says pre-\n\n                                    -47-\n\fKosilek post-surgery at MCI-Framingham, as it was not as secure as\n\nMCI-Norfolk, and Kosilek would pose a risk to the female inmates\n\nand vice versa.   Clarke opined that the only viable post-operative\n\noption would be to place Kosilek in the Special Management Unit at\n\nMCI-Norfolk where she would be on lock down twenty-three hours a\n\nday.\n\n           Clarke's written report highlighted other problems he\n\nenvisioned.    An out-of-state transfer was not a viable option\n\nbecause there was no guarantee another state would take Kosilek or,\n\nif it did, that the state would keep her.            Nor did Clarke think a\n\nspecial unit for inmates with gender identity disorder would work\n\nas such inmates vary greatly in their security and treatment needs.\n\nFurther, providing Kosilek with surgery in response to her threats\n\nof suicide would be \"contrary to well-established correctional\n\npractices.\"   Inmates should not \"be permitted to manipulate the\n\nsystem   utilizing   a   'do   it   or   else'    theory.\"   All   of   these\n\nconclusions, Clarke explained, were based on his own correctional\n\nexperience, and he expressly disclaimed reliance on any political,\n\nmedia, or cost-related influences.\n\n           A few days after submitting his report, on May 12 and 13,\n\n2008, Clarke came before Judge Wolf.             He reiterated the security\n\nconcerns outlined in his report, but was forced to make a few\n\nconcessions on cross-examination. Clarke did not know that Kosilek\n\n\ncustodial flight should not be considered when classifying inmates.\n\n                                    -48-\n\fwas, at that time, fifty-eight years old; he had assumed she was\n\nmuch younger.     Prisoners in their fifties, he agreed, generally\n\ncease to be aggressive and have a calming effect in the prison\n\nenvironment.    Clarke, who did not consult with any of the prison\n\nsuperintendents in connection with his review, had also never read\n\nKosilek's recent classification report and was not aware of her\n\nexcellent disciplinary record.      Yes, he was aware Kosilek had been\n\ntransported to scores of doctor's appointments without any attempt\n\nat escape and he agreed that if need be the DOC could, \"with some\n\ndegree of certainty,\" safely transport Kosilek for surgery out of\n\nstate.   Clarke also acknowledged that his previous employer, the\n\nState of Washington Department of Corrections (he had been the\n\nsecretary of this DOC), had housed without any issues a post-\n\noperative   female   transgender   inmate,   who   was   serving   a   life\n\nsentence for murdering his sister, in one of its women's prisons.\n\n            Clarke was also asked about some letters he had recently\n\nreceived from Massachusetts lawmakers.       In particular, a few days\n\nafter he was ordered by the court to testify, Clarke received a\n\nletter signed by seventeen Massachusetts state senators voicing\n\ntheir concerns over Clarke's review of Kosilek's case.                 The\n\nsenators \"urge[d]\" Clarke to deny Kosilek's request for surgery as\n\nit would be an \"affront to the taxpayers\" and \"raise a significant\n\nsecurity risk.\"      A decision in favor of Kosilek would \"send the\n\nwrong message to the citizens of Massachusetts.\"         Around that same\n\n\n                                   -49-\n\ftime Clarke received another letter signed by twenty-five state\n\nrepresentatives. Similar sentiments were expressed in that letter.\n\nThe representatives vented their \"outrage\" at Kosilek's request,\n\nciting state budget concerns, and contended providing the surgery\n\nwould \"set a bad precedent.\"     At trial, Clarke said he did not\n\nrespond to the letters as he thought it would be inappropriate\n\ngiven the review he was tasked with. Nonetheless, Clarke was aware\n\nthe lawmakers were drafting legislation seeking to limit the\n\nstate's ability to expend funds in this case.      He was not however\n\n(he said) influenced by the legislators' ire or any of the media's\n\nanti-Kosilek coverage.\n\n                    7. The Trial Comes to an End\n\n            After Clarke completed his testimony, the parties made\n\nclosing statements.    Then, two years after it had begun, Kosilek's\n\ntrial came to an end.     No more testimony was taken by the court\n\nafter May 2008.   In total the court had sat for twenty-eight days\n\nof trial.    However time rolled on, and in 2009 and again in 2011\n\nJudge Wolf heard additional arguments from the parties to address\n\nrecent judicial decisions and developments.\n\n                      G. The Kosilek II Decision\n\n            On September 4, 2012, after confirming with the parties\n\nthey had nothing new to report, Judge Wolf issued his decision.\n\nSee Kosilek II, 889 F. Supp. 2d at 190.    The decision was lengthy\n\n(126 pages); it contained a thorough history of Kosilek's quest, a\n\n\n                                 -50-\n\fdetailed summary of the evidence adduced at trial, and loads of\n\nfactual findings.         In order to prevail on her claim, Judge Wolf\n\nfound    Kosilek      had     to     prove     five    things:    the     first     two\n\nconsiderations      as      part    of   the    Eighth     Amendment's     objective\n\ncomponent, the last three as part of its subjective prong. Kosilek\n\nhad to establish that: (1) she has a serious medical need; (2) the\n\nneed can only be adequately treated with sex reassignment surgery;\n\n(3) the DOC knows that Kosilek is at a high risk for serious harm\n\nif surgery is not performed; (4) the DOC did not deny Kosilek the\n\nsurgery based on a legitimate penological purpose, namely good\n\nfaith,     reasonable        security        concerns;     and   (5)      the     DOC's\n\nunconstitutional conduct will continue in the future. The decision\n\naddressed each piece in turn.\n\n             First,      with      respect     to    the   serious   medical       need\n\ncomponent,    the     court     found    that       credible   evidence    at     trial\n\nestablished that Kosilek suffered from severe gender identity\n\ndisorder and would suffer serious harm if it was not adequately\n\ntreated.      The court focused on Kosilek's threat of suicide\n\n(determined to be credible and not manufactured) and the fact that\n\nmultiple highly qualified doctors employed by the DOC had diagnosed\n\nKosilek with a severe form of gender identity disorder, a diagnosis\n\nconfirmed by Drs. Brown and Forstein.                      The court's takeaway:\n\nKosilek had established a serious medical need.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -51-\n\f            On point two — what treatment was adequate to address\n\nthis need — the court found the following.            The Standards of Care\n\ndictated a three-part sequence that called for hormone therapy, a\n\nreal-life experience living as the opposite sex, and then sex\n\nreassignment surgery (though not all patients need or want all\n\nthese things).     Kosilek of course had been on hormone therapy and\n\nthe court concluded the evidence showed that she underwent a real-\n\nlife experience living as a woman in prison.           The court found Drs.\n\nBrown,    Kaufman,     and   Forstein     credible   when    they   testified,\n\nconsistent with the Standards of Care, that surgery was medically\n\nnecessary for some individuals with severe gender identity disorder\n\nand, indeed, medically necessary for Kosilek herself.                  It also\n\nconcluded, relying in part on the opinions of Drs. Appelbaum and\n\nLevine,   that   Dr.    Schmidt's   proposed     alternative     treatment   of\n\npsychotherapy, antidepressants, and suicide watch did not meet\n\nprudent professional standards.             More specifically, the court\n\ndetermined     that    Dr.    Schmidt's     categorical     views   about    sex\n\nreassignment     surgery,     including    his   refusal    to   recommend   sex\n\nreassignment surgery for patients, were not supported by the\n\nStandards of Care.           Moreover, the treatment advocated by Dr.\n\nSchmidt would not treat the cause of Kosilek's mental anguish (it\n\nwould diminish the symptoms at most) or reduce her suffering to the\n\npoint that she no longer had a serious medical need.                    Having\n\ndetermined that Kosilek had proven she had a serious medical need\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\fthat had not been treated adequately, the court decided that\n\nKosilek had satisfied the objective prong of the Eighth Amendment\n\ntest.   The court then turned its attention to the so-called\n\nsubjective prong: in essence, did the DOC know of and disregard an\n\nexcessive risk to Kosilek's health.\n\n          The court started with the third issue it had outlined —\n\nwhether the DOC knew that Kosilek was at risk for serious harm if\n\nsurgery was not performed.     As a threshold matter, the court\n\nconsidered who within the DOC should be its focus as far as who\n\nknew what and when.     The court determined, based in part on\n\nstipulations from the parties, that former DOC Commissioner Dennehy\n\nwas the sole decision-maker on the issue of whether security\n\nconcerns should preclude Kosilek from getting surgery.     And Dr.\n\nAppelbaum of UMass, it decided, should be the focus of the court's\n\ndetermination about whether the DOC was aware that Kosilek had a\n\nserious need for surgery.    Ultimately though, the court decided\n\nthis was a distinction without a difference because the evidence\n\nestablished that both Dennehy and Dr. Appelbaum were aware of facts\n\nfrom which they could infer — and did in fact draw the inference —\n\nthat \"a substantial risk of serious harm to Kosilek existed.\"   The\n\ncourt focused on Dr. Appelbaum's numerous communications with\n\nDennehy in which he advised her of the serious risks faced by\n\nKosilek if the Fenway Center's proposed course of treatment was not\n\nundertaken.   It also looked to the fact that Dennehy had read the\n\n\n                               -53-\n\fKosilek I decision, read testimony in this case, and that, in her\n\nown testimony, she ultimately did not dispute that Kosilek had a\n\nserious medical need.\n\n             The court's analysis proceeded to the fourth factor —\n\nthat   is,   whether    the   DOC    denied   Kosilek    surgery    based     on   a\n\nlegitimate penological purpose.          First, the court explained it is\n\nnot legally permissible to deny a prisoner medical treatment based\n\non cost alone, but the court did not find cost to be the basis for\n\nthe DOC's decision here.            Noting the DOC's provision of various\n\nexpensive     medical    treatments      to   many   prisoners,       the     court\n\nspecifically declined to find that the DOC's denial of surgery to\n\nKosilek was motivated by the high cost of the treatment. The court\n\nthen moved on to the main bone of contention, which was whether the\n\nDOC's proffered security concerns were its real reason for denying\n\nKosilek surgery.       If the DOC's decision was made in good faith and\n\nbased on reasonable security concerns, the court said it would\n\ndefer to the DOC's decision.           However, such deference was not to\n\nbe.    Quite the contrary, the court found that, after a long period\n\nof    pretense   and    prevarication,     Dennehy      persisted   in      falsely\n\nasserting that providing Kosilek with the surgery would present\n\ninsurmountable     security    concerns.       The   court    found    Dennehy's\n\nsecurity excuses nothing more than a pretext to deny Kosilek\n\nsurgery.      Indeed, it was a \"fear of controversy, criticism,\n\nridicule, and scorn\" that was the real driving force behind the\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\fDOC's decision to withhold surgery.    In support of its conclusion,\n\nthe court cited Dennehy's pattern of delay, deviation from DOC\n\npolicy, feigned ignorance about what treatment DOC doctors were\n\nrecommending, failure to do a thorough security evaluation before\n\nmaking up her mind, the unrealistic nature of the supposed security\n\nrisks, and the public and political outcry against Kosilek.            It\n\nsummed things up this way: \"Because there is no penological\n\njustification for denying Kosilek the treatment prescribed for\n\n[her], [s]he is now being subject to the 'unnecessary and wanton\n\ninfliction of pain' prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\n           Expressing a reticence to tell the DOC how to discharge\n\nits duty, and lamenting the fact that the DOC had not just made the\n\nproper medical decisions on its own, the court moved on to the\n\nfinal consideration, which was whether the DOC's unconstitutional\n\nconduct, absent court intervention, would continue.       Based on the\n\nDOC's pattern of unconstitutional conduct as chronicled above, the\n\ncourt determined the DOC's deliberate indifference would not cease\n\nwithout   judicial   intervention.     Kosilek   was   entitled   to   an\n\ninjunction.   Because an injunction must be narrowly tailored, the\n\ncourt declined to decide who should do the surgery, where it should\n\nbe done, or where Kosilek should be housed afterwards.            Rather\n\nJudge Wolf simply ordered the DOC to provide Kosilek with sex\n\nreassignment surgery.      The order read: \"Defendant shall take\n\n\n\n\n                                -55-\n\fforthwith all of the actions reasonably necessary to provide\n\nKosilek sex reassignment surgery as promptly as possible.\"\n\n          The DOC quickly filed this appeal and moved the district\n\ncourt to stay its order to provide Kosilek with surgery pending\n\nresolution of the appeal, which the court did.\n\n                     II. THE ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n          After setting forth the extensive backdrop of Kosilek's\n\nodyssey, we start by narrowing the issues before us.       On appeal,\n\nthe DOC attacks the district court's decision but limits its\n\noffensive to just a couple of issues.     To start, it does not take\n\numbrage with many of the district court's findings, namely that\n\nKosilek has a serious medical need, that the DOC knows she has a\n\nserious medical need, that surgery could appropriately treat this\n\nneed, or that injunctive relief (should the DOC's conduct be deemed\n\nunlawful) is an appropriate vehicle for relief.      And based on the\n\nevidence adduced at trial, we think the DOC would not have had\n\nstrong arguments on any of these points.\n\n          The two basic criticisms the DOC levels at the district\n\ncourt's decision are the following.       First, it claims the court\n\nerred in finding that the DOC's decision not to provide Kosilek sex\n\nreassignment   surgery   constitutes    inadequate   medical   care   in\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.      Second, it contends the court\n\nerred in finding the DOC deliberately indifferent to Kosilek's need\n\nfor treatment.   We elaborate.\n\n\n                                 -56-\n\f           On    point    one,   the    DOC   argues   that    surgery    is    not\n\nconstitutionally required because the treatment Kosilek is already\n\nreceiving — psychotherapy, hormones, permanent hair removal, and\n\naccess to female clothing and cosmetics — is adequate. Kosilek, it\n\ncontends, is not entitled to the most sophisticated or desirable\n\ntreatment or to curative treatment, as opposed to treatment for her\n\nmental illness.          And should Kosilek engage in self-injurious\n\nbehavior (e.g., attempt to commit suicide) if denied surgery, the\n\nDOC   contends     treating      this     behavior     with         methods    like\n\npsychotherapy, antidepressants, and a protective environment would\n\nbe adequate.     In sum, the DOC thinks the court erred when it found\n\nthe DOC's current and proposed treatment course inadequate (i.e.,\n\nfailed to meet prudent professional standards) under the Eighth\n\nAmendment and the sex reassignment surgery medically necessary.\n\n           Kosilek disagrees. She counters that the court correctly\n\nfound surgery to be the only adequate treatment for her serious\n\nmedical need — a finding supported by more than ample evidence.\n\nKosilek points out that almost all of the medical professionals who\n\ntestified at trial agreed this was the case, and only the DOC's\n\nexperts   disagreed;      Kosilek      says   the   court     was    entitled    to\n\ndisbelieve them.     She claims the evidence also establishes that,\n\neven with hormones and psychotherapy, her mental anguish is severe\n\nand the DOC's proposed course of treatment would not sufficiently\n\n\n\n\n                                       -57-\n\freduce this.     Sex reassignment surgery is medically necessary,\n\naccording to Kosilek.\n\n           As to the court's deliberate indifference finding, the\n\nDOC contends the court erred in rejecting the safety and security\n\nconcerns presented by DOC officials at trial in support of their\n\ndecision to withhold surgery, which they say were based on their\n\nbest correctional judgment and were reasonable and not pretextual.\n\nThe DOC \"vigorously disputes\" that the public criticism of Kosilek\n\nand her request for surgery had any impact on the decision-making\n\nprocess of Commissioner Dennehy or her successor, Clarke. However,\n\nother than this broad assertion it says little else about Dennehy\n\nherself and her motives. Instead it homes in on Dennehy's ultimate\n\nsuccessor Clarke, claiming that he should be the focus of this\n\ncourt's determination as to the validity of the security concerns\n\nvoiced by the DOC (despite the DOC's at-trial stipulation that\n\nDennehy was the operative decision-maker).22         There was an absence\n\nof evidence in the record, says the DOC, that Clarke's proffered\n\nsecurity concerns were exaggerated or made in bad faith and so, the\n\ncourt was required to accord him deference.             Further, the DOC\n\npoints    out   Kosilek   offered    no    counter   correctional   expert\n\ntestimony, and the district court did not find that Superintendent\n\n\n\n     22\n       At oral argument counsel for the DOC clarified that he does\nnot suggest that this court disregard Dennehy's testimony, only\nthat it should focus on Clarke's as it is more relevant being\ncloser in time.\n\n                                    -58-\n\fBissonnette or Spencer acted in bad faith or were tainted by a fear\n\nof public criticism.\n\n           On the court's deliberate indifference finding, Kosilek\n\nargues that the DOC had no legitimate security reason to withhold\n\nsurgery and importantly, more than sufficient evidence supported\n\nthe court's conclusion that the alleged security concerns were\n\npretextual.    Kosilek points to several pieces of evidence: the\n\nsecurity decision was made before any security review occurred; a\n\nsubsequent security review did not follow DOC procedure; the\n\nsecurity report was hastily drafted by trial counsel; and the\n\nsecurity evaluation that was performed did not take into account\n\ncertain    fundamental   factors    like       Kosilek's   age   and     good\n\ndisciplinary record.     Kosilek adds that there was evidence that\n\nKosilek's transportation to surgery and post-operative placement\n\nwould not be actually impossible from a security perspective.             As\n\nsuch, no \"mechanical deference\" is owed to the DOC, according to\n\nKosilek,   whose   argument   focuses     on   the   illegitimacy   of   the\n\nproffered security concerns rather than the supposed role public\n\ncriticism played in the DOC's decision.         Kosilek also lambasts the\n\nDOC for attempting to distance itself from Dennehy on appeal since\n\nbelow the DOC stipulated that Dennehy's motivations should be the\n\nfocus and in fact objected to Clarke's testimony as unnecessary.\n\n           With the arguments delineated and the issues narrowed, we\n\nturn to the operative law.\n\n\n                                   -59-\n\f                     III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT CRITERION\n\n              The Eighth Amendment provides the vehicle through which\n\ncourts scrutinize \"the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and\n\nthe conditions under which he is confined.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. 825, 832 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).              One way\n\nprison officials violate the Eighth Amendment is when they fail to\n\nprovide an inmate with adequate medical care, such that \"their\n\n'acts    or   omissions     [are]   sufficiently   harmful   to    evidence\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.'\"               Leavitt v.\n\nCorr. Med. Servs., Inc., 645 F.3d 484, 497 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing\n\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976)).              To prevail on an\n\nEighth Amendment inadequate medical care claim, a plaintiff must\n\nsatisfy two inquiries, one objective and one subjective.              Id.\n\n              The objective component requires that \"the deprivation\n\nalleged must be, objectively, sufficiently serious.\"              Farmer, 511\n\nU.S. at 834 (internal quotation marks omitted); Leavitt, 645 F.3d\n\nat 497.   Thus an Eighth Amendment claim such as this one turns, in\n\npart, on whether the prisoner has a \"serious medical need,\" in\n\nother words, \"one that has been diagnosed by a physician as\n\nmandating treatment, or one that is so obvious that even a lay\n\nperson    would    easily   recognize   the   necessity   for     a   doctor's\n\nattention.\"       Mahan v. Plymouth Cnty. House of Corr., 64 F.3d 14,\n\n18-19 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).                     A\n\nprisoner is entitled to adequate medical care for that need, though\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\fthis   does    not     necessarily    mean     the    most     sophisticated    care\n\navailable.     United States v. DeCologero, 821 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).   Rather, adequate care is \"services at a level reasonably\n\ncommensurate        with   modern    medical    science        and   of   a   quality\n\nacceptable within prudent professional standards.\"                    Id. at 43.\n\n              For    the   subjective    prong       to   be    satisfied,     prison\n\nofficials must have had \"a sufficiently culpable state of mind\";\n\nthat is, they showed deliberate indifference to an inmate's health\n\nand safety.         Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834; Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 497.\n\n\"Deliberate indifference means that a prison official subjectively\n\nmust both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\n\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also\n\ndraw the inference.\"        Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullán, 485 F.3d 150, 156 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).                       To establish a\n\nsubjective intent, \"a deliberate intent to harm is not required,\"\n\nrather \"it is enough for the prisoner to show a wanton disregard\n\nsufficiently evidenced 'by denial, delay, or interference with\n\nprescribed health care.'\"           Battista v. Clarke, 645 F.3d 449, 453\n\n(1st Cir. 2011) (quoting DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 1991)).\n\n              If a court finds that the Eighth Amendment's objective\n\nand subjective prongs have been satisfied, it may grant appropriate\n\ninjunctive relief.         Farmer, 511 U.S. at 846.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -61-\n\f                            IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n               Here    Kosilek's     Eighth     Amendment   claim   was   heard\n\nexclusively by a judge.        When this court decides an appeal from a\n\njudgment following a bench trial, different standards of review are\n\nat play. Wojciechowicz v. United States, 582 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n               First, questions of law engender de novo review.            Id.\n\nFindings of fact, however, are reviewed only for clear error. Id.\n\nThis means we accept the court's factual findings unless the\n\nevidence compels us to conclude contrarily that a mistake was made,\n\n\"keeping in mind that the district judge had the opportunity to\n\nassess the credibility of the witnesses.\"              Janeiro v. Urological\n\nSurgery Prof'l Ass'n, 457 F.3d 130, 138 (1st Cir. 2006).                  \"'This\n\ndeferential standard extends . . . to inferences drawn from the\n\nunderlying facts,' and 'if the trial court's reading of the record\n\n[with respect to an actor's motivation] is plausible, appellate\n\nreview is at an end.'\"             Id. at 138-39 (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Smith v. F.W. Morse & Co., 76 F.3d 413, 420 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)).   Finally, with mixed questions of law and fact, there is a\n\ncontinuum. Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1132 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).           The more fact-intensive the question, the more\n\ndeferential our review.            Id.   Conversely, the more law-dominated\n\nthe question, the more likely our review moves toward a de novo\n\nlook.    Id.\n\n\n                                         -62-\n\f                Before going any further we address a point of dispute\n\namong the parties.          While everyone agrees that the above standard\n\nof review controls, the parties disagree on how to apply it.23\n\nKosilek argues that the district court's determinations on the\n\nadequacy of the medical care and the viability of the purported\n\nsecurity rationale are findings of fact and therefore this court's\n\nreview is for clear error only.            The DOC, however, claims that the\n\ncourt's conclusion regarding the appropriateness of Kosilek's\n\nhealth care is a conclusion of law engendering de novo review; it\n\ndoes not address at all what standard should apply to the court's\n\ndeliberate indifference finding.               Neither side gives us any legal\n\nsupport for the respective positions they take in this debate.\n\n                This court has not provided clear guidance; however, we\n\nare not left totally in the dark.              For one, we have explained that\n\na   \"state-of-mind         issue   such   as     the   existence   of   deliberate\n\nindifference usually presents a jury question,\" Torraco v. Maloney,\n\n923 F.2d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1991), in other words an issue for the\n\nfinder     of    fact.24     Further,      when    reviewing   a   trial   judge's\n\n\n      23\n        In violation of our rules, the DOC did not include a\nstandard of review in its opening brief.    See Fed. R. App. P.\n28(a)(9)(B).   Not until its reply brief did we learn the DOC's\nstance on this important issue.\n      24\n       The Eighth Circuit has held that \"whether an official was\ndeliberately indifferent to [an] inmate's serious medical need\" is\na question of fact. Schaub v. VonWald, 638 F.3d 905, 915 (8th Cir.\n2011). On the other hand, the Fifth Circuit has characterized it\nas a legal conclusion resting on certain facts. Walker v. Butler,\n967 F.2d 176, 178 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                          -63-\n\fdetermination on the adequacy of medical treatment following a\n\nbench        trial,   this   court   has    applied    the    deferential   clearly\n\nerroneous standard.           DesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19-20.25          And it is\n\nwell established that \"elusive issues of motive and intent\" (at\n\nplay here in connection with the subjective prong) are typically\n\nfact-bound ones subject to the clearly erroneous rule.                         Fed.\n\nRefinance Co. v. Klock, 352 F.3d 16, 27-28 (1st Cir. 2003); see\n\nalso McIntyre ex rel. Estate of McIntyre v. United States, 545 F.3d\n\n27, 40 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                On top of all this, the district court here \"engaged in\n\na careful and close analysis of the trial evidence\" and therefore,\n\ngiven the fact-intensive nature of the court's inquiry, we are\n\nsatisfied that the court's findings — that the DOC refused to\n\nprovide        medically     necessary     treatment    for    a   serious,   life-\n\nthreatening medical condition that could be accommodated without\n\nsecurity risk — should be reviewed for clear error only.                       See,\n\ne.g., Turner v. United States, 699 F.3d 578, 584 (1st Cir. 2012).\n\nTo the extent that any of the court's findings could be viewed as\n\nmore akin to a mixed question of law and fact or even a legal label\n\n(the most arguable one being whether the DOC's conduct amounted to\n\ndeliberate indifference), some deference is still appropriate. See\n\n\n        25\n       The Ninth Circuit seems to take a similar approach.    It\ndescribed a dispute about whether \"any option other than surgery\nwas medically acceptable\" for an inmate alleging an Eighth\nAmendment violation as an \"issue of fact.\" Snow v. McDaniel, 681\nF.3d 978, 988 (9th Cir. 2012).\n\n                                           -64-\n\fBattista, 645 F.3d at 454 (\"The legal labels applied to facts are\n\nreviewed on appeal more closely than a district court fact-finding,\n\nbut often with some deference to the district judge.\"); Fed.\n\nRefinance Co., 352 F.3d at 27 (explaining that the more fact-\n\nintensive the question the more deferential our review).26\n\n          The dissent first diverges from this opinion on the\n\nstandard of review issue.   While our dissenting colleague agrees\n\nthat a continuum (anchored on one side by de novo review and on the\n\nother by clear error review) is at play, he is not convinced that\n\nthe district court's controlling findings should be reviewed on the\n\nclear error end of the spectrum.      However, the dissent does not\n\nexplain how any of the findings made by the district court, which\n\n\n     26\n        Our precedent indicates that where a district court's\ndecision threatens to intrude on a party's First Amendment rights,\nwe must \"make an independent examination of the whole record\" in\nreviewing a decision that there is no such intrusion. Bose Corp.\nv. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499 (1984) (quoting\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285 (1964)). But we\nare aware of no precedent for importing this elevated review into\nother contexts not implicating a need to guard against judicial\nrestriction of First Amendment rights. Supreme Court decisions\ncertainly signal no license to extend Bose Corp. beyond First\nAmendment cases. See Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 145 (1986)\n(\"[N]o broader review is authorized [under Bose Corp.] simply\nbecause this is a constitutional case.\"); Hernandez v. New York,\n500 U.S. 352, 367-69 (1991) (refusing to apply elevated review\nunder Bose Corp. and instead applying clear error review to a claim\nunder the Equal Protection Clause); Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S.\n30, 78-79 (1986) (doing the same in a claim of vote dilution under\nthe Voting Rights Act).        And as our dissenting colleague\nperceptively explained in another opinion, it is not clear that a\nheightened standard would apply even if this were a First Amendment\ncase, because the district court did not reject but sustained the\nassertion of a constitutional right. United States v. Frabizio,\n459 F.3d 80, 96 (1st Cir. 2006) (Torruella, J., concurring).\n\n                               -65-\n\fled   to   the   result   we   are   affirming,   are   anything   more   than\n\nquintessentially factual findings.           And while the dissent argues\n\nthat we must review de novo the district court's conclusion that\n\nthe facts demonstrate an Eighth Amendment violation, where a legal\n\nconclusion flows directly from factual findings, our review of\n\nthose factual findings — and thus the overall conclusion — remains\n\ndeferential.      For example, in a recent Eighth Amendment case\n\nsimilar to this one, we reviewed the district court's determination\n\nthat the state had been deliberately indifferent to the needs of a\n\nprisoner suffering from gender identity disorder by asking whether\n\nthe court had a \"reasonable basis\" for its conclusion, not whether\n\nthe district court actually reached the right decision.            Battista,\n\n645 F.3d at 454-55.       Here, the success of Kosilek's claim depends\n\nalmost entirely on questions of credibility (in assessing the\n\nstate's motives) and on questions of medical care (in assessing\n\nKosilek's medical needs). These are exactly the kinds of questions\n\nthat we must review deferentially, especially where, as here, there\n\nis ample testimony precisely and directly supporting the district\n\ncourt's answers to such questions.\n\n            With the parameters of our review cleared up, we move on\n\nto the merits of this case.\n\n                          V. THE OBJECTIVE PRONG\n\n            As we said, the DOC does not dispute that Kosilek has a\n\nserious medical need. The real issue is whether the district court\n\n\n                                      -66-\n\ferred in finding that the care the DOC has provided Kosilek with\n\n(i.e., hormones, psychotherapy, and feminine items) and proposes to\n\nprovide her with to relieve any self-injurious behavior (i.e.,\n\npsychotherapy, antidepressants, and a protective environment) is\n\nadequate.    Said another way, is, as the district court found, sex\n\nreassignment surgery medically necessary and the only appropriate\n\ntreatment for Kosilek?\n\n            Our review starts off with the DOC's expert Dr. Schmidt,\n\nwho the district court concluded was not a prudent professional.27\n\nThis finding was not clearly erroneous.         First, Dr. Schmidt\n\nexpressed a good deal of disagreement with the Standards of Care.28\n\nHowever, the Standards of Care were widely relied upon and trusted\n\nby the other medical providers who testified at trial and have been\n\ncited by the courts as generally accepted.   See, e.g., De'Lonta v.\n\nJohnson, 708 F.3d 520, 522-23 (4th Cir. 2013) (describing the\n\n\n     27\n       In its decision, the court noted it had considered Osborne's\ntestimony but was not discussing it separately because she\ntestified consistent with her colleague Dr. Schmidt and there was\na question as to whether she should even be considered in the\nprudent professional debate because she is a social worker and not\na medical doctor. We take the same tack and focus on Dr. Schmidt.\n     28\n       The Seventh Version of the Standards of Care, which, as\nindicated, came out in 2011, contains a new section addressing the\napplicability of the standards to persons living in institutional\nenvironments such as prison or long-term care facilities.\nStandards of Care, Version 7, at 67. It indicates that, for those\npersons, health care \"should mirror that which would be available\nto them if they were living in a non-institutional setting\" and\nthat \"[a]ll elements of assessment and treatment as described in\nthe [Standards of Care] can be provided to people living in\ninstitutions.\" Id.\n\n                                -67-\n\fStandards of Care as \"the generally accepted protocols for the\n\ntreatment of GID\"); Soneeya v. Spencer, 851 F. Supp. 2d 228, 231\n\n(D. Mass. 2012) (noting that the \"course of treatment for Gender\n\nIdentity Disorder generally followed in the community is governed\n\nby the 'Standards of Care'\"); O'Donnabhain v. Comm'r of Internal\n\nRevenue, 134 T.C. 34, 65 (U.S. Tax Ct. 2010) (indicating that the\n\nStandards are \"widely accepted in the psychiatric profession, as\n\nevidenced by the recognition of the standards' triadic therapy\n\nsequence as the appropriate treatment for GID and transsexualism in\n\nnumerous psychiatric and medical reference texts\").\n\n             More specifically, the Standards of Care, which the\n\nparties agree are applicable in some regard to the treatment of\n\ngender identity disorder (though the DOC would certainly like to\n\nsee them given less weight than Kosilek would), provide for a\n\ntriadic approach: a real-life experience in the preferred gender\n\nrole, hormones of the desired gender, and surgery to alter one's\n\ngenitalia.      The Standards of Care indicate that for persons with\n\nsevere   gender    identity   disorder,      sex   reassignment      surgery   is\n\neffective.      Standards of Care at 18.           In such persons, surgery\n\npaired   with     hormone   therapy    and    a    real-life    experience     is\n\n\"medically indicated and medically necessary.\"                 Id.   Surgery is\n\nnot, the Standards of Care say, \"experimental, investigational,\n\nelective, cosmetic, or optional in any meaningful sense.\" Id. Dr.\n\nSchmidt, however, disagreed with the proposition that surgery is\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\fmedically necessary in cases of severe gender identity disorder.\n\nIn fact, he did not recall seeing a case of gender identity\n\ndisorder serious enough to require surgery in the approximately 300\n\npatients he has evaluated.   Dr. Schmidt's views regarding the need\n\nfor surgery for patients with severe gender identity disorder was\n\nnot only unsupported by the Standards of Care but also contradicted\n\nby the testimony of the other medical providers at trial.\n\n          As for what treatment was appropriate for Kosilek in\n\nparticular, Dr. Schmidt opined that surgery was not necessary as\n\nKosilek had done well just using hormones thus far.        The main\n\nbarrier Dr. Schmidt saw was that, in his opinion, a real-life\n\nexperience living as the opposite gender could not be effectively\n\nreplicated in prison.     Rather, Dr. Schmidt's proposed course of\n\ntreatment was to utilize psychotherapy and medication to reduce\n\nKosilek's dysphoria to a point where she was no longer at risk for\n\nserious harm.     Should her suicidal desires persist, Dr. Schmidt\n\nthought Kosilek could be effectively managed in a medical facility.\n\nHowever, a majority of the other medical providers who testified at\n\ntrial regarding Dr. Schmidt's proposed course of treatment thought\n\nit was unreasonable (namely, Drs. Kapila, Kaufman, Appelbaum, and\n\nForstein).29    The consensus was that Dr. Schmidt's approach would\n\n\n     29\n       We do not list Dr. Levine among these providers because, as\nthe reader will recall, there was some change in his testimony.\nInitially he opined that Dr. Schmidt's view, though unpopular, was\nreasonable. However, Dr. Levine apparently had disregarded the\ncourt's order to treat Kosilek as if she were a patient out in free\n\n                                -69-\n\fnot effectively treat the real issue, which was Kosilek's gender\n\nidentity disorder, or significantly relieve her distress to a level\n\nwhere she was not at risk for serious harm.             As Dr. Kapila\n\nexplained, Kosilek's symptoms and distress had not been resolved\n\nthough she had been on hormones for some time.\n\n             Ultimately,   the   court   was    confronted   with   two\n\ndiametrically opposed opinions, both given by qualified medical\n\nprofessionals. Given the contradictory evidence, which was heavily\n\nweighted against the DOC, we are far from left with the impression\n\nthat the trial court made a mistake when it determined that Dr.\n\nSchmidt was not a prudent professional or that his approach was\n\nunreasonable.     See Janeiro, 457 F.3d at 138.      The court did not\n\nclearly err.\n\n             The question that remains is what treatment is medically\n\nadequate to treat Kosilek.       The DOC twists the district court's\n\nholding, claiming that it impermissibly held that the Eighth\n\nAmendment requires treatment that actually \"cures\" the inmate's\n\ncondition.    The court said no such thing.    It simply found that the\n\nonly adequate treatment in this case was sex reassignment surgery.\n\n\n\nsociety.   After being reminded of those parameters, Dr. Levine\nclarified his opinion.    He said, putting aside a variety of\nconcerns about the surgery, including cost, security, and the\nrequirement of a \"real life experience,\" prudent professionals do\nnot ordinarily prevent a patient from receiving sex reassignment\nsurgery.   But even were we to disregard Dr. Levine's opinion\nentirely, there was ample evidentiary support for the court's\nconclusion that Dr. Schmidt's approach was not prudent.\n\n                                  -70-\n\fAnd   though,   according    to    the    experts,      surgery    did   have   the\n\npotential to cure or at least greatly alleviate Kosilek's gender\n\nidentity disorder, this does not translate to a finding by the\n\ncourt that only curative treatment passes constitutional muster.\n\nTo give an example, if Kosilek had cancer and the court found\n\nchemotherapy to be the only adequate treatment under the Eighth\n\nAmendment, as opposed to, say, an aspirin, it would not necessarily\n\nfollow that the court held that the Eighth Amendment requires an\n\ninmate to be cured.     The DOC's argument misses the mark.\n\n           However,    as    the    district      court   found,    there   is    a\n\ndifference between treating the underlying disorder and treating\n\nonly its symptoms.     The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals drew a\n\nsimilar distinction when it held that a Wisconsin statute which\n\nprohibited the state's department of corrections from providing\n\ntransgender inmates with hormones and sex reassignment surgery was\n\nunconstitutional.     Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 552-53, 559 (7th\n\nCir. 2011).      The court, discussing how some patients require\n\nhormone therapy, noted that although the defendant department could\n\n\"provide    psychotherapy          as    well      as     antipsychotics        and\n\nantidepressants, defendants failed to present evidence rebutting\n\nthe testimony that these treatments do nothing to treat the\n\nunderlying disorder.\"       Id. at 556.        The defendants failed to show,\n\nthe court concluded, that another treatment could be an adequate\n\nstand-in for hormone therapy.           Id.\n\n\n                                        -71-\n\f             And providing some treatment is not the same as providing\n\nadequate treatment.       The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in\n\nDe'Lonta, 708 F.3d at 520, reversed the district court's dismissal\n\nof a transgender inmate's Eighth Amendment claim.          The court found\n\nthat the inmate, who sought sex reassignment surgery because her\n\ngender identity disorder symptoms persisted despite receiving\n\nhormones, stated a plausible deliberate indifference claim. Id. at\n\n522, 525.     Notably the court found that just because the Virginia\n\nDepartment    of   Corrections    had   provided   the   inmate   with   some\n\ntreatment for her gender identity disorder (hormone therapy and\n\npsychological counseling) consistent with the Standards of Care,\n\n\"it does not follow that they have necessarily provided her with\n\nconstitutionally adequate treatment.\"          Id. at 522, 526.   The court\n\nadded that total deprivation of care is not a prerequisite for a\n\nconstitutional violation.        Id. at 526.\n\n             Here there was testimony from the medical providers at\n\ntrial that the preferred approach is to treat the underlying\n\nproblem (the gender identity disorder) and not just the symptoms,\n\nas Dr. Schmidt proposed. \"[Y]ou treat the primary problem, you\n\ndon't treat symptoms,\" Dr. Kapila testified.                And while the\n\nevidence, as recognized by the district court, was that Kosilek had\n\nshown improvement being on hormones and had obtained some measure\n\nof stability holding on to the hope of receiving surgery, all the\n\nmedical providers, save Dr. Schmidt, agreed that this was not\n\n\n                                    -72-\n\fenough. As the Fenway Center doctors concluded early on, all signs\n\nindicated that Kosilek was still quite distressed and likely to\n\nsuffer serious harm in the form of suicide if not operated on.\n\n            The take-away from the evidence: surgery was the next\n\nlogical adequate treatment step.              Kosilek had been on hormones for\n\nsome time and the evidence, in the form of reports and testimony\n\nfrom the Fenway Center doctors and Drs. Forstein and Brown,\n\nsupported   the     notion   that    Kosilek      had    undergone     a   real-life\n\nexperience living as a woman in prison.                    In fact, Dr. Brown\n\ntestified that in his opinion Kosilek had not only met the minimum\n\nreal-life experience but had exceeded it. Dr. Brown focused on the\n\namount of information (presumably the significant medical and\n\ndisciplinary   records       kept   in    a     prison   setting)     that   existed\n\nregarding Kosilek's time in prison.                  Dr. Brown would not, he\n\nexplained, have such a thorough record with a patient in the\n\noutside    world.     And    Dr.    Schmidt's      opinion     that    a   real-life\n\nexperience could never be replicated in prison did not take into\n\naccount Kosilek's situation in particular, or more generally the\n\ndifferent realities of transgender prisoners.                   As the district\n\ncourt found, \"[f]or someone like Kosilek who is serving a sentence\n\nof life without the possibility of parole, prison is, and always\n\nwill be, [her] real life.\"\n\n            With the prerequisites for surgery satisfied, Drs. Brown,\n\nKaufman,     Forstein,       Kapila,      and      Appelbaum     all       testified\n\n\n                                         -73-\n\funequivocally: sex reassignment surgery was medically necessary and\n\nthe only appropriate treatment for Kosilek.    And they all agreed\n\nthat a very likely consequence of Kosilek not receiving the surgery\n\nwas a serious risk of harm, predominantly suicide. Kosilek herself\n\ntestified, and the court found credibly so, that though hormone\n\ntreatments had helped, she still suffers intense mental anguish\n\nover her male genitalia and believed she needed surgery.        As\n\nKosilek explained, she did not want to continue living with her\n\nmale genitalia and antidepressants and psychotherapy would not\n\nchange that.\n\n          We are bound by certain well-established adages: a party\n\nchallenging findings of fact after a bench trial \"faces a steep\n\nuphill climb\" and this court \"is not at liberty to start afresh.\"\n\nMonahan v. Romney, 625 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2010) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Here there was ample evidence to support\n\nthe district court's conclusion that sex reassignment surgery was\n\nthe only adequate treatment for Kosilek.      In fact, substantial\n\nevidence, notwithstanding Dr. Schmidt's testimony, pointed in that\n\ndirection. The court did not clearly err in deciding to credit the\n\nevidence and testimony offered by Kosilek and in concluding that\n\nthe objective component of the Eighth Amendment inquiry had been\n\nsatisfied.     In sum, where at least three eminently qualified\n\ndoctors testify without objection, in accord with widely accepted,\n\npublished standards, that Kosilek suffers from a life-threatening\n\n\n                               -74-\n\fdisorder    that     renders    surgery      medically      necessary,    and   the\n\nfactfinder is convinced by that testimony, we are at a loss to see\n\nhow this court can properly overrule that finding of fact.\n\n                            VI. THE SUBJECTIVE PRONG\n\n             The   basis       for    the     district      court's      deliberate\n\nindifference conclusion was its findings that the DOC had no valid\n\npenological reason to deny surgery.               As indicated earlier, the\n\njudge primarily focused on Dennehy (as the parties stipulated),\n\nconcluding    that    she    delayed   treatment,     deviated     from     policy,\n\ninadequately reviewed security ramifications, and manufactured\n\nsecurity concerns.       The court also assessed Clarke's motivations\n\nand concluded that Clarke's failure to do a thorough security\n\nreview suggested he did not operate with an open mind.                   Also found\n\nto   be   important    on    both    the    Dennehy   and    Clarke   front:    the\n\nunrealistic nature, in the court's mind, of the supposed security\n\nrisks and the public and political outcry against Kosilek.                      The\n\nissue for this court to decide is whether the record supported\n\nthese underlying factual conclusions.\n\n             First, let us get a few things out of the way.                Though a\n\nlot of the public and political opposition to Kosilek receiving\n\nsurgery involved a rally cry that taxpayers should not have to foot\n\nthe bill for the procedure, the district court did not think that\n\ncost considerations played any role in the DOC's decision to deny\n\nsurgery.     And both the parties agree with this point on appeal;\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\fthere was no evidence that the DOC withheld surgery because it was\n\ntoo expensive.    Therefore we have no cause to consider the cost\n\nissue.30   Second, as alluded to, the parties disagree about whether\n\nDennehy or Clarke or both should bear the brunt of this court's\n\nattention on the validity-of-the-security-concerns issue. In suits\n\nlike this one, where injunctive relief is sought \"to prevent a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious injury from ripening into actual harm,\"\n\nwe consider deliberate indifference \"'in light of the prison\n\nauthorities' current attitudes and conduct,' [and] their attitudes\n\nand conduct at the time suit is brought and persisting thereafter.\"\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 845 (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25,\n\n36 (1993)).    Therefore we will look at both Dennehy and Clarke.\n\nWith those preliminary points dealt with, we proceed to the merits.\n\n\n\n\n     30\n       Although the DOC has not argued the cost issue, much media\ncommentary focused on the cost of sex reassignment surgery for\nKosilek, and a prior commissioner of the DOC claimed that the\nsurgery was an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds.         As the\ndistrict court noted in Kosilek II, one Boston Globe column from\n2000 griped that Kosilek was \"demanding that the state, meaning you\nand me, pay the $25,000 for a sex-change operation.\" 889 F. Supp.\n2d at 215.    While the record does not indicate if that number\nreflects the exact cost of the surgery today, it appears to be in\nthe ballpark. Yet, the cost of sex reassignment surgery pales in\ncomparison to the amount of money it seems the state will be\nexpending to defend this lawsuit. Around a year ago, Kosilek's\nattorneys filed a motion in the district court seeking to have the\nDOC pay them over $800,000 in fees and costs.       In a tentative\nruling issued from the bench, Judge Wolf indicated that he is\nplanning to order the DOC to pay around $700,000, though it does\nnot appear that this amount has yet been formalized in a written\norder.\n\n                                -76-\n\f             Clearly, when decisions about medical care are made in\n\nthe prison system, there are certain considerations not present in\n\nsociety at large. \"Any professional judgment that decides an issue\n\ninvolving conditions of confinement must embrace security and\n\nadministration and not merely medical judgments.\"      Battista, 645\n\nF.3d at 455. And because \"security considerations . . . matter at\n\nprisons\" and conflicting demands must be balanced by officials, the\n\ndeliberate indifference test \"leave[s] ample room for professional\n\njudgment.\"    Id. at 453, 454.\n\n             However, as we explained in Battista, at some point a\n\ndefendant forfeits the advantage of deference.       Id. at 455.   In\n\nBattista, which involved some of the same players as this case,\n\nthis court considered the claim of another transgender inmate suing\n\nthe Massachusetts DOC.     Id. at 450.   This court found the record\n\nsupported the district court's determination that the DOC had shown\n\ndeliberate indifference by refusing to provide the inmate with the\n\nhormone treatment that doctors had recommended for her.       Id. at\n\n450, 455.    As it does in this case, the DOC cited security concerns\n\nfor denying the recommended treatment.     Id. at 452.   Nonetheless,\n\nin reaching its result, the Battista court refused to give the DOC\n\nthe advantage of deference.      Id. at 455.   It cited a \"pattern of\n\ndelays, new objections substituted for old ones, misinformation\n\nand other negatives,\" including an initial failure to take the\n\ninmate's diagnosis of gender identity disorder and request for\n\n\n                                  -77-\n\fhormones seriously, the passage of years before a substantial\n\nsecurity justification was made, and the DOC's portrayal of the\n\nonly options as withholding hormones or placing the inmate in\n\nseverely constraining protective custody.       Id.\n\n          Here Judge Wolf found a very similar pattern of behavior\n\non the DOC's part and the record supports this finding.             On the\n\ndelay front, it has indisputably been many years since medical\n\nproviders started considering the propriety of surgery for Kosilek.\n\nDr. Forstein, back in then Commissioner Maloney's tenure (the years\n\n1997 to 2003) during the days of Kosilek I, had recommended that\n\nKosilek be allowed to consult with a surgeon who specialized in sex\n\nreassignment   surgery.    In   2003,     Dr.   Seil   made   the     same\n\nrecommendation, indicating that Kosilek should be allowed to meet\n\nwith a specialist after a year on hormones. Then in February 2005,\n\nthe Fenway Center doctors indicated after evaluating Kosilek that\n\nshe should be allowed to have surgery.     Dennehy herself was Deputy\n\nCommissioner during Kosilek I and was involved in the decisions\n\nmade in connection with that case.      And right when she started as\n\nCommissioner, Dennehy slowed things down.        She took the unusual\n\nstep in assuming an active role in a de novo blanket reassessment\n\nof the treatment of those inmates suffering from gender identity\n\ndisorder, including Kosilek, despite the fact that the DOC's\n\ncontract with UMass provided that the UMass medical professionals\n\nwould make the decisions about the medical care for inmates with\n\n\n                                -78-\n\fthis disorder and the Commissioner would only step in at the end to\n\nassess any security concerns.\n\n             The DOC explains away this delay by claiming that for a\n\nlong time it did not understand that UMass recommended surgery for\n\nKosilek, but the district court did not buy it.    And, in reality,\n\nthe issue seems to be one of semantics.    While there was testimony\n\nfrom Hughes and Martin that they knew UMass supported the Fenway\n\nCenter doctors' recommendation for surgery, they did not think\n\nUMass was clear enough on the logistics or whether surgery was\n\n\"medically necessary\" (as opposed to medically optional). However,\n\nDrs. Appelbaum and Brewer made pellucid in their June 14, 2005\n\nletter that they did not think it was within their purview to\n\ndecide as a legal matter whether surgery for Kosilek was medically\n\nnecessary.    Thus, in the end, there was evidence that the DOC knew\n\nthat Kosilek's medical providers were recommending surgery, and in\n\nresponse, the DOC dallied and disregarded.        This behavior is\n\nsignificant, as in order to establish a subjective intent, \"it is\n\nenough for the prisoner to show a wanton disregard sufficiently\n\nevidenced 'by denial, delay, or interference with prescribed health\n\ncare.'\" Battista, 645 F.3d at 453 (quoting DesRosiers, 949 F.2d at\n\n19); see also Johnson v. Wright, 412 F.3d 398, 404 (2d Cir. 2005)\n\n(A \"deliberate indifference claim can lie where prison officials\n\ndeliberately ignore the medical recommendations of a prisoner's\n\ntreating physicians.\").\n\n\n                                 -79-\n\f             While the DOC maintains that it opposed surgery based on\n\nsecurity concerns, the district court did not clearly err in\n\nfinding     that    these    concerns     followed      hasty,    results-driven\n\nevaluations.       Written procedure adopted by the DOC required that,\n\nsubsequent to a medical provider's recommendation that an inmate\n\nreceive treatment for gender identity disorder, the Superintendent\n\nin the relevant prison would conduct a security assessment and make\n\na recommendation to the Commissioner. Despite this policy, the DOC\n\nconcluded,     as    was    reported    in     the    news   piece    Dennehy     was\n\ninterviewed for, that surgery for Kosilek \"would result in a\n\nsecurity nightmare\" before it ever conducted such a review.\n\n             Once the security review was eventually undertaken, the\n\nDOC did not give itself much time to complete it.                Although the DOC\n\nwas ordered by the court back on April 25, 2005 to conduct the\n\nreview, Dennehy, the attorneys, and the superintendents did not\n\nmeet until May 19 to produce the report, which was due to the court\n\non May 27.         The report was then penned predominantly by trial\n\ncounsel and reviewed by Dennehy only a day or two before it went to\n\nJudge Wolf.        This pattern of haste continued.              On November 23,\n\n2005, just nine days before expert disclosures were due, Dennehy\n\ncontacted the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons looking for\n\na recommendation for a security expert to testify at trial.                     When\n\nthe   DOC   experts    did   testify,    it     was   apparent,      as   the   court\n\nexplained, that both Dumond and Beeler \"failed to consider material\n\n\n                                        -80-\n\faspects   of   Kosilek's    history    and   personal   characteristics   in\n\nforming their opinions,\" such as her good disciplinary record or\n\nher medical records.       As a result, the court gave their testimony\n\n\"little weight.\"\n\n           As for Clarke's security review, the court criticized him\n\nfor not consulting with Spencer, then still the Superintendent of\n\nMCI-Norfolk, and for apparently not reviewing any of the DOC's\n\nexpert security testimony offered at trial, when deciding whether\n\nhe agreed with Dennehy's stance on surgery.             The DOC calls this\n\nfinding disingenuous since the court's order only called for Clarke\n\nto review certain testimony and Clarke testified that accordingly\n\nthis is what he did.        It is unclear whether Clarke shirked his\n\nreview responsibilities or genuinely felt that his review was\n\nlimited in scope.    But both views are permissible and when faced\n\nwith two permissible views of the evidence, the district judge's\n\nchoice of one of them cannot be clearly erroneous.            See Monahan,\n\n625 F.3d at 46.      Plus the thoroughness of Clarke's review is\n\nundercut by the fact that he did not know some important pieces of\n\ninformation, such as Kosilek's age and excellent disciplinary\n\nrecord, when he advanced his security concerns.\n\n           Another denouement of the district court was that the\n\nsecurity concerns the DOC ultimately proffered (following its hasty\n\nreview) were \"largely false\" and \"greatly exaggerated.\"               This\n\nconclusion was not clearly erroneous. The DOC repeatedly protested\n\n\n                                      -81-\n\fthat transporting Kosilek to surgery out of state would pose an\n\ninsurmountable security risk.         On its face, the concern seems\n\npatently unrealistic.      First, the DOC undoubtedly has a large\n\namount of experience transporting prisoners within and outside of\n\nMassachusetts.      Further, the likelihood of Kosilek, who has been\n\ntransported    to   multiple   doctor's    appointments    without    issue,\n\nfleeing while traveling to receive the surgery that she has\n\ndedicated decades of her life to obtaining is improbable enough\n\nthat we need say nothing more.       Almost equally as unlikely is the\n\nidea that a now sixty-four year old, post-surgical, recovering\n\nKosilek would be able to escape when being transported back to\n\nprison. Even Clarke conceded that it was near certain that the DOC\n\ncould safely transport Kosilek to and from surgery.             On top of all\n\nthis, there was evidence that the surgery might be able to be\n\nperformed in Massachusetts.         An Illinois doctor testified at\n\ndeposition that he would be willing to evaluate Kosilek for surgery\n\nand   travel   to   Massachusetts    to    operate   on   her   if   all   the\n\nappropriate arrangements, such as licensing requirements, could be\n\nmade.\n\n           The DOC's argument that Kosilek's post-operative housing\n\nwould create a security risk is more plausible than its out-of-\n\nstate-transport one, but not enough for us to think the court\n\nclearly erred in not crediting it as a bar to surgery.            Ultimately\n\nthere was evidence of viable housing options for Kosilek.\n\n\n                                    -82-\n\f             Though the DOC claims that housing Kosilek in the general\n\npopulation at MCI-Norfolk or MCI-Framingham is not feasible, the\n\nevidence did not unequivocally support this proposition.       First,\n\nKosilek has been housed safely while living as a woman — wearing\n\nfemale clothing, using female cosmetics, and taking female hormones\n\nthat caused her to develop breasts and a feminine body shape — in\n\nthe general population at MCI-Norfolk for many years. Moreover, in\n\nconnection with Kosilek I, then Commissioner Maloney was adamant\n\nthat there were serious security concerns surrounding Kosilek\n\nremaining at MCI-Norfolk while receiving hormones.        He reasoned\n\nthat many inmates were sex offenders and a prisoner living as a\n\nfemale with female attributes such as breasts would create a risk\n\nof violence.     But once an actual security review was done, then\n\nSuperintendent Spencer reported that there were no current security\n\nconcerns with Kosilek being provided estrogen therapy.         And no\n\nsecurity issues ended up cropping up after that.     The DOC's about-\n\nface calls into question their present stance with regard to the\n\nimpact of surgery.\n\n             Second, with regard to housing Kosilek in the general\n\npopulation at MCI-Framingham, there was evidentiary support for the\n\ncourt's conclusion that the DOC's concerns were bogus or at least\n\noverblown.    For one, the DOC claimed men are stronger than women.\n\nBut Kosilek's perceived superior strength as a man did not jibe\n\nwith her advanced age, physically slight frame, or the fact that\n\n\n                                  -83-\n\fshe has been on female hormones for years.     Moreover, the DOC's\n\nclaim that she would be an escape risk based on the weak perimeter\n\nat MCI-Norfolk is also questionable when one considers Kosilek's\n\nexcellent disciplinary record and the fact that she would, at least\n\ninitially, be a post-operative patient.   And while the DOC pointed\n\nto Kosilek's life sentence as a factor compounding the risk of her\n\nescape, Bissonnette testified that MCI-Framingham already housed\n\naround forty life offenders and gave no explanation why Kosilek\n\nshould be viewed differently from these other lifers.   Finally, in\n\nrejecting the DOC's heightened flight risk contentions if Kosilek\n\nwere housed at MCI-Framingham, the court noted that according to\n\nthe DOC's classification manual, Kosilek's post-crime, one-time\n\npre-arrest flight (a flight embarked on twenty-three years ago)\n\nshould not even have been a consideration, even though Bissonnette\n\nclaimed it was.31\n\n          The potential for Kosilek causing inmate climate issues\n\nat MCI-Framingham due to the fact that she murdered her wife was\n\nanother theory the DOC floated in support of its security concern\n\n\n\n     31\n        According to both Spencer and Bissonnette, Kosilek also\ncould be safely housed in their respective high-security units,\nthough of course that would come with trade-offs for Kosilek as far\nas how restricted her life would be. Obviously Kosilek is aware of\nthose trade-offs and persists in her request for surgery.\n     There was also evidence of another scenario — an out-of-state\ntransfer for Kosilek.    The DOC's only counter to this was the\nspeculative ground advanced by Clarke that there was no guarantee\nanother state would take or keep Kosilek.        But there was no\nevidence that either of these scenarios were explored or probable.\n\n                               -84-\n\fargument.    But the possibility of one inmate being offensive to\n\nanother based on the crime the other inmate committed is not a new\n\nphenomenon, and the evidence was that there were procedures in\n\nplace to deal with these types of situations at MCI-Framingham,\n\nsuch as moving prisoners around.          Not to mention, as Clarke\n\nrecognized, his former employer, the Washington Department of\n\nCorrections, housed a post-operative female transgender inmate,\n\nalso serving a life sentence for murdering a female relation,\n\nwithout security or climate issues.\n\n            Aside from the DOC's purported security concerns, the\n\ncourt pointed to other evidence which it thought suggested the\n\nDOC's denial of surgery was not prompted by valid penological\n\nconcerns but rather a deliberate indifference to Kosilek's medical\n\nneeds. For instance, there was evidence that the DOC did not leave\n\nthings up to chance when it sought an opinion about whether an\n\noperation for Kosilek was even warranted.      The DOC knew before it\n\nretained Osborne that she was assisting other departments of\n\ncorrections in defending litigation filed by transgender prisoners.\n\nIn fact, Hughes specifically noted that Osborne would be more\n\nsympathetic to the DOC's concerns and that she did not believe that\n\nsex   reassignment   surgery   was   appropriate   in   the   corrections\n\nsetting.     It was not a stretch for the court to disbelieve\n\nDennehy's testimony that Osborne's very predictable opposition to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -85-\n\fproviding    Kosilek    with     surgery    did   not   play   a   role    in    her\n\nselection.\n\n             The public disapproval of Kosilek's quest was another\n\npiece of the puzzle.       Even though Dennehy and Clarke denied being\n\nmotivated by avoidance of public controversy, the district court\n\nfound this testimony lacking in credibility and concluded that\n\nDennehy and Clarke were keenly aware of and in fact motivated by\n\nthe outcry.         Evidence supporting the court's finding included\n\nDennehy's press appearance in the news piece featuring her senator\n\nacquaintance who opposed the surgery; Dennehy's testimony that she\n\nwas aware that some politicians were against Kosilek being provided\n\nwith surgery and that she was generally aware of the negative news\n\ncoverage; and Clarke's admission that he received the two letters\n\nfrom the seventeen unhappy state senators and twenty-five unhappy\n\nrepresentatives.\n\n             This    evidence    could     be   conceivably     viewed     as    not\n\noverwhelming in amount. However it was up to the district court to\n\nmake a credibility call, and Judge Wolf did not believe Dennehy's\n\nor Clarke's testimony on the impact of public opinion on their\n\ndecisions.    Credibility calls are something we seldom second guess\n\nin this context.         Rather we give due regard to the judge's\n\nopportunity    to    assess     witness    credibility.        Fed.   R.   Civ    P.\n\n52(a)(6); Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46.                This deference extends to\n\n\"inferences drawn from the underlying facts, and if the trial\n\n\n                                      -86-\n\fcourt's    reading   of   the     record   [with   respect    to     an   actor's\n\nmotivation] is plausible, appellate review is at an end.\" Janeiro,\n\n457 F.3d at 138-39 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration\n\nin original).   Here the district court's impression of Dennehy and\n\nClarke's    motivations     was    certainly    plausible.          Furthermore,\n\nadequate record support for a court's conclusion that \"'deliberate\n\nindifference'    has      been    established      —   or    an     unreasonable\n\nprofessional judgment exercised\" — can exist even though that\n\nindifference \"does not rest on any established sinister motive or\n\n'purpose' to do harm.\"       Battista, 645 F.3d at 455.            It is enough\n\nthat the district court had a reasonable basis for its perception\n\nthat the DOC had shown a pattern of \"delays, poor explanations,\n\nmissteps, changes in position and rigidities.\"                Id.     And as we\n\nchronicled above, there was ample evidentiary support for this\n\nfinding.   Finding no clear error, we defer to the district court's\n\nassessment of Dennehy's and Clarke's testimony and the other\n\nevidence on the issue.\n\n            Finally, the DOC offered one last argument to counter the\n\ncourt's finding of deliberate indifference.             Besides the various\n\nsecurity concerns it alleged, there was a good amount of testimony\n\nfrom DOC officials and experts that it is not wise to give in to\n\ninmate threats of suicide. The fear seems to be that other inmates\n\nwill mimic Kosilek's threats of suicide in order to receive some\n\nbenefit (let's say, desirous medical treatment or a preferable\n\n\n                                     -87-\n\fhousing assignment) based on Kosilek's threats in this case.                      As a\n\ngeneral proposition we agree that the DOC should not have to yield\n\nto   an   inmate's    threats.          However,   we    do    not    see    Kosilek's\n\nparticular suicide issue as quite the concern the DOC makes it out\n\nto be.     First, the evidence was that Kosilek, who had previously\n\nattempted both suicide and self-castration, did not manufacture a\n\nsuicide threat to game the system.              Sadly, it is not unheard of for\n\ninmates suffering from gender identity disorder to engage in self-\n\ndestructive behavior.       See, e.g., Konitzer v. Frank, 711 F. Supp.\n\n2d 874, 879 (E.D. Wis. 2010) (transgender inmate cut open and\n\nwounded his scrotum on multiple occasions while incarcerated);\n\nDe'Lonta    v.   Angelone,       330     F.3d    630,    632    (4th    Cir.    2003)\n\n(transgender inmate stabbed or cut his genitals on more than twenty\n\noccasions after the department of corrections stopped his hormone\n\nregimen).    Second, as far as other inmates are concerned, the DOC\n\nadmittedly employs competent mental health professionals who can no\n\ndoubt assess whether an inmate's threats of suicide are real or\n\nmanufactured.        And   if    they    are    real,   they    can    be    addressed\n\nappropriately on an individualized basis.                      Finally, and more\n\nfundamentally, even though deterring other inmates from potentially\n\nengaging in undesirable behavior may be a valid penal objective, it\n\nis not a reason to withhold medical care that has been deemed\n\nmedically    necessary     for    a     particular      inmate.        Our   ultimate\n\nconclusion: the district court did not err in finding the security\n\n\n                                         -88-\n\frationale submitted by the DOC for not providing Kosilek with\n\nsurgery largely false and greatly exaggerated.\n\n                              VII. CONCLUSION\n\n            We are assuredly mindful of the difficult tasks faced by\n\nprison   officials    every   day.     But    as    the   Supreme   Court   has\n\ncautioned, while sensitivity and deference to these tasks is\n\nwarranted,    \"[c]ourts    nevertheless      must   not   shrink    from   their\n\nobligation to 'enforce the constitutional rights of all 'persons,'\n\nincluding prisoners.'\"        Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1928\n\n(2011) (quoting Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321 (1972) (per\n\ncuriam)).     And receiving medically necessary treatment is one of\n\nthose rights, even if that treatment strikes some as odd or\n\nunorthodox.\n\n            Here the trial judge had the opportunity to preside over\n\ntwo lawsuits involving the same players and similar allegations, to\n\nhear evidence in this case over the course of a twenty-eight day\n\ntrial, to question witnesses, to assess credibility, to review a\n\nlarge volume of exhibits, and, in general, to live with this case\n\nfor twelve years (twenty years if you count Kosilek I).                The judge\n\nwas well-placed to make the factual findings he made, and there is\n\ncertainly evidentiary support for those findings.             Those findings\n\n— that Kosilek has a serious medical need for the surgery, and that\n\nthe   DOC   refuses   to   meet   that      need    for   pretextual    reasons\n\nunsupported by legitimate penological considerations — mean that\n\n\n                                     -89-\n\fthe DOC has violated Kosilek's Eighth Amendment rights.   The court\n\ndid not err in granting Kosilek the injunctive relief she sought.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                  -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                              -90-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, Dissenting. Lest we lose sight\n\nof the rule that we are called upon to enforce, stretching it\n\nbeyond    the   bounds    of    its   intended     purpose,      it   is    perhaps\n\nappropriate to begin by reciting the text of the Eighth Amendment:\n\n\"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,\n\nnor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"               U.S. Const. amend.\n\nVIII.    In applying any rule, precise demarcation of its reach is\n\nboth    appropriate    and     necessary.       Where    these   boundaries      are\n\nignored, the results are most often unforeseen, unintended, and\n\nunwarranted.      It     is    only   through    careful    attention       to   the\n\ncountervailing interests that prescribe the sweep of a rule that we\n\nare best able to identify both those situations that fall clearly\n\nwithin its bounds, and those complexities that skirt along its\n\noutermost edges.      Such limitations serve more than an exclusionary\n\npurpose; by establishing a rule's proper scope, they ensure the\n\neffectiveness    of    its     protections      when    correctly     and   adeptly\n\napplied.\n\n            With due respect to the majority, I am forced to dissent\n\nbecause I cannot support what is, in my view, an outcome that\n\nproceeds with little recognition of such boundaries.                  Instead, it\n\nallows to stand a decision that, finding its foundation in several\n\nerroneous assumptions, reaches a result beyond the limits of our\n\nestablished Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -91-\n\f                  I. Kosilek's History and Treatment\n\n             Michelle Kosilek (\"Kosilek\") is an anatomically male\n\nprisoner who suffers from severe gender identity disorder (\"GID\").\n\nIn 1992, Kosilek was convicted of murdering her32 wife and sentenced\n\nto life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.            While in\n\nprison,     Kosilek   legally    changed   her   name   from    \"Robert\"   to\n\n\"Michelle\" and began living as a woman to the extent possible\n\nwithin a male prison environment.          Kosilek has previously sought\n\nlegal redress for what she alleged were constitutional shortcomings\n\nin the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's treatment of prisoners with\n\nGID.    See Kosilek v. Maloney, 221 F. Supp. 2d 156 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\nResolved in 2002, this litigation failed to substantiate any Eighth\n\nAmendment violations but ultimately contributed to changes in the\n\ncare and treatment of GID prisoners, including Kosilek.\n\n             Today,   the    Massachusetts   Department    of    Corrections\n\n(\"DOC\") provides Kosilek with a bevy of ameliorative measures aimed\n\nat treating her GID.        These measures, as recommended by the DOC's\n\nmedical     advisors,   include:     psychotherapy,     hormone    therapy,\n\nelectrolysis for facial hair removal, and access to female clothing\n\nand personal items (including underwear and cosmetics) such as\n\n\n       32\n      The district court adopted masculine pronouns in reference\nto Kosilek's anatomical gender. See Kosilek v. Spencer, 889 F.\nSupp. 2d 190 (D. Mass. 2012). Kosilek, however, self-identifies as\nfemale and has undertaken significant efforts, including through\ntreatment provided by the DOC, to formalize this gender\npresentation. I therefore follow the majority's practice of using\nfemale pronouns.\n\n                                    -92-\n\fthose provided to inmates at MCI-Framingham, Massachusetts's only\n\nfemale     prison.         The      DOC's    medical         providers,     Kosilek's\n\npsychiatrist, and Kosilek herself testified as to the positive\n\nimpact these measures have had on her mental state and self-esteem.\n\n            Nonetheless,          the   district       court,   validated    by   the\n\nmajority in this appeal, has now ordered that the DOC provide\n\nKosilek with sex reassignment surgery (\"SRS\") to change her male\n\nsex organs to female.              According to the district court, this\n\nsurgery is the only adequate medical treatment for the serious risk\n\nposed by Kosilek's GID; although Kosilek is not now suicidal, a\n\nfailure to provide the surgery could result in the deterioration of\n\nher   mental     state    and     the   potential      for   future   self-harm.33\n\nConsequently, in the district court's mind, any other treatment --\n\nnamely,    the    continued        provision      of    psychotherapy,      hormonal\n\ntreatments,      and     female    attire,   in     addition     to   treating    any\n\npotential suicidality through antidepressants and increased therapy\n\n-- is violative of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n                           II. The Eighth Amendment\n\n            Fundamental to our understanding of criminal sentencing\n\nand penological standards is the requirement that \"cruel and\n\nunusual punishments [not be] inflicted\" upon those convicted of a\n\ncrime.     U.S. Const. amend. VIII.             In adopting this prohibition,\n\n\n      33\n      Kosilek has previously attempted suicide and self-castration\nwhile in custody. These attempts were made prior to 1992, while\nKosilek was awaiting trial on murder charges.\n\n                                         -93-\n\f\"Americans . . . feared the imposition of torture and other cruel\n\npunishments    not    only    by   judges   acting    beyond   their   lawful\n\nauthority, but also by legislatures engaged in making the laws by\n\nwhich judicial authority would be measured.\"           Ingraham v. Wright,\n\n430 U.S. 651, 665 (1977) (citing Weems v. United States, 217 U.S.\n\n349, 371-73 (1910)).\n\n            Later courts made apparent that the Eighth Amendment's\n\nrestrictions on criminal punishment also governed the treatment to\n\nwhich prisoners were entitled when they became sick or injured\n\nwhile in custody.     After all, where \"society takes from prisoners\n\nthe means to provide for their own needs[,] . . . [a] prison's\n\nfailure to provide sustenance [and care] for inmates may actually\n\nproduce physical 'torture or [] lingering death.'\" Brown v. Plata,\n\n131 S. Ct. 1910, 1928 (2011) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.\n\n97, 103 (1976)). The Eighth Amendment therefore proscribes medical\n\ncare that does not rise to the level of \"the evolving standards of\n\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\"              Estelle,\n\n429 U.S. at 102 (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)).\n\n            That appropriate medical care must be provided does not,\n\nhowever, mean that inmates may seek and receive the care of their\n\nchoosing.    United States v. DeCologero, 821 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).      Rather,    this    worthy   pledge   of    protection   is   made\n\npracticable through the creation of a floor below which the\n\nstandard of care must not fall.              Prison officials commit no\n\n\n                                     -94-\n\fviolation so long as the medical care provided is minimally\n\nadequate.       See id.; Leavitt v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 645 F.3d\n\n484,    497   (1st    Cir.    2011)    (stating   that   an    Eighth   Amendment\n\nviolation occurs when the medical care provided is \"so inadequate\n\nas to constitute an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain or\n\n[is] repugnant to the conscience of mankind\" (quoting Estelle, 429\n\nU.S. at 105-06)). \"[T]his obligation is met in full measure by the\n\nprovision of . . . services at a level reasonably commensurate with\n\nmodern medical science and of a quality acceptable within prudent\n\nprofessional standards.\"         DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 43.            This limit\n\non the scope of the Eighth Amendment's protection is clear: care\n\nneed not be ideal, so long as it is both diligent and within the\n\nbounds of prudence.\n\n              Neither do all instances of inadequate care constitute\n\nconstitutional violations.            To substantiate a constitutional claim\n\nthere    must    be   proof    that     the    government     was   \"deliberately\n\nindifferent\" to this lack of treatment.              See Battista v. Clarke,\n\n645 F.3d 449, 452 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. 825, 837 (1994); Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05).                  A finding of\n\ndeliberate indifference requires two showings.                First, a prisoner\n\nmust prove his or her medical need is objectively serious.                  Mahan\n\nv. Plymouth Cnty. House of Corr., 64 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).    A serious medical need is \"one that has been diagnosed by\n\na physician as mandating treatment, or one that is so objectively\n\n\n                                        -95-\n\fobvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity\n\nfor a doctor's attention.\"            Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,\n\n923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations omitted).                     Second, a\n\nprisoner must prove subjective intent to deny care on the part of\n\nprison officials.        Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837 (reasoning that the\n\nEighth Amendment's prohibition of punishment means that it reaches\n\nonly the intentional provision of inadequate medical care).\n\nTherefore, a prisoner must establish both that an official was\n\n\"aware of facts from which [an] inference [of a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm] could be drawn\" and that the official in fact drew\n\nthe   inference.   Id.         It   follows   that    a   showing     of    ordinary\n\nnegligence is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation;\n\ndeliberate indifference requires a level of obstinacy akin to\n\ncriminal recklessness.         Giroux v. Somerset Cnty., 178 F.3d 28, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           A final boundary delimiting the Eighth Amendment's scope\n\nof protection is one founded in the recognition that \"security\n\nconsiderations also matter at prisons . . . and administrators have\n\nto balance conflicting demands.\"              Battista, 645 F.3d at 454.\n\nTherefore, deference is given to the reasonable judgments of prison\n\nofficials \"so long as [those] balancing judgments are within the\n\nrealm of reason and made in good faith.\"                  Id.   Although prison\n\nofficials may \"forfeit[] the advantage of deference\" when their\n\nstated   rationales      for    the   rejection      of   medically    prescribed\n\n\n                                       -96-\n\ftreatment are pretextual, id. at 455, an assessment of deliberate\n\nindifference must still \"embrace security and administration, []\n\nnot merely medical judgments.\"         Cameron v. Tomes, 990 F.2d 14, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                        III. Clear Error Review\n\n            It is beyond argument that our standard of review in\n\ncases such as this one falls upon a continuum, ranging from clear\n\nerror for questions of pure fact, to de novo for questions of pure\n\nlaw. See, e.g., United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1158 (1st\n\nCir. 1993). Moreover, resolving Kosilek's claim certainly requires\n\nthe careful and thorough consideration of innumerable factual\n\nfindings,   including   the   weighing    and   assessment   of    expansive\n\ntestimony provided by both medical personnel and prison officials.\n\nThat this element of our task includes a grant of deference to the\n\ndistrict court is not in dispute.\n\n            Starting from this shared presumption, however, my path\n\nquickly diverges from that of the majority.          Namely, I take issue\n\nwith the majority's conclusion that all issues in this case fall\n\nsquarely    on   the   factual   end     of   our   spectrum,     and   that,\n\nconsequently, clear error review applies to all elements of the\n\ndistrict court's decision, including its ultimate conclusions.\n\nRecognizing, as the majority does, that our precedent is far from\n\ncrystallized on the matter, see ante at 63, I would not be so quick\n\nto leave such legal determinations bereft of searching appellate\n\n\n                                  -97-\n\freview.34    Neither, I believe, is that the intended result of our\n\nstandards.\n\n             At a minimum, our court should carefully apply a more\n\ncritical eye to the district court's distillation of factual\n\nfindings     into   legal   conclusions,   reviewing   those   ultimate\n\nconclusions with significantly less deference.     See, e.g., Hallett\n\nv. Morgan, 296 F.3d 732, 744 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"The district court's\n\nfactual findings regarding conditions at the Prison are reviewed\n\nfor clear error.      However, its conclusion that the facts do not\n\n\n\n     34\n      While \"no broader review is authorized . . . simply because\nthis is a constitutional case,\" see Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131,\n145 (1986), I believe that where such rights are implicated in\ncases presenting closely intertwined questions of law and fact our\ncourt would be wise to tread carefully before applying, in toto, a\nclearly erroneous standard of review. Although the Supreme Court\nhas rejected the application of a higher standard of review in\nconstitutional cases where the question at hand was one purely of\n\"historical fact,\" the Court has not expressly foreclosed\nheightened review to other questions involving \"legal, as well as\nfactual, elements.\" Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 366-67\n(1991). The majority makes much of the fact that I have previously\nexplained the existence of a circuit split -- in which the First\nCircuit has not taken a side -- regarding whether heightened review\nof underlying facts would appropriately apply in cases in which a\nright is protected below. United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80,\n96 (1st Cir. 2006) (Torruella, J., concurring).         Critically,\nhowever, I do not now sound a call for plenary review of what are\nwholly factual findings.    Cf. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of\nU.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499 (1984). Rather, I intend a more\ngeneral point, cautioning that where factual determinations and\nconstitutional standards are closely related we ought to carefully\nensure that such subordinate determinations do not erroneously cast\nthe die of our legal conclusions.        After all, our ultimate\nconclusions derive unquestionably from legally operative standards,\nand it is undoubtedly the duty of appellate courts to \"to clarify[]\n[such] legal principles.\" Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,\n697 (1996).\n\n                                  -98-\n\fdemonstrate an Eighth Amendment violation is a question of law that\n\nwe review de novo.\" (citing Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 681 (9th\n\nCir. 1994) (en banc)));35 Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 790 F.2d 1220,\n\n1225 (5th Cir. 1986) (\"[O]nce the facts are established, the issue\n\nof whether these facts constitute a violation of constitutional\n\nrights    is    a   question   of   law   that   may   be   assayed   anew   upon\n\nappeal.\").       Any deference must also admit of exception where the\n\ntrial court bases its findings on an \"erroneous interpretation of\n\nthe standard to be applied,\"         Vinick v. United States, 205 F.3d 1,\n\n7 (1st Cir. 2000) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting United States\n\nv. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 44 (1960), for even under\n\ndeferential review we have a duty to \"look carefully . . . to\n\ndetect infection from legal error,\" Sweeney v. Bd. of Trs. of Keene\n\nState Coll., 604 F.2d 106, 109 n.2.\n\n               While recognizing that the delineation between questions\n\nof law and fact is often less than pristine, see, e.g., Miller v.\n\nFenton, 474 U.S. 104, 113-14 (1985), the inherent difficulty in our\n\ntask cannot lead to the abdication of our responsibility to\n\nidentify and strenuously review a district court's conclusions of\n\nlaw, even where those conclusions are not easy to parse from their\n\n\n     35\n      The majority is correct to note that the Ninth Circuit has\nfound the question of adequate medical alternatives to be one of\nfact. Snow v. McDaniel, 681 F.3d 978, 988 (9th Cir. 2012). Yet,\nNinth Circuit practice includes plenary review of a district\ncourt's eventual Eighth Amendment holding.       Thus, I seriously\nquestion the majority's proclamation that our sister circuit \"takes\na similar approach\" to the one they now advocate.\n\n                                      -99-\n\ffactual   underpinnings.   I   cannot   agree,   therefore,   with   the\n\nmajority's failure to undertake any inquiry more searching than\n\nthat provided by clear error review.36\n\nIV. The District Court's Conclusions\n\n           In its review, the district court undertook to answer\n\nfive distinct questions which, when answered in the affirmative, it\n\nfound substantiated a constitutional violation deserving of remedy.\n\nThese were: (1) whether Kosilek had a serious medical need; (2)\n\nwhether SRS was the only adequate treatment for that need; (3)\n\nwhether the DOC knew Kosilek was at high risk of serious medical\n\nharm absent SRS; (4) whether the DOC's denial of treatment was made\n\nin bad faith or for pretextual reasons; and (5) whether the DOC's\n\nconduct, if found to be unconstitutional, would continue in the\n\nfuture.\n\n           In my view, by parsing the issue into such discrete,\n\nhermetic questions, the district court's opinion artfully shielded\n\nfrom review the complex and oft-interrelated nature of our Eighth\n\n\n\n     36\n      The majority notes that our court has previously upheld a\nfinding of deliberate indifference where the district court had a\n\"reasonable basis\" for its finding. Battista, 645 F.3d at 455.\nThat same opinion, however, made clear that a finding of deliberate\nindifference was appropriately \"reviewed on appeal more closely\nthan [] district court fact-finding.\"       Id. at 454 (citations\nomitted). While the majority admits of this subtlety, see ante at\n64, its review then appears to abdicate such nuance and apply\nmaximum deference throughout. In any case, where, as here, the\ndistrict court's determinations were infected by various errors as\ndescribed below, I believe the majority presumes too much regarding\ntheir reasonableness.\n\n                                -100-\n\fAmendment inquiry. See Leavitt, 645 F.3d at 498 (\"[T]he subjective\n\ndeliberate indifference inquiry may overlap with the objective\n\nserious medical need determination; similar evidence, including\n\nevidence of adverse effects, may be relevant to both components.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); DesRosiers v.\n\nMoran, 949 F.2d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1991) (recognizing that \"[i]n\n\npractice\" the objective and subjective components of our deliberate\n\nindifference standards \"may overlap or merge\").        In treating\n\nKosilek's contentions, therefore, I adopt our court's past practice\n\nof assessing the district court's \"several subordinate findings\" in\n\na more holistic manner.37 Battista, 645 F.3d at 452. This approach\n\ngives due recognition to the fact that \"[m]edical need' in real\n\nlife is an elastic term,\"   id. at 454, and acknowledges that any\n\ndetermination of a treatment's adequacy must carefully balance the\n\nmany competing concerns faced by prison officials.   I begin with a\n\ndiscussion of the district court's errors, as I see them.\n\nA. Prudent Medical Care\n\n          The district court faced a question about the practice of\n\nprudent medical professionals that, at its crux, hinged on whether\n\nthe DOC's preferred treatment plan -- advocated by Dr. Schmidt --\n\nwas a medically adequate response to Kosilek's GID.    Ultimately,\n\n\n     37\n      That GID is a serious medical condition is not contested.\nFurther, the fifth question need only be reached upon establishing\na constitutional violation, for the purposes of crafting a remedy.\nTherefore, I focus on only the second, third, and fourth questions\npresented.\n\n                              -101-\n\fthe district court, in a decision now upheld by the majority,\n\ndetermined that Dr. Schmidt was not a prudent professional, based\n\nlargely on his statements of equivocation regarding use of the\n\nHarry Benjamin Standards of Care (the \"Standards of Care\" or the\n\n\"Standards\").      Indeed, Dr. Schmidt testified that he viewed the\n\nStandards as \"guidelines.\"         He also made clear that he found the\n\nprotocol laid out on the Standards of Care \"very useful for\n\npatients,\" and that he \"referr[ed] [patients] to the protocol and\n\nask[ed] them to become familiar with them.\" As to SRS, Dr. Schimdt\n\nstated that he \"neither advocate[s] for nor . . . speak[s] against\n\nthe decision[].\" Instead, he \"leaves[s] the decision-making in the\n\nhands of the patients.\"         This is far from what the district court,\n\nnow   affirmed     by    the   majority,   characterizes     as   an   outright\n\nrejection of the Standards' applicability.\n\n             Still, the district court took particular issue with\n\nDr. Schmidt's practice of not writing letters of recommendation for\n\npatients   seeking      surgery.     The   district     court's   concern   was\n\npredicated    on   its    belief   that    letters    of   recommendation   are\n\nrequired by the Standards of Care, and \"[a]ccordingly, prudent\n\nprofessionals . . . write such letters.\"             Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 233.    This reasoning contains an inferential leap.            That there\n\nis a predicate requirement to a medical procedure does not lead\n\ninexorably to the conclusion that prudence mandates assisting\n\npatients to meet that requirement.             For instance, if a surgery\n\n\n                                     -102-\n\fcould not be conducted on an individual under a particular age\n\nwithout several letters of recommendation, a medical professional\n\nwho refused to write such a letter based on their understanding of\n\nthat    treatment's    appropriateness        for     youths    would   not   be,\n\nnecessarily, imprudent.\n\n            In   affirming      the    district       court's    finding      that\n\nDr. Schmidt was not prudent, the majority also assigns significant\n\nweight to the fact that, despite having treated approximately 300\n\nindividuals with GID, Dr. Schmidt does not appear to believe\n\nsurgery was ever \"medically necessary.\"               The majority disparages\n\nthis belief as clearly contrary to the Standards of Care, and\n\ntherefore clearly imprudent.          Yet, again, Dr. Schmidt admits to\n\nusing the standards for guidance and to \"maintain[ing] a neutral\n\nposition\" on surgery.        At the request of his patients, he also\n\nreleased medical files to surgeons and wrote letters indicating,\n\nwhere   appropriate,     that   there    were    no    contra-indications       to\n\nsurgery. His testimony regarding his disagreement that surgery was\n\nmedically    necessary    stemmed      from     his    belief    that   patients\n\nexhibiting particularly high levels of distress often suffer from\n\nco-morbid conditions that require treatment in their own right.\n\n            Moreover, the Standards of Care themselves admit of just\n\nthis sort of flexible application, not simply strict adherence.\n\nThe first page of the Standards of Care states unequivocally that,\n\n\"[t]he Standards of Care are Clinical Guidelines;\" it continues on\n\n\n                                      -103-\n\fto make clear that the Standards are \"intended to provide flexible\n\ndirections\"     and   that    \"[a]ll    readers   should    be   aware    of   the\n\nlimitations of knowledge in the area.\"              Standards of Care at 1\n\n(emphasis added).      But see Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d at 236 (citing\n\nO'Donnabhain v. Comm'r, 134 T.C. 34, 45 (U.S. Tax Ct. 2010))\n\n(relying on O'Donnabhain's rejection of any characterization of the\n\nStandards of Care as \"guidelines\" as imprudent). The Standards of\n\nCare further provide that \"[i]ndividual professionals and organized\n\nprograms may modify them.\"         Standards of Care at 2.       This much was\n\nmade clear in Dr. Levine's testimony:\n\n              [T]he \"Standards of Care\" was a consensus\n              document from people from seven different\n              countries or something, you know, who come\n              from different systems, and it was a political\n              process that forged together a set of\n              standards . . . . So \"prudent\" is a wonderful\n              word, but it's not like it has one simple\n              definition.\n\n              In fact, Dr. Levine, who was an independent expert hired\n\nby the district court, expressly stated in his initial report that,\n\nwhile   not     popular,     Dr.   Schmidt's   view   was    within      \"prudent\n\nprofessional standards.\"           In its opinion, however, the district\n\ncourt took significant pains to recast this finding, dismissing it\n\nas erroneous based on Dr. Levine's purported refusal to testify, at\n\nleast initially, as to how a medically prudent professional would\n\nact if all countervailing interests were set aside.                      In other\n\nwords, the court required Dr. Levine to presume that a patient had\n\nfully met all the readiness criteria in the Standards of Care and\n\n                                       -104-\n\ffaced no other extrinsic obstacles to surgery (such as money,\n\nsafety, or external pressure).   The district court then hung its\n\nhat on the fact that, \"[e]liminating these considerations and any\n\nsecurity concerns, Dr. Levine opined that a prudent professional\n\nwould not deny Kosilek sex reassignment surgery.\"   Kosilek, 889 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 235 (emphasis added).\n\n          Medical prudence, however, does not exist in a bubble,\n\nand a standard of minimal adequacy must inherently admit of\n\nconditions that are less than ideal.   See Rhodes v. Chapman, 452\n\nU.S. 337, 367 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring) (\"[C]ases are not\n\ndecided in the abstract.     A court is under the obligation to\n\nexamine the actual effect of challenged conditions . . . .\").   In\n\nfact, Dr. Levine's testimony recognizes just such nuance -- even if\n\nthe district court's reading of it does not.     Dr. Levine stated\n\nthat while prudent professionals would not deny SRS to eligible\n\nindividuals, \"life, [and] reality\" sometimes would.       In those\n\ninstances, prudent professionals \"bring to bear\" the same methods\n\ndescribed by Dr. Schmidt to otherwise alleviate the individual's\n\nsymptoms of GID.38\n\n\n     38\n      In my reading, Dr. Schmidt never counseled for denying\nsurgery. His testimony suggested deference to a patient's choice\nand willingness to release medical records to qualified surgeons.\nHe then expressed concern as to whether a prisoner could ever meet\nreadiness criteria for surgery, noting disagreement with the\ndistrict court's presumption that a real-life experience could\nnecessarily occur behind bars. Although admonishing Dr. Schmidt\nfor purportedly ignoring the Standards of Care, the district court\ndiscredited his testimony in part based on this expression of\n\n                              -105-\n\f          Nonetheless, the district court suggested that portions\n\nof Dr. Levine's testimony might be properly \"disregard[ed]\" based\n\non the purported change in his opinion.         Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 234 n.15.     I see no merit in this assertion, and moreover\n\nbelieve that it evidences the district court's troublesome practice\n\nof rejecting testimony -- even the testimony of an impartial,\n\ncourt-appointed expert -- where it explored the very real nuances\n\nimplicit in defining prudent care.           For one, the reason for any\n\nsuch \"change\" is clearly evidenced in the record: the district\n\ncourt demanded it. For another, Dr. Levine's testimony, even after\n\nhe was admonished for undertaking an assessment recognizing the\n\nrealities in which GID patients live, was not inconsistent.\n\n          He   began,   in     his   written   report,      by    stating    that\n\nDr. Schmidt's method, while not preferred, was prudent.                In later\n\ntestimony, after specifically predicating his statement with an\n\nacknowledgment   that   \"the    'Standards     of   Care'    []    have     to   be\n\ninterpreted . . . by the life of the environment in which Michelle\n\nKosilek is going to live,\" Dr. Levine again concluded that Dr.\n\nSchmidt's proposed treatment was not \"imprudent.\"                 The following\n\nexchange then occurred:\n\n\nconcern regarding whether a real-life experience -- a key component\nof those Standards -- could occur in prison. See Kosilek, 889 F.\nSupp. 2d at 235. In fact, in combination with the district court's\ninsistence that Dr. Levine ignore questions regarding this real-\nlife experience and instead presume that the experience necessarily\ncan and did occur, this suggests a purposeful tipping of the\ntestimonial scales away from an area of potentially worthy inquiry.\n\n                                     -106-\n\f             THE COURT: But is this an area in which you\n             think prudent professionals can reasonably\n             differ as to what is at least minimally\n             adequate treatment for this condition?\n             [DR. LEVINE]: Yes, and do.\n\nTherefore, in addition to finding no internal inconsistencies in\n\nDr. Levine's expert testimony, see Mitchell v. United States, 141\n\nF.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 1998), I disagree that he ever testified to\n\nDr. Schmidt's proposed method of care being outside professional\n\nstandards.      At   his   most   negative,   Dr.    Levine   stated   that\n\nDr. Schmidt's proposal would be \"uncompassionate\" and \"unpopular.\"\n\nAt his most mincing, he referred to Dr. Schmidt's proposed method\n\nof care as \"not exactly imprudent.\"39 As such, the district court's\n\nproffered conclusion that Dr. Levine found Dr. Schmidt's proposal\n\nunreasonable is unsupported by the record. Insofar as the majority\n\nnow affirms the same, erroneous reading, I find their conclusion to\n\nbe equally flawed.\n\nB. Serious Risk\n\n             It is undisputed that surgery for Kosilek would be an\n\nappropriate option for treating her GID.            This fact is far from\n\ndeterminative, however, of whether a choice not to provide the\n\nsurgery gives rise to a deprivation of constitutional magnitude.\n\nSee Cameron, 990 F.2d at 20 (finding that prison officials are not\n\n\n\n     39\n      This admittedly unenthusiastic endorsement referenced\nDr. Schmidt's proposed treatment presuming that there was a total\nabsence of countervailing factors to consider in developing a\ntreatment plan.\n\n                                   -107-\n\f\"bound to do what the doctors say is best . . . even if the doctors\n\nare unanimous\").          If an alternative short of surgery is still\n\nsufficient to address, with minimal adequacy, Kosilek's medical\n\nneed, no constitutional claim can arise.              See DeCologero, 821 F.2d\n\nat 43.\n\n               The district court reasoned, however, that any treatment\n\nexcept surgery is necessarily inadequate, given that Kosilek's\n\nmedical providers testified to a likelihood that a denial of\n\nsurgery would significantly increase Kosilek's risk of severe\n\nemotional distress, potentially manifesting in self-harm. Moreover\n\nboth the district court and majority rejected, as violative of the\n\nEighth       Amendment,   the    DOC's    plan   to   treat   any    symptoms   of\n\nheightened        distress      and   suicide    ideation     with    additional\n\npsychotherapy and the possible use of antidepressants.\n\n               This conclusion rests on an artful -- and in my mind\n\nerroneous -- compartmentalization of the DOC's preferred treatment\n\nplan.        The district court seeks to draw a clear line between the\n\ncause of Kosilek's distress (GID) and her symptoms (emotional\n\ndistress and possible suicide ideation).40             In support of the same\n\nreasoning, the majority cites a Seventh Circuit case for the\n\n\n\n        40\n       It is rare, to my understanding, that medical treatments may\nso neatly and completely delineate between symptom and disease.\nCertainly, were a patient to present with signs of both obesity and\nsevere hypertension, it is an uncommon doctor that would disparage\na peer for prescribing blood-pressure medication, although designed\nno doubt to treat a symptom.\n\n                                         -108-\n\fproposition that \"psychotherapy as well as antipsychotics and\n\nantidepressants . . . do nothing to treat the underlying disorder\n\n[of GID].\"    See Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 556 (7th Cir. 2011).\n\nCritically, however, in Fields the prisoner was denied any hormonal\n\ntreatment, meaning that the court was called on to resolve a\n\nquestion of whether psychotherapy and antidepressants alone could\n\nsufficiently treat GID. In contrast, here the question was whether\n\nthe continued provision of all ameliorative measures currently\n\nafforded Kosilek in addition to antidepressants and psychotherapy\n\nwould be constitutionally adequate.\n\n             Indeed, the DOC's proposed method of treating Kosilek's\n\ndistress and desire to self-harm cannot be assessed piecemeal, but\n\nmust be addressed in light of Kosilek's entire course of treatment.\n\nWere   surgery     not    provided,   the     provision   of     psychotherapy,\n\nhormones, electrolysis, and female clothing and cosmetics would\n\ncontinue    to    represent   a   very   real   and   direct     treatment   for\n\nKosilek's GID.      Moreover, although she remains distressed, Kosilek\n\nadmits that the DOC's current treatment regimen has led to a\n\nsignificant stabilization in her mental state.             Kosilek's doctors\n\ntestified    to    the    same,   highlighting    her     \"joy   around   being\n\nfeminized.\"       This claim is also borne out by the long passage of\n\ntime since she exhibited symptoms of suicide ideation or attempted\n\nto self-castrate.        The provision of additional, supplemental care\n\nspecifically targeting her risk of suicide cannot, in my reading,\n\n\n                                      -109-\n\frender    that   treatment,     which   has    successfully     mitigated    her\n\nsymptoms for nearly a decade, suddenly inadequate.41\n\n            What is clear from the record is that the DOC has\n\nprovided Kosilek with care sufficient to decrease her levels of\n\ndistress and manage her desires to self-harm.              On the whole, this\n\nsuggested course of treatment appears tailored to Kosilek's current\n\nsymptoms and adequately prepared to address her future ones in a\n\nmanner    that   is   in   no   way   \"so     inadequate   as   to   shock   the\n\nconscience.\" Torraco v. Maloney, 923 F.2d 231, 235 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Sires v. Berman, 834\n\nF.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1987); see also DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 43\n\n(finding that care is adequate where it is \"reasonably commensurate\n\nwith modern medical science\").\n\nC. Security Concerns\n\n            In issues of security, \"[p]rison administrators . . .\n\nshould be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and\n\n\n     41\n      The Massachusetts DOC has recently undertaken a significant\neffort to ensure it is well-prepared to address the needs of\nprisoners exhibiting symptoms of suicidality. See Disability Law\nCtr. v. Mass. Dep't of Corr., C.A. No. 07-10463-MLW, 2012 WL\n1237760 (D. Mass. Apr. 12, 2012). I see nothing to suggest such\ncare, if provided, would not itself be thorough and adequate.\nMoreover, it bears consideration that Kosilek is not currently\nsuicidal and that although her medical providers suggest a\nlikelihood that suicide ideation will reemerge if SRS is not\nprovided, there is no indication as to the severity, duration, or\neven sole causal factors of this potential result. As Dr. Levine\ntestified, the presumption that Kosilek may become suicidal must\nalso recognize the potential that this impulse is not stagnant, but\nmight naturally -- and with the assistance of therapy -- dissipate\nor \"evolve over time.\"\n\n                                      -110-\n\fexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are\n\nneeded to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain\n\ninstitutional security.\"     Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547\n\n(1979).   Although we cannot \"abdicate our responsibility to ensure\n\nthat the limits imposed by the Constitution are not ignored,\"\n\nBlackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 562 (1st Cir. 1985), we do not sit\n\nto substitute our own judgment for that of prison administrators.\n\nNonetheless, believing that the DOC's cited security concerns were\n\nmere pretext, the district court declined to afford them weight.\n\nKosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d at 247.       The majority affirmed this\n\ndenial; a decision that I believe ignores the very real security\n\nissues presented by the DOC.\n\n           That various security concerns might arise in the context\n\nof a prison setting in which a post-operative, male-to-female\n\ntranssexual is housed with male prisoners takes no great stretch of\n\nthe imagination.42   In fact, nearly every case to consider the\n\nprovision of medical care to prisoners at some point relies on the\n\nSupreme Court's 1994 decision in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825\n\n(1994).   In that case, an Eighth Amendment claim was predicated on\n\n\n\n     42\n      I find the DOC's concerns regarding Kosilek's post-operative\nhousing significant.    I do not, however, dispute the district\ncourt's finding, affirmed by the majority, that any security\nconcerns regarding Kosilek's ability to escape custody while being\ntransported for surgery are, at best, extremely minimal. Prison\nofficials have significant experience transporting prisoners, and\nboth Kosilek's age and history of good behavior counsel in favor of\nsafe transport.\n\n                               -111-\n\fprison officials' failure to provide (in part through segregation)\n\nfor the safety of a pre-operative transsexual.                       Id. at 847.     The\n\ncourt reasoned that by knowingly allowing the petitioner to remain\n\nin general custody at a male prison despite his feminine body\n\nshape,   clothing,       and    slight         stature,    prison    officials     could\n\nillustrate the sort of subjective indifference necessary to sustain\n\nan Eighth Amendment claim.               Id.\n\n              Despite the obviousness of such risks, the majority\n\nreasons that no clear error occurred, in part because the DOC's\n\nsecurity      review    of     MCI-Norfolk        was     started,    completed,    and\n\nsubmitted in a matter of weeks.                  With speed, it suggests, comes\n\ninadequacy.      I am not so ready to adopt that presumption.                       The\n\nrecord shows that all involved parties met for the first time on\n\nMay 19, 2005, to discuss a report that was due by May 27, 2005.\n\nThat this was their first meeting, however, does not necessarily\n\nmean   that    it   was      the   first       instance     in   which   the   various\n\nindividuals     considered         the    issues     and    questions    implicit    in\n\nensuring a safe environment for prisoners undergoing treatment for\n\nGID.\n\n              The district court and the majority also highlight the\n\nfact that experts retained by the DOC were not wholly knowledgeable\n\nabout Kosilek's personal characteristics, such as age and record of\n\ngood behavior.         Although this shortcoming in their knowledge was\n\nnot ideal, I cannot credit any presumption that these lapses\n\n\n                                           -112-\n\frendered the experts unable or unqualified to speak to the general\n\nsecurity concerns created by housing a post-operative transsexual\n\nin a prison's general population.               Kosilek's record of good\n\nbehavior, for instance, has no bearing on an assessment of whether\n\nother prisoners might threaten or harm her based on her post-\n\noperative anatomy and gender presentation.\n\n           Further, in reaching its conclusion the district court\n\nstated that \"the DOC [could] reasonably assure the safety of\n\nKosilek and others after sex reassignment surgery by housing\n\nKosilek in a segregated protective custody unit.\"           Kosilek, 889 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 243.           Yet, the court also warned that \"it may\n\nforeseeably be argued that keeping Kosilek in segregation is\n\nunnecessary   and    a    form    of   extrajudicial   punishment   that   is\n\nprohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\"            Id. at 245.    The tension\n\nbetween these statements is clear, and the district court's proffer\n\nthat we disregard security concerns based on the existence of a\n\npossibility for segregated housing appears unreasonable when, in\n\nshort turn, they assert that such a course of action would violate\n\nthe Constitution.\n\n           The majority defends the district court's determination\n\nin part by noting that Kosilek may continue to be housed in MCI-\n\nNorfolk's general population where no security issues have arisen\n\nduring her tenure.       The fact that no such issues have arisen in the\n\npast,   however,    does    not   necessarily    render   inappropriate    or\n\n\n                                       -113-\n\funreasonable      the   DOC's    concerns    that     issues   might   present\n\nthemselves in Kosilek's post-operative future.             Certainly, courts\n\ncannot and should not strip from prison officials the ability to\n\nconsider and implement prophylactic solutions to foreseeable issues\n\nreasonably within the scope of their security expertise.               In fact,\n\nsuch a retroactive style of administration would, in itself, seem\n\nto amount to just the sort of indifference to credible threats of\n\nharm that might constitute a constitutional violation. See Cortés-\n\nQuiñones v. Jiménez-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556, 558 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(stating that prison officials have a duty to take reasonable\n\nmeasures to protect prisoners from harm).\n\n              Ultimately,   in   a   feat   of    conclusory   reasoning,   the\n\ndistrict court overlooked the legitimacy of the DOC's concern based\n\non its belief that the decision to deny SRS was a response to\n\n\"public and political criticism.\"43              Kosilek, 889 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n240.        The evidence on record tending to support this theory\n\nincludes a press appearance by Commissioner Dennehy, negative news\n\ncoverage regarding Kosilek's request for surgery, and letters\n\nreceived by the DOC from members of the Massachusetts legislature.\n\n\n       43\n      Perhaps cognizant of the inferential leap made by the\ndistrict court, see ante at 85, the majority places greater\nemphasis on other rationales mentioned by the district court. The\ndistrict court's opinion, however, makes clear that its conclusion\nrested predominantly on concern about public opinion. Kosilek, 889\nF. Supp. 2d at 240 (\"[T]he defendant has refused to provide . . .\n[SRS] in order to avoid public and political criticism. This not\na legitimate penological purpose.      Therefore, the defendant's\nconduct . . . violates the Eighth Amendment.\").\n\n                                     -114-\n\fSurely, this evidence provides ample support for the fact that\n\npublic criticism existed and was leveled at the DOC, both by the\n\nmedia and politicians.      It in no way, however, proves the DOC's\n\nreasons for denying Kosilek's request or shows that this denial was\n\nmotivated specifically by the public outcry.\n\n            In any case, even if the district court's finding that\n\npublic criticism played a role in shaping the DOC's decision is\n\naccepted wholesale,44 this finding might at most counsel for the DOC\n\nto lose \"the advantage of deference.\"          Battista, 645 F.3d at 455\n\n(emphasis added).    It cannot, however, suddenly render superfluous\n\nthe very real concerns the DOC expressed about housing Kosilek\n\nafter her operation.       I find no license in the record for the\n\ndistrict court to have wholly dismissed the validity of these\n\nconcerns.\n\n                V. Kosilek's Eighth Amendment Claim\n\n            Having set forth my disagreements with the district\n\ncourt's conclusions regarding the scope of medical prudence, the\n\npotential for adequate treatment short of surgery, and the DOC's\n\nsecurity concerns, I turn to the task of determining whether\n\nKosilek has proven deliberate indifference to a serious medical\n\nneed.     Cameron,   990   F.2d   at   20   (\"Indeed,   when   it   comes   to\n\n\n     44\n      As the majority notes, credibility determinations of this\ntype are given particular deference by our court. See ante at 85-\n86.   Thus, while I see no extrinsic support in the record, I\nrecognize I cannot equal the district court's ability to hear and\nweigh testimony.\n\n                                   -115-\n\fconstitutional rights, none of the professionals has the last word.\n\nProfessional judgment, as the Supreme Court has explained, creates\n\nonly a 'presumption' of correctness; welcome or not, the final\n\nresponsibility belongs to the courts.\" (citing Youngberg v. Romeo,\n\n457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)).       As a starting point, this review must\n\nembrace the many competing concerns, including those relevant to\n\nprison administration, that are inherent in our constitutional\n\ninquiry,    for   there   is   \"[n]othing   in   the    Constitution      [that]\n\nmechanically gives controlling weight to one set of professional\n\njudgments.\" Id.\n\n            What is clear is that the DOC has, for several years,\n\nprovided Kosilek with significant treatment for her GID.                 Equally\n\nclear is that this treatment has resulted in marked improvement in\n\nKosilek's mental state and contentment.                She is not currently\n\nsuicidal, and all reported instances of self-harm occurred two\n\ndecades ago, long prior to her current course of treatment.                 The\n\nDOC also stands prepared to offer additional psychiatric services\n\nshould Kosilek begin exhibiting signs of suicidality. I can see no\n\nviolation on these facts.       Not performing surgery is not the most\n\ncompassionate solution to Kosilek's GID. Neither, however, does it\n\nfall outside the scope of clear professional standards, DeCologero,\n\n821 F.2d at 43, or illustrate severe obstinacy and disregard of\n\nKosilek's   medical   needs,     DesRosiers,     949    F.2d   at   19   (\"[T]he\n\n\n\n\n                                    -116-\n\fcomplainant must prove that the defendants had a culpable state of\n\nmind and intended wantonly to inflict pain.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n            Kosilek is receiving, and would continue to receive, a\n\nregimen of treatment that mitigates the severity of her GID.                This\n\ntreatment is far from the proverbial \"aspirin\" doled out to a\n\ncancer patient in lieu of chemotherapy.          See ante at 71.       Rather,\n\nthe DOC has for years ensured an individualized treatment plan for\n\nher physical and mental needs as well as consistent access to a\n\nteam of specialists.      I do not see in this treatment, nor does the\n\ndistrict court or majority make clear, any \"reasonable basis,\" see\n\nante at 66, for a finding of wanton disregard.           Giroux, 178 F.3d at\n\n32 (requiring a level of \"excessive risk\" like that of criminal\n\nrecklessness); DesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19.               Rather, giving due\n\nconsideration to countervailing security concerns and based on a\n\nreview of the record that shows the DOC's proposed care was not\n\noutside the realm of professionalism, I cannot say that the DOC has\n\nfailed to adequately care for Kosilek's GID or callously ignored\n\nher pain.    Feeney v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 464 F.3d 158, 162\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (\"The care provided must have been 'so inadequate\n\nas to shock the conscience.'\" (quoting Torraco, 923 F.2d at 235)).\n\n            Facing   litigation    that    was    equally      protracted    and\n\npassionate, the district court's task was by no means a simple one.\n\nThe   complexities   of   this    case   were    many,   and    the   testimony\n\nconsiderable.    I am convinced, however, that the district court\n\n\n                                   -117-\n\fultimately erred in several key respects, skewing its factual\n\nconclusions towards a result, now upheld by the majority, that is\n\nbeyond the boundaries of our accepted legal precedent.\n\n          The Eighth Amendment proscribes punishment, including\n\npunishment in the form of medical care so unconscionable as to fall\n\nbelow society's minimum standards of decency.       See Wilson v.\n\nSeiter, 501 U.S. 294, 300 (1991); Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102.    Its\n\nboundary simply does not reach, however, to instances of care that,\n\nalthough not ideal, illustrate neither an intent to harm nor the\n\nobstinate and unwarranted application of clearly imprudent care.\n\nRespectfully, I would reverse.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -118-\n\f",

Twenty years after prison\n\ninmate Michelle Kosilek first requested treatment for her severe\n\ngender identity disorder, the district court issued an order\n\nrequiring the defendant, Luis S. Spencer, Commissioner of the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Correction (the \"DOC\"),1 to provide\n\nKosilek with sex reassignment surgery.      The court found that the\n\nDOC's failure to provide the surgery — which was said by a group of\n\nqualified doctors to be medically necessary to treat Kosilek's\n\ncondition — violated Kosilek's Eighth Amendment rights.        The DOC\n\nappeals the district court's order.      Having carefully considered\n\nthe relevant law and the extensive factual record, we affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n    A. Gender Identity Disorder and Sex Reassignment Surgery\n\n          The   concepts   of   gender   identity   disorder   and   sex\n\nreassignment surgery sit center stage in this case and feature\n\nprominently in this opinion.    Therefore, before we go any further,\n\nwe provide a little context.     As this court has explained, gender\n\nidentity disorder is \"a psychological condition involving a strong\n\nidentification with the other gender.\"       Battista v. Clarke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217138\"><a href=\"/opinion/217138/battista-v-clarke/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450 (1st Cir. 2011).    It is a disorder recognized by the\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, which describes gender identity\n\n     1\n       For ease of reference we will speak of the defendant as the\nDOC, since the DOC's commissioner has changed multiple times during\nthe life span of Kosilek's lawsuits.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdisorder as having two components.           American Psychiatric Ass'n,\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth\n\nEdition - Text Revision 576 (2000) (\"DSM-IV-TR\").2          The first is\n\n\"evidence of a strong and persistent cross-gender identification,\n\nwhich is the desire to be, or the insistence that one is, of the\n\nother sex.\"    Id.   The second is \"evidence of persistent discomfort\n\nabout one's assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the\n\ngender role of that sex.\"        Id.\n\n             This current diagnosis of gender identity disorder grew\n\nout of an earlier diagnosis of transsexualism, which first appeared\n\nas an official disorder in the third edition of the DSM, published\n\nin 1980. Judith S. Stern & Claire V. Merkine, Brian L. v. Admin.\n\nfor   Children's     Services:    Ambivalence   Toward   Gender   Identity\n\nDisorder as a Medical Condition, 30 Women's Rts. L. Rep. 566, 567-\n\n68 (2009).    In the 1950s and 1960s, research began to show that a\n\n\"combination of psychotherapy, hormone treatment, and surgical\n\nreconfiguration of the genitalia\" could be used to treat gender\n\nidentity disorder.     Id. at 571.      This idea gained traction in the\n\n1960s and 1970s, id., and as we will discuss more fully below, this\n\n\n      2\n       DSM-IV-TR, the version applicable in Kosilek's cases, uses\nthe term gender identity disorder. A newer edition, DSM-5, was\nreleased in May 2013.    DSM-5 replaces the term gender identity\ndisorder with gender dysphoria to avoid any negative stigma. See\nAmerican      Psychiatric       Ass'n,     Gender      Dysphoria,\nhttp://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Gender%20Dysphoria%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\n(last visited Jan. 16, 2014). Because the term gender identity\ndisorder was used throughout Kosilek's cases and was the then-\nappropriate nomenclature, we will use that term.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f triadic approach is still utilized by many practitioners today.\n\nSex reassignment surgery in particular has been performed in North\n\nAmerica since at least the 1950s, and it has been estimated that as\n\nof January 2006, 30,000 sex reassignment surgeries have been\n\nperformed in the United States.    Id. at 571-72.\n\n          With this bigger picture in place, we move on to the\n\nfacts of this case.    We again note that this case has an over\n\ntwenty-year history. This has included two trials and two lengthy,\n\nfact-intensive decisions issued by the district court, the latter\n\nof which is the subject matter of this appeal.      Because of this,\n\nand because the district court's opinion was so fact-intensive, it\n\nis necessary for us to lay out a good deal of background.\n\n                      B. Kosilek's Conviction\n\n          Michelle Kosilek, née Robert, who is sixty-four years\n\nold, was born and still is anatomically male. Kosilek suffers from\n\ngender identity disorder. This has resulted in Kosilek's long-held\n\nbelief that she3 is a woman cruelly trapped in a man's body.\n\n          Kosilek, who spent some of her childhood in an orphanage,\n\nsuffered regular abuse as a child, in part because of her expressed\n\ndesire to live as a girl.     As she grew older, she alternated\n\nbetween living as a man and a woman.    Kosilek's teenage and early\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       We will refer to Kosilek as her preferred gender of female,\nusing feminine pronouns.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fadult years were marred by arrests, incarcerations, beatings, heavy\n\ndrinking, drug use, and a stint as a prostitute.\n\n          Sometime in the 1980s, Kosilek married Cheryl McCaul, a\n\nvolunteer counselor at a drug rehabilitation facility, who Kosilek\n\nmet while being treated there.          McCaul thought she could cure\n\nKosilek's gender identity disorder, but Kosilek's desire to be\n\nfemale did not go away. In 1990, Kosilek murdered McCaul. Kosilek\n\nfled the area but was ultimately apprehended in New York.\n\n          Kosilek awaited trial at the Bristol County Jail.     While\n\nthere, Kosilek, who had taken female hormones many years earlier,\n\nstarted taking female hormones (in the form of birth control pills)\n\nthat she illicitly obtained from a guard.        She also, at her own\n\nexpense, consulted with a gender identity disorder specialist,\n\nthough she was not allowed to undergo any treatment.            While\n\nawaiting trial, Kosilek twice tried to kill herself; one attempt\n\nwas made while she was taking the antidepressant Prozac.      Kosilek\n\nalso attempted self-castration.\n\n          Kosilek was eventually tried and, in 1992, was convicted\n\nof McCaul's murder and sentenced to life in prison without the\n\npossibility of parole.   She was turned over to the DOC and since\n\n1994 has been residing in the general population at MCI-Norfolk, a\n\nmedium security male prison.   There Kosilek started living, to the\n\nextent possible, as a woman, legally changing her name from Robert\n\nto Michelle.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f                            C. Kosilek's Lawsuits\n\n               In 1992, Kosilek filed a pro se complaint against the DOC\n\nin   the      United   States   District   Court    for   the   District   of\n\nMassachusetts.4        See Kosilek v. Maloney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2486110\"><a href=\"/opinion/2486110/kosilek-v-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Kosilek alleged the DOC was denying her\n\nadequate medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nKosilek sought damages and an injunction ordering that she be\n\nprovided with sex reassignment surgery.            The case was assigned to\n\nJudge Mark L. Wolf, and proceeded for some years with the parties\n\nengaging in discovery and motion practice.\n\n               Meanwhile, in December 2000, having not yet received the\n\nrelief she was seeking, Kosilek filed this case — a second pro se\n\nlawsuit against the DOC and some of its medical providers.                 See\n\nKosilek v. Spencer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Again the gravamen of Kosilek's complaint was that the DOC\n\nwas denying her adequate medical care in violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment by not providing her with sex reassignment surgery. This\n\ncase also went to Judge Wolf.\n\n               In February 2002, Kosilek's first lawsuit, Kosilek I,\n\nfinally proceeded to a non-jury trial.               Due to some pretrial\n\nskirmishing, only Kosilek's claim for injunctive relief remained\n\n(her damages claim was gone).        The trial lasted a couple of weeks.\n\n\n        4\n      Kosilek initially sued the Bristol County Sheriff, but later\namended the complaint to include the DOC after she was transferred\nto its custody.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                    D. The Kosilek I Decision\n\n          On August 28, 2002, Judge Wolf issued his decision.   See\n\nKosilek I, 221 F. Supp. 2d at 156.    The court explained that to\n\nmake out an Eighth Amendment violation, both an objective and a\n\nsubjective component must be satisfied.   In short, the objective\n\ncomponent requires that the inmate has a serious medical need that\n\nhas not been adequately treated.     The subjective piece, on the\n\nother hand, focuses on the state of mind of the prison officials\n\nand requires that they were aware the inmate was at risk for\n\nserious harm.5\n\n          The court found that Kosilek suffered from a severe form\n\nof gender identity disorder that caused her great mental anguish.\n\nIt went on to hold that this disorder was a serious medical need\n\nwithin the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.   To address the issue\n\nof what types of treatment might be warranted, the court looked to\n\nthe Harry Benjamin Standards of Care (the \"Standards of Care\"),6\n\nwhich it found to be the accepted protocols used by professionals\n\n\n     5\n       We will go into much greater depth regarding the Eighth\nAmendment standard in our own analysis, but for now it suffices to\nintroduce the concept of the two-pronged test.\n     6\n       The operative version of the Standards of Care for both\nKosilek I and Kosilek II is the Sixth Version, issued in February\n2001. See Harry Benjamin Int'l Gender Dysphoria Ass'n, Standards\nof Care for Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version (2001). The\nSeventh Version came out in 2011 under a new name.           World\nProfessional Association for Transgender Health, Standards of Care\nfor the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-\nNonconforming People, Version 7 (2011) (the \"Standards of Care,\nVersion 7\").\n\n                               -8-\n\fin the United States to treat gender identity disorder.             The\n\nStandards of Care indicated that, depending on the severity of an\n\nindividual's gender identity disorder, psychotherapy alone or\n\npsychotherapy along with the administration of female hormones\n\ncould   constitute   sufficient   treatment.     In   other   instances,\n\nhowever, sex reassignment surgery was medically necessary.          The\n\ncourt found that, despite DOC doctors recommending that Kosilek\n\nreceive female hormones and possibly surgery, the DOC, which at the\n\ntime was headed up by Commissioner Michael Maloney, had not\n\nprovided Kosilek with any of the treatment prescribed by the\n\nStandards of Care.\n\n           The court chronicled the steps taken by Maloney to avoid\n\nproviding Kosilek with treatment.       First, when an expert hired by\n\nthe DOC, Marshall Forstein, M.D., recommended psychotherapy and\n\nhormones for Kosilek, and also, that she be allowed to consult with\n\na surgeon who specialized in sex reassignment surgery, the DOC\n\nterminated its relationship with Dr. Forstein.        Maloney then made\n\nit clear to DOC doctors that he did not want to provide Kosilek or\n\nany transgender prisoner with hormones or surgery, and the DOC\n\nproceeded to find a Canadian doctor, Robert Dickey, M.D., who\n\nbelieved inmates should never be considered for sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.   Dr. Dickey advocated a \"freeze-frame\" policy whereby\n\ntransgender individuals would be frozen in the frame in which they\n\nentered prison.      For instance, only persons receiving hormones\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fbefore they were in prison would get hormones in prison.         Despite\n\nMaloney having little familiarity with the rationale behind Dr.\n\nDickey's philosophy on the treatment of gender identity disorder,\n\nand not having read the Standards of Care, Maloney adopted Dr.\n\nDickey's freeze-frame policy for the DOC.\n\n          Dr. Dickey testified at trial, but the court did not find\n\nhim persuasive because he did not subscribe to the Standards of\n\nCare, which the court found that prudent professionals follow, and\n\nhis approach did not allow for individual assessment.          The court\n\nfound Kosilek's experts credible and relied on their testimony to\n\nfind that the objective component of the Eighth Amendment had been\n\nsatisfied, namely that Kosilek had a serious medical need that had\n\nnot been adequately treated.\n\n          But   the   court   found   Kosilek   had   fallen   short   of\n\nestablishing an Eighth Amendment violation because the subjective\n\ncomponent of deliberate indifference had not been satisfied.\n\nMaloney, the court concluded, knew many facts from which he could\n\nhave inferred Kosilek would suffer serious harm if her gender\n\nidentity disorder was not treated, but he did not actually draw\n\nthat required inference.       Instead Judge Wolf found Maloney's\n\nrefusal to allow Kosilek treatment was \"rooted in sincere security\n\nconcerns, and in a fear of public and political criticism as well.\"\n\nThe end result: because there was no Eighth Amendment violation,\n\nthe court did not order the DOC to do anything.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f           Nonetheless, Judge Wolf expected it would do something.\n\nHe wrote: \"This court's decision puts Maloney on notice that\n\nKosilek has a serious medical need which is not being properly\n\ntreated.   Therefore, he has a duty to respond reasonably to it.\n\nThe court expects that he will.\"\n\n                 E. The After-Effects of Kosilek I\n\n           Following the court's dictate, lots of activity ensued at\n\nthe DOC.   First, the DOC lifted its freeze-frame policy around\n\nDecember 2002.     In its place went a policy allowing inmates\n\nsuffering from gender identity disorder to receive a level of\n\ntreatment commensurate with that which they were receiving upon\n\nentering prison (including receipt of hormones), but also providing\n\nfor increased or decreased treatment if it was determined to be\n\nmedically indicated by the University of Massachusetts Correctional\n\nHealth Program (\"UMass\"), the entity under contract with the DOC to\n\nprovide medical (including mental health) services to all inmates.\n\nPrior to the implementation of any progressive or regressive\n\ntreatment changes, the DOC's Director of Health Services and the\n\nCommissioner were required to consider whether the changes would\n\nresult in any safety or security concerns.\n\n           A couple of months later, in February 2003, the DOC\n\nbrought in a gender identity specialist, David Seil, M.D., to\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fevaluate Kosilek.7       Dr. Seil interviewed Kosilek and reviewed her\n\nmedical records, and then conveyed his findings and recommendation\n\nin writing.       Per DOC policy, which required any recommendations\n\ninvolving gender identity disorder to go to both UMass's Medical\n\nDirector and its Mental Health Program Director, the report went to\n\nKenneth Appelbaum, M.D., who held the latter position.\n\n            Dr. Seil wrote the following.           Like Drs. Forstein and\n\nDickey before him, he diagnosed Kosilek with gender identity\n\ndisorder.        He found Kosilek's \"gender dysphoria8 intense,\" and\n\nthough Kosilek had done what she could to obtain relief by living\n\nas a woman, her basic disorder had been left untreated during her\n\nincarceration. Dr. Seil, who noted that Kosilek had been living as\n\na   woman   in    a   male   prison   without   security   issues   thus   far,\n\nindicated that the Standards of Care \"need[ed] to be observed.\" He\n\nfurther found that Kosilek was not currently suicidal because she\n\nthen felt some power over her pursuit of becoming a woman.\n\n\n\n      7\n       UMass's policy was to utilize consultants in matters that\nwent beyond the expertise of its direct staff.\n      8\n       Dr. Seil, and various other medical providers involved in\nthis case, sometimes use the term gender dysphoria. As indicated\npreviously, the American Psychiatric Association now uses this term\nin place of gender identity disorder. The current version of the\nStandards of Care says gender dysphoria is \"broadly defined as\ndiscomfort or distress that is caused by a discrepancy between a\nperson's gender identity and that person's sex assigned at birth.\"\nStandards of Care, Version 7, at 2. It is not certain whether the\nmedical providers in this case were all using the term gender\ndysphoria to mean precisely the same thing but, at a minimum, it\nappears they were all using it similarly.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            Dr. Seil made several recommendations.            First, Kosilek\n\nshould     be     provided     with   estrogen     therapy,     electrolysis\n\n(specifically,      permanent    facial   hair   removal),    and   access   to\n\ngender-appropriate personal items, such as female clothing and\n\nmake-up.        Additionally, Kosilek should be allowed to see the\n\ntherapist she had been treating with, master's-level psychologist\n\nMark Burrowes, more often than once a month.           Further, feminizing\n\nprocedures, such as rhinoplasty (plastic surgery performed on the\n\nnose) or breast augmentation, should be considered in the future.\n\nFinally, Dr. Seil noted that sex reassignment surgery was the last\n\nstep in treating gender identity disorder.           He explained that, as\n\nprovided in the Standards of Care, an evaluation of the necessity\n\nof the surgery must wait until after a patient has lived as a woman\n\nfor at least a year.9        While Kosilek had been living as a woman for\n\nmany years, she had not had the benefit of hormone therapy and\n\nelectrolysis.      Therefore Dr. Seil recommended that after Kosilek\n\nhad a year of hormone treatment under her belt, an experienced\n\ngender identity specialist should evaluate her to determine whether\n\nsurgery was needed.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Dr. Seil was referring to the fact that the Standards of\nCare require that prior to receiving sex reassignment surgery, a\nperson must live full-time for one year in the preferred gender\nrole.    This requirement is commonly called the real-life\nexperience, and it is something we will discuss in more detail\nlater.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f           The DOC began implementing Dr. Seil's recommendations.\n\nIn April 2003, Kosilek started treating with an endocrinologist to\n\ndevelop a hormone therapy treatment plan.         Concomitantly, per DOC\n\npolicy, the security implications of Kosilek receiving hormones\n\nwere assessed.      On July 29, 2003, Luis Spencer, now the DOC\n\nCommissioner but then the Superintendent of MCI-Norfolk, reported\n\nto then DOC Commissioner Maloney that he did not believe there were\n\nany current security concerns with Kosilek being provided estrogen\n\ntherapy,   but   once   Kosilek   began   to   exhibit   physical   changes\n\nsecurity concerns might have to be reevaluated.\n\n           And so on August 26, 2003, Kosilek began female hormone\n\ntreatment.     Then, starting in October 2003, Kosilek was provided\n\nwith certain gender-appropriate items, such as female undergarments\n\nand make-up.     As neither Dr. Seil nor the endocrinologist Kosilek\n\nwas treating with had made specific recommendations as to whether\n\nfeminizing procedures were needed, none were provided. The DOC did\n\nfind a facility willing to provide Kosilek with electrolysis and,\n\nafter a security review of the facility was conducted, electrolysis\n\ntreatments were scheduled for November the following year.\n\n           In December 2003, Kathleen Dennehy, who had been the\n\nDOC's   Deputy    Commissioner    under    Maloney,      was   elevated   to\n\nCommissioner.     Right away she informed the staff she wanted to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f\"regroup on this GID stuff.\"10         And she wanted Kosilek reevaluated\n\nbefore approving \"laser hair removal or anything else.\"11\n\n               As of September 2004, Kosilek had been on hormones for a\n\nyear    and,    pursuant   to   the   Standards   of   Care   and   Dr.   Seil's\n\nrecommendation, was eligible to be evaluated for sex reassignment\n\nsurgery.       The issue of conducting evaluations for prisoners with\n\ngender identity disorder was taken up at executive staff meetings,\n\nattended by UMass and DOC personnel, around this time.                    Those\n\ntypically in attendance from the DOC included Susan Martin, the\n\nDOC's Director of Health Services, and Gregory Hughes, the DOC's\n\nDirector of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, as well as\n\na couple other DOC officials.           Representing UMass was its Mental\n\nHealth Program Director Dr. Appelbaum, along with some additional\n\nUMass personnel.\n\n               At one meeting, Dr. Appelbaum spoke about retaining the\n\nFenway Community Health Center (the \"Fenway Center\"), a Boston\n\nhealthcare facility focused on serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual,\n\nand transgender community. Hughes, however, had some reservations;\n\nhe felt the Fenway Center might be too sympathetic to the prisoners\n\nand too quick to recommend treatment.             Dr. Appelbaum countered,\n\nstating the Fenway Center's approach represented the norm rather\n\n\n\n       10\n            \"GID\" is an acronym for gender identity disorder.\n       11\n       It is unclear from the record what happened, if anything,\nbased on Dennehy's desires to regroup and reevaluate.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthan the exception and there really were not many other providers\n\nin the area with whom to consult.      Hughes said he had spoken with\n\na Johns Hopkins gender identity specialist, Cynthia Osborne, a\n\nlicensed social worker, who was working with the Virginia and\n\nWisconsin departments of corrections, which had also been sued by\n\ntransgender prisoners.   It was noted on the meeting minutes that\n\nOsborne \"may do more objective evaluations,\" and was \"[m]ore\n\nsympathetic to DOC position.\"\n\n          Despite Hughes's qualms about the Fenway Center and the\n\npossible option of using Osborne, the DOC went ahead with retaining\n\nthe Fenway Center.   Kosilek was evaluated by Kevin Kapila, M.D.,\n\nand Randi Kaufman, Psy.D., who conducted a ninety-minute interview\n\nwith her and reviewed her medical records.        The doctors issued\n\ntheir report with several findings on February 24, 2005 (the\n\n\"Fenway Report\").    As had been documented in the past, Kosilek\n\n\"clearly fit[]\" the diagnosis for gender identity disorder.\n\nKosilek had been on hormone therapy and living full-time as a woman\n\nfor seventeen months by that time.     Kosilek's ability to live as a\n\nwoman, her good behavior, and her absence of conflict with others,\n\nsuggested, according to the doctors, an \"intense motivation, as\n\nwell as a real adaptability to her environment.\"      They noted her\n\nfavorable response to the use of hormones, electrolysis, and use of\n\nfeminine products.    But, they noted, Kosilek was still \"quite\n\ndistressed,\" and given Kosilek's \"previous suicide attempts, her\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fongoing distress, and lack of other goals in her life,\" the doctors\n\nfound it was quite likely Kosilek would attempt suicide again if\n\nshe was not provided with sex reassignment surgery.        Kosilek had a\n\nserious medical need, they felt, and there was a substantial risk\n\nof harm if her disorder was left untreated.\n\n            The report went on to note that Kosilek had moved\n\nsuccessfully through the steps outlined in the Standards of Care,\n\nthere had not been any adverse reactions to Kosilek's feminized\n\nappearance, and Kosilek had benefitted psychologically from her\n\nchanges.    Drs. Kapila and Kaufman concluded Kosilek was likely\n\nready for sex reassignment surgery.            The surgery, the doctors\n\nopined, would provide Kosilek with full relief from the symptoms of\n\ngender    identity   disorder   and   likely   increase   her   chance   of\n\nsurvival.   The ultimate recommendation of the specialists retained\n\nby the DOC as advised by its own doctors: Kosilek should be given\n\nthe surgery.\n\n            Unhappy with the Fenway Report, the DOC turned to the\n\nJohns Hopkins gender identity specialist, Cynthia Osborne, whose\n\nname had been batted around at the earlier DOC meeting.           The DOC\n\nasked Osborne to conduct a peer review12 of the Fenway Report and\n\n\n\n\n     12\n       Peer review is the term used by the DOC — we presume because\nsocial worker Osborne was tasked primarily with reviewing the\nrecommendation of her so-called peers, the Fenway Center doctors,\nas opposed to interviewing Kosilek and conducting an independent\nassessment.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fshe agreed.   The report, along with other evaluations conducted of\n\nKosilek, were sent to Osborne on April 12, 2005.\n\n          In the meantime, on April 15, 2005, Dr. Appelbaum, who at\n\nthe time was a defendant in this lawsuit along with UMass and some\n\nother doctors, filed (at the district court's request) a status\n\nreport.   It advised the court of Drs. Kapila and Kaufman's sex\n\nreassignment surgery recommendation for Kosilek.          Dr. Appelbaum\n\nalso said he had advised the DOC of the doctors' recommendation and\n\nhad informed them he was unaware of any medical reason why Kosilek\n\nshould not receive the surgery.\n\n          The   court    responded   with   an   April   25,   2005   order\n\ndirecting the DOC to provide a report addressing potential security\n\nconcerns should Kosilek undergo the surgery.       It also directed the\n\nDOC to indicate whether it was going to provide Kosilek with the\n\nsurgery recommended by the Fenway Center doctors.\n\n          A few days later, on April 28, 2005, the DOC responded to\n\nthe UMass status report.      The letter was penned by Susan Martin\n\n(recall she was the DOC Director of Health Services) and sent to\n\nDr. Appelbaum and UMass's Medical Director, Arthur Brewer, M.D.\n\n(also a defendant).     Dennehy and other DOC officials were copied.\n\nMartin maligned Dr. Appelbaum's status report, asserting that the\n\nDOC did not consider it an adequate review of the Fenway Report or\n\na clear explanation of UMass's recommendation.           Martin requested\n\nthat the UMass doctors make clear whether they thought Kosilek\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fshould       be    operated   on.    She    also    wanted   answers   to   various\n\nquestions relating to, among other things, the surgery's logistics,\n\nsuch as who would perform it, the recovery process, and the success\n\nrate.\n\n                  Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer, in a May 10, 2005 response\n\nletter to the DOC, clarified their stance on the Fenway Report. As\n\nthey explained, UMass deferred to the Fenway Center and stood\n\nbehind the doctors' sex reassignment surgery recommendation for\n\nKosilek.          They were aware of no mental health barriers to Kosilek\n\nbeing operated on and the next step was finding a surgeon.                      It\n\nappeared there were no physicians in Massachusetts who could\n\nperform       the    surgery,   so   some    out-of-state    practitioners     were\n\nsuggested.          The doctors also offered to look into the logistics of\n\nproviding the surgery.\n\n                  In the interim, Osborne completed her review of the\n\nFenway Report.13         She chronicled her findings in a report dated May\n\n20, 2005, which she sent to the DOC.               It began with the caveat that\n\nOsborne had not conducted a clinical evaluation of Kosilek and her\n\nreport was based solely on her review of the Fenway Report and some\n\nof the other evaluations of Kosilek.                  Though she did not doubt\n\n\n\n        13\n         We pause to say a little more about Osborne's\nqualifications. According to her C.V., at least as of 2006, she\nheld a master's degree in education and social work. Osborne was\nalso an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine and on the consulting faculty of the\nUniversity's Center for Sexual Health and Medicine.\n\n                                           -19-\n\fKosilek met the criteria for gender identity disorder, Osborne went\n\non to lodge numerous criticisms against Drs. Kapila and Kaufman's\n\napproach.\n\n            First, Osborne disparaged the Fenway Report for not\n\naddressing the issue of whether Kosilek was suffering from any\n\npersonality disorders.         She opined that \"[c]larity regarding the\n\npresence,   absence,     nature    and    severity\"      of    any      personality\n\ndisorder,   especially    given    that     clinicians    had      at    one   point\n\ndiagnosed   Kosilek     with    antisocial     personality         disorder,    was\n\ncritical because its presence could complicate a gender identity\n\ndisorder diagnosis.      Osborne also argued that threats of suicide\n\nand self-harm signal serious mental illness apart from gender\n\nidentity disorder, which demands treatment and, in fact, counsels\n\nagainst providing sex reassignment surgery. She thought the Fenway\n\nReport had given short shrift to this issue.\n\n            Osborne then turned her focus to the Standards of Care,\n\nexpressing her concerns that they did not translate well into a\n\nprison environment.     She wrote: \"In my view, providing surgery, or\n\neven   hormones,   to   incarcerated      individuals,        is   an   undeniable\n\nlowering of the Standards, and an explicit violation of the\n\ncriteria regarding sociopathy and suicidality.\"                    While Osborne\n\nrecognized the Standards of Care as helpful, she noted they had no\n\nregulatory authority.      Also, there was no universal consensus in\n\nthe psychiatric community about what constituted medical necessity\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fin the treatment of gender identity disorder.         She criticized the\n\nFenway Report for failing to address other possible treatment\n\noptions for Kosilek or to provide an adequate explanation for its\n\nsurgery   recommendation.       Kosilek,   in   Osborne's    eyes,   had   an\n\nunrealistic expectation that she was owed certain treatments and\n\nKosilek would instead benefit from a thorough assessment for\n\npsychiatric disorders and treatment designed to address any such\n\ndisorders along with her gender identity disorder.\n\n              On May 25, 2005, the back and forth between the DOC and\n\nUMass continued.        Martin sent Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer another\n\ncriticism-laced letter. While the doctors had answered some of the\n\nDOC's questions, they had not provided a comprehensive review of\n\nthe appropriateness or necessity of surgery for Kosilek.             Citing\n\nthe   DOC's    Eighth   Amendment   obligations,   Martin    lamented   that\n\nneither UMass nor the Fenway Report had offered guidance on whether\n\nsurgery was \"a medical necessity for Kosilek.\"              Finally, Martin\n\ninformed them of the DOC's engagement of Osborne to review the\n\nFenway Report and enclosed a copy of Osborne's report.               Martin\n\nasked UMass to review the report and give the DOC its ultimate\n\nrecommendation as to the appropriateness of surgery for Kosilek.\n\n              The same day Martin fired off her letter, a news piece,\n\nwhich was highly negative toward Kosilek and her quest for surgery,\n\nappeared on a local television station.         Commissioner Dennehy had\n\nbeen interviewed for the piece on May 16, and one of her comments\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fmade it on air.14     A Massachusetts state senator, who had filed\n\nlegislation seeking to prohibit the state from paying for sex\n\nreassignment surgery for inmates, also spoke to the reporter.\n\n\"When you go to prison you lose some rights.         You also lose your\n\nrights to get a sex change operation,\" he stated. The senator, who\n\nwas an acquaintance of Dennehy, had called Dennehy on her cell\n\nphone to advise her that he would be participating in the news\n\npiece.    The piece concluded with the reporter indicating: \"Later\n\nthis week, the state will tell the federal court that sex surgery\n\nfor Michelle Kosilek would result in a security nightmare.\"15\n\n           Despite the security concerns the DOC expressed to the\n\nmedia, Dennehy and her staff had yet (as of the time she was\n\ninterviewed)   to   officially   convene   to   conduct   their   internal\n\nsecurity review. Not until May 19, three days after her interview,\n\ndid they actually meet.    In attendance were Dennehy, DOC counsel,\n\nSuperintendent Spencer of MCI-Norfolk, and Superintendent Lynne\n\nBissonnette of MCI-Framingham, the women's prison where Kosilek\n\nmight be sent were she to undergo surgery.         Dennehy did not have\n\nthe benefit of written reports from Spencer or Bissonnette, despite\n\n\n\n     14\n       She was quoted: \"The courts are telling us that medical\nprofessionals make medical recommendations and correctional\nadministrators assess the safety and security concerns.\"\n     15\n       It seems likely that the reporter learned this information\nfrom Dennehy herself, though it is unclear whether it could have\ncome from someone on her staff.     Either way the DOC does not\ndispute that this tidbit came from within the DOC.\n\n                                  -22-\n\fDOC   policy   calling    for   the   superintendents    to   make   such\n\nrecommendations, because (as Dennehy later testified) the security\n\nconcerns seemed self-evident.\n\n          On June 10, 2005, the DOC brought the court back into the\n\nloop, finally filing the status report which the court had ordered\n\nback on April 25.    The DOC informed Judge Wolf it had decided not\n\nto provide Kosilek with sex reassignment surgery.         In support of\n\nits decision, the DOC attached Osborne's report.        It also attached\n\nthe court-ordered security report, which was principally authored\n\nby DOC attorneys with input from Dennehy.\n\n          The security report, which said it was based on Dennehy's\n\nthirty years of correctional knowledge and experience, as well as\n\nthe experience of colleagues she had spoken with, stated the\n\nfollowing.     Allowing the surgery to go forward \"would create\n\nsubstantial safety and security problems for DOC.\"            She claimed\n\nthat out-of-state surgery, which appeared to be the only option\n\nbased on a dearth of doctors in Massachusetts, would cause \"complex\n\nsecurity and logistical issues\" and might give Kosilek a chance to\n\nescape custody.     Kosilek's post-surgery confinement was also a\n\ncause for concern.       Dennehy argued Kosilek would be at risk for\n\nsexual assault if she were to remain in a male prison, and housing\n\nher in a female prison would come with its own host of problems.\n\nSpecifically, Dennehy anticipated \"serious climate issues\" since\n\nthe majority of the women at MCI-Framingham had histories of trauma\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fand it was well known that Kosilek had killed her wife.            The women\n\nmight pose a threat to Kosilek and vice versa.         Kosilek would need\n\nto be isolated and restrictively confined in either prison and\n\nthis, Dennehy concluded, might be deleterious to Kosilek's mental\n\nhealth. Citing these concerns, along with what she perceived as an\n\nunclear stance from UMass on whether surgery was necessary,16 and\n\ngiven Osborne's critiques of the Fenway Report, Dennehy indicated\n\nthat the DOC was denying Kosilek's request for surgery.\n\n           After the status report was filed with the court, the DOC\n\nand UMass continued to clash over what the DOC perceived to be\n\nUMass's equivocations.     Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer directed a June\n\n14, 2005 letter at the DOC.      Calling the DOC's statements in its\n\nprevious letters and status report \"disingenuous,\" the doctors\n\nemphasized that it was not within their purview to decide whether\n\nsurgery   is   medically   necessary   for   Kosilek   as   that    term   is\n\ncontemplated by the Eighth Amendment.        UMass, they explained, had\n\nconsistently relied on the expertise of outside consultants, all of\n\nwhom had said the same thing.      The doctors again underlined that\n\nsolely from a clinical perspective it appeared that Kosilek should\n\nbe offered surgery.\n\n\n\n     16\n       The report quoted the supposedly ambiguous language from\nUMass's letter: \"the treatment recommended in the Fenway\nreport . . . appears to be reasonable and appropriate, since the\npatient has met criteria for the diagnosis of gender identity\ndisorder and has reached a point in clinical treatment where sexual\nreassignment surgery, if desired, would be the next step.\"\n\n                                  -24-\n\f           On October 7, 2005, Drs. Kapila and Kaufman prepared and\n\nissued another report, this one a response to Osborne's critiques\n\nof their Fenway Report, which they sent to UMass and which UMass\n\npassed on to the DOC.      Citing medical literature and studies, the\n\ndoctors took aim at Osborne's criticisms, explaining why her\n\nchallenges to their recommendation for surgery were clinically\n\nunfounded or irrelevant.        The report also argued that Kosilek was\n\nstable, not currently suicidal, and a good candidate for surgery.\n\nThe doctors strenuously insisted that their recommendation of\n\nsurgery was an informed clinical judgment rooted in Kosilek's\n\ngender   identity    disorder    diagnosis,    her   marked   mental   health\n\nimprovement since being provided hormones and being allowed to live\n\nas a woman, and the well-documented effectiveness of surgery.            The\n\ndoctors reiterated their recommendation that Kosilek be provided\n\nwith the surgery.      Dr. Appelbaum submitted this report to the DOC\n\non October 17, 2005, restating UMass's endorsement of the original\n\nFenway Report's recommendations and requesting that the DOC issue\n\na decision approving those recommendations.\n\n           As to the status of Kosilek's lawsuit, as of July 2005,\n\nKosilek had let all the medical provider defendants (Drs. Appelbaum\n\nand Brewer, and UMass, among others) out of the case.             That same\n\nmonth she filed an amended complaint, this time with the benefit of\n\nan attorney, with Dennehy as the sole named defendant.           Kosilek no\n\nlonger   sought     damages,    she   only   requested   injunctive    relief\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\frequiring the DOC to provide her with adequate medical care,\n\nincluding sex reassignment surgery.           The case went to trial a\n\nlittle less than a year later.\n\n                         F. The Kosilek II Trial\n\n                        1. Round One of Testimony\n\n          The non-jury trial, which like Kosilek I was presided\n\nover by Judge Wolf (by then Chief Judge), began on May 30, 2006.\n\nTestimony initially went until the end of June, with multiple\n\nwitnesses testifying.17\n\n          First   the    court    heard    from   George   Brown,   M.D.,   a\n\npracticing psychiatrist who helped author the Standards of Care,\n\nand who testified as an expert on Kosilek's behalf (he also\n\ntestified in Kosilek I).      As he had done back in 2001, Dr. Brown\n\nevaluated Kosilek and reviewed her medical records.          He prepared a\n\nwritten report, and in it diagnosed Kosilek with chronic and severe\n\ngender identity disorder.        He did not think she met the criteria\n\nfor antisocial personality disorder.        Dr. Brown also did not think\n\nKosilek was trying to game the system, writing that he was \"hard\n\npressed to develop a rational explanation for why someone would\n\nwork so fervently to obtain this serious, painful surgery\" other\n\nthan as a means to treat gender identity disorder.          Dr. Brown also\n\nopined that Kosilek had met or exceeded the readiness criteria for\n\n\n     17\n       We summarize the testimony in the order it was given, save\nfor Dr. Schmidt. He actually testified before Kosilek finished\nputting on her witnesses (we assume for scheduling convenience).\n\n                                    -26-\n\fsex reassignment surgery.       Among other things, she had completed a\n\nmore than two-year monitored, real-life experience living as a\n\nwoman while incarcerated. Further, he wrote, Kosilek had \"received\n\nan unambiguous diagnosis of severe gender identity disorder from no\n\nfewer than nine mental health professionals who have interviewed\n\nher, many of whom are recognized international experts in the field\n\nof gender identity disorder.\"         Dr. Brown stressed, \"[n]o further\n\ntreatment or real-life experience is necessary,\" and Kosilek should\n\nreceive the surgery, which Dr. Brown deemed \"medically necessary.\"\n\n           Hammering the point home, Dr. Brown testified, consistent\n\nwith his written report, that the hormones and psychotherapy\n\nKosilek   was    receiving,     though   they   had    helped    relieve    her\n\ndysphoria, were \"[a]bsolutely not\" sufficient to eliminate the\n\nserious risk of harm Kosilek faced, up to and including suicide.\n\nWhen   asked    whether   sex    reassignment    surgery      was   medically\n\nnecessary, Dr. Brown stated: \"Absolutely.            If I can walk away from\n\nthese proceedings with one point being clear in people's minds,\n\nit's that.\"     Without surgery, he added, \"the degree of likelihood\n\nof [Kosilek] suffering serious medical consequences up to and\n\nincluding suicide are exceedingly high.\"         As for antidepressants,\n\nthey are for the treatment of patients with major depressive\n\ndisorder, which Dr. Brown stressed Kosilek did not have.                   With\n\nregards   to     gender   identity       disorder,     such     antidepressant\n\nmedications had been shown to be \"very ineffective\" as they might\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fonly slightly relieve some depressive symptoms but would not treat\n\nthe underlying gender identity disorder.             Only surgery, Dr. Brown\n\ntestified,   had   the      \"significant     potential\"   to   cure   Kosilek's\n\nmedical condition.\n\n           Next came Dr. Kenneth Appelbaum's testimony.               The Fenway\n\nCenter doctors, he said, had significant experience in the area of\n\ngender identity disorder and were well-trained, credentialed, and\n\nknowledgeable.         He   thought   their      assessments   were   typically\n\nreasonable and consistent with the approaches followed by most\n\nother medical providers. In general, Dr. Appelbaum did not see why\n\nthe DOC would need to consult with Osborne (an out-of-state,\n\nmaster's-level social worker) given that it had already received\n\nthe recommendations of the Fenway Center doctors (a local physician\n\nand doctoral psychologist), who were, in Dr. Appelbaum's mind,\n\nhighly experienced in dealing with gender identity disorder.                 As\n\nfor Osborne, Dr. Appelbaum recalled that the DOC's Hughes had\n\ncommented that she would be more sensitive to the DOC's concerns\n\nbecause   she    did    not    believe     sex    reassignment   surgery    was\n\nappropriate in the corrections setting.               Finally, Dr. Appelbaum\n\ntestified that from his conversations with Kosilek's treatment team\n\nat the prison, it was his understanding Kosilek had shown good\n\nadjustment being on hormones and receiving therapy.\n\n           Dr. Randi Kaufman from the Fenway Center then took the\n\nstand.    She reiterated the conclusion she made in her report, in\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fparticular that Kosilek had successfully completed the real-life\n\nexperience contemplated by the Standards of Care.         She also\n\ntestified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, there\n\nwas a \"very high likelihood\" Kosilek would attempt suicide if\n\ndenied treatment for her gender identity disorder.   Though Kosilek\n\nbenefitted from being on hormones, Dr. Kaufman felt Kosilek had a\n\nlevel of gender identity disorder that could not be treated with\n\nanything less than surgery. \"She's done all the things that people\n\ndo to change their gender presentation,\" she said, and \"[t]here\n\nreally isn't anything left except for surgery.\"      Kosilek had a\n\nmedical need for the surgery.\n\n          Mark Burrowes, a licensed mental health counselor with a\n\nmaster's degree in counseling psychology, who had been treating\n\nKosilek for four or five years, also testified.        Kosilek, he\n\nagreed, was ready for sex reassignment surgery.      Not having the\n\nsurgery would be detrimental and could result in Kosilek making an\n\nattempt on her life.   Suicide monitoring would not be an adequate\n\nalternative to surgery since Kosilek's male genitalia still caused\n\nher distress.\n\n          Finally, Michelle Kosilek was called by her attorneys.\n\nShe spoke about her life at MCI-Norfolk.   Generally she got along\n\nquite well with most of the people there, though a small percentage\n\nof the correction officers gave her a hard time.       Kosilek had,\n\nsince she got to prison, worked on a daily basis.     She testified\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fthat the hormone treatments had made her a little less depressed\n\nbut she continued to feel distress over her body.     Kosilek, who\n\nsaid she was not currently suicidal, felt the hormones were not\n\nenough and she needed surgery. She did not want to continue living\n\nwith her male genitalia and, if denied surgery, antidepressants and\n\npsychotherapy would not help matters.\n\n          The DOC then put on its case.    First, Chester Schmidt,\n\nM.D., a psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and\n\nassociate director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Sexual Health\n\nand Medicine, testified as an expert for the DOC.        He became\n\ninvolved in this case through his connection with Cynthia Osborne.\n\nAs to his general approach for treating patients with gender\n\nidentity disorder, Dr. Schmidt stated he does utilize the Standards\n\nof Care but thinks of them more as protocols or guidelines, as\n\nopposed to actual standards of care.    He does not agree with the\n\nidea, set forth in the Standards of Care, that sex reassignment\n\nsurgery is medically necessary in patients with severe gender\n\nidentity disorder. In fact, Dr. Schmidt did not recall ever seeing\n\na case where he thought surgery was medically necessary.    It was\n\nhis and his Johns Hopkins colleagues' practice to neither advocate\n\nnor speak against a patient's desire for surgery, but to leave it\n\nin the hands of the patient.      He would not send a letter of\n\nrecommendation to a surgeon on behalf of a patient, but he would\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\frelease his file to the surgeon and simply indicate he saw no\n\ncontraindications to surgery.\n\n              After giving his general overview, Dr. Schmidt turned his\n\nfocus to Kosilek, whom he had personally evaluated in November\n\n2005.    Kosilek did meet the criteria for gender identity disorder,\n\nhe concluded.      However, Dr. Schmidt did not believe surgery was\n\nmedically      necessary   as   Kosilek,    he    theorized,      had       made   an\n\n\"excellent adaptation\" without surgery thus far.             He also felt the\n\nreal-life experience contemplated in the Standards of Care was\n\nvirtually impossible to replicate in prison.                But besides this\n\nbarrier, Dr. Schmidt admitted he did not see any contraindications\n\nto surgery. Should Kosilek become depressed if she did not receive\n\nthe    surgery,   Dr.   Schmidt   thought   she    could    be    treated      with\n\nantidepressants      and   psychotherapy,    and    managed      in     a    medical\n\nfacility should her suicidal desires become severe.                   This latter\n\nscenario was a possibility, as Dr. Schmidt recognized Kosilek's\n\nrisk of suicide based on what she had said and done in the past.\n\nBut,    Dr.   Schmidt   opined,   psychotherapy     and    medications         could\n\neffectively reduce Kosilek's dysphoria to a level where she was no\n\nlonger at risk for serious harm.\n\n              Next Cynthia Osborne, the Johns Hopkins social worker and\n\nDOC consultant, gave testimony echoing Dr. Schmidt. By the time of\n\ntrial, she had met with and interviewed Kosilek.                 Osborne agreed\n\nwith Kosilek's severe gender identity disorder diagnosis.                      Yet,\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\flike Dr. Schmidt, in general, she did not believe the real-life\n\nexperience called for by the Standards of Care could happen in a\n\nprison environment.   Also, Kosilek was not, in her opinion, a good\n\ncandidate for sex reassignment surgery, nor was it medically\n\nnecessary, because Kosilek had responded very well to hormone\n\ntreatment. Rather, Osborne thought support groups or group therapy\n\ncould be used to treat Kosilek effectively.   Kosilek's threats of\n\nsuicide if denied surgery did not change Osborne's mind on what\n\ntreatment was warranted.    Indeed, she minimized concerns about\n\nsuicide by noting that any good mental health system would know how\n\nto deal with a patient's suicidality.     Osborne, again like Dr.\n\nSchmidt, did not fully agree with the Standards of Care's statement\n\nthat sex reassignment surgery is medically necessary in cases of\n\nsevere gender identity disorder.\n\n          Luis Spencer, then still Superintendent of MCI-Norfolk,\n\nalso testified for the DOC.      He explained the set-up at MCI-\n\nNorfolk, describing it as having one of the more secure perimeters\n\nin Massachusetts.     It is surrounded by walls on all sides, an\n\nelectrified fence, and guard towers which are manned twenty-four\n\nhours a day, seven days a week.    Approximately one-third of the\n\ninmates at MCI-Norfolk, Spencer explained, are serving a life\n\nsentence and one-third have committed sexual felonies.\n\n          Spencer also testified about Kosilek.   She had adjusted\n\nfairly well to life at MCI-Norfolk and had not reported any threats\n\n\n                               -32-\n\for harassment from other inmates.              As of the time of trial, no\n\nsecurity concerns involving Kosilek had arisen; however, Spencer\n\nhad some apprehension going forward should Kosilek receive the\n\nsurgery.     He would have \"grave concerns\" putting Kosilek back in\n\nthe general population with the full anatomy of a female.              Spencer\n\nworried that she could be raped or assaulted and he saw no\n\nalternative     but   to   house   her    in    the   high-security    Special\n\nManagement Unit.      This unit was a standalone secure building where\n\nKosilek would remain in her cell twenty-three hours a day and could\n\nonly   leave   when   shackled     and   escorted     by   two   guards.     The\n\nquestioning also briefly touched on Kosilek's threats of suicide\n\nwere she not to receive the surgery.             Spencer said his policy is\n\nnot to negotiate with inmates who threaten suicide, as to do so\n\nwould undermine his and the staff's authority.               Rather, he would\n\nimplement the DOC's mental health policy and take the appropriate\n\nsteps to guard a suicidal inmate's safety.\n\n             Gregory Hughes, who was the DOC's Director of Mental\n\nHealth and Substance Abuse Services until 2005, and who holds a\n\nmaster's degree in social work, was questioned next.                       Hughes\n\ntestified about the aftermath of Kosilek I and the DOC's efforts to\n\ncomply with the court's decision. His role included overseeing and\n\nfacilitating the services supplied to Kosilek, and in particular\n\nmaking happen the independent evaluation Judge Wolf ordered in\n\nKosilek I.     He testified about his dissatisfaction with the Fenway\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fReport, questioning its thoroughness and its heavy reliance on\n\nKosilek's self-reporting.      He was concerned that the doctors had\n\nnot reviewed any of Kosilek's medical records or mental health\n\nhistory or interviewed other people to verify Kosilek's self-\n\nreports.    And while Hughes knew the doctors suggested surgery, he\n\nsaid   he    was   uncertain    about    whether   there   were   other\n\nrecommendations and what next step the DOC should take. Because he\n\nwas concerned with the Fenway Report's quality, Hughes had decided\n\nto contact Osborne.     Hughes also testified that he reported his\n\nconcerns about the report to Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer and that the\n\nDOC sought their thoughts during staff meetings.       Hughes recalled\n\nthe doctors saying there were no contraindications to surgery but\n\ndid not believe they used the term \"medically necessary.\"\n\n            Robert Dumond, who was the Director of the DOC's Research\n\nand Planning Division, and who had previously provided mental\n\nhealth screenings at MCI-Framingham, testified on the DOC's behalf.\n\nDumond, who had a master's degree in psychology and experience in\n\nthe areas of victimization and sexual assault in the prison system,\n\nwas asked by the DOC to consider the risk factors for post-\n\noperative individuals in prison. Placing Kosilek at MCI-Framingham\n\npost-surgery, he responded, could \"destabilize[] the safety and\n\nsecurity of the institution\" and create a risk for Kosilek to\n\nbecome a victim or victimizer.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\f              Arthur Beeler was also called by the DOC to testify about\n\nsecurity issues.        Beeler, a thirty-year employee with the Federal\n\nBureau of Prisons, was warden at the Federal Correction Complex,\n\nFederal Medical Center in Buckner, North Carolina.                  Beeler toured\n\nMCI-Norfolk and MCI-Framingham, spoke with Superintendent Spencer,\n\nand reviewed the DOC's mental health policies in preparation for\n\nhis testimony.         In his opinion, Kosilek was currently safe and\n\nsecure   at    MCI-Norfolk,    based    in    part    on    the    set-up    of    the\n\nfacilities and her cell and the fact that Kosilek had never been\n\nassaulted     there.      Beeler     indicated   that       he    \"would    be    very\n\nconcerned\" about placing Kosilek in the women's general population\n\nat   MCI-Framingham      and   was   satisfied       that   the    mental    health\n\nprocedure at MCI-Norfolk was sufficient to address inmate suicide\n\nideation and behavior.         Beeler cautioned against giving in to an\n\ninmate's threats of suicide, likening it to opening Pandora's box.\n\nBeeler was not permitted to testify specifically about whether\n\nsecurity concerns should preclude Kosilek from getting surgery\n\nbecause, the court found, he was not sufficiently informed about\n\n\"the facts concerning Kosilek\" because Beeler had not looked at her\n\ndisciplinary or medical records.\n\n              Susan Martin, the DOC's Director of Health Services\n\nduring the relevant time period, was next up.               After speaking some\n\nabout the contractual relationship between the DOC and UMass,\n\nMartin turned to the Fenway Center's evaluation of Kosilek.                       Like\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\fHughes, she was not satisfied with the evaluation.   Martin did not\n\nthink the Fenway Report was very thorough and she raised this\n\nconcern to UMass at the time. Though Martin knew the Fenway Center\n\ndoctors were recommending surgery, she did not think they were\n\nclear enough about what exactly needed to happen and when. Because\n\nof these perceived omissions, Martin decided to have Osborne review\n\nthe report.\n\n          When asked about UMass's role, Martin indicated she\n\nthought it was UMass's job to determine whether the Fenway Center's\n\nrecommendations \"were medically necessary and clinically sound,\"\n\nand UMass, she said, would not do this.   She considered it UMass's\n\nresponsibility to find a surgeon, and simply providing the DOC with\n\na list of possible surgeons was not sufficient.\n\n          Next came DOC Commissioner Kathleen Dennehy's testimony.\n\nIf faced with a court order compelling the DOC to provide Kosilek\n\nwith sex reassignment surgery, Dennehy said she would probably\n\nretire before implementing something she considered unsafe.    And\n\nbased \"strictly [on] safety and security concerns\" she said she\n\nwould still veto the surgery even if UMass told her it was\n\nmedically necessary and even if Kosilek would likely attempt\n\nsuicide if denied the surgery.    (Dennehy claimed she was still\n\nawaiting clear direction from UMass.)\n\n          When asked, Dennehy acknowledged her awareness of the\n\nnegative public attention that Kosilek's bid had been receiving.\n\n\n                               -36-\n\fShe admitted she knew that a Massachusetts senator, who she was\n\nfriendly with and who had spoken in the news piece, vocally opposed\n\nsex   reassignment    surgery    for    inmates    and   was     pushing    for\n\nlegislation to put a stop to its provision.         She also said she knew\n\nof the Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor's opposition to surgery\n\nfor transgender inmates.\n\n          Finally,     Lynne    Bissonnette,      Superintendent     of     MCI-\n\nFramingham, was called upon to discuss the feasibility of Kosilek's\n\npost-operative placement there.        She explained the set-up at MCI-\n\nFramingham.   The women lived in multi-person rooms or dormitory-\n\nstyle housing units, with the exception of the women in the\n\nsegregation or medical units who had single cells.               For the most\n\npart the buildings at MCI-Framingham were surrounded by a single,\n\nnon-electrified      twelve-foot-high     fence.         There    had      been,\n\nBissonnette indicated, no prisoner escapes during her three-year\n\ntenure at Framingham.\n\n          As for the population at the facility, according to\n\nBissonnette, a large majority of the women there had been victims\n\nof domestic violence or sexual assault.             Also, a majority had\n\nmental health issues with about a half receiving medication for\n\nthose issues.     Bissonnette stated that if a woman could not\n\neffectively be maintained by the mental health professionals at the\n\nprison, she was sent for inpatient treatment at a Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Mental Health facility, where security was not the\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fequivalent of what was provided at the prison.                   And whereas\n\nMassachusetts      provides   a   special    secure       hospital    for   male\n\nprisoners,      Bridgewater   State   Hospital,     she   explained     that   no\n\ncomparative facility exists for women.\n\n              Bissonnette's    testimony     then     turned     to      Kosilek\n\nspecifically, whose criminal record she had reviewed.                Bissonnette\n\ndid not think Kosilek was an appropriate candidate to be housed at\n\nMCI-Framingham post-operatively and noted several concerns. First,\n\nBissonnette considered Kosilek a flight risk based on the weak\n\nperimeter at MCI-Framingham, the length of Kosilek's sentence, and\n\nthe fact that Kosilek had fled Massachusetts after killing her\n\nwife.18      Second, Bissonnette worried about the lack of available\n\ninpatient mental health care.         Kosilek would have to be sent to a\n\nless secure hospital for the general public should she require\n\ncare.        Third, Bissonnette considered Kosilek both a potential\n\npredator and victim within the inmate population — a predator\n\nbecause Kosilek had strangled her wife and a victim because a large\n\nproportion of MCI-Framingham's population had been the victims of\n\ndomestic violence and sexual abuse and might seek to harm her.\n\nFurther, and for essentially those same reasons, Bissonnette felt\n\nKosilek would have a negative effect on the prison population.\n\n\n\n\n        18\n       Bissonnette considered Kosilek's earlier flight, even though\nthe DOC classification manual says pre-custodial flight should not\nbe considered when classifying inmates.\n\n                                      -38-\n\f            In light of all of these concerns, were Bissonnette\n\nrequired to house Kosilek, she would put her in the Close Custody\n\nUnit, the single cell segregation unit, where inmates cannot hold\n\nany employment and are placed in restraints whenever they leave the\n\ncell.     Since Kosilek is serving a life sentence, Bissonnette\n\nexpressed    concern   that   housing    her   in   an    environment   this\n\nrestrictive for such an extended period of time would have a\n\nnegative impact on Kosilek's mental health.\n\n            On cross-examination Bissonnette made a few concessions.\n\nShe agreed that MCI-Framingham currently houses approximately forty\n\noffenders who are serving life sentences for murder.           Further, the\n\ninstitution houses in the general population inmates who are\n\nconvicted of heinous crimes against children alongside prisoners\n\nwho are mothers.       Bissonnette explained that if inmates are\n\nperceived to experience trauma based on the presence of other\n\ninmates, there are policies and procedures in place to follow (such\n\nas simply ordering a cell transfer) and the mental health and\n\nsecurity staff would respond appropriately.              Though Bissonnette\n\nagain acknowledged Kosilek could be housed in the Close Custody\n\nUnit safely, she persisted that this was not the \"best setting for\n\nany inmate over a long period of time.\"19\n\n\n     19\n       During the first round of testimony some more negative press\ncame out. The Boston Globe ran an editorial on June 15, 2006,\nwhich took the position that Kosilek should not receive the\nsurgery. The editorial referred to the \"distastefulness of a wife\nkiller angling to serve out his sentence of life without parole in\n\n                                  -39-\n\f             2. Responses to the First Round of Testimony\n\n             After the first bout of testimony, which concluded at the\n\nend of June 2006, Judge Wolf then directed the UMass doctors to\n\nreview Dr. Schmidt's testimony and to inform the court whether the\n\nlatter's     proposed     approach    was     within    prudent    professional\n\nstandards.     Drs. Appelbaum and Brewer responded in a report filed\n\nwith the court on September 18, 2006.             They continued to endorse\n\nthe Fenway Center doctors' conclusion that Kosilek had a serious\n\nmedical need requiring surgery.             In their opinion, Dr. Schmidt's\n\nproposed alternative course of psychotherapy, medication, and\n\nsuicide watch fell \"outside the bounds of acceptable professional\n\nstandards\" and would not constitute \"adequate medical care.\"                 Such\n\ninterventions     would    \"likely     do    little\"    to   reduce   Kosilek's\n\ndysphoria    or   the   risk   of    harm   to   her.    Only     surgery,   they\n\nconcluded, could do this, and there was \"no good clinical reason to\n\nwithhold that treatment at this time.\"\n\n             The judge also ordered Dennehy to review the evidence\n\npresented at trial and decide whether the DOC would reverse its\n\nposition on surgery for Kosilek. After doing so, Dennehy indicated\n\nto the court that Drs. Appelbaum's and Brewer's testimony confirmed\n\nwhat she suspected (but apparently did not previously find clear):\n\nthat the doctors believed surgery was medically necessary. Dennehy\n\nstood firm though; she advised Judge Wolf that her decision not to\n\n\na women's prison.\"\n\n                                      -40-\n\fallow sex reassignment surgery for Kosilek remained.                Her safety\n\nand security concerns with providing surgery, which Dennehy called\n\n\"alarming and substantial,\" had not changed.\n\n                      3. Second Round of Testimony\n\n            Testimony resumed in early October 2006, with various\n\nwitnesses    taking   and   re-taking       the   stand.    First    came   Dr.\n\nAppelbaum, who emphasized several points.             Kosilek had a serious\n\nmedical need because there was a serious risk of harm if she was\n\nnot adequately treated; and he had informed Dennehy of this.\n\nAntidepressants were unlikely to effectively treat Kosilek because\n\nthe source of her distress was her gender identity disorder and\n\nmedication would not target this underlying condition.                 Rather,\n\nsurgery,    he    explained,   was    the    \"recognized    and   appropriate\n\ntreatment\" and the only treatment \"likely to significantly relieve,\n\nif not eliminate Miss Kosilek's distress.\"\n\n            Dr. Kevin Kapila from the Fenway Center also spoke.             He\n\ncalled Kosilek's gender identity disorder \"one of the more severe\n\ncases\" he had ever seen and he testified about the report he and\n\nDr. Kaufman had written.       In his opinion, Kosilek had a serious\n\nmedical need and there was a substantial risk of harm if she was\n\nnot treated with surgery.            Dr. Kapila also testified that he\n\nthought     Dr.    Schmidt's    recommendation        was   unreasonable.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Kapila (who had reviewed Dr. Schmidt's testimony)\n\nopined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Dr.\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\fSchmidt's plan to treat Kosilek with psychotherapy and medication\n\nwas inadequate.      Pointing to his own evaluation of Kosilek after\n\nshe had been receiving psychotherapy and hormones for seventeen\n\nmonths, Dr. Kapila noted her symptoms had still not resolved; \"she\n\nstill was dealing with discomfort around having male genitalia.\"\n\nDr. Schmidt's approach would not deal with this core problem — only\n\nsurgery could — and, Dr. Kapila continued, one tries to treat the\n\nproblem, not merely the symptoms.\n\n           Dr.     Kaufman   then   got    recalled.       While   she    agreed\n\nKosilek's dysphoria had improved as a result of receiving hormone\n\ntreatments and gender-appropriate items and clothing, Dr. Kaufman\n\npersisted in opining that Kosilek still had a serious medical need\n\nand if she did not receive surgery there was a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm.    Despite all the treatment Kosilek had received, she\n\nstill continued to experience severe dysphoria.              Like Dr. Kapila,\n\nDr. Kaufman did not think the treatment advocated by Dr. Schmidt\n\nwas adequate.      It is important to distinguish between depression\n\nand dysphoria, she said, and Dr. Schmidt's treatment would not\n\nsufficiently address the latter.\n\n           UMass's Medical Director, Dr. Arthur Brewer, was up next.\n\nHe had little to add to the testimony of the other medical\n\nproviders because, as medical director, he was not involved in\n\nUMass's   mental    health   program      and   had   no   role   in   Kosilek's\n\ntreatment.      His position remained the same as in his and Dr.\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fAppelbaum's September 18, 2006 letter, which supported the Fenway\n\nCenter doctors and criticized Dr. Schmidt's approach.\n\n             Judge Wolf then again heard from Commissioner Dennehy.\n\nShe accepted that Kosilek had a serious medical need but said she\n\nhad previously been confused about whether surgery was medically\n\nnecessary.     While she had now \"deduced\" UMass's opinion on the\n\nappropriateness of surgery for Kosilek, she had not changed her\n\nthoughts on the security and safety concerns related to providing\n\nsuch surgery. Absent these concerns, Dennehy agreed she would have\n\nno reason to interfere with any medical order for treatment.\n\n             The court questioned Dennehy about her awareness of any\n\npublicity surrounding Kosilek's case.    Dennehy was generally aware\n\nof a couple of articles appearing in the Boston papers and admitted\n\nskimming one.     She also knew about an article on a national news\n\nmedia website. In general she tried not to read newspaper articles\n\nthat involved her and she never thought about what the public and\n\npolitical reaction would be if the DOC allowed Kosilek to have\n\nsurgery.\n\n                     4. The Court-Appointed Expert\n\n             After hearing all the witnesses each side wished to\n\npresent, Judge Wolf decided to appoint an expert in order to help\n\nhim decide whether the care proposed by Dr. Schmidt was objectively\n\nadequate.    See Fed. R. Evid. 706 (providing that the court may on\n\nits own initiative appoint an expert).        After soliciting the\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fparties' thoughts on who to appoint, Judge Wolf selected Stephen\n\nLevine, M.D., on October 31, 2006.    Dr. Levine practiced at the\n\nCenter for Marital and Sexual Health in Ohio and was a clinical\n\nprofessor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School\n\nof Medicine.   The court informed Dr. Levine that Kosilek had been\n\nliving as a woman in prison and instructed him to treat this case\n\nas if Kosilek were just another patient out in free society,\n\nwithout all the issues attendant to her being incarcerated.\n\n          A month later, Dr. Levine, who did not interview Kosilek,\n\nissued a written report.    Commenting on the views held by Drs.\n\nBrown and Schmidt, he noted they \"reflect the current polarities\n\nwithin psychiatry\" with each of their respective positions having\n\nmerit.   He wrote that \"Dr. Schmidt's view, however unpopular and\n\nuncompassionate in the eyes of some experts in GID, is within\n\nprudent professional community standards.\"\n\n          In addition to submitting his report, Dr. Levine also\n\ntestified on December 19, 2006.   At first, he reiterated that the\n\ntreatment recommended by Dr. Schmidt, though perhaps not popular,\n\nwas within prudent professional standards.   He thought Kosilek had\n\nobtained a good amount of relief from being on hormones and\n\ndressing as a woman and was probably as feminine as she was going\n\nto be; surgery would be \"icing on the cake\" he said.   Dr. Levine,\n\nlike Dr. Schmidt, stopped short of saying that Kosilek would try to\n\nkill herself if she was denied surgery.   He thought it was just a\n\n\n                               -44-\n\fpossibility and Kosilek's impulse could perhaps change over time.\n\nAnd, he added, even if Kosilek received the surgery, it was\n\npossible that, having nothing left to fight for, she could still\n\nexperience    an   emotional   crisis   and   contemplate   suicide.      In\n\ngeneral, Dr. Levine had criticisms of both Dr. Schmidt's and Dr.\n\nBrown's reports, but he thought they were both reasonable.\n\n             During questioning by Judge Wolf, it seemed Dr. Levine\n\nhad not followed some of the court's directives about not taking\n\ninto account the fact that Kosilek was in prison.                  Presuming\n\nKosilek would never be free, Dr. Levine did agree Kosilek had lived\n\na real-life experience as a woman in prison.        He also believed she\n\nessentially met all the eligibility and readiness requirements for\n\nsurgery under the Standards of Care.            Dr. Levine opined that\n\nproviding Kosilek with surgery, assuming she had met the real-life\n\nexperience     requirement,    would    be    consistent    with     prudent\n\nprofessional practice.     And although Dr. Levine had earlier in his\n\ntestimony found Dr. Schmidt's approach to be prudent, he clarified\n\nthat putting aside issues such as cost and security, it would not\n\nbe within prudent professional standards to deny Kosilek surgery.\n\n             After hearing Dr. Levine's testimony, the court asked the\n\nUMass doctors to prepare a written letter indicating what treatment\n\nthe DOC would propose as a possible alternative to surgery.            In a\n\nletter filed with the court on February 22, 2007, Dr. Brewer\n\nindicated that, after consulting with Drs. Kapila and Kaufman, he\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\ffelt that, if denied surgery, Kosilek should receive psychotherapy\n\nand should continue to receive hormones and feminine clothes and\n\nitems.   However, Dr. Brewer hastened to add what Drs. Kapila and\n\nKaufman had repeatedly advised him: such treatment was \"likely\n\ngoing to be ineffective to relieve Ms. Kosilek's distress and may\n\nwell result in self harm or suicide.\"\n\n                       5. Third Round of Testimony\n\n             Trial picked back up on March 15, 2007, with Kosilek\n\nagain calling Dr. Kaufman, as well as an additional witness, Dr.\n\nMarshall Forstein of Harvard Medical School and the Cambridge\n\nHealth Alliance.\n\n             Dr. Forstein, who had evaluated Kosilek on behalf of the\n\nDOC around the time of Kosilek I (and testified in that trial),\n\nevaluated Kosilek again in 2005. Kosilek called on Dr. Forstein to\n\naddress whether surgery was appropriate and if psychotherapy would\n\nbe a reasonable alternative to surgery.            Sex reassignment surgery,\n\nDr. Forstein opined, was the only reasonable treatment for Kosilek\n\nfor preventing the potential for self-mutilation or death.                   He\n\nthought surgery was probably not appropriate for actively suicidal\n\npatients, but he did not find Kosilek to be so.                    Nor did Dr.\n\nForstein think psychotherapy or antidepressants were reasonable\n\nalternatives to surgery for Kosilek.\n\n             Dr.   Kaufman   again   made    her   views   clear    during   her\n\ntestimony:    \"We   don't    recommend      psychotherapy.     We    recommend\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\fsurgery.\"      Psychotherapy,   she   said,    does   not   relieve   gender\n\nidentity disorder, especially when it is severe: \"rather than\n\ntrying to change the mind, we find that we need to change the\n\nbody.\"    After this testimony, both parties rested.\n\n                6. Commissioner Clarke Enters the Fray\n\n             On May 2, 2007, Dennehy informed the court she was no\n\nlonger commissioner of the DOC and James Bender had taken her\n\nplace.      Bender's tenure was short and he never testified.            His\n\nsuccessor, Harold Clarke, became commissioner in November 2007.\n\n             In April 2008, the court ordered Clarke to review certain\n\ntrial transcripts, to submit a report of his conclusions, and to\n\noffer testimony at a hearing to be held the following month.\n\nClarke submitted his report to the court on May 7, 2008.20            In it,\n\nhe   took     the   same   stance   as     Dennehy    had   before    him.\n\n\"Insurmountable\" is how Clarke characterized his concerns attendant\n\nto providing Kosilek with sex reassignment surgery.            Ticking off\n\nseveral of those concerns, Clarke claimed that transporting Kosilek\n\nout of the state for surgery would pose a flight risk based on\n\nKosilek's life sentence and her exodus from the state after killing\n\nher wife.21    Next, he claimed there were flight risks with housing\n\n\n     20\n       In connection with preparing the report, Clarke read the\ntestimony of Kosilek, Dennehy, Spencer, and Bissonnette. He had\nalso reviewed several trial exhibits including the Fenway Report\nand Dr. Seil's report.\n     21\n        Like Bissonnette, Clarke considered Kosilek's earlier\nflight, even though the DOC classification manual says pre-\n\n                                    -47-\n\fKosilek post-surgery at MCI-Framingham, as it was not as secure as\n\nMCI-Norfolk, and Kosilek would pose a risk to the female inmates\n\nand vice versa.   Clarke opined that the only viable post-operative\n\noption would be to place Kosilek in the Special Management Unit at\n\nMCI-Norfolk where she would be on lock down twenty-three hours a\n\nday.\n\n           Clarke's written report highlighted other problems he\n\nenvisioned.    An out-of-state transfer was not a viable option\n\nbecause there was no guarantee another state would take Kosilek or,\n\nif it did, that the state would keep her.            Nor did Clarke think a\n\nspecial unit for inmates with gender identity disorder would work\n\nas such inmates vary greatly in their security and treatment needs.\n\nFurther, providing Kosilek with surgery in response to her threats\n\nof suicide would be \"contrary to well-established correctional\n\npractices.\"   Inmates should not \"be permitted to manipulate the\n\nsystem   utilizing   a   'do   it   or   else'    theory.\"   All   of   these\n\nconclusions, Clarke explained, were based on his own correctional\n\nexperience, and he expressly disclaimed reliance on any political,\n\nmedia, or cost-related influences.\n\n           A few days after submitting his report, on May 12 and 13,\n\n2008, Clarke came before Judge Wolf.             He reiterated the security\n\nconcerns outlined in his report, but was forced to make a few\n\nconcessions on cross-examination. Clarke did not know that Kosilek\n\n\ncustodial flight should not be considered when classifying inmates.\n\n                                    -48-\n\fwas, at that time, fifty-eight years old; he had assumed she was\n\nmuch younger.     Prisoners in their fifties, he agreed, generally\n\ncease to be aggressive and have a calming effect in the prison\n\nenvironment.    Clarke, who did not consult with any of the prison\n\nsuperintendents in connection with his review, had also never read\n\nKosilek's recent classification report and was not aware of her\n\nexcellent disciplinary record.      Yes, he was aware Kosilek had been\n\ntransported to scores of doctor's appointments without any attempt\n\nat escape and he agreed that if need be the DOC could, \"with some\n\ndegree of certainty,\" safely transport Kosilek for surgery out of\n\nstate.   Clarke also acknowledged that his previous employer, the\n\nState of Washington Department of Corrections (he had been the\n\nsecretary of this DOC), had housed without any issues a post-\n\noperative   female   transgender   inmate,   who   was   serving   a   life\n\nsentence for murdering his sister, in one of its women's prisons.\n\n            Clarke was also asked about some letters he had recently\n\nreceived from Massachusetts lawmakers.       In particular, a few days\n\nafter he was ordered by the court to testify, Clarke received a\n\nletter signed by seventeen Massachusetts state senators voicing\n\ntheir concerns over Clarke's review of Kosilek's case.                 The\n\nsenators \"urge[d]\" Clarke to deny Kosilek's request for surgery as\n\nit would be an \"affront to the taxpayers\" and \"raise a significant\n\nsecurity risk.\"      A decision in favor of Kosilek would \"send the\n\nwrong message to the citizens of Massachusetts.\"         Around that same\n\n\n                                   -49-\n\ftime Clarke received another letter signed by twenty-five state\n\nrepresentatives. Similar sentiments were expressed in that letter.\n\nThe representatives vented their \"outrage\" at Kosilek's request,\n\nciting state budget concerns, and contended providing the surgery\n\nwould \"set a bad precedent.\"     At trial, Clarke said he did not\n\nrespond to the letters as he thought it would be inappropriate\n\ngiven the review he was tasked with. Nonetheless, Clarke was aware\n\nthe lawmakers were drafting legislation seeking to limit the\n\nstate's ability to expend funds in this case.      He was not however\n\n(he said) influenced by the legislators' ire or any of the media's\n\nanti-Kosilek coverage.\n\n                    7. The Trial Comes to an End\n\n            After Clarke completed his testimony, the parties made\n\nclosing statements.    Then, two years after it had begun, Kosilek's\n\ntrial came to an end.     No more testimony was taken by the court\n\nafter May 2008.   In total the court had sat for twenty-eight days\n\nof trial.    However time rolled on, and in 2009 and again in 2011\n\nJudge Wolf heard additional arguments from the parties to address\n\nrecent judicial decisions and developments.\n\n                      G. The Kosilek II Decision\n\n            On September 4, 2012, after confirming with the parties\n\nthey had nothing new to report, Judge Wolf issued his decision.\n\nSee Kosilek II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 190.    The decision was lengthy\n\n(126 pages); it contained a thorough history of Kosilek's quest, a\n\n\n                                 -50-\n\fdetailed summary of the evidence adduced at trial, and loads of\n\nfactual findings.         In order to prevail on her claim, Judge Wolf\n\nfound    Kosilek      had     to     prove     five    things:    the     first     two\n\nconsiderations      as      part    of   the    Eighth     Amendment's     objective\n\ncomponent, the last three as part of its subjective prong. Kosilek\n\nhad to establish that: (1) she has a serious medical need; (2) the\n\nneed can only be adequately treated with sex reassignment surgery;\n\n(3) the DOC knows that Kosilek is at a high risk for serious harm\n\nif surgery is not performed; (4) the DOC did not deny Kosilek the\n\nsurgery based on a legitimate penological purpose, namely good\n\nfaith,     reasonable        security        concerns;     and   (5)      the     DOC's\n\nunconstitutional conduct will continue in the future. The decision\n\naddressed each piece in turn.\n\n             First,      with      respect     to    the   serious   medical       need\n\ncomponent,    the     court     found    that       credible   evidence    at     trial\n\nestablished that Kosilek suffered from severe gender identity\n\ndisorder and would suffer serious harm if it was not adequately\n\ntreated.      The court focused on Kosilek's threat of suicide\n\n(determined to be credible and not manufactured) and the fact that\n\nmultiple highly qualified doctors employed by the DOC had diagnosed\n\nKosilek with a severe form of gender identity disorder, a diagnosis\n\nconfirmed by Drs. Brown and Forstein.                      The court's takeaway:\n\nKosilek had established a serious medical need.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -51-\n\f            On point two — what treatment was adequate to address\n\nthis need — the court found the following.            The Standards of Care\n\ndictated a three-part sequence that called for hormone therapy, a\n\nreal-life experience living as the opposite sex, and then sex\n\nreassignment surgery (though not all patients need or want all\n\nthese things).     Kosilek of course had been on hormone therapy and\n\nthe court concluded the evidence showed that she underwent a real-\n\nlife experience living as a woman in prison.           The court found Drs.\n\nBrown,    Kaufman,     and   Forstein     credible   when    they   testified,\n\nconsistent with the Standards of Care, that surgery was medically\n\nnecessary for some individuals with severe gender identity disorder\n\nand, indeed, medically necessary for Kosilek herself.                  It also\n\nconcluded, relying in part on the opinions of Drs. Appelbaum and\n\nLevine,   that   Dr.    Schmidt's   proposed     alternative     treatment   of\n\npsychotherapy, antidepressants, and suicide watch did not meet\n\nprudent professional standards.             More specifically, the court\n\ndetermined     that    Dr.    Schmidt's     categorical     views   about    sex\n\nreassignment     surgery,     including    his   refusal    to   recommend   sex\n\nreassignment surgery for patients, were not supported by the\n\nStandards of Care.           Moreover, the treatment advocated by Dr.\n\nSchmidt would not treat the cause of Kosilek's mental anguish (it\n\nwould diminish the symptoms at most) or reduce her suffering to the\n\npoint that she no longer had a serious medical need.                    Having\n\ndetermined that Kosilek had proven she had a serious medical need\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\fthat had not been treated adequately, the court decided that\n\nKosilek had satisfied the objective prong of the Eighth Amendment\n\ntest.   The court then turned its attention to the so-called\n\nsubjective prong: in essence, did the DOC know of and disregard an\n\nexcessive risk to Kosilek's health.\n\n          The court started with the third issue it had outlined —\n\nwhether the DOC knew that Kosilek was at risk for serious harm if\n\nsurgery was not performed.     As a threshold matter, the court\n\nconsidered who within the DOC should be its focus as far as who\n\nknew what and when.     The court determined, based in part on\n\nstipulations from the parties, that former DOC Commissioner Dennehy\n\nwas the sole decision-maker on the issue of whether security\n\nconcerns should preclude Kosilek from getting surgery.     And Dr.\n\nAppelbaum of UMass, it decided, should be the focus of the court's\n\ndetermination about whether the DOC was aware that Kosilek had a\n\nserious need for surgery.    Ultimately though, the court decided\n\nthis was a distinction without a difference because the evidence\n\nestablished that both Dennehy and Dr. Appelbaum were aware of facts\n\nfrom which they could infer — and did in fact draw the inference —\n\nthat \"a substantial risk of serious harm to Kosilek existed.\"   The\n\ncourt focused on Dr. Appelbaum's numerous communications with\n\nDennehy in which he advised her of the serious risks faced by\n\nKosilek if the Fenway Center's proposed course of treatment was not\n\nundertaken.   It also looked to the fact that Dennehy had read the\n\n\n                               -53-\n\fKosilek I decision, read testimony in this case, and that, in her\n\nown testimony, she ultimately did not dispute that Kosilek had a\n\nserious medical need.\n\n             The court's analysis proceeded to the fourth factor —\n\nthat   is,   whether    the   DOC    denied   Kosilek    surgery    based     on   a\n\nlegitimate penological purpose.          First, the court explained it is\n\nnot legally permissible to deny a prisoner medical treatment based\n\non cost alone, but the court did not find cost to be the basis for\n\nthe DOC's decision here.            Noting the DOC's provision of various\n\nexpensive     medical    treatments      to   many   prisoners,       the     court\n\nspecifically declined to find that the DOC's denial of surgery to\n\nKosilek was motivated by the high cost of the treatment. The court\n\nthen moved on to the main bone of contention, which was whether the\n\nDOC's proffered security concerns were its real reason for denying\n\nKosilek surgery.       If the DOC's decision was made in good faith and\n\nbased on reasonable security concerns, the court said it would\n\ndefer to the DOC's decision.           However, such deference was not to\n\nbe.    Quite the contrary, the court found that, after a long period\n\nof    pretense   and    prevarication,     Dennehy      persisted   in      falsely\n\nasserting that providing Kosilek with the surgery would present\n\ninsurmountable     security    concerns.       The   court    found    Dennehy's\n\nsecurity excuses nothing more than a pretext to deny Kosilek\n\nsurgery.      Indeed, it was a \"fear of controversy, criticism,\n\nridicule, and scorn\" that was the real driving force behind the\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\fDOC's decision to withhold surgery.    In support of its conclusion,\n\nthe court cited Dennehy's pattern of delay, deviation from DOC\n\npolicy, feigned ignorance about what treatment DOC doctors were\n\nrecommending, failure to do a thorough security evaluation before\n\nmaking up her mind, the unrealistic nature of the supposed security\n\nrisks, and the public and political outcry against Kosilek.            It\n\nsummed things up this way: \"Because there is no penological\n\njustification for denying Kosilek the treatment prescribed for\n\n[her], [s]he is now being subject to the 'unnecessary and wanton\n\ninfliction of pain' prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\n           Expressing a reticence to tell the DOC how to discharge\n\nits duty, and lamenting the fact that the DOC had not just made the\n\nproper medical decisions on its own, the court moved on to the\n\nfinal consideration, which was whether the DOC's unconstitutional\n\nconduct, absent court intervention, would continue.       Based on the\n\nDOC's pattern of unconstitutional conduct as chronicled above, the\n\ncourt determined the DOC's deliberate indifference would not cease\n\nwithout   judicial   intervention.     Kosilek   was   entitled   to   an\n\ninjunction.   Because an injunction must be narrowly tailored, the\n\ncourt declined to decide who should do the surgery, where it should\n\nbe done, or where Kosilek should be housed afterwards.            Rather\n\nJudge Wolf simply ordered the DOC to provide Kosilek with sex\n\nreassignment surgery.      The order read: \"Defendant shall take\n\n\n\n\n                                -55-\n\fforthwith all of the actions reasonably necessary to provide\n\nKosilek sex reassignment surgery as promptly as possible.\"\n\n          The DOC quickly filed this appeal and moved the district\n\ncourt to stay its order to provide Kosilek with surgery pending\n\nresolution of the appeal, which the court did.\n\n                     II. THE ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n          After setting forth the extensive backdrop of Kosilek's\n\nodyssey, we start by narrowing the issues before us.       On appeal,\n\nthe DOC attacks the district court's decision but limits its\n\noffensive to just a couple of issues.     To start, it does not take\n\numbrage with many of the district court's findings, namely that\n\nKosilek has a serious medical need, that the DOC knows she has a\n\nserious medical need, that surgery could appropriately treat this\n\nneed, or that injunctive relief (should the DOC's conduct be deemed\n\nunlawful) is an appropriate vehicle for relief.      And based on the\n\nevidence adduced at trial, we think the DOC would not have had\n\nstrong arguments on any of these points.\n\n          The two basic criticisms the DOC levels at the district\n\ncourt's decision are the following.       First, it claims the court\n\nerred in finding that the DOC's decision not to provide Kosilek sex\n\nreassignment   surgery   constitutes    inadequate   medical   care   in\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.      Second, it contends the court\n\nerred in finding the DOC deliberately indifferent to Kosilek's need\n\nfor treatment.   We elaborate.\n\n\n                                 -56-\n\f           On    point    one,   the    DOC   argues   that    surgery    is    not\n\nconstitutionally required because the treatment Kosilek is already\n\nreceiving — psychotherapy, hormones, permanent hair removal, and\n\naccess to female clothing and cosmetics — is adequate. Kosilek, it\n\ncontends, is not entitled to the most sophisticated or desirable\n\ntreatment or to curative treatment, as opposed to treatment for her\n\nmental illness.          And should Kosilek engage in self-injurious\n\nbehavior (e.g., attempt to commit suicide) if denied surgery, the\n\nDOC   contends     treating      this     behavior     with         methods    like\n\npsychotherapy, antidepressants, and a protective environment would\n\nbe adequate.     In sum, the DOC thinks the court erred when it found\n\nthe DOC's current and proposed treatment course inadequate (i.e.,\n\nfailed to meet prudent professional standards) under the Eighth\n\nAmendment and the sex reassignment surgery medically necessary.\n\n           Kosilek disagrees. She counters that the court correctly\n\nfound surgery to be the only adequate treatment for her serious\n\nmedical need — a finding supported by more than ample evidence.\n\nKosilek points out that almost all of the medical professionals who\n\ntestified at trial agreed this was the case, and only the DOC's\n\nexperts   disagreed;      Kosilek      says   the   court     was    entitled    to\n\ndisbelieve them.     She claims the evidence also establishes that,\n\neven with hormones and psychotherapy, her mental anguish is severe\n\nand the DOC's proposed course of treatment would not sufficiently\n\n\n\n\n                                       -57-\n\freduce this.     Sex reassignment surgery is medically necessary,\n\naccording to Kosilek.\n\n           As to the court's deliberate indifference finding, the\n\nDOC contends the court erred in rejecting the safety and security\n\nconcerns presented by DOC officials at trial in support of their\n\ndecision to withhold surgery, which they say were based on their\n\nbest correctional judgment and were reasonable and not pretextual.\n\nThe DOC \"vigorously disputes\" that the public criticism of Kosilek\n\nand her request for surgery had any impact on the decision-making\n\nprocess of Commissioner Dennehy or her successor, Clarke. However,\n\nother than this broad assertion it says little else about Dennehy\n\nherself and her motives. Instead it homes in on Dennehy's ultimate\n\nsuccessor Clarke, claiming that he should be the focus of this\n\ncourt's determination as to the validity of the security concerns\n\nvoiced by the DOC (despite the DOC's at-trial stipulation that\n\nDennehy was the operative decision-maker).22         There was an absence\n\nof evidence in the record, says the DOC, that Clarke's proffered\n\nsecurity concerns were exaggerated or made in bad faith and so, the\n\ncourt was required to accord him deference.             Further, the DOC\n\npoints    out   Kosilek   offered    no    counter   correctional   expert\n\ntestimony, and the district court did not find that Superintendent\n\n\n\n     22\n       At oral argument counsel for the DOC clarified that he does\nnot suggest that this court disregard Dennehy's testimony, only\nthat it should focus on Clarke's as it is more relevant being\ncloser in time.\n\n                                    -58-\n\fBissonnette or Spencer acted in bad faith or were tainted by a fear\n\nof public criticism.\n\n           On the court's deliberate indifference finding, Kosilek\n\nargues that the DOC had no legitimate security reason to withhold\n\nsurgery and importantly, more than sufficient evidence supported\n\nthe court's conclusion that the alleged security concerns were\n\npretextual.    Kosilek points to several pieces of evidence: the\n\nsecurity decision was made before any security review occurred; a\n\nsubsequent security review did not follow DOC procedure; the\n\nsecurity report was hastily drafted by trial counsel; and the\n\nsecurity evaluation that was performed did not take into account\n\ncertain    fundamental   factors    like       Kosilek's   age   and     good\n\ndisciplinary record.     Kosilek adds that there was evidence that\n\nKosilek's transportation to surgery and post-operative placement\n\nwould not be actually impossible from a security perspective.             As\n\nsuch, no \"mechanical deference\" is owed to the DOC, according to\n\nKosilek,   whose   argument   focuses     on   the   illegitimacy   of   the\n\nproffered security concerns rather than the supposed role public\n\ncriticism played in the DOC's decision.         Kosilek also lambasts the\n\nDOC for attempting to distance itself from Dennehy on appeal since\n\nbelow the DOC stipulated that Dennehy's motivations should be the\n\nfocus and in fact objected to Clarke's testimony as unnecessary.\n\n           With the arguments delineated and the issues narrowed, we\n\nturn to the operative law.\n\n\n                                   -59-\n\f                     III.

For example, in a recent Eighth Amendment case\n\nsimilar to this one, we reviewed the district court's determination\n\nthat the state had been deliberately indifferent to the needs of a\n\nprisoner suffering from gender identity disorder by asking whether\n\nthe court had a \"reasonable basis\" for its conclusion, not whether\n\nthe district court actually reached the right decision.            Battista,\n\n645 F.3d at 454-55.       Here, the success of Kosilek's claim depends\n\nalmost entirely on questions of credibility (in assessing the\n\nstate's motives) and on questions of medical care (in assessing\n\nKosilek's medical needs). These are exactly the kinds of questions\n\nthat we must review deferentially, especially where, as here, there\n\nis ample testimony precisely and directly supporting the district\n\ncourt's answers to such questions.\n\n            With the parameters of our review cleared up, we move on\n\nto the merits of this case.\n\n                          V. THE OBJECTIVE PRONG\n\n            As we said, the DOC does not dispute that Kosilek has a\n\nserious medical need. The real issue is whether the district court\n\n\n                                      -66-\n\ferred in finding that the care the DOC has provided Kosilek with\n\n(i.e., hormones, psychotherapy, and feminine items) and proposes to\n\nprovide her with to relieve any self-injurious behavior (i.e.,\n\npsychotherapy, antidepressants, and a protective environment) is\n\nadequate.    Said another way, is, as the district court found, sex\n\nreassignment surgery medically necessary and the only appropriate\n\ntreatment for Kosilek?\n\n            Our review starts off with the DOC's expert Dr. Schmidt,\n\nwho the district court concluded was not a prudent professional.27\n\nThis finding was not clearly erroneous.         First, Dr. Schmidt\n\nexpressed a good deal of disagreement with the Standards of Care.28\n\nHowever, the Standards of Care were widely relied upon and trusted\n\nby the other medical providers who testified at trial and have been\n\ncited by the courts as generally accepted.   See, e.g., De'Lonta v.\n\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522-23 (4th Cir. 2013) (describing the\n\n\n     27\n       In its decision, the court noted it had considered Osborne's\ntestimony but was not discussing it separately because she\ntestified consistent with her colleague Dr. Schmidt and there was\na question as to whether she should even be considered in the\nprudent professional debate because she is a social worker and not\na medical doctor. We take the same tack and focus on Dr. Schmidt.\n     28\n       The Seventh Version of the Standards of Care, which, as\nindicated, came out in 2011, contains a new section addressing the\napplicability of the standards to persons living in institutional\nenvironments such as prison or long-term care facilities.\nStandards of Care, Version 7, at 67.

The Standards of Care indicate that for persons with\n\nsevere   gender    identity   disorder,      sex   reassignment      surgery   is\n\neffective.      Standards of Care at 18.

Surgery is\n\nnot, the Standards of Care say, \"experimental, investigational,\n\nelective, cosmetic, or optional in any meaningful sense.\" Id.

Dr. Schmidt's views regarding the need\n\nfor surgery for patients with severe gender identity disorder was\n\nnot only unsupported by the Standards of Care but also contradicted\n\nby the testimony of the other medical providers at trial.\n\n          As for what treatment was appropriate for Kosilek in\n\nparticular, Dr. Schmidt opined that surgery was not necessary as\n\nKosilek had done well just using hormones thus far.        The main\n\nbarrier Dr. Schmidt saw was that, in his opinion, a real-life\n\nexperience living as the opposite gender could not be effectively\n\nreplicated in prison.     Rather, Dr. Schmidt's proposed course of\n\ntreatment was to utilize psychotherapy and medication to reduce\n\nKosilek's dysphoria to a point where she was no longer at risk for\n\nserious harm.     Should her suicidal desires persist, Dr. Schmidt\n\nthought Kosilek could be effectively managed in a medical facility.\n\nHowever, a majority of the other medical providers who testified at\n\ntrial regarding Dr. Schmidt's proposed course of treatment thought\n\nit was unreasonable (namely, Drs. Kapila, Kaufman, Appelbaum, and\n\nForstein).29    The consensus was that Dr. Schmidt's approach would\n\n\n     29\n       We do not list Dr. Levine among these providers because, as\nthe reader will recall, there was some change in his testimony.\nInitially he opined that Dr. Schmidt's view, though unpopular, was\nreasonable. However, Dr. Levine apparently had disregarded the\ncourt's order to treat Kosilek as if she were a patient out in free\n\n                                -69-\n\fnot effectively treat the real issue, which was Kosilek's gender\n\nidentity disorder, or significantly relieve her distress to a level\n\nwhere she was not at risk for serious harm.             As Dr. Kapila\n\nexplained, Kosilek's symptoms and distress had not been resolved\n\nthough she had been on hormones for some time.\n\n             Ultimately,   the   court   was    confronted   with   two\n\ndiametrically opposed opinions, both given by qualified medical\n\nprofessionals. Given the contradictory evidence, which was heavily\n\nweighted against the DOC, we are far from left with the impression\n\nthat the trial court made a mistake when it determined that Dr.\n\nSchmidt was not a prudent professional or that his approach was\n\nunreasonable.     See Janeiro, 457 F.3d at 138.      The court did not\n\nclearly err.\n\n             The question that remains is what treatment is medically\n\nadequate to treat Kosilek.       The DOC twists the district court's\n\nholding, claiming that it impermissibly held that the Eighth\n\nAmendment requires treatment that actually \"cures\" the inmate's\n\ncondition.    The court said no such thing.    It simply found that the\n\nonly adequate treatment in this case was sex reassignment surgery.\n\n\n\nsociety.   After being reminded of those parameters, Dr. Levine\nclarified his opinion.    He said, putting aside a variety of\nconcerns about the surgery, including cost, security, and the\nrequirement of a \"real life experience,\" prudent professionals do\nnot ordinarily prevent a patient from receiving sex reassignment\nsurgery.   But even were we to disregard Dr. Levine's opinion\nentirely, there was ample evidentiary support for the court's\nconclusion that Dr. Schmidt's approach was not prudent.\n\n                                  -70-\n\fAnd   though,   according    to    the    experts,      surgery    did   have   the\n\npotential to cure or at least greatly alleviate Kosilek's gender\n\nidentity disorder, this does not translate to a finding by the\n\ncourt that only curative treatment passes constitutional muster.\n\nTo give an example, if Kosilek had cancer and the court found\n\nchemotherapy to be the only adequate treatment under the Eighth\n\nAmendment, as opposed to, say, an aspirin, it would not necessarily\n\nfollow that the court held that the Eighth Amendment requires an\n\ninmate to be cured.     The DOC's argument misses the mark.\n\n           However,    as    the    district      court   found,    there   is    a\n\ndifference between treating the underlying disorder and treating\n\nonly its symptoms.     The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals drew a\n\nsimilar distinction when it held that a Wisconsin statute which\n\nprohibited the state's department of corrections from providing\n\ntransgender inmates with hormones and sex reassignment surgery was\n\nunconstitutional.     Fields v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"222617\"><a href=\"/opinion/222617/fields-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552-53, 559 (7th\n\nCir. 2011).      The court, discussing how some patients require\n\nhormone therapy, noted that although the defendant department could\n\n\"provide    psychotherapy          as    well      as     antipsychotics        and\n\nantidepressants, defendants failed to present evidence rebutting\n\nthe testimony that these treatments do nothing to treat the\n\nunderlying disorder.\"       Id. at 556.        The defendants failed to show,\n\nthe court concluded, that another treatment could be an adequate\n\nstand-in for hormone therapy.           Id.\n\n\n                                        -71-\n\f             And providing some treatment is not the same as providing\n\nadequate treatment.       The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in\n\nDe'Lonta, 708 F.3d at 520, reversed the district court's dismissal\n\nof a transgender inmate's Eighth Amendment claim.          The court found\n\nthat the inmate, who sought sex reassignment surgery because her\n\ngender identity disorder symptoms persisted despite receiving\n\nhormones, stated a plausible deliberate indifference claim. Id. at\n\n522, 525.     Notably the court found that just because the Virginia\n\nDepartment    of   Corrections    had   provided   the   inmate   with   some\n\ntreatment for her gender identity disorder (hormone therapy and\n\npsychological counseling) consistent with the Standards of Care,\n\n\"it does not follow that they have necessarily provided her with\n\nconstitutionally adequate treatment.\"          Id. at 522, 526.   The court\n\nadded that total deprivation of care is not a prerequisite for a\n\nconstitutional violation.        Id. at 526.\n\n             Here there was testimony from the medical providers at\n\ntrial that the preferred approach is to treat the underlying\n\nproblem (the gender identity disorder) and not just the symptoms,\n\nas Dr. Schmidt proposed. \"[Y]ou treat the primary problem, you\n\ndon't treat symptoms,\" Dr. Kapila testified.                And while the\n\nevidence, as recognized by the district court, was that Kosilek had\n\nshown improvement being on hormones and had obtained some measure\n\nof stability holding on to the hope of receiving surgery, all the\n\nmedical providers, save Dr. Schmidt, agreed that this was not\n\n\n                                    -72-\n\fenough. As the Fenway Center doctors concluded early on, all signs\n\nindicated that Kosilek was still quite distressed and likely to\n\nsuffer serious harm in the form of suicide if not operated on.\n\n            The take-away from the evidence: surgery was the next\n\nlogical adequate treatment step.              Kosilek had been on hormones for\n\nsome time and the evidence, in the form of reports and testimony\n\nfrom the Fenway Center doctors and Drs. Forstein and Brown,\n\nsupported   the     notion   that    Kosilek      had    undergone     a   real-life\n\nexperience living as a woman in prison.                    In fact, Dr. Brown\n\ntestified that in his opinion Kosilek had not only met the minimum\n\nreal-life experience but had exceeded it. Dr. Brown focused on the\n\namount of information (presumably the significant medical and\n\ndisciplinary   records       kept   in    a     prison   setting)     that   existed\n\nregarding Kosilek's time in prison.                  Dr. Brown would not, he\n\nexplained, have such a thorough record with a patient in the\n\noutside    world.     And    Dr.    Schmidt's      opinion     that    a   real-life\n\nexperience could never be replicated in prison did not take into\n\naccount Kosilek's situation in particular, or more generally the\n\ndifferent realities of transgender prisoners.                   As the district\n\ncourt found, \"[f]or someone like Kosilek who is serving a sentence\n\nof life without the possibility of parole, prison is, and always\n\nwill be, [her] real life.\"\n\n            With the prerequisites for surgery satisfied, Drs. Brown,\n\nKaufman,     Forstein,       Kapila,      and      Appelbaum     all       testified\n\n\n                                         -73-\n\funequivocally: sex reassignment surgery was medically necessary and\n\nthe only appropriate treatment for Kosilek.    And they all agreed\n\nthat a very likely consequence of Kosilek not receiving the surgery\n\nwas a serious risk of harm, predominantly suicide. Kosilek herself\n\ntestified, and the court found credibly so, that though hormone\n\ntreatments had helped, she still suffers intense mental anguish\n\nover her male genitalia and believed she needed surgery.        As\n\nKosilek explained, she did not want to continue living with her\n\nmale genitalia and antidepressants and psychotherapy would not\n\nchange that.\n\n          We are bound by certain well-established adages: a party\n\nchallenging findings of fact after a bench trial \"faces a steep\n\nuphill climb\" and this court \"is not at liberty to start afresh.\"\n\nMonahan v. Romney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178675\"><a href=\"/opinion/178675/monahan-v-romney/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (1st Cir. 2010) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Here there was ample evidence to support\n\nthe district court's conclusion that sex reassignment surgery was\n\nthe only adequate treatment for Kosilek.      In fact, substantial\n\nevidence, notwithstanding Dr. Schmidt's testimony, pointed in that\n\ndirection. The court did not clearly err in deciding to credit the\n\nevidence and testimony offered by Kosilek and in concluding that\n\nthe objective component of the Eighth Amendment inquiry had been\n\nsatisfied.     In sum, where at least three eminently qualified\n\ndoctors testify without objection, in accord with widely accepted,\n\npublished standards, that Kosilek suffers from a life-threatening\n\n\n                               -74-\n\fdisorder    that     renders    surgery      medically      necessary,    and   the\n\nfactfinder is convinced by that testimony, we are at a loss to see\n\nhow this court can properly overrule that finding of fact.\n\n                            VI. THE SUBJECTIVE PRONG\n\n             The   basis       for    the     district      court's      deliberate\n\nindifference conclusion was its findings that the DOC had no valid\n\npenological reason to deny surgery.               As indicated earlier, the\n\njudge primarily focused on Dennehy (as the parties stipulated),\n\nconcluding    that    she    delayed   treatment,     deviated     from     policy,\n\ninadequately reviewed security ramifications, and manufactured\n\nsecurity concerns.       The court also assessed Clarke's motivations\n\nand concluded that Clarke's failure to do a thorough security\n\nreview suggested he did not operate with an open mind.                   Also found\n\nto   be   important    on    both    the    Dennehy   and    Clarke   front:    the\n\nunrealistic nature, in the court's mind, of the supposed security\n\nrisks and the public and political outcry against Kosilek.                      The\n\nissue for this court to decide is whether the record supported\n\nthese underlying factual conclusions.\n\n             First, let us get a few things out of the way.                Though a\n\nlot of the public and political opposition to Kosilek receiving\n\nsurgery involved a rally cry that taxpayers should not have to foot\n\nthe bill for the procedure, the district court did not think that\n\ncost considerations played any role in the DOC's decision to deny\n\nsurgery.     And both the parties agree with this point on appeal;\n\n\n                                       -75-\n\fthere was no evidence that the DOC withheld surgery because it was\n\ntoo expensive.    Therefore we have no cause to consider the cost\n\nissue.30   Second, as alluded to, the parties disagree about whether\n\nDennehy or Clarke or both should bear the brunt of this court's\n\nattention on the validity-of-the-security-concerns issue. In suits\n\nlike this one, where injunctive relief is sought \"to prevent a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious injury from ripening into actual harm,\"\n\nwe consider deliberate indifference \"'in light of the prison\n\nauthorities' current attitudes and conduct,' [and] their attitudes\n\nand conduct at the time suit is brought and persisting thereafter.\"\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 845 (quoting Helling v. McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n36 (1993)).    Therefore we will look at both Dennehy and Clarke.\n\nWith those preliminary points dealt with, we proceed to the merits.\n\n\n\n\n     30\n       Although the DOC has not argued the cost issue, much media\ncommentary focused on the cost of sex reassignment surgery for\nKosilek, and a prior commissioner of the DOC claimed that the\nsurgery was an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds.         As the\ndistrict court noted in Kosilek II, one Boston Globe column from\n2000 griped that Kosilek was \"demanding that the state, meaning you\nand me, pay the $25,000 for a sex-change operation.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 215.    While the record does not indicate if that number\nreflects the exact cost of the surgery today, it appears to be in\nthe ballpark. Yet, the cost of sex reassignment surgery pales in\ncomparison to the amount of money it seems the state will be\nexpending to defend this lawsuit. Around a year ago, Kosilek's\nattorneys filed a motion in the district court seeking to have the\nDOC pay them over $800,000 in fees and costs.       In a tentative\nruling issued from the bench, Judge Wolf indicated that he is\nplanning to order the DOC to pay around $700,000, though it does\nnot appear that this amount has yet been formalized in a written\norder.\n\n                                -76-\n\f             Clearly, when decisions about medical care are made in\n\nthe prison system, there are certain considerations not present in\n\nsociety at large. \"Any professional judgment that decides an issue\n\ninvolving conditions of confinement must embrace security and\n\nadministration and not merely medical judgments.\"      Battista, 645\n\nF.3d at 455. And because \"security considerations . . . matter at\n\nprisons\" and conflicting demands must be balanced by officials, the\n\ndeliberate indifference test \"leave[s] ample room for professional\n\njudgment.\"    Id. at 453, 454.\n\n             However, as we explained in Battista, at some point a\n\ndefendant forfeits the advantage of deference.       Id. at 455.   In\n\nBattista, which involved some of the same players as this case,\n\nthis court considered the claim of another transgender inmate suing\n\nthe Massachusetts DOC.     Id. at 450.   This court found the record\n\nsupported the district court's determination that the DOC had shown\n\ndeliberate indifference by refusing to provide the inmate with the\n\nhormone treatment that doctors had recommended for her.       Id. at\n\n450, 455.    As it does in this case, the DOC cited security concerns\n\nfor denying the recommended treatment.     Id. at 452.   Nonetheless,\n\nin reaching its result, the Battista court refused to give the DOC\n\nthe advantage of deference.      Id. at 455.   It cited a \"pattern of\n\ndelays, new objections substituted for old ones, misinformation\n\nand other negatives,\" including an initial failure to take the\n\ninmate's diagnosis of gender identity disorder and request for\n\n\n                                  -77-\n\fhormones seriously, the passage of years before a substantial\n\nsecurity justification was made, and the DOC's portrayal of the\n\nonly options as withholding hormones or placing the inmate in\n\nseverely constraining protective custody.       Id.\n\n          Here Judge Wolf found a very similar pattern of behavior\n\non the DOC's part and the record supports this finding.             On the\n\ndelay front, it has indisputably been many years since medical\n\nproviders started considering the propriety of surgery for Kosilek.\n\nDr. Forstein, back in then Commissioner Maloney's tenure (the years\n\n1997 to 2003) during the days of Kosilek I, had recommended that\n\nKosilek be allowed to consult with a surgeon who specialized in sex\n\nreassignment   surgery.    In   2003,     Dr.   Seil   made   the     same\n\nrecommendation, indicating that Kosilek should be allowed to meet\n\nwith a specialist after a year on hormones. Then in February 2005,\n\nthe Fenway Center doctors indicated after evaluating Kosilek that\n\nshe should be allowed to have surgery.     Dennehy herself was Deputy\n\nCommissioner during Kosilek I and was involved in the decisions\n\nmade in connection with that case.      And right when she started as\n\nCommissioner, Dennehy slowed things down.        She took the unusual\n\nstep in assuming an active role in a de novo blanket reassessment\n\nof the treatment of those inmates suffering from gender identity\n\ndisorder, including Kosilek, despite the fact that the DOC's\n\ncontract with UMass provided that the UMass medical professionals\n\nwould make the decisions about the medical care for inmates with\n\n\n                                -78-\n\fthis disorder and the Commissioner would only step in at the end to\n\nassess any security concerns.\n\n             The DOC explains away this delay by claiming that for a\n\nlong time it did not understand that UMass recommended surgery for\n\nKosilek, but the district court did not buy it.    And, in reality,\n\nthe issue seems to be one of semantics.    While there was testimony\n\nfrom Hughes and Martin that they knew UMass supported the Fenway\n\nCenter doctors' recommendation for surgery, they did not think\n\nUMass was clear enough on the logistics or whether surgery was\n\n\"medically necessary\" (as opposed to medically optional). However,\n\nDrs. Appelbaum and Brewer made pellucid in their June 14, 2005\n\nletter that they did not think it was within their purview to\n\ndecide as a legal matter whether surgery for Kosilek was medically\n\nnecessary.    Thus, in the end, there was evidence that the DOC knew\n\nthat Kosilek's medical providers were recommending surgery, and in\n\nresponse, the DOC dallied and disregarded.        This behavior is\n\nsignificant, as in order to establish a subjective intent, \"it is\n\nenough for the prisoner to show a wanton disregard sufficiently\n\nevidenced 'by denial, delay, or interference with prescribed health\n\ncare.'\" Battista, 645 F.3d at 453 (quoting DesRosiers, 949 F.2d at\n\n19); see also Johnson v. Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790697\"><a href=\"/opinion/790697/james-johnson-v-lester-wright-assoc-commissioner-health-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (2d Cir. 2005)\n\n(A \"deliberate indifference claim can lie where prison officials\n\ndeliberately ignore the medical recommendations of a prisoner's\n\ntreating physicians.\").\n\n\n                                 -79-\n\f             While the DOC maintains that it opposed surgery based on\n\nsecurity concerns, the district court did not clearly err in\n\nfinding     that    these    concerns     followed      hasty,    results-driven\n\nevaluations.       Written procedure adopted by the DOC required that,\n\nsubsequent to a medical provider's recommendation that an inmate\n\nreceive treatment for gender identity disorder, the Superintendent\n\nin the relevant prison would conduct a security assessment and make\n\na recommendation to the Commissioner. Despite this policy, the DOC\n\nconcluded,     as    was    reported    in     the    news   piece    Dennehy     was\n\ninterviewed for, that surgery for Kosilek \"would result in a\n\nsecurity nightmare\" before it ever conducted such a review.\n\n             Once the security review was eventually undertaken, the\n\nDOC did not give itself much time to complete it.                Although the DOC\n\nwas ordered by the court back on April 25, 2005 to conduct the\n\nreview, Dennehy, the attorneys, and the superintendents did not\n\nmeet until May 19 to produce the report, which was due to the court\n\non May 27.         The report was then penned predominantly by trial\n\ncounsel and reviewed by Dennehy only a day or two before it went to\n\nJudge Wolf.        This pattern of haste continued.              On November 23,\n\n2005, just nine days before expert disclosures were due, Dennehy\n\ncontacted the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons looking for\n\na recommendation for a security expert to testify at trial.                     When\n\nthe   DOC   experts    did   testify,    it     was   apparent,      as   the   court\n\nexplained, that both Dumond and Beeler \"failed to consider material\n\n\n                                        -80-\n\faspects   of   Kosilek's    history    and   personal   characteristics   in\n\nforming their opinions,\" such as her good disciplinary record or\n\nher medical records.       As a result, the court gave their testimony\n\n\"little weight.\"\n\n           As for Clarke's security review, the court criticized him\n\nfor not consulting with Spencer, then still the Superintendent of\n\nMCI-Norfolk, and for apparently not reviewing any of the DOC's\n\nexpert security testimony offered at trial, when deciding whether\n\nhe agreed with Dennehy's stance on surgery.             The DOC calls this\n\nfinding disingenuous since the court's order only called for Clarke\n\nto review certain testimony and Clarke testified that accordingly\n\nthis is what he did.        It is unclear whether Clarke shirked his\n\nreview responsibilities or genuinely felt that his review was\n\nlimited in scope.    But both views are permissible and when faced\n\nwith two permissible views of the evidence, the district judge's\n\nchoice of one of them cannot be clearly erroneous.            See Monahan,\n\n625 F.3d at 46.      Plus the thoroughness of Clarke's review is\n\nundercut by the fact that he did not know some important pieces of\n\ninformation, such as Kosilek's age and excellent disciplinary\n\nrecord, when he advanced his security concerns.\n\n           Another denouement of the district court was that the\n\nsecurity concerns the DOC ultimately proffered (following its hasty\n\nreview) were \"largely false\" and \"greatly exaggerated.\"               This\n\nconclusion was not clearly erroneous. The DOC repeatedly protested\n\n\n                                      -81-\n\fthat transporting Kosilek to surgery out of state would pose an\n\ninsurmountable security risk.         On its face, the concern seems\n\npatently unrealistic.      First, the DOC undoubtedly has a large\n\namount of experience transporting prisoners within and outside of\n\nMassachusetts.      Further, the likelihood of Kosilek, who has been\n\ntransported    to   multiple   doctor's    appointments    without    issue,\n\nfleeing while traveling to receive the surgery that she has\n\ndedicated decades of her life to obtaining is improbable enough\n\nthat we need say nothing more.       Almost equally as unlikely is the\n\nidea that a now sixty-four year old, post-surgical, recovering\n\nKosilek would be able to escape when being transported back to\n\nprison. Even Clarke conceded that it was near certain that the DOC\n\ncould safely transport Kosilek to and from surgery.             On top of all\n\nthis, there was evidence that the surgery might be able to be\n\nperformed in Massachusetts.         An Illinois doctor testified at\n\ndeposition that he would be willing to evaluate Kosilek for surgery\n\nand   travel   to   Massachusetts    to    operate   on   her   if   all   the\n\nappropriate arrangements, such as licensing requirements, could be\n\nmade.\n\n           The DOC's argument that Kosilek's post-operative housing\n\nwould create a security risk is more plausible than its out-of-\n\nstate-transport one, but not enough for us to think the court\n\nclearly erred in not crediting it as a bar to surgery.            Ultimately\n\nthere was evidence of viable housing options for Kosilek.\n\n\n                                    -82-\n\f             Though the DOC claims that housing Kosilek in the general\n\npopulation at MCI-Norfolk or MCI-Framingham is not feasible, the\n\nevidence did not unequivocally support this proposition.       First,\n\nKosilek has been housed safely while living as a woman — wearing\n\nfemale clothing, using female cosmetics, and taking female hormones\n\nthat caused her to develop breasts and a feminine body shape — in\n\nthe general population at MCI-Norfolk for many years. Moreover, in\n\nconnection with Kosilek I, then Commissioner Maloney was adamant\n\nthat there were serious security concerns surrounding Kosilek\n\nremaining at MCI-Norfolk while receiving hormones.        He reasoned\n\nthat many inmates were sex offenders and a prisoner living as a\n\nfemale with female attributes such as breasts would create a risk\n\nof violence.     But once an actual security review was done, then\n\nSuperintendent Spencer reported that there were no current security\n\nconcerns with Kosilek being provided estrogen therapy.         And no\n\nsecurity issues ended up cropping up after that.     The DOC's about-\n\nface calls into question their present stance with regard to the\n\nimpact of surgery.\n\n             Second, with regard to housing Kosilek in the general\n\npopulation at MCI-Framingham, there was evidentiary support for the\n\ncourt's conclusion that the DOC's concerns were bogus or at least\n\noverblown.    For one, the DOC claimed men are stronger than women.\n\nBut Kosilek's perceived superior strength as a man did not jibe\n\nwith her advanced age, physically slight frame, or the fact that\n\n\n                                  -83-\n\fshe has been on female hormones for years.     Moreover, the DOC's\n\nclaim that she would be an escape risk based on the weak perimeter\n\nat MCI-Norfolk is also questionable when one considers Kosilek's\n\nexcellent disciplinary record and the fact that she would, at least\n\ninitially, be a post-operative patient.   And while the DOC pointed\n\nto Kosilek's life sentence as a factor compounding the risk of her\n\nescape, Bissonnette testified that MCI-Framingham already housed\n\naround forty life offenders and gave no explanation why Kosilek\n\nshould be viewed differently from these other lifers.   Finally, in\n\nrejecting the DOC's heightened flight risk contentions if Kosilek\n\nwere housed at MCI-Framingham, the court noted that according to\n\nthe DOC's classification manual, Kosilek's post-crime, one-time\n\npre-arrest flight (a flight embarked on twenty-three years ago)\n\nshould not even have been a consideration, even though Bissonnette\n\nclaimed it was.31\n\n          The potential for Kosilek causing inmate climate issues\n\nat MCI-Framingham due to the fact that she murdered her wife was\n\nanother theory the DOC floated in support of its security concern\n\n\n\n     31\n        According to both Spencer and Bissonnette, Kosilek also\ncould be safely housed in their respective high-security units,\nthough of course that would come with trade-offs for Kosilek as far\nas how restricted her life would be. Obviously Kosilek is aware of\nthose trade-offs and persists in her request for surgery.\n     There was also evidence of another scenario — an out-of-state\ntransfer for Kosilek.    The DOC's only counter to this was the\nspeculative ground advanced by Clarke that there was no guarantee\nanother state would take or keep Kosilek.        But there was no\nevidence that either of these scenarios were explored or probable.\n\n                               -84-\n\fargument.    But the possibility of one inmate being offensive to\n\nanother based on the crime the other inmate committed is not a new\n\nphenomenon, and the evidence was that there were procedures in\n\nplace to deal with these types of situations at MCI-Framingham,\n\nsuch as moving prisoners around.          Not to mention, as Clarke\n\nrecognized, his former employer, the Washington Department of\n\nCorrections, housed a post-operative female transgender inmate,\n\nalso serving a life sentence for murdering a female relation,\n\nwithout security or climate issues.\n\n            Aside from the DOC's purported security concerns, the\n\ncourt pointed to other evidence which it thought suggested the\n\nDOC's denial of surgery was not prompted by valid penological\n\nconcerns but rather a deliberate indifference to Kosilek's medical\n\nneeds. For instance, there was evidence that the DOC did not leave\n\nthings up to chance when it sought an opinion about whether an\n\noperation for Kosilek was even warranted.      The DOC knew before it\n\nretained Osborne that she was assisting other departments of\n\ncorrections in defending litigation filed by transgender prisoners.\n\nIn fact, Hughes specifically noted that Osborne would be more\n\nsympathetic to the DOC's concerns and that she did not believe that\n\nsex   reassignment   surgery   was   appropriate   in   the   corrections\n\nsetting.     It was not a stretch for the court to disbelieve\n\nDennehy's testimony that Osborne's very predictable opposition to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -85-\n\fproviding    Kosilek    with     surgery    did   not   play   a   role    in    her\n\nselection.\n\n             The public disapproval of Kosilek's quest was another\n\npiece of the puzzle.       Even though Dennehy and Clarke denied being\n\nmotivated by avoidance of public controversy, the district court\n\nfound this testimony lacking in credibility and concluded that\n\nDennehy and Clarke were keenly aware of and in fact motivated by\n\nthe outcry.         Evidence supporting the court's finding included\n\nDennehy's press appearance in the news piece featuring her senator\n\nacquaintance who opposed the surgery; Dennehy's testimony that she\n\nwas aware that some politicians were against Kosilek being provided\n\nwith surgery and that she was generally aware of the negative news\n\ncoverage; and Clarke's admission that he received the two letters\n\nfrom the seventeen unhappy state senators and twenty-five unhappy\n\nrepresentatives.\n\n             This    evidence    could     be   conceivably     viewed     as    not\n\noverwhelming in amount. However it was up to the district court to\n\nmake a credibility call, and Judge Wolf did not believe Dennehy's\n\nor Clarke's testimony on the impact of public opinion on their\n\ndecisions.    Credibility calls are something we seldom second guess\n\nin this context.         Rather we give due regard to the judge's\n\nopportunity    to    assess     witness    credibility.        Fed.   R.   Civ    P.\n\n52(a)(6); Monahan, 625 F.3d at 46.                This deference extends to\n\n\"inferences drawn from the underlying facts, and if the trial\n\n\n                                      -86-\n\fcourt's    reading   of   the     record   [with   respect    to     an   actor's\n\nmotivation] is plausible, appellate review is at an end.\" Janeiro,\n\n457 F.3d at 138-39 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration\n\nin original).   Here the district court's impression of Dennehy and\n\nClarke's    motivations     was    certainly    plausible.          Furthermore,\n\nadequate record support for a court's conclusion that \"'deliberate\n\nindifference'    has      been    established      —   or    an     unreasonable\n\nprofessional judgment exercised\" — can exist even though that\n\nindifference \"does not rest on any established sinister motive or\n\n'purpose' to do harm.\"       Battista, 645 F.3d at 455.            It is enough\n\nthat the district court had a reasonable basis for its perception\n\nthat the DOC had shown a pattern of \"delays, poor explanations,\n\nmissteps, changes in position and rigidities.\"                Id.     And as we\n\nchronicled above, there was ample evidentiary support for this\n\nfinding.   Finding no clear error, we defer to the district court's\n\nassessment of Dennehy's and Clarke's testimony and the other\n\nevidence on the issue.\n\n            Finally, the DOC offered one last argument to counter the\n\ncourt's finding of deliberate indifference.             Besides the various\n\nsecurity concerns it alleged, there was a good amount of testimony\n\nfrom DOC officials and experts that it is not wise to give in to\n\ninmate threats of suicide. The fear seems to be that other inmates\n\nwill mimic Kosilek's threats of suicide in order to receive some\n\nbenefit (let's say, desirous medical treatment or a preferable\n\n\n                                     -87-\n\fhousing assignment) based on Kosilek's threats in this case.                      As a\n\ngeneral proposition we agree that the DOC should not have to yield\n\nto   an   inmate's    threats.          However,   we    do    not    see    Kosilek's\n\nparticular suicide issue as quite the concern the DOC makes it out\n\nto be.     First, the evidence was that Kosilek, who had previously\n\nattempted both suicide and self-castration, did not manufacture a\n\nsuicide threat to game the system.              Sadly, it is not unheard of for\n\ninmates suffering from gender identity disorder to engage in self-\n\ndestructive behavior.       See, e.g., Konitzer v.

Second, as far as other inmates are concerned, the DOC\n\nadmittedly employs competent mental health professionals who can no\n\ndoubt assess whether an inmate's threats of suicide are real or\n\nmanufactured.        And   if    they    are    real,   they    can    be    addressed\n\nappropriately on an individualized basis.                      Finally, and more\n\nfundamentally, even though deterring other inmates from potentially\n\nengaging in undesirable behavior may be a valid penal objective, it\n\nis not a reason to withhold medical care that has been deemed\n\nmedically    necessary     for    a     particular      inmate.        Our   ultimate\n\nconclusion: the district court did not err in finding the security\n\n\n                                         -88-\n\frationale submitted by the DOC for not providing Kosilek with\n\nsurgery largely false and greatly exaggerated.\n\n                              VII.

The judge\n\nwas well-placed to make the factual findings he made, and there is\n\ncertainly evidentiary support for those findings.

Lest we lose sight\n\nof the rule that we are called upon to enforce, stretching it\n\nbeyond    the   bounds    of    its   intended     purpose,      it   is    perhaps\n\nappropriate to begin by reciting the text of the Eighth Amendment:\n\n\"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,\n\nnor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"               U.S. Const. amend.\n\nVIII.    In applying any rule, precise demarcation of its reach is\n\nboth    appropriate    and     necessary.       Where    these   boundaries      are\n\nignored, the results are most often unforeseen, unintended, and\n\nunwarranted.      It     is    only   through    careful    attention       to   the\n\ncountervailing interests that prescribe the sweep of a rule that we\n\nare best able to identify both those situations that fall clearly\n\nwithin its bounds, and those complexities that skirt along its\n\noutermost edges.      Such limitations serve more than an exclusionary\n\npurpose; by establishing a rule's proper scope, they ensure the\n\neffectiveness    of    its     protections      when    correctly     and   adeptly\n\napplied.\n\n            With due respect to the majority, I am forced to dissent\n\nbecause I cannot support what is, in my view, an outcome that\n\nproceeds with little recognition of such boundaries.                  Instead, it\n\nallows to stand a decision that, finding its foundation in several\n\nerroneous assumptions, reaches a result beyond the limits of our\n\nestablished Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -91-\n\f                  I. Kosilek's History and Treatment\n\n             Michelle Kosilek (\"Kosilek\") is an anatomically male\n\nprisoner who suffers from severe gender identity disorder (\"GID\").\n\nIn 1992, Kosilek was convicted of murdering her32 wife and sentenced\n\nto life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.            While in\n\nprison,     Kosilek   legally    changed   her   name   from    \"Robert\"   to\n\n\"Michelle\" and began living as a woman to the extent possible\n\nwithin a male prison environment.          Kosilek has previously sought\n\nlegal redress for what she alleged were constitutional shortcomings\n\nin the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's treatment of prisoners with\n\nGID.    See Kosilek v. Maloney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2486110\"><a href=\"/opinion/2486110/kosilek-v-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mass. 2002).\n\nResolved in 2002, this litigation failed to substantiate any Eighth\n\nAmendment violations but ultimately contributed to changes in the\n\ncare and treatment of GID prisoners, including Kosilek.\n\n             Today,   the    Massachusetts   Department    of    Corrections\n\n(\"DOC\") provides Kosilek with a bevy of ameliorative measures aimed\n\nat treating her GID.        These measures, as recommended by the DOC's\n\nmedical     advisors,   include:     psychotherapy,     hormone    therapy,\n\nelectrolysis for facial hair removal, and access to female clothing\n\nand personal items (including underwear and cosmetics) such as\n\n\n       32\n      The district court adopted masculine pronouns in reference\nto Kosilek's anatomical gender. See Kosilek v. Spencer, 889 F.\nSupp. 2d 190 (D. Mass. 2012). Kosilek, however, self-identifies as\nfemale and has undertaken significant efforts, including through\ntreatment provided by the DOC, to formalize this gender\npresentation. I therefore follow the majority's practice of using\nfemale pronouns.\n\n                                    -92-\n\fthose provided to inmates at MCI-Framingham, Massachusetts's only\n\nfemale     prison.         The      DOC's    medical         providers,     Kosilek's\n\npsychiatrist, and Kosilek herself testified as to the positive\n\nimpact these measures have had on her mental state and self-esteem.\n\n            Nonetheless,          the   district       court,   validated    by   the\n\nmajority in this appeal, has now ordered that the DOC provide\n\nKosilek with sex reassignment surgery (\"SRS\") to change her male\n\nsex organs to female.              According to the district court, this\n\nsurgery is the only adequate medical treatment for the serious risk\n\nposed by Kosilek's GID; although Kosilek is not now suicidal, a\n\nfailure to provide the surgery could result in the deterioration of\n\nher   mental     state    and     the   potential      for   future   self-harm.33\n\nConsequently, in the district court's mind, any other treatment --\n\nnamely,    the    continued        provision      of    psychotherapy,      hormonal\n\ntreatments,      and     female    attire,   in     addition     to   treating    any\n\npotential suicidality through antidepressants and increased therapy\n\n-- is violative of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n                           II. The Eighth Amendment\n\n            Fundamental to our understanding of criminal sentencing\n\nand penological standards is the requirement that \"cruel and\n\nunusual punishments [not be] inflicted\" upon those convicted of a\n\ncrime.

The District Court's Conclusions\n\n           In its review, the district court undertook to answer\n\nfive distinct questions which, when answered in the affirmative, it\n\nfound substantiated a constitutional violation deserving of remedy.\n\nThese were: (1) whether Kosilek had a serious medical need; (2)\n\nwhether SRS was the only adequate treatment for that need; (3)\n\nwhether the DOC knew Kosilek was at high risk of serious medical\n\nharm absent SRS; (4) whether the DOC's denial of treatment was made\n\nin bad faith or for pretextual reasons; and (5) whether the DOC's\n\nconduct, if found to be unconstitutional, would continue in the\n\nfuture.\n\n           In my view, by parsing the issue into such discrete,\n\nhermetic questions, the district court's opinion artfully shielded\n\nfrom review the complex and oft-interrelated nature of our Eighth\n\n\n\n     36\n      The majority notes that our court has previously upheld a\nfinding of deliberate indifference where the district court had a\n\"reasonable basis\" for its finding. Battista, 645 F.3d at 455.\nThat same opinion, however, made clear that a finding of deliberate\nindifference was appropriately \"reviewed on appeal more closely\nthan [] district court fact-finding.\"       Id. at 454 (citations\nomitted). While the majority admits of this subtlety, see ante at\n64, its review then appears to abdicate such nuance and apply\nmaximum deference throughout. In any case, where, as here, the\ndistrict court's determinations were infected by various errors as\ndescribed below, I believe the majority presumes too much regarding\ntheir reasonableness.\n\n                                -100-\n\fAmendment inquiry.

In treating\n\nKosilek's contentions, therefore, I adopt our court's past practice\n\nof assessing the district court's \"several subordinate findings\" in\n\na more holistic manner.37 Battista, 645 F.3d at 452. This approach\n\ngives due recognition to the fact that \"[m]edical need' in real\n\nlife is an elastic term,\"   id. at 454, and acknowledges that any\n\ndetermination of a treatment's adequacy must carefully balance the\n\nmany competing concerns faced by prison officials.   I begin with a\n\ndiscussion of the district court's errors, as I see them.\n\nA. Prudent Medical Care\n\n          The district court faced a question about the practice of\n\nprudent medical professionals that, at its crux, hinged on whether\n\nthe DOC's preferred treatment plan -- advocated by Dr. Schmidt --\n\nwas a medically adequate response to Kosilek's GID.    Ultimately,\n\n\n     37\n      That GID is a serious medical condition is not contested.\nFurther, the fifth question need only be reached upon establishing\na constitutional violation, for the purposes of crafting a remedy.\nTherefore, I focus on only the second, third, and fourth questions\npresented.\n\n                              -101-\n\fthe district court, in a decision now upheld by the majority,\n\ndetermined that Dr. Schmidt was not a prudent professional, based\n\nlargely on his statements of equivocation regarding use of the\n\nHarry Benjamin Standards of Care (the \"Standards of Care\" or the\n\n\"Standards\").      Indeed, Dr. Schmidt testified that he viewed the\n\nStandards as \"guidelines.\"         He also made clear that he found the\n\nprotocol laid out on the Standards of Care \"very useful for\n\npatients,\" and that he \"referr[ed] [patients] to the protocol and\n\nask[ed] them to become familiar with them.\" As to SRS, Dr. Schimdt\n\nstated that he \"neither advocate[s] for nor . . . speak[s] against\n\nthe decision[].\" Instead, he \"leaves[s] the decision-making in the\n\nhands of the patients.\"         This is far from what the district court,\n\nnow   affirmed     by    the   majority,   characterizes     as   an   outright\n\nrejection of the Standards' applicability.\n\n             Still, the district court took particular issue with\n\nDr. Schmidt's practice of not writing letters of recommendation for\n\npatients   seeking      surgery.     The   district     court's   concern   was\n\npredicated    on   its    belief   that    letters    of   recommendation   are\n\nrequired by the Standards of Care, and \"[a]ccordingly, prudent\n\nprofessionals . . . write such letters.\"             Kosilek, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\nat 233.    This reasoning contains an inferential leap.            That there\n\nis a predicate requirement to a medical procedure does not lead\n\ninexorably to the conclusion that prudence mandates assisting\n\npatients to meet that requirement.             For instance, if a surgery\n\n\n                                     -102-\n\fcould not be conducted on an individual under a particular age\n\nwithout several letters of recommendation, a medical professional\n\nwho refused to write such a letter based on their understanding of\n\nthat    treatment's    appropriateness        for     youths    would   not   be,\n\nnecessarily, imprudent.\n\n            In   affirming      the    district       court's    finding      that\n\nDr. Schmidt was not prudent, the majority also assigns significant\n\nweight to the fact that, despite having treated approximately 300\n\nindividuals with GID, Dr. Schmidt does not appear to believe\n\nsurgery was ever \"medically necessary.\"               The majority disparages\n\nthis belief as clearly contrary to the Standards of Care, and\n\ntherefore clearly imprudent.          Yet, again, Dr. Schmidt admits to\n\nusing the standards for guidance and to \"maintain[ing] a neutral\n\nposition\" on surgery.        At the request of his patients, he also\n\nreleased medical files to surgeons and wrote letters indicating,\n\nwhere   appropriate,     that   there    were    no    contra-indications       to\n\nsurgery. His testimony regarding his disagreement that surgery was\n\nmedically    necessary    stemmed      from     his    belief    that   patients\n\nexhibiting particularly high levels of distress often suffer from\n\nco-morbid conditions that require treatment in their own right.\n\n            Moreover, the Standards of Care themselves admit of just\n\nthis sort of flexible application, not simply strict adherence.\n\nThe first page of the Standards of Care states unequivocally that,\n\n\"[t]he Standards of Care are Clinical Guidelines;\" it continues on\n\n\n                                      -103-\n\fto make clear that the Standards are \"intended to provide flexible\n\ndirections\"     and   that    \"[a]ll    readers   should    be   aware    of   the\n\nlimitations of knowledge in the area.\"              Standards of Care at 1\n\n(emphasis added).      But see Kosilek, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Standards of\n\nCare further provide that \"[i]ndividual professionals and organized\n\nprograms may modify them.\"         Standards of Care at 2.       This much was\n\nmade clear in Dr. Levine's testimony:\n\n              [T]he \"Standards of Care\" was a consensus\n              document from people from seven different\n              countries or something, you know, who come\n              from different systems, and it was a political\n              process that forged together a set of\n              standards . . . . So \"prudent\" is a wonderful\n              word, but it's not like it has one simple\n              definition.\n\n              In fact, Dr. Levine, who was an independent expert hired\n\nby the district court, expressly stated in his initial report that,\n\nwhile   not     popular,     Dr.   Schmidt's   view   was    within      \"prudent\n\nprofessional standards.\"           In its opinion, however, the district\n\ncourt took significant pains to recast this finding, dismissing it\n\nas erroneous based on Dr. Levine's purported refusal to testify, at\n\nleast initially, as to how a medically prudent professional would\n\nact if all countervailing interests were set aside.                      In other\n\nwords, the court required Dr. Levine to presume that a patient had\n\nfully met all the readiness criteria in the Standards of Care and\n\n                                       -104-\n\ffaced no other extrinsic obstacles to surgery (such as money,\n\nsafety, or external pressure).   The district court then hung its\n\nhat on the fact that, \"[e]liminating these considerations and any\n\nsecurity concerns, Dr. Levine opined that a prudent professional\n\nwould not deny Kosilek sex reassignment surgery.\"   Kosilek, 889 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 235 (emphasis added).\n\n          Medical prudence, however, does not exist in a bubble,\n\nand a standard of minimal adequacy must inherently admit of\n\nconditions that are less than ideal.   See Rhodes v. Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110518\"><a href=\"/opinion/110518/rhodes-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring) (\"[C]ases are not\n\ndecided in the abstract.     A court is under the obligation to\n\nexamine the actual effect of challenged conditions . . . .\").   In\n\nfact, Dr. Levine's testimony recognizes just such nuance -- even if\n\nthe district court's reading of it does not.     Dr. Levine stated\n\nthat while prudent professionals would not deny SRS to eligible\n\nindividuals, \"life, [and] reality\" sometimes would.

I see no merit in this assertion, and moreover\n\nbelieve that it evidences the district court's troublesome practice\n\nof rejecting testimony -- even the testimony of an impartial,\n\ncourt-appointed expert -- where it explored the very real nuances\n\nimplicit in defining prudent care.           For one, the reason for any\n\nsuch \"change\" is clearly evidenced in the record: the district\n\ncourt demanded it. For another, Dr. Levine's testimony, even after\n\nhe was admonished for undertaking an assessment recognizing the\n\nrealities in which GID patients live, was not inconsistent.\n\n          He   began,   in     his   written   report,      by    stating    that\n\nDr. Schmidt's method, while not preferred, was prudent.                In later\n\ntestimony, after specifically predicating his statement with an\n\nacknowledgment   that   \"the    'Standards     of   Care'    []    have     to   be\n\ninterpreted . . . by the life of the environment in which Michelle\n\nKosilek is going to live,\" Dr. Levine again concluded that Dr.\n\nSchmidt's proposed treatment was not \"imprudent.\"                 The following\n\nexchange then occurred:\n\n\nconcern regarding whether a real-life experience -- a key component\nof those Standards -- could occur in prison. See Kosilek, 889 F.\nSupp. 2d at 235. In fact, in combination with the district court's\ninsistence that Dr. Levine ignore questions regarding this real-\nlife experience and instead presume that the experience necessarily\ncan and did occur, this suggests a purposeful tipping of the\ntestimonial scales away from an area of potentially worthy inquiry.\n\n                                     -106-\n\f             THE COURT: But is this an area in which you\n             think prudent professionals can reasonably\n             differ as to what is at least minimally\n             adequate treatment for this condition?\n             [DR. LEVINE]: Yes, and do.\n\nTherefore, in addition to finding no internal inconsistencies in\n\nDr. Levine's expert testimony, see Mitchell v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197865\"><a href=\"/opinion/197865/mitchell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1998), I disagree that he ever testified to\n\nDr. Schmidt's proposed method of care being outside professional\n\nstandards.      At   his   most   negative,   Dr.    Levine   stated   that\n\nDr. Schmidt's proposal would be \"uncompassionate\" and \"unpopular.\"\n\nAt his most mincing, he referred to Dr. Schmidt's proposed method\n\nof care as \"not exactly imprudent.\"39 As such, the district court's\n\nproffered conclusion that Dr. Levine found Dr. Schmidt's proposal\n\nunreasonable is unsupported by the record. Insofar as the majority\n\nnow affirms the same, erroneous reading, I find their conclusion to\n\nbe equally flawed.\n\nB. Serious Risk\n\n             It is undisputed that surgery for Kosilek would be an\n\nappropriate option for treating her GID.            This fact is far from\n\ndeterminative, however, of whether a choice not to provide the\n\nsurgery gives rise to a deprivation of constitutional magnitude.\n\nSee Cameron, 990 F.2d at 20 (finding that prison officials are not\n\n\n\n     39\n      This admittedly unenthusiastic endorsement referenced\nDr. Schmidt's proposed treatment presuming that there was a total\nabsence of countervailing factors to consider in developing a\ntreatment plan.\n\n                                   -107-\n\f\"bound to do what the doctors say is best . . . even if the doctors\n\nare unanimous\").          If an alternative short of surgery is still\n\nsufficient to address, with minimal adequacy, Kosilek's medical\n\nneed, no constitutional claim can arise.              See DeCologero, 821 F.2d\n\nat 43.\n\n               The district court reasoned, however, that any treatment\n\nexcept surgery is necessarily inadequate, given that Kosilek's\n\nmedical providers testified to a likelihood that a denial of\n\nsurgery would significantly increase Kosilek's risk of severe\n\nemotional distress, potentially manifesting in self-harm. Moreover\n\nboth the district court and majority rejected, as violative of the\n\nEighth       Amendment,   the    DOC's    plan   to   treat   any    symptoms   of\n\nheightened        distress      and   suicide    ideation     with    additional\n\npsychotherapy and the possible use of antidepressants.\n\n               This conclusion rests on an artful -- and in my mind\n\nerroneous -- compartmentalization of the DOC's preferred treatment\n\nplan.        The district court seeks to draw a clear line between the\n\ncause of Kosilek's distress (GID) and her symptoms (emotional\n\ndistress and possible suicide ideation).40             In support of the same\n\nreasoning, the majority cites a Seventh Circuit case for the\n\n\n\n        40\n       It is rare, to my understanding, that medical treatments may\nso neatly and completely delineate between symptom and disease.\nCertainly, were a patient to present with signs of both obesity and\nsevere hypertension, it is an uncommon doctor that would disparage\na peer for prescribing blood-pressure medication, although designed\nno doubt to treat a symptom.\n\n                                         -108-\n\fproposition that \"psychotherapy as well as antipsychotics and\n\nantidepressants . . . do nothing to treat the underlying disorder\n\n[of GID].\"    See Fields v.

In contrast, here the question was whether\n\nthe continued provision of all ameliorative measures currently\n\nafforded Kosilek in addition to antidepressants and psychotherapy\n\nwould be constitutionally adequate.\n\n             Indeed, the DOC's proposed method of treating Kosilek's\n\ndistress and desire to self-harm cannot be assessed piecemeal, but\n\nmust be addressed in light of Kosilek's entire course of treatment.\n\nWere   surgery     not    provided,   the     provision   of     psychotherapy,\n\nhormones, electrolysis, and female clothing and cosmetics would\n\ncontinue    to    represent   a   very   real   and   direct     treatment   for\n\nKosilek's GID.      Moreover, although she remains distressed, Kosilek\n\nadmits that the DOC's current treatment regimen has led to a\n\nsignificant stabilization in her mental state.             Kosilek's doctors\n\ntestified    to    the    same,   highlighting    her     \"joy   around   being\n\nfeminized.\"       This claim is also borne out by the long passage of\n\ntime since she exhibited symptoms of suicide ideation or attempted\n\nto self-castrate.        The provision of additional, supplemental care\n\nspecifically targeting her risk of suicide cannot, in my reading,\n\n\n                                      -109-\n\frender    that   treatment,     which   has    successfully     mitigated    her\n\nsymptoms for nearly a decade, suddenly inadequate.41\n\n            What is clear from the record is that the DOC has\n\nprovided Kosilek with care sufficient to decrease her levels of\n\ndistress and manage her desires to self-harm.              On the whole, this\n\nsuggested course of treatment appears tailored to Kosilek's current\n\nsymptoms and adequately prepared to address her future ones in a\n\nmanner    that   is   in   no   way   \"so     inadequate   as   to   shock   the\n\nconscience.\" Torraco v.

The majority affirmed this\n\ndenial; a decision that I believe ignores the very real security\n\nissues presented by the DOC.\n\n           That various security concerns might arise in the context\n\nof a prison setting in which a post-operative, male-to-female\n\ntranssexual is housed with male prisoners takes no great stretch of\n\nthe imagination.42   In fact, nearly every case to consider the\n\nprovision of medical care to prisoners at some point relies on the\n\nSupreme Court's 1994 decision in Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1994).   In that case, an Eighth Amendment claim was predicated on\n\n\n\n     42\n      I find the DOC's concerns regarding Kosilek's post-operative\nhousing significant.    I do not, however, dispute the district\ncourt's finding, affirmed by the majority, that any security\nconcerns regarding Kosilek's ability to escape custody while being\ntransported for surgery are, at best, extremely minimal. Prison\nofficials have significant experience transporting prisoners, and\nboth Kosilek's age and history of good behavior counsel in favor of\nsafe transport.\n\n                               -111-\n\fprison officials' failure to provide (in part through segregation)\n\nfor the safety of a pre-operative transsexual.

The\n\ncourt reasoned that by knowingly allowing the petitioner to remain\n\nin general custody at a male prison despite his feminine body\n\nshape,   clothing,       and    slight         stature,    prison    officials     could\n\nillustrate the sort of subjective indifference necessary to sustain\n\nan Eighth Amendment claim.               Id.\n\n              Despite the obviousness of such risks, the majority\n\nreasons that no clear error occurred, in part because the DOC's\n\nsecurity      review    of     MCI-Norfolk        was     started,    completed,    and\n\nsubmitted in a matter of weeks.                  With speed, it suggests, comes\n\ninadequacy.      I am not so ready to adopt that presumption.                       The\n\nrecord shows that all involved parties met for the first time on\n\nMay 19, 2005, to discuss a report that was due by May 27, 2005.\n\nThat this was their first meeting, however, does not necessarily\n\nmean   that    it   was      the   first       instance     in   which   the   various\n\nindividuals     considered         the    issues     and    questions    implicit    in\n\nensuring a safe environment for prisoners undergoing treatment for\n\nGID.\n\n              The district court and the majority also highlight the\n\nfact that experts retained by the DOC were not wholly knowledgeable\n\nabout Kosilek's personal characteristics, such as age and record of\n\ngood behavior.         Although this shortcoming in their knowledge was\n\nnot ideal, I cannot credit any presumption that these lapses\n\n\n                                           -112-\n\frendered the experts unable or unqualified to speak to the general\n\nsecurity concerns created by housing a post-operative transsexual\n\nin a prison's general population.               Kosilek's record of good\n\nbehavior, for instance, has no bearing on an assessment of whether\n\nother prisoners might threaten or harm her based on her post-\n\noperative anatomy and gender presentation.\n\n           Further, in reaching its conclusion the district court\n\nstated that \"the DOC [could] reasonably assure the safety of\n\nKosilek and others after sex reassignment surgery by housing\n\nKosilek in a segregated protective custody unit.\"           Kosilek, 889 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 243.           Yet, the court also warned that \"it may\n\nforeseeably be argued that keeping Kosilek in segregation is\n\nunnecessary   and    a    form    of   extrajudicial   punishment   that   is\n\nprohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\"            Id. at 245.    The tension\n\nbetween these statements is clear, and the district court's proffer\n\nthat we disregard security concerns based on the existence of a\n\npossibility for segregated housing appears unreasonable when, in\n\nshort turn, they assert that such a course of action would violate\n\nthe Constitution.\n\n           The majority defends the district court's determination\n\nin part by noting that Kosilek may continue to be housed in MCI-\n\nNorfolk's general population where no security issues have arisen\n\nduring her tenure.       The fact that no such issues have arisen in the\n\npast,   however,    does    not   necessarily    render   inappropriate    or\n\n\n                                       -113-\n\funreasonable      the   DOC's    concerns    that     issues   might   present\n\nthemselves in Kosilek's post-operative future.             Certainly, courts\n\ncannot and should not strip from prison officials the ability to\n\nconsider and implement prophylactic solutions to foreseeable issues\n\nreasonably within the scope of their security expertise.               In fact,\n\nsuch a retroactive style of administration would, in itself, seem\n\nto amount to just the sort of indifference to credible threats of\n\nharm that might constitute a constitutional violation.

Giroux, 178 F.3d at\n\n32 (requiring a level of \"excessive risk\" like that of criminal\n\nrecklessness); DesRosiers, 949 F.2d at 19.               Rather, giving due\n\nconsideration to countervailing security concerns and based on a\n\nreview of the record that shows the DOC's proposed care was not\n\noutside the realm of professionalism, I cannot say that the DOC has\n\nfailed to adequately care for Kosilek's GID or callously ignored\n\nher pain.    Feeney v. Corr. Med.

I am convinced, however, that the district court\n\n\n                                   -117-\n\fultimately erred in several key respects, skewing its factual\n\nconclusions towards a result, now upheld by the majority, that is\n\nbeyond the boundaries of our accepted legal precedent.\n\n          The Eighth Amendment proscribes punishment, including\n\npunishment in the form of medical care so unconscionable as to fall\n\nbelow society's minimum standards of decency.

Its\n\nboundary simply does not reach, however, to instances of care that,\n\nalthough not ideal, illustrate neither an intent to harm nor the\n\nobstinate and unwarranted application of clearly imprudent care.\n\nRespectfully, I would reverse.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -118-\n\f</pre>",
