The district court denied relief, and we affirm.\n\n                                          I. Background\n\n       This litigation began over a decade ago in reaction to a legislatively inspired program to\n\nprevent the spread of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Alabama’s prison system.\n\nUnder statute,2 the Alabama prison system tests all entering inmates for infection with HIV, which\n\ncauses AIDS. Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir. 1991).           The Department of\n\nCorrections segregates inmates testing positive for the virus from the general inmate population in\n\nHIV-positive units, one for men at the Limestone Correctional Facility and one for women at the\n\nJulia Tutwiler Prison for Women. Id. at 1500.\n\n       So segregated, the HIV-positive inmates are unable to participate in many programs and\n\nactivities with the HIV-negative, general population. Programs that are available only to the general\n\npopulation program at Limestone include “Double O” squad jobs maintaining the prison grounds,\n\njobs on the prison farm, bus squad jobs, facility maintenance jobs, trash detail jobs, kitchen jobs,\n\nrunner jobs, upholstery classes, electrical technology classes, auto mechanics classes, construction\n\n\n\n   1\n       29 U.S.C. § 794.\n   2\n       Ala. Code § 22-11A-17(a) (1996 Supp.)\n\n                                                 2\n\ftrade classes, automotive body repair classes, horticulture classes, welding classes,3 staff barber jobs,\n\ninmate barber jobs, laundry jobs, gardening jobs in the prison’s vegetable gardens, the “Free by\n\nChoice” program (in which prisoners go to schools to talk to pupils about substance abuse and\n\ncriminality), basketball and baseball tournaments, and “Alabama Volunteers in Corrections”\n\nmeetings (to prepare prisoners for release). Programs that are available separately to Limestone\n\nHIV-positive inmates include paralegal training classes (HIV-positive inmates see videotapes of live\n\ninstruction); adult basic education, GED testing, Narcotics and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,\n\ngraduation ceremonies, drafting classes, haircuts, visitation, medical treatment, gymnasium and\n\nlibrary time, chapel services, dining, and prisoner transportation.\n\n        A similar range of programs is unavailable to HIV-positive inmates at Tutwiler: data\n\nprocessing classes, clerical classes, cosmetology classes, sewing classes, building trades classes,\n\nautomotive repair classes, welding classes, floral design classes, small business machine repair\n\nclasses, quantity foods service classes, nutrition classes, concerts and talent shows, softball and\n\nvolleyball games, the “Free by Choice” program, college classes, Laubach literacy training, sewing\n\nfactory jobs, data processing jobs, “downtown” jobs for government agencies, community projects\n\njobs, road squad jobs, kitchen jobs, yard jobs, maintenance jobs, housekeeping jobs, laundry jobs,\n\ntrash jobs, runner jobs, and haircutting jobs. Like their male counterparts, however, the HIV-\n\npositive prisoners at Tutwiler also have access to many programs separately from the general\n\npopulation: chapel services, some rehabilitation programs such as substance abuse and stress\n\n\n\n   3\n        Correspondence in the months before the 1994 trial between the commissioner of\ncorrections and the commissioner of post-secondary education suggest an intent to offer\nvocational and college classes to HIV-positive inmates separately from the general prison\npopulation. This intent, however, had not been fully realized at the time of trial.\n\n                                                   3\n\fmanagement counseling, visitation, organized recreational activities such as May Day and\n\nOktoberfest, dining, medical care, adult basic education, GED testing, library use, and prisoner\n\ntransportation.\n\n       The plaintiff class challenged this practice of denying some programs to the HIV-positive,\n\nand providing other programs separately, as a violation of several constitutional rights and of § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.4 The district court denied relief after a bench trial. The court\n\nconcluded that no constitutional rights were violated. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1521. It further\n\nconcluded that the plaintiffs were not “otherwise qualified,” as required for rights to arise under §\n\n504, to participate in integrated programs because their participation would pose a significant HIV-\n\ntransmission risk. This court affirmed judgment against the plaintiffs on the constitutional claims.\n\nThis court held, however, that § 504 requires a program-by-program analysis to determine if the\n\nplaintiffs merit relief. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1523. The action was remanded to the district\n\ncourt for this fact-finding. This court directed the district court especially to evaluate\n\nthe risk of HIV transmission in each program in order to determine whether the\n\nplaintiffs were otherwise qualified to participate in each program. In so directing the\n\ndistrict court, the panel nonetheless acknowledged that “the court’s conclusion of the\n\nsignificance of the risk of HIV transmission with regard to each program [could] be\n\nunaltered.” Id. at 1526.\n\n\n\n\n   4\n       Codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1994).\n\n                                                 4\n\f      Measuring the significance of the risk of HIV transmission in a host of\n\nprograms (and thus determining whether the plaintiffs were otherwise qualified to\n\nparticipate) was accordingly the focus of the second trial. One relevant fact was\n\nundisputed: In the state of medical knowledge and art at the time of trial, HIV\n\ninfection inevitably progressed to AIDS. AIDS always led to death, often after\n\nlengthy suffering. But the parties’ evidence and arguments reflected two different\n\napproaches to the problem of measuring risk. Both sides presented substantial\n\nevidence in support of their positions.\n\n      On one hand, the plaintiffs argued that experience teaches us that the odds of\n\nHIV transmission in prison programs are remote at best. Their evidence fell into two\n\ncategories. First, the plaintiffs presented expert testimony that incidents of HIV\n\ntransmission in many activities are rare or virtually unknown. For instance, at the\n\ntime of trial there were no reported cases of transmission as a result of lesbian sex.\n\nThere was a similar lack of reported incidents of transmission from sports injuries,\n\nstabbing, or tattooing. Only “sporadic” instances of transmission from oral sex and\n\nfistfights had been reported. In short, the possibility of transmission in certain unusual\n\ncircumstances (for instance in a fight if both participants bleed copiously into each\n\nother’s wounds, or during barbering if bloody razors are immediately reused) had not\n\nbeen realized in any commonly recurring way.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      Second, however, the plaintiffs’ medical expert had to acknowledge that anal\n\nsex and needle-sharing are high-risk activities. Rather than assert the medical\n\nunlikelihood of transmission from these activities, the plaintiffs presented evidence\n\nof the rarity of such conduct in the programs in which they wish to participate. The\n\nplaintiffs’ prison security expert combed prison files for incident reports and found\n\nnone describing anal sex or needle-sharing during a wide variety of prison programs\n\nat both Limestone and Tutwiler. Reported incidents being rare or unknown in the\n\npast, the plaintiffs reason, we can expect them to be rare or unknown in the future\n\neven if HIV-positive inmates participate in integrated programs. The plaintiffs also\n\nshowed that many of these programs are in high demand, and that inmates therefore\n\nhave every incentive to be on their best behavior; moreover, they point out, the degree\n\nof surveillance in most programs makes an occurrence of anal sex, for instance,\n\nimplausible.\n\n      While not completely contradicting any of this testimony, the defendants\n\nstressed other facts. They introduced testimony that HIV transmission is theoretically\n\npossible, even if not documented, in sports accidents and during fights — wherever\n\nthere is a large exchange of blood between an infected person and an uninfected one.\n\nAnd the defendants introduced evidence that concededly high-risk activity abounds\n\nin prison. This evidence included a six-inch high stack of incident reports from the\n\n\n                                          6\n\fpast few years describing hidden hypodermic needles, homosexual acts, and bloody\n\nfights. The defendants also showed that a 1991 outbreak of syphilis in the HIV-\n\npositive population at Limestone, in which 86 inmates were ultimately treated, was\n\ntraceable to a single inmate. Finally, the defendants offered studies showing that\n\nresidentially integrated prison systems in Maryland, Nevada, and Illinois have\n\nexperienced seroconversions at annual rates of .41% , .19%, and .33%, respectively.5\n\nIn Alabama, by contrast, over the entire roughly eight-year period of entrance and\n\nexit HIV- testing before the time of trial, (see R.31 at 167), only two inmates out of\n\nthe at least 30,000 tested had seroconverted — an all-time rate of .0067%. (See id. at\n\n106 (at least 30,000 inmates tested); id. at 166 (two total seroconverted).) Had the\n\nAlabama seroconversion rates resembled those in Illinois, in the neighborhood of 5\n\ninmates per year would have contracted HIV at Limestone alone, perhaps 40 over an\n\neight-year period.6\n\n       Neither side’s evidence was iron-clad on the points they emphasized. The\n\nplaintiffs undermined the defendants’ evidence of widespread high-risk behavior with\n\nanecdotal evidence of risk-free mixing. The defendants, on the other hand, called into\n\nquestion the plaintiffs’ reliance on the absence of incident reports by offering\n\n  5\n       A “seroconversion” has occurred when an inmate who tested negative for HIV upon\nentering prison later tests positive.\n  6\n       At the time of trial, one of plaintiffs’ experts put Limestone’s population at about 1600.\n\n                                                7\n\ftestimony that much high-risk activity goes unreported, even when discovered, and\n\nthat inmates have developed techniques such as “hot railing” — posting a lookout —\n\nto avoid detection by roving guards. The defendants showed that a runner, who as\n\nsuch held a highly coveted job, forfeited it by engaging in a high-risk act in the HIV-\n\npositive unit. They also offered evidence of a single, sensational incident of high-risk\n\nbehavior committed by two Limestone kitchen workers who engaged in homosexual\n\nsex in the kitchen bakery beside a mixing bowl of peanut butter and jelly.\n\n       The district court generally took the defendants’ view of the facts. The court\n\nmade two significant findings of fact, neither of which the plaintiffs have challenged\n\nas clearly erroneous. The first finding is that sex, intravenous drug use, and bloodshed\n\nare a perpetual possibility in prison whenever a security guard trained to stop it is not\n\nwatching, and that prison life is inherently unpredictable—especially when large-scale\n\nmixing of HIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners in Alabama is untried. The\n\nsecond finding is that HIV is transmitted by sex, intravenous drug use, and blood-to-\n\nblood contact. If these activities can spread HIV, and these activities can occur\n\nbetween HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates, the court reasoned, then HIV\n\ntransmission is more than a theoretical possibility, even if we have no examples.\n\n      From these facts, the court concluded that the transmission risk is significant\n\nin all programs. After all, each case of transmission, however rare, claims at least one\n\n\n                                           8\n\flife. More lives could follow if the infected general-population inmate spreads the\n\nvirus to his cellmates, who in turn spread it farther, as was the case with the 1991\n\nsyphilis outbreak at Limestone. Given this degree of harm, even slim odds of\n\ntransmission make the risk significant. As the court put it in words echoed throughout\n\nits 476-page opinion, “elimination of high risk behavior is impossible. . . . Because the\n\nDefendant/Prison system has decided that such conduct is likely, and because of the\n\ncatastrophic severity of the consequences if such conduct does occur, this Court holds\n\nthat integrating the [program under discussion] would present a significant risk of\n\ntransmitting the deadly HIV virus. Accordingly, the HIV+ inmates are not ‘otherwise\n\nqualified.’” (R.6-532 at 313-314 (emphasis added); accord, e.g., id. at 82, 277-78.)\n\n      The court took this otherwise-qualified analysis one step further. As part of its\n\nevaluation of the plaintiffs’ qualifications to participate in the programs, it weighed\n\nthe Department of Corrections’ penological concerns, including the danger of violence\n\nthat might arise from inmate prejudice toward and fear of HIV-positive prisoners. The\n\ncourt looked to Turner v. Safley, which permits infringement of prisoners’ First\n\nAmendment rights provided that the prison regulation “is reasonably related to\n\nlegitimate penological interests,”7 as a guide to evaluating the Department of\n\nCorrections’ interests. In almost every program, the court concluded that the\n\n\n  7\n      482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987).\n\n                                             9\n\fDepartment of Corrections could legitimately seek to prevent violence and epidemic\n\nHIV by the measures it has taken. In one program, interstate prisoner exchange,8 the\n\ncourt found that penological concerns alone — the cost of medical care for the HIV-\n\npositive — sufficed to excuse the exclusion of HIV-positive inmates.\n\n        The district court continued its analysis, as directed by this court,9 by asking if\n\nreasonable accommodations would make the plaintiffs otherwise qualified. Although\n\nthe court found that in many programs the plaintiffs had already been reasonably\n\naccommodated by provision of identical, but segregated programs,10 the court found\n\nas to other programs that the only reasonable accommodation would be additional\n\nguards to prevent high-risk behavior. The court concluded, however, that hiring the\n\ndozens of guards necessary to integrate all the programs safely would place an undue\n\nfinancial burden on the Department of Corrections.\n\n\n\n\n   8\n        In this program, based on an interstate compact, inmates may serve their terms in another\nstate (for personal reasons, for instance) if that state agrees to send one of its inmates to\nAlabama.\n   9\n        Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1527 (11th Cir. 1991).\n   10\n        These activities included those such as visitation, classes, haircuts, medical treatment,\nsports, and legal research. (R.6-532 at 87 (visitation at Tutwiler); id. at 326 (paralegal training\nclasses at Limestone); id. at. 336 (high-school and college level courses at Limestone); id. at 341\n(GED examination at Limestone); id. at 383 (haircuts at Limestone); id. at 407 (visitation at\nLimestone); id. at 415 (medical treatment at Limestone); id. at 435 (sports at Limestone); id. at\n444 (legal research at Limestone).)\n\n                                                10\n\f        On appeal, the plaintiffs attacked every step of the analysis. On the “otherwise\n\nqualified” issue, they contended that the district court weighed too heavily the gravity\n\nof the harm that could result if these small risks are realized, and that the district court\n\nimproperly took legitimate penological objectives into account. Furthermore, they\n\nargued that the district court erroneously considered the burden on the Department of\n\nCorrections of accommodating all of the plaintiffs’ demands, rather than considering\n\nwhether hiring the few guards necessary to integrate each program would individually\n\noverburden the entire prison system.\n\n        A panel of this court agreed with the plaintiffs on most issues. See Onishea v.\n\nHopper, 126 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir. 1997). The en banc court vacated the panel\n\nopinion, 133 F.3d 1377 (11th Cir. 1998), and now revisits the case with new briefing.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ contentions remain essentially the same and are addressed in turn\n\nbelow.11 These arguments present issues of law and mixed issues of law and fact; both\n\n   11\n        In their en banc briefs — for the first time in the ten-year history of this lawsuit — the\ndefendants claimed Eleventh Amendment immunity. The defendants conceded at oral argument,\nhowever, that the relief the plaintiffs seek plants this case within the fiction of Ex parte Young,\n209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441 (1908), and that the Eleventh Amendment is therefore not an issue in\nthis case.\n        Two other issues can be disposed of in footnote. First, we asked the parties to brief the\nissue whether the Rehabilitation Act applies to prisons at all. The Supreme Court since decided\nthat the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to prisons. See Pennsylvania Dep’t of\nCorrections v. Yeskey, 118 S. Ct. 1952 (1998). We find Yeskey indistinguishable and conclude\nthat the Rehabilitation Act applies to prisons, as well.\n        Second, the plaintiffs complain that the district court excluded evidence concerning\nprograms that would require residential integration. Residential integration — even for program\npurposes — was a matter beyond the scope of the second trial, which was to concern integration\n\n                                                11\n\fare reviewed de novo, although findings of fact stand unless clearly erroneous.\n\nKennedy v. Herring, 54 F.3d 678, 682 (11th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                        II. Discussion\n\n        A.     What is a “significant risk”?\n\n        While not challenging the district court’s findings of fact, the plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the district court misapplied the law and this court’s mandate in determining\n\nwhether they qualify for relief under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In particular,\n\nthey contend that the court wrongly interpreted a “significant risk” of HIV\n\ntransmission to mean “any risk.” We conclude that the district court’s conclusion,\n\nbased on its unchallenged findings of fact, is substantially correct.\n\n        Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, under which the plaintiffs seek relief,12\n\nprohibits discrimination against “otherwise qualified individual[s] with a disability.”\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). An “individual with a disability” does not include “an individual\n\n\n\nof programs. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. We note further that it was the plaintiffs, not the\ndefendants, who objected to introduction of this evidence at trial. (See R.36 at 92 (“Work\nrelease is no longer a part of this case.”).)\n   12\n         As we address more thoroughly in the reasonable-accommodation discussion below,\nthere are potentially applicable agency regulations promulgated under § 504. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R.\nsubpt. G (Department of Justice regulations). Each agency’s regulations, however, generally\napply only to recipients of funds from that agency. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 45.202 (restricting\napplication of Department of Justice regulations to recipients of financial assistance from the\nDepartment of Justice). We cannot tell from the record where the Department of Corrections\ngets its federal funds and thus what regulations apply. We assume for this discussion that any\napplicable regulations would not contradict our analysis of the statute.\n\n                                               12\n\fwho has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such\n\ndisease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other\n\nindividuals.” 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(D). This restriction adopts the Supreme Court’s\n\ninterpretation of § 504 in School Board v. Arline13. Bragdon v. Abbott, 118 S. Ct.\n\n2196, 2210 (1998). Under Arline, the “basic factors” for determining if the carrier of\n\na contagious disease is entitled to § 504’s protection include\n\n       ‘[findings of] facts, based on reasonable medical judgments given the\n       state of medical knowledge, about (a) the nature of the risk (how the\n       disease is transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the\n       carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potential harm\n       to third parties) and (d) the probabilities the disease will be transmitted\n       and will cause varying degrees of harm.’\n\nArline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S. Ct. at 1131 (quoting Br. for American Med. Ass’n as\n\nAmicus Curiae at 19). The Court further directed the courts to “defer to the\n\nreasonable medical judgments of public health officials.” Id.; see also Bragdon, 118\n\nS. Ct. at 2211 (public health authorities’ determinations entitled to “special weight and\n\nauthority”). In short, “[a] person who poses a significant risk of communicating an\n\ninfectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or\n\nher job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk.” Arline, 480 U.S.\n\nat 287 n.16, 107 S. Ct. at 1131 n.16.\n\n\n\n  13\n       480 U.S. 273, 107 S. Ct. 1123 (1987).\n\n                                               13\n\f        We can infer from Arline’s language that the significance of a risk is a product\n\nof the odds that transmission will occur and the severity of the consequences. First,\n\nArline’s four factors include both “the severity of the risk” and “the probabilities the\n\ndisease will be transmitted,” not just the odds the virus will spread. This suggests that\n\neach must interplay with the other in the otherwise-qualified inquiry. Second,\n\nsignificance by itself connotes more than size: “significant” means “deserving to be\n\nconsidered,” “important,” “weighty,” or “notable.” Webster’s Third International\n\nDictionary 2116 (1986). It does not just mean “big.” See id. And it is the potential\n\ngravity of the harm that imbues certain odds of an event with significance. This is\n\nindeed common sense: to borrow an analogy from the district court’s opinion, we are\n\nfar more likely to consider walking a tightrope to pose a significant risk if the rope is\n\nfifty feet high than if it is one foot off the ground. This is so even if the odds of losing\n\nour balance are the same however far we have to fall.\n\n        Thus, when the adverse event is the contraction of a fatal disease, the risk of\n\ntransmission can be significant even if the probability of transmission is low: death\n\nitself makes the risk “significant.” But federal courts disagree about how low the odds\n\nmay be, and how much evidence it takes to prove a significant risk.14 On one hand,\n\n   14\n       The cases cited here concerned suits under both the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act. The Acts’ standards for carriers of contagious diseases are the same. See\nEstate of Mauro ex rel. Mauro v. Borgess Medical Ctr., 137 F.3d 398, 402 (6th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 119 S. Ct. 51 (1998).\n\n                                              14\n\fthe Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have implicitly followed a cautious rule. For\n\nthese courts, a showing of a specific and theoretically sound means of possible\n\ntransmission was enough to justify summary judgment against an HIV-positive\n\nplaintiff on the ground that the infection posed a “significant risk” to others in the\n\nworkplace, even though reported incidents of transmission were few or nonexistent,\n\nand the odds of transmission were admittedly small. See Bradley v. University of Tex.\n\nM.D. Anderson Cancer Ctr., 3 F.3d 922, 924 (5th Cir. 1993) (affirming summary\n\njudgment in favor of a hospital that refused to permit an HIV-positive surgical\n\nassistant to assist surgeries, even though risk was “small”); see Doe v. University of\n\nMd. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1264-65 (4th Cir. 1995) (affirming summary\n\njudgment against HIV-positive physician even though there were no documented\n\ncases of surgeon-to-patient transmission, and hospital itself described risk as “minimal\n\nbut nevertheless ascertainable”); Estate of Mauro ex rel. Mauro v. Borgess Med. Ctr.,\n\n137 F.3d 398, 405, 407 (6th Cir.) (affirming summary judgment against HIV-positive\n\nsurgical technician even though Centers for Disease Control calculated odds of HIV\n\ntransmission during a surgery as between 1 in 42,000 and 1 in 420,000), cert. denied,\n\n119 S. Ct. 51 (1998).\n\n       The First Circuit, on the other hand, has construed the phrase “significant risk”\n\nto mean that not only must the danger be theoretically justifiable, it must also have\n\n\n                                          15\n\fbeen realized in at least several cases. See Abbott v. Bragdon, 107 F.3d 934, 948 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (affirming summary judgment in favor of the HIV-positive plaintiff whose\n\ndentist denied her services, notwithstanding evidence of seven documented cases of\n\npatient-to-dentist HIV transmission; “Dr. Bragdon is not entitled to demand absolute\n\nsafety”), aff’d in part, vacated and remanded in part, 118 S. Ct. 2196 (1998). This\n\ncircuit’s panel precedent arguably anticipates the First Circuit’s view, see Martinez\n\nv. School Bd., 861F.2d 1502 (11th Cir. 1988) (“remote theoretical possibility” of HIV\n\ntransmission through tears, saliva, and urine not significant risk; remand for\n\ndetermination of possibility of blood-to-blood transmission), although limited fact-\n\nfindings make it difficult to determine that case’s standard. The Ninth Circuit\n\narguably anticipated the First Circuit’s position, as well. See Chalk v. United States\n\nDist. Ct., 840 F.2d 701, 709 (9th Cir. 1988) (“[I] t was error to require that every\n\ntheoretical possibility of harm be disproved.”)\n\n       The Supreme Court has reviewed the First Circuit’s judgment in Abbott v.\n\nBragdon, but the Court’s opinion does not resolve the conflict on this question. The\n\nCourt stated no rule, and it neither affirmed nor reversed the First Circuit’s conclusion\n\non this issue. Rather, the Court explained that, “[f]or the most part,” the First Circuit’s\n\nanalysis was correct. Bragdon v. Abbott, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 2211 (1998). The Court\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fthen offered the First Circuit some helpful hints for revisiting the significant-risk issue\n\non remand.\n\n        From these helpful hints, we know that the relevant scientific knowledge is that\n\nat the time of the discrimination, id.; that an unreasonable offer of accommodation\n\nmerits no weight, see id.; that public health statements recommending certain\n\nprecautions are of scant value because they do “not assess the level of risk,” id.; that\n\nprofessional organizations’ opinions may be too intertwined with other matters (such\n\nas ethics) to give objective medical evaluations of risk, see id. at 2211-12; that the\n\ntestimony of health experts may be of some value, see id.; that inconclusive scientific\n\nstudies deserve little weight, see id.; that evidence of seven cases of patient-to-doctor\n\ntransmission is not necessarily sufficient, “standing alone,” to show the risk to be\n\nsignificant, id.; but that all of these observations are qualified by the fact that the\n\nparties did not brief the issue, see id. at 2213. These helpful hints, however, do not\n\nshed much light on the amount or nature of the evidence that is necessary to prove a\n\nrisk to be “significant.”\n\n        In this absence of any clear Supreme Court direction,15 we opt for the position\n\nof the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits. Their cautious approach balances two\n\n\n\n   15\n      On remand, the First Circuit has simply reaffirmed its earlier conclusions. See Abbott v.\nBragdon, 163 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                               17\n\farguably conflicting statutory policies. First, requiring evidence that the asserted risk\n\nof transmission has a sound theoretical basis prevents the Act from overlooking the\n\nunfounded fears and prejudices that Congress meant to uproot. See Arline, 480 U.S.\n\nat 285-87, 107 S. Ct. at 1129-31. Second, the more cautious rule protects federal\n\nfunds recipients from well-founded worries that deaths can result from a ruling that\n\nan HIV-positive plaintiff is otherwise qualified, and thus it avoids the absurd\n\nconclusion that Congress has decreed even a few painful deaths in service of the Act’s\n\nnoble goals. See id. at 287 & n.16, 107 S. Ct. at 1131 & n.16; Southeastern\n\nCommunity College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2367 (1979)\n\n(reversing judgment in favor of a would-be nursing student because her hearing\n\nproblems could impede her performance in emergency situations, thus endangering\n\npatients). Accepting proof of a theoretically possible method of transmission as\n\nsufficient recognizes — unlike the First Circuit’s approach — that saying a risk of an\n\nevent is small does not mean that it will not happen. And each time the event occurs,\n\nit is real people — not cold ciphers — that suffer the consequences. Saying that only\n\none in 42,000 persons will die if exposed to a risk, see Mauro, 137 F.3d at 407, does\n\nnot make that one’s death insignificant.\n\n      We thus hold that when transmitting a disease inevitably entails death, the\n\nevidence supports a finding of “significant risk” if it shows both (1) that a certain\n\n\n                                           18\n\fevent can occur and (2) that according to reliable medical opinion the event can\n\ntransmit the disease. This is not an “any risk” standard: the asserted danger of transfer\n\nmust be rooted in sound medical opinion and not be speculative or fanciful. But this\n\nis not a “somebody has to die first” standard, either: evidence of actual transmission\n\nof the fatal disease in the relevant context is not necessary to a finding of significant\n\nrisk.\n\n        Based on Arline’s standard thus interpreted, the district court’s conclusion was\n\ncorrect. Two of the district court’s unchallenged factual findings support its result.\n\nFirst, the district court found that violence, intravenous drug use, and sex may cause\n\nblood-to-blood contact and happen in prisons in the most unlikely and unexpected\n\nplaces and that it is impossible to know or watch much of what goes on. Second, the\n\ncourt found (based on adequate expert testimony) that blood-to-blood contact, such\n\nas that resulting from anal sex or needle-sharing, likely transmits HIV, and that violent\n\nexchanges of blood raise the specter of transmission. These two findings were enough\n\nfor the court, sitting as fact-finder, to conclude that the risk was significant in any\n\nprogram in which prisoners participate.16\n\n   16\n        The plaintiffs also complain that the district court ignored this court’s earlier mandate to\nassess each program individually. We reject this argument. It is true that the court reached the\nsame conclusion for a host of different programs; but nothing in the earlier mandate required the\ncourt to conclude that the programs were different. See Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1526\n(11th Cir. 1991) (“[I]t may turn out that the court’s conclusion of the significance of the risk of\nHIV transmission with regard to each program will be unaltered.”). The district court’s 476-\n\n                                                 19\n\f        B.     May legitimate penal concerns figure into whether an inmate is\n               otherwise qualified to participate in a program?\n\n        The plaintiffs contend that the district court improperly engaged in the analysis\n\nprescribed by Turner v. Safely, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2261-62 (1987),\n\nto adapt constitutional rights to the prison context. Turner provides four factors to\n\nguide a court’s determination of whether a prison regulation is “reasonably related to\n\nlegitimate penological interests”; if the regulation is, then it escapes constitutional\n\nscrutiny. Id. at 89, 107 S. Ct. at 2261. Those four factors17 served as makeweights to\n\nthe district court’s conclusions here for all the programs, and for one program (the\n\ninterstate prisoner exchange program), the Turner analysis served as the sole basis for\n\ndenying relief.\n\n        We can agree with the plaintiffs’ primary argument that Turner does not, by its\n\nterms, apply to statutory rights. That does not mean, however, that the district court’s\n\nuse of the Turner factors requires vacating its judgment. Section 504’s provisions\n\nextend only to “otherwise qualified individual[s] with a disability.” 29 U.S.C. §\n\n794(a). “An otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of a program’s\n\n\npage opinion, moreover, doggedly reviews the independent evidence for each program.\n   17\n        The four factors are (1) the connection between the prison regulation and a legitimate,\nneutral government interest, (2) the presence or absence of alternatives for the prisoners to\nexercise their claimed right, (3) the effect of unfettered exercise of the right on other inmates,\nguards, and the allocation of prison resources, and (4) the presence or absence of ready\nalternatives. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, 107 S. Ct. at 2262.\n\n                                                 20\n\frequirements in spite of his handicap.” Southeastern Community College v. Davis,\n\n442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2367 (1979). What the “requirements” of a\n\nprogram are is an issue of fact. See, e.g., Majors v. Housing Auth., 652 F.2d 454, 458\n\n(5th Cir. Unit B Aug. 3, 1981) (vacating summary judgment because of genuine issue\n\nof material fact).\n\n       The district court was entitled to find on this record — it indeed seems obvious\n\n— that the requirements for participation in prison programs are determined in part\n\nby the same “legitimate penological interests” that Turner respects in the First\n\nAmendment context. Security is one such legitimate interest. Turner and its\n\nantecedents indeed so recognize. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 91, 107 S. Ct. at 2262-63;\n\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 546, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1878 (1979) (“[M]aintaining\n\ninstitutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential . . . .”);\n\nJones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 132, 97 S. Ct.\n\n2532, 2541 (1977) (“The interest in preserving order and authority in the prisons is\n\nself-evident.”); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823, 94 S. Ct. 2800, 2804 (1974)\n\n(“[C]entral to all other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal\n\nsecurity within the corrections facilities themselves.”); Procunier v. Martinez, 416\n\nU.S. 396, 412-13, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 1811 (1974) (“the legitimate governmental interest\n\nin the order and security of penal institutions justifies the imposition of certain\n\n\n                                            21\n\frestraints”). Penological concerns such as security and cost are legitimate, and the\n\nevidence in this case shows that these are in fact the concerns behind the program\n\nrequirements that participating prisoners neither create a threat of disorder or\n\nunreasonable costs. Thus, even if the district court’s importation of Turner’s\n\nstandards into the Rehabilitation Act was not precisely correct as a matter of legal\n\ntheory, determining whether penological concerns impose requirements for program\n\nparticipation is not error. See Crawford v. Indiana Dep’t of Corrections, 115 F.3d\n\n481, 487 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\n      While not conceding that Turner-like factors are properly considered at all, the\n\nplaintiffs also argue that the district court misapplied Turner first by making a clearly\n\nerroneous finding that integrating programs would risk violence, and second by\n\nconcluding that the Department of Corrections’ segregation policy is not an\n\nexaggerated response to the problem of prison security and slowing the virus’s spread.\n\n      We reject both arguments. The district court’s finding as to the risk of HIV-\n\nrelated violence was, as the plaintiffs point out, based on conflicting evidence. The\n\ndefendants offered a study of inmate opinion that was both off-point (it asked for\n\nviews on residential integration, not program integration) and six years old at the time\n\nof trial. But the plaintiffs did not do much better; they offered only anecdotal\n\nevidence of peaceful intermingling between HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates.\n\n\n                                           22\n\fIf two findings were possible here — risk of violence from intermingling or no risk\n\nof violence from intermingling — both required drawing a series of inferences from\n\nthe parties’ scant evidence. The district court chose to infer from the defendants’\n\nstudy (1) that residential and program integration would be equally objectionable to\n\ncertain inmates and (2) that inmate opinion had remained substantially unchanged\n\nover a six-year period. To make the finding plaintiffs urged, the district court would\n\nhave had to infer at least (1) that the HIV-negative inmates involved in peaceful\n\nintermingling represent the unanimous sentiment among HIV-negative inmates and\n\n(2) that special circumstances surrounding the intermingling did not contribute to the\n\npeacefulness. The district court’s choice of the former inferences over the latter ones\n\nis not clearly erroneous.\n\n      The court’s conclusion that the response is not exaggerated, moreover, properly\n\nfollows Turner’s guidance. (The plaintiffs do not contend that Turner’s “exaggerated\n\nresponse” analysis in particular is inappropriate for Rehabilitation Act otherwise-\n\nqualified analysis.) Turner compels a conclusion that a response is exaggerated only\n\nwhen the inmate produces evidence of “easy alternatives” that come at a de minimis\n\ncost to valid penological interests. Turner, 482 U.S. at 91, 107 S. Ct. at 2262. The\n\nplaintiffs’ proposed “easy alternative” is to exclude from programs the prisoners who\n\nmight react violently to integration. The record does not support the ease of this\n\n\n                                          23\n\falternative, which would apparently require the Department of Corrections to evaluate\n\nthe attitudes and predict the behavior of every program participant. The district court\n\ncould correctly conclude that segregated programs are not an exaggerated response\n\nto the problem of violence.\n\n      In sum, then, we conclude that the district court could properly use factors such\n\nas Turner’s to determine whether the plaintiffs were otherwise qualified to participate\n\nin the programs. The district court’s analysis of those factors, moreover, was\n\nsubstantially correct.\n\n      C.     Did the district        court     appropriately   evaluate   “reasonable\n             accommodations”?\n\n      The Harris panel directed the district court on remand to consider whether\n\nreasonable accommodations would permit the plaintiffs to participate in any of the\n\nprograms at issue. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. The district court did so and\n\nconcluded in most programs that the proposed accommodations, which mostly\n\nconsisted of hiring additional guards to prevent high-risk behavior, would impose an\n\nundue burden on the prison programs. The plaintiffs challenge the district court’s\n\nconclusions on four grounds.\n\n      Before we get to the specific challenges, however, we have to point out that we\n\nare not construing any law whose source we may clearly identify. This is because the\n\nreasonable-accommodation principle (that a disabled person is entitled to participate\n\n                                          24\n\fin a program, notwithstanding lack of qualification, if a reasonable accommodation\n\nwould qualify him) does not appear in § 504. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 706, 794. The\n\nprinciple appears, rather, in agency regulations promulgated under the statute’s\n\nauthority. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 42.511(a) (Department of Justice); 29 C.F.R. § 32.13\n\n(Department of Labor). The applicability of these regulations as a general rule\n\nfollows federal funding from an agency. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 42.502; 29 C.F.R. §\n\n32.2(a). Unfortunately, the district court denied the plaintiffs discovery of the source\n\nof the Department of Corrections’ federal funding, and the plaintiffs did not pursue\n\nquestioning on this subject at trial. Thus, with one exception,18 we do not know what\n\nregulations apply to the Department of Corrections. And this matters: Different\n\nagency regulations lay out the contours of the reasonable-accommodation principle\n\ndifferently.     For instance, Department of Justice regulations require no\n\naccommodation at all in nonemployment programs, see 28 C.F.R. § 42.540(l)(2),\n\nwhile Department of Labor regulations require reasonable accommodation in\n\nemployment training programs, see 29 C.F.R. § 32.13(a).\n\n\n\n\n   18\n        We know that the Department of Labor contributes funds to the Department of\nCorrections’ adult basic education programs. (See R.26 at 223.) Those programs, therefore, fall\nunder Labor regulations, but the regulations by their own terms do not extend beyond that\nprogram. See 29 C.F.R. § 32.2(a) (“This part applies to each recipient of Federal financial\nassistance from the Department of Labor . . . but is limited to the particular program for which\nFederal financial assistance is provided.”)\n\n                                               25\n\f      Our ignorance of what law controls has not, however, been troubling to any\n\nparty; the parties briefed the question only upon order of this court. Nor was it\n\ntroubling to the Harris panel. See Harris, 941 F.3d at 1547. Rather than disturb what\n\nhave become the parties’ settled expectations, therefore, we elect to apply some sort\n\nof least-common-denominator reasonable-accommodation principle, and we assume\n\nfor present purposes (notwithstanding some arguably contrary regulations) that the\n\nreasonable-accommodation principle applies to all the programs under discussion. Cf.\n\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-04, 105 S. Ct. 712, 719-20 (1985) (construing\n\nthe statute without the aid of apparently applicable regulations). But in doing so, we\n\nkeep in mind that regulations issued under statute control the interpretation of the\n\nstatute as long as the interpretation is permissible. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782\n\n(1984). We thus look to some regulations for guidance, but our interpretation here\n\nwould not trump any agency regulation that interprets § 504 differently.\n\n      One further caveat: we acknowledge that the Harris panel sensibly concluded\n\nthat differences among the programs in which the plaintiffs seek to participate\n\nrequired different analyses. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. In this court, however, the\n\nplaintiffs have painted their reasonable-accommodation arguments with a broad brush,\n\nand we follow their lead in explaining our rulings.\n\n\n                                         26\n\f               1.    Was classifying high- and low-risk prisoners an accommodation\n                     open to consideration?\n\n         One reasonable accommodation that the plaintiffs proposed was for the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to refine existing systems of inmate classification to detect\n\nHIV-positive inmates who were highly unlikely to engage in high-risk behavior and\n\nto permit those inmates to participate in integrated programming. At trial, however,\n\neach time the defendants objected to classification evidence, the court excluded it on\n\nthe reasoning that any evidence tending to be about individual inmates — even if the\n\nevidence concerned inmate classification systems in general — was outside the scope\n\nof the retrial mandated by this court. For the same reason, the court implied that it\n\nwould not consider the evidence or the argument. The plaintiffs contend that both the\n\nexclusion of evidence and the refusal to consider the evidence in the bench trial was\n\nerror.\n\n         We agree with the plaintiffs that consideration of this proposed accommodation\n\n(and, therefore, evidence of it) was within the mandate. The Harris panel directed the\n\ndistrict court to consider reasonable accommodations, see Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527,\n\nand this argument and evidence was about classifying all the class members for access\n\nto particular programs. The district court should not, therefore, have excluded the\n\nplaintiffs’ evidence about classification, and it should have considered classification\n\nas a reasonable accommodation.\n\n                                           27\n\f        But this conclusion does not mean that reversal is required. The defendants did\n\nnot always object to classification evidence, and throughout the trial the plaintiffs\n\nwere allowed to introduce substantial evidence about the classification process at the\n\nDepartment of Corrections (including the Department of Corrections’ inmate\n\nClassification Manual) and about classification’s potential effectiveness.19 Thus, the\n\ncourt’s evidentiary ruling did not prevent the plaintiffs from making a classification\n\nargument. Furthermore, while the court implied at trial that it would not consider\n\nclassification as an accommodation, the court’s findings of fact make clear that it did\n\nconsider classification, if only implicitly.           The court found that inmates are\n\n“untrustworth[y],” “volatil[e],” “unpredictable,” and subject to “great pressures from\n\nconflicting sources.” (R.6-531 at 56, 57.) Therefore, the court found, prison officials\n\nmust always “prepare[] for the worst” and “expect the unexpected.” (Id. at 57, 58.)\n\nThese findings are an implicit rejection of plaintiffs’ argument.              If prisoners are\n\ninherently “unpredictable,” as the district court found, then classification is not a\n\nreasonable way of integrating programs, because it does not reduce the risk of HIV\n\ntransmission.\n\n\n\n   19\n        (See, e.g., R.25 at 67-69; id. at 74; id. at 143-45 (Department of Corrections\nClassification Manual admitted as Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 1); R.27 at 127 (“cherry-picking” inmates\nis sound penological strategy); R.32 at 229 (“job board” classification system); R.34 at 210-213\n(classification procedure); R.35 at 208-230 (great detail concerning classification process).)\n\n                                               28\n\f      Because the plaintiffs thus did in fact successfully introduce classification\n\nevidence, and the district court implicitly considered the feasibility of classification,\n\nthe plaintiffs’ substantial rights were not affected by the court’s trial rulings, and no\n\nremand is required. Cf. Deviner v. Electrolux Motor, AB, 844 F.2d 769, 774 (11th Cir.\n\n1988) (exclusion of certain evidence not reversible error when similar evidence\n\n“leaked” through the exclusion).\n\n             2.     May excessive cost make a hardship undue?\n\n      Reasonable accommodations are mandatory only to the point that they impose\n\n“undue hardship” on the federal funds recipient. See, e.g., 29 C.F.R. § 32.3 (definition\n\nof “reasonable accommodation”); see also Willis v. Conopco, 108 F.3d 282, 286 n.2\n\n(11th Cir. 1997). The plaintiffs’ primary proposed accommodation was for the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to hire enough guards to surveil the programs and prevent\n\nhigh-risk behavior. The district court found that the plaintiffs’ recommended level of\n\nsecurity staffing to be too low to prevent high-risk behavior, but implied that the\n\nDepartment of Corrections’ claimed necessary level of staffing—as many as 70\n\nadditional guards all together, a 23% increase—would adequately reduce the risk.\n\nThis level of staffing, the court concluded, would place an undue financial and\n\nadministrative burden on the already-strapped prison system.\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f      In challenging this conclusion, the plaintiffs complain primarily that the district\n\ncourt should not have considered cost at all. The plaintiffs cite Zimring v. Olmstead,\n\n138 F.3d 893 (11th Cir.), cert. granted, 67 U.S.L.W. 3402 (Dec. 17, 1998), for the\n\nproposition that only expenditures that would “fundamentally alter the service”\n\nprovided can impose an undue hardship on the federal fund recipient. Id. at 905\n\n(interpreting Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act). According to the\n\nplaintiffs, the defendants did not carry their burden of proving that the addition of 70\n\nguards would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the programs to which the plaintiffs\n\nseek access, and that cost could not, therefore, have been an undue burden.\n\n      We reject the plaintiffs’ argument both because Zimring’s standard does not\n\napply here and because the district court’s findings are supported by sufficient\n\nevidence. Under the Rehabilitation Act, cost is relevant to the federal fund recipient’s\n\nburden when it, like any other burden, reaches the point of “undue hardship.” This\n\nis a consistent agency interpretation of the statute: Many (if not all) regulations\n\npromulgated under the Rehabilitation Act prescribe “undue hardship” as the standard\n\nfor measuring when the federal funds recipient’s burden is too much. See, e.g., 7\n\nC.F.R. § 15b.13(a) (Department of Agriculture); 28 C.F.R. § 42.511(a) (Department\n\nof Justice); 29 C.F.R. § 32.13(a) (Department of Labor); 34 C.F.R. § 104.12(a)\n\n(Department of Education); 45 C.F.R. § 84.12(a) (Department of Health and Human\n\n\n                                          30\n\fServices). And in all these regulations, determining “undue hardship” explicitly\n\nfactors in “the nature and cost of the accommodation.” 7 C.F.R. § 15b.13(b)(3); 28\n\nC.F.R. § 42.511(c); 29 C.F.R. § 32.13(b); 34 C.F.R. § 104.12(c); 45 C.F.R. § 84.12(c).\n\n      This circuit’s precedents, moreover, show that a hardship becomes undue long\n\nbefore it effects a “fundamental alteration” in employment conditions or reallocation\n\nof program resources. See, e.g., Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th\n\nCir. 1994) (undue hardship for hospital to schedule around a janitor’s unpredictable\n\nabsences, which had occurred six times in two and a half months); Severino v. North\n\nFort Myers Fire Control Dist., 935 F.2d 1179, 1183 (11th Cir. 1991) (“Evenhanded\n\ntreatment of employees in a covered program does not require an institution to lower\n\nor effect substantial modification of standards to accommodate a handicapped\n\nperson.”); Treadwell v. Alexander, 707 F.2d 473, 478 (11th Cir. 1983) (undue\n\nhardship for park to accommodate heart-bypass patient by assigning demanding tasks\n\nto the two to four other park employees of the same rank who worked the same shift).\n\nRequired accommodations, on the other hand, have demanded little from federal fund\n\nrecipients in either money or other resources. See, e.g., Majors v. Housing Auth., 652\n\nF.2d 454, 458 (5th Cir. Unit B Aug. 3, 1981) (public housing complex could be\n\nrequired to permit exception to “no pet” rule to accommodate mentally unstable tenant\n\nwho needed a dog); Tatro v. Texas, 625 F.2d 557, 564 n.19 (5th Cir. 1980) (school\n\n\n                                         31\n\fcould be required to train teachers to catheterize little girl with no urinary control,\n\nwhen procedure took only a few minutes every three hours).\n\n        These regulations (some of which we assume apply here for the reasons\n\nexplained above) and precedent do not fix a bright-line rule, but they do make clear\n\nthat a financial burden may become too much when it reaches the point of “undue\n\nhardship.” And the district court did not clearly err in so finding here. Limestone’s\n\nwarden estimated that he would need around 25 additional officers to guard integrated\n\nprograms; Tutwiler’s warden estimated that she would need as many as 45 additional\n\nofficers to integrate all programs safely.20 The record shows that the cost of these 70\n\nadditional officers for their first year would be $1,713,810. The budget for the entire\n\nDepartment in fiscal 1994 was $163,000,000.                At the time of trial, this level of\n\nfunding left Limestone 35 correctional officers short and Tutwiler 89 short. The court\n\ncould conclude that in these circumstances spending an addition $1.7 million would\n\ncause undue hardship.\n\n        The plaintiffs assert to the contrary that their evidence of the Department of\n\nCorrections’ power to reallocate resources required the opposite conclusion. We\n\ndisagree, because the plaintiffs’ reliance on the Department’s authority to reallocate\n\n\n\n   20\n       There was testimony that because of vacation and sick time it takes 1.73 officers to fill\none eight-hour post; it is not clear if the wardens’ estimates were of posts or actual officers.\n\n                                                32\n\fresources rests on a legal equation of “undue hardship” with “impossibility.” As\n\nexplained just above, that is not the standard. The Rehabilitation Act does not require\n\nthe Department to do whatever it is legally capable of doing to accommodate the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n              3.    May a court consider the global burden of accommodations\n                    requested in different areas?\n\n       Here, the plaintiffs argue that the district court wrongly considered the burden\n\nto the Department of Corrections of accommodating the plaintiffs in every program\n\nthat required additional security to operate safely. According to the plaintiffs, the\n\ndistrict court should have picked and chosen among programs, selecting some for\n\naccommodations that, because of their smaller scale, would not be unduly\n\nburdensome. We reject this argument. While it may be true, as the plaintiffs assert,\n\nthat “[n]othing in § 504 permits federal funds recipients to take this ‘all or nothing’\n\nstand,” it was not the federal funds recipient here but the plaintiffs who insisted on\n\nhaving everything. The plaintiffs’ post-trial brief, for instance, made this argument\n\nwithout specifically identifying any programs that the plaintiff preferred to integrate\n\nover others, and the Complaint asks for integration in all programs. It was incumbent\n\non the plaintiffs, not the defendants or the court, to identify where they wanted partial\n\nrelief, if full relief were not possible. Cf. Blessing v. Freestone, 117 S. Ct. 1353,\n\n1360-62 (1997) (plaintiffs obligated to particularize claims for relief).\n\n                                           33\n\f                4.     Can providing “separate but equal” programs be a reasonable\n                       accommodation?\n\n          The plaintiffs’ fourth challenge to the court’s analysis we need not discuss in\n\ndetail.     They complain that the district court ruled that “separate but equal”\n\nprogramming — those programs such as adult basic education that were afforded both\n\nHIV-positive and -negative prisoners separately — is not a proper accommodation of\n\na disability. This argument is apparently new on appeal. Indeed, before the district\n\ncourt, the plaintiffs argued somewhat inconsistently that “separate but equal”\n\naccommodations were not only permissible under the Rehabilitation Act, but required\n\nby it. (R.5-526, at 161-62.) We decline to consider this newly raised issue.\n\n                                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s judgment is affirmed.21\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n   21\n        In addition to their other arguments, the plaintiffs accuse Judge Varner, the district judge\nhere, of impropriety and assert that Judge Varner should have recused himself. In the\nalternative, they argue that the case should be reassigned on remand. We conclude that the\nevidence of impropriety is insufficient to warrant recusal and vacatur of the judgment; we need\nnot consider reassignment because we do not remand.\n\n                                                 34\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting, in which HATCHETT, Chief Judge, joins:\n\n      The issue before the court today is not an easy one. Prisons certainly have the\n\nobligation to prevent the spread of the HIV virus among inmates. At the same time\n\nthey have the obligation to protect the rights of prisoners already infected with the\n\nvirus. This difficult balancing act requires sensitivity to the rights of all prisoners\n\nwithin the state’s custody – both those infected with the disease and those who are not.\n\nBy upholding on this record Alabama’s policy of excluding HIV+ inmates from all\n\nthe programs and activities offered to inmates housed in the general population, the\n\nmajority permits Alabama to forego any consideration of the rights of HIV+ inmates\n\neven where the rights of uninfected inmates are not, in any real sense, endangered.\n\nThe majority upholds the blanket exclusion on the grounds that any cognizable risk\n\nof HIV transmission, no matter how infinitesimal and even if based on a wholly\n\nunlikely and speculative chain of events, suffices to disqualify HIV+ inmates from\n\nparticipating in all general population prison programs and that no reasonable\n\n\n                                          35\n\faccommodation could eliminate this risk. The majority’s holding is in direct conflict\n\nwith governing Supreme Court precedent and eviscerates § 504’s protections.\n\nMoreover, in affirming the judgment of the district court, the Court places its\n\nimprimatur on the district court’s failure to conduct a discrete analysis of the risk of\n\nHIV transmission in each of the many programs and activities at issue here in\n\nderogation of the specific mandate of this court. As a result, HIV+ inmates in\n\nAlabama are excluded from participating in a whole host of programs to which\n\nuninfected inmates routinely have access – programs and activities which comprise\n\nvirtually all features of institutional life – without any meaningful inquiry into whether\n\nthis stigmatizing exclusion is necessary to protect uninfected inmates from a\n\nsignificant risk of HIV transmission. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n      In School Board of Nassau County, Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), the\n\nSupreme Court made clear that recipients of federal aid are not entitled to demand\n\nabsolute segregation from individuals with contagious diseases; § 504 prohibits those\n\nreceiving federal moneys from unduly indulging their fears and requires them to\n\ntolerate less than significant risks of transmission. In Arline, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat a school teacher who was diagnosed with tuberculosis was a handicapped\n\nindividual within the meaning of § 504 and remanded the case for an “individualized\n\ninquiry” as to whether Arline could serve as a teacher without posing a significant risk\n\n\n                                           36\n\fof communicating her disease to her students. Id. at 287. Observing that “[f]ew\n\naspects of a handicap give rise to the same level of public fear and misapprehension\n\nas contagiousness,” the Court explained that § 504 was “carefully structured to replace\n\nsuch reflexive reactions . . . with actions based on reasoned and medically sound\n\njudgments. . . . The fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose\n\na serious health threat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding\n\nfrom the coverage of the Act all persons with actual or perceived contagious\n\ndiseases.” Id. at 284-85 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the Court held that an\n\nindividualized inquiry into risk was “essential if § 504 is to achieve its goal of\n\nprotecting handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes,\n\nor unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of\n\ngrantees as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.” Id. at 287.\n\n      In formulating the “significant risk” standard, the Court explained that “[a]\n\nperson who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others\n\nin the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable\n\naccommodation will not eliminate that risk.” Id. at 287 n.16. The Court instructed\n\nlower courts to look to objective medical evidence concerning four factors in\n\ndetermining whether a risk is significant: “(a) the nature of the risk (how the disease\n\nis transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the carrier infectious), (c) the\n\n\n                                            37\n\fseverity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third parties) and (d) the probabilities\n\nthe disease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm.” Id. at 288.\n\n\n\n       Focusing exclusively on Arline’s third factor, the majority holds that, because\n\nof its deadly consequences, any cognizable risk of HIV transmission is, as a matter of\n\nlaw, a significant risk. The majority purports to apply Arline, stating that “the\n\nsignificance of a risk is a product of the odds that transmission will occur and the\n\nseverity of the consequences,” Maj. op. at 13, but then proceeds to ignore all but the\n\nseverity of risk factor. The fatal consequences of a contagious disease, in the\n\nmajority’s view, suffice to render a transmission risk significant even if the\n\nprobabilities of transmission are so low as to approach zero, so long as transmission\n\ncould theoretically occur, letting one factor overwhelm the entire Arline analysis.\n\nAlthough it disclaims any intent of establishing an “any risk” standard, in fact the\n\nmajority opinion does exactly that. By focusing only on possibilities – whether “a\n\ncertain event can occur” and whether “the event can transmit the disease,” Maj. op.\n\nat 16 (emphasis added) – the majority requires a plaintiff to prove that transmission\n\nis impossible. This reasoning conflicts with Arline’s explicit directive to consider\n\nother relevant factors and is directly contrary to the Supreme Court’s recent decision\n\nin Bragdon v. Abbott, 118 S. Ct. 2196 (1998).\n\n\n                                            38\n\f       In Bragdon, the Court considered whether a dentist could refuse to treat an\n\nHIV+ patient based on the risk of transmission of the HIV virus. It bears noting that\n\nthe Supreme Court specifically rejected the very argument the majority adopts today.\n\nBragdon declined to permit discriminatory treatment of those afflicted with the HIV\n\nvirus based on an “any risk” standard, explaining that “[b]ecause few, if any, activities\n\nin life are risk free, Arline and the ADA do not ask whether a risk exists, but whether\n\nit is significant.” Id. at 2210. Thus, the “significant risk” analysis begins with the\n\nexistence of a risk of transmission, but it does not end there. “The question under the\n\nstatute,” the Court stated, was “one of statistical likelihood” based on an “objective\n\nassessment of the risks posed . . . .” Id. at 2211-12. Indeed, in Bragdon, the Court\n\nrejected the dissent’s argument that a significant risk of HIV transmission existed\n\nbased on instances of possible transmission of HIV from patients to dental and other\n\nhealthcare workers, finding that this evidence of possible transmission was\n\ninsufficient to establish “the objective, scientific basis for finding a significant risk to\n\nthe petitioner.” Id. at 2212. See also Abbott v. Bragdon, 163 F.3d 87, 89-90 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (reaffirming conclusion that seven cases of possible transmission were\n\ninsufficient to establish significant risk).      The majority wholly ignores these\n\nprinciples, failing to recognize Bragdon’s distinction between “any risk” of HIV-\n\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\ftransmission and a “significant risk,” and offers no reason why Bragdon should not\n\nbe applied here.\n\n      This Circuit has, until today, declined to sanction segregation of those with HIV\n\nor AIDS based on an “any risk” standard. In Martinez v. School Bd. of Hillsborough\n\nCounty, Fla.., 861 F.2d 1502 (11th Cir. 1988), a case summarily dismissed without\n\nany analysis by the majority, we considered whether, consistent with the dictates of\n\n§ 504, a mentally retarded girl with AIDS could be provided schooling in a segregated\n\nsetting to avoid the transmission of her disease to her classmates. Applying Arline,\n\nwe rejected the district court’s conclusion that a “remote theoretical possibility” of\n\ntransmission through tears, saliva, and urine were sufficient to support segregated\n\nschooling. This possibility, we explained, “does not rise to the ‘significant’ risk level\n\nthat is required for Eliana to be excluded from the regular . . . classroom.” Id. at 1506.\n\nDespite the lethal consequences of the plaintiff’s AIDS, we found that the risk of\n\ntransmission occurring in this manner was too remote and speculative to constitute a\n\n“significant risk” under Arline. See also Doe v. DeKalb County School Dist., 145\n\nF.3d 1441, 1446 (11th Cir. 1998) (remanding to permit the district court to “explain\n\nwhy it believes that the risk posed by Doe is ‘remote’” under Martinez and to “make\n\nfindings of fact with respect to the Arline factors”).\n\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\f      I recognize that sex and needle sharing have been established as pathways of\n\nHIV transmission. However, different programs present different levels of risk of\n\nsuch behavior occurring. The prior mandate of this court recognized this distinction\n\nby requiring that the district court evaluate each program in terms of the risks\n\ninvolved. For example, the risks of residential integration differ from the risks of\n\nintegrating a religious service or an educational class. Even where an established\n\ntransmission pathway is involved, a risk of HIV transmission must be evaluated on\n\nobjective evidence of the likelihood of transmission and the other Arline factors, not\n\non mere speculation. Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, this standard does not\n\ndemand that someone die before a risk is considered significant. It does, however,\n\ndemand both evidence that particular conduct will transmit the disease and a\n\nreasonable likelihood that the conduct will actually take place in the particular\n\nprogram at issue. See Estate of Mauro v. Borgess Medical Ctr., 137 F.3d 398, 402-03\n\n(6th Cir.) (because “neither [the Rehabilitation Act nor the ADA] requires the\n\nelimination of all risk posed by a person with a contagious disease . . . our analysis\n\n. . . must not consider the possibility of HIV transmission, but rather focus on the\n\nprobability of transmission weighed with the other three factors of the Arline test”)\n\n(emphasis in original), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 51 (1998); id. at 409 (Boggs, J.,\n\ndissenting) (“[T]he ‘significance’ of risk inescapably involves a judgment about the\n\n\n                                          41\n\fprobabilities of harm”); Chalk v. United States Dist. Ct., 840 F.2d 701, 709 (9th Cir.\n\n1988) (holding that “it was error to require that every theoretical possibility of [HIV\n\ntransmission] be disproved”); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2 at 56 (1990), reprinted in\n\n1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 338 (noting that “a speculative or remote risk” is insufficient\n\nto support a finding of a “significant risk”); id., pt. 3 at 46, reprinted in 1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 469 (“The plaintiff is not required to prove that he or she poses no\n\nrisk.”). It is one thing to say that objective evidence of a small risk of transmission\n\nof a deadly, contagious disease entails a significant risk in a particular context. It is\n\nquite another to say, as the majority does, that the probability of transmission is\n\nirrelevant so long as transmission is theoretically possible.\n\n      In this case, the district court asked only whether there was a risk of HIV\n\ntransmission, equating a mere possibility of HIV transmission with the significant risk\n\nrequired for exclusion. No separate analysis of each program weighing the different\n\nrisks involved and the likelihood of transmission was conducted to determine whether\n\nplaintiffs were otherwise qualified to participate in any of them. In program after\n\nprogram, the district court concluded that integration would pose a significant risk,\n\nrelying on and repeating verbatim the following paragraph thirty-nine times in the\n\ncourse of its opinion to justify its holding that the HIV+ inmates were not “otherwise\n\nqualified” to participate in any general population programs:\n\n\n                                           42\n\f       The Court of Appeals recognized in Harris, 941 F.2d at 1495, 1519-20\n       that “high risk behavior occurs disproportionately in prison systems” and\n       that “under any system of prison administration, the elimination of high\n       risk behavior, such as homosexual behavior or IV drug use is\n       impossible.” This Court, too, recognizes that elimination of high risk\n       behavior is impossible. There is no guarantee that any conduct will or\n       will not occur in a prison setting. This Court is ill-suited to instruct\n       prison officials on the likelihood of the occurrence of high risk behavior.\n       This Court is even more ill-suited to instruct the prison system on when\n       and how to prevent such conduct when they, along with their managers\n       and medical officials, determine that such conduct is likely. Because the\n       Defendant/Prison system has decided that such conduct is likely, and\n       because of the catastrophic severity of the consequences if such conduct\n       does occur, this Court holds that integrati[o]n[] . . . would present a\n       significant risk of transmitting the deadly HIV virus.\n\nOp. at 62-63 (footnotes omitted) (religious programs).1\n\n       Instead of following this court’s mandate in Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495\n\n(11th Cir. 1991), requiring findings concerning “the risk of transmission . . . with\n\nregard to each program from which appellants have been automatically excluded,” id.\n\nat 1526, the district court simply deferred to the unsubstantiated suspicions of prison\n\n   1\n     This same passage was recited throughout the district court’s opinion. See Op. at 72-73\n(rehabilitation programs); 82-83 (visitation); 111-12 (vocational programs); 123 (recreational\nprograms); 132-33 (dining hall); 141-42 (medical clinic); 155-56 (out-of-prison programs); 165\n(educational programs); 178-79 (Laubach literacy program) 187 (sewing factory); 195-96 (data\nprocessing jobs); 203-04 (kitchen jobs); 211-12 (yard workers); 221-22 (laundry jobs); 230\n(trash recycling jobs); 238-39 (health care unit jobs); 246-47 (gate runner jobs); 254-55 (hair\ncutting jobs); 262-63 (use of library/library jobs); 277-78 (Double 0 Squad jobs); 285 (tractor\noperator jobs); 296-97 (maintenance jobs); 304 (trash detail jobs); 313-14 (runner jobs); 321-22\n(paralegal training class); 331-32 (educational programs); 344 (graduation ceremonies); 363-64\n(vocational programs); 378-79 (hair cutting jobs); 386-87 (laundry jobs); 394 (garden jobs); 402-\n03 (visitation); 410-11 (medical clinic visits); 420-21 (rehabilitation programs); 429-30\n(recreational programs); 439 (library); 446-47 (religious programs); 453 (Alabama Volunteers in\nCorrection program).\n\n                                               43\n\fofficials that transmission would occur.2 Even where there had been no history of\n\nhigh-risk activity in connection with a particular program, the district court attached\n\nno significance to the absence of such activity, noting that “the lack of incident reports\n\n. . . does not necessarily prove that high risk behavior does not occur,” Op. at 61, only\n\nthat such behavior “has not been discovered.” Op. at 62. In its analysis of these\n\nprograms and activities, the district court assumed that high-risk behavior would\n\neventually occur, explaining time and again that prison officials must expect the\n\nunexpected, thereby “allow[ing] the DOC to . . . guard against contingencies which,\n\nunder normal circumstances, would be considered only remote possibilities.” Op. at\n\n58. This rejection of evidence in favor of sheer speculation is reflected, for example,\n\nin the district court’s discussion of the out-of-prison programs.3                        Although\n\nacknowledging the evidence that “surveillance by a correctional officer would likely\n\nprevent [high-risk] behavior,” Op. at 152, in some of these programs, the district court\n\njustified its conclusion by constructing the following hypothetical:\n\n       [I]n the prison system, one must always be prepared for the unexpected.\n       An automobile or other accident may incapacitate a guard and leave the\n       inmates on the out-of-prison detail free to proceed without an escort. An\n\n\n   2\n     The majority, too, makes this error, affirming the district court based on evidence on high-\nrisk behavior in the prison system as a whole, not in each program as Harris required.\n   3\n    These programs permit inmates to leave prison, generally in handcuffs, under direct\nsurveillance of prison guards, to talk to school children about the perils of drug use, to attend a\nfuneral or seek medical care, or to work outside the institution fence.\n\n                                                 44\n\f      inmate, temporarily healthy but facing the bleak future of all sero-\n      positives, may have controlling impulses vastly different from those of\n      healthy inmates who may be more concerned about the penal aspects of\n      their future. . . .\n\n      If . . . a correctional officer has been incapacitated in an accident, a\n      female inmate with contempt for that officer could purposely implant,\n      while the guard remains unconscious, blood containing HIV organisms\n      from the HIV+ inmates open wounds. An unconscious guard would be\n      defenseless, and would perhaps never be fully aware of how the infection\n      was contracted. The unexpected must be expected in a penal setting or\n      when dealing with convicted felons.\n\nOp. at 153 (footnotes omitted).\n\n      As this passage illustrates, the district court’s analysis found that a mere\n\npossibility of a transmission risk, often based on nothing more than highly speculative\n\nscenarios, justifies the wholesale segregation and exclusion of HIV+ inmates from\n\nprison programs and activities. Under this reasoning, which the majority approves,\n\nan individual is, in essence, subject to segregation and discriminatory treatment simply\n\nfor having the HIV virus. This is precisely the result that\n\n§ 504 and Arline’s “significant risk” standard sought to prevent.\n\n      Nor are the cases cited by the majority to support its refusal to follow Bragdon\n\napplicable. These cases uphold the authority of hospitals to prohibit HIV+ physicians\n\nand surgical technicians from performing certain invasive surgical procedures based\n\non public health guidance authority absent here. See Mauro, 137 F.3d 398 (6th Cir.\n\n1998); Doe v. University of Maryland Medical Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261 (4th Cir.\n\n                                          45\n\f1995); Bradley v. University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Ctr., 3 F.3d 922 (5th\n\nCir. 1993). First, these cases were decided before Bragdon explained the distinction\n\nbetween a risk of HIV-transmission and a “significant risk.” Second, none of these\n\ncases hold that any risk of HIV transmission – no matter how small or remote – is a\n\nsignificant risk as a matter of law. In Mauro, Doe, and Bradley, the courts explicitly\n\nrelied on the guidance of public health officials to support their finding of a significant\n\nrisk and Bragdon teaches us that “the views of public health authorities,” such as the\n\nCenters for Disease Control (“CDC”), “are of special weight and authority.” Bragdon,\n\n118 S. Ct. at 2211. In Doe, for example, the court emphasized that the CDC had\n\nstated that “hospitals may bar HIV-positive surgeons from performing those\n\nprocedures identified by the hospital as exposure prone” and the university concluded\n\nthat “all neurosurgical procedures that would be performed by Dr. Doe fit the\n\ndefinition of exposure-prone procedures . . . .” Doe, 50 F.3d at 1266 (emphasis in\n\noriginal); see also Mauro, 137 F.3d at 404 (“defer[ring] to the medical judgment\n\nexpressed in the Report of the Centers for Disease Control”); Bradley, 3 F.3d at 924\n\n(relying on CDC guidelines). These cases, therefore, conclude, based on explicit CDC\n\nguidance, that a small risk of transmission in that particular context amounts to a\n\n“significant risk.” The record below does not contain any such guidelines or similar\n\nevidence. Moreover, the only testimony below in support of Alabama’s policy\n\n\n                                            46\n\fconsists of the opinions of corrections officials and none comes from any public\n\nhealth entity unconnected with the parties.\n\n      I likewise believe the majority errs in holding that plaintiffs were not “otherwise\n\nqualified” within the meaning of § 504 because of the prison’s penological interests\n\nin excluding them from the many programs and activities at issue here. In Harris, our\n\nmandate made clear that the prison’s penological interests supporting the segregation\n\nof HIV+ prisoners were not automatically sufficient to render plaintiffs unqualified,\n\nthereby declining to insulate the Alabama prison authorities from liability under the\n\nRehabilitation Act. We explained that\n\n      it is not enough for the district court simply to rely on general findings\n      and prison policy reasons that support segregation. . . . We . . . do not\n      believe . . . that the prison’s choice of blanket segregation should alone\n      insulate the DOC from its affirmative obligation under the Act to pursue\n      and implement such alternative, reasonable accommodations as are\n      possible for HIV-positive prisoners with respect to various programs and\n      activities that are available to the prison populations at large.\n\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1527 (footnote omitted).\n\n      Under § 504, the “otherwise qualified” analysis focuses on the requirements of\n\nthe program at issue and whether reasonable accommodations would permit the\n\nplaintiff to participate, see Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 n.17, not whether the\n\ndiscriminatory exclusion is supported by legitimate goals, penological or otherwise.\n\nAs Harris makes clear, a § 504 plaintiff is not rendered unqualified to participate in\n\n\n                                          47\n\fa prison program simply because the prison asserts general penological interests in\n\nexcluding him or her from participation.\n\n      This is not to say that penological concerns have no place in a § 504 analysis.\n\nAs the Seventh Circuit has explained, “[t]erms like ‘reasonable’ and ‘undue’ are\n\nrelative to circumstances, and the circumstances of a prison are different from those\n\nof a school, an office, or a factory,” and “[t]he security concerns that the defendant\n\nrightly emphasizes . . . are highly relevant to determining the feasibility of the\n\naccommodations that disabled prisoners need in order to have access to desired\n\nprograms and services.” Crawford v. Indiana Dep’t of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481, 487\n\n(7th Cir. 1997). As Crawford suggests, however, a prison’s legitimate penological\n\ninterests must be considered within the established § 504 framework – not by\n\nsupplanting this framework with the inapplicable constitutional analysis set forth in\n\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), as the district court did here. Cf. Dothard v.\n\nRawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 334-37 (1977) (considering prison’s penological interests\n\nwith established Title VII framework, not constitutional framework).\n\n      Finally, I disagree with the majority’s holding that the district court correctly\n\nconcluded that plaintiffs had failed to offer any reasonable accommodations, for\n\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\fseveral reasons.4 First, the majority errs in affirming the district court’s conclusion\n\nthat hiring any additional officers to reduce the risk of HIV-transmission would\n\nimpose an undue burden on the Alabama prison authorities to provide reasonable\n\naccommodation. Distancing itself from the district court’s statement that hiring even\n\na single officer would impose an undue burden, the majority unfairly characterizes the\n\nrelief requested by the plaintiffs as integration of all the programs and activities\n\nchallenged here, which it asserts would require hiring many additional officers. As\n\nthe majority must concede, the inability to accommodate plaintiffs in all the programs\n\nand activities would not justify Alabama’s refusal to provide accommodation in any\n\nof the programs and activities at issue here. The majority nonetheless affirms the\n\ndistrict court because plaintiffs did not specify which programs and activities they\n\nwould prefer to integrate. This begs the question since the district court failed to\n\nconduct the correct inquiry into each program as to whether integration would pose\n\na significant risk and what measures would be required to accommodate plaintiffs.\n\nThus, this question should also be remanded for a proper evidentiary hearing.\n\n\n\n   4\n    I would note that both the Supreme Court and this Court have repeatedly recognized that §\n504 requires covered recipients to make reasonable accommodations to permit individuals with\ndisabilities to participate in programs offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance. See\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985); Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525-27; Martinez, 861\nF.2d at 1505-07. Thus, I find no basis for the majority’s suggestion that the § 504 imposes no\nreasonable accommodation mandate and that the source of any duty to provide reasonable\naccommodations comes solely from the applicable agency regulations.\n\n                                                 49\n\f      Second, by rejecting the use of the prison risk classification system as a\n\nreasonable accommodation because it is not error free, the majority once again\n\nrequires a plaintiff to prove that he or she can not possibly transmit the HIV virus,\n\nthereby equating any possible transmission risk with the significant risk required to\n\nsupport exclusion under Arline and Bragdon. It may well be that the prison risk\n\nclassification system will not suffice to reduce the risk of transmission resulting from\n\nintegration to a less than significant one. At this point, however, the record is\n\ninadequate to establish the rate of error in the classification program in accordance\n\nwith Arline’s dictates. The district court excluded much, though not all, of the\n\nevidence about this classification scheme and the district court only found that this\n\nsystem was not error free. It made no findings regarding the likelihood of error.\n\nAccordingly, I believe that the district court’s exclusion of evidence on this point\n\nrequires a new trial.\n\n      I would note that it is significant that Alabama prison authorities use this\n\nselection process despite the possibility of error in the risk classification system and\n\ndespite the tragic, and even fatal, consequences of error, which have in fact occurred.\n\nThe majority offers no explanation why the prison system should be entitled to insist\n\nits risk classification system work in an error-free manner in the HIV context, and this\n\ncontext alone. Further, it appears that Alabama does not impose a similar policy of\n\n\n                                          50\n\fsegregation and exclusion where other inmates have other contagious diseases, such\n\nas hepatitis.\n\n       Congress and the Supreme Court have recognized that automatic expulsion and\n\nexclusion from society because of          “health risks” have historically masked\n\ndiscrimination against individuals with contagious diseases based on prejudice and\n\nbaseless fear. Certainly, care must be taken to minimize risk of infection, but care\n\nmust just as certainly be taken to assure that a society that aspires to be just does not\n\nmake outcasts of its stricken citizens. In this case, no fair assessment of the risks\n\ninvolved was conducted and no fair consideration was given to reasonable\n\naccommodations which could have minimized to an acceptable level those risks which\n\ndid exist. No balancing of rights occurred here. Thus, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\fHULL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       I respectfully dissent. The district court’s decision should be vacated and the\n\ncase retried because the district court refused to consider applying Alabama’s inmate\n\nrisk classification system as a reasonable accommodation, denied plaintiffs a fair trial,\n\nand failed to follow this Court’s mandate in the prior appeal of this case, Harris\n\nv.Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n       I agree with the majority that requiring more prison guards to prevent high-risk\n\nbehavior by inmates is an “undue burden” and that federal courts should not run\n\nAlabama’s prisons, much less micro-manage the state’s prison budget. However, the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing to consider plaintiffs’ alternative “reasonable\n\naccommodation” of utilizing the Alabama DOC’s ongoing inmate risk classification\n\nsystem, which already analyzes each inmate’s psychological, penological, and\n\nbehavioral history.1        Plaintiffs sought to show the DOC could reasonably\n\naccommodate at least some HIV-positive inmates in at least some religious,\n\neducational, vocational, and recreational prison programs by using its existent inmate\n\n\n\n\n   1\n    The Supreme Court and this Court have indicated that § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nrequires covered recipients of federal funds to make “reasonable accommodations” to permit\nindividuals with disabilities, such as HIV, to participate in programs offered by such recipients.\nSee Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 299-302 (1985); Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525-27; Martinez\nv. School Bd. of Hillsborough County, Fla., 861 F.2d 1502, 1505-07 (11th Cir. 1988). Thus,\nAlabama has to comply with the Rehabilitation Act because it accepts federal funds.\n\n                                                52\n\frisk classification system to do individualized assessments of transmission risks – as\n\nopposed to the current blanket segregation from most prison programs.2\n\nA.       Majority Acknowledges District Court’s Errors\n\n         The majority acknowledges the district court’s errors in not following the Harris\n\npanel’s mandate and in not allowing plaintiffs to introduce evidence regarding inmate\n\nrisk classification as a reasonable accommodation. The majority states:\n\n         (1) that “[t]he Harris panel directed the district court to consider reasonable\n\naccommodations, see Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527,” and that “[t]he Harris panel directed\n\nthe district court on remand to consider whether reasonable accommodations would\n\npermit the plaintiffs to participate in any of the programs at issue. See Harris, 941\n\nF.2d at 1527.”3\n\n\n\n\n     2\n   In holding that Title II of the ADA applies to state prisons, the Supreme Court noted that\n“[m]odern prisons provide inmates with many recreational ‘activities,’ medical ‘services,’ and\neducational and vocational ‘programs,’ all of which at least theoretically ‘benefit’ the prisoners.”\nPennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections v. Yeskey, ___ U.S. ___, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 1955 (1998).\n     3\n    Indeed, the Harris panel expressly stated that the district court on remand should “examine as\nto each [prison] program whether ‘reasonable accommodations’ by the DOC could minimize\nsuch [HIV] risk to an acceptable level.” Id. at 1527. The Harris panel expressly directed that\n“whether the risk of [HIV] transmission is sufficient to warrant categorical exclusion, and if so,\nwhether that risk can be rendered minimal through accommodation, are findings the district court\nmust make on remand.” Id. at 1527 n.47. The Harris panel remanded for “full findings of fact\nand conclusions of law as to each program and activity from which HIV-positive prisoners are\nbeing excluded, and a proper weighing of the dangers of transmission in each context.” Id. at\n1527.\n\n                                                53\n\f      (2) “that the Harris panel sensibly concluded that differences among the\n\nprograms in which the plaintiffs seek to participate required different analyses. See\n\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1527.”\n\n      (3) that “one reasonable accommodation that the plaintiffs proposed was for the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to refine existing systems of inmate classification to detect\n\nHIV-positive inmates who were highly unlikely to engage in high-risk behavior and\n\nto permit those inmates to participate in integrated programming. At trial, however,\n\neach time the defendants objected to classification evidence, the district court\n\nexcluded it on the reasoning that any evidence tending to be about individual inmates\n\n– even if the evidence concerned inmate classification systems in general – was\n\noutside the scope of the retrial mandated by this court”; and,\n\n      (4) that “[t]he district court should not, therefore, have excluded the plaintiffs’\n\nevidence about classification, and it should have considered classification as a\n\nreasonable accommodation.” So far, so good. The majority then wrongly concludes\n\nthat these errors do not require reversal.\n\nB.    Majority Wrongly Concludes Errors Do Not Require Reversal\n\n      The majority finds these new errors do not require reversal because some\n\nevidence about classification leaked in through the exclusion and the district court’s\n\nfinding that prisoners are “unpredictable” was “implicitly” a consideration and\n\n\n                                             54\n\frejection of inmate risk classification as a reasonable accommodation. I disagree for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n       First, the record shows unequivocally that at trial the district court refused to\n\nconsider inmate classification as a reasonable accommodation for any program and\n\nrefused to admit plaintiffs’ substantial evidence about inmate classification. For\n\nexample, in one instance, the court explained, “I did not let [plaintiffs’ expert witness]\n\ngo into the fact that there were some inmates that perhaps could be cleared for certain\n\nof these programs and others cannot. Because this is a class action not composed of\n\na division between those type people.” R.26 at 15. For other similar comments, see\n\nR.24 at 290 (“Well, you now want to say that you want to introduce evidence that\n\nthere are some people in the class of HIVs who are excluded that ought not to be\n\nexcluded. And . . . that is not an issue in this case and I mustn’t get into it.”); id. at\n\n291 (“. . . I am going to make you stick to the whole class unless the other side says\n\nthey are ready to defend on less than the whole class.”); id. at 299 (“[W]e don’t get\n\nto look at it from the viewpoint of singling out some HIV, who is the best of all the\n\nrest, like some people have done in cases.”); id. at 300 (“I am not going to let you\n\noffer all this business about what people you can break down and what people you\n\ncan’t. It is a class and it is a class action, and that is the way it is going to be tried.”);\n\nR.26. at 18 (“. . . I followed, or think I followed, the order of the court of appeals that\n\n\n                                             55\n\fI consider these matters particularized as to programs and activities but not as to\n\npersons. And you have tried to make it a proceeding wherein you particularize . . .\n\nor I would have to particularized [sic] my findings between persons; individual\n\npersons.”); id. at 19 (“[Y]ou might as well quit. You are keeping your expert here\n\nunnecessarily to go through a great number of words that really lead back to the\n\nquestion of whether I am supposed to have a hearing considering the rights of a class\n\nor of individual members of the class. And I understand that I am here to consider the\n\nrights of the class; not individual members of it. And I have so restrained you where\n\nI could.”); id. (“[Y]ou are trying to get me to break the class down into individualized\n\nclaims, which I can’t do.”).\n\n        Second, the majority incorrectly contends that substantial evidence about the\n\ninmate classification process leaked in through the exclusion. The majority lists this\n\n“substantial evidence” in footnote 19. A review of all record cites in footnote 19\n\nreveals that the evidence that leaked in consisted of only one manual and less than\n\nthirty pages of testimony in a thirteen-volume, 3654-page trial transcript. Moreover,\n\nthe district court expressly refused to consider such evidence that leaked in and even\n\nstruck some of it from the record.4\n\n   4\n    In at least one instance, the district court clarified that it would not consider the classification\nevidence that had leaked in, and the court directed that the testimony be struck from the record.\nR.34 at 214. Plaintiffs’ attorney then inquired, “Am I understanding correctly that . . . any\ninformation about determining which inmates are likely to engage in high risk behavior, meaning\n\n                                                  56\n\f       Moreover, the district court refused to admit the substantial evidence plaintiffs\n\ndid proffer. Here is but one example of plaintiffs’ proffers:\n\n              Plaintiffs, also offer to prove that classification is a traditional tool\n       of prison management by which the Alabama DOC, like all other DOCs,\n       makes distinctions among inmates, and that the classification process is\n       done [on] an individual basis, inmate by inmate.\n              We would offer to prove that in making those classification\n       decisions the DOC looks at the inmate’s criminal history institutional\n       disciplinary history, psychological tests administered by the staff\n       psychologist and similar factors; a team of people come together for each\n       inmate to make the classification assessment, a person from\n       Classification, a psychologist, a warden or assistant warden. And that\n       classification process includes precisely an assessment of whether the\n       inmate poses a significant risk of harming other inmates or other staff on\n       an inmate-by-inmate or individual basis.\n              And we would prove that, in fact, the Alabama classification\n       process expressly addresses the factor of whether an inmate as [sic]\n       aggressive homosexual. That is, the DOC’s classification process\n       already addresses some of the behavior related to transmission of HIV\n       and it would be a reasonable accommodation to have . . . to use that\n       classification system to qualify inmates with HIV for programs and\n       activities.\n              We would offer to prove that using the information that the\n       classification team is in a position to gather in the course of it[s] duties,\n       the classification process result in the assignments of a custody level to\n       an inmate ranging from community custody to minimum-in, to\n       minimum-out, to trustee, to medium, to close, to maximum. And,\n       moreover, that the classification team makes recommendations about\n       programs that the inmate should participate in, including rehabilitation\n       programs, education, trade school and community jobs. The DOC\n       institutional job board then actually looks at the classification materials\n       and makes an assessment on and an assignment. And this assignment is\n\nculling the good from the bad, will not be allowed?”, to which the court responded, “That is\ncorrect. That is a fairly good analysis of it. . . . Now I will let you ask and I will try to rule\nagainst you if you ask the wrong questions. I won’t tell you you can’t ask.” R.34 at 216.\n\n                                                  57\n\f       on an individualized basis of inmates to trade school, community job and\n       other job assignments.\n              Our proof would be that the DOC institutional job board already\n       selects among general population inmates and decides that some of them\n       and not others will participate in particular programs.\n              The plaintiff’s proof would address these facts. Plaintiff’s\n       position is that the same selection and screening process that is already\n       applied to general population inmates through the institutional job board\n       could be utilized, possibly with enhanced factors, to determine who may\n       participate in particular jobs and other programs.\n              Plaintiffs would offer to prove that other jurisdictions have\n       devised classification systems for HIV positive inmates by which the\n       issue of whether an inmate poses a significant risk of transmission is\n       determined on an individualized basis inmate-by-inmate as part of its\n       classification system, and that this would be a reasonable thing for\n       Alabama to do.\n              We would show that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has a system\n       by which inmates who engage in high risk activity are segregated and\n       remain segregated until an assessment is made that an inmate has\n       rehabilitated himself such that he no longer poses a risk of transmission.\n\nR.26 at 15-18. The district court repeatedly refused to allow plaintiffs to present such\n\nproof.5\n\n       Even if a paucity of evidence about classification, as I find, or “substantial\n\nevidence,” as the majority finds, leaked in through the exclusion, the district court’s\n\nerrors still require reversal because the district court refused to consider such evidence\n\nand never made any findings of fact or legal analysis about inmate classification as a\n\n“reasonable accommodation.” The majority finds that the district court “implicitly”\n\n\n   5\n   See, e.g., R.24 at 289-91; id. at 299-300; R.26 at 15-20; R.34 at 214-15; R.35 at 214; id. at\n215; id. at 220; id. at 222; id. at 227; id. at 228; id. at 230; id. at 231.\n\n                                                58\n\fdid so because the district court found inmates are “unpredictable.” The majority’s\n\nanalysis on this point is as follows:\n\n      The [district] court found that inmates are “untrustworth[y],”\n      “volatil[e],” “unpredictable,” and subject to “great pressures from\n      conflicting sources.” . . . Therefore, the court found, prison officials must\n      always “prepare[] for the worst” and “expect the unexpected.” (Id. at 57,\n      58.) These findings are an implicit rejection of plaintiffs’ arguments. If\n      prisoners are inherently “unpredictable,” as the district court found, then\n      classification is not a reasonable way of integrating programs, because\n      it does not reduce the risk of HIV transmission.\n\nI respectfully submit that the district court’s finding that prisoners are “unpredictable”\n\nis not an “implicit rejection” of plaintiffs’ classification arguments and does not show\n\nthat “the district court implicitly considered the feasibility of classification.”\n\nPrisoners’ being “unpredictable” is no factual finding – much less a legal analysis –\n\nabout whether inmate classification is a reasonable accommodation for at least some\n\nHIV-positive inmates for at least certain prison programs.\n\n      Finally, this is no first appeal where “implicit” district court findings might be\n\njustifiably found by an appellate court from an ambiguous record. This is the second\n\nappeal after the Harris panel’s decision reversed, expressly directed the district court\n\nto consider reasonable accommodations, and remanded “for additional findings and\n\nclarification by the district court.” Id. at 1528. Rather than requiring the district court\n\nto make the legal analysis or factual findings required by the Harris mandate, the\n\nmajority wrongly excuses the district court’s errors by finding that the district court\n\n                                            59\n\fsomehow “implicitly” did what it plainly did not do and expressly in the record\n\nrefused to do.\n\nC.     Errors Affected a Core Issue and Denied Plaintiffs a Fair Trial\n\n       There is justifiable reluctance to reverse and remand once again for a new trial\n\nin this protracted case. But a retrial is required because the district court’s clear errors\n\naffected a core issue in the case and substantially prejudiced the plaintiffs’ trial. By\n\nnegating one of plaintiffs’ principal claims – namely, that applying the DOC’s inmate\n\nrisk classification system would allow at least some HIV-positive prisoners to be\n\naccommodated reasonably in certain prison programs – the district court drew into\n\nquestion its judgment with respect to each prison program for which plaintiffs\n\nsuggested individualized risk assessment as a reasonable accommodation.\n\n       Although appellate courts should refrain from second-guessing prison officials\n\nand district courts in their difficult jobs, appellate courts should assure the\n\nfundamental right to a fair trial. The Harris panel aptly concluded that “it may turn\n\nout that the court’s conclusion of the significance of the risk of HIV transmission with\n\nregard to each program will be unaltered.” Harris at 1526. I likewise do not predict\n\nthe result of a fair trial – but know only that plaintiffs were denied one.\n\n       In conclusion, the district court did not follow the Harris panel’s mandate, erred\n\nin precluding much of plaintiffs’ evidence regarding inmate risk classification, erred\n\n\n                                            60\n\fin refusing to consider the evidence that leaked in regarding inmate risk classification,\n\nand erred in refusing to consider inmate risk classification as a reasonable\n\naccommodation. Respectfully, I would vacate the district court’s decision and remand\n\nthis case for a new trial.6 Because I find that remand for a new trial is required, I do\n\nnot reach the other issues presented by this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n    It is noteworthy that the Harris panel aptly observed, “Intuitively, however, it seems as if\nthere are several programs or activities in which the risk of transmission would be rather\nminimal. An example is the participation of seropositive prisoners in college classes.” Harris,\n941 F.2d at 1527 n.47. Intuitively, it does seem as if there are at least a few programs, such as\nreligious services and college classes, where the transmission by non-violent seropositive\noffenders with no history of high-risk behavior or aggressive behavioral problems would be so\nremote or non-existent as to allow integration as opposed to blanket segregation. This is\nespecially true given that the profile of a state’s inmates is usually as diverse as that of a state’s\npopulation: male and female, of all races and creeds, college educated and illiterate, with or\nwithout high school diplomas, rich and poor, and guilty of crimes ranging from mass murders to\nnon-violent credit card fraud. Likewise, the causes of inmates’ HIV-positive status are equally\nvaried and range from transmissions from mother to fetus during pregnancy or childbirth,\ntransfusions during operations, and consensual marital sexual relations to intravenous drug use,\nneedle-sharing, and other high-risk behavior. Some prisoners have a history of no high-risk\nbehavior while other inmates have just the opposite history. This further exemplifies why the\ndistrict court’s errors in excluding plaintiffs’ evidence denied plaintiffs a fair trial.\n\n                                                  61\n\f",

The district court denied relief, and we affirm.\n\n                                          I. Background\n\n       This litigation began over a decade ago in reaction to a legislatively inspired program to\n\nprevent the spread of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Alabama’s prison system.\n\nUnder statute,2 the Alabama prison system tests all entering inmates for infection with HIV, which\n\ncauses AIDS.

The Department of\n\nCorrections segregates inmates testing positive for the virus from the general inmate population in\n\nHIV-positive units, one for men at the Limestone Correctional Facility and one for women at the\n\nJulia Tutwiler Prison for Women. Id. at 1500.\n\n       So segregated, the HIV-positive inmates are unable to participate in many programs and\n\nactivities with the HIV-negative, general population. Programs that are available only to the general\n\npopulation program at Limestone include “Double O” squad jobs maintaining the prison grounds,\n\njobs on the prison farm, bus squad jobs, facility maintenance jobs, trash detail jobs, kitchen jobs,\n\nrunner jobs, upholstery classes, electrical technology classes, auto mechanics classes, construction\n\n\n\n   1\n       29 U.S.C. § 794.\n   2\n       Ala. Code § 22-11A-17(a) (1996 Supp.)\n\n                                                 2\n\ftrade classes, automotive body repair classes, horticulture classes, welding classes,3 staff barber jobs,\n\ninmate barber jobs, laundry jobs, gardening jobs in the prison’s vegetable gardens, the “Free by\n\nChoice” program (in which prisoners go to schools to talk to pupils about substance abuse and\n\ncriminality), basketball and baseball tournaments, and “Alabama Volunteers in Corrections”\n\nmeetings (to prepare prisoners for release). Programs that are available separately to Limestone\n\nHIV-positive inmates include paralegal training classes (HIV-positive inmates see videotapes of live\n\ninstruction); adult basic education, GED testing, Narcotics and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,\n\ngraduation ceremonies, drafting classes, haircuts, visitation, medical treatment, gymnasium and\n\nlibrary time, chapel services, dining, and prisoner transportation.\n\n        A similar range of programs is unavailable to HIV-positive inmates at Tutwiler: data\n\nprocessing classes, clerical classes, cosmetology classes, sewing classes, building trades classes,\n\nautomotive repair classes, welding classes, floral design classes, small business machine repair\n\nclasses, quantity foods service classes, nutrition classes, concerts and talent shows, softball and\n\nvolleyball games, the “Free by Choice” program, college classes, Laubach literacy training, sewing\n\nfactory jobs, data processing jobs, “downtown” jobs for government agencies, community projects\n\njobs, road squad jobs, kitchen jobs, yard jobs, maintenance jobs, housekeeping jobs, laundry jobs,\n\ntrash jobs, runner jobs, and haircutting jobs. Like their male counterparts, however, the HIV-\n\npositive prisoners at Tutwiler also have access to many programs separately from the general\n\npopulation: chapel services, some rehabilitation programs such as substance abuse and stress\n\n\n\n   3\n        Correspondence in the months before the 1994 trial between the commissioner of\ncorrections and the commissioner of post-secondary education suggest an intent to offer\nvocational and college classes to HIV-positive inmates separately from the general prison\npopulation. This intent, however, had not been fully realized at the time of trial.\n\n                                                   3\n\fmanagement counseling, visitation, organized recreational activities such as May Day and\n\nOktoberfest, dining, medical care, adult basic education, GED testing, library use, and prisoner\n\ntransportation.\n\n       The plaintiff class challenged this practice of denying some programs to the HIV-positive,\n\nand providing other programs separately, as a violation of several constitutional rights and of § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.4 The district court denied relief after a bench trial. The court\n\nconcluded that no constitutional rights were violated. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1521. It further\n\nconcluded that the plaintiffs were not “otherwise qualified,” as required for rights to arise under §\n\n504, to participate in integrated programs because their participation would pose a significant HIV-\n\ntransmission risk. This court affirmed judgment against the plaintiffs on the constitutional claims.\n\nThis court held, however, that § 504 requires a program-by-program analysis to determine if the\n\nplaintiffs merit relief. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1523. The action was remanded to the district\n\ncourt for this fact-finding. This court directed the district court especially to evaluate\n\nthe risk of HIV transmission in each program in order to determine whether the\n\nplaintiffs were otherwise qualified to participate in each program. In so directing the\n\ndistrict court, the panel nonetheless acknowledged that “the court’s conclusion of the\n\nsignificance of the risk of HIV transmission with regard to each program [could] be\n\nunaltered.” Id. at 1526.\n\n\n\n\n   4\n       Codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1994).\n\n                                                 4\n\f      Measuring the significance of the risk of HIV transmission in a host of\n\nprograms (and thus determining whether the plaintiffs were otherwise qualified to\n\nparticipate) was accordingly the focus of the second trial. One relevant fact was\n\nundisputed: In the state of medical knowledge and art at the time of trial, HIV\n\ninfection inevitably progressed to AIDS. AIDS always led to death, often after\n\nlengthy suffering. But the parties’ evidence and arguments reflected two different\n\napproaches to the problem of measuring risk. Both sides presented substantial\n\nevidence in support of their positions.\n\n      On one hand, the plaintiffs argued that experience teaches us that the odds of\n\nHIV transmission in prison programs are remote at best. Their evidence fell into two\n\ncategories. First, the plaintiffs presented expert testimony that incidents of HIV\n\ntransmission in many activities are rare or virtually unknown. For instance, at the\n\ntime of trial there were no reported cases of transmission as a result of lesbian sex.\n\nThere was a similar lack of reported incidents of transmission from sports injuries,\n\nstabbing, or tattooing. Only “sporadic” instances of transmission from oral sex and\n\nfistfights had been reported. In short, the possibility of transmission in certain unusual\n\ncircumstances (for instance in a fight if both participants bleed copiously into each\n\nother’s wounds, or during barbering if bloody razors are immediately reused) had not\n\nbeen realized in any commonly recurring way.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      Second, however, the plaintiffs’ medical expert had to acknowledge that anal\n\nsex and needle-sharing are high-risk activities. Rather than assert the medical\n\nunlikelihood of transmission from these activities, the plaintiffs presented evidence\n\nof the rarity of such conduct in the programs in which they wish to participate. The\n\nplaintiffs’ prison security expert combed prison files for incident reports and found\n\nnone describing anal sex or needle-sharing during a wide variety of prison programs\n\nat both Limestone and Tutwiler. Reported incidents being rare or unknown in the\n\npast, the plaintiffs reason, we can expect them to be rare or unknown in the future\n\neven if HIV-positive inmates participate in integrated programs. The plaintiffs also\n\nshowed that many of these programs are in high demand, and that inmates therefore\n\nhave every incentive to be on their best behavior; moreover, they point out, the degree\n\nof surveillance in most programs makes an occurrence of anal sex, for instance,\n\nimplausible.\n\n      While not completely contradicting any of this testimony, the defendants\n\nstressed other facts. They introduced testimony that HIV transmission is theoretically\n\npossible, even if not documented, in sports accidents and during fights — wherever\n\nthere is a large exchange of blood between an infected person and an uninfected one.\n\nAnd the defendants introduced evidence that concededly high-risk activity abounds\n\nin prison. This evidence included a six-inch high stack of incident reports from the\n\n\n                                          6\n\fpast few years describing hidden hypodermic needles, homosexual acts, and bloody\n\nfights. The defendants also showed that a 1991 outbreak of syphilis in the HIV-\n\npositive population at Limestone, in which 86 inmates were ultimately treated, was\n\ntraceable to a single inmate. Finally, the defendants offered studies showing that\n\nresidentially integrated prison systems in Maryland, Nevada, and Illinois have\n\nexperienced seroconversions at annual rates of .41% , .19%, and .33%, respectively.5\n\nIn Alabama, by contrast, over the entire roughly eight-year period of entrance and\n\nexit HIV- testing before the time of trial, (see R.31 at 167), only two inmates out of\n\nthe at least 30,000 tested had seroconverted — an all-time rate of .0067%. (See id. at\n\n106 (at least 30,000 inmates tested); id. at 166 (two total seroconverted).) Had the\n\nAlabama seroconversion rates resembled those in Illinois, in the neighborhood of 5\n\ninmates per year would have contracted HIV at Limestone alone, perhaps 40 over an\n\neight-year period.6\n\n       Neither side’s evidence was iron-clad on the points they emphasized. The\n\nplaintiffs undermined the defendants’ evidence of widespread high-risk behavior with\n\nanecdotal evidence of risk-free mixing. The defendants, on the other hand, called into\n\nquestion the plaintiffs’ reliance on the absence of incident reports by offering\n\n  5\n       A “seroconversion” has occurred when an inmate who tested negative for HIV upon\nentering prison later tests positive.\n  6\n       At the time of trial, one of plaintiffs’ experts put Limestone’s population at about 1600.\n\n                                                7\n\ftestimony that much high-risk activity goes unreported, even when discovered, and\n\nthat inmates have developed techniques such as “hot railing” — posting a lookout —\n\nto avoid detection by roving guards. The defendants showed that a runner, who as\n\nsuch held a highly coveted job, forfeited it by engaging in a high-risk act in the HIV-\n\npositive unit. They also offered evidence of a single, sensational incident of high-risk\n\nbehavior committed by two Limestone kitchen workers who engaged in homosexual\n\nsex in the kitchen bakery beside a mixing bowl of peanut butter and jelly.\n\n       The district court generally took the defendants’ view of the facts. The court\n\nmade two significant findings of fact, neither of which the plaintiffs have challenged\n\nas clearly erroneous. The first finding is that sex, intravenous drug use, and bloodshed\n\nare a perpetual possibility in prison whenever a security guard trained to stop it is not\n\nwatching, and that prison life is inherently unpredictable—especially when large-scale\n\nmixing of HIV-positive and HIV-negative prisoners in Alabama is untried. The\n\nsecond finding is that HIV is transmitted by sex, intravenous drug use, and blood-to-\n\nblood contact. If these activities can spread HIV, and these activities can occur\n\nbetween HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates, the court reasoned, then HIV\n\ntransmission is more than a theoretical possibility, even if we have no examples.\n\n      From these facts, the court concluded that the transmission risk is significant\n\nin all programs. After all, each case of transmission, however rare, claims at least one\n\n\n                                           8\n\flife. More lives could follow if the infected general-population inmate spreads the\n\nvirus to his cellmates, who in turn spread it farther, as was the case with the 1991\n\nsyphilis outbreak at Limestone. Given this degree of harm, even slim odds of\n\ntransmission make the risk significant. As the court put it in words echoed throughout\n\nits 476-page opinion, “elimination of high risk behavior is impossible. . . . Because the\n\nDefendant/Prison system has decided that such conduct is likely, and because of the\n\ncatastrophic severity of the consequences if such conduct does occur, this Court holds\n\nthat integrating the [program under discussion] would present a significant risk of\n\ntransmitting the deadly HIV virus. Accordingly, the HIV+ inmates are not ‘otherwise\n\nqualified.’” (R.6-532 at 313-314 (emphasis added); accord, e.g., id. at 82, 277-78.)\n\n      The court took this otherwise-qualified analysis one step further. As part of its\n\nevaluation of the plaintiffs’ qualifications to participate in the programs, it weighed\n\nthe Department of Corrections’ penological concerns, including the danger of violence\n\nthat might arise from inmate prejudice toward and fear of HIV-positive prisoners. The\n\ncourt looked to Turner v. Safley, which permits infringement of prisoners’ First\n\nAmendment rights provided that the prison regulation “is reasonably related to\n\nlegitimate penological interests,”7 as a guide to evaluating the Department of\n\nCorrections’ interests. In almost every program, the court concluded that the\n\n\n  7\n      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In one program, interstate prisoner exchange,8 the\n\ncourt found that penological concerns alone — the cost of medical care for the HIV-\n\npositive — sufficed to excuse the exclusion of HIV-positive inmates.\n\n        The district court continued its analysis, as directed by this court,9 by asking if\n\nreasonable accommodations would make the plaintiffs otherwise qualified. Although\n\nthe court found that in many programs the plaintiffs had already been reasonably\n\naccommodated by provision of identical, but segregated programs,10 the court found\n\nas to other programs that the only reasonable accommodation would be additional\n\nguards to prevent high-risk behavior. The court concluded, however, that hiring the\n\ndozens of guards necessary to integrate all the programs safely would place an undue\n\nfinancial burden on the Department of Corrections.\n\n\n\n\n   8\n        In this program, based on an interstate compact, inmates may serve their terms in another\nstate (for personal reasons, for instance) if that state agrees to send one of its inmates to\nAlabama.\n   9\n        Harris v.

Discussion\n\n        A.     What is a “significant risk”?\n\n        While not challenging the district court’s findings of fact, the plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the district court misapplied the law and this court’s mandate in determining\n\nwhether they qualify for relief under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In particular,\n\nthey contend that the court wrongly interpreted a “significant risk” of HIV\n\ntransmission to mean “any risk.” We conclude that the district court’s conclusion,\n\nbased on its unchallenged findings of fact, is substantially correct.\n\n        Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, under which the plaintiffs seek relief,12\n\nprohibits discrimination against “otherwise qualified individual[s] with a disability.”\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). An “individual with a disability” does not include “an individual\n\n\n\nof programs. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. We note further that it was the plaintiffs, not the\ndefendants, who objected to introduction of this evidence at trial. (See R.36 at 92 (“Work\nrelease is no longer a part of this case.”).)\n   12\n         As we address more thoroughly in the reasonable-accommodation discussion below,\nthere are potentially applicable agency regulations promulgated under § 504. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R.\nsubpt. G (Department of Justice regulations). Each agency’s regulations, however, generally\napply only to recipients of funds from that agency. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 45.202 (restricting\napplication of Department of Justice regulations to recipients of financial assistance from the\nDepartment of Justice). We cannot tell from the record where the Department of Corrections\ngets its federal funds and thus what regulations apply. We assume for this discussion that any\napplicable regulations would not contradict our analysis of the statute.\n\n                                               12\n\fwho has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such\n\ndisease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other\n\nindividuals.” 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(D).

The Court further directed the courts to “defer to the\n\nreasonable medical judgments of public health officials.” Id.; see also Bragdon, 118\n\nS.

First,\n\nArline’s four factors include both “the severity of the risk” and “the probabilities the\n\ndisease will be transmitted,” not just the odds the virus will spread. This suggests that\n\neach must interplay with the other in the otherwise-qualified inquiry. Second,\n\nsignificance by itself connotes more than size: “significant” means “deserving to be\n\nconsidered,” “important,” “weighty,” or “notable.” Webster’s Third International\n\nDictionary 2116 (1986). It does not just mean “big.” See id. And it is the potential\n\ngravity of the harm that imbues certain odds of an event with significance. This is\n\nindeed common sense: to borrow an analogy from the district court’s opinion, we are\n\nfar more likely to consider walking a tightrope to pose a significant risk if the rope is\n\nfifty feet high than if it is one foot off the ground. This is so even if the odds of losing\n\nour balance are the same however far we have to fall.\n\n        Thus, when the adverse event is the contraction of a fatal disease, the risk of\n\ntransmission can be significant even if the probability of transmission is low: death\n\nitself makes the risk “significant.” But federal courts disagree about how low the odds\n\nmay be, and how much evidence it takes to prove a significant risk.14 On one hand,\n\n   14\n       The cases cited here concerned suits under both the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act. The Acts’ standards for carriers of contagious diseases are the same. See\nEstate of Mauro ex rel. Mauro v.

See Abbott v.\nBragdon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760111\"><a href=\"/opinion/760111/sidney-abbott-v-randon-bragdon-dmd/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                               17\n\farguably conflicting statutory policies. First, requiring evidence that the asserted risk\n\nof transmission has a sound theoretical basis prevents the Act from overlooking the\n\nunfounded fears and prejudices that Congress meant to uproot. See Arline, 480 U.S.\n\nat 285-87, 107 S. Ct. at 1129-31. Second, the more cautious rule protects federal\n\nfunds recipients from well-founded worries that deaths can result from a ruling that\n\nan HIV-positive plaintiff is otherwise qualified, and thus it avoids the absurd\n\nconclusion that Congress has decreed even a few painful deaths in service of the Act’s\n\nnoble goals.

Accepting proof of a theoretically possible method of transmission as\n\nsufficient recognizes — unlike the First Circuit’s approach — that saying a risk of an\n\nevent is small does not mean that it will not happen. And each time the event occurs,\n\nit is real people — not cold ciphers — that suffer the consequences. Saying that only\n\none in 42,000 persons will die if exposed to a risk, see Mauro, 137 F.3d at 407, does\n\nnot make that one’s death insignificant.\n\n      We thus hold that when transmitting a disease inevitably entails death, the\n\nevidence supports a finding of “significant risk” if it shows both (1) that a certain\n\n\n                                           18\n\fevent can occur and (2) that according to reliable medical opinion the event can\n\ntransmit the disease. This is not an “any risk” standard: the asserted danger of transfer\n\nmust be rooted in sound medical opinion and not be speculative or fanciful. But this\n\nis not a “somebody has to die first” standard, either: evidence of actual transmission\n\nof the fatal disease in the relevant context is not necessary to a finding of significant\n\nrisk.\n\n        Based on Arline’s standard thus interpreted, the district court’s conclusion was\n\ncorrect. Two of the district court’s unchallenged factual findings support its result.\n\nFirst, the district court found that violence, intravenous drug use, and sex may cause\n\nblood-to-blood contact and happen in prisons in the most unlikely and unexpected\n\nplaces and that it is impossible to know or watch much of what goes on. Second, the\n\ncourt found (based on adequate expert testimony) that blood-to-blood contact, such\n\nas that resulting from anal sex or needle-sharing, likely transmits HIV, and that violent\n\nexchanges of blood raise the specter of transmission. These two findings were enough\n\nfor the court, sitting as fact-finder, to conclude that the risk was significant in any\n\nprogram in which prisoners participate.16\n\n   16\n        The plaintiffs also complain that the district court ignored this court’s earlier mandate to\nassess each program individually. We reject this argument. It is true that the court reached the\nsame conclusion for a host of different programs; but nothing in the earlier mandate required the\ncourt to conclude that the programs were different.

Turner provides four factors to\n\nguide a court’s determination of whether a prison regulation is “reasonably related to\n\nlegitimate penological interests”; if the regulation is, then it escapes constitutional\n\nscrutiny. Id. at 89, 107 S. Ct. at 2261. Those four factors17 served as makeweights to\n\nthe district court’s conclusions here for all the programs, and for one program (the\n\ninterstate prisoner exchange program), the Turner analysis served as the sole basis for\n\ndenying relief.\n\n        We can agree with the plaintiffs’ primary argument that Turner does not, by its\n\nterms, apply to statutory rights. That does not mean, however, that the district court’s\n\nuse of the Turner factors requires vacating its judgment. Section 504’s provisions\n\nextend only to “otherwise qualified individual[s] with a disability.” 29 U.S.C. §\n\n794(a). “An otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of a program’s\n\n\npage opinion, moreover, doggedly reviews the independent evidence for each program.\n   17\n        The four factors are (1) the connection between the prison regulation and a legitimate,\nneutral government interest, (2) the presence or absence of alternatives for the prisoners to\nexercise their claimed right, (3) the effect of unfettered exercise of the right on other inmates,\nguards, and the allocation of prison resources, and (4) the presence or absence of ready\nalternatives.

Penological concerns such as security and cost are legitimate, and the\n\nevidence in this case shows that these are in fact the concerns behind the program\n\nrequirements that participating prisoners neither create a threat of disorder or\n\nunreasonable costs. Thus, even if the district court’s importation of Turner’s\n\nstandards into the Rehabilitation Act was not precisely correct as a matter of legal\n\ntheory, determining whether penological concerns impose requirements for program\n\nparticipation is not error. See Crawford v. Indiana Dep’t of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741785\"><a href=\"/opinion/741785/ricky-crawford-v-indiana-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\n      While not conceding that Turner-like factors are properly considered at all, the\n\nplaintiffs also argue that the district court misapplied Turner first by making a clearly\n\nerroneous finding that integrating programs would risk violence, and second by\n\nconcluding that the Department of Corrections’ segregation policy is not an\n\nexaggerated response to the problem of prison security and slowing the virus’s spread.\n\n      We reject both arguments. The district court’s finding as to the risk of HIV-\n\nrelated violence was, as the plaintiffs point out, based on conflicting evidence. The\n\ndefendants offered a study of inmate opinion that was both off-point (it asked for\n\nviews on residential integration, not program integration) and six years old at the time\n\nof trial. But the plaintiffs did not do much better; they offered only anecdotal\n\nevidence of peaceful intermingling between HIV-positive and HIV-negative inmates.\n\n\n                                           22\n\fIf two findings were possible here — risk of violence from intermingling or no risk\n\nof violence from intermingling — both required drawing a series of inferences from\n\nthe parties’ scant evidence. The district court chose to infer from the defendants’\n\nstudy (1) that residential and program integration would be equally objectionable to\n\ncertain inmates and (2) that inmate opinion had remained substantially unchanged\n\nover a six-year period. To make the finding plaintiffs urged, the district court would\n\nhave had to infer at least (1) that the HIV-negative inmates involved in peaceful\n\nintermingling represent the unanimous sentiment among HIV-negative inmates and\n\n(2) that special circumstances surrounding the intermingling did not contribute to the\n\npeacefulness. The district court’s choice of the former inferences over the latter ones\n\nis not clearly erroneous.\n\n      The court’s conclusion that the response is not exaggerated, moreover, properly\n\nfollows Turner’s guidance. (The plaintiffs do not contend that Turner’s “exaggerated\n\nresponse” analysis in particular is inappropriate for Rehabilitation Act otherwise-\n\nqualified analysis.) Turner compels a conclusion that a response is exaggerated only\n\nwhen the inmate produces evidence of “easy alternatives” that come at a de minimis\n\ncost to valid penological interests. Turner, 482 U.S. at 91, 107 S. Ct. at 2262. The\n\nplaintiffs’ proposed “easy alternative” is to exclude from programs the prisoners who\n\nmight react violently to integration. The record does not support the ease of this\n\n\n                                          23\n\falternative, which would apparently require the Department of Corrections to evaluate\n\nthe attitudes and predict the behavior of every program participant. The district court\n\ncould correctly conclude that segregated programs are not an exaggerated response\n\nto the problem of violence.\n\n      In sum, then, we conclude that the district court could properly use factors such\n\nas Turner’s to determine whether the plaintiffs were otherwise qualified to participate\n\nin the programs. The district court’s analysis of those factors, moreover, was\n\nsubstantially correct.\n\n      C.     Did the district        court     appropriately   evaluate   “reasonable\n             accommodations”?\n\n      The Harris panel directed the district court on remand to consider whether\n\nreasonable accommodations would permit the plaintiffs to participate in any of the\n\nprograms at issue. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. The district court did so and\n\nconcluded in most programs that the proposed accommodations, which mostly\n\nconsisted of hiring additional guards to prevent high-risk behavior, would impose an\n\nundue burden on the prison programs. The plaintiffs challenge the district court’s\n\nconclusions on four grounds.\n\n      Before we get to the specific challenges, however, we have to point out that we\n\nare not construing any law whose source we may clearly identify. This is because the\n\nreasonable-accommodation principle (that a disabled person is entitled to participate\n\n                                          24\n\fin a program, notwithstanding lack of qualification, if a reasonable accommodation\n\nwould qualify him) does not appear in § 504. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 706, 794. The\n\nprinciple appears, rather, in agency regulations promulgated under the statute’s\n\nauthority. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 42.511(a) (Department of Justice); 29 C.F.R. § 32.13\n\n(Department of Labor). The applicability of these regulations as a general rule\n\nfollows federal funding from an agency. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 42.502; 29 C.F.R. §\n\n32.2(a). Unfortunately, the district court denied the plaintiffs discovery of the source\n\nof the Department of Corrections’ federal funding, and the plaintiffs did not pursue\n\nquestioning on this subject at trial. Thus, with one exception,18 we do not know what\n\nregulations apply to the Department of Corrections. And this matters: Different\n\nagency regulations lay out the contours of the reasonable-accommodation principle\n\ndifferently.     For instance, Department of Justice regulations require no\n\naccommodation at all in nonemployment programs, see 28 C.F.R. § 42.540(l)(2),\n\nwhile Department of Labor regulations require reasonable accommodation in\n\nemployment training programs, see 29 C.F.R. § 32.13(a).\n\n\n\n\n   18\n        We know that the Department of Labor contributes funds to the Department of\nCorrections’ adult basic education programs. (See R.26 at 223.) Those programs, therefore, fall\nunder Labor regulations, but the regulations by their own terms do not extend beyond that\nprogram. See 29 C.F.R. § 32.2(a) (“This part applies to each recipient of Federal financial\nassistance from the Department of Labor . . . but is limited to the particular program for which\nFederal financial assistance is provided.”)\n\n                                               25\n\f      Our ignorance of what law controls has not, however, been troubling to any\n\nparty; the parties briefed the question only upon order of this court. Nor was it\n\ntroubling to the Harris panel. See Harris, 941 F.3d at 1547. Rather than disturb what\n\nhave become the parties’ settled expectations, therefore, we elect to apply some sort\n\nof least-common-denominator reasonable-accommodation principle, and we assume\n\nfor present purposes (notwithstanding some arguably contrary regulations) that the\n\nreasonable-accommodation principle applies to all the programs under discussion.

Choate, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300-04, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We thus look to some regulations for guidance, but our interpretation here\n\nwould not trump any agency regulation that interprets § 504 differently.\n\n      One further caveat: we acknowledge that the Harris panel sensibly concluded\n\nthat differences among the programs in which the plaintiffs seek to participate\n\nrequired different analyses. See Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527. In this court, however, the\n\nplaintiffs have painted their reasonable-accommodation arguments with a broad brush,\n\nand we follow their lead in explaining our rulings.\n\n\n                                         26\n\f               1.    Was classifying high- and low-risk prisoners an accommodation\n                     open to consideration?\n\n         One reasonable accommodation that the plaintiffs proposed was for the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to refine existing systems of inmate classification to detect\n\nHIV-positive inmates who were highly unlikely to engage in high-risk behavior and\n\nto permit those inmates to participate in integrated programming. At trial, however,\n\neach time the defendants objected to classification evidence, the court excluded it on\n\nthe reasoning that any evidence tending to be about individual inmates — even if the\n\nevidence concerned inmate classification systems in general — was outside the scope\n\nof the retrial mandated by this court. For the same reason, the court implied that it\n\nwould not consider the evidence or the argument. The plaintiffs contend that both the\n\nexclusion of evidence and the refusal to consider the evidence in the bench trial was\n\nerror.\n\n         We agree with the plaintiffs that consideration of this proposed accommodation\n\n(and, therefore, evidence of it) was within the mandate. The Harris panel directed the\n\ndistrict court to consider reasonable accommodations, see Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527,\n\nand this argument and evidence was about classifying all the class members for access\n\nto particular programs. The district court should not, therefore, have excluded the\n\nplaintiffs’ evidence about classification, and it should have considered classification\n\nas a reasonable accommodation.\n\n                                           27\n\f        But this conclusion does not mean that reversal is required. The defendants did\n\nnot always object to classification evidence, and throughout the trial the plaintiffs\n\nwere allowed to introduce substantial evidence about the classification process at the\n\nDepartment of Corrections (including the Department of Corrections’ inmate\n\nClassification Manual) and about classification’s potential effectiveness.19 Thus, the\n\ncourt’s evidentiary ruling did not prevent the plaintiffs from making a classification\n\nargument. Furthermore, while the court implied at trial that it would not consider\n\nclassification as an accommodation, the court’s findings of fact make clear that it did\n\nconsider classification, if only implicitly.           The court found that inmates are\n\n“untrustworth[y],” “volatil[e],” “unpredictable,” and subject to “great pressures from\n\nconflicting sources.” (R.6-531 at 56, 57.) Therefore, the court found, prison officials\n\nmust always “prepare[] for the worst” and “expect the unexpected.” (Id. at 57, 58.)\n\nThese findings are an implicit rejection of plaintiffs’ argument.              If prisoners are\n\ninherently “unpredictable,” as the district court found, then classification is not a\n\nreasonable way of integrating programs, because it does not reduce the risk of HIV\n\ntransmission.\n\n\n\n   19\n        (See, e.g., R.25 at 67-69; id. at 74; id. at 143-45 (Department of Corrections\nClassification Manual admitted as Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 1); R.27 at 127 (“cherry-picking” inmates\nis sound penological strategy); R.32 at 229 (“job board” classification system); R.34 at 210-213\n(classification procedure); R.35 at 208-230 (great detail concerning classification process).)\n\n                                               28\n\f      Because the plaintiffs thus did in fact successfully introduce classification\n\nevidence, and the district court implicitly considered the feasibility of classification,\n\nthe plaintiffs’ substantial rights were not affected by the court’s trial rulings, and no\n\nremand is required.

May excessive cost make a hardship undue?\n\n      Reasonable accommodations are mandatory only to the point that they impose\n\n“undue hardship” on the federal funds recipient. See, e.g., 29 C.F.R. § 32.3 (definition\n\nof “reasonable accommodation”); see also Willis v.

The plaintiffs’ primary proposed accommodation was for the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to hire enough guards to surveil the programs and prevent\n\nhigh-risk behavior. The district court found that the plaintiffs’ recommended level of\n\nsecurity staffing to be too low to prevent high-risk behavior, but implied that the\n\nDepartment of Corrections’ claimed necessary level of staffing—as many as 70\n\nadditional guards all together, a 23% increase—would adequately reduce the risk.\n\nThis level of staffing, the court concluded, would place an undue financial and\n\nadministrative burden on the already-strapped prison system.\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f      In challenging this conclusion, the plaintiffs complain primarily that the district\n\ncourt should not have considered cost at all.

According to the\n\nplaintiffs, the defendants did not carry their burden of proving that the addition of 70\n\nguards would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the programs to which the plaintiffs\n\nseek access, and that cost could not, therefore, have been an undue burden.\n\n      We reject the plaintiffs’ argument both because Zimring’s standard does not\n\napply here and because the district court’s findings are supported by sufficient\n\nevidence. Under the Rehabilitation Act, cost is relevant to the federal fund recipient’s\n\nburden when it, like any other burden, reaches the point of “undue hardship.” This\n\nis a consistent agency interpretation of the statute: Many (if not all) regulations\n\npromulgated under the Rehabilitation Act prescribe “undue hardship” as the standard\n\nfor measuring when the federal funds recipient’s burden is too much. See, e.g., 7\n\nC.F.R. § 15b.13(a) (Department of Agriculture); 28 C.F.R. § 42.511(a) (Department\n\nof Justice); 29 C.F.R. § 32.13(a) (Department of Labor); 34 C.F.R. § 104.12(a)\n\n(Department of Education); 45 C.F.R. § 84.12(a) (Department of Health and Human\n\n\n                                          30\n\fServices). And in all these regulations, determining “undue hardship” explicitly\n\nfactors in “the nature and cost of the accommodation.” 7 C.F.R. § 15b.13(b)(3); 28\n\nC.F.R. § 42.511(c); 29 C.F.R. § 32.13(b); 34 C.F.R. § 104.12(c); 45 C.F.R. § 84.12(c).\n\n      This circuit’s precedents, moreover, show that a hardship becomes undue long\n\nbefore it effects a “fundamental alteration” in employment conditions or reallocation\n\nof program resources.

Limestone’s\n\nwarden estimated that he would need around 25 additional officers to guard integrated\n\nprograms; Tutwiler’s warden estimated that she would need as many as 45 additional\n\nofficers to integrate all programs safely.20 The record shows that the cost of these 70\n\nadditional officers for their first year would be $1,713,810. The budget for the entire\n\nDepartment in fiscal 1994 was $163,000,000.                At the time of trial, this level of\n\nfunding left Limestone 35 correctional officers short and Tutwiler 89 short. The court\n\ncould conclude that in these circumstances spending an addition $1.7 million would\n\ncause undue hardship.\n\n        The plaintiffs assert to the contrary that their evidence of the Department of\n\nCorrections’ power to reallocate resources required the opposite conclusion. We\n\ndisagree, because the plaintiffs’ reliance on the Department’s authority to reallocate\n\n\n\n   20\n       There was testimony that because of vacation and sick time it takes 1.73 officers to fill\none eight-hour post; it is not clear if the wardens’ estimates were of posts or actual officers.\n\n                                                32\n\fresources rests on a legal equation of “undue hardship” with “impossibility.” As\n\nexplained just above, that is not the standard. The Rehabilitation Act does not require\n\nthe Department to do whatever it is legally capable of doing to accommodate the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n              3.    May a court consider the global burden of accommodations\n                    requested in different areas?\n\n       Here, the plaintiffs argue that the district court wrongly considered the burden\n\nto the Department of Corrections of accommodating the plaintiffs in every program\n\nthat required additional security to operate safely. According to the plaintiffs, the\n\ndistrict court should have picked and chosen among programs, selecting some for\n\naccommodations that, because of their smaller scale, would not be unduly\n\nburdensome. We reject this argument. While it may be true, as the plaintiffs assert,\n\nthat “[n]othing in § 504 permits federal funds recipients to take this ‘all or nothing’\n\nstand,” it was not the federal funds recipient here but the plaintiffs who insisted on\n\nhaving everything. The plaintiffs’ post-trial brief, for instance, made this argument\n\nwithout specifically identifying any programs that the plaintiff preferred to integrate\n\nover others, and the Complaint asks for integration in all programs. It was incumbent\n\non the plaintiffs, not the defendants or the court, to identify where they wanted partial\n\nrelief, if full relief were not possible. Cf. Blessing v.

Can providing “separate but equal” programs be a reasonable\n                       accommodation?\n\n          The plaintiffs’ fourth challenge to the court’s analysis we need not discuss in\n\ndetail.     They complain that the district court ruled that “separate but equal”\n\nprogramming — those programs such as adult basic education that were afforded both\n\nHIV-positive and -negative prisoners separately — is not a proper accommodation of\n\na disability. This argument is apparently new on appeal. Indeed, before the district\n\ncourt, the plaintiffs argued somewhat inconsistently that “separate but equal”\n\naccommodations were not only permissible under the Rehabilitation Act, but required\n\nby it. (R.5-526, at 161-62.) We decline to consider this newly raised issue.\n\n                                         III.

In the\nalternative, they argue that the case should be reassigned on remand. We conclude that the\nevidence of impropriety is insufficient to warrant recusal and vacatur of the judgment; we need\nnot consider reassignment because we do not remand.\n\n                                                 34\n\fBARKETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting, in which HATCHETT, Chief Judge, joins:\n\n      The issue before the court today is not an easy one. Prisons certainly have the\n\nobligation to prevent the spread of the HIV virus among inmates. At the same time\n\nthey have the obligation to protect the rights of prisoners already infected with the\n\nvirus. This difficult balancing act requires sensitivity to the rights of all prisoners\n\nwithin the state’s custody – both those infected with the disease and those who are not.\n\nBy upholding on this record Alabama’s policy of excluding HIV+ inmates from all\n\nthe programs and activities offered to inmates housed in the general population, the\n\nmajority permits Alabama to forego any consideration of the rights of HIV+ inmates\n\neven where the rights of uninfected inmates are not, in any real sense, endangered.\n\nThe majority upholds the blanket exclusion on the grounds that any cognizable risk\n\nof HIV transmission, no matter how infinitesimal and even if based on a wholly\n\nunlikely and speculative chain of events, suffices to disqualify HIV+ inmates from\n\nparticipating in all general population prison programs and that no reasonable\n\n\n                                          35\n\faccommodation could eliminate this risk. The majority’s holding is in direct conflict\n\nwith governing Supreme Court precedent and eviscerates § 504’s protections.\n\nMoreover, in affirming the judgment of the district court, the Court places its\n\nimprimatur on the district court’s failure to conduct a discrete analysis of the risk of\n\nHIV transmission in each of the many programs and activities at issue here in\n\nderogation of the specific mandate of this court. As a result, HIV+ inmates in\n\nAlabama are excluded from participating in a whole host of programs to which\n\nuninfected inmates routinely have access – programs and activities which comprise\n\nvirtually all features of institutional life – without any meaningful inquiry into whether\n\nthis stigmatizing exclusion is necessary to protect uninfected inmates from a\n\nsignificant risk of HIV transmission. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n      In School Board of Nassau County, Fla. v. Arline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111832\"><a href=\"/opinion/111832/school-bd-of-nassau-cty-v-arline/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), the\n\nSupreme Court made clear that recipients of federal aid are not entitled to demand\n\nabsolute segregation from individuals with contagious diseases; § 504 prohibits those\n\nreceiving federal moneys from unduly indulging their fears and requires them to\n\ntolerate less than significant risks of transmission. In Arline, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat a school teacher who was diagnosed with tuberculosis was a handicapped\n\nindividual within the meaning of § 504 and remanded the case for an “individualized\n\ninquiry” as to whether Arline could serve as a teacher without posing a significant risk\n\n\n                                           36\n\fof communicating her disease to her students. Id. at 287. Observing that “[f]ew\n\naspects of a handicap give rise to the same level of public fear and misapprehension\n\nas contagiousness,” the Court explained that § 504 was “carefully structured to replace\n\nsuch reflexive reactions . . . with actions based on reasoned and medically sound\n\njudgments. . . . The fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose\n\na serious health threat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding\n\nfrom the coverage of the Act all persons with actual or perceived contagious\n\ndiseases.” Id. at 284-85 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the Court held that an\n\nindividualized inquiry into risk was “essential if § 504 is to achieve its goal of\n\nprotecting handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes,\n\nor unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of\n\ngrantees as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.” Id. at 287.\n\n      In formulating the “significant risk” standard, the Court explained that “[a]\n\nperson who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others\n\nin the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable\n\naccommodation will not eliminate that risk.” Id. at 287 n.16. The Court instructed\n\nlower courts to look to objective medical evidence concerning four factors in\n\ndetermining whether a risk is significant: “(a) the nature of the risk (how the disease\n\nis transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the carrier infectious), (c) the\n\n\n                                            37\n\fseverity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third parties) and (d) the probabilities\n\nthe disease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm.” Id. at 288.\n\n\n\n       Focusing exclusively on Arline’s third factor, the majority holds that, because\n\nof its deadly consequences, any cognizable risk of HIV transmission is, as a matter of\n\nlaw, a significant risk. The majority purports to apply Arline, stating that “the\n\nsignificance of a risk is a product of the odds that transmission will occur and the\n\nseverity of the consequences,” Maj. op. at 13, but then proceeds to ignore all but the\n\nseverity of risk factor. The fatal consequences of a contagious disease, in the\n\nmajority’s view, suffice to render a transmission risk significant even if the\n\nprobabilities of transmission are so low as to approach zero, so long as transmission\n\ncould theoretically occur, letting one factor overwhelm the entire Arline analysis.\n\nAlthough it disclaims any intent of establishing an “any risk” standard, in fact the\n\nmajority opinion does exactly that. By focusing only on possibilities – whether “a\n\ncertain event can occur” and whether “the event can transmit the disease,” Maj. op.\n\nat 16 (emphasis added) – the majority requires a plaintiff to prove that transmission\n\nis impossible. This reasoning conflicts with Arline’s explicit directive to consider\n\nother relevant factors and is directly contrary to the Supreme Court’s recent decision\n\nin Bragdon v.

It bears noting that\n\nthe Supreme Court specifically rejected the very argument the majority adopts today.\n\nBragdon declined to permit discriminatory treatment of those afflicted with the HIV\n\nvirus based on an “any risk” standard, explaining that “[b]ecause few, if any, activities\n\nin life are risk free, Arline and the ADA do not ask whether a risk exists, but whether\n\nit is significant.” Id. at 2210. Thus, the “significant risk” analysis begins with the\n\nexistence of a risk of transmission, but it does not end there. “The question under the\n\nstatute,” the Court stated, was “one of statistical likelihood” based on an “objective\n\nassessment of the risks posed . . . .” Id. at 2211-12. Indeed, in Bragdon, the Court\n\nrejected the dissent’s argument that a significant risk of HIV transmission existed\n\nbased on instances of possible transmission of HIV from patients to dental and other\n\nhealthcare workers, finding that this evidence of possible transmission was\n\ninsufficient to establish “the objective, scientific basis for finding a significant risk to\n\nthe petitioner.” Id. at 2212.

Applying Arline,\n\nwe rejected the district court’s conclusion that a “remote theoretical possibility” of\n\ntransmission through tears, saliva, and urine were sufficient to support segregated\n\nschooling. This possibility, we explained, “does not rise to the ‘significant’ risk level\n\nthat is required for Eliana to be excluded from the regular . . . classroom.” Id. at 1506.\n\nDespite the lethal consequences of the plaintiff’s AIDS, we found that the risk of\n\ntransmission occurring in this manner was too remote and speculative to constitute a\n\n“significant risk” under Arline.

However, different programs present different levels of risk of\n\nsuch behavior occurring. The prior mandate of this court recognized this distinction\n\nby requiring that the district court evaluate each program in terms of the risks\n\ninvolved. For example, the risks of residential integration differ from the risks of\n\nintegrating a religious service or an educational class. Even where an established\n\ntransmission pathway is involved, a risk of HIV transmission must be evaluated on\n\nobjective evidence of the likelihood of transmission and the other Arline factors, not\n\non mere speculation. Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, this standard does not\n\ndemand that someone die before a risk is considered significant.

It is one thing to say that objective evidence of a small risk of transmission\n\nof a deadly, contagious disease entails a significant risk in a particular context. It is\n\nquite another to say, as the majority does, that the probability of transmission is\n\nirrelevant so long as transmission is theoretically possible.\n\n      In this case, the district court asked only whether there was a risk of HIV\n\ntransmission, equating a mere possibility of HIV transmission with the significant risk\n\nrequired for exclusion. No separate analysis of each program weighing the different\n\nrisks involved and the likelihood of transmission was conducted to determine whether\n\nplaintiffs were otherwise qualified to participate in any of them. In program after\n\nprogram, the district court concluded that integration would pose a significant risk,\n\nrelying on and repeating verbatim the following paragraph thirty-nine times in the\n\ncourse of its opinion to justify its holding that the HIV+ inmates were not “otherwise\n\nqualified” to participate in any general population programs:\n\n\n                                           42\n\f       The Court of Appeals recognized in Harris, 941 F.2d at 1495, 1519-20\n       that “high risk behavior occurs disproportionately in prison systems” and\n       that “under any system of prison administration, the elimination of high\n       risk behavior, such as homosexual behavior or IV drug use is\n       impossible.” This Court, too, recognizes that elimination of high risk\n       behavior is impossible.

In its analysis of these\n\nprograms and activities, the district court assumed that high-risk behavior would\n\neventually occur, explaining time and again that prison officials must expect the\n\nunexpected, thereby “allow[ing] the DOC to . . . guard against contingencies which,\n\nunder normal circumstances, would be considered only remote possibilities.” Op. at\n\n58. This rejection of evidence in favor of sheer speculation is reflected, for example,\n\nin the district court’s discussion of the out-of-prison programs.3                        Although\n\nacknowledging the evidence that “surveillance by a correctional officer would likely\n\nprevent [high-risk] behavior,” Op. at 152, in some of these programs, the district court\n\njustified its conclusion by constructing the following hypothetical:\n\n       [I]n the prison system, one must always be prepared for the unexpected.\n       An automobile or other accident may incapacitate a guard and leave the\n       inmates on the out-of-prison detail free to proceed without an escort. An\n\n\n   2\n     The majority, too, makes this error, affirming the district court based on evidence on high-\nrisk behavior in the prison system as a whole, not in each program as Harris required.\n   3\n    These programs permit inmates to leave prison, generally in handcuffs, under direct\nsurveillance of prison guards, to talk to school children about the perils of drug use, to attend a\nfuneral or seek medical care, or to work outside the institution fence.\n\n                                                 44\n\f      inmate, temporarily healthy but facing the bleak future of all sero-\n      positives, may have controlling impulses vastly different from those of\n      healthy inmates who may be more concerned about the penal aspects of\n      their future. . . .\n\n      If . . . a correctional officer has been incapacitated in an accident, a\n      female inmate with contempt for that officer could purposely implant,\n      while the guard remains unconscious, blood containing HIV organisms\n      from the HIV+ inmates open wounds. An unconscious guard would be\n      defenseless, and would perhaps never be fully aware of how the infection\n      was contracted. The unexpected must be expected in a penal setting or\n      when dealing with convicted felons.\n\nOp. at 153 (footnotes omitted).\n\n      As this passage illustrates, the district court’s analysis found that a mere\n\npossibility of a transmission risk, often based on nothing more than highly speculative\n\nscenarios, justifies the wholesale segregation and exclusion of HIV+ inmates from\n\nprison programs and activities. Under this reasoning, which the majority approves,\n\nan individual is, in essence, subject to segregation and discriminatory treatment simply\n\nfor having the HIV virus. This is precisely the result that\n\n§ 504 and Arline’s “significant risk” standard sought to prevent.\n\n      Nor are the cases cited by the majority to support its refusal to follow Bragdon\n\napplicable. These cases uphold the authority of hospitals to prohibit HIV+ physicians\n\nand surgical technicians from performing certain invasive surgical procedures based\n\non public health guidance authority absent here.

First, these cases were decided before Bragdon explained the distinction\n\nbetween a risk of HIV-transmission and a “significant risk.” Second, none of these\n\ncases hold that any risk of HIV transmission – no matter how small or remote – is a\n\nsignificant risk as a matter of law. In Mauro, Doe, and Bradley, the courts explicitly\n\nrelied on the guidance of public health officials to support their finding of a significant\n\nrisk and Bragdon teaches us that “the views of public health authorities,” such as the\n\nCenters for Disease Control (“CDC”), “are of special weight and authority.” Bragdon,\n\n118 S. Ct. at 2211. In Doe, for example, the court emphasized that the CDC had\n\nstated that “hospitals may bar HIV-positive surgeons from performing those\n\nprocedures identified by the hospital as exposure prone” and the university concluded\n\nthat “all neurosurgical procedures that would be performed by Dr. Doe fit the\n\ndefinition of exposure-prone procedures . . . .” Doe, 50 F.3d at 1266 (emphasis in\n\noriginal); see also Mauro, 137 F.3d at 404 (“defer[ring] to the medical judgment\n\nexpressed in the Report of the Centers for Disease Control”); Bradley, 3 F.3d at 924\n\n(relying on CDC guidelines). These cases, therefore, conclude, based on explicit CDC\n\nguidance, that a small risk of transmission in that particular context amounts to a\n\n“significant risk.” The record below does not contain any such guidelines or similar\n\nevidence. Moreover, the only testimony below in support of Alabama’s policy\n\n\n                                            46\n\fconsists of the opinions of corrections officials and none comes from any public\n\nhealth entity unconnected with the parties.\n\n      I likewise believe the majority errs in holding that plaintiffs were not “otherwise\n\nqualified” within the meaning of § 504 because of the prison’s penological interests\n\nin excluding them from the many programs and activities at issue here. In Harris, our\n\nmandate made clear that the prison’s penological interests supporting the segregation\n\nof HIV+ prisoners were not automatically sufficient to render plaintiffs unqualified,\n\nthereby declining to insulate the Alabama prison authorities from liability under the\n\nRehabilitation Act. We explained that\n\n      it is not enough for the district court simply to rely on general findings\n      and prison policy reasons that support segregation. . . . We . . . do not\n      believe . . . that the prison’s choice of blanket segregation should alone\n      insulate the DOC from its affirmative obligation under the Act to pursue\n      and implement such alternative, reasonable accommodations as are\n      possible for HIV-positive prisoners with respect to various programs and\n      activities that are available to the prison populations at large.\n\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1527 (footnote omitted).\n\n      Under § 504, the “otherwise qualified” analysis focuses on the requirements of\n\nthe program at issue and whether reasonable accommodations would permit the\n\nplaintiff to participate, see Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 n.17, not whether the\n\ndiscriminatory exclusion is supported by legitimate goals, penological or otherwise.\n\nAs Harris makes clear, a § 504 plaintiff is not rendered unqualified to participate in\n\n\n                                          47\n\fa prison program simply because the prison asserts general penological interests in\n\nexcluding him or her from participation.\n\n      This is not to say that penological concerns have no place in a § 504 analysis.\n\nAs the Seventh Circuit has explained, “[t]erms like ‘reasonable’ and ‘undue’ are\n\nrelative to circumstances, and the circumstances of a prison are different from those\n\nof a school, an office, or a factory,” and “[t]he security concerns that the defendant\n\nrightly emphasizes . . . are highly relevant to determining the feasibility of the\n\naccommodations that disabled prisoners need in order to have access to desired\n\nprograms and services.” Crawford v.

Distancing itself from the district court’s statement that hiring even\n\na single officer would impose an undue burden, the majority unfairly characterizes the\n\nrelief requested by the plaintiffs as integration of all the programs and activities\n\nchallenged here, which it asserts would require hiring many additional officers. As\n\nthe majority must concede, the inability to accommodate plaintiffs in all the programs\n\nand activities would not justify Alabama’s refusal to provide accommodation in any\n\nof the programs and activities at issue here. The majority nonetheless affirms the\n\ndistrict court because plaintiffs did not specify which programs and activities they\n\nwould prefer to integrate. This begs the question since the district court failed to\n\nconduct the correct inquiry into each program as to whether integration would pose\n\na significant risk and what measures would be required to accommodate plaintiffs.\n\nThus, this question should also be remanded for a proper evidentiary hearing.\n\n\n\n   4\n    I would note that both the Supreme Court and this Court have repeatedly recognized that §\n504 requires covered recipients to make reasonable accommodations to permit individuals with\ndisabilities to participate in programs offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance. See\nAlexander v. Choate, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300-01 (1985); Harris, 941 F.2d at 1525-27; Martinez, 861\nF.2d at 1505-07. Thus, I find no basis for the majority’s suggestion that the § 504 imposes no\nreasonable accommodation mandate and that the source of any duty to provide reasonable\naccommodations comes solely from the applicable agency regulations.\n\n                                                 49\n\f      Second, by rejecting the use of the prison risk classification system as a\n\nreasonable accommodation because it is not error free, the majority once again\n\nrequires a plaintiff to prove that he or she can not possibly transmit the HIV virus,\n\nthereby equating any possible transmission risk with the significant risk required to\n\nsupport exclusion under Arline and Bragdon. It may well be that the prison risk\n\nclassification system will not suffice to reduce the risk of transmission resulting from\n\nintegration to a less than significant one. At this point, however, the record is\n\ninadequate to establish the rate of error in the classification program in accordance\n\nwith Arline’s dictates. The district court excluded much, though not all, of the\n\nevidence about this classification scheme and the district court only found that this\n\nsystem was not error free. It made no findings regarding the likelihood of error.\n\nAccordingly, I believe that the district court’s exclusion of evidence on this point\n\nrequires a new trial.\n\n      I would note that it is significant that Alabama prison authorities use this\n\nselection process despite the possibility of error in the risk classification system and\n\ndespite the tragic, and even fatal, consequences of error, which have in fact occurred.\n\nThe majority offers no explanation why the prison system should be entitled to insist\n\nits risk classification system work in an error-free manner in the HIV context, and this\n\ncontext alone. Further, it appears that Alabama does not impose a similar policy of\n\n\n                                          50\n\fsegregation and exclusion where other inmates have other contagious diseases, such\n\nas hepatitis.\n\n       Congress and the Supreme Court have recognized that automatic expulsion and\n\nexclusion from society because of          “health risks” have historically masked\n\ndiscrimination against individuals with contagious diseases based on prejudice and\n\nbaseless fear. Certainly, care must be taken to minimize risk of infection, but care\n\nmust just as certainly be taken to assure that a society that aspires to be just does not\n\nmake outcasts of its stricken citizens. In this case, no fair assessment of the risks\n\ninvolved was conducted and no fair consideration was given to reasonable\n\naccommodations which could have minimized to an acceptable level those risks which\n\ndid exist. No balancing of rights occurred here. Thus, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\fHULL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       I respectfully dissent. The district court’s decision should be vacated and the\n\ncase retried because the district court refused to consider applying Alabama’s inmate\n\nrisk classification system as a reasonable accommodation, denied plaintiffs a fair trial,\n\nand failed to follow this Court’s mandate in the prior appeal of this case, Harris\n\nv.Thigpen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566783\"><a href=\"/opinion/566783/carmen-jean-harris-and-leslie-john-pettway-james-hollifield-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n       I agree with the majority that requiring more prison guards to prevent high-risk\n\nbehavior by inmates is an “undue burden” and that federal courts should not run\n\nAlabama’s prisons, much less micro-manage the state’s prison budget.

Majority Acknowledges District Court’s Errors\n\n         The majority acknowledges the district court’s errors in not following the Harris\n\npanel’s mandate and in not allowing plaintiffs to introduce evidence regarding inmate\n\nrisk classification as a reasonable accommodation. The majority states:\n\n         (1) that “[t]he Harris panel directed the district court to consider reasonable\n\naccommodations, see Harris, 941 F.2d at 1527,” and that “[t]he Harris panel directed\n\nthe district court on remand to consider whether reasonable accommodations would\n\npermit the plaintiffs to participate in any of the programs at issue. See Harris, 941\n\nF.2d at 1527.”3\n\n\n\n\n     2\n   In holding that Title II of the ADA applies to state prisons, the Supreme Court noted that\n“[m]odern prisons provide inmates with many recreational ‘activities,’ medical ‘services,’ and\neducational and vocational ‘programs,’ all of which at least theoretically ‘benefit’ the prisoners.”\nPennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1955 (1998).\n     3\n    Indeed, the Harris panel expressly stated that the district court on remand should “examine as\nto each [prison] program whether ‘reasonable accommodations’ by the DOC could minimize\nsuch [HIV] risk to an acceptable level.” Id. at 1527. The Harris panel expressly directed that\n“whether the risk of [HIV] transmission is sufficient to warrant categorical exclusion, and if so,\nwhether that risk can be rendered minimal through accommodation, are findings the district court\nmust make on remand.” Id. at 1527 n.47. The Harris panel remanded for “full findings of fact\nand conclusions of law as to each program and activity from which HIV-positive prisoners are\nbeing excluded, and a proper weighing of the dangers of transmission in each context.” Id. at\n1527.\n\n                                                53\n\f      (2) “that the Harris panel sensibly concluded that differences among the\n\nprograms in which the plaintiffs seek to participate required different analyses. See\n\nHarris, 941 F.2d at 1527.”\n\n      (3) that “one reasonable accommodation that the plaintiffs proposed was for the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to refine existing systems of inmate classification to detect\n\nHIV-positive inmates who were highly unlikely to engage in high-risk behavior and\n\nto permit those inmates to participate in integrated programming. At trial, however,\n\neach time the defendants objected to classification evidence, the district court\n\nexcluded it on the reasoning that any evidence tending to be about individual inmates\n\n– even if the evidence concerned inmate classification systems in general – was\n\noutside the scope of the retrial mandated by this court”; and,\n\n      (4) that “[t]he district court should not, therefore, have excluded the plaintiffs’\n\nevidence about classification, and it should have considered classification as a\n\nreasonable accommodation.” So far, so good. The majority then wrongly concludes\n\nthat these errors do not require reversal.\n\nB.    Majority Wrongly Concludes Errors Do Not Require Reversal\n\n      The majority finds these new errors do not require reversal because some\n\nevidence about classification leaked in through the exclusion and the district court’s\n\nfinding that prisoners are “unpredictable” was “implicitly” a consideration and\n\n\n                                             54\n\frejection of inmate risk classification as a reasonable accommodation. I disagree for\n\nseveral reasons.\n\n       First, the record shows unequivocally that at trial the district court refused to\n\nconsider inmate classification as a reasonable accommodation for any program and\n\nrefused to admit plaintiffs’ substantial evidence about inmate classification. For\n\nexample, in one instance, the court explained, “I did not let [plaintiffs’ expert witness]\n\ngo into the fact that there were some inmates that perhaps could be cleared for certain\n\nof these programs and others cannot. Because this is a class action not composed of\n\na division between those type people.” R.26 at 15. For other similar comments, see\n\nR.24 at 290 (“Well, you now want to say that you want to introduce evidence that\n\nthere are some people in the class of HIVs who are excluded that ought not to be\n\nexcluded. And . . . that is not an issue in this case and I mustn’t get into it.”); id. at\n\n291 (“. . . I am going to make you stick to the whole class unless the other side says\n\nthey are ready to defend on less than the whole class.”); id. at 299 (“[W]e don’t get\n\nto look at it from the viewpoint of singling out some HIV, who is the best of all the\n\nrest, like some people have done in cases.”); id. at 300 (“I am not going to let you\n\noffer all this business about what people you can break down and what people you\n\ncan’t. It is a class and it is a class action, and that is the way it is going to be tried.”);\n\nR.26. at 18 (“. . . I followed, or think I followed, the order of the court of appeals that\n\n\n                                             55\n\fI consider these matters particularized as to programs and activities but not as to\n\npersons. And you have tried to make it a proceeding wherein you particularize . . .\n\nor I would have to particularized [sic] my findings between persons; individual\n\npersons.”); id. at 19 (“[Y]ou might as well quit. You are keeping your expert here\n\nunnecessarily to go through a great number of words that really lead back to the\n\nquestion of whether I am supposed to have a hearing considering the rights of a class\n\nor of individual members of the class. And I understand that I am here to consider the\n\nrights of the class; not individual members of it. And I have so restrained you where\n\nI could.”); id. (“[Y]ou are trying to get me to break the class down into individualized\n\nclaims, which I can’t do.”).\n\n        Second, the majority incorrectly contends that substantial evidence about the\n\ninmate classification process leaked in through the exclusion. The majority lists this\n\n“substantial evidence” in footnote 19. A review of all record cites in footnote 19\n\nreveals that the evidence that leaked in consisted of only one manual and less than\n\nthirty pages of testimony in a thirteen-volume, 3654-page trial transcript. Moreover,\n\nthe district court expressly refused to consider such evidence that leaked in and even\n\nstruck some of it from the record.4\n\n   4\n    In at least one instance, the district court clarified that it would not consider the classification\nevidence that had leaked in, and the court directed that the testimony be struck from the record.\nR.34 at 214. Plaintiffs’ attorney then inquired, “Am I understanding correctly that . . . any\ninformation about determining which inmates are likely to engage in high risk behavior, meaning\n\n                                                  56\n\f       Moreover, the district court refused to admit the substantial evidence plaintiffs\n\ndid proffer. Here is but one example of plaintiffs’ proffers:\n\n              Plaintiffs, also offer to prove that classification is a traditional tool\n       of prison management by which the Alabama DOC, like all other DOCs,\n       makes distinctions among inmates, and that the classification process is\n       done [on] an individual basis, inmate by inmate.\n              We would offer to prove that in making those classification\n       decisions the DOC looks at the inmate’s criminal history institutional\n       disciplinary history, psychological tests administered by the staff\n       psychologist and similar factors; a team of people come together for each\n       inmate to make the classification assessment, a person from\n       Classification, a psychologist, a warden or assistant warden. And that\n       classification process includes precisely an assessment of whether the\n       inmate poses a significant risk of harming other inmates or other staff on\n       an inmate-by-inmate or individual basis.\n              And we would prove that, in fact, the Alabama classification\n       process expressly addresses the factor of whether an inmate as [sic]\n       aggressive homosexual. That is, the DOC’s classification process\n       already addresses some of the behavior related to transmission of HIV\n       and it would be a reasonable accommodation to have . . . to use that\n       classification system to qualify inmates with HIV for programs and\n       activities.\n              We would offer to prove that using the information that the\n       classification team is in a position to gather in the course of it[s] duties,\n       the classification process result in the assignments of a custody level to\n       an inmate ranging from community custody to minimum-in, to\n       minimum-out, to trustee, to medium, to close, to maximum. And,\n       moreover, that the classification team makes recommendations about\n       programs that the inmate should participate in, including rehabilitation\n       programs, education, trade school and community jobs. The DOC\n       institutional job board then actually looks at the classification materials\n       and makes an assessment on and an assignment. And this assignment is\n\nculling the good from the bad, will not be allowed?”, to which the court responded, “That is\ncorrect. That is a fairly good analysis of it. . . . Now I will let you ask and I will try to rule\nagainst you if you ask the wrong questions. I won’t tell you you can’t ask.” R.34 at 216.\n\n                                                  57\n\f       on an individualized basis of inmates to trade school, community job and\n       other job assignments.\n              Our proof would be that the DOC institutional job board already\n       selects among general population inmates and decides that some of them\n       and not others will participate in particular programs.\n              The plaintiff’s proof would address these facts. Plaintiff’s\n       position is that the same selection and screening process that is already\n       applied to general population inmates through the institutional job board\n       could be utilized, possibly with enhanced factors, to determine who may\n       participate in particular jobs and other programs.\n              Plaintiffs would offer to prove that other jurisdictions have\n       devised classification systems for HIV positive inmates by which the\n       issue of whether an inmate poses a significant risk of transmission is\n       determined on an individualized basis inmate-by-inmate as part of its\n       classification system, and that this would be a reasonable thing for\n       Alabama to do.\n              We would show that the Federal Bureau of Prisons has a system\n       by which inmates who engage in high risk activity are segregated and\n       remain segregated until an assessment is made that an inmate has\n       rehabilitated himself such that he no longer poses a risk of transmission.\n\nR.26 at 15-18. The district court repeatedly refused to allow plaintiffs to present such\n\nproof.5\n\n       Even if a paucity of evidence about classification, as I find, or “substantial\n\nevidence,” as the majority finds, leaked in through the exclusion, the district court’s\n\nerrors still require reversal because the district court refused to consider such evidence\n\nand never made any findings of fact or legal analysis about inmate classification as a\n\n“reasonable accommodation.” The majority finds that the district court “implicitly”\n\n\n   5\n   See, e.g., R.24 at 289-91; id. at 299-300; R.26 at 15-20; R.34 at 214-15; R.35 at 214; id. at\n215; id. at 220; id. at 222; id. at 227; id. at 228; id. at 230; id. at 231.\n\n                                                58\n\fdid so because the district court found inmates are “unpredictable.” The majority’s\n\nanalysis on this point is as follows:\n\n      The [district] court found that inmates are “untrustworth[y],”\n      “volatil[e],” “unpredictable,” and subject to “great pressures from\n      conflicting sources.” . . . Therefore, the court found, prison officials must\n      always “prepare[] for the worst” and “expect the unexpected.” (Id. at 57,\n      58.) These findings are an implicit rejection of plaintiffs’ arguments. If\n      prisoners are inherently “unpredictable,” as the district court found, then\n      classification is not a reasonable way of integrating programs, because\n      it does not reduce the risk of HIV transmission.\n\nI respectfully submit that the district court’s finding that prisoners are “unpredictable”\n\nis not an “implicit rejection” of plaintiffs’ classification arguments and does not show\n\nthat “the district court implicitly considered the feasibility of classification.”\n\nPrisoners’ being “unpredictable” is no factual finding – much less a legal analysis –\n\nabout whether inmate classification is a reasonable accommodation for at least some\n\nHIV-positive inmates for at least certain prison programs.\n\n      Finally, this is no first appeal where “implicit” district court findings might be\n\njustifiably found by an appellate court from an ambiguous record. This is the second\n\nappeal after the Harris panel’s decision reversed, expressly directed the district court\n\nto consider reasonable accommodations, and remanded “for additional findings and\n\nclarification by the district court.” Id. at 1528. Rather than requiring the district court\n\nto make the legal analysis or factual findings required by the Harris mandate, the\n\nmajority wrongly excuses the district court’s errors by finding that the district court\n\n                                            59\n\fsomehow “implicitly” did what it plainly did not do and expressly in the record\n\nrefused to do.\n\nC.     Errors Affected a Core Issue and Denied Plaintiffs a Fair Trial\n\n       There is justifiable reluctance to reverse and remand once again for a new trial\n\nin this protracted case. But a retrial is required because the district court’s clear errors\n\naffected a core issue in the case and substantially prejudiced the plaintiffs’ trial. By\n\nnegating one of plaintiffs’ principal claims – namely, that applying the DOC’s inmate\n\nrisk classification system would allow at least some HIV-positive prisoners to be\n\naccommodated reasonably in certain prison programs – the district court drew into\n\nquestion its judgment with respect to each prison program for which plaintiffs\n\nsuggested individualized risk assessment as a reasonable accommodation.\n\n       Although appellate courts should refrain from second-guessing prison officials\n\nand district courts in their difficult jobs, appellate courts should assure the\n\nfundamental right to a fair trial. The Harris panel aptly concluded that “it may turn\n\nout that the court’s conclusion of the significance of the risk of HIV transmission with\n\nregard to each program will be unaltered.” Harris at 1526. I likewise do not predict\n\nthe result of a fair trial – but know only that plaintiffs were denied one.\n\n       In conclusion, the district court did not follow the Harris panel’s mandate, erred\n\nin precluding much of plaintiffs’ evidence regarding inmate risk classification, erred\n\n\n                                            60\n\fin refusing to consider the evidence that leaked in regarding inmate risk classification,\n\nand erred in refusing to consider inmate risk classification as a reasonable\n\naccommodation. Respectfully, I would vacate the district court’s decision and remand\n\nthis case for a new trial.6 Because I find that remand for a new trial is required, I do\n\nnot reach the other issues presented by this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n    It is noteworthy that the Harris panel aptly observed, “Intuitively, however, it seems as if\nthere are several programs or activities in which the risk of transmission would be rather\nminimal. An example is the participation of seropositive prisoners in college classes.” Harris,\n941 F.2d at 1527 n.47. Intuitively, it does seem as if there are at least a few programs, such as\nreligious services and college classes, where the transmission by non-violent seropositive\noffenders with no history of high-risk behavior or aggressive behavioral problems would be so\nremote or non-existent as to allow integration as opposed to blanket segregation. This is\nespecially true given that the profile of a state’s inmates is usually as diverse as that of a state’s\npopulation: male and female, of all races and creeds, college educated and illiterate, with or\nwithout high school diplomas, rich and poor, and guilty of crimes ranging from mass murders to\nnon-violent credit card fraud. Likewise, the causes of inmates’ HIV-positive status are equally\nvaried and range from transmissions from mother to fetus during pregnancy or childbirth,\ntransfusions during operations, and consensual marital sexual relations to intravenous drug use,\nneedle-sharing, and other high-risk behavior. Some prisoners have a history of no high-risk\nbehavior while other inmates have just the opposite history. This further exemplifies why the\ndistrict court’s errors in excluding plaintiffs’ evidence denied plaintiffs a fair trial.\n\n                                                  61\n\f</pre>",
