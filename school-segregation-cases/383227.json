This is a review of an\n\nunpublished     decision    of   the   court       of   appeals1      reversing       a\ndecision and order of the Dane County Circuit Court2 issuing a\n\nharassment     injunction    against    defendant         Jeffrey       S.     Decker\n\npursuant to Wis. Stat. § 813.125 (2009-10).3\n\n\n      1\n       Board of Regents v. Decker, No. 2011AP2902, unpublished\nslip op. (Wis. Ct.

Markson presiding.\n      3\n       All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to\nthe 2009-10 version unless otherwise indicated.\n\f                                                                           No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶2      The question before us is whether the circuit court\n\nproperly     granted      a    harassment         injunction        under    Wis.        Stat.\n\n§ 813.125,    Wisconsin's        harassment            injunction     statute.       Decker\n\nargues that (1) Wis. Stat. § 813.125 does not extend protection\n\nto institutions; (2) his behavior did not constitute harassment\n\nunder the statute; and (3) the harassment injunction granted by\n\nthe circuit court was overbroad and vague. The Board of Regents\n\nconcedes4 that the injunction was overbroad but asserts that Wis.\n\nStat. § 813.125 protects institutions as well as people, and\n\nfurther argues that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and\n\nlacked a legitimate purpose.\n\n    ¶3      We     hold       that    Wis.        Stat.     § 813.125        can     extend\n\ninjunctive       protection      to    institutions          as     well     as     natural\n\npersons. We further hold that the circuit court's decision to\n\ngrant   a   harassment        injunction         was   a   proper    exercise       of    its\n\ndiscretion, and sufficient evidence existed for the court to\n\nfind that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and lacked a\n\nlegitimate    purpose.        However,       because       the    parties        agree    the\ninjunction was overbroad, we remand to the circuit court to\n\nrefine the injunction and clarify its terms. For these reasons,\n\nthe decision of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause\n\nis remanded to the circuit court.\n\n\n\n\n    4\n       This court is \"not bound by the parties' interpretation of\nthe law or obligated to accept a party's concession of law.\"\nState v.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n      ¶4      Jeffrey S. Decker (\"Decker\") is a former student of\n\nthe University of Wisconsin—Stevens Point (\"UWSP\"). On August\n\n13,   2010,    Decker     met   with   the   UWSP    Chancellor,     Dr.   Bernie\n\nPatterson,     in   the    Chancellor's      office      to   discuss    Decker's\n\nconcerns regarding segregated fees charged to students.5 During\n\nthe meeting, Decker became agitated and began to talk about\n\nuniversity employees in a derogatory manner. Decker also swore\n\nat    the   Chancellor      and   threatened        to   interfere      with   the\n\nChancellor's upcoming State of the University address and donor\n\nfunction if his demands were not met.6 As tensions escalated\n\nduring the meeting, Decker reached for a stack of papers on the\n\nChancellor's conference table. The Chancellor informed Decker\n\nthe papers did not belong to him and tried to pull the documents\n\naway, but Decker yanked the papers back and forcibly stabbed\n\n\n      5\n       Segregated fees are \"charges in addition to instructional\nfees assessed to all students for services, programs and\nfacilities that support the primary mission of the university.\"\nSegregated   Fees   Information,   Office   of   the   Registrar,\nhttp://registrar.wisc.edu/segregated_fees_information.htm   (last\nvisited Dec. 24, 2013). Decker believes that university\nofficials must consult student government prior to assessing\nsegregated fees.\n      6\n       Decker sent several emails to the Chancellor prior to\ntheir meeting. For instance, on August 4, 2010, Decker emailed\nthe Chancellor regarding segregated fees and stated, \"There is\nonly one answer to the question I pose, and unless you answer it\nby 9 am tomorrow I will embarrass you before your peers for\nbeing in charge of an utterly corrupt and despicable scheme.\" On\nAugust 5, 2010, Decker wrote, \"It'll be a few hours before you\ndiscover how I've chosen to embarrass you personally for your\nnew role in this scam. Just because I believe in fairness and\nopportunity, here's this second notice.\"\n\n                                        3\n\f                                                          No.   2011AP2902\n\n\n\nthem with a pen. The Chancellor then called the police to remove\n\nDecker from his office.7 The Chancellor returned to his office\n\napproximately thirty minutes later and found the following note:\n\n    Threat: Due to rampant violations of of [sic] state\n    law, ethical and professional standards and multiple\n    commitments for communication, I shall soon demand the\n    resignation of Kevin Reily [sic] and Bernie Patterson,\n    or a dragon shall do it for all students. Jef Decker\n    ¶5     As a result of Decker's behavior during his meeting\n\nwith the Chancellor, Decker was brought before a Nonacademic\nDisciplinary   Committee   (\"the   Committee\"),   which     found    that\n\nDecker had engaged in Disorderly Conduct in violation of Wis.\n\nAdmin. Code § 18.11(2).8 The Committee suspended Decker from UWSP\n\n\n    7\n       Decker provided a slightly different version of events in\na written statement he made to UWSP Police. Decker claims he\ninformed the Chancellor that he would demand the resignation of\nUW System President Kevin Reilly \"from within a giant dragon\ncostume.\" Decker maintains that the Chancellor reacted by\n\"visibly shaking with rage\" and vowing to document Decker's\nthreats. Decker alleges he then offered to write down his\nstatements for the Chancellor on a packet of papers in front of\nDecker. As Decker began to write, Vice Chancellor Bob Tomlinson,\nwho was also present at the meeting, attempted to remove\nDecker's pen from the papers. Decker resisted and applied more\npressure to the pen as the Chancellor seized the papers,\nresulting in the papers becoming crumpled.\n    8\n        Wisconsin Admin. Code § UWS 18.11(2) states:\n\n    No person may engage in violent, abusive, indecent,\n    profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud or otherwise\n    disorderly conduct under circumstances in which the\n    conduct tends to cause or provoke a disturbance, in\n    university buildings or on university lands.\n\nWisconsin Admin. Code § UWS 17.09(14) provides university\nofficials with disciplinary authority over students in\nviolation of Chapter 18.\n\n                                   4\n\f                                                                        No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nfor the period of November 19, 2010, through January 1, 2012. At\n\nthe   end    of   the     disciplinary         meeting,     Decker      informed     the\n\nCommittee     that   he    had     no    intention     of      complying      with   the\n\nsuspension.\n\n      ¶6     Decker was true to his word. University of Wisconsin\n\n(\"UW\")      regulations     provide       that     a      suspended       student     is\n\nprohibited from being \"present on any campus without the written\n\nconsent of the chief administrative officer of that campus.\"\n\nWis. Admin. Code § UWS 17.17(4).9 Nevertheless, Decker continued\n\nto enter university property on at least four separate occasions\n\nafter he was suspended, which are described in detail below.10\n\n      ¶7     On January 22, 2011, Decker requested permission from\n\nChancellor     Richard     Wells    of    UW-Oshkosh      to    enter    the    campus,\n\n\n      9\n       Decker later testified before the circuit court that\napproximately one week after his suspension, he \"became aware\nthat the university's position was that Administrative Code\n17.17 prohibited me from being on campus.\" Decker also stated,\n\"it's clear based on my actions after [the suspension], that I\ndo not regard the Administrative Code to be lawful in a free\ncountry where public property can be accessed by citizens of\nthis great land.\"\n      10\n       Although the Board of Regents chronicles only four\nincidents in which Decker entered UW property after his\nsuspension, Decker was charged with two additional violations of\nWis. Admin. Code § UWS 18.11(7)(a), which prohibits suspended\nstudents from entering university lands. The first charge\nstemmed from conduct occurring on February 15, 2011, in\nWinnebago County, and was dismissed on May 9, 2011. The second\ncharge related to conduct occurring on October 12, 2011, in\nWinnebago County, and Decker was convicted after a bench trial\non January 26, 2012. In addition, although only one of the\nincidents described by the Board of Regents occurred on the UW-\nOshkosh campus, Decker testified before the circuit court that\nhe had been at UW-Oshkosh \"several times\" since his suspension.\n\n                                           5\n\f                                                                        No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nwhich was denied. In spite of Wells' denial, Decker went to an\n\nintercollegiate basketball game at UW-Oshkosh and distributed\n\nliterature to attendees.\n\n       ¶8     On   September      1,    2011,     Decker     entered    UW-Fox    Valley\n\nproperty to attend a meeting between members of the UW student\n\ngovernment      and    Ray     Cross,       the   UW   Colleges   and       UW-Extension\n\nChancellor.11 Decker interrupted the meeting while the Chancellor\n\nwas    posing      a   question        to    student    government      members.       The\n\nChancellor      asked    Decker        to    leave,    but    Decker    continued       to\n\ndisrupt the meeting. The Chancellor then asked a colleague to\n\ncall    the   police     and    apologetically          explained      to    Decker:    \"I\n\nreally hate to do this. If you had remained quiet, Jeff, I\n\nwouldn’t have done that.\" Decker responded by admonishing the\n\nChancellor for not returning his phone calls, at which point the\n\nChancellor started to leave the meeting. A student then asked\n\nDecker to remain silent: \"Mr. Decker, this is our time to visit\n\nwith the Chancellor. . . . I think it would be respectful if we\n\ncould spend our time with him. We don’t get a whole lot of\ntime.\"\n\n       ¶9     Decker promised to be quiet, then after a brief pause,\n\nhe    hijacked     the   meeting        entirely,      spending     several      minutes\n\ntalking about his suspension from UW. The Chancellor dismissed\n\nthe meeting and left, followed by the students. The meeting was\n\n       11\n       An unofficial transcript of the meeting was published by\nThe Forum, the student newspaper for UW-Marathon County. See\nJohn Kronenwetter, Transcript: UW Colleges Convocation, Student\nGovernance Council Meeting, Sept. 1, 2011 at UW-Fox Valley, The\nForum at UW-Marathon County, Nov. 1, 2011.\n\n                                              6\n\f                                                             No.   2011AP2902\n\n\n\nlater reconvened in another room without Decker, who had moved\n\non to a different meeting with the UW Colleges Assistant Deans\n\nfor Administrative Services, where he was removed by police.\n\n    ¶10     Decker's   next   recorded   trespass    onto     UW   property\n\noccurred on September 8, 2011, when Decker entered a meeting of\n\nthe Board of Regents held at Van Hise Hall, located on the UW\n\ncampus at Madison. Decker began to videotape and photograph the\n\nproceedings and was asked to leave by university police.12 Decker\n\ndeclined and continued to film the meeting. University police\n\ninformed Decker that he was in violation of his suspension and\n\nrepeated their request that Decker leave the meeting. Decker\n\nagain refused, and campus police arrested him, at which point\n\nDecker went limp and was dragged out of the meeting. Decker was\n\ncharged     with   criminal   Trespass   to   Land   under     Wis.   Stat.\n\n§ 943.13(1m)(a),13 but charges were ultimately dismissed on April\n\n23, 2012.\n\n\n\n    12\n       Decker later posted his footage of the September 8, 2011,\nmeeting on the internet. See UW Corruption, (Feb. 14, 2012),\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6VfXogJSEQ&feature=c4overview&li\nst=UUI5M8zovksT35zw07ScBdsw.   The   video  also   shows   Decker\napproaching UW-Oshkosh Chancellor Richard Wells with his\nvideocamera as Wells was getting into his car. Decker asked\nWells to speak with him and Wells declined. Decker exclaimed,\n\"If you happen to know exactly why you say I'm not stable enough\nfor a university environment, please do tell me.\" Decker\ncontinued to videotape Wells as he drove away.\n    13\n       Wisconsin Stat. § 943.13(1m)(a) prohibits entry onto \"any\nenclosed, cultivated or undeveloped land of another . . .\nwithout the express or implied consent of the owner or\noccupant.\"\n\n                                    7\n\f                                                                    No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶11     Decker's fourth documented trespass onto UW property\n\noccurred on September 19, 2011, when he entered a meeting of the\n\nUW-Fox    Valley     Board   of    Trustees      held   on   the    UW-Fox    Valley\n\ncampus. Decker began to speak at the meeting, but Interim Dean\n\nKeogh     reminded    Decker      he    was     prohibited   from    entering     UW\n\nproperty during his suspension and asked Decker to leave. Decker\n\nrefused and began handing out literature to meeting attendees as\n\nhe remarked:\n\n    I, myself, was personally assaulted by the chancellor\n    of the UW-Stevens Point and [the] UW system saw fit to\n    railroad and suspend me, all to protect hundreds of\n    millions of dollars of corruption and the end of rule\n    of law at the University of Wisconsin. . . . I'm not\n    going to leave this meeting. You know, I'll just sit\n    here until the cops haul me out.\nBy this time, the police had indeed been called. Decker again\n\nwent limp and continued to denounce university fees as he was\n\ndragged    from    the   room.14       Decker   was   charged   with      Disorderly\n\nConduct under Wis. Stat. § 947.01,15 and he pled no contest on\n\nJanuary 9, 2012.\n\n\n    14\n       According to The Fox Journal, the UW-Fox Valley student\nnewspaper, Decker returned to campus later that afternoon and\ndistributed literature in the office of Senior Student Affairs\nCoordinator Jeff Kuepper. See Kari Toland, Police arrest former\nUW-Stevens Point student at Fox, The Fox Journal, Oct. 17, 2011.\nThe article also explained that Decker had been protesting\nstudent fees at UW for five years at the time of his September\n19 arrest. Id.\n    15\n          Wisconsin Stat. § 947.01(1) provides:\n\n    Whoever, in a public or private place, engages in\n    violent,   abusive, indecent, profane,  boisterous,\n    unreasonably loud or otherwise disorderly conduct\n    under circumstances in which the conduct tends to\n                                           8\n\f                                                                          No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\n      ¶12     The UW Board of Regents petitioned the Dane County\n\nCircuit Court, Judge John Markson presiding, for a temporary\n\nrestraining     order    against      Decker    on     October      17,     2011.        The\n\npetition      named    the   University        of     Wisconsin       System      as     the\n\nprotected party. It requested Decker be required to (1) cease or\n\navoid harassing the protected party; (2) avoid the protected\n\nparty's residence and/or any premises it temporarily occupies;\n\n(3) avoid contact that harasses or intimidates the protected\n\nparty; and (4) refrain from entering upon any real property\n\nowned by, leased by, or otherwise subject to the control of the\n\nBoard of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System. The\n\ntemporary      restraining      order    was        granted    and     an       injunction\n\nhearing was scheduled for October 24, 2011.\n\n      ¶13     UW-Oshkosh     Police     Chief       Joseph    LeMire      attempted       to\n\nserve   the    temporary      restraining       order        papers    on       Decker    on\n\nOctober 18, 2011. Decker was on his porch when the Chief arrived\n\nat his house, but when the Chief got out of his car, Decker went\n\ninside, closed the door, and refused to answer the doorbell. The\nChief left and drove around the block, but when he returned,\n\nDecker's car was gone. A handgun hotline report later informed\n\nthe   Chief    that,    after    Decker       had     left    his     house,      he     had\n\nimmediately attempted to purchase a handgun.\n\n\n\n\n      cause or provoke a disturbance is guilty of a Class B\n      misdemeanor.\n\n                                          9\n\f                                                                        No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶14     On October 24, 2011, Judge Markson held an injunction\n\nhearing to discuss the Board of Regents' petition.                        The circuit\n\ncourt found that Decker attended meetings at UW,\n\n    knowing that he would be asked to leave, knowing that\n    he was not intending to leave, and then necessarily\n    what that would entail, which would be calling the\n    officers and causing the sort of disturbance that was\n    present on each of the occasions that were the subject\n    of testimony.\nThe circuit court concluded that Decker's repeated entry onto UW\n\nproperty    in    willful     violation     of   his       suspension    \"constitutes\n\nconduct of a sort that is harassing and intimidating\" and was\n\n\"not done for any lawful or legitimate purpose.\" The circuit\n\ncourt also found \"clear and convincing evidence that there is a\n\nreal concern that Mr. Decker may use a firearm to cause physical\n\nharm to another or endanger the public safety.\" The circuit\n\ncourt     reasoned    that     the    persistence          of   Decker's       harassing\n\nbehavior, his resistance to law enforcement, and his purchase of\n\na handgun immediately after Chief LeMire attempted to serve him\n\nwith the restraining order were sufficient to order a firearm\n\nrestriction for the pendency of the harassment injunction. The\n\ncircuit court noted Decker already possessed four other guns and\n\nremarked, \"It has not been satisfactorily explained to me the\n\nreason for his needing to buy yet another handgun and doing so\n\nimmediately after being aware that process is being served on\n\nhim in this case.\"\n\n    ¶15     The     circuit    court       granted     a    harassment        injunction\n\nagainst    Decker    based     on    the   Board     of     Regents'    petition     and\npursuant to Wis. Stat. § 813.125, effective through October 24,\n\n                                           10\n\f                                                                                 No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\n2015. The harassment injunction named the \"Board of Regents UW\n\nSystem,\" as the protected party, although the Board of Regents'\n\npetition requested protection for the \"University of Wisconsin\n\nSystem.\"         Decker was ordered to cease or avoid harassment of\n\nthe \"Board of Regents UW System,\" avoid the residence and any\n\npremises      temporarily      occupied          by    the     Board       of    Regents,       and\n\nrefrain from contacting the Board of Regents. Decker was also\n\nprohibited      from    possessing          a        firearm       until    the        harassment\n\ninjunction expired.\n\n       ¶16    In an unpublished, per curiam decision, the court of\n\nappeals      reversed    the    circuit         court's        order     for     a     harassment\n\ninjunction.      Board     of     Regents             v.    Decker,        No.       2011AP2902,\n\nunpublished slip op. (Wis. Ct. App. Jan. 24, 2013). The court of\n\nappeals reasoned that the harassment injunction statute, Wis.\n\nStat. § 813.125, requires a party seeking an injunction to prove\n\n\"(1) that the defendant intentionally engaged in a course of\n\nconduct which harassed the victim; and (2) that the defendant's\n\nconduct served no legitimate purpose.\" Id., ¶7. The court of\nappeals      assumed,     without       deciding,              that      Decker's         conduct\n\nconstituted      harassment,          but        it        determined       Decker        had     a\n\nlegitimate purpose for his actions. Id., ¶10. The court found\n\nthat   Decker's     purpose      in    attending             the    UW     meetings       was    to\n\nprotest university student fees, which was conduct he had been\n\nengaging in since at least 2010. Id., ¶12. The court of appeals\n\nnoted that Decker's right \"to publicly demonstrate, protest and\n\npersuade others\" is constitutionally protected. Id., ¶13. Since\n\"legitimate protest of government policies is protected by law,\"\n                                                11\n\f                                                                              No.       2011AP2902\n\n\n\nthe court of appeals concluded Decker had a legitimate purpose,\n\nand the harassment injunction was therefore improperly granted\n\nby the circuit court. Id.\n\n       ¶17   The Board of Regents petitioned this court for review,\n\nwhich we granted on June 14, 2013. We now reverse and remand to\n\nthe circuit court for the reasons discussed below.\n\n                                    II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       ¶18   This      case    requires         us    to     examine     the        harassment\n\ninjunction statute, Wis. Stat. § 813.125, to determine if the\n\nstatute applies to conduct against institutions in addition to\n\nnatural persons. Statutory interpretation is a question of law\n\nthat this court reviews de novo. State v. Alexander, 2013 WI 70,\n\n¶18, 349 Wis. 2d 327, 833 N.W.2d 126; Crown Castle USA, Inc. v.\n\nOrion Constr.

Ziolkowski, 2008 WI App 67, ¶23, 312 Wis. 2d 435, 752\nN.W.2d 359.       We   look     for       reasons     to     sustain     a    discretionary\n\nruling. Id., ¶24. In addition, \"[t]he scope of an injunction is\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court.\" Id.\n\n       ¶20   Though the decision to issue an injunction is within\n\nthe    discretion      of     the    circuit        court,    in   order       to       grant   an\n\ninjunction under Wis. Stat. § 813.125, the circuit court must\n\nfind   \"reasonable       grounds          to   believe     that    the       respondent         has\n\nengaged in harassment with intent to harass or intimidate the\npetitioner.\"        Wis.      Stat.        § 813.125(4)(a)3.           Such         a    finding\n                                               12\n\f                                                                        No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\npresents a mixed question of fact and law. Welytok, 312 Wis. 2d\n\n435, ¶23. This court will uphold the factual findings of the\n\ncircuit court unless they are clearly erroneous. Id. However,\n\nwhether reasonable grounds exist to grant the injunction is a\n\nquestion of law that we review de novo. Id.\n\n                                       III. DISCUSSION\n\n       ¶21   The    question       before    us    is   whether        the    harassment\n\ninjunction against Decker was properly granted by the circuit\n\ncourt    under     Wis.    Stat.    § 813.125,      the   harassment          injunction\n\nstatute.     The    Board    of    Regents       argues   Wis.     Stat.       § 813.125\n\nprotects institutions as well as people. The Board of Regents\n\nfurther      claims    Decker's        conduct    constituted          harassment      and\n\nlacked a legitimate purpose because his intent was to harass the\n\nboard and his actions were illegal as a matter of law. Decker\n\nresponds that Wis. Stat. § 813.125 does not provide authority to\n\nissue a harassment injunction to protect an institution. Decker\n\nalso    maintains     he    had    a   legitimate       purpose    to        protest   the\n\nBoard's activities, and therefore his conduct did not constitute\nharassment as defined by Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b). Decker's\n\nfinal argument is that the circuit court's harassment injunction\n\nis overbroad and vague in its scope.\n\n       ¶22   We begin in Part A by addressing whether Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125 applies to institutions as well as people. In Part B,\n\nwe discuss whether Decker's conduct constituted harassment and\n\nlacked       a     legitimate       purpose       pursuant        to      Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 813.125(1)(b). Finally, in Part C, we discuss the scope of the\nharassment injunction. For the reasons discussed below, we find\n                                            13\n\f                                                                       No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nthat Wis. Stat. § 813.125 applies to institutions, and Decker's\n\nconduct     constituted       harassment       that     was   properly       enjoined.\n\nHowever, because the parties agree the injunction was overbroad,\n\nwe   remand     to    the     circuit     court   to     refine   the        harassment\n\ninjunction and clarify its terms.\n\n           A.     Wisconsin Stat. § 813.125 Protects Institutions\n\n     ¶23    Wisconsin's harassment injunction statute, Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125, provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n     (1) Definition. In this section, \"harassment\" means\n     any of the following:\n\n     (a) Striking, shoving, kicking or otherwise subjecting\n     another person to physical contact; engaging in an act\n     that would constitute abuse under s. 48.02(1), sexual\n     assault under s. 940.225, or stalking under s. 940.32;\n     or attempting or threatening to do the same.\n\n     (b) Engaging in a course of conduct or repeatedly\n     committing acts which harass or intimidate another\n     person and which serve no legitimate purpose.\n     ¶24    The      Board    of   Regents     contends   Wis.    Stat.       § 813.125\n\nprotects institutions as well as individuals. For support, the\n\nBoard of Regents relies on Wis. Stat. § 990.01, which contains\n\nthe general definitions and rules of construction for Wisconsin\n\nlaws.   Wisconsin Stat. § 990.01 provides:\n\n     In the construction of Wisconsin laws the words and\n     phrases which follow shall be construed as indicated\n     unless such construction would produce a result\n     inconsistent  with   the  manifest  intent  of   the\n     legislature.\nWisconsin     Stat.    §     990.01(26)    goes    on    to   define    \"person\"     as\n\nincluding \"all partnerships, associations and bodies politic or\ncorporate.\" The Board of Regents argues that it is a political\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                                                                  No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nbody, and under Wis. Stat. § 36.07(1), it is also a corporate\n\nbody: \"The board and their successors in office shall constitute\n\na   body    corporate         by   the    name       of    'Board       of    Regents      of    the\n\nUniversity        of    Wisconsin       System.'\"         The    Board       of    Regents      also\n\nnotes      that    in        Village     of     Tigerton          v.     Minniecheske,           211\n\nWis. 2d 777,           565   N.W.2d 586         (Ct.      App.    1997),          the    court     of\n\nappeals held that Wis. Stat. § 813.125 can protect a municipal\n\ncorporation.\n\n      ¶25    Decker          argues      Wis.     Stat.         § 813.125(1)(a)            clearly\n\ncontemplates harassment directed towards an individual and not\n\ninstitutions. An institution such as the Board of Regents cannot\n\nbe the target of \"[s]triking, shoving, kicking or . . . physical\n\ncontact,\" nor can it be subjected to physical or sexual abuse,\n\nsexual      assault,         or    stalking.         Although          Decker's         harassment\n\ninjunction was issued under Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b), Decker\n\nmaintains the language of this subsection also suggests a human\n\nsubject. Relying on dictionary definitions of \"harass,\" Decker\n\nargues an institution cannot be \"subjected to mental agitation,\nworry, grief, anxiety, distress, or fear.\"\n\n      ¶26    We agree with the Board of Regents' argument that Wis.\n\nStat.      § 813.125         protects      institutions            as    well       as    people.\n\nAlthough     Wis.       Stat.      § 813.125(1)(b)              describes         harassment      as\n\n\"committing       acts       which     harass    or       intimidate         another      person,\"\n\nWisconsin's general definitions statute defines a \"person\" as\n\nincluding \"all partnerships, associations and bodies politic or\n\ncorporate.\"        Wis.       Stat.      § 990.01(26)           (emphasis         added).        This\ndefinition is presumed applicable to the harassment injunction\n                                                15\n\f                                                                             No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\nstatute      \"unless      such     construction               would    produce      a    result\n\ninconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature.\" Wis.\n\nStat. § 990.01. In Tigerton, the court of appeals noted, \"the\n\nlegislature's         definition     of       'person'         predates    the     harassment\n\nstatute.\" Tigerton, 211 Wis. 2d at 784. The court of appeals in\n\nTigerton relied on the \"maxim that assumes the lawmakers acted\n\nwith full knowledge of existing laws, including statutes\" and\n\nconcluded       the      legislature          intended          the    general      statutory\n\ndefinition       of     \"person\"    to     govern         the     harassment       injunction\n\nstatute. Id. Likewise, we assume the legislature was aware of\n\nthe statutory definition of \"person\" when it enacted Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125 and intended that definition to apply.                                   Nothing in\n\nWis. Stat. § 813.125 indicates such a reading would be contrary\n\nto    the    \"manifest     intent\"       of       the    legislature.       Moreover,       our\n\nconclusion is supported by the court of appeals' decision in\n\nTigerton,       which    held     that     Wis.         Stat.    §    813.125    applies    to\n\nmunicipal corporations.            Id. at 783.\n\n       ¶27    Having     determined        that         the    statutory    definition       of\n\"person\" in Wis. Stat. § 990.01(26) applies to the harassment\n\ninjunction statute, we must next consider whether the Board of\n\nRegents qualifies as a \"person\" under this definition. Wisconsin\n\nStat.       § 990.01(26)        defines       a      \"person\"         as   including       \"all\n\npartnerships,         associations       and       bodies       politic    or    corporate.\"\n\nThere is ample reason to think the Board of Regents constitutes\n\na    body    politic.     The    Board     of     Regents       is    empowered     to    enact\n\npolicies and promulgate rules; employ police officers to enforce\nits    rules;    appoint        officers      and       delegate      authority     to    those\n                                                16\n\f                                                                            No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nofficers;          allocate       funds     and         set    institutional        budgets;\n\nestablish a mission statement; and purchase, lease, and manage\n\nproperty.

Stat. § 813.125(1)(a),\n\nwhen read in isolation, does appear to contemplate harassment\n\ndirected towards a natural person. However, a party seeking a\n\nharassment injunction must establish the requirements of either\n\nWis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(a) or (1)(b). The harassment injunction\n\nagainst Decker was issued under Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b), and\n\nnothing   in    the      language      of    that       provision    invites      the    same\n\nconclusion.         It    is     an     established           canon       of      statutory\n\ninterpretation that \"statutory language is interpreted in the\n\ncontext in which it is used; not in isolation but as part of a\n\nwhole; in relation to the language of surrounding or closely-\n\nrelated     statutes;          and     reasonably,           to     avoid      absurd        or\n\nunreasonable results.\" State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Court for\n\nDane Cnty., 2004 WI 58, ¶46, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 681 N.W.2d 110.\n\n    ¶30     Decker claims an institution cannot be \"harassed\" or\n\n\"intimidated,\" as described in Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b), but\n\nthe very fact that the Board of Regents sought a harassment\n\ninjunction     against        Decker    indicates         otherwise.      After    all,       an\ninstitution is nothing more than a collection of individuals\n\nengaged   in    a    common     purpose.      An        institution,    as     well     as   an\n\nindividual,     can      be    the   subject       of     threats   and      intimidation,\n\nwhich is why protests and picket rallies are often organized\n\noutside of an institution's headquarters. Protestors frequently\n\ntarget institutions in an attempt to elicit a response and draw\n\nattention      to    themselves        and     their       cause.    Likewise,        Decker\n\nobviously sought to influence the Board of Regents through a\ncalculated,         long-term        scheme        of     protesting,        handing         out\n                                              18\n\f                                                                                No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nliterature, filming university board members and officials, and\n\ndisrupting university events. Decker might as easily be arguing\n\nthat an institution cannot be \"influenced\" or \"persuaded,\" but\n\nthis is clearly not what he believes. Decker's actions are a\n\nmanifestation of his belief that an institution can be harassed\n\nor intimidated in the same way that it can be influenced or\n\npersuaded.\n\n    ¶31       Our    conclusion         that       institutions          are    eligible      for\n\ninjunctive      protection            under    Wis.     Stat.          § 813.125       is    also\n\nsupported by public policy concerns. An injunction has several\n\nfeatures      that     make      it    an     especially          desirable         remedy    for\n\nharassment victims. First, an injunction can be quickly obtained\n\nwhen circumstances demand an immediate remedy. Second, a victim\n\ncan proactively seek protection by taking the initiative to seek\n\nan injunction. Third, injunctive relief does not depend on the\n\ncriminal justice system, which can take months or even years to\n\nrender a final judgment. Other hindrances such as understaffed\n\nprosecutor's offices, limited judicial resources, and the higher\nburden of proof required by the criminal justice system may,\n\nseparately     or    in    the     aggregate,         serve       to    deny    a     harassment\n\nvictim any protection.\n\n    ¶32       Decker      argues       the    Board    of     Regents          does    not   need\n\naccess   to    injunctive         relief       because       it    already       possesses      a\n\nsufficient      remedy        under         Wis.     Stat.        § 947.01,         Wisconsin's\n\ncriminal      disorderly         conduct           statute.        The     American          Civil\n\nLiberties Union (\"ACLU\") took a similar position in its amicus\nbrief.   The    ACLU      also     asserted         during    oral       arguments       that   a\n                                               19\n\f                                                                                   No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\nharassment victim's first recourse should always be to pursue\n\ncriminal charges. We conclude that such a requirement would lead\n\nto    absurd       results.          As    discussed       above,      many      features       of   a\n\nharassment injunction make it a superior remedy for victims.\n\nHarassment          injunctions             protect       a      variety      of       individuals,\n\nincluding those faced with serious and imminent threats to their\n\nsafety,      such       as     domestic         violence      victims.      In     2012,    circuit\n\ncourts       in    Wisconsin          handled       6,824        petitions       for     harassment\n\ninjunctions         and        temporary        restraining        orders.16       Thousands         of\n\nindividuals would be adversely affected if this court agreed\n\nwith the ACLU's position that criminal charges must be pursued\n\nbefore a harassment injunction can be issued.\n\n       ¶33        Moreover, both Decker and the ACLU fail to note that\n\nthe    Board       of     Regents         did    pursue         criminal    relief       prior       to\n\nobtaining the harassment injunction. In fact, Decker's history\n\nwith the Board of Regents demonstrates precisely why a criminal\n\nremedy      is     sometimes         inadequate.          Decker      was   arrested       multiple\n\ntimes       by    university         police,        and    as    Decker     explained       to   the\ncircuit          judge,        the    university          was     unable      to    successfully\n\nprosecute him prior to issuance of the harassment injunction.\n\nAlthough Decker was arrested on September 8, 2011, and charged\n\nwith    Trespass          to    Land       under    Wis.      Stat.    § 943.13(1m)(a),           the\n\nprosecutor         ultimately             dropped    the        charges.    Decker        was    also\n\n\n       16\n       Civil Disposition Summary—Statewide Report, Wisconsin\nCourt                                                     System,\nhttps://www.wicourts.gov/publications/statistics/circuit/docs/ci\nvildispostate12.pdf.\n\n                                                    20\n\f                                                                    No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\narrested again on September 19, 2011, but he was not convicted\n\nof Disorderly Conduct under Wis. Stat. § 947.01 until some two\n\nand a half months after the circuit court had already granted\n\nthe harassment injunction.\n\n    ¶34       In      addition,         university     officials           have      a\n\nresponsibility to ensure the health and safety of students. See,\n\ne.g., Wis. Stat. § 36.11(1)(a), (2)(b) (providing authority for\n\nthe Board of Regents to enact laws \"to protect the lives, health\n\nand safety of persons on property under its jurisdiction\" and to\n\nemploy    police   officers       to    \"preserve    the   peace\"    and     enforce\n\nuniversity rules). It cannot be disputed that threats to student\n\nsafety are on the rise. No institution, including a university,\n\nshould be forced to rely on the criminal justice system when a\n\nmore immediate remedy is available. A harassment injunction may\n\nnot prevent a tragedy such as the atrocious shooting at Virginia\n\nTech or Sandy Hook,17 but it is nevertheless an important and\n\neffective tool for university officials to maintain order and\n\nensure student health and safety.\n         B.    Decker's Conduct Constituted Harassment and Lacked a\n\n                               Legitimate Purpose\n\n    ¶35       We next address whether Decker's conduct constituted\n\nharassment     that    could   be      properly   enjoined   under        Wis.   Stat.\n\n\n    17\n       For background information on the shootings at Virginia\nTech, see Christine Hauser & Anahad O'Connor, Virginia Tech\nShooting Leaves 33 Dead, N.Y. Times, Apr. 16, 2007.

A circuit court may grant a harassment injunction if\n\nthere are \"reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent has\n\nengaged in harassment with intent to harass or intimidate the\n\npetitioner.\" Wis. Stat. § 813.125(4)(a)3. Harassment is defined\n\nas \"[e]ngaging in a course of conduct or repeatedly committing\n\nacts which harass or intimidate another person and which serve\n\nno legitimate purpose.\" Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b).\n\n       ¶36   The Board of Regents argues that Decker's persistent\n\ndisruptions      at   university    meetings      demonstrate       an     intent   to\n\nharass. The Board of Regents also contends that because Decker\n\nwas prohibited from entering UW property during his suspension,\n\nDecker's conduct was illegal as a matter of law and could not\n\nserve a legitimate purpose. The Board of Regents acknowledges\n\nthat    Decker    was   protesting       student     fees     but    asserts      that\n\notherwise    harassing    behavior       cannot    be   transformed        into   non-\n\nharassing, legitimate conduct simply by labeling it \"protest.\"\n\n       ¶37   Decker     argues     his     conduct      did      not       constitute\n\nharassment because he had the legitimate purpose of protesting\nstudent fees. Decker points out that harassment under Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125(1)(b) is conduct that serves \"no legitimate purpose.\"\n\nTherefore,    Decker    contends,    his      conduct    could      not    constitute\n\nharassment if he was motivated by any legitimate purpose. Decker\n\nmaintains his history of protesting UW's segregated student fees\n\ndemonstrates he was not motivated by a desire to harass.\n\n       ¶38   We agree with the circuit court that Decker's conduct\n\nconstituted harassment and lacked a legitimate purpose, and that\nDecker possessed the requisite intent to harass. In Bachowski v.\n                                         22\n\f                                                                             No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nSalamone, we explained, \"conduct or repetitive acts that are\n\nintended    to    harass    or       intimidate         do    not    serve    a    legitimate\n\npurpose.\"    Bachowski          v.    Salamone,         139     Wis. 2d 397,        408,   407\n\nN.W.2d 533 (1987). Decker argues conduct can never constitute\n\nharassment if it is done for any legitimate purpose, such as\n\nprotesting.      Taken     to    its       logical       conclusion,         this    argument\n\nsuggests that if an individual has both a legitimate and an\n\nillegitimate      purpose,           the    legitimate          purpose       automatically\n\nprotects    the    individual's            conduct       from       being    enjoined.     Put\n\nanother way, according to Decker's logic, conduct done with both\n\nthe purpose of protesting and the purpose of harassing cannot\n\nconstitute harassment. This is a senseless argument that flatly\n\ncontradicts       our    holding           in        Bachowski       that     intentionally\n\nharassing conduct can never serve a legitimate purpose. Decker\n\ncannot shield his harassing conduct from regulation by labeling\n\nit \"protest.\" If Decker's purpose was even in part to harass the\n\nBoard of Regents, his conduct may be enjoined under Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125.\n    ¶39     The circuit court described the evidence presented at\n\nthe injunction hearing regarding Decker's repeated entry onto UW\n\nproperty as follows:\n\n    . . . We did have corroborating evidence that people\n    have complained about that and found Decker's presence\n    at meetings, knowing he would be asked to leave,\n    knowing that he was not intending to leave, and then\n    necessarily what that would entail, which would be\n    calling   the  officers   and  causing   the  sort  of\n    disturbance that was present on each of the occasions\n    that were the subject of testimony here . . . .\n\n\n                                                23\n\f                                                                           No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n     I credit the testimony of the witnesses that were\n     offered by the university here. I think it was\n     credible, and I think it establishes a pattern, and a\n     pattern that if not enjoined, I am confident that\n     based on Mr. Decker's testimony today, he will intend\n     to repeat. And it constitutes harassment. It's not\n     done for any lawful or legitimate purpose.\nThe circuit court found that Decker had repeatedly trespassed on\n\nUW property with the intent to disrupt university proceedings.\n\nWe uphold the circuit court's findings of fact unless they are\n\nclearly erroneous. Welytok, 312 Wis. 2d 435, ¶23. Based on the\n\nevidence presented at the injunction hearing, the circuit court\n\nconcluded       that     Decker's       conduct      constituted          harassment       and\n\nlacked     a    legitimate        purpose.         The     circuit       court,     in    its\n\ndiscretion, decided to grant the harassment injunction against\n\nDecker. We give deference to a circuit court's decision to issue\n\na   harassment         injunction,      upholding         it     absent     an     erroneous\n\nexercise of discretion. Id. Based on the record, we conclude\n\nthat there was ample evidence to support the circuit court's\n\nfactual    findings        and    its    decision         to    grant     the     harassment\n\ninjunction against Decker.\n\n     ¶40       The     evidence     presented        before        the    circuit        court\n\ndemonstrated         the    following:         first,          Decker     swore     at    and\n\nthreatened the UWSP Chancellor in a meeting and stabbed the\n\nChancellor's         documents    with    a    pen       during    a    heated    argument.\n\nSecond, Decker told the suspension committee that he had no\n\nintention of complying with his suspension, and Decker was aware\n\nhis suspension prohibited him from entering UW property. Third,\n\nDecker trespassed on UW property on numerous occasions after his\nsuspension and disrupted several university meetings. Fourth,\n\n                                              24\n\f                                                                       No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nDecker attempted to purchase a handgun immediately after police\n\nendeavored to serve him with a restraining order.\n\n       ¶41    Specifically, the evidence at the injunction hearing\n\nestablished     that       on   September     1,     2011,   Decker    interrupted     a\n\nmeeting between student government members and the UW Colleges\n\nand UW-Extension Chancellor. University police arrested Decker,\n\nbut prior to their arrival Decker was so disruptive that the\n\nChancellor was forced to end the meeting. On September 8, 2011,\n\nDecker returned to UW property and disrupted another meeting.\n\nWhen Decker was again arrested, he went limp and police had to\n\ndrag Decker from the meeting. Not to be dissuaded from causing\n\nfurther disruption, Decker again trespassed on UW property on\n\nSeptember 19, 2011, and upset yet another meeting. University\n\nofficials repeatedly asked Decker to be quiet, but he refused.\n\nOnce again, Decker was arrested and forcibly dragged from the\n\nmeeting as he continued his diatribe against student fees. All\n\nof these events were delineated at Decker's injunction hearing,\n\nproviding      the       circuit    court     with    overwhelming       evidence      to\nconclude that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and lacked\n\na legitimate purpose. Based on Decker's pattern of knowingly\n\ntrespassing         on    university       property    to    interrupt       university\n\nmeetings, and his blatant disregard for the rights of university\n\nofficials and students, the circuit court could also reasonably\n\nfind   that    Decker       engaged    in    harassment      with     the    intent   to\n\nharass.\n\n       ¶42    The    circuit       court    also     concluded   that       Decker    may\npresent a threat to public safety.

For\n\ninstance, Decker left a note in the Chancellor's office that he\n\nspecifically       designated     a    \"threat.\"     Decker   also    sent    several\n\nintimidating emails to the Chancellor. The circuit court could\n\nreasonably conclude that Decker's conduct was unpredictable at\n\nbest and dangerous at worst. The risk to public safety, combined\n\nwith        Decker's   pattern    of       trespassing      and   his      deliberate\n\ndisruption of university meetings, provides abundant support for\n\nthe circuit court's decision to issue the harassment injunction.\n\n       ¶43     We recognize that Decker's protests implicate First\n\nAmendment concerns.19 \"With respect to persons entitled to be\n       18\n       Decker also argues in his brief that the harassment\ninjunction's firearm restriction was not supported by clear and\nconvincing evidence and violated his Second Amendment right to\nbear arms. We disagree and conclude that the circuit court\ncorrectly determined that Decker's outburst during his meeting\nwith Chancellor Patterson, his history of volatile behavior, and\nhis attempted purchase of a handgun after police tried to serve\nhim with a temporary restraining order supplied a sufficient\nbasis to find clear and convincing evidence existed to support\nthe firearm restriction.

Decker's      right     to     protest     on     UW     property      can     be\n\nrestricted when he engages in harassment with the intent to\n\nharass or intimidate. The circuit court's conclusion that Decker\n\nengaged in harassment with the intent to harass or intimidate\n\nthe Board of Regents was supported by an abundance of evidence,\n\nand we give deference to the circuit court's decision to issue\n\nthe harassment injunction.                We conclude that the circuit court's\n\ndecision to grant a harassment injunction was a proper exercise\n\nof its discretion.\n\n                  C.       The Scope of the Harassment Injunction\n\n       ¶46    Decker's       final     argument        is     that     the        harassment\n\ninjunction is vague and overbroad in its scope. Decker maintains\n\nthat    because      the     harassment         injunction         prohibits      him      from\n\ncontacting      any      university         representatives,           the        injunction\n\nproscribes     contact       with    all    40,000     university       employees          and,\n\narguably, all 181,000 university students. By its terms, Decker\n\nasserts that the injunction \"forbid[s] benign association with\none    25th     of     the     state        population.\"           Decker     claims       the\n\ninjunction's      reach      extends       to    members      of    Decker's       religious\n\ncongregation and his professional contacts. Decker also contends\n\nthe    injunction      infringes       on       his   First    Amendment          rights    by\n\nenjoining contact with thousands of people who were unaffected\n\nby the complained-of conduct.\n\n       ¶47    The Board of Regents did not address the scope of the\n\nharassment injunction in its brief, but it conceded at oral\nargument that the harassment injunction was overbroad.\n                                             29\n\f                                                                                  No.      2011AP2902\n\n\n\n       ¶48    Because the parties both concede that the injunction\n\nis overbroad, we need not address this issue.                            Rather, we remand\n\nto the circuit court to refine the injunction.22                                  In Bachowski,\n\nwe     explained     that,          because       the    violation       of       a       harassment\n\ninjunction      is       a    criminal       offense,         the    injunction            \"must    be\n\nspecific      as    to       the    acts     and       conduct       which    are         enjoined.\"\n\nBachowski,         139       Wis. 2d at       414.        Clarity       in        a       harassment\n\ninjunction is essential, not just for the parties involved, but\n\nalso in order for law enforcement to effectively enforce it.\n\nSee, e.g., State v. Sveum, 2002 WI App 105, ¶24, 254 Wis. 2d\n\n868,    648   N.W.2d         496    (\"Before       the    violation          of   a       harassment\n\ninjunction may be found, the State must prove at least that: (1)\n\nan injunction was issued against the defendant under Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125; and (2) the defendant committed an act that violated\n\nthe terms of the injunction.)\".\n\n       ¶49    The protected party named in the harassment injunction\n\nis the \"Board of Regents UW System.\" However, the petition for\n\nthe    injunction         requested         protection         for    the     \"University           of\nWisconsin      System\"         as    a     whole,       and   the     petitioner            for    the\n\nharassment     injunction            was    the     \"Board     of     Regents         –    Univ.    of\n\n\n       22\n       For instance, the circuit court ordered Decker to\n\"avoid[] the residence and any premises temporarily occupied by\nthe petitioner/protected person.\"   We note that the University\nof Wisconsin System may include entities such as the University\nof Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, UW-affiliated bookstores and\ntheaters, and the University of Wisconsin Foundation, an\nindependent charitable institution.   By refining the harassment\ninjunction, the circuit court can clarify whether it intended\nsuch an expansive reach.\n\n                                                  30\n\f                                                              No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nWisconsin System.\" In addition, the circuit court explained at\n\nthe   injunction      hearing     that    Decker     was   restrained       from\n\ncontacting \"the UW or any of its representatives.\" Consequently,\n\nit may be unclear to both Decker and law enforcement who the\n\nprotected party is.23\n\n      ¶50   We are not equipped with sufficient facts to undertake\n\nthe task of refining the harassment injunction.               In this case,\n\nthe   circuit    court   found    that    Decker's     conduct     constituted\n\nharassment24    and   made   a   discretionary     decision   to    grant    the\n\ninjunction. The circuit court is therefore better situated to\n\nassess the facts and apply its discretion to craft an injunction\n\ntailored to the particularized facts of each case.\n      23\n        We do not suggest that a harassment injunction that\nprotects an institution can never proscribe contact with\nspecific individuals. An institution can be defined in many\ndifferent ways, from its organizational structure or real estate\nholdings to its list of members, employees, or representatives.\nThe larger the institution, the greater the difficulty in\ndefining the scope of the protection afforded by the injunction.\nThese issues do not arise in the context of a typical harassment\ninjunction protecting an individual, such as a domestic violence\nvictim.   Therefore, the scope of an injunction protecting an\ninstitution may need to be structured with greater care than an\nordinary injunction protecting an individual. Obviously, nothing\nin this opinion limits the authority of a circuit court to craft\nan appropriate injunction to protect an individual.\n      24\n       We acknowledge that Decker's suspension was set to expire\non January 1, 2012. There is nothing in the record to indicate\nwhether Decker's suspension actually expired, whether it was\nextended, or whether Decker has since been suspended again for\nother reasons. In the time this case has taken to come before\nus, the terms of Decker's suspension might very well have\nchanged, and we decline to speculate on its current status. The\nparties are free to request an amendment to the injunction from\nthe circuit court if they have additional particularized needs\nor concerns that pertain to facts not before us.\n\n                                     31\n\f                                                                             No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶51      We conclude the circuit court properly determined that\n\na harassment injunction can be granted to protect the Board of\n\nRegents from Decker's harassing behavior, and it provided ample\n\nsupport for its reasoning on a difficult issue that implicated\n\nboth First Amendment and public safety concerns. However, we\n\nremand to the circuit court to refine the injunction and clarify\n\nits terms.\n\n                                      IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n    ¶52      We     hold     that     Wis.       Stat.      § 813.125          can     extend\n\ninjunctive        protection    to     institutions             as    well     as     natural\n\npersons. We further hold that the circuit court's decision to\n\ngrant   a   harassment       injunction       was     a    proper      exercise       of     its\n\ndiscretion, and sufficient evidence existed for the court to\n\nfind that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and lacked a\n\nlegitimate        purpose.   However,        because        the      parties       agree     the\n\ninjunction was overbroad, we remand to the circuit court to\n\nfurther clarify the scope of the injunction. For these reasons,\n\nthe decision of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause\nis remanded to the circuit court.\n\n    By      the    Court.—The       decision     of       the   court    of        appeals    is\n\nreversed, and the cause is remanded to the circuit court for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    ¶53      ANN WALSH BRADLEY, J., did not participate.\n\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\f                                                                       2011AP2902.ssa\n\n\n     ¶54    SHIRLEY S.

Everyone\n\ninvolved in the instant case——including the Board of Regents,1\n\nDecker,     and    this     court2——agrees       that     the     circuit   court's\n\nharassment injunction does not pass muster:                     the scope of the\n\ninjunction    is        impermissibly     broad.         The    majority    opinion\n\ncorrectly asserts that the circuit court's harassment injunction\n\nfails to identify the protected party and fails to specify the\n\nconduct to be enjoined.3\n     ¶55    Because the injunction is overbroad, the injunction is\n\ninvalid.4         On    remand,     the   circuit   court       must    refine    the\n\ninjunction and clarify its terms.

Although I agree with the\n\nmajority opinion that our case law has interpreted the statute\n\nto permit harassment injunctions to protect \"persons\" (defined\n\nmore broadly than \"individuals\" in Wis.

Salamone, 139 Wis. 2d 397, 414-15, 407\n\nN.W.2d 533     (1987),   the   lead      case    interpreting   Wis.   Stat.\n\n§ 813.125, the harassment statute.              If an injunction fails to\n\nmeet the criteria in Bachowski, the injunction is \"invalid.\"14\n     ¶61     According to the Bachowski case, 139 Wis. 2d at 414-\n\n15, upon which the majority openly relies, the proceedings and\n\nharassment injunction must meet the following requirements:\n\n     I.      The petitioner being protected by the injunction must\n\n             be specific and named;15\n\n     II.     The   harassing   conduct    that    is   the   basis   for   the\n\n             injunction must be set forth;16\n     14\n          Bachowski, 139 Wis. 2d at 414.\n     15\n       Wis. Stat. § 813.125(5)(a)1.-2.

The Bachowski court stated:     \"Thus, it would be\ninsufficient, for example, pursuant to sec. 813.125(5)(a) for a\npetitioner to simply allege that he or she has been 'harassed or\nintimidated' by the [defendant].\"     Bachowski, 139 Wis. 2d at\n412-13.\n                                5\n\f                                                              2011AP2902.ssa\n\n\n    III. The specific harassing acts or conduct to be enjoined\n\n          must be either identical to or substantially similar\n\n          to the conduct found to be harassing by the circuit\n\n          court;17 and\n\n    IV.   An injunction must be \"specific as to the acts and\n\n          conduct which are enjoined\" such that the defendant\n\n          has   notice   of   what   he   or   she   is   prohibited   from\n\n          doing.18\n                                     I\n\n    ¶62   To assist the circuit court, I begin with the first\n\nBachowski criterion:      the petitioner and the party protected\n\nmust be specific and named.\n\n    ¶63   In the instant case, a real issue exists about who the\n\npetitioner is and who the protected party is.             They need not be\n\nthe same person.\n\n    17\n       \"Only the acts or conduct which are proven at trial and\nform the basis of the judge's finding of harassment or\nsubstantially similar conduct should be enjoined.\"  Bachowski,\n139 Wis. 2d at 414.\n\n     See also III Wisconsin Judicial Benchbook, Family Actions,\nMiscellaneous Actions, Harassment FA 18-54 (4th ed. 2011)\n(similarly   stating  the  injunction  \"must  be   tailored  to\nnecessities of particular case\").

In its oral ruling, the circuit court stated\n\nthat    Decker   was   \"specifically       prohibited   from   contacting   or\n\ncausing any person to contact              the UW or its representatives\n\nunless they consent in writing\" (emphasis added).               I agree with\n\nthe majority opinion that it is \"unclear to both Decker and law\n\nenforcement who the protected party is.\"19\n\n       ¶65   The circuit court's injunction appears to include as\nprotected parties between 18 individuals (the individual members\n\nof the Board of Regents) and 200,000 or more individuals (the\n\nstudents, staff, and faculty of the university).\n\n       ¶66   The lack of clarity of the protected party's identity\n\nin the circuit court's injunction renders it invalid under the\n\nfirst Bachowski criterion:      the protected party is undefined and\n\nunknown.     The identity of the protected party must be clear from\n\nthe injunction.\n\n                                   II\n\n       ¶67   The second Bachowski criterion is that the harassing\n\nconduct that is the basis for the injunction must be set forth.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n       See   majority op.,  ¶49  (listing                various  potential\nformulations of the protected party from                the record in the\ninstant case).\n\n     The majority opinion lists other parties that may be\n\"protected parties\" under the circuit court's injunction.\nMajority op., ¶48 n.22.\n\n                                       7\n\f                                                                           2011AP2902.ssa\n\n\n      ¶68   Trespass is the gravamen of the harassing conduct used\n\nto   justify    the     injunction.        Trespass     in    turn        is    based    on\n\nDecker's status as a suspended student.20\n\n      ¶69   The     circuit     court   described      the    trespasses          as    the\n\nharassing conduct, as follows:\n\n      [T]here are several incidents described as a matter of\n      the record here that Mr. Decker, contrary to the clear\n      terms   of   the   lawful  existing   order    that  is\n      established . . . .

Decker was prohibited from\n\nentering     \"the       University       of    Wisconsin        system,      all     of    its\n\ncampuses,        any    premises       under    the       control    of     the    Board    of\n\nRegents.\"\n     ¶83     The        Board     of    Regents       controls       18,000       acres      of\n\nproperty,        with    campuses       across      25      counties.        The     UW    has\n\napproximately 1,814 buildings covering 60 million square feet of\n\nspace.27     UW property extends from UW medical facilities across\n\nthe state, including doctor's offices and emergency rooms, to\n\nconservation tracts and nature preserves, to apartments, to golf\n\ncourses, and so on.\n\n     ¶84     How should Decker or law enforcement identify which\n\nproperties are \"controlled by\" the Board of Regents?\n\n           • The University of Wisconsin Hospital and its medical\n\n             facilities          are    run    by     a     separate       authority       that\n             includes members of the Board of Regents.

Under Bachowski, an injunction that fails to meet\nthe criteria is invalid.           Thus, the majority opinion in effect\n\nvacates the injunction and advises the circuit court to start\n                                        13\n\f                                                                   2011AP2902.ssa\n\n\nover.       Circumstances   may    have        changed    significantly   since\n\nOctober 24, 2011, when the injunction was issued.\n\n      ¶88    Before I conclude, let me quickly note the issues that\n\nI do not address.\n\n      ¶89    I do not address whether the conduct at issue meets\n\nthe     statutory   definition     of        harassment    under   Wis.   Stat.\n\n§ 813.125(1)(b).28     \"Harassment\" is defined as repeated conduct\n\nthat harasses or intimidates another person \"and which serves no\nlegitimate     purpose.\"    Wis.    Stat.        § 813.125(1)(b)      (emphasis\n\nadded).      I do not address the statutory language \"serves no\n\nlegitimate purpose.\"29\n\n\n      28\n       The statutory definition of \"harassment\" is problematic;\n\"harassment\" is defined as \"acts which harass,\" a form of the\nvery word being defined.\n\n     To grant an injunction, the circuit court must find\nreasonable grounds to believe that the person has engaged in\nharassment with the intent to harass or intimidate a named party\nand   which  serves   no   legitimate  purpose.     Wis.   Stat.\n§ 813.125(4)(a)3.\n      29\n       The parties expend considerable effort addressing the\n\"legitimate purpose\" statutory language.  The majority opinion\ntakes language out of context from Bachowski, 139 Wis. 2d at\n408, treating the case as saying that \"intentionally harassing\nconduct can never serve a legitimate purpose.\"   Majority op.,\n¶38.\n\n     The majority opinion treats the statutory phrase \"which\nserves no legitimate purpose\" as surplusage, contravening our\nrules of statutory interpretation.   See Crown Castle USA, Inc.\nv. Orion Const. Grp., LLC, 2012 WI 29, ¶13, 339 Wis. 2d 252, 811\nN.W.2d 332.\n\n     Bachowski, 139      Wis. 2d at 408,           treats the inquiry into\nlegitimate purpose       as a separate             element of harassment,\ndeclaring:\n\n                                        14\n\f                                                            2011AP2902.ssa\n\n\n     ¶90    I do not address First Amendment issues, although I\n\nagree with the court of appeals that there are freedom of speech\n\nimplications presented by the instant case.30 Injunctions carry\n\ngreat     risks   of   freedom   of   speech   violations   and   deserve\n\nadditional scrutiny from courts.31\n\n\n     The definition of harassment further requires that the\n     harassing and intimidating acts \"serve no legitimate\n     purpose.\"   This is a recognition by the legislature\n     that conduct or repetitive acts that are intended to\n     harass or intimidate do not serve a legitimate\n     purpose.   Whether acts or conduct are done for the\n     purpose of harassing or intimidating, rather than for\n     a purpose that is protected or permitted by law, is a\n     determination that must of necessity be left to the\n     fact finder, taking into account all the facts and\n     circumstances.\n\n     The court of appeals opinion reads Bachowski as stating\nthat conduct can be harassment only if \"done for the purpose of\nharassing or intimidating, rather than for a purpose that is\nprotected or permitted by law.\"      Bd. of Regents-UW Sys. v.\nDecker, No. 2011AP2902, unpublished slip op., ¶11 (Wis.

App.\nJan. 24, 2013).\n\n     In Welytok, 312 Wis. 2d 435, ¶¶30-31, the court of appeals\nviewed the \"no legitimate purpose\" language as establishing a\nseparate element and concluded that the circuit court found that\nthe defendant was \"motivated by one thing and one thing only and\nthat was to harass,\" that the circuit court \"saw through\" the\ndefendant's \"attempts to manufacture a legitimate purpose,\" and\nthat the circuit court's finding that no legitimate purpose was\nintended was supported by the evidence.\n     30\n       A case should be decided on non-constitutional grounds\nwhenever possible.

PROSSER,      J.       (concurring).            The    majority\n\nopinion makes a powerful case for the issuance of a harassment\n\ninjunction against Jeffrey Decker (Decker).                          Decker's campaign\n\nregarding the use of student segregated fees in the University\n\nof Wisconsin System has been self-defeating because his tactics\n\nalienate     people        who   might       otherwise        share     his       concerns.\n\nWhatever Decker's message is, it is completely overshadowed by\n\nhis   tactics,        which      have     crossed        the     line        and     become\n\nunreasonable.        I concur in the majority opinion because I agree\n\nthat something had to be done.\n\n      ¶93   I   also       agree      with       the   majority       (and        with   the\n\nconcurrence     of    the     Chief     Justice)       that    the    circuit       court's\n\ninjunction is too broad and must be redone.                           If a remand for\n\nrevision were not part of the majority opinion, I would feel\n\nobligated to dissent.\n\n      ¶94   Having explained my reasons for concurrence, I must\n\nregister my reservations about the interpretation of Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125.\n\n      ¶95   In my view, this statute was never intended to cover\n\ninstitutions as well as natural persons.                        It was intended to\n\naddress a wide variety of harassment problems when people have\n\nto deal with the irrational conduct of other people.                              Thus, the\n\nremedies that must be afforded to an abused spouse, and may be\n\nafforded to a corporate officer or a member of the University of\n\nWisconsin Board of Regents as an individual, are not the same as\nthe remedies that may be afforded to everyone who is part of a\n\ncorporation or an educational institution.\n                                             1\n\f                                                                            No.    2011AP2902.dtp\n\n\n      ¶96    Once the court determines that the broad definition of\n\n\"person\"1 applies to an institution as a victim, then necessarily\n\nit   also   applies      to      an   institution       as    a    perpetrator.                I    am\n\nconfident        that        many      people        believe           some       institution,\n\nassociation,      or    body        politic    or    corporate         is     engaging         in    a\n\ncourse of conduct to harass or intimidate them in a manner that\n\nserves no legitimate purpose.\n\n      ¶97    The statute has been interpreted more broadly than I\n\nwould     read   it     in    Village     of       Tigerton       v.    Minniecheske,              211\n\nWis. 2d 777, 565 N.W.2d 586 (Ct. App. 1997), and now in this\n\ncase.     But the legislature has failed to give much guidance on\n\nhow judges should apply the statute in these cases.                                     This lack\n\nof guidance is bound to spawn future controversy.\n\n      ¶98    I respectfully suggest that the legislature review the\n\nlanguage and effectiveness of all the specialized statutes on\n\ninjunctions and restraining orders in Wis. Stat. ch. 813 and\n\nconsider     adopting        a   new    statute       for    \"persons\"            who    are       not\n\npeople.\n      ¶99    For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Wis.

This is a review of an\n\nunpublished     decision    of   the   court       of   appeals1      reversing       a\ndecision and order of the Dane County Circuit Court2 issuing a\n\nharassment     injunction    against    defendant         Jeffrey       S.     Decker\n\npursuant to Wis. Stat. § 813.125 (2009-10).3\n\n\n      1\n       Board of Regents v. Decker, No. 2011AP2902, unpublished\nslip op. (Wis. Ct. App. Jan. 24, 2013).\n      2\n          The Honorable John W. Markson presiding.\n      3\n       All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to\nthe 2009-10 version unless otherwise indicated.\n\f                                                                           No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶2      The question before us is whether the circuit court\n\nproperly     granted      a    harassment         injunction        under    Wis.        Stat.\n\n§ 813.125,    Wisconsin's        harassment            injunction     statute.       Decker\n\nargues that (1) Wis. Stat. § 813.125 does not extend protection\n\nto institutions; (2) his behavior did not constitute harassment\n\nunder the statute; and (3) the harassment injunction granted by\n\nthe circuit court was overbroad and vague. The Board of Regents\n\nconcedes4 that the injunction was overbroad but asserts that Wis.\n\nStat. § 813.125 protects institutions as well as people, and\n\nfurther argues that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and\n\nlacked a legitimate purpose.\n\n    ¶3      We     hold       that    Wis.        Stat.     § 813.125        can     extend\n\ninjunctive       protection      to    institutions          as     well     as     natural\n\npersons. We further hold that the circuit court's decision to\n\ngrant   a   harassment        injunction         was   a   proper    exercise       of    its\n\ndiscretion, and sufficient evidence existed for the court to\n\nfind that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and lacked a\n\nlegitimate    purpose.        However,       because       the    parties        agree    the\ninjunction was overbroad, we remand to the circuit court to\n\nrefine the injunction and clarify its terms. For these reasons,\n\nthe decision of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause\n\nis remanded to the circuit court.\n\n\n\n\n    4\n       This court is \"not bound by the parties' interpretation of\nthe law or obligated to accept a party's concession of law.\"\nState v.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n      ¶4      Jeffrey S. Decker (\"Decker\") is a former student of\n\nthe University of Wisconsin—Stevens Point (\"UWSP\"). On August\n\n13,   2010,    Decker     met   with   the   UWSP    Chancellor,     Dr.   Bernie\n\nPatterson,     in   the    Chancellor's      office      to   discuss    Decker's\n\nconcerns regarding segregated fees charged to students.5 During\n\nthe meeting, Decker became agitated and began to talk about\n\nuniversity employees in a derogatory manner. Decker also swore\n\nat    the   Chancellor      and   threatened        to   interfere      with   the\n\nChancellor's upcoming State of the University address and donor\n\nfunction if his demands were not met.6 As tensions escalated\n\nduring the meeting, Decker reached for a stack of papers on the\n\nChancellor's conference table. The Chancellor informed Decker\n\nthe papers did not belong to him and tried to pull the documents\n\naway, but Decker yanked the papers back and forcibly stabbed\n\n\n      5\n       Segregated fees are \"charges in addition to instructional\nfees assessed to all students for services, programs and\nfacilities that support the primary mission of the university.\"\nSegregated   Fees   Information,   Office   of   the   Registrar,\nhttp://registrar.wisc.edu/segregated_fees_information.htm   (last\nvisited Dec. 24, 2013). Decker believes that university\nofficials must consult student government prior to assessing\nsegregated fees.\n      6\n       Decker sent several emails to the Chancellor prior to\ntheir meeting. For instance, on August 4, 2010, Decker emailed\nthe Chancellor regarding segregated fees and stated, \"There is\nonly one answer to the question I pose, and unless you answer it\nby 9 am tomorrow I will embarrass you before your peers for\nbeing in charge of an utterly corrupt and despicable scheme.\" On\nAugust 5, 2010, Decker wrote, \"It'll be a few hours before you\ndiscover how I've chosen to embarrass you personally for your\nnew role in this scam. Just because I believe in fairness and\nopportunity, here's this second notice.\"\n\n                                        3\n\f                                                          No.   2011AP2902\n\n\n\nthem with a pen. The Chancellor then called the police to remove\n\nDecker from his office.7 The Chancellor returned to his office\n\napproximately thirty minutes later and found the following note:\n\n    Threat: Due to rampant violations of of [sic] state\n    law, ethical and professional standards and multiple\n    commitments for communication, I shall soon demand the\n    resignation of Kevin Reily [sic] and Bernie Patterson,\n    or a dragon shall do it for all students. Jef Decker\n    ¶5     As a result of Decker's behavior during his meeting\n\nwith the Chancellor, Decker was brought before a Nonacademic\nDisciplinary   Committee   (\"the   Committee\"),   which     found    that\n\nDecker had engaged in Disorderly Conduct in violation of Wis.\n\nAdmin. Code § 18.11(2).8 The Committee suspended Decker from UWSP\n\n\n    7\n       Decker provided a slightly different version of events in\na written statement he made to UWSP Police. Decker claims he\ninformed the Chancellor that he would demand the resignation of\nUW System President Kevin Reilly \"from within a giant dragon\ncostume.\" Decker maintains that the Chancellor reacted by\n\"visibly shaking with rage\" and vowing to document Decker's\nthreats. Decker alleges he then offered to write down his\nstatements for the Chancellor on a packet of papers in front of\nDecker. As Decker began to write, Vice Chancellor Bob Tomlinson,\nwho was also present at the meeting, attempted to remove\nDecker's pen from the papers. Decker resisted and applied more\npressure to the pen as the Chancellor seized the papers,\nresulting in the papers becoming crumpled.\n    8\n        Wisconsin Admin. Code § UWS 18.11(2) states:\n\n    No person may engage in violent, abusive, indecent,\n    profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud or otherwise\n    disorderly conduct under circumstances in which the\n    conduct tends to cause or provoke a disturbance, in\n    university buildings or on university lands.\n\nWisconsin Admin. Code § UWS 17.09(14) provides university\nofficials with disciplinary authority over students in\nviolation of Chapter 18.\n\n                                   4\n\f                                                                        No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nfor the period of November 19, 2010, through January 1, 2012. At\n\nthe   end    of   the     disciplinary         meeting,     Decker      informed     the\n\nCommittee     that   he    had     no    intention     of      complying      with   the\n\nsuspension.\n\n      ¶6     Decker was true to his word. University of Wisconsin\n\n(\"UW\")      regulations     provide       that     a      suspended       student     is\n\nprohibited from being \"present on any campus without the written\n\nconsent of the chief administrative officer of that campus.\"\n\nWis. Admin. Code § UWS 17.17(4).9 Nevertheless, Decker continued\n\nto enter university property on at least four separate occasions\n\nafter he was suspended, which are described in detail below.10\n\n      ¶7     On January 22, 2011, Decker requested permission from\n\nChancellor     Richard     Wells    of    UW-Oshkosh      to    enter    the    campus,\n\n\n      9\n       Decker later testified before the circuit court that\napproximately one week after his suspension, he \"became aware\nthat the university's position was that Administrative Code\n17.17 prohibited me from being on campus.\" Decker also stated,\n\"it's clear based on my actions after [the suspension], that I\ndo not regard the Administrative Code to be lawful in a free\ncountry where public property can be accessed by citizens of\nthis great land.\"\n      10\n       Although the Board of Regents chronicles only four\nincidents in which Decker entered UW property after his\nsuspension, Decker was charged with two additional violations of\nWis. Admin. Code § UWS 18.11(7)(a), which prohibits suspended\nstudents from entering university lands. The first charge\nstemmed from conduct occurring on February 15, 2011, in\nWinnebago County, and was dismissed on May 9, 2011. The second\ncharge related to conduct occurring on October 12, 2011, in\nWinnebago County, and Decker was convicted after a bench trial\non January 26, 2012. In addition, although only one of the\nincidents described by the Board of Regents occurred on the UW-\nOshkosh campus, Decker testified before the circuit court that\nhe had been at UW-Oshkosh \"several times\" since his suspension.\n\n                                           5\n\f                                                                        No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nwhich was denied. In spite of Wells' denial, Decker went to an\n\nintercollegiate basketball game at UW-Oshkosh and distributed\n\nliterature to attendees.\n\n       ¶8     On   September      1,    2011,     Decker     entered    UW-Fox    Valley\n\nproperty to attend a meeting between members of the UW student\n\ngovernment      and    Ray     Cross,       the   UW   Colleges   and       UW-Extension\n\nChancellor.11 Decker interrupted the meeting while the Chancellor\n\nwas    posing      a   question        to    student    government      members.       The\n\nChancellor      asked    Decker        to    leave,    but    Decker    continued       to\n\ndisrupt the meeting. The Chancellor then asked a colleague to\n\ncall    the   police     and    apologetically          explained      to    Decker:    \"I\n\nreally hate to do this. If you had remained quiet, Jeff, I\n\nwouldn’t have done that.\" Decker responded by admonishing the\n\nChancellor for not returning his phone calls, at which point the\n\nChancellor started to leave the meeting. A student then asked\n\nDecker to remain silent: \"Mr. Decker, this is our time to visit\n\nwith the Chancellor. . . . I think it would be respectful if we\n\ncould spend our time with him. We don’t get a whole lot of\ntime.\"\n\n       ¶9     Decker promised to be quiet, then after a brief pause,\n\nhe    hijacked     the   meeting        entirely,      spending     several      minutes\n\ntalking about his suspension from UW. The Chancellor dismissed\n\nthe meeting and left, followed by the students. The meeting was\n\n       11\n       An unofficial transcript of the meeting was published by\nThe Forum, the student newspaper for UW-Marathon County. See\nJohn Kronenwetter, Transcript: UW Colleges Convocation, Student\nGovernance Council Meeting, Sept. 1, 2011 at UW-Fox Valley, The\nForum at UW-Marathon County, Nov. 1, 2011.\n\n                                              6\n\f                                                             No.   2011AP2902\n\n\n\nlater reconvened in another room without Decker, who had moved\n\non to a different meeting with the UW Colleges Assistant Deans\n\nfor Administrative Services, where he was removed by police.\n\n    ¶10     Decker's   next   recorded   trespass    onto     UW   property\n\noccurred on September 8, 2011, when Decker entered a meeting of\n\nthe Board of Regents held at Van Hise Hall, located on the UW\n\ncampus at Madison. Decker began to videotape and photograph the\n\nproceedings and was asked to leave by university police.12 Decker\n\ndeclined and continued to film the meeting. University police\n\ninformed Decker that he was in violation of his suspension and\n\nrepeated their request that Decker leave the meeting. Decker\n\nagain refused, and campus police arrested him, at which point\n\nDecker went limp and was dragged out of the meeting. Decker was\n\ncharged     with   criminal   Trespass   to   Land   under     Wis.   Stat.\n\n§ 943.13(1m)(a),13 but charges were ultimately dismissed on April\n\n23, 2012.\n\n\n\n    12\n       Decker later posted his footage of the September 8, 2011,\nmeeting on the internet. See UW Corruption, (Feb. 14, 2012),\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6VfXogJSEQ&feature=c4overview&li\nst=UUI5M8zovksT35zw07ScBdsw.   The   video  also   shows   Decker\napproaching UW-Oshkosh Chancellor Richard Wells with his\nvideocamera as Wells was getting into his car. Decker asked\nWells to speak with him and Wells declined. Decker exclaimed,\n\"If you happen to know exactly why you say I'm not stable enough\nfor a university environment, please do tell me.\" Decker\ncontinued to videotape Wells as he drove away.\n    13\n       Wisconsin Stat. § 943.13(1m)(a) prohibits entry onto \"any\nenclosed, cultivated or undeveloped land of another . . .\nwithout the express or implied consent of the owner or\noccupant.\"\n\n                                    7\n\f                                                                    No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶11     Decker's fourth documented trespass onto UW property\n\noccurred on September 19, 2011, when he entered a meeting of the\n\nUW-Fox    Valley     Board   of    Trustees      held   on   the    UW-Fox    Valley\n\ncampus. Decker began to speak at the meeting, but Interim Dean\n\nKeogh     reminded    Decker      he    was     prohibited   from    entering     UW\n\nproperty during his suspension and asked Decker to leave. Decker\n\nrefused and began handing out literature to meeting attendees as\n\nhe remarked:\n\n    I, myself, was personally assaulted by the chancellor\n    of the UW-Stevens Point and [the] UW system saw fit to\n    railroad and suspend me, all to protect hundreds of\n    millions of dollars of corruption and the end of rule\n    of law at the University of Wisconsin. . . . I'm not\n    going to leave this meeting. You know, I'll just sit\n    here until the cops haul me out.\nBy this time, the police had indeed been called. Decker again\n\nwent limp and continued to denounce university fees as he was\n\ndragged    from    the   room.14       Decker   was   charged   with      Disorderly\n\nConduct under Wis. Stat. § 947.01,15 and he pled no contest on\n\nJanuary 9, 2012.\n\n\n    14\n       According to The Fox Journal, the UW-Fox Valley student\nnewspaper, Decker returned to campus later that afternoon and\ndistributed literature in the office of Senior Student Affairs\nCoordinator Jeff Kuepper. See Kari Toland, Police arrest former\nUW-Stevens Point student at Fox, The Fox Journal, Oct. 17, 2011.\nThe article also explained that Decker had been protesting\nstudent fees at UW for five years at the time of his September\n19 arrest. Id.\n    15\n          Wisconsin Stat. § 947.01(1) provides:\n\n    Whoever, in a public or private place, engages in\n    violent,   abusive, indecent, profane,  boisterous,\n    unreasonably loud or otherwise disorderly conduct\n    under circumstances in which the conduct tends to\n                                           8\n\f                                                                          No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\n      ¶12     The UW Board of Regents petitioned the Dane County\n\nCircuit Court, Judge John Markson presiding, for a temporary\n\nrestraining     order    against      Decker    on     October      17,     2011.        The\n\npetition      named    the   University        of     Wisconsin       System      as     the\n\nprotected party. It requested Decker be required to (1) cease or\n\navoid harassing the protected party; (2) avoid the protected\n\nparty's residence and/or any premises it temporarily occupies;\n\n(3) avoid contact that harasses or intimidates the protected\n\nparty; and (4) refrain from entering upon any real property\n\nowned by, leased by, or otherwise subject to the control of the\n\nBoard of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System. The\n\ntemporary      restraining      order    was        granted    and     an       injunction\n\nhearing was scheduled for October 24, 2011.\n\n      ¶13     UW-Oshkosh     Police     Chief       Joseph    LeMire      attempted       to\n\nserve   the    temporary      restraining       order        papers    on       Decker    on\n\nOctober 18, 2011. Decker was on his porch when the Chief arrived\n\nat his house, but when the Chief got out of his car, Decker went\n\ninside, closed the door, and refused to answer the doorbell. The\nChief left and drove around the block, but when he returned,\n\nDecker's car was gone. A handgun hotline report later informed\n\nthe   Chief    that,    after    Decker       had     left    his     house,      he     had\n\nimmediately attempted to purchase a handgun.\n\n\n\n\n      cause or provoke a disturbance is guilty of a Class B\n      misdemeanor.\n\n                                          9\n\f                                                                        No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶14     On October 24, 2011, Judge Markson held an injunction\n\nhearing to discuss the Board of Regents' petition.                        The circuit\n\ncourt found that Decker attended meetings at UW,\n\n    knowing that he would be asked to leave, knowing that\n    he was not intending to leave, and then necessarily\n    what that would entail, which would be calling the\n    officers and causing the sort of disturbance that was\n    present on each of the occasions that were the subject\n    of testimony.\nThe circuit court concluded that Decker's repeated entry onto UW\n\nproperty    in    willful     violation     of   his       suspension    \"constitutes\n\nconduct of a sort that is harassing and intimidating\" and was\n\n\"not done for any lawful or legitimate purpose.\" The circuit\n\ncourt also found \"clear and convincing evidence that there is a\n\nreal concern that Mr. Decker may use a firearm to cause physical\n\nharm to another or endanger the public safety.\" The circuit\n\ncourt     reasoned    that     the    persistence          of   Decker's       harassing\n\nbehavior, his resistance to law enforcement, and his purchase of\n\na handgun immediately after Chief LeMire attempted to serve him\n\nwith the restraining order were sufficient to order a firearm\n\nrestriction for the pendency of the harassment injunction. The\n\ncircuit court noted Decker already possessed four other guns and\n\nremarked, \"It has not been satisfactorily explained to me the\n\nreason for his needing to buy yet another handgun and doing so\n\nimmediately after being aware that process is being served on\n\nhim in this case.\"\n\n    ¶15     The     circuit    court       granted     a    harassment        injunction\n\nagainst    Decker    based     on    the   Board     of     Regents'    petition     and\npursuant to Wis.

The harassment injunction named the \"Board of Regents UW\n\nSystem,\" as the protected party, although the Board of Regents'\n\npetition requested protection for the \"University of Wisconsin\n\nSystem.\"         Decker was ordered to cease or avoid harassment of\n\nthe \"Board of Regents UW System,\" avoid the residence and any\n\npremises      temporarily      occupied          by    the     Board       of    Regents,       and\n\nrefrain from contacting the Board of Regents. Decker was also\n\nprohibited      from    possessing          a        firearm       until    the        harassment\n\ninjunction expired.\n\n       ¶16    In an unpublished, per curiam decision, the court of\n\nappeals      reversed    the    circuit         court's        order     for     a     harassment\n\ninjunction.      Board     of     Regents             v.    Decker,        No.       2011AP2902,\n\nunpublished slip op. (Wis. Ct. App. Jan. 24, 2013). The court of\n\nappeals reasoned that the harassment injunction statute, Wis.\n\nStat. § 813.125, requires a party seeking an injunction to prove\n\n\"(1) that the defendant intentionally engaged in a course of\n\nconduct which harassed the victim; and (2) that the defendant's\n\nconduct served no legitimate purpose.\" Id., ¶7. The court of\nappeals      assumed,     without       deciding,              that      Decker's         conduct\n\nconstituted      harassment,          but        it        determined       Decker        had     a\n\nlegitimate purpose for his actions. Id., ¶10. The court found\n\nthat   Decker's     purpose      in    attending             the    UW     meetings       was    to\n\nprotest university student fees, which was conduct he had been\n\nengaging in since at least 2010. Id., ¶12. The court of appeals\n\nnoted that Decker's right \"to publicly demonstrate, protest and\n\npersuade others\" is constitutionally protected. Id., ¶13. Since\n\"legitimate protest of government policies is protected by law,\"\n                                                11\n\f                                                                              No.       2011AP2902\n\n\n\nthe court of appeals concluded Decker had a legitimate purpose,\n\nand the harassment injunction was therefore improperly granted\n\nby the circuit court. Id.\n\n       ¶17   The Board of Regents petitioned this court for review,\n\nwhich we granted on June 14, 2013. We now reverse and remand to\n\nthe circuit court for the reasons discussed below.\n\n                                    II.

DISCUSSION\n\n       ¶21   The    question       before    us    is   whether        the    harassment\n\ninjunction against Decker was properly granted by the circuit\n\ncourt    under     Wis.    Stat.    § 813.125,      the   harassment          injunction\n\nstatute.     The    Board    of    Regents       argues   Wis.     Stat.       § 813.125\n\nprotects institutions as well as people. The Board of Regents\n\nfurther      claims    Decker's        conduct    constituted          harassment      and\n\nlacked a legitimate purpose because his intent was to harass the\n\nboard and his actions were illegal as a matter of law. Decker\n\nresponds that Wis. Stat. § 813.125 does not provide authority to\n\nissue a harassment injunction to protect an institution. Decker\n\nalso    maintains     he    had    a   legitimate       purpose    to        protest   the\n\nBoard's activities, and therefore his conduct did not constitute\nharassment as defined by Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b). Decker's\n\nfinal argument is that the circuit court's harassment injunction\n\nis overbroad and vague in its scope.\n\n       ¶22   We begin in Part A by addressing whether Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125 applies to institutions as well as people. In Part B,\n\nwe discuss whether Decker's conduct constituted harassment and\n\nlacked       a     legitimate       purpose       pursuant        to      Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 813.125(1)(b). Finally, in Part C, we discuss the scope of the\nharassment injunction. For the reasons discussed below, we find\n                                            13\n\f                                                                       No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nthat Wis. Stat. § 813.125 applies to institutions, and Decker's\n\nconduct     constituted       harassment       that     was   properly       enjoined.\n\nHowever, because the parties agree the injunction was overbroad,\n\nwe   remand     to    the     circuit     court   to     refine   the        harassment\n\ninjunction and clarify its terms.\n\n           A.     Wisconsin Stat. § 813.125 Protects Institutions\n\n     ¶23    Wisconsin's harassment injunction statute, Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125, provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n     (1) Definition. In this section, \"harassment\" means\n     any of the following:\n\n     (a) Striking, shoving, kicking or otherwise subjecting\n     another person to physical contact; engaging in an act\n     that would constitute abuse under s. 48.02(1), sexual\n     assault under s. 940.225, or stalking under s. 940.32;\n     or attempting or threatening to do the same.\n\n     (b) Engaging in a course of conduct or repeatedly\n     committing acts which harass or intimidate another\n     person and which serve no legitimate purpose.\n     ¶24    The      Board    of   Regents     contends   Wis.    Stat.       § 813.125\n\nprotects institutions as well as individuals. For support, the\n\nBoard of Regents relies on Wis. Stat. § 990.01, which contains\n\nthe general definitions and rules of construction for Wisconsin\n\nlaws.   Wisconsin Stat. § 990.01 provides:\n\n     In the construction of Wisconsin laws the words and\n     phrases which follow shall be construed as indicated\n     unless such construction would produce a result\n     inconsistent  with   the  manifest  intent  of   the\n     legislature.\nWisconsin     Stat.    §     990.01(26)    goes    on    to   define    \"person\"     as\n\nincluding \"all partnerships, associations and bodies politic or\ncorporate.\" The Board of Regents argues that it is a political\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                                                                  No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nbody, and under Wis. Stat. § 36.07(1), it is also a corporate\n\nbody: \"The board and their successors in office shall constitute\n\na   body    corporate         by   the    name       of    'Board       of    Regents      of    the\n\nUniversity        of    Wisconsin       System.'\"         The    Board       of    Regents      also\n\nnotes      that    in        Village     of     Tigerton          v.

App.    1997),          the    court     of\n\nappeals held that Wis. Stat. § 813.125 can protect a municipal\n\ncorporation.\n\n      ¶25    Decker          argues      Wis.     Stat.         § 813.125(1)(a)            clearly\n\ncontemplates harassment directed towards an individual and not\n\ninstitutions. An institution such as the Board of Regents cannot\n\nbe the target of \"[s]triking, shoving, kicking or . . . physical\n\ncontact,\" nor can it be subjected to physical or sexual abuse,\n\nsexual      assault,         or    stalking.         Although          Decker's         harassment\n\ninjunction was issued under Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b), Decker\n\nmaintains the language of this subsection also suggests a human\n\nsubject. Relying on dictionary definitions of \"harass,\" Decker\n\nargues an institution cannot be \"subjected to mental agitation,\nworry, grief, anxiety, distress, or fear.\"\n\n      ¶26    We agree with the Board of Regents' argument that Wis.\n\nStat.      § 813.125         protects      institutions            as    well       as    people.\n\nAlthough     Wis.       Stat.      § 813.125(1)(b)              describes         harassment      as\n\n\"committing       acts       which     harass    or       intimidate         another      person,\"\n\nWisconsin's general definitions statute defines a \"person\" as\n\nincluding \"all partnerships, associations and bodies politic or\n\ncorporate.\"        Wis.       Stat.      § 990.01(26)           (emphasis         added).        This\ndefinition is presumed applicable to the harassment injunction\n                                                15\n\f                                                                             No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\nstatute      \"unless      such     construction               would    produce      a    result\n\ninconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature.\" Wis.\n\nStat. § 990.01. In Tigerton, the court of appeals noted, \"the\n\nlegislature's         definition     of       'person'         predates    the     harassment\n\nstatute.\" Tigerton, 211 Wis. 2d at 784. The court of appeals in\n\nTigerton relied on the \"maxim that assumes the lawmakers acted\n\nwith full knowledge of existing laws, including statutes\" and\n\nconcluded       the      legislature          intended          the    general      statutory\n\ndefinition       of     \"person\"    to     govern         the     harassment       injunction\n\nstatute. Id. Likewise, we assume the legislature was aware of\n\nthe statutory definition of \"person\" when it enacted Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125 and intended that definition to apply.                                   Nothing in\n\nWis. Stat. § 813.125 indicates such a reading would be contrary\n\nto    the    \"manifest     intent\"       of       the    legislature.       Moreover,       our\n\nconclusion is supported by the court of appeals' decision in\n\nTigerton,       which    held     that     Wis.         Stat.    §    813.125    applies    to\n\nmunicipal corporations.            Id. at 783.\n\n       ¶27    Having     determined        that         the    statutory    definition       of\n\"person\" in Wis. Stat. § 990.01(26) applies to the harassment\n\ninjunction statute, we must next consider whether the Board of\n\nRegents qualifies as a \"person\" under this definition. Wisconsin\n\nStat.       § 990.01(26)        defines       a      \"person\"         as   including       \"all\n\npartnerships,         associations       and       bodies       politic    or    corporate.\"\n\nThere is ample reason to think the Board of Regents constitutes\n\na    body    politic.     The    Board     of     Regents       is    empowered     to    enact\n\npolicies and promulgate rules; employ police officers to enforce\nits    rules;    appoint        officers      and       delegate      authority     to    those\n                                                16\n\f                                                                            No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nofficers;          allocate       funds     and         set    institutional        budgets;\n\nestablish a mission statement; and purchase, lease, and manage\n\nproperty.

However, a party seeking a\n\nharassment injunction must establish the requirements of either\n\nWis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(a) or (1)(b). The harassment injunction\n\nagainst Decker was issued under Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b), and\n\nnothing   in    the      language      of    that       provision    invites      the    same\n\nconclusion.

Stat. § 813.125(1)(b), but\n\nthe very fact that the Board of Regents sought a harassment\n\ninjunction     against        Decker    indicates         otherwise.      After    all,       an\ninstitution is nothing more than a collection of individuals\n\nengaged   in    a    common     purpose.      An        institution,    as     well     as   an\n\nindividual,     can      be    the   subject       of     threats   and      intimidation,\n\nwhich is why protests and picket rallies are often organized\n\noutside of an institution's headquarters. Protestors frequently\n\ntarget institutions in an attempt to elicit a response and draw\n\nattention      to    themselves        and     their       cause.    Likewise,        Decker\n\nobviously sought to influence the Board of Regents through a\ncalculated,         long-term        scheme        of     protesting,        handing         out\n                                              18\n\f                                                                                No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nliterature, filming university board members and officials, and\n\ndisrupting university events. Decker might as easily be arguing\n\nthat an institution cannot be \"influenced\" or \"persuaded,\" but\n\nthis is clearly not what he believes. Decker's actions are a\n\nmanifestation of his belief that an institution can be harassed\n\nor intimidated in the same way that it can be influenced or\n\npersuaded.\n\n    ¶31       Our    conclusion         that       institutions          are    eligible      for\n\ninjunctive      protection            under    Wis.     Stat.          § 813.125       is    also\n\nsupported by public policy concerns. An injunction has several\n\nfeatures      that     make      it    an     especially          desirable         remedy    for\n\nharassment victims. First, an injunction can be quickly obtained\n\nwhen circumstances demand an immediate remedy. Second, a victim\n\ncan proactively seek protection by taking the initiative to seek\n\nan injunction. Third, injunctive relief does not depend on the\n\ncriminal justice system, which can take months or even years to\n\nrender a final judgment. Other hindrances such as understaffed\n\nprosecutor's offices, limited judicial resources, and the higher\nburden of proof required by the criminal justice system may,\n\nseparately     or    in    the     aggregate,         serve       to    deny    a     harassment\n\nvictim any protection.\n\n    ¶32       Decker      argues       the    Board    of     Regents          does    not   need\n\naccess   to    injunctive         relief       because       it    already       possesses      a\n\nsufficient      remedy        under         Wis.     Stat.        § 947.01,         Wisconsin's\n\ncriminal      disorderly         conduct           statute.        The     American          Civil\n\nLiberties Union (\"ACLU\") took a similar position in its amicus\nbrief.   The    ACLU      also     asserted         during    oral       arguments       that   a\n                                               19\n\f                                                                                   No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\nharassment victim's first recourse should always be to pursue\n\ncriminal charges. We conclude that such a requirement would lead\n\nto    absurd       results.          As    discussed       above,      many      features       of   a\n\nharassment injunction make it a superior remedy for victims.\n\nHarassment          injunctions             protect       a      variety      of       individuals,\n\nincluding those faced with serious and imminent threats to their\n\nsafety,      such       as     domestic         violence      victims.      In     2012,    circuit\n\ncourts       in    Wisconsin          handled       6,824        petitions       for     harassment\n\ninjunctions         and        temporary        restraining        orders.16       Thousands         of\n\nindividuals would be adversely affected if this court agreed\n\nwith the ACLU's position that criminal charges must be pursued\n\nbefore a harassment injunction can be issued.\n\n       ¶33        Moreover, both Decker and the ACLU fail to note that\n\nthe    Board       of     Regents         did    pursue         criminal    relief       prior       to\n\nobtaining the harassment injunction. In fact, Decker's history\n\nwith the Board of Regents demonstrates precisely why a criminal\n\nremedy      is     sometimes         inadequate.          Decker      was   arrested       multiple\n\ntimes       by    university         police,        and    as    Decker     explained       to   the\ncircuit          judge,        the    university          was     unable      to    successfully\n\nprosecute him prior to issuance of the harassment injunction.\n\nAlthough Decker was arrested on September 8, 2011, and charged\n\nwith    Trespass          to    Land       under    Wis.      Stat.    § 943.13(1m)(a),           the\n\nprosecutor         ultimately             dropped    the        charges.    Decker        was    also\n\n\n       16\n       Civil Disposition Summary—Statewide Report, Wisconsin\nCourt                                                     System,\nhttps://www.wicourts.gov/publications/statistics/circuit/docs/ci\nvildispostate12.pdf.\n\n                                                    20\n\f                                                                    No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\narrested again on September 19, 2011, but he was not convicted\n\nof Disorderly Conduct under Wis. Stat. § 947.01 until some two\n\nand a half months after the circuit court had already granted\n\nthe harassment injunction.\n\n    ¶34       In      addition,         university     officials           have      a\n\nresponsibility to ensure the health and safety of students. See,\n\ne.g., Wis. Stat. § 36.11(1)(a), (2)(b) (providing authority for\n\nthe Board of Regents to enact laws \"to protect the lives, health\n\nand safety of persons on property under its jurisdiction\" and to\n\nemploy    police   officers       to    \"preserve    the   peace\"    and     enforce\n\nuniversity rules). It cannot be disputed that threats to student\n\nsafety are on the rise. No institution, including a university,\n\nshould be forced to rely on the criminal justice system when a\n\nmore immediate remedy is available. A harassment injunction may\n\nnot prevent a tragedy such as the atrocious shooting at Virginia\n\nTech or Sandy Hook,17 but it is nevertheless an important and\n\neffective tool for university officials to maintain order and\n\nensure student health and safety.\n         B.    Decker's Conduct Constituted Harassment and Lacked a\n\n                               Legitimate Purpose\n\n    ¶35       We next address whether Decker's conduct constituted\n\nharassment     that    could   be      properly   enjoined   under        Wis.   Stat.\n\n\n    17\n       For background information on the shootings at Virginia\nTech, see Christine Hauser & Anahad O'Connor, Virginia Tech\nShooting Leaves 33 Dead, N.Y. Times, Apr. 16, 2007.

A circuit court may grant a harassment injunction if\n\nthere are \"reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent has\n\nengaged in harassment with intent to harass or intimidate the\n\npetitioner.\" Wis. Stat. § 813.125(4)(a)3. Harassment is defined\n\nas \"[e]ngaging in a course of conduct or repeatedly committing\n\nacts which harass or intimidate another person and which serve\n\nno legitimate purpose.\" Wis. Stat. § 813.125(1)(b).\n\n       ¶36   The Board of Regents argues that Decker's persistent\n\ndisruptions      at   university    meetings      demonstrate       an     intent   to\n\nharass. The Board of Regents also contends that because Decker\n\nwas prohibited from entering UW property during his suspension,\n\nDecker's conduct was illegal as a matter of law and could not\n\nserve a legitimate purpose. The Board of Regents acknowledges\n\nthat    Decker    was   protesting       student     fees     but    asserts      that\n\notherwise    harassing    behavior       cannot    be   transformed        into   non-\n\nharassing, legitimate conduct simply by labeling it \"protest.\"\n\n       ¶37   Decker     argues     his     conduct      did      not       constitute\n\nharassment because he had the legitimate purpose of protesting\nstudent fees. Decker points out that harassment under Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125(1)(b) is conduct that serves \"no legitimate purpose.\"\n\nTherefore,    Decker    contends,    his      conduct    could      not    constitute\n\nharassment if he was motivated by any legitimate purpose. Decker\n\nmaintains his history of protesting UW's segregated student fees\n\ndemonstrates he was not motivated by a desire to harass.\n\n       ¶38   We agree with the circuit court that Decker's conduct\n\nconstituted harassment and lacked a legitimate purpose, and that\nDecker possessed the requisite intent to harass. In Bachowski v.\n                                         22\n\f                                                                             No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nSalamone, we explained, \"conduct or repetitive acts that are\n\nintended    to    harass    or       intimidate         do    not    serve    a    legitimate\n\npurpose.\"    Bachowski          v.

Decker argues conduct can never constitute\n\nharassment if it is done for any legitimate purpose, such as\n\nprotesting.      Taken     to    its       logical       conclusion,         this    argument\n\nsuggests that if an individual has both a legitimate and an\n\nillegitimate      purpose,           the    legitimate          purpose       automatically\n\nprotects    the    individual's            conduct       from       being    enjoined.     Put\n\nanother way, according to Decker's logic, conduct done with both\n\nthe purpose of protesting and the purpose of harassing cannot\n\nconstitute harassment. This is a senseless argument that flatly\n\ncontradicts       our    holding           in        Bachowski       that     intentionally\n\nharassing conduct can never serve a legitimate purpose. Decker\n\ncannot shield his harassing conduct from regulation by labeling\n\nit \"protest.\" If Decker's purpose was even in part to harass the\n\nBoard of Regents, his conduct may be enjoined under Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125.\n    ¶39     The circuit court described the evidence presented at\n\nthe injunction hearing regarding Decker's repeated entry onto UW\n\nproperty as follows:\n\n    . . . We did have corroborating evidence that people\n    have complained about that and found Decker's presence\n    at meetings, knowing he would be asked to leave,\n    knowing that he was not intending to leave, and then\n    necessarily what that would entail, which would be\n    calling   the  officers   and  causing   the  sort  of\n    disturbance that was present on each of the occasions\n    that were the subject of testimony here . . . .\n\n\n                                                23\n\f                                                                           No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n     I credit the testimony of the witnesses that were\n     offered by the university here. I think it was\n     credible, and I think it establishes a pattern, and a\n     pattern that if not enjoined, I am confident that\n     based on Mr. Decker's testimony today, he will intend\n     to repeat. And it constitutes harassment. It's not\n     done for any lawful or legitimate purpose.\nThe circuit court found that Decker had repeatedly trespassed on\n\nUW property with the intent to disrupt university proceedings.\n\nWe uphold the circuit court's findings of fact unless they are\n\nclearly erroneous.

Based on the\n\nevidence presented at the injunction hearing, the circuit court\n\nconcluded       that     Decker's       conduct      constituted          harassment       and\n\nlacked     a    legitimate        purpose.         The     circuit       court,     in    its\n\ndiscretion, decided to grant the harassment injunction against\n\nDecker. We give deference to a circuit court's decision to issue\n\na   harassment         injunction,      upholding         it     absent     an     erroneous\n\nexercise of discretion. Id. Based on the record, we conclude\n\nthat there was ample evidence to support the circuit court's\n\nfactual    findings        and    its    decision         to    grant     the     harassment\n\ninjunction against Decker.\n\n     ¶40       The     evidence     presented        before        the    circuit        court\n\ndemonstrated         the    following:         first,          Decker     swore     at    and\n\nthreatened the UWSP Chancellor in a meeting and stabbed the\n\nChancellor's         documents    with    a    pen       during    a    heated    argument.\n\nSecond, Decker told the suspension committee that he had no\n\nintention of complying with his suspension, and Decker was aware\n\nhis suspension prohibited him from entering UW property. Third,\n\nDecker trespassed on UW property on numerous occasions after his\nsuspension and disrupted several university meetings. Fourth,\n\n                                              24\n\f                                                                       No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nDecker attempted to purchase a handgun immediately after police\n\nendeavored to serve him with a restraining order.\n\n       ¶41    Specifically, the evidence at the injunction hearing\n\nestablished     that       on   September     1,     2011,   Decker    interrupted     a\n\nmeeting between student government members and the UW Colleges\n\nand UW-Extension Chancellor. University police arrested Decker,\n\nbut prior to their arrival Decker was so disruptive that the\n\nChancellor was forced to end the meeting. On September 8, 2011,\n\nDecker returned to UW property and disrupted another meeting.\n\nWhen Decker was again arrested, he went limp and police had to\n\ndrag Decker from the meeting. Not to be dissuaded from causing\n\nfurther disruption, Decker again trespassed on UW property on\n\nSeptember 19, 2011, and upset yet another meeting. University\n\nofficials repeatedly asked Decker to be quiet, but he refused.\n\nOnce again, Decker was arrested and forcibly dragged from the\n\nmeeting as he continued his diatribe against student fees. All\n\nof these events were delineated at Decker's injunction hearing,\n\nproviding      the       circuit    court     with    overwhelming       evidence      to\nconclude that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and lacked\n\na legitimate purpose. Based on Decker's pattern of knowingly\n\ntrespassing         on    university       property    to    interrupt       university\n\nmeetings, and his blatant disregard for the rights of university\n\nofficials and students, the circuit court could also reasonably\n\nfind   that    Decker       engaged    in    harassment      with     the    intent   to\n\nharass.\n\n       ¶42    The    circuit       court    also     concluded   that       Decker    may\npresent a threat to public safety. Decker's attempted purchase\n                                             25\n\f                                                                     No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\nof a handgun immediately after police visited his home led the\n\ncircuit court to find there was \"clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat there is a real concern that Mr. Decker may use a firearm\n\nto   cause      physical   harm       to   another    or   endanger     the    public\n\nsafety.\"18 The circuit court's public safety concern is bolstered\n\nby   Decker's      prior   exchanges        with   the     UWSP   Chancellor.      For\n\ninstance, Decker left a note in the Chancellor's office that he\n\nspecifically       designated     a    \"threat.\"     Decker   also    sent    several\n\nintimidating emails to the Chancellor. The circuit court could\n\nreasonably conclude that Decker's conduct was unpredictable at\n\nbest and dangerous at worst. The risk to public safety, combined\n\nwith        Decker's   pattern    of       trespassing      and   his      deliberate\n\ndisruption of university meetings, provides abundant support for\n\nthe circuit court's decision to issue the harassment injunction.\n\n       ¶43     We recognize that Decker's protests implicate First\n\nAmendment concerns.19 \"With respect to persons entitled to be\n       18\n       Decker also argues in his brief that the harassment\ninjunction's firearm restriction was not supported by clear and\nconvincing evidence and violated his Second Amendment right to\nbear arms. We disagree and conclude that the circuit court\ncorrectly determined that Decker's outburst during his meeting\nwith Chancellor Patterson, his history of volatile behavior, and\nhis attempted purchase of a handgun after police tried to serve\nhim with a temporary restraining order supplied a sufficient\nbasis to find clear and convincing evidence existed to support\nthe firearm restriction. We defer to the circuit court's\nfindings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.

Decker's      right     to     protest     on     UW     property      can     be\n\nrestricted when he engages in harassment with the intent to\n\nharass or intimidate. The circuit court's conclusion that Decker\n\nengaged in harassment with the intent to harass or intimidate\n\nthe Board of Regents was supported by an abundance of evidence,\n\nand we give deference to the circuit court's decision to issue\n\nthe harassment injunction.                We conclude that the circuit court's\n\ndecision to grant a harassment injunction was a proper exercise\n\nof its discretion.\n\n                  C.       The Scope of the Harassment Injunction\n\n       ¶46    Decker's       final     argument        is     that     the        harassment\n\ninjunction is vague and overbroad in its scope. Decker maintains\n\nthat    because      the     harassment         injunction         prohibits      him      from\n\ncontacting      any      university         representatives,           the        injunction\n\nproscribes     contact       with    all    40,000     university       employees          and,\n\narguably, all 181,000 university students. By its terms, Decker\n\nasserts that the injunction \"forbid[s] benign association with\none    25th     of     the     state        population.\"           Decker     claims       the\n\ninjunction's      reach      extends       to    members      of    Decker's       religious\n\ncongregation and his professional contacts. Decker also contends\n\nthe    injunction      infringes       on       his   First    Amendment          rights    by\n\nenjoining contact with thousands of people who were unaffected\n\nby the complained-of conduct.\n\n       ¶47    The Board of Regents did not address the scope of the\n\nharassment injunction in its brief, but it conceded at oral\nargument that the harassment injunction was overbroad.\n                                             29\n\f                                                                                  No.      2011AP2902\n\n\n\n       ¶48    Because the parties both concede that the injunction\n\nis overbroad, we need not address this issue.                            Rather, we remand\n\nto the circuit court to refine the injunction.22                                  In Bachowski,\n\nwe     explained     that,          because       the    violation       of       a       harassment\n\ninjunction      is       a    criminal       offense,         the    injunction            \"must    be\n\nspecific      as    to       the    acts     and       conduct       which    are         enjoined.\"\n\nBachowski,         139       Wis. 2d at       414.        Clarity       in        a       harassment\n\ninjunction is essential, not just for the parties involved, but\n\nalso in order for law enforcement to effectively enforce it.\n\nSee, e.g., State v.

By refining the harassment\ninjunction, the circuit court can clarify whether it intended\nsuch an expansive reach.\n\n                                                  30\n\f                                                              No.    2011AP2902\n\n\n\nWisconsin System.\" In addition, the circuit court explained at\n\nthe   injunction      hearing     that    Decker     was   restrained       from\n\ncontacting \"the UW or any of its representatives.\" Consequently,\n\nit may be unclear to both Decker and law enforcement who the\n\nprotected party is.23\n\n      ¶50   We are not equipped with sufficient facts to undertake\n\nthe task of refining the harassment injunction.               In this case,\n\nthe   circuit    court   found    that    Decker's     conduct     constituted\n\nharassment24    and   made   a   discretionary     decision   to    grant    the\n\ninjunction. The circuit court is therefore better situated to\n\nassess the facts and apply its discretion to craft an injunction\n\ntailored to the particularized facts of each case.\n      23\n        We do not suggest that a harassment injunction that\nprotects an institution can never proscribe contact with\nspecific individuals. An institution can be defined in many\ndifferent ways, from its organizational structure or real estate\nholdings to its list of members, employees, or representatives.\nThe larger the institution, the greater the difficulty in\ndefining the scope of the protection afforded by the injunction.\nThese issues do not arise in the context of a typical harassment\ninjunction protecting an individual, such as a domestic violence\nvictim.   Therefore, the scope of an injunction protecting an\ninstitution may need to be structured with greater care than an\nordinary injunction protecting an individual. Obviously, nothing\nin this opinion limits the authority of a circuit court to craft\nan appropriate injunction to protect an individual.\n      24\n       We acknowledge that Decker's suspension was set to expire\non January 1, 2012. There is nothing in the record to indicate\nwhether Decker's suspension actually expired, whether it was\nextended, or whether Decker has since been suspended again for\nother reasons. In the time this case has taken to come before\nus, the terms of Decker's suspension might very well have\nchanged, and we decline to speculate on its current status. The\nparties are free to request an amendment to the injunction from\nthe circuit court if they have additional particularized needs\nor concerns that pertain to facts not before us.\n\n                                     31\n\f                                                                             No.     2011AP2902\n\n\n\n    ¶51      We conclude the circuit court properly determined that\n\na harassment injunction can be granted to protect the Board of\n\nRegents from Decker's harassing behavior, and it provided ample\n\nsupport for its reasoning on a difficult issue that implicated\n\nboth First Amendment and public safety concerns. However, we\n\nremand to the circuit court to refine the injunction and clarify\n\nits terms.\n\n                                      IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n    ¶52      We     hold     that     Wis.       Stat.      § 813.125          can     extend\n\ninjunctive        protection    to     institutions             as    well     as     natural\n\npersons. We further hold that the circuit court's decision to\n\ngrant   a   harassment       injunction       was     a    proper      exercise       of     its\n\ndiscretion, and sufficient evidence existed for the court to\n\nfind that Decker's conduct constituted harassment and lacked a\n\nlegitimate        purpose.   However,        because        the      parties       agree     the\n\ninjunction was overbroad, we remand to the circuit court to\n\nfurther clarify the scope of the injunction. For these reasons,\n\nthe decision of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause\nis remanded to the circuit court.\n\n    By      the    Court.—The       decision     of       the   court    of        appeals    is\n\nreversed, and the cause is remanded to the circuit court for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    ¶53      ANN WALSH BRADLEY, J., did not participate.\n\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\f                                                                       2011AP2902.ssa\n\n\n     ¶54    SHIRLEY S.

The    majority    opinion\n\ncorrectly asserts that the circuit court's harassment injunction\n\nfails to identify the protected party and fails to specify the\n\nconduct to be enjoined.3\n     ¶55    Because the injunction is overbroad, the injunction is\n\ninvalid.4         On    remand,     the   circuit   court       must    refine    the\n\ninjunction and clarify its terms.

The petitioner being protected by the injunction must\n\n             be specific and named;15\n\n     II.     The   harassing   conduct    that    is   the   basis   for   the\n\n             injunction must be set forth;16\n     14\n          Bachowski, 139 Wis. 2d at 414.\n     15\n       Wis.

The Bachowski court stated:     \"Thus, it would be\ninsufficient, for example, pursuant to sec. 813.125(5)(a) for a\npetitioner to simply allege that he or she has been 'harassed or\nintimidated' by the [defendant].\"     Bachowski, 139 Wis. 2d at\n412-13.\n                                5\n\f                                                              2011AP2902.ssa\n\n\n    III. The specific harassing acts or conduct to be enjoined\n\n          must be either identical to or substantially similar\n\n          to the conduct found to be harassing by the circuit\n\n          court;17 and\n\n    IV.   An injunction must be \"specific as to the acts and\n\n          conduct which are enjoined\" such that the defendant\n\n          has   notice   of   what   he   or   she   is   prohibited   from\n\n          doing.18\n                                     I\n\n    ¶62   To assist the circuit court, I begin with the first\n\nBachowski criterion:      the petitioner and the party protected\n\nmust be specific and named.\n\n    ¶63   In the instant case, a real issue exists about who the\n\npetitioner is and who the protected party is.             They need not be\n\nthe same person.\n\n    17\n       \"Only the acts or conduct which are proven at trial and\nform the basis of the judge's finding of harassment or\nsubstantially similar conduct should be enjoined.\"  Bachowski,\n139 Wis. 2d at 414.\n\n     See also III Wisconsin Judicial Benchbook, Family Actions,\nMiscellaneous Actions, Harassment FA 18-54 (4th ed. 2011)\n(similarly   stating  the  injunction  \"must  be   tailored  to\nnecessities of particular case\").

In its oral ruling, the circuit court stated\n\nthat    Decker   was   \"specifically       prohibited   from   contacting   or\n\ncausing any person to contact              the UW or its representatives\n\nunless they consent in writing\" (emphasis added).               I agree with\n\nthe majority opinion that it is \"unclear to both Decker and law\n\nenforcement who the protected party is.\"19\n\n       ¶65   The circuit court's injunction appears to include as\nprotected parties between 18 individuals (the individual members\n\nof the Board of Regents) and 200,000 or more individuals (the\n\nstudents, staff, and faculty of the university).\n\n       ¶66   The lack of clarity of the protected party's identity\n\nin the circuit court's injunction renders it invalid under the\n\nfirst Bachowski criterion:      the protected party is undefined and\n\nunknown.

Trespass     in    turn        is    based    on\n\nDecker's status as a suspended student.20\n\n      ¶69   The     circuit     court   described      the    trespasses          as    the\n\nharassing conduct, as follows:\n\n      [T]here are several incidents described as a matter of\n      the record here that Mr. Decker, contrary to the clear\n      terms   of   the   lawful  existing   order    that  is\n      established . . . .

I do not address the statutory language \"serves no\n\nlegitimate purpose.\"29\n\n\n      28\n       The statutory definition of \"harassment\" is problematic;\n\"harassment\" is defined as \"acts which harass,\" a form of the\nvery word being defined.\n\n     To grant an injunction, the circuit court must find\nreasonable grounds to believe that the person has engaged in\nharassment with the intent to harass or intimidate a named party\nand   which  serves   no   legitimate  purpose.

PROSSER,      J.       (concurring).            The    majority\n\nopinion makes a powerful case for the issuance of a harassment\n\ninjunction against Jeffrey Decker (Decker).                          Decker's campaign\n\nregarding the use of student segregated fees in the University\n\nof Wisconsin System has been self-defeating because his tactics\n\nalienate     people        who   might       otherwise        share     his       concerns.\n\nWhatever Decker's message is, it is completely overshadowed by\n\nhis   tactics,        which      have     crossed        the     line        and     become\n\nunreasonable.        I concur in the majority opinion because I agree\n\nthat something had to be done.\n\n      ¶93   I   also       agree      with       the   majority       (and        with   the\n\nconcurrence     of    the     Chief     Justice)       that    the    circuit       court's\n\ninjunction is too broad and must be redone.                           If a remand for\n\nrevision were not part of the majority opinion, I would feel\n\nobligated to dissent.\n\n      ¶94   Having explained my reasons for concurrence, I must\n\nregister my reservations about the interpretation of Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 813.125.\n\n      ¶95   In my view, this statute was never intended to cover\n\ninstitutions as well as natural persons.                        It was intended to\n\naddress a wide variety of harassment problems when people have\n\nto deal with the irrational conduct of other people.                              Thus, the\n\nremedies that must be afforded to an abused spouse, and may be\n\nafforded to a corporate officer or a member of the University of\n\nWisconsin Board of Regents as an individual, are not the same as\nthe remedies that may be afforded to everyone who is part of a\n\ncorporation or an educational institution.\n                                             1\n\f                                                                            No.    2011AP2902.dtp\n\n\n      ¶96    Once the court determines that the broad definition of\n\n\"person\"1 applies to an institution as a victim, then necessarily\n\nit   also   applies      to      an   institution       as    a    perpetrator.                I    am\n\nconfident        that        many      people        believe           some       institution,\n\nassociation,      or    body        politic    or    corporate         is     engaging         in    a\n\ncourse of conduct to harass or intimidate them in a manner that\n\nserves no legitimate purpose.\n\n      ¶97    The statute has been interpreted more broadly than I\n\nwould     read   it     in    Village     of       Tigerton       v.

App. 1997), and now in this\n\ncase.     But the legislature has failed to give much guidance on\n\nhow judges should apply the statute in these cases.                                     This lack\n\nof guidance is bound to spawn future controversy.\n\n      ¶98    I respectfully suggest that the legislature review the\n\nlanguage and effectiveness of all the specialized statutes on\n\ninjunctions and restraining orders in Wis. Stat. ch. 813 and\n\nconsider     adopting        a   new    statute       for    \"persons\"            who    are       not\n\npeople.\n      ¶99    For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Wis.
