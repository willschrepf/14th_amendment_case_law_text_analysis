Short, 2015-Ohio-3183.]\n\n\nGwin, P.J.\n\n        {¶1} Defendant-appellant            Christopher   Short   [“Short”]   appeals   from   his\n\nconvictions and sentences after a jury trial in the Richland County Court of Common\n\nPleas on one count of rape and four counts of domestic violence.\n\n                                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        INTRODUCTION.\n\n        {¶2} Short was indicted in two cases.

The jury found Short “Not Guilty” on Count 10, Abduction, a felony of the third\n\ndegree\n\n       {¶7} The trial court sentenced Short on July 15, 2014. He was found to be a tier\n\nIII sex offender and ordered to serve a total of 13.5 years of incarceration.\n\n       CASE NO. 2012-CR-0429 – JULY 1, 2012 – A.S.\n\n       {¶8} Short was married to A.S. in 2008. In February 2010, Short had a domestic\n\nviolence incident with A.S. Short eventually pleaded guilty to this as a misdemeanor\n\ndomestic violence.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                       4\n\n\n       {¶9}    During 2009 and 2010, B.S. worked with Short and A.S. at School\n\nSpecialty, a factory making school supplies. B.S. was friends with the couple during her\n\nemployment there. However, they grew apart when Short asked B.S. for nude photos\n\none night during drinking. Shortly after that, Short and B.S. were laid off and A.S. took\n\nanother job.\n\n       {¶10} In May of 2012, Short found B.S. on Facebook and contacted her. Things\n\ndeveloped and they began to have an extramarital affair. This affair was discovered by\n\nA.S. Short and A.S. separated in mid-June. The two began sharing the house on\n\nalternating days. One night, A.S. would be home at night with their daughter, the next\n\nnight A.S. would leave and Short would be home with their daughter. During this period,\n\nShort continued his affair with B.S.\n\n       {¶11} On June 30, 2012, Short and B.S. devised a plan to see if A.S. had B.S.'s\n\ncar keyed. Short planned to text A.S. and eventually meet with her and convince A.S.\n\nthat he had broken up with B.S. After that, Short would attempt to get A.S. to admit to\n\nhaving someone key B.S.'s vehicle.\n\n       {¶12} On July 1, 2012, Short texted A.S. asking to come to the house. A.S. told\n\nhim not to come to their home. Nonetheless, after A.S. had put their child to bed, Short\n\narrived knocking at the back glass door. A.S. opened the door and spoke to Short. She\n\nfound him to be drunk but in a good mood, so she let him in to talk. Short stated that he\n\nhad broken up with B.S. and wanted to get back together with A.S. Short then called\n\nB.S. and purported to break up with B.S. in front of A.S. A.S. took the phone from Short\n\nand yelled at B.S. that she had succeeded in keeping her husband.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        5\n\n\n         {¶13} After hanging up the phone, A.S. told Short that she was not back with him\n\nand she was not going to have sex with him. A.S. merely wanted to hurt B.S. and\n\nwanted Short to choose her; she had no interest in patching up her relationship with\n\nShort.\n\n         {¶14} Short came over to the couch A.S. was sitting on and told her they would\n\nhave sex. A.S. refused and Short yanked off A.S.'s pajama pants and began to stick\n\nfingers in her vagina. A.S. began to kick Short and tried to push him off, but he held her\n\ndown. Short then attempted to perform oral sex on A.S., but she pulled away and fell to\n\nthe floor. A.S. attempted to stand, but Short was behind her and put his arms around\n\nher neck, choking her. A.S. began to black out and heard a popping sound in her neck.\n\nShort stated that he would kill A.S. if she did not have sex with him. A.S. then stopped\n\nfighting back, but still told Short to stop. Short forced A.S. to perform oral sex on him,\n\nstated that he is raping A.S. and will ejaculate in her mouth to not leave any evidence.\n\nA.S. was gagging and could not breathe. Short then vaginally penetrated A.S.\n\n         {¶15} Short wanted to go to the bedroom and complete copulation. A.S. initially\n\ndenied but agreed to go for fear of her life. On the way there, A.S. asked to get a glass\n\nof water from the kitchen. When A.S. had gotten far enough away from Short, she fled\n\nout the sliding glass doors in only a shirt.\n\n         {¶16} The next-door neighbor was not home, so A.S. fled to the next neighbor\n\nover, David Willis. A.S. knocked on the door until Mr. Willis answered. A.S. was\n\nhysterical and wearing nothing but a grey shirt. A.S.'s hair was messed up, she was\n\ncrying, and her face was red. A.S. requested that Mr. Willis call 9-1-1 because Short\n\nhad just hit her, choked her, and potentially raped her. He did so and gave her\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                          6\n\n\nsweatpants to wear. A.S. reported that she was abused and raped on the 9-1-1 call.\n\nDuring this time, Short got into his vehicle and fled.\n\n       {¶17} A.S. went back to her house accompanied by Mr. Willis. Officers Jeffrey\n\nGillis and Larry Schacherer from the Mansfield Police Department arrived on the scene\n\nwithin 10 minutes. They took statements from A.S. and Mr. Willis. They collected a\n\ndomestic violence packet from A.S., which included an affidavit where A.S. told them\n\nthat Short choked her and raped her. They did not notice any visible injuries during this\n\ninterview.\n\n       {¶18} A.S. reported to SANE Nurse Elaine Siewert similar information that she\n\nhad provided to the police officers. A SANE exam was performed and Nurse Siewert\n\nnoted injuries to A.S.'s neck and back. She further noted A.S. reported pain in her neck,\n\nback, left wrist, and left cheek. Redness was seen in and around the vagina, which\n\nshowed blunt force trauma in that area. DNA swabs were collected from the vaginal\n\nregion of A.S. There were no bruises noted at the time. Officer Gillis took photographs\n\nof the injuries of A.S. at the hospital.\n\n       {¶19} Short was arrested by Lexington Police Department in the home of his\n\nmother that night. When being transported to the jail Short commented to Officer\n\nSchacherer that, \"I [Short] read where a lot of people have been charged with rape but\n\nnobody ever gets convicted with it.” Short initially told officers that he was not at A.S.'s\n\nhouse that day, then he changed his story to having been there earlier in the day and no\n\nsex occurred. Short then he changed his story to he and A.S. had consensual sex at\n\naround 4:00 p.m. Short’s injuries were photographed by Office Schacherer. Short had\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                         7\n\n\nbite marks on his arm. Short explained these marks as rough play with his friends at the\n\nlake. When Short ultimately testified at trial, he stated that all of these were lies.\n\n       {¶20} The following day, A.S. texted B.S. In these texts, A.S. told B.S. what had\n\noccurred, namely that the Short had choked her until she blacked out and forced her to\n\nhave sex with him with threats of death.\n\n       {¶21} The DNA collected for the SANE exam was analyzed. There was no\n\nsemen present on the oral, anal, or vaginal swab. However, on the swab of A.S.'s right\n\nbreast, there was DNA of Short and A.S.\n\n       {¶22} Short was released on bond and began living at his mother's house in\n\nLexington, Ohio. He continued to see B.S. Short was divorced from A.S. and he\n\nbecame engaged to B.S. on December 4, 2012.\n\n       CASE NO. 2014-CR-0200 – JANUARY 2013 THROUGH MARCH 2014 – B.S.\n\n       {¶23} In January 2013, Short became violent with B.S. during a sexual encounter\n\nin his vehicle. B.S. was performing oral sex on Short when he struck her in the back of\n\nher head and he grabbed her hair very roughly, stating that she would be bald when he\n\nwas done with her. He eventually threw her glasses out of the vehicle. B.S. did not\n\noriginally report this incident because she loved Short at the time and believed him\n\nwhen he apologized later.\n\n       {¶24} In June 2013, Short again became abusive with B.S. Short requested sex\n\nfrom B.S. and she declined. Short took her glasses and started hitting her. B.S. ran to\n\nthe kitchen and she grabbed what she thought was a knife, but was really an icing\n\nspatula. Short came at her, took the spatula, and began hitting her on the top of the\n\nhead with a closed fist. Short’s mother then came downstairs and told Short to stop.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                       8\n\n\nB.S. fled to a gas station. B.S. did not report this incident because of Short’s pending\n\ncharge involving A.S.\n\n       {¶25} B.S. testified that the abusive relationship with Short grew over time and\n\nshe became more and more afraid of him. She stated that she made three statements\n\nover the pendency of the 2012 case to attempt to assist Short in his defense. Each of\n\nthese statements were at Short’s direction and were made to appease him. These\n\nstatements were largely based solely on what Short told B.S. and were untrue as far as\n\nshe knew.\n\n       {¶26} On March 1, 2014, B.S. was driving to Wal-Mart with Short. Short became\n\nangry with B.S., took out the car keys, and began sawing at her fingers with the keys.\n\nLater that night, while B.S. was staying the night with Short, Short wanted sex from B.S.\n\nand she refused. Short, grabbed her stomach and twisted it painfully. Both then fell\n\nasleep for a short time. About two hours later, Short awakened B.S. demanding sex.\n\nB.S. again refused and Short wrenched B.S.'s legs apart and stated she was his wife\n\nand he could have sex with her whether she wanted to or not. B.S. began crying but\n\ndecided to allow the intercourse. Short went from vaginal sex to penetrating B.S. anally.\n\nWhen he did so, B.S. screamed out in pain. Short covered B.S.'s mouth and began\n\nchoking her to gag her screams so his mother would not hear. Short told B.S. that she\n\nwas dead when he was choking her. Short eventually ejaculated in B.S.'s anus and then\n\nwent to sleep. B.S. lay awake crying, but eventually fell asleep.\n\n       {¶27} The next morning, B.S. wanted to leave but could not find a time to escape.\n\nShort requested sex from B.S. again, which she again denied. Short then proceeded to\n\nhit her on the hip five to seven times, causing injuries to B.S. Short claimed he would\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        9\n\n\nstop hitting B.S. when she is right. Short then went to the bathroom. B.S. took the\n\nopportunity to flee the house. She initially went to the Lexington Police Department, but\n\ndecided not to wait to be helped for fear that Short would find her, so she left.\n\n       {¶28} Short proceeded over the next two days to text and call B.S. He was\n\nbegging B.S. to talk to him and that he was very sorry. B.S. met with Short in public.\n\nShe spoke to Short from her vehicle with the doors locked and the window cracked.\n\nB.S. recorded the conversation with her phone, which was played for the jury. That\n\nconversation had Short apologize profusely and guaranteeing that he will change.\n\n       {¶29} On Monday morning, B.S. went to get a civil protection order, which she\n\nsecured by noon. B.S. then went to Lexington Police Station, met with officers, and\n\nreported the recent incident. B.S. saw a doctor because her organs were tender, and he\n\nnoted some injuries. B.S. was not informed to do a SANE exam until later, which she\n\ncompleted that Wednesday.\n\n       {¶30} At the SANE exam, some bruising was noted and recorded. There was\n\ndiffuse redness on her cervical os and scant bloody drainage noted. Following the\n\nSANE exam, B.S. met with another Lexington Police Officer to report the rape, as they\n\nhad not noticed she complained of both domestic violence and rape previously.\n\n       SHORT TESTIFIES AT TRIAL.\n\n       {¶31} Short testified in this case. He admitted to both of his prior domestic\n\nviolence convictions in 2004 and 2010. Short claimed, regarding the 2012 incident with\n\nA.S., that A.S. let him in the front door and that they had consensual sex after the phone\n\ncall with B.S. During the sex, when they were going to the bedroom, A.S. went to the\n\nglass door, smiled at him mischievously, and left. Smith then drove to his mother's\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        10\n\n\nhouse. Short denied the allegations of domestic violence and rape that night. Short did\n\nstate that he was scared when he was arrested that night, so he lied in his statement to\n\nofficers.\n\n       {¶32} Short denied the allegations of physical and sexual abuse against B.S.\n\nShort denied that he and B.S. had sex the night of March 1 to March 2, 2014. Short\n\nstated that she smacked B.S.'s thigh playfully on March 2, 2014.\n\n       {¶33} Generally, Short testified at trial that both A.S. and B.S. injured themselves\n\nso that they could create false charges of domestic violence and rape against him.\n\n       SENTENCE.\n\n       {¶34} On July 15, 2014, Short was sentenced in Case No: 2012-CR-0429, to the\n\nOhio State prison system on Count 1 for a mandatory nine years and Count 2, eighteen\n\nmonths. The trial court ordered the sentences to be served consecutive to each other\n\nand also consecutive to his sentence in Case No. 2014-CR-0200. Short was also found\n\nto be a tier three sex offender.\n\n       {¶35} In Case No. 2014-CR-0200, Short was sentenced to the Ohio State prison\n\nsystem on Count 5 for three years, and on Count 6 for 6 months in the Richland County\n\nJail, the Court merged Count 7 with Count 6.\n\n       {¶36} The Court in the Sentencing Entry shows that Counts 5 and 6 are to run\n\nconcurrent to each other. Count 5 is to run consecutively with Case No: 2012-CR-0429\n\nfor a total sentence of thirteen and one-half years in prison. This Sentencing includes\n\nthree years of mandatory post release control.\n\n                                      Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶37} Short raises one assignment of error,\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                          11\n\n\n       {¶38} “I. THE APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS SIXTH AMENDMENT\n\nRIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS THE TRIAL COUNSEL DID\n\nNOT OBJECT TO THE MOTION OF JOINDER FILED BY THE APPELLEE.”\n\n                                             Analysis\n\n       {¶39} In his sole assignment of error, Short argues that his trial counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to object to the state's motion for joinder of Case No. 2012-CR-\n\n0429 involving A.S. that had occurred in 2012 and Case No. 2014-CR-0200 that\n\ninvolved B.S. and had occurred in 2013-2014.\n\n       {¶40} A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a two-prong analysis.\n\nThe first inquiry is whether counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonable representation involving a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's\n\nessential duties to appellant. The second prong is whether the appellant was prejudiced\n\nby counsel's ineffectiveness. Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122\n\nL.Ed.2d 180(1993); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d\n\n674(1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373(1989).\n\n       {¶41} In order to warrant a finding that trial counsel was ineffective, the petitioner\n\nmust meet both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland and\n\nBradley. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U.S. 111, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1419, 173 L.Ed.2d\n\n251(2009).\n\n       {¶42} Recently, the United States Supreme Court discussed the prejudice prong\n\nof the Strickland test,\n\n             With respect to prejudice, a challenger must demonstrate “a\n\n       reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                          12\n\n\n      result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable\n\n      probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\n\n      outcome.” Id., at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. It is not enough “to show that the\n\n      errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.”\n\n      Id., at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel’s errors must be “so serious as to\n\n      deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.” Id., at\n\n      687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.\n\n            “Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy task.” Padilla v.\n\n      Kentucky, 559 U.S. ––––, ––––, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1485, 176 L.Ed.2d 284\n\n      (2010). An ineffective-assistance claim can function as a way to escape\n\n      rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial, and\n\n      so the Strickland standard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest\n\n      “intrusive post-trial inquiry” threaten the integrity of the very adversary\n\n      process the right to counsel is meant to serve. Strickland, 466 U.S., at\n\n      689–690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Even under de novo review, the standard for\n\n      judging counsel’s representation is a most deferential one. Unlike a later\n\n      reviewing court, the attorney observed the relevant proceedings, knew of\n\n      materials outside the record, and interacted with the client, with opposing\n\n      counsel, and with the judge. It is “all too tempting” to “second-guess\n\n      counsel’s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.” Id., at 689,\n\n      104 S.Ct. 2052; see also Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 702, 122 S.Ct. 1843,\n\n      152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 372, 113\n\n      S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993). The question is whether an attorney’s\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        13\n\n\n       representation amounted to incompetence under “prevailing professional\n\n       norms,” not whether it deviated from best practices or most common\n\n       custom. Strickland, 466 U.S., at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.\n\nHarrington v. Richter, __U.S.__, 131 S.Ct. 770, 777-778, 178 L.Ed.2d 624(2011).\n\n       {¶43} In cases involving a failure to make a motion on behalf of the defendant or\n\noppose a motion by the state, a defendant is required to: (1) show that the motion or\n\nopposition thereto was meritorious, and (2) show that there was a reasonable\n\nprobability that the verdict would have been different had the motion been made or\n\nopposed. State v. Santana, 90 Ohio St.3d 513, 739 N.E.2d 798(2001); State v. Lott, 51\n\nOhio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293(1990).\n\n       Joinder.\n\n       {¶44} Joinder is appropriate where the evidence is interlocking and the jury is\n\ncapable of segregating the proof required for each offense. State v. Czajka, 101 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 564, 577-578, 656 N.E.2d 9 (8th Dist. 1995). Nonetheless, if it appears that a\n\ncriminal defendant would be prejudiced by such joinder, then the trial court is required to\n\norder separate trials. Crim.R. 14.\n\n       {¶45} When a defendant claims that he or she was prejudiced by the joinder of\n\nmultiple offenses, the court must determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes\n\nwould be admissible even if the counts were severed; and (2) if not, whether the\n\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct. State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 59,\n\n600 N.E.2d 661(1992), citing State v. Hamblin, 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 158-159, 524 N.E.2d\n\n476(1988) and Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85(D.C.Cir. 1964). \"If the evidence of\n\nother crimes would be admissible at separate trials, any 'prejudice that might result from\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                       14\n\n\nthe jury's hearing the evidence of the other crime in a joint trial would be no different\n\nfrom that possible in separate trials,' and a court need not inquire further.\" Schaim,\n\nsupra, quoting Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d at 90.\n\n       {¶46} In the case at bar, the state argues the evidence of each offense would\n\nhave been admissible at separate trials pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). Accordingly, we\n\nmust determine the extent to which evidence of each of these crimes would be\n\nadmissible in other trials if the counts were severed.\n\n       Other Acts.\n\n       {¶47} In discussing the dangers associated with admitting other acts evidence in\n\na case where the offenses included several counts of rape and gross sexual imposition,\n\nthe Schaim court stated:\n\n             The admissibility of other acts evidence is carefully limited because\n\n       of the substantial danger that the jury will convict the defendant solely\n\n       because it assumes that the defendant has a propensity to commit\n\n       criminal acts, or deserves punishment regardless of whether he or she\n\n       committed the crime charged in the indictment. * * * This danger is\n\n       particularly high when the other acts are very similar to the charged\n\n       offense, or of an inflammatory nature, as is certainly true in this case. The\n\n       legislature has recognized the problems raised by the admission of other\n\n       acts evidence in prosecutions for sexual offenses, and has carefully\n\n       limited the circumstances in which evidence of the defendant's other\n\n       sexual activity is admissible. The forcible rape statute and the gross\n\n       sexual imposition statute both contain subsections that address the\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        15\n\n\n      admissibility of evidence of other sexual activity by either the victim or the\n\n      defendant. * * *\n\n65 Ohio St.3d at 59-60, 600 N.E.2d 661.\n\n      {¶48} The legislature has recognized the problems raised by the admission of\n\nother acts evidence in prosecutions for sexual offenses, and has carefully limited the\n\ncircumstances in which evidence of the defendant's other sexual activity is admissible.\n\nThe rape statute and the gross sexual imposition statute both contain subsections that\n\naddress the admissibility of evidence of other sexual activity by either the victim or the\n\ndefendant. Schaim, supra. (Footnotes omitted). Because of the severe social stigma\n\nattached to crimes of sexual assault and child molestation, evidence of these past acts\n\nposes a higher risk, on the whole, of influencing the jury to punish the defendant for the\n\nsimilar act rather than the charged act. Accordingly, the state may not “parade past the\n\njury a litany of potentially prejudicial similar acts that have been established or\n\nconnected to the defendant only by unsubstantiated innuendo.” Huddleston v. United\n\nStates, 485 U.S. 681, 689, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771(1988).\n\n      {¶49} Evidence of other acts is admissible if (1) there is substantial proof that the\n\nalleged other acts were committed by the defendant, and (2) the evidence tends to\n\nprove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of\n\nmistake or accident. State v. Carter, 26 Ohio St.2d 79, 83, 269 N.E.2d 115, 117(1971);\n\nState v. Lowe, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 1994-Ohio-345, 634 N.E.2d 616, 619. (Citing\n\nState v. Broom, 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 282-283, 533 N.E.2d 682, 690-691(1988); Evid.R.\n\n404(B); R.C. 2945.59.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        16\n\n\n       {¶50} Further, the prior act must not be too remote and must be closely related in\n\nnature, time, and place to the offense charged. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 60, 600\n\nN.E.2d at 669. A prior act which is “ * * * too distant in time or too removed in method or\n\ntype has no permissible probative value.” State v. Snowden, 49 Ohio App.2d 7, 10, 359\n\nN.E.2d 87, 91(1st Dist. 1976); State v. Burson, 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 159, 67 O.O.2d 174,\n\n175, 311 N.E.2d 526, 529(1974).\n\n       {¶51} Whether Short committed a crime is the crux of the dispute. If a crime did in\n\nfact occur, no dispute exists that Short was the perpetrator. In other words, no dispute\n\nexists as to identity. As the identity of the person who raped and abused A.S. and B.S.\n\nwas not an issue at trial, the other acts are not properly admitted to prove the Short’s\n\nscheme, plan, or system in committing the crimes charged. See, State v. Curry, 43 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 66, 330 N.E.2d 720(1975); State v. Miley, 5th Dist. Richland Nos. 2005-CA-67,\n\n2006-CA-14, 2006-Ohio-4670, ¶73. However, the Supreme Court has subsequently\n\nlimited this holding,\n\n             Pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), * * * evidence of other crimes, wrongs,\n\n       or acts of an accused may be admissible to prove intent or plan, even if\n\n       the identity of an accused or the immediate background of a crime is not\n\n       at issue.\n\nState v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 522, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, 1280, ¶\n\n2 (2012).\n\n       {¶52} Williams gives us a framework within which to evaluate the other-acts\n\nevidence:\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        17\n\n\n         The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant\n\n      to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\n\n      action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\n\n      Evid.R. 401. The next step is to consider whether evidence of the other\n\n      crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused\n\n      in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts\n\n      evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in\n\n      Evid.R. 404(B). The third step is to consider whether the probative value\n\n      of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\n      unfair prejudice. See Evid.R. 403.\n\nState v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 526, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, 1283, ¶\n\n20 (2012).\n\n      {¶53} The circumstances surrounding each rape and each incident of domestic\n\nviolence in this case are relevant in making it more likely Short had sex with an unwilling\n\nvictim by using physical violence and or threats. The evidence pertaining to each\n\noffense does have the tendency to prove Short engaged in a similar plan or method of\n\nconduct with both victims and to prove his motive, intent, or plan. The immediate\n\nsimilarity between the charges in both cases is a request for sex that is denied,\n\nviolence, threats of violence and forced sexual conduct. Both assaults have further\n\nsimilarities: Short held his hand over the victims’ mouths, chocked them and later\n\napologized to them.\n\n      {¶54} The third step in the analysis is whether the probative value of each\n\nincident is outweighed by the prejudice risked in its admission. Unfair prejudice is that\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                         18\n\nquality of evidence that might result in an improper basis for a jury decision. State v.\n\nCrotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302 ¶ 24. Because fairness is\n\nsubjective, the determination whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused. Id.,\n\nciting State v. Robb, 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019 (2000).\n\n      {¶55} We note the trial court gave a limiting instruction that each of the offenses\n\ncharged in this case constitutes a separate and distinct matter and that the jury must\n\nconsider each charge and the evidence applicable to each charge separately, and then\n\nstate their finding as to each charge uninfluenced by your verdict as to any other charge\n\nWe presume the jury followed those instructions. See, Williams, supra, 134 Ohio St.3d\n\n521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, at ¶ 23, citing State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d\n\n49, 59, 656 N.E.2d 623 (1995) and Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 195, 559 N.E.2d\n\n1313 (1990). Indeed, in B.S.’s case, Case No 2014-CR-0200, the jury found Short “Not\n\nGuility” on Counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 all Domestic Violence, felonies of the third degree; “Not\n\nGuilty” on Counts 8 and 9, both counts being Rape, a felony of the first degree. The jury\n\nfurther found Short “Not Guilty” on Count 10, Abduction, a felony of the third degree.\n\n       {¶56} Assuming, arguendo, that the evidence did not fit the \"other acts\"\n\nexception, it nevertheless fits the second prong of the Schaim test which requires the\n\nevidence of the crime under each indictment to be simple and distinct. 65 Ohio St.3d at\n\n59. In State v. Decker, 88 Ohio App.3d 544, 624 N.E.2d 350(1st Dist. 1993), the court\n\nfound that the evidence was simple and distinct. The evidence achieved these\n\ncharacteristics in part because the crimes involved contained different victims and\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                         19\n\n\ndifferent witnesses, and therefore, the jury was able to segregate the facts that\n\nconstituted each crime. Decker, 88 Ohio App.3d at 549.\n\n       {¶57} In this case, the prosecution introduced evidence of each distinct crime.\n\nBoth A.S. and B.S. testified at length and in specific detail about how the abuse\n\noccurred, when it began, and how long it continued. The issues were clearly laid out for\n\nthe jury, and the jury was instructed that each count and victim should be considered\n\nfrom its own evidence. As previously noted, the jury found Short “Not Guility” of seven\n\ncounts in the case involving B.S.\n\n       {¶58} Thus, as in Decker, the evidence was simple and distinct because the facts\n\nsurrounding each crime were capable of segregation.\n\n       {¶59} Accordingly, because Short was not able to demonstrate that he was\n\nprejudiced by the joinder of the cases, he cannot meet the first element of the Schaim\n\ntest. Therefore, we do not need to address the remaining elements of the test.\n\n       {¶60} Given the facts sub judice, we find that counsel was not ineffective in failing\n\nto file a motion to sever the cases.\n\n       {¶61} Short’s sole assignment of error is overruled.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                 20\n\n\n      {¶62} The judgment of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nBy Gwin, P.J.,\n\nWise, J., and\n\nDelaney, J., concur\n\f",

He was found to be a tier\n\nIII sex offender and ordered to serve a total of 13.5 years of incarceration.\n\n       CASE NO. 2012-CR-0429 – JULY 1, 2012 – A.S.\n\n       {¶8} Short was married to A.S. in 2008. In February 2010, Short had a domestic\n\nviolence incident with A.S. Short eventually pleaded guilty to this as a misdemeanor\n\ndomestic violence.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                       4\n\n\n       {¶9}    During 2009 and 2010, B.S. worked with Short and A.S. at School\n\nSpecialty, a factory making school supplies. B.S. was friends with the couple during her\n\nemployment there. However, they grew apart when Short asked B.S. for nude photos\n\none night during drinking. Shortly after that, Short and B.S. were laid off and A.S. took\n\nanother job.\n\n       {¶10} In May of 2012, Short found B.S. on Facebook and contacted her. Things\n\ndeveloped and they began to have an extramarital affair. This affair was discovered by\n\nA.S. Short and A.S. separated in mid-June. The two began sharing the house on\n\nalternating days. One night, A.S. would be home at night with their daughter, the next\n\nnight A.S. would leave and Short would be home with their daughter. During this period,\n\nShort continued his affair with B.S.\n\n       {¶11} On June 30, 2012, Short and B.S. devised a plan to see if A.S. had B.S.'s\n\ncar keyed. Short planned to text A.S. and eventually meet with her and convince A.S.\n\nthat he had broken up with B.S. After that, Short would attempt to get A.S. to admit to\n\nhaving someone key B.S.'s vehicle.\n\n       {¶12} On July 1, 2012, Short texted A.S. asking to come to the house. A.S. told\n\nhim not to come to their home. Nonetheless, after A.S. had put their child to bed, Short\n\narrived knocking at the back glass door. A.S. opened the door and spoke to Short. She\n\nfound him to be drunk but in a good mood, so she let him in to talk. Short stated that he\n\nhad broken up with B.S. and wanted to get back together with A.S. Short then called\n\nB.S. and purported to break up with B.S. in front of A.S. A.S. took the phone from Short\n\nand yelled at B.S. that she had succeeded in keeping her husband.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        5\n\n\n         {¶13} After hanging up the phone, A.S. told Short that she was not back with him\n\nand she was not going to have sex with him. A.S. merely wanted to hurt B.S. and\n\nwanted Short to choose her; she had no interest in patching up her relationship with\n\nShort.\n\n         {¶14} Short came over to the couch A.S. was sitting on and told her they would\n\nhave sex. A.S. refused and Short yanked off A.S.'s pajama pants and began to stick\n\nfingers in her vagina. A.S. began to kick Short and tried to push him off, but he held her\n\ndown. Short then attempted to perform oral sex on A.S., but she pulled away and fell to\n\nthe floor. A.S. attempted to stand, but Short was behind her and put his arms around\n\nher neck, choking her. A.S. began to black out and heard a popping sound in her neck.\n\nShort stated that he would kill A.S. if she did not have sex with him. A.S. then stopped\n\nfighting back, but still told Short to stop. Short forced A.S. to perform oral sex on him,\n\nstated that he is raping A.S. and will ejaculate in her mouth to not leave any evidence.\n\nA.S. was gagging and could not breathe. Short then vaginally penetrated A.S.\n\n         {¶15} Short wanted to go to the bedroom and complete copulation. A.S. initially\n\ndenied but agreed to go for fear of her life. On the way there, A.S. asked to get a glass\n\nof water from the kitchen. When A.S. had gotten far enough away from Short, she fled\n\nout the sliding glass doors in only a shirt.\n\n         {¶16} The next-door neighbor was not home, so A.S. fled to the next neighbor\n\nover, David Willis. A.S. knocked on the door until Mr. Willis answered. A.S. was\n\nhysterical and wearing nothing but a grey shirt. A.S.'s hair was messed up, she was\n\ncrying, and her face was red. A.S. requested that Mr. Willis call 9-1-1 because Short\n\nhad just hit her, choked her, and potentially raped her. He did so and gave her\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                          6\n\n\nsweatpants to wear. A.S. reported that she was abused and raped on the 9-1-1 call.\n\nDuring this time, Short got into his vehicle and fled.\n\n       {¶17} A.S. went back to her house accompanied by Mr. Willis. Officers Jeffrey\n\nGillis and Larry Schacherer from the Mansfield Police Department arrived on the scene\n\nwithin 10 minutes. They took statements from A.S. and Mr. Willis. They collected a\n\ndomestic violence packet from A.S., which included an affidavit where A.S. told them\n\nthat Short choked her and raped her. They did not notice any visible injuries during this\n\ninterview.\n\n       {¶18} A.S. reported to SANE Nurse Elaine Siewert similar information that she\n\nhad provided to the police officers. A SANE exam was performed and Nurse Siewert\n\nnoted injuries to A.S.'s neck and back. She further noted A.S. reported pain in her neck,\n\nback, left wrist, and left cheek. Redness was seen in and around the vagina, which\n\nshowed blunt force trauma in that area. DNA swabs were collected from the vaginal\n\nregion of A.S. There were no bruises noted at the time. Officer Gillis took photographs\n\nof the injuries of A.S. at the hospital.\n\n       {¶19} Short was arrested by Lexington Police Department in the home of his\n\nmother that night. When being transported to the jail Short commented to Officer\n\nSchacherer that, \"I [Short] read where a lot of people have been charged with rape but\n\nnobody ever gets convicted with it.” Short initially told officers that he was not at A.S.'s\n\nhouse that day, then he changed his story to having been there earlier in the day and no\n\nsex occurred. Short then he changed his story to he and A.S. had consensual sex at\n\naround 4:00 p.m. Short’s injuries were photographed by Office Schacherer. Short had\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                         7\n\n\nbite marks on his arm. Short explained these marks as rough play with his friends at the\n\nlake. When Short ultimately testified at trial, he stated that all of these were lies.\n\n       {¶20} The following day, A.S. texted B.S. In these texts, A.S. told B.S. what had\n\noccurred, namely that the Short had choked her until she blacked out and forced her to\n\nhave sex with him with threats of death.\n\n       {¶21} The DNA collected for the SANE exam was analyzed. There was no\n\nsemen present on the oral, anal, or vaginal swab. However, on the swab of A.S.'s right\n\nbreast, there was DNA of Short and A.S.\n\n       {¶22} Short was released on bond and began living at his mother's house in\n\nLexington, Ohio. He continued to see B.S. Short was divorced from A.S. and he\n\nbecame engaged to B.S. on December 4, 2012.\n\n       CASE NO. 2014-CR-0200 – JANUARY 2013 THROUGH MARCH 2014 – B.S.\n\n       {¶23} In January 2013, Short became violent with B.S. during a sexual encounter\n\nin his vehicle. B.S. was performing oral sex on Short when he struck her in the back of\n\nher head and he grabbed her hair very roughly, stating that she would be bald when he\n\nwas done with her. He eventually threw her glasses out of the vehicle. B.S. did not\n\noriginally report this incident because she loved Short at the time and believed him\n\nwhen he apologized later.\n\n       {¶24} In June 2013, Short again became abusive with B.S. Short requested sex\n\nfrom B.S. and she declined. Short took her glasses and started hitting her. B.S. ran to\n\nthe kitchen and she grabbed what she thought was a knife, but was really an icing\n\nspatula. Short came at her, took the spatula, and began hitting her on the top of the\n\nhead with a closed fist. Short’s mother then came downstairs and told Short to stop.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                       8\n\n\nB.S. fled to a gas station. B.S. did not report this incident because of Short’s pending\n\ncharge involving A.S.\n\n       {¶25} B.S. testified that the abusive relationship with Short grew over time and\n\nshe became more and more afraid of him. She stated that she made three statements\n\nover the pendency of the 2012 case to attempt to assist Short in his defense. Each of\n\nthese statements were at Short’s direction and were made to appease him. These\n\nstatements were largely based solely on what Short told B.S. and were untrue as far as\n\nshe knew.\n\n       {¶26} On March 1, 2014, B.S. was driving to Wal-Mart with Short. Short became\n\nangry with B.S., took out the car keys, and began sawing at her fingers with the keys.\n\nLater that night, while B.S. was staying the night with Short, Short wanted sex from B.S.\n\nand she refused. Short, grabbed her stomach and twisted it painfully. Both then fell\n\nasleep for a short time. About two hours later, Short awakened B.S. demanding sex.\n\nB.S. again refused and Short wrenched B.S.'s legs apart and stated she was his wife\n\nand he could have sex with her whether she wanted to or not. B.S. began crying but\n\ndecided to allow the intercourse. Short went from vaginal sex to penetrating B.S. anally.\n\nWhen he did so, B.S. screamed out in pain. Short covered B.S.'s mouth and began\n\nchoking her to gag her screams so his mother would not hear. Short told B.S. that she\n\nwas dead when he was choking her. Short eventually ejaculated in B.S.'s anus and then\n\nwent to sleep. B.S. lay awake crying, but eventually fell asleep.\n\n       {¶27} The next morning, B.S. wanted to leave but could not find a time to escape.\n\nShort requested sex from B.S. again, which she again denied. Short then proceeded to\n\nhit her on the hip five to seven times, causing injuries to B.S. Short claimed he would\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        9\n\n\nstop hitting B.S. when she is right. Short then went to the bathroom. B.S. took the\n\nopportunity to flee the house. She initially went to the Lexington Police Department, but\n\ndecided not to wait to be helped for fear that Short would find her, so she left.\n\n       {¶28} Short proceeded over the next two days to text and call B.S. He was\n\nbegging B.S. to talk to him and that he was very sorry. B.S. met with Short in public.\n\nShe spoke to Short from her vehicle with the doors locked and the window cracked.\n\nB.S. recorded the conversation with her phone, which was played for the jury. That\n\nconversation had Short apologize profusely and guaranteeing that he will change.\n\n       {¶29} On Monday morning, B.S. went to get a civil protection order, which she\n\nsecured by noon. B.S. then went to Lexington Police Station, met with officers, and\n\nreported the recent incident. B.S. saw a doctor because her organs were tender, and he\n\nnoted some injuries. B.S. was not informed to do a SANE exam until later, which she\n\ncompleted that Wednesday.\n\n       {¶30} At the SANE exam, some bruising was noted and recorded. There was\n\ndiffuse redness on her cervical os and scant bloody drainage noted. Following the\n\nSANE exam, B.S. met with another Lexington Police Officer to report the rape, as they\n\nhad not noticed she complained of both domestic violence and rape previously.\n\n       SHORT TESTIFIES AT TRIAL.\n\n       {¶31} Short testified in this case. He admitted to both of his prior domestic\n\nviolence convictions in 2004 and 2010. Short claimed, regarding the 2012 incident with\n\nA.S., that A.S. let him in the front door and that they had consensual sex after the phone\n\ncall with B.S. During the sex, when they were going to the bedroom, A.S. went to the\n\nglass door, smiled at him mischievously, and left. Smith then drove to his mother's\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                        10\n\n\nhouse. Short denied the allegations of domestic violence and rape that night. Short did\n\nstate that he was scared when he was arrested that night, so he lied in his statement to\n\nofficers.\n\n       {¶32} Short denied the allegations of physical and sexual abuse against B.S.\n\nShort denied that he and B.S. had sex the night of March 1 to March 2, 2014. Short\n\nstated that she smacked B.S.'s thigh playfully on March 2, 2014.\n\n       {¶33} Generally, Short testified at trial that both A.S. and B.S. injured themselves\n\nso that they could create false charges of domestic violence and rape against him.\n\n       SENTENCE.\n\n       {¶34} On July 15, 2014, Short was sentenced in Case No: 2012-CR-0429, to the\n\nOhio State prison system on Count 1 for a mandatory nine years and Count 2, eighteen\n\nmonths. The trial court ordered the sentences to be served consecutive to each other\n\nand also consecutive to his sentence in Case No. 2014-CR-0200. Short was also found\n\nto be a tier three sex offender.\n\n       {¶35} In Case No. 2014-CR-0200, Short was sentenced to the Ohio State prison\n\nsystem on Count 5 for three years, and on Count 6 for 6 months in the Richland County\n\nJail, the Court merged Count 7 with Count 6.\n\n       {¶36} The Court in the Sentencing Entry shows that Counts 5 and 6 are to run\n\nconcurrent to each other. Count 5 is to run consecutively with Case No: 2012-CR-0429\n\nfor a total sentence of thirteen and one-half years in prison. This Sentencing includes\n\nthree years of mandatory post release control.\n\n                                      Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶37} Short raises one assignment of error,\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14CA67                                                          11\n\n\n       {¶38} “I. THE APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS SIXTH AMENDMENT\n\nRIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS THE TRIAL COUNSEL DID\n\nNOT OBJECT TO THE MOTION OF JOINDER FILED BY THE APPELLEE.”\n\n                                             Analysis\n\n       {¶39} In his sole assignment of error, Short argues that his trial counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to object to the state's motion for joinder of Case No. 2012-CR-\n\n0429 involving A.S. that had occurred in 2012 and Case No. 2014-CR-0200 that\n\ninvolved B.S. and had occurred in 2013-2014.\n\n       {¶40} A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a two-prong analysis.\n\nThe first inquiry is whether counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonable representation involving a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's\n\nessential duties to appellant. The second prong is whether the appellant was prejudiced\n\nby counsel's ineffectiveness. Lockhart v.

Because of the severe social stigma\n\nattached to crimes of sexual assault and child molestation, evidence of these past acts\n\nposes a higher risk, on the whole, of influencing the jury to punish the defendant for the\n\nsimilar act rather than the charged act.
