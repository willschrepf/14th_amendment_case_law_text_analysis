Petitioner challenges only his capital sentence; he\ndoes not challenge his underlying felony murder conviction,\narising from his role in a car-jacking.1 Petitioner argues that\n\n\n\n\n  1\n    Petitioner briefed several additional issues that the district court\ndeclined to certify for appeal. Most of those issues relate to sentencing, but\none challenges the conviction. We have examined all the uncertified\nissues, and none meets the standard for granting a certificate of appeala-\nbility. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003) (stating that a\n\f                             MILES v. RYAN                             9801\nhis counsel was ineffective at sentencing because she failed to\nfocus on Petitioner’s drug addiction (rather than on intoxica-\ntion), enlisted an unqualified expert, and failed to investigate\nPetitioner’s social history thoroughly enough.\n\n  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and\n2253, and we affirm.\n\n         FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n  A.    The Crime\n\n   On an afternoon late in 1992, Petitioner was standing on a\nstreet corner in Tucson, Arizona, with Levi Jackson and Ray\nHernandez. Jackson was carrying a pistol that the three of\nthem had just obtained together; he had told Petitioner and\nHernandez of his plan to commit a car-jacking. Specifically,\naccording to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement to the police,\nJackson had told them that he was “gonna get somebody’s\ncar, take ‘em off in the middle of the desert, and shoot ‘em.”\nAt the time, Jackson and Hernandez were both 16 years old.\nPetitioner was 24 years old.\n\n   When Patricia Baeuerlen drove up and stopped at the cor-\nner, Jackson approached her car and asked for “a light.” When\nshe turned to reach her cigarette lighter, Jackson pointed the\nweapon at her and told her to move over. He unlocked the car\nto allow Petitioner and Hernandez to enter and sit in the rear.\nWhile Jackson drove the car out to the desert, Hernandez held\nthe pistol, but Petitioner also held it at some point. They drove\nBaeuerlen out of the city, into the desert, and stopped at a dirt\n\ncourt should grant a certificate of appealability only when a habeas peti-\ntioner has demonstrated “that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or,\nfor that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a dif-\nferent manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve\nencouragement to proceed further” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f9802                     MILES v. RYAN\nroad. There, Jackson told Baeuerlen to get out of the car and\ntake off her shoes and jacket. She obeyed. After taunting and\nharassing Baeuerlen for five to ten minutes, Jackson suddenly\nshot her in the chest. Baeuerlen died as a result of the gunshot.\nAccording to testimony presented at trial and sentencing,\nJackson—not Petitioner—shot Baeuerlen as he and Petitioner\nwere walking away from Baeuerlen and returning to the car.\nThroughout the ordeal, starting with the drive to the desert,\nBaeuerlen was pleading for her life.\n\n   After the shooting, Jackson, Petitioner, and Hernandez\ndrove away. According to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement,\nhe thought that Baeuerlen was still alive when they left her in\nthe desert. No one sought help for Baeuerlen. Later the same\nday, Petitioner used Baeuerlen’s ATM card, and a PIN that he\nhad found in her belongings, to take money out of her bank\naccount. The next day, Petitioner drove Baeuerlen’s car to\nPhoenix, where he went shopping at malls, exchanged\nBaeuerlen’s children’s Christmas presents for other goods,\nand went drinking with old friends. Petitioner told those\nfriends about the murder, insisting that he did not pull the trig-\nger, but smiling and laughing as he related the events.\n\n  B.   Arrest and Interrogation\n\n   In the early hours of the following morning, that is, the sec-\nond day after the murder, police arrested Petitioner in Chan-\ndler, Arizona, following a high-speed chase in Baeuerlen’s\ncar. The police found Baeuerlen’s ATM card, credit card,\njewelry, and other personal items in his possession. Later that\nmorning, Tucson detectives began a tape-recorded interroga-\ntion that lasted about five hours. During the interrogation,\nPetitioner initially explained his possession of the car by tell-\ning the detectives two different stories, neither of which\nplaced him at the scene of the murder. But, after several hours\nof interrogation, Petitioner admitted to his involvement in the\nmurder. Specifically, he admitted to knowing of Jackson’s\nplan to car-jack and shoot someone, to participating in obtain-\n\f                            MILES v. RYAN                  9803\ning the pistol with Jackson and Hernandez, to holding the\nweapon at some point during the drive out to the desert, and\nto watching Jackson shoot Baeuerlen.\n\n  C.    Trial and Sentencing\n\n   Soon after Petitioner’s arrest, Barbara Sattler was appointed\nas his counsel and represented him through trial and sentenc-\ning. After a jury convicted Petitioner of first-degree felony\nmurder, dangerous kidnapping, and dangerous armed robbery,2\nthe trial court reviewed a pre-sentence report (“PSR”) and\nheld a sentencing hearing.\n\n  The PSR states that the crime occurred at around 1:30 p.m.\nand that Petitioner reported having used crack cocaine “four\nor five hours earlier” and not having slept the night before.\nThe PSR also contains statements from Petitioner that he\nexpected to get money from the car-jacking and that he\nwanted to commit another robbery with the pistol. The PSR\nrepeats Petitioner’s assertions that he did not believe that\nJackson would kill Baeuerlen and that Petitioner thought that\nJackson would have killed him if he had tried to stop the mur-\nder.\n\n   The social history section of the PSR contains the follow-\ning information. Petitioner was adopted at the age of 4\nmonths. His adoptive mother was an alcoholic who neverthe-\nless maintained employment, eventually rising past jobs as a\nwaitress and cook to become a nursing home administrator.\nAlthough Petitioner is black, his adoptive mother was white,\nwhich caused some degree of social problems; those problems\ngrew worse when Petitioner and his mother moved to a more\naffluent neighborhood. Petitioner found a way to fit in by\nbecoming a “class clown” and by playing basketball. Indeed,\ndespite poor grades, he graduated from high school and won\na basketball scholarship to a Bible college, but he dropped out\n  2\n   As noted, none of these convictions is at issue here.\n\f9804                         MILES v. RYAN\nof college after only a week. Petitioner later served in the\nNavy, where he was disciplined for substance abuse and\nassault before receiving an other-than-honorable discharge.\nHe also married and had a child, though he later grew apart\nfrom his wife and began using drugs. His wife eventually left\nhim, leading him to be evicted from their apartment. A month\nlater, his mother died, and his drug habit grew worse.\n\n   At the sentencing hearing, Sattler called an expert, Dr. Mar-\ntin Levy, Ph.D., to discuss Petitioner’s drug use. Dr. Levy is\na clinical psychologist who had evaluated Petitioner during a\ntwo-hour session. Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner reported\nusing crack cocaine the night before the car-jacking. In partic-\nular, Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner’s “mental state was\ncompromised by intoxication . . . with cocaine.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Dr. Levy also testified that Petitioner’s description of\nhis mental state during the crime suggested a state of “disasso-\nciat[ion],”3 which was consistent with Petitioner’s reported\ndrug use.\n\n   The prosecutor objected to Dr. Levy’s testimony on the\nground that it lacked foundation. The sentencing judge agreed\nand determined that, because Dr. Levy had insufficient\nknowledge of when and in what quantities Petitioner used\ndrugs, he could not testify with specificity as to Petitioner’s\nlevel of impairment or judgment at the time of the crime.\nNevertheless, in Sattler’s closing argument, she reiterated her\nposition that Petitioner was “under the influence of drugs and\nalcohol that day.”\n\n   Sattler focused only briefly on Petitioner’s social history at\n  3\n    Dr. Levy’s testimony and reports use the terms “disassociation” and\n“dissociation” interchangeably. “Dissociation” is a “[s]eparation of psy-\nchologic experiences and events that are normally related, leading to a dis-\ntortion of experience and of the meaning of personal and interpersonal\nevents.” Robert J. Campbell, M.D., Campbell’s Psychiatric Dictionary\n289 (9th ed. 2009).\n\f                               MILES v. RYAN                              9805\nsentencing. Two character witnesses testified about his back-\nground and his nonviolent nature.4 Indeed, Sattler’s closing\narguments characterize him as a relatively normal person—\none who graduated from high school, who usually maintained\ngainful employment, who served in the military and com-\npleted most of his term of service, who married, and who had\na child—but who made some mistakes after his wife left and\nhis mother died.\n\n   Ultimately, the trial judge sentenced Petitioner to death by\nlethal injection.5 In so doing, the trial judge cited three aggra-\nvating factors:6 (1) that Petitioner had previous convictions for\nthree separate crimes of violence (armed robberies), (2) that\nPetitioner committed the car-jacking in pursuit of pecuniary\ngain, and (3) that the murder was committed in an especially\ncruel manner.7 The trial court also noted that the murder was\nsenseless, in that it was unnecessary to the escape of Peti-\ntioner and his accomplices.\n  4\n     In addition, Sattler planned to call Petitioner’s estranged wife to testify\nbut did not do so because Petitioner had objected. Similarly, she planned\nto call two other character and background witnesses, but they were\nunavailable because of a medical emergency. At sentencing, Sattler made\na statement on the record to document those circumstances.\n   5\n     The conviction, sentencing, and appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court\nall took place before the Supreme Court decided Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S.\n584 (2002), which requires a jury to determine all facts relating to eligibil-\nity for capital punishment. Ring “does not apply retroactively to cases\nalready final on direct review.” Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 358\n(2004).\n   6\n     The trial judge relied on an additional aggravating factor—that the\nmurder was committed in an especially heinous manner—but the Arizona\nSupreme Court reversed on that point. See State v. Miles, 918 P.2d 1028,\n1035-36 (Ariz. 1996).\n   7\n     To support the cruelty finding, the trial judge found that Baeuerlen\n“suffered prolonged mental anguish and uncertainty as to her fate,” as\ndemonstrated by Petitioner’s own account of her “crying, screaming in ter-\nror, and begging for her life.”\n\f9806                         MILES v. RYAN\n   In mitigation, the trial judge rejected most of the potential\nmitigating factors. He rejected the contention that Petitioner\nwas only a minor participant in the crime. The trial judge also\nrejected unforeseeability8 of the murder and Petitioner’s age\nas mitigating factors. As to expressions of remorse, the trial\njudge found them insincere and, in any event, outweighed by\nthe aggravating factors listed above:\n\n      The court finds that the defendant’s expression of\n      remorse was insufficient to outweigh the aggravating\n      circumstances of this case. No remorse was evi-\n      denced when the defendant went to Phoenix, after\n      the murder, in the car of Miss Baeuerlen, to party\n      with his friends. No remorse was evidenced when\n      the defendant was captured by the Phoenix Police.\n      No remorse was evidenced when the defendant, a\n      day after the murder, was able [to] laugh when\n      detailing the murder . . . to a boyhood friend in Phoe-\n      nix.\n\n   The trial judge rejected the possibility of rehabilitation,\nfinding no evidence to support it. He went on to note that,\neven if he were to find a possibility of rehabilitation, that\nwould not outweigh the aggravating factors. The trial judge\nalso found that Petitioner’s cooperation with the police was\npurely self-interested and not sufficient “to establish a miti-\ngating circumstance or to outweigh the aggravating circum-\nstances.”\n\n   The trial judge did consider mitigation arising from the\nnature of the murder conviction—felony murder, rather than\npre-meditated murder—but found it insufficient to outweigh\nthe aggravating factors. The trial judge also considered Peti-\n  8\n    The trial judge went on to note that Petitioner could not have been sur-\nprised by the killing in view of his accomplice’s statement, before the\ncrime, that he was “gonna get somebody’s car, take ‘em off in the middle\nof the desert, and shoot ‘em.”\n\f                        MILES v. RYAN                          9807\ntioner’s reputation for nonviolence but did not find it suffi-\ncient to outweigh the aggravating factors, especially in view\nof Petitioner’s recent commission of three armed robberies.\n\n  Finally, of particular significance to this appeal, the trial\njudge rejected any drug-related mitigation, stating:\n\n    The court finds that there is no credible evidence that\n    the defendant’s capacity was impaired or that drugs\n    or alcohol had impaired the defendant’s thinking or\n    actions at the time of the crimes in question. . . . The\n    testimony offered by the defendant, from Doctor\n    Levy, Ph.D., as to impairment, was without adequate\n    foundation, and considered by the court to be with-\n    out value.\n\n  D.   Post-Conviction Relief Proceedings\n\n   On direct appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the\nconviction and capital sentence. State v. Miles, 918 P.2d 1028\n(Ariz. 1996). Petitioner did not petition for certiorari to the\nUnited States Supreme Court, but he did file a state court peti-\ntion for post-conviction relief (“PCR”) under Rule 32 of the\nArizona Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Arizona Superior\nCourt denied Petitioner’s PCR petition, rejecting his ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel claims on the merits. With respect\nto Sattler’s failure to focus on addiction, the state court con-\ncluded both that Sattler’s performance was not deficient and\nthat Petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice. With respect to\nthe other two claims in this case, the state court concluded\nonly that Sattler’s performance was not deficient—it made no\ndetermination as to prejudice. The Arizona Supreme Court\ndenied the petition for review of the PCR decision.\n\n   Before denying Petitioner’s PCR petition, the Arizona\nSuperior Court, however, ordered an evidentiary hearing. In\npreparation for that hearing, Petitioner underwent more exten-\nsive psychological testing. Dr. Joseph Geffen, Ph.D., a clini-\n\f9808                    MILES v. RYAN\ncal psychologist, prepared a report describing Petitioner as\nusing drugs to “self-medicat[e]” and as having resorted to\ncrime because of “his perceived need for drugs without which\nhe cannot cope.” Dr. Levy had described Petitioner’s drug use\nsimilarly, as self-medication, in his pre-sentence evaluation,\nbut did not connect Petitioner’s motivation for his crimes to\na need to acquire drugs.\n\n   In preparation for the state hearing, Petitioner’s counsel\nhired an investigator to probe further into his social history.\nThe investigator produced a detailed report, containing infor-\nmation gleaned from interviews with many people who knew\nPetitioner and his mother during his youth. The additional his-\ntory confirms that Petitioner’s mother was an alcoholic and\nsuggests that she may also have used heroin, or at least social-\nized with those who did. The investigation revealed that his\nmother worked as a prostitute and perhaps ran her own\nwhorehouse out of her home. When Petitioner was approxi-\nmately 11 years old, his mother began work at a nursing home\n(and may have given up prostitution); there, she rose to\nbecome an administrator, a position she held until Petitioner’s\nlast year of high school, when she was fired for drinking on\nthe job. Additionally, the report characterized Petitioner’s\nhometown of Winslow, Arizona, as being segregated, corrupt,\nand rife with prostitution, crime, drugs, and gambling. The\ninvestigation confirmed that Petitioner and his mother suf-\nfered at least some alienation due to their mixed-race house-\nhold.\n\n   The additional social history also suggests that Petitioner’s\nmother was an “extremely protective mother” who made him\nthe center of her life. She was “infatuated” with her son and\n“coddle[d]” him. She slept in the same bed as Petitioner until\nhe was 14 years old. She “read to him constantly and sang to\nhim when she fed him,” past an age considered “normal” by\na friend. The additional social history reveals that, although\nPetitioner’s mother disciplined him by spanking him with a\nhairbrush when he was 4 or 5 years old, she later discontinued\n\f                              MILES v. RYAN                             9809\nthe practice and did not physically abuse him.9 She bought\nPetitioner “everything he wanted” and, when he developed\nbuck teeth, for which other children teased him, she arranged\nfor him to get braces.\n\n   The additional social history report went on to discuss Peti-\ntioner’s relationships with his community. He went to church\ntwice a week for Bible study until at least his junior high\nschool years, receiving a ride from a local bus ministry. When\nhe was in junior high school, his basketball coach frequently\ndrove him home from practices. He became good friends with\na local family, spending a great deal of time at their home;\nindeed, they treated him like their own child. Notably, he\nremained in contact with members of that family well into\nadulthood—two of them were character witnesses at his sen-\ntencing hearing. According to those two witnesses, Petitioner\nstayed in touch with them after leaving Winslow and visited\nthem to introduce his wife. One of the witnesses was a close\nfriend when she and Petitioner were both living in Tucson;\nshe was present for the birth of his daughter.\n\n  The additional social history investigation also looked into\nPetitioner’s high school years, during which he played on the\nbasketball team and earned a varsity letter in his senior year,\nhelping to win the state championship. He had a close-knit\ngroup of five friends, and he was popular with girls.\n  9\n    Petitioner now disputes this finding and recently filed an affidavit stat-\ning that his mother routinely physically abused him when he was between\nthe ages of 4 and 14 years old by beating him with “belts, extension cords,\npaddles, switches, and her fists.” Because this evidence was not before the\nstate court, however, we may not consider it. See Cullen v. Pinholster, 131\nS. Ct. 1388, 1398 (2011) (holding that “review under [28 U.S.C.]\n§ 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits”).\n\f9810                     MILES v. RYAN\n  E.   Federal Habeas Proceedings\n\n   In late 2001, Petitioner filed this habeas corpus petition\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. The district court granted Peti-\ntioner’s request for appointment of an investigator and a doc-\ntor, and the court later granted requests for more funds for\nmitigation specialists.\n\n   Under the district court’s order, Dr. Geffen, who had exam-\nined Petitioner during the state post-conviction proceedings,\nexamined him again and prepared another report. In his\nreport, Dr. Geffen stated that, after learning about “modern\nmethods of evaluating mitigation factors in death penalty\ncases,” years after his initial evaluation of Petitioner, he\nthought that he “had not done as complete an evaluation as\npossible.” Dr. Geffen further concluded: (1) that Petitioner\nwas “experiencing an altered state of mind at the time of\n[Baeuerlen’s] murder;” (2) that, “[a]lthough physically pres-\nent, [Petitioner] was emotionally and mentally ‘not there’ in\nterms of his awareness and appreciation of events around him,\ndue to a dissociative state of mind, during which the event\nappeared to him as unreal and disconnected from him;” (3)\nthat Petitioner’s “substance abuse at the time was part of a\nlifelong adjustment problem which resulted in a severe state\nof depression, and that the drugs served the purpose of numb-\ning his perceptions after some catastrophic losses and per-\nsonal failures, including the loss of his mother and of his\nmarriage and family and job, almost simultaneously, rather\nthan being an isolated recreational act;” and (4) that Petition-\ner’s “altered mental state met the criteria for statutory mitiga-\ntion, since he was not capable of conforming to the lawful\nrequirements due to his impaired mental state.”\n\n   Around the same time, Petitioner was also examined by Dr.\nWm. Michael Cochran, M.D. Dr. Cochran concluded that, “at\nthe time of his participation in the crime(s) on December 7,\n1992, [Petitioner] was using alcohol, crack cocaine and mari-\njuana addictively” and that Petitioner’s “participation in the\n\f                           MILES v. RYAN                         9811\nrobbery of [ ] Baeuerlen was primarily motivated by his\naddictions, and their consequent monetary obligations to sat-\nisfy the attendant ‘needs’ for continued use.”10\n\n   In 2004, the district court granted, in part, Petitioner’s\nmotion for an evidentiary hearing by allowing depositions of\nSattler and Phyllis Howell (Sattler’s trial investigator). But\nthe district court ultimately determined that an evidentiary\nhearing was “neither warranted nor required because Peti-\ntioner ha[d] not alleged facts which, if proved, would entitle\nhim to relief.” The district court then denied Petitioner’s peti-\ntion, certifying only the issues discussed in this opinion. Peti-\ntioner timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 2253. After oral argument and submission of the\ncase, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Martinez v.\nRyan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012), and we ordered supplemental\nbriefing to address the effect, if any, of Martinez on the certi-\nfied issues in this case.\n\n                  STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n  We review de novo a district court’s denial of habeas cor-\npus relief. Robinson v. Ignacio, 360 F.3d 1044, 1055 (9th Cir.\n2004).\n\n   Our review of the underlying state court decisions, on the\nother hand, is more limited. Because Petitioner filed his\n§ 2254 habeas petition after April 24, 1996, his petition is\ngoverned by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat.\n1214. Lambert v. Blodgett, 393 F.3d 943, 965 (9th Cir. 2004).\nUnder AEDPA, we must defer to a state court’s decision with\nrespect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits unless\nthe adjudication of the claim:\n  10\n     After Pinholster, the AEDPA standard of review prevents us from\nrelying on Dr. Cochran’s report or Dr. Geffen’s last report because the\nstate court did not consider that evidence.\n\f9812                     MILES v. RYAN\n       (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n    established Federal law, as determined by the\n    Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n       (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an\n    unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n    the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n   Under § 2254(d)(1), a state court’s decision involves an\n“unreasonable application” of clearly established federal law\nif it “identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the\nSupreme Court’s] decisions but unreasonably applies that\nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner’s case.” Holland v. Jack-\nson, 542 U.S. 649, 652 (2004) (per curiam) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n                        DISCUSSION\n\n   When applying AEDPA’s standards, we review the “last\nreasoned decision” by a state court addressing the issue at\nhand. Robinson, 360 F.3d at 1055 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Here, the last reasoned opinion addressing the\nclaims presently before us—whether counsel performed inef-\nfectively at sentencing—is the Arizona Superior Court’s Min-\nute Entry, which denied Petitioner’s PCR petition.\n\n   Clearly established Supreme Court precedent provides a\nframework for examining Sixth Amendment ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel claims. See Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668 (1984). To establish ineffective assistance of counsel\nunder Strickland, a prisoner must demonstrate both: (1) that\ncounsel’s performance was deficient, and (2) that the defi-\ncient performance prejudiced his defense. Id. at 688-93. We\nmay address these prongs in whichever order we deem most\nefficient. Id. at 697.\n\f                              MILES v. RYAN                             9813\n   The first prong of the Strickland—test—deficient\nperformance—requires a showing that counsel’s performance\n“fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,” id. at\n688, or was “outside the wide range of professionally compe-\ntent assistance,” id. at 690. The test is “highly deferential,”\nevaluating the challenged conduct from counsel’s perspective\nat the time in issue. Id. at 689. This inquiry should “begin\nwith the premise that ‘under the circumstances, the challenged\naction[s] might be considered sound trial strategy.’ ” Cullen\nv. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 1404 (2011) (alteration in orig-\ninal) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689), rev’g Pinholster\nv. Ayers, 590 F.3d 651 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). Under this\nobjective approach, we are required “to affirmatively enter-\ntain” the range of possible reasons counsel might have pro-\nceeded as he or she did. Id. at 1407.\n\n   The second prong of the Strickland test—prejudice—\nrequires the petitioner to demonstrate a “reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe [trial] would have been different.” 466 U.S. at 694. “A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\nconfidence in the outcome.” Id. Further, as with any claim of\nconstitutional error in a federal habeas case applied to state\nprisoners, an additional, essentially overlapping, harmless\nerror standard applies: “whether the constitutional error ‘had\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\n[outcome].’ ” Ybarra v. McDaniel, 656 F.3d 984, 995 (9th\nCir. 2011) (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637\n(1993)), petition for cert. filed, ___ U.S.L.W. ___ (U.S. May\n29, 2012) (No. 11-10652).\n\n  The state court applied Strickland—the correct rule—in\nanalyzing Petitioner’s claims.11 On habeas review, Petitioner’s\n   11\n      The state court identified the Strickland legal standard without citing\nthat particular case; rather, the state court cited only Arizona Supreme\nCourt decisions. But those state court decisions, in turn, explicitly cite and\nadopt Strickland. See State v. Vickers, 885 P.2d 1086, 1090 (Ariz. 1994);\nState v. Nash, 694 P.2d 222, 227 (Ariz. 1985).\n\f9814                        MILES v. RYAN\nclaims amount to a contention that the state court misapplied\nStrickland, so those claims fall squarely under § 2254(d)(1).\nSee Knowles v. Mirzayance, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 1414-15 (2009)\n(evaluating an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under\n§ 2254(d)(1)); Cheney v. Washington, 614 F.3d 987, 990 (9th\nCir. 2010) (same).\n\n   Our review of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nunder § 2254(d)(1) and Strickland is “doubly deferential.”\nKnowles, 129 S. Ct. at 1420. The issue “is not whether [we]\nbelieve[ ] the state court’s determination under the Strickland\nstandard was incorrect but whether that determination was\nunreasonable—a substantially higher threshold.” Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n   With that framework in mind, we evaluate Petitioner’s\nclaims.\n\n  A.    Addiction as a Mitigating Factor\n\n  [1] Petitioner first argues that, during sentencing, Sattler\nunreasonably failed to focus on his drug addiction. We dis-\nagree. Sattler’s decision to rely on Dr. Levy and to focus on\nother mitigating factors, such as depression, rather than on\naddiction, was a matter of strategy.12 Sattler’s arguments at\nsentencing support our conclusion. Her chosen tack—\ncharacterizing Petitioner as a relatively normal person who\nwas suffering from depression—evinces a desire to avoid\npainting Petitioner as a drug addict. At the very least, Sattler’s\nargument at sentencing raises the possibility that she was\nmotivated by such a strategy, which is all that Pinholster\nrequires. 131 S. Ct. at 1404-07. Because Sattler’s decision not\n  12\n    Sattler’s deposition supports our conclusion, but after Pinholster, we\nmay not consider that evidence under the AEDPA standard of review. 131\nS. Ct. at 1400 (“[E]vidence introduced in federal court has no bearing on\n§ 2254(d)(1) review.”). Accordingly, we do not rely on Sattler’s deposi-\ntion.\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                      9815\nto focus on drug addiction appears to have been motivated by\nreasonable strategic concerns, that decision is deserving of\ngreat deference under Strickland and Pinholster. See Turner\nv. Calderon, 281 F.3d 851, 876 (9th Cir. 2002) (“The choice\nof what type of expert to use is one of trial strategy and\ndeserves ‘a heavy measure of deference.’ ” (quoting Strick-\nland’s statement regarding deference due to counsel’s investi-\ngative decisions, 466 U.S. at 691)).\n\n   [2] Petitioner also argues that Sattler’s representation was\ndeficient because her sentencing arguments discussed intoxi-\ncation rather than addiction. Sattler’s decision to avoid assert-\ning that Petitioner suffered from an addiction, while focusing\ninstead on lingering intoxication from the use of crack\ncocaine, could be seen as inconsistent with a strategy of paint-\ning Petitioner as a normal person; if counsel thought that drug\nuse made Petitioner appear less deserving of sympathy, one\nmight think that she would have tried to avoid mentioning\ndrugs at all. But counsel’s strategy and decision are reason-\nable when viewed from her perspective at the time of trial, as\nStrickland requires us to do. Petitioner discussed his crack\ncocaine use in his confession, and it was mentioned in the\nPSR, so Sattler had to address it somehow.\n\n   [3] Moreover, Petitioner was sentenced in 1993. As\nrecently as 1998, the Arizona Supreme Court was routinely\nrejecting addiction as a mitigating factor unless the defendant\ncould show intoxication at the time of the crime. See, e.g.,\nState v. Greene, 967 P.2d 106, 117 (Ariz. 1998) (“To hold\nthat a motivation to kill fueled in part by a desire for drugs is\nmitigating would be anomalous indeed.”); State v. Williams,\n904 P.2d 437, 453 (Ariz. 1995) (“Without a showing of some\nimpairment at the time of the offense, drug use cannot be a\nmitigating circumstance of any kind.” (citing State v. White,\n815 P.2d 869, 882 (Ariz. 1991))); State v. Wood, 881 P.2d\n1158, 1176 (Ariz. 1994) (“We further believe Defendant’s\nimpulsive personality and history of substance abuse merit lit-\ntle, if any, independent consideration in mitigation. As noted,\n\f9816                         MILES v. RYAN\nDefendant was not under the influence of any intoxicating\nsubstance at the time of the murders.” (emphasis added) (cit-\ning State v. Bible, 858 P.2d 1152, 1209 (Ariz. 1993))). But see\nState v. Gallegos, 870 P.2d 1097, 1113-15 (Ariz. 1994) (find-\ning error in trial court’s failure to consider history of sub-\nstance abuse as a nonstatutory mitigating factor). For that\nreason, too, counsel would have had to emphasize intoxica-\ntion.\n\n   [4] It was only recently, in 2010, that we disapproved the\nArizona Supreme Court’s treatment of addiction, in a habeas\nreview of Williams, 904 P.2d 437. Williams v. Ryan, 623 F.3d\n1258, 1270 (9th Cir. 2010). Given the state of Arizona law at\nthe time of trial, Sattler would have been operating under the\nassumption that intoxication was the only viable means of\nexplaining Petitioner’s drug use to the sentencing judge. And\nthe evidence did not rule out some sort of lingering\nintoxication—Dr. Levy discussed it in his report.13 Seen from\nthis perspective, Sattler’s strategy did not fall outside the wide\nrange of professional competence or below an objective stan-\ndard of reasonableness.14\n\n  [5] Even if Sattler had been deficient in failing to focus on\naddiction, we see no prejudice, the second prong of the Strick-\n  13\n      Dr. Levy’s report discusses Petitioner’s condition at the time of the\ncrime as “coming down” from crack cocaine use the previous night and\nnotes that Petitioner was dissociated from the events. At trial, Dr. Levy\ntestified that this state is common among drug users.\n   14\n      To be sure, in Williams, we wrote: “The decision of the Arizona\nSupreme Court that drug use could not be considered as a mitigating factor\n‘of any kind,’ is contrary to the Supreme Court’s consistent decisions in\ncapital cases beginning more than a decade before Williams’ [1992]\ntrial.” 623 F.3d at 1270 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, as Petitioner’s\nbrief acknowledges, under Arizona law at the time of his trial, addiction\nwas not a recognized form of mitigation. Thus, although she could have\nrelied on existing United States Supreme Court decisions to challenge the\nArizona practice of ignoring the mitigating value of addiction, her strategy\nmerits deference under Strickland.\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                       9817\nland standard. In assessing prejudice, we consider the mitigat-\ning effect of Petitioner’s drug addiction and how it would\nhave altered the balancing of aggravating and mitigating fac-\ntors discussed at sentencing. See Porter v. McCollum, 130 S.\nCt. 447, 453-54 (2009) (per curiam) (“To assess th[e] proba-\nbility [of a different sentence], we consider the totality of the\navailable mitigation evidence—both that adduced at trial, and\nthe evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding—and reweigh\nit against the evidence in aggravation.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) (brackets omitted)).\n\n   [6] As noted above, Petitioner’s case involved significant\naggravating factors, none of which would be affected by\naddiction. For many of the proposed mitigating factors\n(remorse, rehabilitation, cooperation), the trial judge made\ntwo findings—(1) that the evidence was insufficient to estab-\nlish the mitigating factor in the first place; and (2) that even\nif the mitigating factor were established, it would be insuffi-\ncient to outweigh the aggravating factors. It is highly unlikely\nthat a finding of addiction as a mitigating factor would have\ntipped the scales where none of the other proposed mitigators\ndid. Indeed, addiction could be characterized as merely\nanother element of social history, which the sentencing judge\nconsidered and found insufficient to outweigh the aggrava-\ntors. As stated by the district court:\n\n    The sentencing judge considered Petitioner’s life cir-\n    cumstances but found them insufficient to warrant\n    leniency. There is no reasonable probability that\n    focusing on Petitioner’s crack cocaine addiction, as\n    opposed to the reasons that led to the addiction,\n    would have changed the sentencing outcome.\n\n  [7] Under AEDPA, the state court’s decision denying this\nportion of Petitioner’s ineffective assistance claim must stand.\nThe state court did not apply Strickland unreasonably. See\nHarrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 785 (2011) (“A state\ncourt must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in\n\f9818                    MILES v. RYAN\noperation when the case involves review under the Strickland\nstandard itself.”); cf. id. at 789 (“Rare are the situations in\nwhich the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical\ndecisions will be limited to any one technique or approach. It\ncan be assumed that in some cases counsel would be deemed\nineffective for failing to consult or rely on experts, but even\nthat formulation is sufficiently general that state courts would\nhave wide latitude in applying it.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n   “Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy task.”\nId. at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Sat-\ntler’s decision not to focus on addiction as a mitigating factor\nwas strategic and because Petitioner was not prejudiced as a\nresult, he fails to meet the Strickland standard here.\n\n  B.   Qualifications of Expert\n\n   Petitioner next argues that Sattler’s preparation of Dr. Levy\nwas deficient. The sentencing court did not allow Dr. Levy to\ntestify as to Petitioner’s drug use because of a lack of\nfoundation—Dr. Levy did not know how often Petitioner had\nbeen using drugs, or in what quantities. He did not even know\nif, or for how long, Petitioner had slept between the time he\ningested drugs and the time he committed the crime.\n\n   Although Sattler’s strategy—to focus on intoxication rather\nthan addiction—was reasonable, she may have failed to\nimplement it appropriately. But even if that failure represents\nperformance so deficient as to meet the standards applicable\nwhen we review a Strickland claim under AEDPA—a ques-\ntion we do not decide—Petitioner still fails to demonstrate\nprejudice. On this point, the state court made no determina-\ntion on the merits, so we must review de novo. See Porter,\n130 S. Ct. at 452 (“Because the state court did not decide\nwhether Porter’s counsel was deficient, we review this ele-\nment of Porter’s Strickland claim de novo.”). Significantly,\nthe sentencing judge was aware of Petitioner’s drug use—the\n\f                           MILES v. RYAN                        9819\nPSR, which quoted some of Dr. Levy’s opinions, contained\ninformation about Petitioner’s “coming down” from crack\ncocaine used the night before the crime, as well as a diagnosis\nthat Petitioner was in a “disassociated” state. The excluded\ntestimony would have added very little more.\n\n   Furthermore, as the district court noted, even if Dr. Levy\ncould have testified as to the effect of Petitioner’s drug use on\nhis mental state, that testimony would have been of limited\nvalue in view of: (1) Petitioner’s “acknowledgment that he\nwas not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of\nthe offense”; and (2) Dr. Levy’s other testimony that “regard-\nless of his drug abuse Petitioner knew the difference between\nright and wrong and was capable of walking away from the\noffense, thus negating any finding of significant impairment\nunder A.R.S. § 13-703(G)(1).”15 It is not reasonably probable\nthat Dr. Levy’s excluded testimony would have influenced the\nsentencing judge because, even if the judge had considered\nPetitioner’s drug use to be a form of reduced, nonstatutory\nintoxication, the mitigating effect of that condition would\nhave been insufficient to outweigh the aggravating factors\noutlined and discussed above. Consequently, Petitioner’s inef-\nfective assistance of counsel claim, regarding the qualifica-\ntions of Dr. Levy, fails on the prejudice prong of Strickland,\nreviewed de novo.\n\n  C.   Investigation of Social History\n\n   [8] Finally, Petitioner argues that Sattler’s performance\nwas deficient because she failed to investigate mitigating cir-\ncumstances thoroughly enough. Strickland itself involved a\nclaim of ineffective assistance for failure to investigate miti-\ngating circumstances. For that reason, Strickland is an espe-\ncially good starting point for analyzing Petitioner’s claim that\nSattler failed to investigate sufficiently his social history. The\n  15\n    Section 13-703 (1993) has since been renumbered as Arizona Revised\nStatutes section 13-751 (2011).\n\f9820                     MILES v. RYAN\nSupreme Court outlined the standards governing counsel’s\nduty to investigate as follows:\n\n    [S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation\n    of law and facts relevant to plausible options are vir-\n    tually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made\n    after less than complete investigation are reasonable\n    precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n    judgments support the limitations on investigation.\n    In other words, counsel has a duty to make reason-\n    able investigations or to make a reasonable decision\n    that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In\n    any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to\n    investigate must be directly assessed for reasonable-\n    ness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy mea-\n    sure of deference to counsel’s judgments.\n\n    . . . And when a defendant has given counsel reason\n    to believe that pursuing certain investigations would\n    be fruitless or even harmful, counsel’s failure to pur-\n    sue those investigations may not later be challenged\n    as unreasonable.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91 (emphasis added).\n\n   In Pinholster, the Supreme Court provided more guidance,\noverturning an opinion in which we had drawn, from other\nrecent Supreme Court cases, a “constitutional duty to investi-\ngate, and the principle that it is prima facie ineffective assis-\ntance for counsel to abandon their investigation of the\npetitioner’s background after having acquired only rudimen-\ntary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.”\n131 S. Ct. at 1406 (citation, internal quotation marks, and\nbrackets omitted). In the decision that Pinholster reversed, we\nhad explained that we “could not ‘lightly disregard’ a failure\nto introduce evidence of ‘excruciating life history’ or ‘night-\nmarish childhood.’ ” Id. (quoting Pinholster, 590 F.3d at 684).\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                         9821\n  In reversing us, the Court in Pinholster explained Strick-\nland:\n\n    “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s con-\n    duct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of\n    circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range\n    of legitimate decisions . . . .” Strickland itself\n    rejected the notion that the same investigation will\n    be required in every case. It is “[r]are” that constitu-\n    tionally competent representation will require “any\n    one technique or approach.”\n\nId. at 1406-07 (alteration in original) (citations omitted)\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688-89, 691, and Richter, 131\nS. Ct. at 788-89).\n\n   Here, Sattler’s actions are a reasonable implementation of\nher strategy—made explicit in her closing arguments at\nsentencing—to characterize Petitioner as a relatively normal\nperson who made serious mistakes after his wife left and his\nmother died. Cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 672-74 (finding that\ncounsel’s strategy—claiming “no significant history of crimi-\nnal activity” and arguing that the defendant “should be spared\ndeath . . . because [he] was fundamentally a good person who\nhad briefly gone badly wrong in extremely stressful circum-\nstances” arising from “his inability to support his family”—\nwas professionally reasonable, justifying a failure to investi-\ngate and present background information that might under-\nmine those claims).\n\n   [9] Sattler’s failure to investigate more thoroughly is justi-\nfied, then, by the irrelevance of additional social history to her\nchosen strategy. As Pinholster recognized, choice of a partic-\nular strategy can make “particular investigations unneces-\nsary.” 131 S. Ct. at 1407; see id. at 1407-08 (approving of the\nnotion that “ “‘humanizing” the defendant . . . may be the\nwrong tactic in some cases because experienced lawyers con-\nclude that the [sentencing authority] simply won’t buy it’ ”\n\f9822                    MILES v. RYAN\n(quoting Pinholster, 590 F.3d at 692 (Kozinski, C.J., dissent-\ning)).\n\n   [10] Because Sattler’s actions reflect a deliberate choice of\nreasonable strategy, they do not fall outside reasonable pro-\nfessional norms. We see no deficient performance in Sattler’s\ndecision not to investigate Petitioner’s social history further,\nand AEDPA deference applies. It is on this holding that we\npart ways with the dissent. The dissent rests on the premise\nthat the Arizona Superior Court’s holding—that Sattler’s\napproach to mitigation was not deficient—was “contrary to”\nclearly established federal law and that, as a result, we should\nreview Petitioner’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim de\nnovo, not with AEDPA deference. That argument is flawed\nbecause it overreads Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374 (2005),\nand Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), in contravention\nof Pinholster’s clear instructions to the contrary. See 131 S.\nCt. at 1406-07 (“The Court of Appeals erred in attributing\nstrict rules to this Court’s recent case law.” (citing Rompilla\nand Wiggins)). Indeed, the dissent here appears to be making\nthe same argument made by the dissent in Pinholster, an argu-\nment that was necessarily rejected by a majority of the Court.\nSee id. at 1427 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“In reaching this\nconclusion, the majority commits the same Strickland error\nthat we corrected, applying § 2254(d)(1), in Wiggins: It holds\na purportedly ‘tactical judgment’ to be reasonable without\nassessing ‘the adequacy of the investigatio[n] supporting\n[that] judgmen[t].’ ” (alterations in original) (quoting Wig-\ngins, 539 U.S. at 521)).\n\n   Further, to the extent that the dissent finds support in Por-\nter, 130 S. Ct. 447, that case is distinguishable. Porter held\nthat the defendant “may have been fatalistic or uncooperative,\nbut that [did] not obviate the need for defense counsel to con-\nduct some sort of mitigation investigation.” Porter, 130 S. Ct.\nat 453. In Porter, counsel failed to conduct any investigation\ninto the defendant’s background—he did not interview any\nwitnesses or request any records. Id. Here, as the Arizona\n\f                             MILES v. RYAN                             9823\nSuperior Court held, Petitioner’s failure to disclose pertinent\nfacts about his background “guaranteed that [Sattler] would\nnot and Dr. Levy certainly would not, conduct further investi-\ngation into Petitioner’s background.” Sattler did conduct a\nmitigation investigation—she engaged an investigator who\ninterviewed childhood friends of Petitioner, attempted to call\nhis wife to testify at the penalty phase (but Petitioner refused\nto allow her to do so), and engaged Dr. Levy. Porter, there-\nfore, is inapplicable here.\n\n   But even if Sattler’s performance had been deficient, Peti-\ntioner suffered no prejudice. As with Petitioner’s claim\nregarding Sattler’s expert, the state court made no prejudice\nfinding on the failure to investigate claim, so we must review\nprejudice de novo. That review is not subject to the evidenti-\nary limitations announced in Pinholster, though it is subject\nto the limitations in § 2254(e)(2). See Pinholster, 131 S. Ct.\nat 1401 (“Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where\n§ 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. . . . At a mini-\nmum, therefore, § 2254(e)(2) still restricts the discretion of\nfederal habeas courts to consider new evidence when deciding\nclaims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state\ncourt.”). But even assuming that § 2254(e)(2) permits us to\nconsider the new evidence that Petitioner produced at the dis-\ntrict court,16 we see no prejudice.\n\n   First, as discussed above, Petitioner received a capital sen-\ntence primarily on account of three aggravating factors—\nprevious convictions for three armed robberies, committing\nthe car-jacking in pursuit of pecuniary gain, and committing\nthe murder in an especially cruel manner—and the sentencing\n  16\n    Even under review de novo and § 2254(e)(2), however, we do not\nconsider the new evidence produced on appeal in connection with the sup-\nplemental briefing on the Martinez issue discussed below. See United\nStates v. Waters, 627 F.3d 345, 355 n.3 (9th Cir. 2010) (“Facts not pre-\nsented to the district court are not part of the record on appeal.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\f9824                         MILES v. RYAN\njudge observed that the aggravators were unlikely to be out-\nweighed by anything less than substantial mitigation. Peti-\ntioner’s additional social history is, as the district court noted,\nlargely cumulative of what was already before the sentencing\njudge in the PSR, meaning that its mitigating value would be\nmarginal.\n\n   More significantly, the additional social history is equivo-\ncal, and not as alarming as that of the defendants in other\nfailure-to-investigate cases. See, e.g., James v. Ryan, 679 F.3d\n780 (9th Cir. 2012), petition for cert. filed, 81 U.S.L.W. 3047\n(U.S. June 28, 2012) (No. 11A1119). Petitioner’s mother was\na prostitute during his early years, though she turned to legiti-\nmate employment when he was about 11 years old. He may\nhave observed—but did not experience—violence in connec-\ntion with his mother’s prostitution. But, however problematic\nwere the circumstances of Petitioner’s mother’s lifestyle, she\ndid not neglect him, and there was no evidence that he was\never abused. To the contrary, Petitioner’s mother was clearly\nquite devoted to him. Moreover, whatever other problems\nexisted in Petitioner’s hometown, he had a community of\nfriends and a support system there, with responsible adults\nwho took an interest in him. He developed healthy relation-\nships that continued into adulthood. Finally, by all objective\nindications, he was socially well adjusted in high school.\n\n  Petitioner’s background was far more stable than, say, the\nbackground of the defendant in James, in which we granted\nhabeas relief from a capital sentence.17 The defendant in that\ncase, James, grew up in a household with a father who shot\nheroin in front of James and was a violent alcoholic who beat\nJames’ mother. James, 679 F.3d at 811. James grew up on\n  17\n     James is distinguishable on the deficiency-of-performance prong of\nStrickland because, in James, the state did not dispute deficient perfor-\nmance. 679 F.3d at 807. Also, the state court in James had denied the inef-\nfective assistance of counsel claim for procedural reasons, rather than on\nthe merits, meaning that AEDPA deference did not apply. Id. at 802.\n\f                             MILES v. RYAN                           9825\nwelfare and was both neglected and verbally abused by his\nmother. Id. Later, his mother took up with another violent\nalcoholic, but this one abused James as well as his mother. Id.\nGrowing up, James was frequently visited by an uncle known\nto have sexually abused other children in his family. Id. at\n811-12. At one point, James’ mother tried to smother him\nwith a pillow but relented at the last moment. Id. at 812. After\nliving in various foster homes and an adoption center for six\nto nine months, James was given up for adoption at age 4. Id.\nHe was eventually adopted by an older couple who physically\nabused him when he misbehaved.18 Id. at 812-13.\n\n   Similarly, the Arizona Supreme Court reversed a death sen-\ntence in State v. Trostle, 951 P.2d 869 (Ariz. 1997). Unlike\nPetitioner here, Trostle had been neglected as a baby. Child\nProtective Services received numerous reports about him,\nstarting with a report that he was found, at the age of 2 or 3\nmonths old, sleeping in his own vomit while wearing a soiled\ndiaper. Id. at 884. “His grandmother beat him regularly and\nonce severely burned him with hot water for wetting his\npants. His grandfather was convicted of sexually molesting\nhim over a substantial period of time beginning at age 11.” Id.\nAfter Trostle began acting out in sexually inappropriate ways,\njuvenile authorities placed him in a residential treatment and\neducational program when he was 14 years old. Id.\n\n  The newly uncovered portion of Petitioner’s social history\nsimply does not have significant mitigating value in view of\nwhat was already available to the sentencing judge. Thus,\neven if Sattler had been professionally deficient in failing to\ninvestigate and present these additional facts, it is not reason-\n  18\n    The dissent asserts, “[C]ontrary to the majority’s account, James did\nnot ‘grow up’ in the abusive circumstances described. Instead, at age four,\nJames was adopted by parents who were strict but loving, and his life cir-\ncumstances from thence forward took a dramatic turn for the better.” Dis-\nsent at 9838. But James’ adoptive father was so “strict” that, “[o]n one\noccasion, [he] whipped James so severely with a rope that he raised\nbloody welts all over James’s back.” James, 679 F.3d at 813.\n\f9826                         MILES v. RYAN\nably probable that the outcome of the aggravation/mitigation\nbalancing would have been different. Indeed, the new evi-\ndence does little to dispel Petitioner’s later social history, in\nwhich he acted as a functioning member of society for a num-\nber of years, demonstrating a capacity to overcome the hard-\nships that had burdened his youth.\n\n   Accordingly, the failure-to-investigate portion of Petition-\ner’s ineffective assistance claims fails on the first prong of\nStrickland, applying AEDPA deference. We note, however,\nthat Petitioner’s claim would fail on the first prong even under\nde novo review. Further, as discussed above, even if Peti-\ntioner could prevail on the first prong, thereby requiring us to\nreview de novo on the second prong, he would fail.19\n\n  D.    Effect of Martinez\n\n   Martinez does not help Petitioner. He had the assistance of\ncounsel in his post-conviction relief proceeding, and counsel\nraised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\nAssuming that Martinez applies in that situation, its exception\nis available only if Petitioner can establish that his post-\nconviction counsel was ineffective under the Strickland stan-\ndard and that the “underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\n   19\n      Petitioner argues that the state court made an error of law in suggest-\ning that it denied this portion of his ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims because his social history was not “new” evidence. Because Peti-\ntioner did not raise this argument in the district court, he may not raise it\nfor the first time on appeal. See Scott v. Ross, 140 F.3d 1275, 1283 (9th\nCir. 1998) (identifying a general rule of waiver for issues not raised below,\nsubject to a discretionary exception). Even if we allowed Petitioner to\nraise this argument, he could gain nothing more than review de novo\nunder the Strickland standard, which is itself deferential. See Frantz, 533\nF.3d at 737 (holding that, when “§ 2254(d)(1) is satisfied, then federal\nhabeas courts must review the substantive constitutionality of the state\ncustody de novo”). As noted above, the failure to investigate portion of\nPetitioner’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims would fail even under\nreview de novo.\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                       9827\ncounsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that . . . the\nclaim has some merit.” 132 S. Ct. at 1318.\n\n   [11] Here, it cannot be said that Petitioner’s post-\nconviction counsel performed his duties so incompetently as\nto be outside the “wide range of professionally competent\nassistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690. Even though Peti-\ntioner’s current counsel has now uncovered some new infor-\nmation beyond that presented to the state courts by his post-\nconviction counsel, that evidence is insufficient to demon-\nstrate that the previous lawyer’s investigation was objectively\nunreasonable. As detailed above, post-conviction counsel con-\nducted an extensive investigation, obtaining a psychologist to\nperform further testing and hiring an investigator who visited\nPetitioner’s home town and interviewed many people who\nknew him and his mother. Accordingly, Petitioner cannot\ndemonstrate that his post-conviction counsel was ineffective.\n\n   Furthermore, even with new evidence relating to his social\nhistory and drug use, Petitioner cannot rescue the claim that\nhis sentencing counsel was ineffective. As we have already\ndiscussed, sentencing counsel made a reasonable choice, as a\nmatter of strategy, not to focus on social history and addic-\ntion, opting instead to paint Petitioner as a normal person who\nmade a grave mistake during a tumultuous period in his life.\nPetitioner’s new evidence does not establish that this choice\nwas unreasonable.\n\n  In summary, even assuming that the Martinez exception\napplies to Petitioner’s case, he cannot satisfy its requirements.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n\n  Petitioner’s counsel adopted a permissible sentencing strat-\negy to show: (1) that Petitioner was a nice young man who\nwent with bad companions because he was depressed, who\nmay have been intoxicated at the time of the crime, who was\nremorseful, and who was worth saving through rehabilitation;\n\f9828                    MILES v. RYAN\nand (2) that he was just a very minor participant in the crime\nwho was surprised by the violent turn of events. She pre-\nsented mitigation witnesses to bolster this theory. To portray\nhim as a crazed drug addict with a sordid past would have\ncontradicted the chosen strategy. Petitioner’s arguments\namount to little more than a contention that his counsel should\nhave adopted a different strategy. Under Strickland, such\narguments must fail, and Martinez does not compel a different\nresult.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   I agree with the majority that Miles has not shown that he\nis entitled to relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. 104-132,\n110 Stat. 1214, on the basis of his counsel’s alleged deficien-\ncies in presenting addiction as a mitigating factor and in pre-\nparing Dr. Levy to testify. I cannot agree, however, with the\nmajority’s conclusion that Miles is not entitled to relief based\non his counsel’s deficient investigation of his troubled back-\nground. In rejecting this claim, the state court applied Strick-\nland in a way inconsistent with the holdings of several\nSupreme Court cases. Its decision was therefore “contrary to”\nclearly established Federal law, and we should conduct de\nnovo review. On de novo review, I would conclude that\nMiles’s counsel was constitutionally deficient and that Miles\nwas prejudiced by this deficiency. On this point, therefore, I\ndissent.\n\n  A.   AEDPA\n\n  The Arizona Superior Court rejected Miles’s failure-to-\ninvestigate claim on the ground that “a Defendant must bear\n\f                              MILES v. RYAN                             9829\nsome responsibility to assist his or her attorney in preparing\na defense [and that] an attorney should be able to rely on\nhis/her client to bring pertinent facts to his/her attention.”1\nBecause this ground is “contrary to . . . clearly established\nFederal law,” this claim should be reviewed de novo. 28\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(1); Frantz v. Hazey, 533 F.3d 724, 734 (9th\nCir. 2008) (en banc).\n\n   Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the seminal\nineffective assistance of counsel case, explained that\n\n      [t]he reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be\n      determined or substantially influenced by the defen-\n      dant’s own statements or actions. . . . In particular,\n      what investigation decisions are reasonable depends\n      critically on such information. . . . [W]hen a defen-\n      dant has given counsel reason to believe that pursu-\n      ing certain investigations would be fruitless or even\n      harmful, counsel’s failure to pursue those investiga-\n      tions may not later be challenged as unreasonable.\n\nId. at 691. What Strickland did not say is that a failure to\ninvestigate claim can be dismissed out of hand whenever the\ndefendant had information about his past and failed to provide\nit to his lawyer. Instead, Strickland stated only that competent\ncounsel can rely to some degree, with regard to the scope of\nan investigation, on what the defendant does tell the lawyer,\nnot on what he does not.\n  1\n    The state court also held that Miles could not make a claim under Ari-\nzona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(e) because his evidence was not\n“new.” Post-conviction Strickland claims in California are brought under\nRule 32.1(a), which allows post conviction relief when “[t]he conviction\nor sentence was in violation of the Constitution.” Because the two subsec-\ntions provide separate grounds for relief, the state court’s discussion of\nRule 32.1(e) does not bear on its Strickland analysis, and so it is irrelevant\nto this appeal.\n\f9830                     MILES v. RYAN\n   After Strickland, the Supreme Court specifically held, more\nthan once, that an attorney’s duty to investigate a defendant’s\nbackground in preparation for sentencing is not circumscribed\nby the degree to which the defendant offers up mitigating\ninformation about his past. In Porter v. McCollum, for exam-\nple, the court emphasized that whether a defendant is “fatalis-\ntic or uncooperative . . . does not obviate the need for defense\ncounsel to conduct some sort of mitigation investigation.” 588\nU.S. ___, 130 S. Ct. 447, 453 (2009). And in Rompilla v.\nBeard, the Court held counsel’s mitigation investigation defi-\ncient despite the defendant’s “minimal” contributions and\nrefusal to discuss his background. 545 U.S. 374, 381-82\n(2005). In contrast, the Court has explained, a defendant’s\nactive obstruction of counsel’s efforts to perform a mitigation\ninvestigation can prevent him from showing prejudice under\nStrickland. See Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 466\n(2007). Except in that circumstance, the Court has recognized,\na competent attorney would independently seek mitigation\nevidence rather than rely on the defendant’s representations\nabout his past.\n\n   Moreover, the ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of\nMiles’s sentencing specified that “[t]he investigation for the\npreparation of the sentencing phase should be conducted\nregardless of any initial assertion by the client that mitigation\nis not to be offered.” See ABA Guidelines for the Appoint-\nment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases\n11.4.1(C) (1989). “Prevailing norms of practice as reflected in\nAmerican Bar Association standards . . . are guides to deter-\nmining what is reasonable . . . .” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.\n\n   The state court did recite the general, two-prong Strickland\nstandard at the beginning of its opinion (under the heading\n“standard of review”). But then, as evidenced by the passages\nquoted above, the court did not apply that standard in accord\nwith clearly established Supreme Court precedents when eval-\nuating the substance of Miles’s claim as it related to Sattler’s\ninvestigation of his background. Instead, it held that there\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                       9831\ncannot be ineffective assistance of counsel—indeed, the ques-\ntion cannot even be litigated—if the defendant did not affir-\nmatively inform his counsel at trial of the information he now\ncontends should have been developed and used.\n\n   A similar sequence occurred in Lafler v. Cooper, in which\nthe state court articulated the correct standard established by\nStrickland but then “fai[ed] to apply Strickland to assess the\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised,”\nmeaning that “the state court’s adjudication was contrary to\nclearly established federal law.” 132 S. Ct. 1376, 1390\n(2012); see also Premo v. Moore, 131 S. Ct. 733, 743 (2011)\n(citing Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694 (2002), for the propo-\nsition that “[a] federal habeas court may issue the writ under\nthe ‘contrary to’ clause if the state court applies a rule differ-\nent from the governing law set forth in our cases . . . .”). In\nsum, the Supreme Court has never imposed an affirmative\ndisclosure obligation on defendants and has recognized that\nattorneys have an obligation to investigate mitigation evi-\ndence regardless of whether the defendant has provided miti-\ngating information to counsel.\n\n   The majority argues that it is wrong to “attribut[e] strict\nrules to [the Supreme] Court’s recent case law.” Maj. Op. at\n9822 (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 1406-07\n(2011)). I agree entirely. My argument is not that we should\napply a bright-line rule when evaluating the performance of\ncounsel; my argument is that the Arizona Superior Court\nerred by doing just that, treating the evaluation of Miles’s\nStrickland claim as if it turned entirely on the fact that he\ncould have told his lawyer about his childhood but did not do\nso. The Arizona Superior Court’s flat statement that “an attor-\nney should be able to rely on his/her client to bring pertinent\nfacts to his/her attention” is thus squarely inconsistent with\nclearly established Supreme Court law. Miles’s claim should\ntherefore be reviewed de novo.\n\f9832                    MILES v. RYAN\n  B.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n  In evaluating the merits of Miles’s ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim, I begin by comparing with some clarity and\ndepth the facts about Miles’s background known to Sattler\nbefore the sentencing hearing and the facts that came to light\nduring his state habeas proceedings.\n\n   The record paints a fairly clear picture of what Sattler knew\nabout Miles’s background before his sentencing. Viewed next\nto what came out later, it wasn’t much. In a detailed letter to\nDr. Levy, Sattler wrote that Miles was adopted when he was\ntwo months old, and that “all the information I have received\nabout [Miles’s adoptive mother] indicates that she was very\ndevoted to Kevin and worked very hard to give him material\nthings as well as a great deal of love and affection.” Sattler\nnotes that Miles moved to Winslow with his adoptive mother\nwhen he was young and then discusses his high school years,\nindicating that he was “well liked,” “active in student activi-\nties,” and that “there was never any incidence of violence in\nhis school years that anyone is aware of.” The information\nabout Miles’s pre-high school life takes up one paragraph in\nthe letter.\n\n   After interviewing Miles, Dr. Levy wrote a letter to Sattler\nin which he indicated that Miles’s adoptive mother “was a\nsingle parent who held a variety of jobs from professional to\nlaborer,” and that her habit of frequently changing jobs may\nhave been due to alcoholism. Still, Dr. Levy says, Miles’s\n“early years were described as good ones and ‘pretty nor-\nmal.’ ” The Presentence Report does not shed any additional\nlight on Miles’s childhood, repeating the assertion that his\nmother was an alcoholic and that “she cooked, waited tables,\nand worked at a convenience store, before becoming a nursing\nhome administrator.” The PSR also notes that Miles had trou-\nble fitting in because he was black in a small Arizona town.\nThis, then, was what Sattler knew of Miles’s childhood: that\nhe was adopted at a young age and that his adoptive mother\n\f                        MILES v. RYAN                      9833\nmay have been an alcoholic, but that she worked hard and\nprovided him with an upbringing that was “pretty normal.”\n\n   The investigations conducted after Miles was sentenced,\nwhich resulted in a 33-page report prepared for his state\nhabeas proceedings, paint a very different picture, one rife\nwith drugs, prostitution, and violence. Miles’s adoptive\nmother, Lois, was married to a pimp named Alfred Miles,\nwho ran a bar, restaurant, and hotel in Tulsa called El Rancho.\nMiles’s birth mother was one of Alfred’s prostitutes, and may\nhave been a heroin addict. Both Lois and Miles’s birth mother\nlived in rooms at the El Rancho. Lois was terrified of Alfred\nand often heard him beating Miles’s birth mother mercilessly,\npossibly while she was pregnant with Miles. Lois informally\nadopted Miles, and when he was two she took him and fled\nto Arizona, settling in Winslow.\n\n   In Winslow, Lois met Jasper Renfro, who operated a bar\ncalled the Prairie Moon, which had rooms in the back that\nwere rented to prostitutes for $2.00. Lois began working there\nas a prostitute and bartender, and moved into a two-bedroom\nhouse next door. Lois and Miles slept in one room, and prosti-\ntutes turned tricks in the other. When Lois had a customer,\nshe would ask one of the other prostitutes to watch Miles\nwhile she was occupied. Lois drank heavily, and although her\nfellow prostitutes insisted that none of them used drugs, a\nWinslow police officer who was interviewed once found her-\noin at the house and recalled that the women there were “all\ndrug addicts.”\n\n   Kevin Hernandez, who was Miles’s age and grew up on the\nsame block, remembered looking over the fence that faced the\nalley behind the Prairie Moon and seeing prostitutes having\nsex. He also remembered hearing gunfire on weekends. At\none point during Lois and Miles’s time at the house, “a girl\nnamed Charmaine shot an Indian at the house. The police fol-\nlowed the blood trail to the front door and tore the house apart\nlooking for the gun.”\n\f9834                     MILES v. RYAN\n   When Miles was around 7, he and Lois moved to another\nhouse a few blocks away from the Prairie Moon. A prostitute\nnamed Connie, who lived with Lois and Miles next to the\nPrairie Moon and was also a heroin addict, was shot and\nkilled about a year after Lois and Miles moved to their nearby\nhouse. Lois was trying to turn her life around at this point, and\ntook a job as a cook, although she may have continued work-\ning as a prostitute (her boss was a “known pimp,” according\nto the investigator’s report, and she occasionally left Miles\nalone at the restaurant). 1979, when Miles was around 11,\nLois got a job as a dietary aide at a convalescent center. She\nworked there for seven years, rising to become the administra-\ntor before being fired for drinking on the job the same year\nMiles graduated from high school. Lois and Miles slept in the\nsame bed until he was 14.\n\n    1.   Deficient Performance\n\n   The majority views Sattler’s decision not to further investi-\ngate Miles’s background as reasonable in light of her strategic\ndecision to present Miles as a fundamentally normal person\nwho had a viable chance of being rehabilitated if spared exe-\ncution. While the Supreme Court has instructed us to treat\nwith deference the strategic decisions of counsel, see, e.g.,\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1407-08, it is hard to see how Sattler\ncould have made a reasonable strategic choice not to present\nthe harrowing details of Miles’s childhood when she knew\nvirtually nothing about what that childhood was like. Treating\nthis strategic decision as determinative introduces an element\nof circularity into the analysis: Sattler’s choice not to learn\nabout Miles’s childhood was reasonable because it was part\nof her strategy, which she adopted because she knew nothing\nabout Miles’s childhood. As the Supreme Court has observed,\n“counsel’s failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigat-\ning evidence at sentencing [cannot] be justified as a tactical\ndecision . . . [where] counsel had not ‘fulfilled their obligation\nto conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s back-\nground.’ ” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 523 (2003) (quot-\n\f                             MILES v. RYAN                           9835\ning Williams, 529 U.S. at 396). In other words, a strategic\nchoice is only reasonable to the extent that “the investigation\nsupporting [that choice] . . . was itself reasonable.” Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 523 (emphasis in original). The relevant question,\nthen, is whether Sattler’s investigation “fell below an objec-\ntive standard of reasonableness. . . . under prevailing profes-\nsional norms.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.\n\n   Sattler’s efforts to investigate Miles’s background fell\nbelow prevailing professional norms. Sattler did work with an\ninvestigator in preparation for trial, but that investigator was\nnot trained in investigating homicide cases or conducting mit-\nigation investigations. Sattler’s letters to the investigator show\nthat Sattler was focused on finding people in Tucson who\nmight know something about the crime, rather than on finding\ninformation about Miles’s background.\n\n    Sattler did ask the investigator to interview four people\nfrom Winslow. Of these, the investigator spoke to three high\nschool friends who knew nothing of Miles’s earlier childhood.\nThe investigator submitted the fruits of these interviews to\nSattler in two “interview reports,” each a single page, and no\nformal background report was prepared. The investigator\nnever traveled to Winslow. When she was deposed in connec-\ntion with Miles’s federal habeas petition,2 the investigator had\nno recollection of Miles’s name or of her work on the case,\nand, looking over the record, she expressed surprise at how\nlittle information her investigation produced. Although Sattler\nknew that Miles had been adopted at an early age and that his\nmother was an alcoholic who had trouble holding a job, she\nand her investigator did nothing to find out about his pre-high\nschool life.\n  2\n   Because AEDPA deference does not apply to the state court’s rejection\nof Miles’s Strickland claim, Pinholster does not prevent consideration of\nevidence that was before the district court under § 2254(e)(2). Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1401.\n\f9836                     MILES v. RYAN\n   In short, this was not a case in which counsel “ ‘did spend\nconsiderable time and effort investigating avenues for mitiga-\ntion.’ ” Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1404 (quoting Pinholster v.\nAyers, 590 F.3d 651, 701-02 (9th Cir. 2009) (Kozinski, J., dis-\nsenting)). The ABA guidelines in effect at the time made clear\nthat “[t]he investigation for preparation of the sentencing\nphase . . . should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably\navailable mitigating evidence.” ABA Guidelines 11.4.1(C).\nThus, under the prevailing professional norms at the time of\nMiles’s sentencing, “counsel had an ‘obligation to conduct a\nthorough investigation of the defendant’s backrgound.’ ” Por-\nter, 130 S. Ct. at 452 (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n362, 396 (2000)).\n\n   Like the investigations in Porter and Wiggins, Sattler’s\nwork here fell well short of the thoroughness required in capi-\ntal cases. As in Porter, Sattler “ignored pertinent avenues for\ninvestigation of which [she] should have been aware,” 130 S.\nCt. at 453, i.e., Miles’s life up until he entered high school.\nAs in Wiggins, Sattler “abandoned [her] investigation of\n[Miles’s] background after having acquired only rudimentary\nknowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.” 539\nU.S. at 524. In Wiggins, those sources included psychological\ntests, records from the Department of Social Services docu-\nmenting petitioner’s time in the foster system, and a one page\naccount of petitioner’s personal history contained in the pre-\nsentence report. The materials available to Sattler were con-\nsiderably more scant. She did not ask Dr. Levy to conduct any\npsychological tests, and she obtained no comparable govern-\nment records concerning Miles’s childhood.\n\n   Even if Miles’s reticence about disclosing the details of his\nchildhood with Sattler is taken as a factor in the deficient per-\nformance calculus (rather than the sole determinant, as the\nstate court held), that reticence does not countervail Sattler’s\nfailure to investigate. After all, Miles may not have even\nremembered some of the circumstances of his early life, yet\n“early childhood trauma, even if it is not consciously remem-\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                       9837\nbered, may have ‘catastrophic and permanent effects on those\nwho . . . survive it.’ ” James v. Ryan, 679 F.3d 780, 815 (9th\nCir. 2012) (quoting Hamilton v. Ayers, 583 F.3d 1100, 1132\n(9th Cir. 2009)). Miles “may have been fatalistic or uncooper-\native, but that does not obviate the need for defense counsel\nto conduct some sort of mitigation investigation.” Porter, 130\nS. Ct. at 453 (emphasis in original) (citing Rompilla, 545 U.S.\nat 381-82). Sattler’s investigation into Miles’s background,\nparticularly her failure to learn any of the disturbing facts\nabout his early childhood, was not reasonably in line with pre-\nvailing professional norms.\n\n    2.   Prejudice\n\n   The majority characterizes the additional information about\nMiles’s childhood that came to light after his sentencing as\n“largely cumulative” of what was before the sentencing judge,\nand concludes that even if Sattler’s representation was not\nconstitutionally deficient, there was no “reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for [Sattler’s] unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different.” Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 694. I cannot agree.\n\n  It is worth remembering how little of Miles’s pre-high\nschool life was in the record when he was sentenced. The PSR\ncontains two paragraphs of social history, and has this to say\nabout Miles’s childhood:\n\n    The defendant reported his adoptive mother was an\n    alcoholic. She cooked, waited tables, and worked at\n    a convenience store, before becoming a nursing\n    home administrator. He reported he was not accepted\n    by everyone because he was black, and his mother\n    was white. He also indicate[d] he experienced ‘cul-\n    ture shock’ when he and his mother moved into a\n    more affluent neighborhood and attended a better\n    school.\n\f9838                    MILES v. RYAN\nDr. Levy’s report, which was also before the sentencing\njudge, indicates that Miles’s mother was an alcoholic and that\nracism was an issue for him, but notes that “his early years\nwere described as good ones and ‘pretty normal.’ ” These\nbrief summaries are, to put it mildly, a far cry from the infor-\nmation that came to light later, which showed that both\nMiles’s birth and adoptive mothers were prostitutes, that\nMiles’s birth mother was a heroin addict and may have been\nbeaten by her pimp while she was pregnant with him, and that\nMiles spent his early years living in a two bedroom brothel,\nsurrounded by prostitution, heroin use, alcohol abuse, shoot-\nings, and even murder. To call this childhood anywhere near\n“pretty normal” is strange indeed. The difference between\nthese two narratives is one of kind, not degree.\n\n   I also cannot accept the majority’s view that this mitigation\nevidence is far milder that in James v. Ryan, 679 F.3d 780. As\nin James, Miles survived a childhood rife with violence, drug\nuse, and crime. While there is no indication that Miles was,\nlike James, physically abused, James was not raised by prosti-\ntutes, nor was his childhood home the scene of murders and\nshootings. For, contrary to the majority’s account, James did\nnot “grow up” in the abusive circumstances described.\nInstead, at age four, James was adopted by parents who were\nstrict but loving, and his life circumstances from thence for-\nward took a dramatic turn for the better. Id. at 812. Miles saw\nhis situation improve somewhat as he aged, but he and his\nmother didn’t move out of the house next to the Prairie Moon\nuntil he was seven, and his mother may have continued to\nwork as a prostitute until he was 11. They slept in the same\nbed until he was 14. My point here is not to downplay the hor-\nrors faced by the young James, but to suggest that he and\nMiles survived conditions that were far more comparable than\nthe majority lets on.\n\n   The relevant question, at any rate, is not whether Miles’s\nstory is better or worse than any of the sad tales that have\ngraced the pages of the Federal Reporter, but whether there is\n\f                        MILES v. RYAN                     9839\na “reasonable probability” that he would not have been sen-\ntenced to death had it been told. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n694. Notably, “it is not necessary for the habeas petitioner to\ndemonstrate that the newly presented mitigation evidence\nwould necessarily overcome the aggravating circumstances.”\nCorrell v. Ryan, 539 F.3d 938, 951-52 (9th Cir. 2008). What\nis required “is a probability sufficient to undermine confi-\ndence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. In analyz-\ning whether the new mitigation evidence creates the required\n“reasonable probability,” Strickland instructs us to consider\nwhether “the omitted evidence would have changed the con-\nclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the\nmitigating circumstances.” Id. at 700.\n\n   Applying this framework shows that Miles suffered preju-\ndice due to Sattler’s deficient performance. The aggravating\nfactors established at sentencing were not overwhelming: The\njudge relied on four, one of which was later overturned by the\nArizona Supreme Court. The other three were based on (1)\nMiles’s three armed robberies, (2) the profit motive behind\nMiles’s participation in the crime, and (3) the “especially\ncruel manner” in which the murder was committed, a finding\nbased on the fear suffered by Baeuerlen during the twenty\nminute drive out to the desert. Against these aggravating fac-\ntors, the judge considered and rejected a variety of statutory\nand non-statutory mitigating factors. While the judge men-\ntioned that he had received numerous letters attesting to\nMiles’s previously non-violent nature, he discounted the let-\nters as irrelevant when considering the violent felon before\nhim. There was no mention of Miles’s childhood.\n\n   Given the weakness of the aggravating factors and the total\nabsence of any mention of Miles’s childhood in the judge’s\nsentencing, the additional mitigating evidence Sattler could\nhave uncovered is sufficient to “undermine confidence in the\noutcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “[A] penalty phase\nineffective assistance claim depends on the magnitude of the\ndiscrepancy between what counsel did investigate and present\n\f9840                        MILES v. RYAN\nand what counsel could have investigated and presented.”\nStankewitz v. Woodford, 365 F.3d 706, 716 (9th Cir. 2004).\nHere, that discrepancy was substantial. As in Williams, “the\ngraphic description of [Miles’s] childhood . . . might well\nhave influenced the [judge’s] appraisal of his moral culpabili-\nty.” 529 U.S. at 398.3\n\n  C.    Conclusion\n\n   Reviewing Miles’s claim de novo, it is clear that Sattler’s\nperformance was deficient, and that Miles was prejudiced by\nthat deficiency. Sattler could not have reasonably chosen the\nparticular strategy she decided upon without first making a\nreasonable investigation into Miles’s past, and the signifi-\ncance of the missing information is sufficient to undermine\nmy confidence that Miles would nevertheless have been sen-\ntenced to death. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\n\n  3\n   Because I would reverse on the present record, I do not address\nwhether Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012), allows Miles to intro-\nduce new facts at this stage.\n\f",

RYAN                             9801\nhis counsel was ineffective at sentencing because she failed to\nfocus on Petitioner’s drug addiction (rather than on intoxica-\ntion), enlisted an unqualified expert, and failed to investigate\nPetitioner’s social history thoroughly enough.\n\n  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and\n2253, and we affirm.\n\n         FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n  A.    The Crime\n\n   On an afternoon late in 1992, Petitioner was standing on a\nstreet corner in Tucson, Arizona, with Levi Jackson and Ray\nHernandez. Jackson was carrying a pistol that the three of\nthem had just obtained together; he had told Petitioner and\nHernandez of his plan to commit a car-jacking. Specifically,\naccording to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement to the police,\nJackson had told them that he was “gonna get somebody’s\ncar, take ‘em off in the middle of the desert, and shoot ‘em.”\nAt the time, Jackson and Hernandez were both 16 years old.\nPetitioner was 24 years old.\n\n   When Patricia Baeuerlen drove up and stopped at the cor-\nner, Jackson approached her car and asked for “a light.” When\nshe turned to reach her cigarette lighter, Jackson pointed the\nweapon at her and told her to move over. He unlocked the car\nto allow Petitioner and Hernandez to enter and sit in the rear.\nWhile Jackson drove the car out to the desert, Hernandez held\nthe pistol, but Petitioner also held it at some point. They drove\nBaeuerlen out of the city, into the desert, and stopped at a dirt\n\ncourt should grant a certificate of appealability only when a habeas peti-\ntioner has demonstrated “that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or,\nfor that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a dif-\nferent manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve\nencouragement to proceed further” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f9802                     MILES v. RYAN\nroad. There, Jackson told Baeuerlen to get out of the car and\ntake off her shoes and jacket. She obeyed. After taunting and\nharassing Baeuerlen for five to ten minutes, Jackson suddenly\nshot her in the chest. Baeuerlen died as a result of the gunshot.\nAccording to testimony presented at trial and sentencing,\nJackson—not Petitioner—shot Baeuerlen as he and Petitioner\nwere walking away from Baeuerlen and returning to the car.\nThroughout the ordeal, starting with the drive to the desert,\nBaeuerlen was pleading for her life.\n\n   After the shooting, Jackson, Petitioner, and Hernandez\ndrove away. According to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement,\nhe thought that Baeuerlen was still alive when they left her in\nthe desert. No one sought help for Baeuerlen. Later the same\nday, Petitioner used Baeuerlen’s ATM card, and a PIN that he\nhad found in her belongings, to take money out of her bank\naccount. The next day, Petitioner drove Baeuerlen’s car to\nPhoenix, where he went shopping at malls, exchanged\nBaeuerlen’s children’s Christmas presents for other goods,\nand went drinking with old friends. Petitioner told those\nfriends about the murder, insisting that he did not pull the trig-\nger, but smiling and laughing as he related the events.\n\n  B.   Arrest and Interrogation\n\n   In the early hours of the following morning, that is, the sec-\nond day after the murder, police arrested Petitioner in Chan-\ndler, Arizona, following a high-speed chase in Baeuerlen’s\ncar. The police found Baeuerlen’s ATM card, credit card,\njewelry, and other personal items in his possession. Later that\nmorning, Tucson detectives began a tape-recorded interroga-\ntion that lasted about five hours. During the interrogation,\nPetitioner initially explained his possession of the car by tell-\ning the detectives two different stories, neither of which\nplaced him at the scene of the murder. But, after several hours\nof interrogation, Petitioner admitted to his involvement in the\nmurder. Specifically, he admitted to knowing of Jackson’s\nplan to car-jack and shoot someone, to participating in obtain-\n\f                            MILES v. RYAN                  9803\ning the pistol with Jackson and Hernandez, to holding the\nweapon at some point during the drive out to the desert, and\nto watching Jackson shoot Baeuerlen.\n\n  C.    Trial and Sentencing\n\n   Soon after Petitioner’s arrest, Barbara Sattler was appointed\nas his counsel and represented him through trial and sentenc-\ning. After a jury convicted Petitioner of first-degree felony\nmurder, dangerous kidnapping, and dangerous armed robbery,2\nthe trial court reviewed a pre-sentence report (“PSR”) and\nheld a sentencing hearing.\n\n  The PSR states that the crime occurred at around 1:30 p.m.\nand that Petitioner reported having used crack cocaine “four\nor five hours earlier” and not having slept the night before.\nThe PSR also contains statements from Petitioner that he\nexpected to get money from the car-jacking and that he\nwanted to commit another robbery with the pistol. The PSR\nrepeats Petitioner’s assertions that he did not believe that\nJackson would kill Baeuerlen and that Petitioner thought that\nJackson would have killed him if he had tried to stop the mur-\nder.\n\n   The social history section of the PSR contains the follow-\ning information. Petitioner was adopted at the age of 4\nmonths. His adoptive mother was an alcoholic who neverthe-\nless maintained employment, eventually rising past jobs as a\nwaitress and cook to become a nursing home administrator.\nAlthough Petitioner is black, his adoptive mother was white,\nwhich caused some degree of social problems; those problems\ngrew worse when Petitioner and his mother moved to a more\naffluent neighborhood. Petitioner found a way to fit in by\nbecoming a “class clown” and by playing basketball. Indeed,\ndespite poor grades, he graduated from high school and won\na basketball scholarship to a Bible college, but he dropped out\n  2\n   As noted, none of these convictions is at issue here.\n\f9804                         MILES v. RYAN\nof college after only a week. Petitioner later served in the\nNavy, where he was disciplined for substance abuse and\nassault before receiving an other-than-honorable discharge.\nHe also married and had a child, though he later grew apart\nfrom his wife and began using drugs. His wife eventually left\nhim, leading him to be evicted from their apartment. A month\nlater, his mother died, and his drug habit grew worse.\n\n   At the sentencing hearing, Sattler called an expert, Dr. Mar-\ntin Levy, Ph.D., to discuss Petitioner’s drug use. Dr. Levy is\na clinical psychologist who had evaluated Petitioner during a\ntwo-hour session. Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner reported\nusing crack cocaine the night before the car-jacking. In partic-\nular, Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner’s “mental state was\ncompromised by intoxication . . . with cocaine.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Dr. Levy also testified that Petitioner’s description of\nhis mental state during the crime suggested a state of “disasso-\nciat[ion],”3 which was consistent with Petitioner’s reported\ndrug use.\n\n   The prosecutor objected to Dr. Levy’s testimony on the\nground that it lacked foundation. The sentencing judge agreed\nand determined that, because Dr. Levy had insufficient\nknowledge of when and in what quantities Petitioner used\ndrugs, he could not testify with specificity as to Petitioner’s\nlevel of impairment or judgment at the time of the crime.\nNevertheless, in Sattler’s closing argument, she reiterated her\nposition that Petitioner was “under the influence of drugs and\nalcohol that day.”\n\n   Sattler focused only briefly on Petitioner’s social history at\n  3\n    Dr. Levy’s testimony and reports use the terms “disassociation” and\n“dissociation” interchangeably. “Dissociation” is a “[s]eparation of psy-\nchologic experiences and events that are normally related, leading to a dis-\ntortion of experience and of the meaning of personal and interpersonal\nevents.” Robert J. Campbell, M.D., Campbell’s Psychiatric Dictionary\n289 (9th ed. 2009).\n\f                               MILES v. RYAN                              9805\nsentencing. Two character witnesses testified about his back-\nground and his nonviolent nature.4 Indeed, Sattler’s closing\narguments characterize him as a relatively normal person—\none who graduated from high school, who usually maintained\ngainful employment, who served in the military and com-\npleted most of his term of service, who married, and who had\na child—but who made some mistakes after his wife left and\nhis mother died.\n\n   Ultimately, the trial judge sentenced Petitioner to death by\nlethal injection.5 In so doing, the trial judge cited three aggra-\nvating factors:6 (1) that Petitioner had previous convictions for\nthree separate crimes of violence (armed robberies), (2) that\nPetitioner committed the car-jacking in pursuit of pecuniary\ngain, and (3) that the murder was committed in an especially\ncruel manner.7 The trial court also noted that the murder was\nsenseless, in that it was unnecessary to the escape of Peti-\ntioner and his accomplices.\n  4\n     In addition, Sattler planned to call Petitioner’s estranged wife to testify\nbut did not do so because Petitioner had objected. Similarly, she planned\nto call two other character and background witnesses, but they were\nunavailable because of a medical emergency. At sentencing, Sattler made\na statement on the record to document those circumstances.\n   5\n     The conviction, sentencing, and appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court\nall took place before the Supreme Court decided Ring v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), which requires a jury to determine all facts relating to eligibil-\nity for capital punishment.

See State v. Miles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192434\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192434/state-v-miles/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1035-36 (Ariz. 1996).\n   7\n     To support the cruelty finding, the trial judge found that Baeuerlen\n“suffered prolonged mental anguish and uncertainty as to her fate,” as\ndemonstrated by Petitioner’s own account of her “crying, screaming in ter-\nror, and begging for her life.”\n\f9806                         MILES v. RYAN\n   In mitigation, the trial judge rejected most of the potential\nmitigating factors. He rejected the contention that Petitioner\nwas only a minor participant in the crime. The trial judge also\nrejected unforeseeability8 of the murder and Petitioner’s age\nas mitigating factors. As to expressions of remorse, the trial\njudge found them insincere and, in any event, outweighed by\nthe aggravating factors listed above:\n\n      The court finds that the defendant’s expression of\n      remorse was insufficient to outweigh the aggravating\n      circumstances of this case. No remorse was evi-\n      denced when the defendant went to Phoenix, after\n      the murder, in the car of Miss Baeuerlen, to party\n      with his friends. No remorse was evidenced when\n      the defendant was captured by the Phoenix Police.\n      No remorse was evidenced when the defendant, a\n      day after the murder, was able [to] laugh when\n      detailing the murder . . . to a boyhood friend in Phoe-\n      nix.\n\n   The trial judge rejected the possibility of rehabilitation,\nfinding no evidence to support it. He went on to note that,\neven if he were to find a possibility of rehabilitation, that\nwould not outweigh the aggravating factors. The trial judge\nalso found that Petitioner’s cooperation with the police was\npurely self-interested and not sufficient “to establish a miti-\ngating circumstance or to outweigh the aggravating circum-\nstances.”\n\n   The trial judge did consider mitigation arising from the\nnature of the murder conviction—felony murder, rather than\npre-meditated murder—but found it insufficient to outweigh\nthe aggravating factors. The trial judge also considered Peti-\n  8\n    The trial judge went on to note that Petitioner could not have been sur-\nprised by the killing in view of his accomplice’s statement, before the\ncrime, that he was “gonna get somebody’s car, take ‘em off in the middle\nof the desert, and shoot ‘em.”\n\f                        MILES v. RYAN                          9807\ntioner’s reputation for nonviolence but did not find it suffi-\ncient to outweigh the aggravating factors, especially in view\nof Petitioner’s recent commission of three armed robberies.\n\n  Finally, of particular significance to this appeal, the trial\njudge rejected any drug-related mitigation, stating:\n\n    The court finds that there is no credible evidence that\n    the defendant’s capacity was impaired or that drugs\n    or alcohol had impaired the defendant’s thinking or\n    actions at the time of the crimes in question. . . . The\n    testimony offered by the defendant, from Doctor\n    Levy, Ph.D., as to impairment, was without adequate\n    foundation, and considered by the court to be with-\n    out value.\n\n  D.   Post-Conviction Relief Proceedings\n\n   On direct appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the\nconviction and capital sentence. State v. Miles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192434\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192434/state-v-miles/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Ariz. 1996). Petitioner did not petition for certiorari to the\nUnited States Supreme Court, but he did file a state court peti-\ntion for post-conviction relief (“PCR”) under Rule 32 of the\nArizona Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Arizona Superior\nCourt denied Petitioner’s PCR petition, rejecting his ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel claims on the merits. With respect\nto Sattler’s failure to focus on addiction, the state court con-\ncluded both that Sattler’s performance was not deficient and\nthat Petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice. With respect to\nthe other two claims in this case, the state court concluded\nonly that Sattler’s performance was not deficient—it made no\ndetermination as to prejudice. The Arizona Supreme Court\ndenied the petition for review of the PCR decision.\n\n   Before denying Petitioner’s PCR petition, the Arizona\nSuperior Court, however, ordered an evidentiary hearing. In\npreparation for that hearing, Petitioner underwent more exten-\nsive psychological testing. Dr. Joseph Geffen, Ph.D., a clini-\n\f9808                    MILES v. RYAN\ncal psychologist, prepared a report describing Petitioner as\nusing drugs to “self-medicat[e]” and as having resorted to\ncrime because of “his perceived need for drugs without which\nhe cannot cope.” Dr. Levy had described Petitioner’s drug use\nsimilarly, as self-medication, in his pre-sentence evaluation,\nbut did not connect Petitioner’s motivation for his crimes to\na need to acquire drugs.\n\n   In preparation for the state hearing, Petitioner’s counsel\nhired an investigator to probe further into his social history.\nThe investigator produced a detailed report, containing infor-\nmation gleaned from interviews with many people who knew\nPetitioner and his mother during his youth. The additional his-\ntory confirms that Petitioner’s mother was an alcoholic and\nsuggests that she may also have used heroin, or at least social-\nized with those who did. The investigation revealed that his\nmother worked as a prostitute and perhaps ran her own\nwhorehouse out of her home. When Petitioner was approxi-\nmately 11 years old, his mother began work at a nursing home\n(and may have given up prostitution); there, she rose to\nbecome an administrator, a position she held until Petitioner’s\nlast year of high school, when she was fired for drinking on\nthe job. Additionally, the report characterized Petitioner’s\nhometown of Winslow, Arizona, as being segregated, corrupt,\nand rife with prostitution, crime, drugs, and gambling. The\ninvestigation confirmed that Petitioner and his mother suf-\nfered at least some alienation due to their mixed-race house-\nhold.\n\n   The additional social history also suggests that Petitioner’s\nmother was an “extremely protective mother” who made him\nthe center of her life. She was “infatuated” with her son and\n“coddle[d]” him. She slept in the same bed as Petitioner until\nhe was 14 years old. She “read to him constantly and sang to\nhim when she fed him,” past an age considered “normal” by\na friend. The additional social history reveals that, although\nPetitioner’s mother disciplined him by spanking him with a\nhairbrush when he was 4 or 5 years old, she later discontinued\n\f                              MILES v. RYAN                             9809\nthe practice and did not physically abuse him.9 She bought\nPetitioner “everything he wanted” and, when he developed\nbuck teeth, for which other children teased him, she arranged\nfor him to get braces.\n\n   The additional social history report went on to discuss Peti-\ntioner’s relationships with his community. He went to church\ntwice a week for Bible study until at least his junior high\nschool years, receiving a ride from a local bus ministry. When\nhe was in junior high school, his basketball coach frequently\ndrove him home from practices. He became good friends with\na local family, spending a great deal of time at their home;\nindeed, they treated him like their own child. Notably, he\nremained in contact with members of that family well into\nadulthood—two of them were character witnesses at his sen-\ntencing hearing. According to those two witnesses, Petitioner\nstayed in touch with them after leaving Winslow and visited\nthem to introduce his wife. One of the witnesses was a close\nfriend when she and Petitioner were both living in Tucson;\nshe was present for the birth of his daughter.\n\n  The additional social history investigation also looked into\nPetitioner’s high school years, during which he played on the\nbasketball team and earned a varsity letter in his senior year,\nhelping to win the state championship.

RYAN\n  E.   Federal Habeas Proceedings\n\n   In late 2001, Petitioner filed this habeas corpus petition\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. The district court granted Peti-\ntioner’s request for appointment of an investigator and a doc-\ntor, and the court later granted requests for more funds for\nmitigation specialists.\n\n   Under the district court’s order, Dr. Geffen, who had exam-\nined Petitioner during the state post-conviction proceedings,\nexamined him again and prepared another report. In his\nreport, Dr. Geffen stated that, after learning about “modern\nmethods of evaluating mitigation factors in death penalty\ncases,” years after his initial evaluation of Petitioner, he\nthought that he “had not done as complete an evaluation as\npossible.” Dr. Geffen further concluded: (1) that Petitioner\nwas “experiencing an altered state of mind at the time of\n[Baeuerlen’s] murder;” (2) that, “[a]lthough physically pres-\nent, [Petitioner] was emotionally and mentally ‘not there’ in\nterms of his awareness and appreciation of events around him,\ndue to a dissociative state of mind, during which the event\nappeared to him as unreal and disconnected from him;” (3)\nthat Petitioner’s “substance abuse at the time was part of a\nlifelong adjustment problem which resulted in a severe state\nof depression, and that the drugs served the purpose of numb-\ning his perceptions after some catastrophic losses and per-\nsonal failures, including the loss of his mother and of his\nmarriage and family and job, almost simultaneously, rather\nthan being an isolated recreational act;” and (4) that Petition-\ner’s “altered mental state met the criteria for statutory mitiga-\ntion, since he was not capable of conforming to the lawful\nrequirements due to his impaired mental state.”\n\n   Around the same time, Petitioner was also examined by Dr.\nWm. Michael Cochran, M.D. Dr. Cochran concluded that, “at\nthe time of his participation in the crime(s) on December 7,\n1992, [Petitioner] was using alcohol, crack cocaine and mari-\njuana addictively” and that Petitioner’s “participation in the\n\f                           MILES v.

Her chosen tack—\ncharacterizing Petitioner as a relatively normal person who\nwas suffering from depression—evinces a desire to avoid\npainting Petitioner as a drug addict. At the very least, Sattler’s\nargument at sentencing raises the possibility that she was\nmotivated by such a strategy, which is all that Pinholster\nrequires. 131 S. Ct. at 1404-07.

Sattler’s decision to avoid assert-\ning that Petitioner suffered from an addiction, while focusing\ninstead on lingering intoxication from the use of crack\ncocaine, could be seen as inconsistent with a strategy of paint-\ning Petitioner as a normal person; if counsel thought that drug\nuse made Petitioner appear less deserving of sympathy, one\nmight think that she would have tried to avoid mentioning\ndrugs at all. But counsel’s strategy and decision are reason-\nable when viewed from her perspective at the time of trial, as\nStrickland requires us to do. Petitioner discussed his crack\ncocaine use in his confession, and it was mentioned in the\nPSR, so Sattler had to address it somehow.\n\n   [3] Moreover, Petitioner was sentenced in 1993.

Given the state of Arizona law at\nthe time of trial, Sattler would have been operating under the\nassumption that intoxication was the only viable means of\nexplaining Petitioner’s drug use to the sentencing judge. And\nthe evidence did not rule out some sort of lingering\nintoxication—Dr. Levy discussed it in his report.13 Seen from\nthis perspective, Sattler’s strategy did not fall outside the wide\nrange of professional competence or below an objective stan-\ndard of reasonableness.14\n\n  [5] Even if Sattler had been deficient in failing to focus on\naddiction, we see no prejudice, the second prong of the Strick-\n  13\n      Dr. Levy’s report discusses Petitioner’s condition at the time of the\ncrime as “coming down” from crack cocaine use the previous night and\nnotes that Petitioner was dissociated from the events. At trial, Dr. Levy\ntestified that this state is common among drug users.\n   14\n      To be sure, in Williams, we wrote: “The decision of the Arizona\nSupreme Court that drug use could not be considered as a mitigating factor\n‘of any kind,’ is contrary to the Supreme Court’s consistent decisions in\ncapital cases beginning more than a decade before Williams’ [1992]\ntrial.” 623 F.3d at 1270 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, as Petitioner’s\nbrief acknowledges, under Arizona law at the time of his trial, addiction\nwas not a recognized form of mitigation. Thus, although she could have\nrelied on existing United States Supreme Court decisions to challenge the\nArizona practice of ignoring the mitigating value of addiction, her strategy\nmerits deference under Strickland.\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                       9817\nland standard. In assessing prejudice, we consider the mitigat-\ning effect of Petitioner’s drug addiction and how it would\nhave altered the balancing of aggravating and mitigating fac-\ntors discussed at sentencing. See Porter v. McCollum, 130 S.\nCt. 447, 453-54 (2009) (per curiam) (“To assess th[e] proba-\nbility [of a different sentence], we consider the totality of the\navailable mitigation evidence—both that adduced at trial, and\nthe evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding—and reweigh\nit against the evidence in aggravation.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted) (brackets omitted)).\n\n   [6] As noted above, Petitioner’s case involved significant\naggravating factors, none of which would be affected by\naddiction. For many of the proposed mitigating factors\n(remorse, rehabilitation, cooperation), the trial judge made\ntwo findings—(1) that the evidence was insufficient to estab-\nlish the mitigating factor in the first place; and (2) that even\nif the mitigating factor were established, it would be insuffi-\ncient to outweigh the aggravating factors. It is highly unlikely\nthat a finding of addiction as a mitigating factor would have\ntipped the scales where none of the other proposed mitigators\ndid. Indeed, addiction could be characterized as merely\nanother element of social history, which the sentencing judge\nconsidered and found insufficient to outweigh the aggrava-\ntors. As stated by the district court:\n\n    The sentencing judge considered Petitioner’s life cir-\n    cumstances but found them insufficient to warrant\n    leniency. There is no reasonable probability that\n    focusing on Petitioner’s crack cocaine addiction, as\n    opposed to the reasons that led to the addiction,\n    would have changed the sentencing outcome.\n\n  [7] Under AEDPA, the state court’s decision denying this\nportion of Petitioner’s ineffective assistance claim must stand.\nThe state court did not apply Strickland unreasonably. See\nHarrington v. Richter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182992\"><a href=\"/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

RYAN\noperation when the case involves review under the Strickland\nstandard itself.”); cf. id. at 789 (“Rare are the situations in\nwhich the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical\ndecisions will be limited to any one technique or approach. It\ncan be assumed that in some cases counsel would be deemed\nineffective for failing to consult or rely on experts, but even\nthat formulation is sufficiently general that state courts would\nhave wide latitude in applying it.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n   “Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy task.”\nId. at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Sat-\ntler’s decision not to focus on addiction as a mitigating factor\nwas strategic and because Petitioner was not prejudiced as a\nresult, he fails to meet the Strickland standard here.\n\n  B.   Qualifications of Expert\n\n   Petitioner next argues that Sattler’s preparation of Dr. Levy\nwas deficient. The sentencing court did not allow Dr. Levy to\ntestify as to Petitioner’s drug use because of a lack of\nfoundation—Dr. Levy did not know how often Petitioner had\nbeen using drugs, or in what quantities. He did not even know\nif, or for how long, Petitioner had slept between the time he\ningested drugs and the time he committed the crime.\n\n   Although Sattler’s strategy—to focus on intoxication rather\nthan addiction—was reasonable, she may have failed to\nimplement it appropriately. But even if that failure represents\nperformance so deficient as to meet the standards applicable\nwhen we review a Strickland claim under AEDPA—a ques-\ntion we do not decide—Petitioner still fails to demonstrate\nprejudice. On this point, the state court made no determina-\ntion on the merits, so we must review de novo. See Porter,\n130 S. Ct. at 452 (“Because the state court did not decide\nwhether Porter’s counsel was deficient, we review this ele-\nment of Porter’s Strickland claim de novo.”). Significantly,\nthe sentencing judge was aware of Petitioner’s drug use—the\n\f                           MILES v. RYAN                        9819\nPSR, which quoted some of Dr. Levy’s opinions, contained\ninformation about Petitioner’s “coming down” from crack\ncocaine used the night before the crime, as well as a diagnosis\nthat Petitioner was in a “disassociated” state. The excluded\ntestimony would have added very little more.\n\n   Furthermore, as the district court noted, even if Dr. Levy\ncould have testified as to the effect of Petitioner’s drug use on\nhis mental state, that testimony would have been of limited\nvalue in view of: (1) Petitioner’s “acknowledgment that he\nwas not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of\nthe offense”; and (2) Dr. Levy’s other testimony that “regard-\nless of his drug abuse Petitioner knew the difference between\nright and wrong and was capable of walking away from the\noffense, thus negating any finding of significant impairment\nunder A.R.S. § 13-703(G)(1).”15 It is not reasonably probable\nthat Dr. Levy’s excluded testimony would have influenced the\nsentencing judge because, even if the judge had considered\nPetitioner’s drug use to be a form of reduced, nonstatutory\nintoxication, the mitigating effect of that condition would\nhave been insufficient to outweigh the aggravating factors\noutlined and discussed above. Consequently, Petitioner’s inef-\nfective assistance of counsel claim, regarding the qualifica-\ntions of Dr. Levy, fails on the prejudice prong of Strickland,\nreviewed de novo.\n\n  C.   Investigation of Social History\n\n   [8] Finally, Petitioner argues that Sattler’s performance\nwas deficient because she failed to investigate mitigating cir-\ncumstances thoroughly enough. Strickland itself involved a\nclaim of ineffective assistance for failure to investigate miti-\ngating circumstances. For that reason, Strickland is an espe-\ncially good starting point for analyzing Petitioner’s claim that\nSattler failed to investigate sufficiently his social history. The\n  15\n    Section 13-703 (1993) has since been renumbered as Arizona Revised\nStatutes section 13-751 (2011).\n\f9820                     MILES v. RYAN\nSupreme Court outlined the standards governing counsel’s\nduty to investigate as follows:\n\n    [S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation\n    of law and facts relevant to plausible options are vir-\n    tually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made\n    after less than complete investigation are reasonable\n    precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n    judgments support the limitations on investigation.\n    In other words, counsel has a duty to make reason-\n    able investigations or to make a reasonable decision\n    that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In\n    any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to\n    investigate must be directly assessed for reasonable-\n    ness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy mea-\n    sure of deference to counsel’s judgments.\n\n    . . . And when a defendant has given counsel reason\n    to believe that pursuing certain investigations would\n    be fruitless or even harmful, counsel’s failure to pur-\n    sue those investigations may not later be challenged\n    as unreasonable.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91 (emphasis added).\n\n   In Pinholster, the Supreme Court provided more guidance,\noverturning an opinion in which we had drawn, from other\nrecent Supreme Court cases, a “constitutional duty to investi-\ngate, and the principle that it is prima facie ineffective assis-\ntance for counsel to abandon their investigation of the\npetitioner’s background after having acquired only rudimen-\ntary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.”\n131 S. Ct. at 1406 (citation, internal quotation marks, and\nbrackets omitted). In the decision that Pinholster reversed, we\nhad explained that we “could not ‘lightly disregard’ a failure\nto introduce evidence of ‘excruciating life history’ or ‘night-\nmarish childhood.’ ” Id. (quoting Pinholster, 590 F.3d at 684).\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                         9821\n  In reversing us, the Court in Pinholster explained Strick-\nland:\n\n    “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s con-\n    duct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of\n    circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range\n    of legitimate decisions . . . .” Strickland itself\n    rejected the notion that the same investigation will\n    be required in every case. It is “[r]are” that constitu-\n    tionally competent representation will require “any\n    one technique or approach.”\n\nId. at 1406-07 (alteration in original) (citations omitted)\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688-89, 691, and Richter, 131\nS. Ct. at 788-89).\n\n   Here, Sattler’s actions are a reasonable implementation of\nher strategy—made explicit in her closing arguments at\nsentencing—to characterize Petitioner as a relatively normal\nperson who made serious mistakes after his wife left and his\nmother died. Cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 672-74 (finding that\ncounsel’s strategy—claiming “no significant history of crimi-\nnal activity” and arguing that the defendant “should be spared\ndeath . . . because [he] was fundamentally a good person who\nhad briefly gone badly wrong in extremely stressful circum-\nstances” arising from “his inability to support his family”—\nwas professionally reasonable, justifying a failure to investi-\ngate and present background information that might under-\nmine those claims).\n\n   [9] Sattler’s failure to investigate more thoroughly is justi-\nfied, then, by the irrelevance of additional social history to her\nchosen strategy. As Pinholster recognized, choice of a partic-\nular strategy can make “particular investigations unneces-\nsary.” 131 S. Ct. at 1407; see id. at 1407-08 (approving of the\nnotion that “ “‘humanizing” the defendant . . . may be the\nwrong tactic in some cases because experienced lawyers con-\nclude that the [sentencing authority] simply won’t buy it’ ”\n\f9822                    MILES v. RYAN\n(quoting Pinholster, 590 F.3d at 692 (Kozinski, C.J., dissent-\ning)).\n\n   [10] Because Sattler’s actions reflect a deliberate choice of\nreasonable strategy, they do not fall outside reasonable pro-\nfessional norms. We see no deficient performance in Sattler’s\ndecision not to investigate Petitioner’s social history further,\nand AEDPA deference applies. It is on this holding that we\npart ways with the dissent. The dissent rests on the premise\nthat the Arizona Superior Court’s holding—that Sattler’s\napproach to mitigation was not deficient—was “contrary to”\nclearly established federal law and that, as a result, we should\nreview Petitioner’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim de\nnovo, not with AEDPA deference. That argument is flawed\nbecause it overreads Rompilla v. Beard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005),\nand Wiggins v.

See 131 S.\nCt. at 1406-07 (“The Court of Appeals erred in attributing\nstrict rules to this Court’s recent case law.” (citing Rompilla\nand Wiggins)). Indeed, the dissent here appears to be making\nthe same argument made by the dissent in Pinholster, an argu-\nment that was necessarily rejected by a majority of the Court.\nSee id. at 1427 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“In reaching this\nconclusion, the majority commits the same Strickland error\nthat we corrected, applying § 2254(d)(1), in Wiggins: It holds\na purportedly ‘tactical judgment’ to be reasonable without\nassessing ‘the adequacy of the investigatio[n] supporting\n[that] judgmen[t].’ ” (alterations in original) (quoting Wig-\ngins, 539 U.S. at 521)).\n\n   Further, to the extent that the dissent finds support in Por-\nter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, that case is distinguishable. Porter held\nthat the defendant “may have been fatalistic or uncooperative,\nbut that [did] not obviate the need for defense counsel to con-\nduct some sort of mitigation investigation.” Porter, 130 S. Ct.\nat 453. In Porter, counsel failed to conduct any investigation\ninto the defendant’s background—he did not interview any\nwitnesses or request any records. Id. Here, as the Arizona\n\f                             MILES v. RYAN                             9823\nSuperior Court held, Petitioner’s failure to disclose pertinent\nfacts about his background “guaranteed that [Sattler] would\nnot and Dr. Levy certainly would not, conduct further investi-\ngation into Petitioner’s background.” Sattler did conduct a\nmitigation investigation—she engaged an investigator who\ninterviewed childhood friends of Petitioner, attempted to call\nhis wife to testify at the penalty phase (but Petitioner refused\nto allow her to do so), and engaged Dr. Levy. Porter, there-\nfore, is inapplicable here.\n\n   But even if Sattler’s performance had been deficient, Peti-\ntioner suffered no prejudice. As with Petitioner’s claim\nregarding Sattler’s expert, the state court made no prejudice\nfinding on the failure to investigate claim, so we must review\nprejudice de novo. That review is not subject to the evidenti-\nary limitations announced in Pinholster, though it is subject\nto the limitations in § 2254(e)(2). See Pinholster, 131 S. Ct.\nat 1401 (“Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where\n§ 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. . . . At a mini-\nmum, therefore, § 2254(e)(2) still restricts the discretion of\nfederal habeas courts to consider new evidence when deciding\nclaims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state\ncourt.”). But even assuming that § 2254(e)(2) permits us to\nconsider the new evidence that Petitioner produced at the dis-\ntrict court,16 we see no prejudice.\n\n   First, as discussed above, Petitioner received a capital sen-\ntence primarily on account of three aggravating factors—\nprevious convictions for three armed robberies, committing\nthe car-jacking in pursuit of pecuniary gain, and committing\nthe murder in an especially cruel manner—and the sentencing\n  16\n    Even under review de novo and § 2254(e)(2), however, we do not\nconsider the new evidence produced on appeal in connection with the sup-\nplemental briefing on the Martinez issue discussed below.

RYAN\njudge observed that the aggravators were unlikely to be out-\nweighed by anything less than substantial mitigation. Peti-\ntioner’s additional social history is, as the district court noted,\nlargely cumulative of what was already before the sentencing\njudge in the PSR, meaning that its mitigating value would be\nmarginal.\n\n   More significantly, the additional social history is equivo-\ncal, and not as alarming as that of the defendants in other\nfailure-to-investigate cases. See, e.g., James v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">780</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2012), petition for cert. filed, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">3047</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(U.S. June 28, 2012) (No. 11A1119). Petitioner’s mother was\na prostitute during his early years, though she turned to legiti-\nmate employment when he was about 11 years old. He may\nhave observed—but did not experience—violence in connec-\ntion with his mother’s prostitution. But, however problematic\nwere the circumstances of Petitioner’s mother’s lifestyle, she\ndid not neglect him, and there was no evidence that he was\never abused. To the contrary, Petitioner’s mother was clearly\nquite devoted to him. Moreover, whatever other problems\nexisted in Petitioner’s hometown, he had a community of\nfriends and a support system there, with responsible adults\nwho took an interest in him. He developed healthy relation-\nships that continued into adulthood. Finally, by all objective\nindications, he was socially well adjusted in high school.\n\n  Petitioner’s background was far more stable than, say, the\nbackground of the defendant in James, in which we granted\nhabeas relief from a capital sentence.17 The defendant in that\ncase, James, grew up in a household with a father who shot\nheroin in front of James and was a violent alcoholic who beat\nJames’ mother.

At one point, James’ mother tried to smother him\nwith a pillow but relented at the last moment. Id. at 812. After\nliving in various foster homes and an adoption center for six\nto nine months, James was given up for adoption at age 4. Id.\nHe was eventually adopted by an older couple who physically\nabused him when he misbehaved.18 Id. at 812-13.\n\n   Similarly, the Arizona Supreme Court reversed a death sen-\ntence in State v. Trostle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611397\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611397/state-v-trostle/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ariz. 1997). Unlike\nPetitioner here, Trostle had been neglected as a baby. Child\nProtective Services received numerous reports about him,\nstarting with a report that he was found, at the age of 2 or 3\nmonths old, sleeping in his own vomit while wearing a soiled\ndiaper. Id. at 884. “His grandmother beat him regularly and\nonce severely burned him with hot water for wetting his\npants. His grandfather was convicted of sexually molesting\nhim over a substantial period of time beginning at age 11.” Id.\nAfter Trostle began acting out in sexually inappropriate ways,\njuvenile authorities placed him in a residential treatment and\neducational program when he was 14 years old. Id.\n\n  The newly uncovered portion of Petitioner’s social history\nsimply does not have significant mitigating value in view of\nwhat was already available to the sentencing judge. Thus,\neven if Sattler had been professionally deficient in failing to\ninvestigate and present these additional facts, it is not reason-\n  18\n    The dissent asserts, “[C]ontrary to the majority’s account, James did\nnot ‘grow up’ in the abusive circumstances described. Instead, at age four,\nJames was adopted by parents who were strict but loving, and his life cir-\ncumstances from thence forward took a dramatic turn for the better.” Dis-\nsent at 9838. But James’ adoptive father was so “strict” that, “[o]n one\noccasion, [he] whipped James so severely with a rope that he raised\nbloody welts all over James’s back.” James, 679 F.3d at 813.\n\f9826                         MILES v. RYAN\nably probable that the outcome of the aggravation/mitigation\nbalancing would have been different. Indeed, the new evi-\ndence does little to dispel Petitioner’s later social history, in\nwhich he acted as a functioning member of society for a num-\nber of years, demonstrating a capacity to overcome the hard-\nships that had burdened his youth.\n\n   Accordingly, the failure-to-investigate portion of Petition-\ner’s ineffective assistance claims fails on the first prong of\nStrickland, applying AEDPA deference. We note, however,\nthat Petitioner’s claim would fail on the first prong even under\nde novo review. Further, as discussed above, even if Peti-\ntioner could prevail on the first prong, thereby requiring us to\nreview de novo on the second prong, he would fail.19\n\n  D.    Effect of Martinez\n\n   Martinez does not help Petitioner. He had the assistance of\ncounsel in his post-conviction relief proceeding, and counsel\nraised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\nAssuming that Martinez applies in that situation, its exception\nis available only if Petitioner can establish that his post-\nconviction counsel was ineffective under the Strickland stan-\ndard and that the “underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\n   19\n      Petitioner argues that the state court made an error of law in suggest-\ning that it denied this portion of his ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims because his social history was not “new” evidence. Because Peti-\ntioner did not raise this argument in the district court, he may not raise it\nfor the first time on appeal. See Scott v. Ross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1283 (9th\nCir. 1998) (identifying a general rule of waiver for issues not raised below,\nsubject to a discretionary exception). Even if we allowed Petitioner to\nraise this argument, he could gain nothing more than review de novo\nunder the Strickland standard, which is itself deferential. See Frantz, 533\nF.3d at 737 (holding that, when “§ 2254(d)(1) is satisfied, then federal\nhabeas courts must review the substantive constitutionality of the state\ncustody de novo”). As noted above, the failure to investigate portion of\nPetitioner’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims would fail even under\nreview de novo.\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                       9827\ncounsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that . . . the\nclaim has some merit.” 132 S. Ct. at 1318.\n\n   [11] Here, it cannot be said that Petitioner’s post-\nconviction counsel performed his duties so incompetently as\nto be outside the “wide range of professionally competent\nassistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690. Even though Peti-\ntioner’s current counsel has now uncovered some new infor-\nmation beyond that presented to the state courts by his post-\nconviction counsel, that evidence is insufficient to demon-\nstrate that the previous lawyer’s investigation was objectively\nunreasonable. As detailed above, post-conviction counsel con-\nducted an extensive investigation, obtaining a psychologist to\nperform further testing and hiring an investigator who visited\nPetitioner’s home town and interviewed many people who\nknew him and his mother. Accordingly, Petitioner cannot\ndemonstrate that his post-conviction counsel was ineffective.\n\n   Furthermore, even with new evidence relating to his social\nhistory and drug use, Petitioner cannot rescue the claim that\nhis sentencing counsel was ineffective. As we have already\ndiscussed, sentencing counsel made a reasonable choice, as a\nmatter of strategy, not to focus on social history and addic-\ntion, opting instead to paint Petitioner as a normal person who\nmade a grave mistake during a tumultuous period in his life.\nPetitioner’s new evidence does not establish that this choice\nwas unreasonable.\n\n  In summary, even assuming that the Martinez exception\napplies to Petitioner’s case, he cannot satisfy its requirements.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n\n  Petitioner’s counsel adopted a permissible sentencing strat-\negy to show: (1) that Petitioner was a nice young man who\nwent with bad companions because he was depressed, who\nmay have been intoxicated at the time of the crime, who was\nremorseful, and who was worth saving through rehabilitation;\n\f9828                    MILES v. RYAN\nand (2) that he was just a very minor participant in the crime\nwho was surprised by the violent turn of events. She pre-\nsented mitigation witnesses to bolster this theory. To portray\nhim as a crazed drug addict with a sordid past would have\ncontradicted the chosen strategy. Petitioner’s arguments\namount to little more than a contention that his counsel should\nhave adopted a different strategy. Under Strickland, such\narguments must fail, and Martinez does not compel a different\nresult.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   I agree with the majority that Miles has not shown that he\nis entitled to relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. 104-132,\n110 Stat. 1214, on the basis of his counsel’s alleged deficien-\ncies in presenting addiction as a mitigating factor and in pre-\nparing Dr. Levy to testify. I cannot agree, however, with the\nmajority’s conclusion that Miles is not entitled to relief based\non his counsel’s deficient investigation of his troubled back-\nground. In rejecting this claim, the state court applied Strick-\nland in a way inconsistent with the holdings of several\nSupreme Court cases. Its decision was therefore “contrary to”\nclearly established Federal law, and we should conduct de\nnovo review. On de novo review, I would conclude that\nMiles’s counsel was constitutionally deficient and that Miles\nwas prejudiced by this deficiency. On this point, therefore, I\ndissent.\n\n  A.   AEDPA\n\n  The Arizona Superior Court rejected Miles’s failure-to-\ninvestigate claim on the ground that “a Defendant must bear\n\f                              MILES v.

What Strickland did not say is that a failure to\ninvestigate claim can be dismissed out of hand whenever the\ndefendant had information about his past and failed to provide\nit to his lawyer. Instead, Strickland stated only that competent\ncounsel can rely to some degree, with regard to the scope of\nan investigation, on what the defendant does tell the lawyer,\nnot on what he does not.\n  1\n    The state court also held that Miles could not make a claim under Ari-\nzona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(e) because his evidence was not\n“new.” Post-conviction Strickland claims in California are brought under\nRule 32.1(a), which allows post conviction relief when “[t]he conviction\nor sentence was in violation of the Constitution.” Because the two subsec-\ntions provide separate grounds for relief, the state court’s discussion of\nRule 32.1(e) does not bear on its Strickland analysis, and so it is irrelevant\nto this appeal.\n\f9830                     MILES v. RYAN\n   After Strickland, the Supreme Court specifically held, more\nthan once, that an attorney’s duty to investigate a defendant’s\nbackground in preparation for sentencing is not circumscribed\nby the degree to which the defendant offers up mitigating\ninformation about his past. In Porter v. McCollum, for exam-\nple, the court emphasized that whether a defendant is “fatalis-\ntic or uncooperative . . . does not obviate the need for defense\ncounsel to conduct some sort of mitigation investigation.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In contrast, the Court has explained, a defendant’s\nactive obstruction of counsel’s efforts to perform a mitigation\ninvestigation can prevent him from showing prejudice under\nStrickland. See Schriro v.

Except in that circumstance, the Court has recognized,\na competent attorney would independently seek mitigation\nevidence rather than rely on the defendant’s representations\nabout his past.\n\n   Moreover, the ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of\nMiles’s sentencing specified that “[t]he investigation for the\npreparation of the sentencing phase should be conducted\nregardless of any initial assertion by the client that mitigation\nis not to be offered.” See ABA Guidelines for the Appoint-\nment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases\n11.4.1(C) (1989). “Prevailing norms of practice as reflected in\nAmerican Bar Association standards . . . are guides to deter-\nmining what is reasonable . . . .” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.\n\n   The state court did recite the general, two-prong Strickland\nstandard at the beginning of its opinion (under the heading\n“standard of review”). But then, as evidenced by the passages\nquoted above, the court did not apply that standard in accord\nwith clearly established Supreme Court precedents when eval-\nuating the substance of Miles’s claim as it related to Sattler’s\ninvestigation of his background.

RYAN                       9831\ncannot be ineffective assistance of counsel—indeed, the ques-\ntion cannot even be litigated—if the defendant did not affir-\nmatively inform his counsel at trial of the information he now\ncontends should have been developed and used.\n\n   A similar sequence occurred in Lafler v. Cooper, in which\nthe state court articulated the correct standard established by\nStrickland but then “fai[ed] to apply Strickland to assess the\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised,”\nmeaning that “the state court’s adjudication was contrary to\nclearly established federal law.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625833\"><a href=\"/opinion/625833/lafler-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In\nsum, the Supreme Court has never imposed an affirmative\ndisclosure obligation on defendants and has recognized that\nattorneys have an obligation to investigate mitigation evi-\ndence regardless of whether the defendant has provided miti-\ngating information to counsel.\n\n   The majority argues that it is wrong to “attribut[e] strict\nrules to [the Supreme] Court’s recent case law.” Maj. Op. at\n9822 (quoting Cullen v.

My argument is not that we should\napply a bright-line rule when evaluating the performance of\ncounsel; my argument is that the Arizona Superior Court\nerred by doing just that, treating the evaluation of Miles’s\nStrickland claim as if it turned entirely on the fact that he\ncould have told his lawyer about his childhood but did not do\nso. The Arizona Superior Court’s flat statement that “an attor-\nney should be able to rely on his/her client to bring pertinent\nfacts to his/her attention” is thus squarely inconsistent with\nclearly established Supreme Court law. Miles’s claim should\ntherefore be reviewed de novo.\n\f9832                    MILES v. RYAN\n  B.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n  In evaluating the merits of Miles’s ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim, I begin by comparing with some clarity and\ndepth the facts about Miles’s background known to Sattler\nbefore the sentencing hearing and the facts that came to light\nduring his state habeas proceedings.\n\n   The record paints a fairly clear picture of what Sattler knew\nabout Miles’s background before his sentencing. Viewed next\nto what came out later, it wasn’t much. In a detailed letter to\nDr. Levy, Sattler wrote that Miles was adopted when he was\ntwo months old, and that “all the information I have received\nabout [Miles’s adoptive mother] indicates that she was very\ndevoted to Kevin and worked very hard to give him material\nthings as well as a great deal of love and affection.” Sattler\nnotes that Miles moved to Winslow with his adoptive mother\nwhen he was young and then discusses his high school years,\nindicating that he was “well liked,” “active in student activi-\nties,” and that “there was never any incidence of violence in\nhis school years that anyone is aware of.” The information\nabout Miles’s pre-high school life takes up one paragraph in\nthe letter.\n\n   After interviewing Miles, Dr. Levy wrote a letter to Sattler\nin which he indicated that Miles’s adoptive mother “was a\nsingle parent who held a variety of jobs from professional to\nlaborer,” and that her habit of frequently changing jobs may\nhave been due to alcoholism. Still, Dr. Levy says, Miles’s\n“early years were described as good ones and ‘pretty nor-\nmal.’ ” The Presentence Report does not shed any additional\nlight on Miles’s childhood, repeating the assertion that his\nmother was an alcoholic and that “she cooked, waited tables,\nand worked at a convenience store, before becoming a nursing\nhome administrator.” The PSR also notes that Miles had trou-\nble fitting in because he was black in a small Arizona town.\nThis, then, was what Sattler knew of Miles’s childhood: that\nhe was adopted at a young age and that his adoptive mother\n\f                        MILES v. RYAN                      9833\nmay have been an alcoholic, but that she worked hard and\nprovided him with an upbringing that was “pretty normal.”\n\n   The investigations conducted after Miles was sentenced,\nwhich resulted in a 33-page report prepared for his state\nhabeas proceedings, paint a very different picture, one rife\nwith drugs, prostitution, and violence. Miles’s adoptive\nmother, Lois, was married to a pimp named Alfred Miles,\nwho ran a bar, restaurant, and hotel in Tulsa called El Rancho.\nMiles’s birth mother was one of Alfred’s prostitutes, and may\nhave been a heroin addict. Both Lois and Miles’s birth mother\nlived in rooms at the El Rancho. Lois was terrified of Alfred\nand often heard him beating Miles’s birth mother mercilessly,\npossibly while she was pregnant with Miles. Lois informally\nadopted Miles, and when he was two she took him and fled\nto Arizona, settling in Winslow.\n\n   In Winslow, Lois met Jasper Renfro, who operated a bar\ncalled the Prairie Moon, which had rooms in the back that\nwere rented to prostitutes for $2.00. Lois began working there\nas a prostitute and bartender, and moved into a two-bedroom\nhouse next door. Lois and Miles slept in one room, and prosti-\ntutes turned tricks in the other. When Lois had a customer,\nshe would ask one of the other prostitutes to watch Miles\nwhile she was occupied. Lois drank heavily, and although her\nfellow prostitutes insisted that none of them used drugs, a\nWinslow police officer who was interviewed once found her-\noin at the house and recalled that the women there were “all\ndrug addicts.”\n\n   Kevin Hernandez, who was Miles’s age and grew up on the\nsame block, remembered looking over the fence that faced the\nalley behind the Prairie Moon and seeing prostitutes having\nsex. He also remembered hearing gunfire on weekends. At\none point during Lois and Miles’s time at the house, “a girl\nnamed Charmaine shot an Indian at the house. The police fol-\nlowed the blood trail to the front door and tore the house apart\nlooking for the gun.”\n\f9834                     MILES v. RYAN\n   When Miles was around 7, he and Lois moved to another\nhouse a few blocks away from the Prairie Moon. A prostitute\nnamed Connie, who lived with Lois and Miles next to the\nPrairie Moon and was also a heroin addict, was shot and\nkilled about a year after Lois and Miles moved to their nearby\nhouse. Lois was trying to turn her life around at this point, and\ntook a job as a cook, although she may have continued work-\ning as a prostitute (her boss was a “known pimp,” according\nto the investigator’s report, and she occasionally left Miles\nalone at the restaurant). 1979, when Miles was around 11,\nLois got a job as a dietary aide at a convalescent center. She\nworked there for seven years, rising to become the administra-\ntor before being fired for drinking on the job the same year\nMiles graduated from high school. Lois and Miles slept in the\nsame bed until he was 14.\n\n    1.   Deficient Performance\n\n   The majority views Sattler’s decision not to further investi-\ngate Miles’s background as reasonable in light of her strategic\ndecision to present Miles as a fundamentally normal person\nwho had a viable chance of being rehabilitated if spared exe-\ncution. While the Supreme Court has instructed us to treat\nwith deference the strategic decisions of counsel, see, e.g.,\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1407-08, it is hard to see how Sattler\ncould have made a reasonable strategic choice not to present\nthe harrowing details of Miles’s childhood when she knew\nvirtually nothing about what that childhood was like. Treating\nthis strategic decision as determinative introduces an element\nof circularity into the analysis: Sattler’s choice not to learn\nabout Miles’s childhood was reasonable because it was part\nof her strategy, which she adopted because she knew nothing\nabout Miles’s childhood. As the Supreme Court has observed,\n“counsel’s failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigat-\ning evidence at sentencing [cannot] be justified as a tactical\ndecision . . . [where] counsel had not ‘fulfilled their obligation\nto conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s back-\nground.’ ” Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 (2003) (quot-\n\f                             MILES v. RYAN                           9835\ning Williams, 529 U.S. at 396). In other words, a strategic\nchoice is only reasonable to the extent that “the investigation\nsupporting [that choice] . . . was itself reasonable.” Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 523 (emphasis in original). The relevant question,\nthen, is whether Sattler’s investigation “fell below an objec-\ntive standard of reasonableness. . . . under prevailing profes-\nsional norms.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.\n\n   Sattler’s efforts to investigate Miles’s background fell\nbelow prevailing professional norms. Sattler did work with an\ninvestigator in preparation for trial, but that investigator was\nnot trained in investigating homicide cases or conducting mit-\nigation investigations. Sattler’s letters to the investigator show\nthat Sattler was focused on finding people in Tucson who\nmight know something about the crime, rather than on finding\ninformation about Miles’s background.\n\n    Sattler did ask the investigator to interview four people\nfrom Winslow. Of these, the investigator spoke to three high\nschool friends who knew nothing of Miles’s earlier childhood.\nThe investigator submitted the fruits of these interviews to\nSattler in two “interview reports,” each a single page, and no\nformal background report was prepared. The investigator\nnever traveled to Winslow. When she was deposed in connec-\ntion with Miles’s federal habeas petition,2 the investigator had\nno recollection of Miles’s name or of her work on the case,\nand, looking over the record, she expressed surprise at how\nlittle information her investigation produced. Although Sattler\nknew that Miles had been adopted at an early age and that his\nmother was an alcoholic who had trouble holding a job, she\nand her investigator did nothing to find out about his pre-high\nschool life.\n  2\n   Because AEDPA deference does not apply to the state court’s rejection\nof Miles’s Strickland claim, Pinholster does not prevent consideration of\nevidence that was before the district court under § 2254(e)(2). Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1401.\n\f9836                     MILES v. RYAN\n   In short, this was not a case in which counsel “ ‘did spend\nconsiderable time and effort investigating avenues for mitiga-\ntion.’ ” Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1404 (quoting Pinholster v.\nAyers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1434440\"><a href=\"/opinion/1434440/pinholster-v-ayers/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 701-02 (9th Cir. 2009) (Kozinski, J., dis-\nsenting)). The ABA guidelines in effect at the time made clear\nthat “[t]he investigation for preparation of the sentencing\nphase . . . should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably\navailable mitigating evidence.” ABA Guidelines 11.4.1(C).\nThus, under the prevailing professional norms at the time of\nMiles’s sentencing, “counsel had an ‘obligation to conduct a\nthorough investigation of the defendant’s backrgound.’ ” Por-\nter, 130 S. Ct. at 452 (quoting Williams v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (2000)).\n\n   Like the investigations in Porter and Wiggins, Sattler’s\nwork here fell well short of the thoroughness required in capi-\ntal cases. As in Porter, Sattler “ignored pertinent avenues for\ninvestigation of which [she] should have been aware,” 130 S.\nCt. at 453, i.e., Miles’s life up until he entered high school.\nAs in Wiggins, Sattler “abandoned [her] investigation of\n[Miles’s] background after having acquired only rudimentary\nknowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.” 539\nU.S. at 524. In Wiggins, those sources included psychological\ntests, records from the Department of Social Services docu-\nmenting petitioner’s time in the foster system, and a one page\naccount of petitioner’s personal history contained in the pre-\nsentence report. The materials available to Sattler were con-\nsiderably more scant. She did not ask Dr. Levy to conduct any\npsychological tests, and she obtained no comparable govern-\nment records concerning Miles’s childhood.\n\n   Even if Miles’s reticence about disclosing the details of his\nchildhood with Sattler is taken as a factor in the deficient per-\nformance calculus (rather than the sole determinant, as the\nstate court held), that reticence does not countervail Sattler’s\nfailure to investigate. After all, Miles may not have even\nremembered some of the circumstances of his early life, yet\n“early childhood trauma, even if it is not consciously remem-\n\f                         MILES v. RYAN                       9837\nbered, may have ‘catastrophic and permanent effects on those\nwho . . . survive it.’ ” James v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 815 (9th\nCir. 2012) (quoting Hamilton v. Ayers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1268223\"><a href=\"/opinion/1268223/hamilton-v-ayers/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1132\n(9th Cir. 2009)). Miles “may have been fatalistic or uncooper-\native, but that does not obviate the need for defense counsel\nto conduct some sort of mitigation investigation.” Porter, 130\nS. Ct. at 453 (emphasis in original) (citing Rompilla, 545 U.S.\nat 381-82). Sattler’s investigation into Miles’s background,\nparticularly her failure to learn any of the disturbing facts\nabout his early childhood, was not reasonably in line with pre-\nvailing professional norms.\n\n    2.   Prejudice\n\n   The majority characterizes the additional information about\nMiles’s childhood that came to light after his sentencing as\n“largely cumulative” of what was before the sentencing judge,\nand concludes that even if Sattler’s representation was not\nconstitutionally deficient, there was no “reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for [Sattler’s] unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different.” Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 694. I cannot agree.\n\n  It is worth remembering how little of Miles’s pre-high\nschool life was in the record when he was sentenced. The PSR\ncontains two paragraphs of social history, and has this to say\nabout Miles’s childhood:\n\n    The defendant reported his adoptive mother was an\n    alcoholic. She cooked, waited tables, and worked at\n    a convenience store, before becoming a nursing\n    home administrator. He reported he was not accepted\n    by everyone because he was black, and his mother\n    was white. He also indicate[d] he experienced ‘cul-\n    ture shock’ when he and his mother moved into a\n    more affluent neighborhood and attended a better\n    school.\n\f9838                    MILES v. RYAN\nDr. Levy’s report, which was also before the sentencing\njudge, indicates that Miles’s mother was an alcoholic and that\nracism was an issue for him, but notes that “his early years\nwere described as good ones and ‘pretty normal.’ ” These\nbrief summaries are, to put it mildly, a far cry from the infor-\nmation that came to light later, which showed that both\nMiles’s birth and adoptive mothers were prostitutes, that\nMiles’s birth mother was a heroin addict and may have been\nbeaten by her pimp while she was pregnant with him, and that\nMiles spent his early years living in a two bedroom brothel,\nsurrounded by prostitution, heroin use, alcohol abuse, shoot-\nings, and even murder. To call this childhood anywhere near\n“pretty normal” is strange indeed. The difference between\nthese two narratives is one of kind, not degree.\n\n   I also cannot accept the majority’s view that this mitigation\nevidence is far milder that in James v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. As\nin James, Miles survived a childhood rife with violence, drug\nuse, and crime. While there is no indication that Miles was,\nlike James, physically abused, James was not raised by prosti-\ntutes, nor was his childhood home the scene of murders and\nshootings. For, contrary to the majority’s account, James did\nnot “grow up” in the abusive circumstances described.\nInstead, at age four, James was adopted by parents who were\nstrict but loving, and his life circumstances from thence for-\nward took a dramatic turn for the better. Id. at 812. Miles saw\nhis situation improve somewhat as he aged, but he and his\nmother didn’t move out of the house next to the Prairie Moon\nuntil he was seven, and his mother may have continued to\nwork as a prostitute until he was 11. They slept in the same\nbed until he was 14. My point here is not to downplay the hor-\nrors faced by the young James, but to suggest that he and\nMiles survived conditions that were far more comparable than\nthe majority lets on.\n\n   The relevant question, at any rate, is not whether Miles’s\nstory is better or worse than any of the sad tales that have\ngraced the pages of the Federal Reporter, but whether there is\n\f                        MILES v. RYAN                     9839\na “reasonable probability” that he would not have been sen-\ntenced to death had it been told. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n694. Notably, “it is not necessary for the habeas petitioner to\ndemonstrate that the newly presented mitigation evidence\nwould necessarily overcome the aggravating circumstances.”\nCorrell v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427464\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427464/correll-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 951-52 (9th Cir. 2008). What\nis required “is a probability sufficient to undermine confi-\ndence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. In analyz-\ning whether the new mitigation evidence creates the required\n“reasonable probability,” Strickland instructs us to consider\nwhether “the omitted evidence would have changed the con-\nclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the\nmitigating circumstances.” Id. at 700.\n\n   Applying this framework shows that Miles suffered preju-\ndice due to Sattler’s deficient performance. The aggravating\nfactors established at sentencing were not overwhelming: The\njudge relied on four, one of which was later overturned by the\nArizona Supreme Court. The other three were based on (1)\nMiles’s three armed robberies, (2) the profit motive behind\nMiles’s participation in the crime, and (3) the “especially\ncruel manner” in which the murder was committed, a finding\nbased on the fear suffered by Baeuerlen during the twenty\nminute drive out to the desert. Against these aggravating fac-\ntors, the judge considered and rejected a variety of statutory\nand non-statutory mitigating factors. While the judge men-\ntioned that he had received numerous letters attesting to\nMiles’s previously non-violent nature, he discounted the let-\nters as irrelevant when considering the violent felon before\nhim. There was no mention of Miles’s childhood.\n\n   Given the weakness of the aggravating factors and the total\nabsence of any mention of Miles’s childhood in the judge’s\nsentencing, the additional mitigating evidence Sattler could\nhave uncovered is sufficient to “undermine confidence in the\noutcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “[A] penalty phase\nineffective assistance claim depends on the magnitude of the\ndiscrepancy between what counsel did investigate and present\n\f9840                        MILES v. RYAN\nand what counsel could have investigated and presented.”\nStankewitz v. Woodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785907\"><a href=\"/opinion/785907/douglas-ray-stankewitz-v-jeanne-s-woodford-warden-san-quentin-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716 (9th Cir. 2004).\nHere, that discrepancy was substantial. As in Williams, “the\ngraphic description of [Miles’s] childhood . . . might well\nhave influenced the [judge’s] appraisal of his moral culpabili-\nty.” 529 U.S. at 398.3\n\n  C.    Conclusion\n\n   Reviewing Miles’s claim de novo, it is clear that Sattler’s\nperformance was deficient, and that Miles was prejudiced by\nthat deficiency. Sattler could not have reasonably chosen the\nparticular strategy she decided upon without first making a\nreasonable investigation into Miles’s past, and the signifi-\ncance of the missing information is sufficient to undermine\nmy confidence that Miles would nevertheless have been sen-\ntenced to death. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\n\n  3\n   Because I would reverse on the present record, I do not address\nwhether Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
