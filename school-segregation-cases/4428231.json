Clear Channel Outdoors, Inc. (Tex. App.-Houston (1st Dist.) Jul. 2, 2009)(Taft).\nSee Appendix (1) for a 23-page copy of this authority.\n\n(d) Statement of the Case (Pursuant rule 38.1)\n\nThis case is an appeal by Appellant, Mr. Neira, of a summary judgment filed by the City.\n\nOn March 28, 2014, Mr. Neira, filed this suit in District Court pursuant Chapter 37\nDeclaratory Judgment of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code asking the trial\ncourt to interpret Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance to settle a controversy. There is\nno claim by Appellant of damages.\n\nOn September 14, 2014 the trial court rendered a summary judgment in favor ofthe City.\n\nOn January 23,2015, the Court ofAppeals issued an order accepting this\njurisdiction ofthis case and requesting Appellant's reply within 30 days.\n(e) Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\nAppellant does not request time for an oral argument, but is available ifthe Court of\nAppeals or theAppellee requests an oral argument.\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\f(f) Issues Presented\n\nThe primary issue is that the trial court erred because The Declaratory Judgments Act\nprohibits a summary judgment if there is \"real and substantial controversy that can be\nsettled by a declaratory judgment\". Controversy exists because the City, in its October 7,\n2013 letter, argues that replat of 3019 Knight Robin is valid based on the City's\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance. See October 7, 2013 City letter,\nin appendix in this Appeal, or, as exhibit 2 in Mr. Neira's original petition. Mr. Neira\nargues that the replat is not valid, based on his interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1).\n\nAnother issue is that the trial court erred in its September 14, 2014 summary judgment\nbecause interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1) of City Ordinance an issue of material\nfact, especially if Mr. Neira had requested a trial by jury. The evidence is Section 35-\n515(h)(1) of City ordinance.\n\nAnother issue is protecting public interest. Appellant strongly believes that proper\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(l) of City Ordinance will protect home owners\nthroughout the city of San Antonio, especially from water diversion damage and invasion\nof back-yard privacy. Long drive ways of flag-lots create car traffic in neighbors' back\nyards, which previously, had privacy. Proper interpretation by the City of its City\nOrdinances will help promote government integrity. For example, a September 20, 2013\nExpress-News article described indictment of a former official of the City's Planning and\nDevelopment Services Department for running a business that sold expedited building\npermits. Proper interpretation of City Ordinances by City officials will simplify replat\nand building permit applications and reduce the need for expedited services.\n\n(g) Statement of Facts (in chronological order)\n\nIn the middle of May 2013, Mr. Neira received a City notice titled \"Notice of Pubic\nHearing by the San Antonio Planning Commission\" (See Appendix for a copy). Mr.\nNeira telephoned Ms. Donna Camacho, who was listed on the notice, to ask if his\ntestimony at the May 22, 2013 public hearing would influence the May 22, 2013 replat\ndecision. Mr. Neira was told that his appearance at the hearing would not change the\ndecision and therefore, Mr. Neira did not attend. Mr. Neira reviewed the replat of 3019\nKnight Robin, whichwas attached to the notice of public hearing on May 22, 2013. He\nbecame concerned about reduction of privacy in his back yard and in potential flooding in\nhis back yard and in the neighborhood. Mr. Neira had had flooding of his house and is\nfamiliar with flooding in his neighborhood. Mr. Neira noticed thatthe new replat of 3019\nKnight Robin allowed for two new homes inthe back yard ofthe existing home at 3019\nKnight Robin, two new homes inthe back yard ofthe original lot at 3019 Knight Robin\nwould have access to the street(Knight Robin Drive) with 20-foot drive ways. Mr. Neira\nis aware of zoning requirements, such as 40-foot minimum street frontage in most\nneighborhoods in San Antonio.\n\n\nAppellant's(Neira's) Brief\n\fOn August 1, 2013, Mr. Neira visited the City's over-the-counter service office at 1901 S.\nAlamo Street to ask about City zoning for his neighborhood. The City over-the-counter\nperson was surprised when Mr. Neira mentioned that his neighbor at 3019 Knight Robin\nwas able to replat his one-acre lot into lots that included 20-foot street frontage lots. The\nCity over-the-counter person gave Mr. Neira a copy of zoning ordinance section 35-353,\nwhich requires 40-foot minimum street frontage for new lots in replats in Mr. Neira's\nneighborhood. She also gave Mr. Neira a copy of a new City ordinance, section 35-515,\nwhich allows back yard lots (flag lots) under certain conditions. Mr. Neira read the new\nsection 35-515 City ordinance and concluded that if certain conditions are not met, flag\nlots (back yard lots) must be approved by at a City variance board in order to be valid.\nThe lot at 3019 Kinght Robin was replatted without a variance board hearing.\n\nOn March 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed \"Plaintiffs Original Petition for Declaratory\nJudgment\" asking that the trial court declare the Planning Commission's May 22, 2013\nreplat of 3019 Knight Robin invalid, based on the Court's interpretation of Section 35-\n515(h)(l)of City ordinance, and based on no variance board hearing being held.\n\nThe City filed motions for discovery and Mr. Neira replied.\n\nOn or about August 14, 2014, the City's attorney filed a motion for summary judgment\narguing that Mr. Neira did not raise a genuine issue of material fact and that Mr. Neira\ndid not provide evidence, along with other claims. The City's request for summary\njudgment is titled \"Defendant Sheryl Sculley's Motion for Summary Judgment\"; and,\nconsists of an 18-page brief and a 93-page attachment.\n\nOn August 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed a reply to the City's request for summaryjudgment.\nMr. Neira's reply is titled \"Plaintiffs Response to Defendant's Summary Judgment and\nMotion for Summary Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff'. Mr. Neira's reply consists of a 6-\npage brief and a 20-page attachment.\n\nOn page 2 of his reply, Mr. Neira states as follows: There is real and substantial\ncontroversy that can be settled by a declaratory judgment.\"\n\nOn page 6, Mr. Neira states as follows:\n\"If the court agrees that Section 35-515(h)(l) of City ordinance is an exception that was\nnot met, and, that flag lots are not allowed, then Plaintiffrequests (prays) that the Court\ndeclare the following:\n\n    1. Thatthe City of SanAntonio's May 22, 2013 replat of 3019 Knight Robin is void\n       and judicially invalid because the replat allows for flag lots and the replat does not\n       meetstatutory requirements of Section 212 of the Local Government Code.\n\n\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\fAs evidence, Mr. Neira's reply included an 11-page copy of Section 35.515 of City\nOrdinance. The 11-page copy is titled Exhibit 4 in Mr. Neira's reply to summary\njudgment.\n\nOn September 12, 2014, Mr. Neira and the City's attorney attended a summary judgment\nhearing. On September 14, 2014 the presiding judge signed a summary judgmentin favor\nof the City.\n\nOn January 23, 2015 the Court of Appeals requested a Brief within thirty (30) days\nafter the date of the January 23, 2015 Order.\n\nWith this \"Appellant's Brief, Mr. Neira appeals the September 14, 2014 summary\njudgment decision.\n\n(h) Summary of Argument\n\nAppellant argued in his original petition before the trial court, and, Appellant still argues\nwith this appeal, that a substantial issue of controversy exists that can be settled with the\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act. The trial court erred because The Declaratory\nJudgments Act prohibits a summary judgment if there is real and substantial controversy\nthat can be settled by a declaratory judgment. Controversy exists because the City argues\nthat replat of 3019 Knight Robin is valid basedon its interpretation of Section 35-\n515(h)(1) of City ordinance. Mr. Neira argues that the replat is not valid, based on his\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1).\n\nThe City argued with its summary judgment that Mr. Neira did not raise an issue of\nmaterial fact and that Mr. Neira did not provide evidence. To this, Mr. Neira argues that\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(l) is an issue of fact, especially if Mr. Neira had\nrequested a trial by jury. Section 35-515(h)(1) is the evidence.\n\n (i) Argument\n\nOn March 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed his suit under Section 37.004 Declaratory Judgments\nof Civil Practices and Remedies Code (Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act). The\nDeclaratory Judgments Actprovides for a trial on merits for Mr. Neira's claim thatthe\nreplat of 3019 Knight Robin is invalid. Declaration of rights under Section 37.004\ninclude rights under \"municipal ordinance\".\n\nOn or about August 14, 2014, the City's attorney filed a motion for summary judgment\narguing that Mr. Neira did not raise a genuine issue ofmaterial fact and that Mr. Neira\ndid not provide sufficient evidence, along with other claims.\n\nOn August 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed a reply to the City's request for summary judgment.\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\fIn his reply, Mr. Neira states that there is real and substantial controversy that can be\nsettled by a declaratory judgment. The City argues thatthe replat of 3019 Knight Robin\nis valid based on its interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance. Mr. Neira\nargues that the replat is not valid, based on his interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1).\nMr. Neira argues that the replat is not valid because it does not meet either of the two\nexceptions in Section 35-515. Mr. Neira argues that in order for the lot at 3019 Knight\nRobin to qualify for replat under Section 35-515(h)(l), the lot at 3019 Knight Robin must\nhave been a lot with physical limitations or must have been a site with physical\nlimitation. Mr. Neira argues that 3019 Knight Robin did have a physical limitation and\ndid not qualify for flag lots without a variance hearing. Since no variance board hearing\nwas held, any new lot at 3019 Knight Robin must comply with the 40-foot minimum\nstreet frontage of normal zoning in section 35-353 of City ordinance.\n\nIn his reply to summaryjudgment, Mr. Neira states as follows:\n\"Ifthe court agrees that Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance is an exception that was\nnot met, and, thatflag lots are not allowed, then Plaintiff'requests (prays) that the Court\ndeclare thefollowing:\n\n   1. That the City ofSan Antonio's May 22, 2013 replat of3019 Knight Robin is void\n      andjudicially invalid because the replat allowsforflag lots and the replat does\n      not meet statutory requirements ofSection 212 ofthe Local Government Code.''''\n\nLarry E Potter, Appellant v. Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc, Appellee is relevant inthis case.\nIn the Larry Potter case, the Court of Appeals for the First District in Texas interpreted a\ncontract to determine if a summary judgment rendered by the trial court was in error.\nThe Court of Appeals for theFirst District in Texas determined thatthetrial court erred\nin its interpretation ofthe contract, and remanded the case to the trial court. The appeal\ncourt states in part. \"We remand this cause to the trial court with instructions to render a\ndeclaratoryjudgment infavor ofPotter consistent with this opinion and to consider\nPotter's requestfor the award ofattorney 'sfeesand cost under Texas Civil Practice and\nRemedies Code section 37.009.\"\n\nIf the Court of Appeals reads Section 35-515(h)(l) of City ordinance and agrees with Mr.\nNeira, that exceptions in this section are not met for the \"automatic\" replat of 3019\nKnight Robin, then a City Variance Board hearing is required. The replat then is invalid\nbecause a variance board hearing was not held within the required time. An unlawful plat\nor replat is violation ofSection 212.010(4) ofTexas Local Government Code.\n\n(j) Prayer\n\nMr. Neira asks that the Appeal Court render a declaratory judgment in favor of Mr.\nNeira-that the May 22, 2013 replat of3019 Knight Robin is invalid because Section 35-\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\f515 of City ordinance does not allowthe replat without a timely City Variance Board\nhearing, and a City Variance Board hearing was not held. The City is in violation of\nSection 212.010(4) of Texas Local Government Code.\n\nAs an alternative, Mr. Neira asks the Court of Appeals remand this case for a trial court\ndecision on Mr. Neira's request for declaratory judgment.\n\nMr. Neira' Affidavit\n\n\nMr. Neira is the Plaintiff, pro se, and makes this affidavitthat he is competentto testify in\nthis case, that he has personal knowledge of this case, that he is over age 18, and, that his\nstatements above are correct to the best of his knowledge.\n\nCertificate of Service\n\n\nMr. Neira certifies that his above-titled Notice was served by regular mail and by\ncertified mail to the Appellee's attorney and to co Appellee, Mr. Hovenden as listed\nbelow:\n\n\nFitzpatrick & Kosanovich, PC (Attorney for Appellee)\nPO Box 831121\nSan Antonio, TX 78283-1121\n\nRichard Hovenden, (prior defendant)\n3019 Knight Robin Dr.\nSan Antonio, TX 78209\n(3019 Knight Robin Dr. is located next door east of 3015 Knight Robin Dr.)\n\nOn this the //^fi day of FsJ/^fi^, 2015\nRudy Neira, Appellant, Pro Se            Date\n210 564-3634 office\n\n Appellant's Brief Respectfully Submitted,\n(yt<lJhL 9^U^^                      fab //,^/jT\nRudy Neira, Appellant, Pro Se          Date:\n3015 Knight Robin Dr.\nSan Antonio, TX 78209                210 564-3634 office\n\n\n\n\nAppellant's(Neira's) Brief\n\f       (k) Appendix in Civil Cases\n       (1) Necessary contents\n(A)Trial court's judgment: one page                                               1 page\n(B) Jury charge, conclusion of law: not applicable                                Non jury\n(C) The text of any rule, regulation, ordinance, statute, constitutional\nprovision, or other law (excluding case law) on which the argument is based,\nand the text of any contract or other document that is central to the argument:\n\n   (1) October 7, 2013 city letter central to the argument                        lpage\n   (2) May 22, 2013 Notice of Public Hearing by City Planning Commission          2 pages\n   (3) City ordinance section 35-515 (h)                                          11 pages\n   (4) City ordinance section 35-353                                              2 pages\n   (5) Chapter 37 Declaratory Judgments                                           4 pages\n   (6) Potter v.

Please know that staff\n attempted to contact you by phone on August 29, 2013 and September 3, 2013. However, we were\n unable to reach you or leave a message for a return call. Eventually, on October 3, 2013 staff did reach\n you to discuss yourconcerns regarding the platted property.\n\n         As you are aware, the Development Services Department reviewed your letters and appreciates\n your concerns for your neighborhood. Staff re-evaluated the plat approved by the Planning Commission\n on May 22, 2013 and subsequently recorded at the Bexar County Courthouse on June 14, 2013. Please\n understand, this plat meets the development regulations of the Unified Development Code (UDC) and\n therefore, rescinding of the plat is not applicable.\n\n        As you stated in your letter, NP8 zoning requires a minimum lot frontage of 40 feet in accordance\n with UDC Section 35-353 Neighborhood Preservation District. However, the flag lot provision in the\n UDC, Section 35-515(h)(1) Flag Lots, specifically supersedes Section 35-353 and allows for reduced\n frontage for flag lots. Furthermore, the requirement for the applicant to seek a variance through the Board\n of Adjustments and Appeals was not applicable in this situation. Additionally, you point out that two\n additional lots on Vandiver were subdivided. Please be aware these lots also meet the standard of the\n provision noted above regarding flag lots.\n\n         Regarding the property located at.3011 Knight Robin, Section 35-371(b) of the UDC allows for\n the construction of an accessory dwelling structure on the property. Also, this property was created by\n the replatting of a portion of Lot 3 to establish Lot 17, consequently leaving a remaining portion of Lot 3.\n Since then, the remaining portion of Lot 3 was divided by metes and,bounds survey and sold to two\n separate owners with the addresses of 3015 Knight Robin and 7214 Vandiver. State Law and the UDC\n require owners of lots created by survey, who require building permits in the future, be subject to\n replatting requirements in accordance with the UDC.\n\n If you need further assistance regarding theseissues, please do not hesitate to contact our office.\n Sincerely,\n\n\nclohn/P.

That Subsection\nreads as follows:\n\n(c) If the proposed replat requires a variance and is protested in accordance with this subsection, the\nproposed replat must receive, in order to be approved, the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the\nmembers present of the municipal planning commission or governing body, or both. For a legal protest,\nwritten instruments signed by the owners of at least 20 percent of the area of the lots or land immediately\nadjoining the area covered by the proposed replat and extending 200 feet from that area, but within the\noriginal subdivision, must be filed with the municipal planning commission or governing body, or both,\nprior to the close of the public hearing.\n\nTheCliffMorton Business andDevelopment Services Center is wheelchair accessible.

Standards areprovided to ensure that lots have adequate\n      access and conform to the zoning provisions of this chapter. The city finds and determines that long blocks\n      lined with homes andother buildings reduce streetconnectivity and impair the efficiency of public and safety\n      services, while increasing distances between residences andnonresidential destinations orpublic gathering\n      places. Exceptions to these standards aremade for non-urban districts and zoning districts (such as \"RP\" and\n      \"RE\") and districts which require greaterflexibility in order to encourage economic development(such as \"1-1\"\n      and \"1-2\").\n\n\n\n\nhttp://libraty.mimicode.com/HTML/14228/level2/ARTVDEST_DIV4LOLAHEDEINST.htm                                 1/23/2014\n\fDIVISION 4.

Vehicular access to nonresidential uses must be by public street, private street,\n                          or an irrevocable ingress/egress easement as specified under subsection 35-515(c)(4)\n                          and shall not utilize any property that is zoned single-family residential. However,\n                          pedestrian access may be provided by means of a dedicated easement or access way to\n                          promote pedestrian circulation on residentially zoned property and/or by means of a public\n                          or private street.\n                  (6)     Prohibition Against Creating Landlocked Conditions. Plat applicants shall ensure that\n                          there is no abutting landlock conditions created by the proposed plat.\n          (d)     Driveways. Restrictionson driveway areas are designed to avoid the domination of front yards\n                  by large expanses of impervious surfaces which deaden the streetscape and discourage\n                  pedestrian activity. Reducing the width of driveways can reduce total site imperviousness. Some\n                  techniques that can be used include:\n                  0)      Driveways and other impervious surfaces shall not comprise more than the percentage of\n                          the front yard as specified in column (B) for the use patterns or zoning districts designated\n                          in column (A). Driveway entrances shall not comprise more than the percentage of the\n                          front lot line as designated in column (B). Parking may be provided in the rear yard, and\n                          access may be provided through alleys, where the front yard is insufficient to\n                          accommodate a driveway.

Potter, appeals a judgment rendered upon a motion for\n\nsummaryjudgment filedby appellee,ClearChannelOutdoor, Inc. (\"Clear Channel\"),\n\fin a dispute concerning the construction oflease agreements. We determine whether\n\nthe trial court erred in granting Clear Channel's motion for traditional summary\n\njudgment and in denying Potter's motion for traditional summary judgment. We\n\nreverse the trial court's judgment in part, affirm the judgment in part, and remand this\n\ncause with instructions.\n\n\n                                    Background\n\n      In 1997, National Advertising Company (\"National\"), a predecessor in interest\n\nto Clear Channel, and Potter executed 10 identical1 ground leases, six of which are\n\nthe subject of this appeal. The leases were for a 10-year term, with an effective\n\nstarting date of August 1, 1995. Pursuant to each lease, National was permitted to\n\nerect billboard signs on tracts of land belonging to Potter in exchange for the greater\n\nof a fixed monthly rental or a percentage of the gross income that National derived\n\nfrom selling advertising space on the billboard signs. Under paragraph nine of each\n\nlease, \"at the termination of the lease,\" National had a \"right of first refusal\" to\n\ncontinue to rent the land if Potter chose further to rent or to use his land for outdoor\n\nadvertising. This right expired one month \"after the lease expire[d].\" Paragraph three\n\nofeach lease also gave National, under certain conditions, the right to \"terminate this\n\nlease\" and provided Potter the option to purchase the entire sign structures and\n\n\n\n1     The leases differed only with regard to the tract of property affected.\n                                           2\n\fpermits from National \"[i]n the event of such cancellation or in the event this lease\n\nis terminated for any reason and the parties have not executed a new lease or renewal\n\nof this Lease.\"\n\n\n      During the term of the leases, Clear Channel purchased six signs from a\n\npredecessor outdoor advertising company, and those six leases were assigned to Clear\n\nChannel.2 Clear Channel did not succeed in contacting Potter regarding renewal of\n\nits leases before their expiration date of July 31, 2005. On August 1, 2005, Clear\n\nChannel sent the usual lease payments to Potter, but Potter returned the checks by a\n\nletter dated August 25, 2005, in which he noted that Clear Channel's leases had\n\nexpired by their own terms on July 31,2005, and that he was \"declining to extend the\n\nground leases for an additional one (1) year term on a holdover basis.\" On August\n\n25, 2005, a representative of Clear Channel reached Potter, and they discussed\n\nrenewing the leases. On August 29,2005, Potter forwarded proposed renewal leases\n\nto Clear Channel, which Clear Channel received the following day. On September\n\n1,2005, Potter sent Clear Channel a letter informing Clear Channel that he intended\n\nto exercise his right to purchase the sign structures and permits, with the purchase\n\nprice to be decided pursuant to the \"terms of the ground lease.\"\n\n\n      Three of the remaining leases were also the subject of litigation and of a\n      separate appeal before this Court. See Nat'I Adver. Co. v. Potter, No. 01-06-\n      01042-CV, 2008 WL 920338, at *1 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist] Apr. 3,\n      2008, pet. denied) (memo op.).\n\f      After receiving Potter's September 1 letter, Clear Channel's attorney sent a\n\nletter to Potter detailing Clear Channel's position that, because its leases had not\n\n\"terminated, but rather [had] expired,\" paragraph three of the leases did not provide\n\nPotter the option to purchase the sign structures, and stating also that Clear Channel\n\nwas declining Potter's offer to purchase the signs.3 The letter also recited that Clear\n\nChannel was willing to continue discussions with Potter to execute new leases or to\n\nrenew the prior leases, as had already been communicated to Potter on August 30, but\n\nthat if a new lease agreement was not reached by October 20, 2005, Clear Channel\n\nwould begin removing the sign structures. Clear Channel continued to attempt to\n\n\n       Paragraph three of the leases provided:\n\n             3. Lose [sic] of Use of Sign Structures. If at any time the\n             highway view of [National's (later, Clear Channel's)] displays is\n             obstructed or obscured, or the use or installation of such displays\n             is prevented or restricted by law or by [National's (later, Clear\n             Channel's)] inability to obtain or maintain any necessary permits\n             or licenses, or if there occurs a diversion of traffic from, or a\n             change in the direction of traffic on highways leading past\n             [National's (later, Clear Channel's)] displays, [National (later,\n             Clear Channel)] may, at its option, terminate this lease as to such\n             specific location by giving 30 days written notice to [Potter]. In\n             the event of such cancellation or in the event this lease is\n             terminated for any reason and the parties have not executed a new\n             lease or renewal of this Lease, [Potter] shall have the option to\n             purchase the entire sign structure and permits from [National\n             (later, Clear Channel)] for the then current market value of an\n             installed fabricated structure, such value to be determined by the\n             average ofthree (3) bids to be obtained from three (3) major sign\n             fabricators.\n\fnegotiate renewal leases with Potter after this letter, but expressed to Potter that it had\n\nproblems with the language of the proposed renewal leases, and suggested alternate\n\nterms.\n\n\n         On October 18,2005, Potter filed suit against Clear Channel. Potter sought (1)\n\na temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and permanent injunction\n\npreventing Clear Channel fromremoving the billboards; (2) ajudgment in the amount\n\nequal to the fair market value for the use of the billboards on his properties beyond\n\nthe contractual period under the theory of quantum meruit; and (3) a declaratory\n\njudgment that Clear Channel had exercised its right of first refusal under paragraph\n\nnine by declining to accept the terms of Potter's proposed renewal leases and that\n\nPotter was therefore entitled to exercisehis right to purchase the entire sign structures\n\nand permits from Clear Channel for the current market value ofan installed fabricated\n\nstructure. He also prayed for recovery of his attorney's fees and costs.\n\n         Clear Channel filed an answer that generally denied the allegations in Potter's\n\npetition, raised the affirmative defenses of waiver and ambiguity, and contained a\n\ncounterclaim for declaratory judgment. In its counterclaim, Clear Channel sought\n\ndeclarations (1) that in order for the option to purchase under paragraph 3 to become\n\neffective, the lease must have \"actually been terminated\"; (2) that the leases had not\n\nterminated, but had expired; and (3) that therefore Potter did not have an option to\n\fpurchase the signs. It also sought to recover its attorney's fees and costs.\n\n       Potter filed a motion for traditional summary judgment on his declaratory\n\njudgment claim only; while that motion was still pending, Clear Channel filed its own\n\nmotion for summary judgment that also addressed only the declaratory judgment\n\nclaims. Neither motion addressed the quantummeruit claim in Potter's petition, and\n\nClear Channel's motion did not address Potter's claim for attorney's fees and costs.4\n\n       Potter's motion for traditional summary judgment sought declarations that\n\n(1)Clear Channel hadexercised itsright offirst refusal byrejecting Potter'sproposed\n\nlease agreement and (2) Potter was entitled to exercise his option to purchase sign\n\nstructures andpermits from Clear Channel. Asgrounds forhis motion, Potterargued\n\nthat\n\n\n       (1)   Clear Channel's rejection of the terms of Potter's proposed\n             renewal lease agreements was an exercise of its right of first\n             refusal under paragraph nine of the leases and Clear Channel\n             could no longer accept Potter's offer to extend the lease\n             agreements and\n\n       (2)   Potter was entitled to exercise his right to purchase the entire sign\n             structures and permits pursuant to the terms ofparagraph three of\n             the Leases, because such paragraph gave him the option to\n             purchase \"in the event [that the] lease [was] terminated for any\n             reason and the parties [had] not executed a new lease or renewal\n             of the lease.\" Potter asserted that because the leases had expired\n             and there were no new leases or renewal of the prior leases\n\n\n       Potter's injunctive reliefrequests were resolved by way ofa rule 11 agreement\n       between the parties.\n\f             between the parties, his option to purchase became effective.\n\nIn addition to a declaratory judgment in his favor, Potter sought recovery of his\n\nattorney's fees and costs.\n\n      In its motion for traditional summary judgment, Clear Channel also pursued a\n\njudicial declaration interpreting paragraph three of the leases. Clear Channel's\n\nmotiondid not specifywhetherClearChannel was moving for summaryjudgment on\n\nits declaratory judgment counterclaim, or attempting to defeat Potter's declaratory\n\njudgment claim, or both, although language in the motion suggested the last.5 As its\n\ngrounds for the grant of its summary judgment, Clear Channel argued that\n\n      (1)    the Leaseswerenot ambiguous and Potterhad no effectiveoption\n             to purchase because the leases had \"expired,\" rather than\n             \"terminated,\" and paragraph three provided Potter the option to\n             purchase only upon the \"termination\" of the lease\n\n      (2)    alternatively, the leases were ambiguous and should be construed\n             against Potter and the leases should be construed to mean that the\n             option to purchase did not arise in the event of the expiration of\n             the leases, but only on their termination; and\n\n      (3)    alternatively, Potter had waived any option to purchase because\n             discussions continued between Potter and Clear Channel about\n             possible renewal of the leases after Potter had attempted to\n             exercise his option to purchase.\n\n      Clear Channel prayed that summary judgment be granted \"on all grounds\n\n\n\n      In a later filing, Clear Channel stated that \"both sides have filed motions for\n      summary judgment regarding their respective declarations.\"\n\fstated\" in the motion, that Potter \"take nothing on his claim against Clear Channel,\"\n\nand that the court award Clear Channel its costs of court and reasonable attorney's\n\nfees. Clear Channel also prayed that, \"if summary judgment for Clear Channel [was]\n\nnot rendered as to all of Clear Channel's claims, or for all the relief requested,\" the\n\ntrial court enter an order specifying the facts that were without substantial\n\ncontroversy.\n\n      On June 18,2007, the trial court granted Clear Channel's motion for summary\n\njudgment and denied Potter's motion for summary judgment in an order that read:\n\n      On this day came to be considered PlaintiffLarry E. Potter's Motion for\n      Summary Judgment and Defendant Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc.'s\n      Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The court, having considered the\n      motion, pleadings, responses, and summary judgment evidence hereby\n      DENIES Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment and GRANTS\n      Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n      It is therefore ORDERED that Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment\n      is DENIED and Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is\n      GRANTED.\n\n\n       On August 14, 2007, the trial court issued a final judgment, confirming the\n\ngrant ofClear Channel's motion and the denial ofPotter's motion, and denying Clear\n\nChannel's request for attorney's fees. The judgment read:\n\n      By Order dated June 18, 2007, the Court denied Plaintiff Larry E.\n      Potter's Motion for Summary Judgment and granted Defendant Clear\n      Channel Outdoor, Inc.'s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.              In\n      doing so, the Court failed to address Clear Channel's request for an\n      award of attorney's fees. Accordingly, it is\n\f     ORDERED that Defendant Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. 's request for an\n     award of attorney's fees is hereby denied.\n\n     This is a final and appealable judgment, which, in conjunction with the\n     Court's order ofJune 18,2007, disposes ofall claims and parties in this\n     cause.6\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n\n     In two issues, Potter contends that the trial court erroneously granted Clear\n\nChannel's motion for summary judgment and erroneously denied his motion for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       Both parties' motions sought summary judgments that would declare the\n\n\n     Nothing in the record indicates that Potter's quantum meruit claim for the fair\n     market value of the use of the billboards on his properties beyond the\n     contractual period was ever presented to the court for resolution either by trial,\n     summary judgment, or dismissal. However, the language of the \"final\n     judgment\" indicates that the judgment was meant to dispose of all claims and\n     all parties, and it clearly expresses the trial court's intent that the judgment be\n     final. See Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 200 (Tex. 2001)\n     (holding that language ofjudgment can make judgment final, even though it\n     should have been interlocutory, when intent to finally dispose of case is\n     unequivocally expressed in words of judgment). \"A judgment which grants\n     more relief than a party is entitled to is subject to reversal, but is not, for that\n     reason alone, interlocutory.\" Id. The judgment before us, therefore, is final,\n     albeit subject to challenge as erroneous to the extent that it disposed ofa claim\n     without \"an adequate basis for the rendition ofjudgment.\" See id. However,\n     Potter does not complain on appeal, either by issue or argument, of the trial\n     court's disposition of his quantum meruit claim. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n     Accordingly, we will affirm that portion ofthe judgment without regard to the\n     merits. See Garcia v. Nat'I Eligibility Express, Inc., 4 S.W.3d 887, 889 (Tex.\n     App.—Houston [1st Dist] 1999, no pet.) (citing Walling v. Metcalfe, 863\n     S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex. 1993)).\n\fparties' rights pursuant to the declaratory judgment actions.7 We review declaratory\n\njudgments under the same standards as otherjudgments. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n\nCode Ann. § 37.010 (Vernon 2008). We look to the procedure used to resolve the\n\nissue below to determine the standard ofreview on appeal. City ofGalveston v. Tex.\n\nGen. Land Office, 196 S.W.3d 218,221 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist] 2006, pet.\n\ndenied). When a trial court resolves a declaratory judgment action on competing\n\nmotions for summaryjudgment, \"we review the propriety ofthe declaratoryjudgment\n\nunder the same standards that we apply in reviewing a summary judgment.\" Id.\n\n      We review a trial court's decision to grant or to deny a motion for summary\n\n\n\n      See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §§ 37.001-.011 (Vernon 2008).\n\n      We note that the trial court's final judgment failed to actually declare any\n      rights of the parties. In a declaratory judgment action, if a declaratory\n      judgment would terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the\n      lawsuit, the trial court is duty-bound to declare the rights ofthe parties as to the\n      matters on which the parties join issue. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n      Ann. § 37.008 (Vernon 2008); Spawglass Constr. Corp. v. City ofHouston,\n      91A S.W.2d 876, 878 (Tex.

The judgment in the case before us did\n      not make any declarations regarding the matters for which declarations were\n      sought by the parties. This was error. When a trial court errs by failing to\n      declare the rights of the parties in its judgment, the appellate court may\n      determine the rights of parties and render the judgment that the trial court\n      should have rendered. See Spawglass Constr., 91A S.W.2d at 879; James v.\n      HitchcockIndep. Sch. Dist., 742 S.W.2d 701, 705 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n      Dist.] 1987, writ denied); Am. Eagle Ins. Co. v.

Although a denial of summary judgment is not normally reviewable, we\n\nmay review such a denial when both parties move for summary judgment and the trial\n\ncourt grants one motion and denies the other.

Tex. Mun. Power Agency, 253 S.W.3d at 192 (citing Comm'rs Court v.\n\nAgan, 940 S.W.2d 77, 81 (Tex. 1997)).\n\n      Under the traditional summary judgment standard, the movant has the burden\n\nto show that no genuine issues ofmaterial fact exist and that it is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.

FM\n\nProps. Operating Co. v. City ofAustin, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872 (Tex. 2000).\n\n                Clear Channel's Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n      Potter's first issue complains of the trial court's grant of Clear Channel's\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Potter challenges all three of Clear Channel's\n\ngrounds for summaryjudgment, arguing that the trial court incorrectly interpreted the\n\nleases and that he did not waive his right to exercise his option to purchase.\n\nA.    Construction of the Leases\n\n\n      Clear Channel's first two grounds for summary judgment related to the\n\nconstruction of the leases and specifically to the question of whether the phrase,\n\n      ... [i]n the event of such cancellation or in the event this lease is\n      terminated for any reason and the parties have not executed a new lease\n      or renewal of this Lease, [Potter] shall have the option to purchase the\n      entire sign structure and permits from [National (later, Clear Channel)]\n\n                                         12\n\fthat is contained in paragraph three of the leases provided Potter an option to\n\npurchase the sign structures and permits when the lease terms expired. Clear Channel\n\nargued that the word \"terminated\" did not include the expiration of a lease. Potter\n\nargued that the phrase \"terminated for any other reason\" included the expiration of\n\nthe leases at the end of their natural terms.\n\n\n      We construe a lease under the well-established rules of contract construction.\n\nSeeLuccia v. Ross, 21A S.W.3d 140,146 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet.\n\ndenied). In construing a written contract, the primary concern is to ascertain and to\n\ngive effect to the parties' intentions as expressed in the document. Frost Nat 7 Bank\n\nv. L&FDistribs., Ltd., 165 S.W.3d 310,311-12 (Tex. 2005). We consider the entire\n\nwriting and attempt to harmonize and to give effect to all of the provisions of the\n\ncontract by analyzing the provisions with reference to the whole agreement. Id. at\n\n312. No single provision is given controlling effect. J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster,\n\n128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex. 2003). \"In harmonizing these provisions, terms stated\n\nearlier in an agreement must be favored over subsequent terms.\" Coker v. Coker, 650\n\nS.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex. 1983). We construe contracts \"from a utilitarian standpoint\n\nbearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served\" and \"will avoid\n\nwhen possible and proper a construction which is unreasonable, inequitable, and\n\noppressive.\" Frost Nat'IBank, 165 S.W.3dat312 (quoting Reilly v. RangersMgmt.,\n\n                                           13\n\fInc., 727 S.W.2d 527, 530 (Tex. 1987)). If, after the pertinent rules of construction\n\nare applied, the contract can be given a definite or certain legal meaning, it is\n\nunambiguous, and we construe it as a matter of law. Id.\n\n       Both parties agree that the leases had expired, and that the parties had not\n\nexecuted new leases or a renewal of the leases, when Potter informed Clear Channel\n\nthat he was exercising his option to purchase the sign structures and permits under the\n\nterms ofthe leases. Both parties assert that paragraph three ofthe leases, pertaining\n\nto such option to purchase, is unambiguous, although they construe the provision\n\ndifferently.8\n\n      We agree that the disputed language is unambiguous and so determined\n\nrecently in another appeal before us involving three additional leases between Potter\n\nand National, containing identical language and executed on the same day as the\n\nleases at issue in this appeal.9 InNational Advertising Co. v. Potter, we decided that\n\nlanguage identicalto that before us in this appeal provided Potter the option to\n\npurchase sign structures and permits when the leases expired at the end of their\n\nnatural terms.    See No. 01-06-01042-CV, 2008 WL 920338, at *5-7 (Tex.\n\n\n\n      The mere fact that parties may disagree about the construction of a contract\n      provision does not render it ambiguous. See Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v.\n      Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 727 (Tex. 1981).\n\n      Apart from the particular tract ofproperty affected by each lease, the leases in\n      National Advertising were identical to those before us.\n                                          14\n\fApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] Apr. 3, 2008, pet. denied) (memo op.). We held that the\n\nleases were not ambiguous and that the word \"terminate,\" as used in the leases,\n\nincluded the expiration of the lease term. Id. at *6-7. In so holding, we explained\n\nthat\n\n\n              [examining paragraph three and giving its terms their generally\n       accepted meaning, it is clear that the parties intended that, in the event\n       that a specific sign or location became useless by the occurrence of one\n       of various specified situations, National was granted the right to\n       immediatelyterminateits Leaseofthe specificlocation. Paragraph three\n       grants Potter the option to purchase the sign structures and permits from\n       National, \"[i]n the event ofsuch cancellation.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n              However, paragraph three contemplates a second situation in\n       which Potter is granted the option to purchase the signs and permits\n       from National: \"in the event this lease is terminated for any reason and\n       theparties have not executed a new lease or renewal of this Lease.'\"\n       Paragraph three also governs in the event that the Leases are terminated\n       \"for any reason\" and the parties do not execute a new lease or a\n       \"renewal.\" Use of the term \"renewal\" naturally contemplates an\n       expiration. That the parties could have intended the circumstance in\n       which one party prematurely terminates the Lease and then \"renews\" it\n       is not a reasonable interpretation. Hence, the parties must have intended\n       \"terminated,\" as used within the Leases, to include expiration .... The\n       term[] \"terminated\"... include[s] the expiration of the Leases on their\n       natural terms . . . .\n\n\nId.\n\n\n       Clear Channel contends that there are material differences between National\n\nAdvertising and this cause and cites to different evidence before the trial court in the\n\nmotions for summaryjudgment at issue and the fact that, in NationalAdvertising, the\n\nparties presented an agreed statement of facts and filed an agreed motion for\n\n                                           15\n\fjudgment based on the agreed facts. Clear Channel argues that extrinsic evidence\n\npresented to the trial court in this cause—evidence related to the negotiations in the\n\noriginal signing of the leases in 1997 and to the attempts to renew the leases in\n\n2005—supports upholding the trial court's ruling, even though such ruling implicitly\n\nconstrues the contract contrary to our interpretation ofthe same language in National\n\nAdvertising. Clear Channel further argues that it is proper for us to consider the\n\n\"circumstances surrounding the execution of an unambiguous contract\" when\n\ninterpreting that contract, citing to CityofPinehurst v. Spooner Addition Water Co.,\n\n432 S.W.2d 515 (Tex. 1968).\n\n      Clear Channel has misconstrued the holding ofPinehurst. A reviewing court\n\nmayconsiderthe surrounding circumstances10 presentat thetime thatthe contractwas\n\nentered into in order to determine whether the contract is ambiguous, but, once a\n\nreviewing court decides that a contact is unambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be not\n\nbe utilized to determine the parties' intent. See Nat'I Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI\n\nIndus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520-22 (Tex. 1995); Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v.\n\nMadeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 731-32 (Tex. 1981). Because we have determined that\n\nthe language at issue is unambiguous, we do not consider the proffered extrinsic\n\n\n10    For example, extrinsic evidence ofthe \"trade usage\" meaning ofa term within\n      a particular industry may be considered in determining whether that term has\n      a definite or certain legal meaning for the purpose of the contract. See Nat'I\n      Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBIIndus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 521 n.6 (Tex. 1995).\n\n                                         16\n\fevidence in interpreting the unambiguous language of the leases at issue.\"\n\n      After reviewing the summaryjudgment motions and responses in this case, and\n\nthe accompanying evidence to the extent that it may be considered, we determine that\n\nour previous interpretation of the same language, in identical leases, signed by the\n\nsame parties, on the same day, should govern our interpretation of the leases before\n\nus in this appeal. We conclude, for the reasons set out in our opinion in National\n\nAdvertising, that paragraph three of the leases is not ambiguous and declare that,\n\nunder its terms, Potter had an option to purchase the entire sign structure and permit\n\nwhich was the subject of each lease upon the expiration of the lease term.\n\nB.    Waiver\n\n\n      Clear Channel's final ground for summary judgment was its affirmative\n\ndefense that, ifPotter had an effective option to purchase, he had waived that option\n\nbecause discussions continued between Potter and Clear Channel about possible\n\nrenewal ofthe leases after the date that the leases expired and after the date on which\n\nPotter had attempted to exercise his option to purchase. As evidence for this ground,\n\nClear Channel cited its own attempts to contact Potter in order to renew the leases,\n\nPotter's August 29 forwarding of proposed renewal leases in response to Clear\n\n\n\n\n1]    We note, however, that the circumstances surrounding both the leases at issue\n      in National Advertising, and those in the present case, were exactly the same\n      because both sets of contracts were executed between the same parties on the\n      same day under the same circumstances.\n                                          17\n\fChannel's overture to Potter on August 25, and a September 30 email from a\n\nrepresentative of Clear Channel to Potter, in which the representative mentioned\n\nspeaking to Potter and proposed certain terms for renewal of the leases.\n\n      \"The affirmative defense of waiver can be asserted against a party who\n\nintentionally relinquishes a known right or engages in intentional conduct\n\ninconsistent with claiming that right.\" Tenneco, Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., 925\n\nS.W.2d 640, 643 (Tex. 1996). In order to be entitled to a summary judgment on\n\nwaiver, Clear Channel had to establish conclusively each element ofthis affirmative\n\ndefense. See Sci. Spectrum, 941 S.W.2d at 911. Therefore, Clear Channel was\n\nrequired to establish conclusively that Potter had either (1) expressly waived his\n\noption to purchase or (2) engaged in conduct inconsistent with his option to purchase.\n\nSee Tenneco, 925 S.W.2d at 643.\n\n      Clear Channel did not do so. There is no evidence in the record that Potter\n\nexpressly waived his option to purchase, and the evidence offered on this matter does\n\nnot conclusively establish an implied intent on the part of Potter to waive his option\n\nto purchase. \"Waiver is largely a matter ofintent, and for implied waiver to be found\n\nthrough a party's actions, intent must be clearly demonstrated by the surrounding\n\nfacts and circumstances.'' Jernigan v. Langley, 111 S.W.3d 153,156 (Tex. 2003). In\n\norder to establish waiver by conduct, the conduct must be \"unequivocally\n\ninconsistent\" with claiming a known right. Van Indep. Sch. Dist. v. McCarty, 165\n\n\n                                          18\n\fS.W.3d 351, 353 (Tex. 2005).       The evidence on summary judgment does not\n\nconclusively establish that Potter engaged in \"clear, unequivocal, and decisive acts\"\n\nevidencing the intention to waive his option to purchase. See Estes v. Wilson, 682\n\nS.W.2d 711,714 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1984, writ ref d n.r.e.) (\"It is an established\n\nrule of law that to prove an implied waiver of a legal right, there must be a clear,\n\nunequivocal and decisive act of a party showing a purpose or acts which amount to\n\nestoppel on his part.\"). We hold that Clear Channel did not meet its burden to be\n\nentitled to summary judgment on the affirmative defense of waiver.12\n\nC.    Resolution\n\n\n      Having concluded that, under the unambiguous language ofparagraph three of\n\nthe leases, Potter had an option to purchase the entire sign structure and permit that\n\nwas the subject of each lease upon the expiration of the lease term, and, having\n\ndetermined that Clear Channel did not conclusively establish that Potter waived his\n\noption to purchase the sign structures and permits, we hold that Clear Channel was\n\nnot entitled to the summary judgment requested. We sustain Potter's first issue.\n\n                    Potter's Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his second issue, Potter asserts that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion for summary judgment. As previously detailed, in his summary judgment\n\n\n\n\n12    Neither Potter nor Clear Channel sought a declaratory judgment on the\n      question of waiver and so we make no declaration on this matter.\n                                          19\n\fmotion, Potter sought two declarations from the trial court: (1) that Clear Channel had\n\nexercised its right of first refusal by rejecting Potter's proposed lease agreement and\n\n(2) that Potter was entitled to exercise his option to purchase sign structures and\n\npermits from Clear Channel. He also sought attorney's fees.\n\n      We have already determined that the leases provided Potter an option to\n\npurchase the sign structures and permits upon the expiration of the leases,and,\n\nthereforevwe hold that Potter was entitled to summary judgment declaring that he had\n\nsuch an option. Our resolution ofPotter's other question in his declaratory judgment\n\naction—whether Clear Channel had exercised its right of first refusal—is likewise\n\nguided by our opinion in National Advertising. In that case, when deciding whether\n\nNational had exercised its right of first refusal under an identical paragraph nine as\n\nin the leases before us, we stated, \"Here, National declined to renew the Leases on the\n\nterms offered by Potter in his August 25, 2005 correspondence. Hence, National\n\nexercised its right of first refusal when it rejected Potter's offer.\" Nat 'lAdver., 2008\n\nWL 920338, at *4. For the same reasons stated in that opinion, we declare that Clear\n\nChannel exercised its right of first refusal when it declined to renew the leases under\n\nthe terms offered by Potter to Clear Channel in the letter mailed on August 29,2005.\n\n      However, as to the issue ofattorney's fees, Potter's summary judgment sought\n\nrecovery ofhis attorney's fees and costs for both the declaratory judgment claim and\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fhis quantum meruit claim,13 and the evidence provided to the trial court did not\n\ndistinguish between fees related to each distinct claim.14 Potter may not recover\n\nattorney's fees and costs for the quantum meruit claim on which he did not prevail or\n\nrecover damages. See Green Int'l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 390 (Tex. 1997).\n\nAdditionally, any \"award [of] costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as\n\nare equitable and just\" in a declaratory judgment action is within the discretion ofthe\n\ntrial court. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 2008).\n\n      The trial court presumably did not award attorney's fees or costs to Potter\n\nbecause it denied his motion for summary judgment on his declaratory judgment\n\nclaim. Because we have reversed the trial court's denial of Potter's summary\n\n\n13\n      Potter's summary judgment motion specified that he was seeking attorney's\n      fees and costs \"pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 37.001 et. seq. and\n      [sic] Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 38.011, et. seq.\" The first reference is clearly\n      seeking recovery for attorney's fees related to his declaratory judgment action.\n      See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 2008) (permitting\n      trial court to award \"costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are\n      equitable and just\" in action for declaratory judgment). The second seems to\n      be an attempt to recover attorney's fees related to the quantum meruit claim.\n      See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001 (Vernon 2008) (permitting\n      recovery for attorney's fees and costs for variety of claims, including claims\n      as to rendered services, performed labor, furnished material, or oral or written\n      contract).\n14\n      See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299,313-14 (Tex. 2006)\n      (reaffirming rule that ifany attorney's fees relate solely to claim for which fees\n      are unrecoverable, claimant must segregate recoverable fees from\n      unrecoverable fees, and holding that remand required when fees not segregated\n      and at least some of attorney's fees are attributable only to claims for which\n      fees are not recoverable).\n\n                                          21\n\fjudgment, because we have declared in his favor the issues before the trial court for\n\ndeclaratory judgment,and because anyawardfor costsand reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney's fees \"as are equitable and just\" in a declaratory judgment action is\n\ndiscretionary, we conclude that cause should be remand to the trial court for it to\n\nconsider the issue of Potter's attorney's fees and costs on his declaratory judgment.\n\n      We sustain Potter's second issue.\n\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n\n      We reverse the trial court's judgment in part, affirm the judgment in part, and\n\nremand this cause with instructions. We reverse the judgment to the extent that it\n\nrendered summary judgment for Clear Channel and implicitly granted a declaratory\n\njudgment for Clear Channel. We affirm the judgment to the extent that it implicitly\n\nrendered a take-nothing judgment against Potter on his quantum meruit claim. We\n\nremand this cause to the trial court with instructionsto render a declaratoryjudgment\n\nin favor ofPotter consistent with this opinion and to consider Potter's request for the\n\naward of attorney's fees and costs under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nsection 37.009.

Clear Channel Outdoors, Inc. (Tex. App.-Houston (1st Dist.) Jul. 2, 2009)(Taft).\nSee Appendix (1) for a 23-page copy of this authority.\n\n(d) Statement of the Case (Pursuant rule 38.1)\n\nThis case is an appeal by Appellant, Mr. Neira, of a summary judgment filed by the City.\n\nOn March 28, 2014, Mr. Neira, filed this suit in District Court pursuant Chapter 37\nDeclaratory Judgment of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code asking the trial\ncourt to interpret Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance to settle a controversy. There is\nno claim by Appellant of damages.\n\nOn September 14, 2014 the trial court rendered a summary judgment in favor ofthe City.\n\nOn January 23,2015, the Court ofAppeals issued an order accepting this\njurisdiction ofthis case and requesting Appellant's reply within 30 days.\n(e) Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\nAppellant does not request time for an oral argument, but is available ifthe Court of\nAppeals or theAppellee requests an oral argument.\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\f(f) Issues Presented\n\nThe primary issue is that the trial court erred because The Declaratory Judgments Act\nprohibits a summary judgment if there is \"real and substantial controversy that can be\nsettled by a declaratory judgment\". Controversy exists because the City, in its October 7,\n2013 letter, argues that replat of 3019 Knight Robin is valid based on the City's\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance. See October 7, 2013 City letter,\nin appendix in this Appeal, or, as exhibit 2 in Mr. Neira's original petition. Mr. Neira\nargues that the replat is not valid, based on his interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1).\n\nAnother issue is that the trial court erred in its September 14, 2014 summary judgment\nbecause interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1) of City Ordinance an issue of material\nfact, especially if Mr. Neira had requested a trial by jury. The evidence is Section 35-\n515(h)(1) of City ordinance.\n\nAnother issue is protecting public interest. Appellant strongly believes that proper\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(l) of City Ordinance will protect home owners\nthroughout the city of San Antonio, especially from water diversion damage and invasion\nof back-yard privacy. Long drive ways of flag-lots create car traffic in neighbors' back\nyards, which previously, had privacy. Proper interpretation by the City of its City\nOrdinances will help promote government integrity. For example, a September 20, 2013\nExpress-News article described indictment of a former official of the City's Planning and\nDevelopment Services Department for running a business that sold expedited building\npermits. Proper interpretation of City Ordinances by City officials will simplify replat\nand building permit applications and reduce the need for expedited services.\n\n(g) Statement of Facts (in chronological order)\n\nIn the middle of May 2013, Mr. Neira received a City notice titled \"Notice of Pubic\nHearing by the San Antonio Planning Commission\" (See Appendix for a copy). Mr.\nNeira telephoned Ms. Donna Camacho, who was listed on the notice, to ask if his\ntestimony at the May 22, 2013 public hearing would influence the May 22, 2013 replat\ndecision. Mr. Neira was told that his appearance at the hearing would not change the\ndecision and therefore, Mr. Neira did not attend. Mr. Neira reviewed the replat of 3019\nKnight Robin, whichwas attached to the notice of public hearing on May 22, 2013. He\nbecame concerned about reduction of privacy in his back yard and in potential flooding in\nhis back yard and in the neighborhood. Mr. Neira had had flooding of his house and is\nfamiliar with flooding in his neighborhood. Mr. Neira noticed thatthe new replat of 3019\nKnight Robin allowed for two new homes inthe back yard ofthe existing home at 3019\nKnight Robin, two new homes inthe back yard ofthe original lot at 3019 Knight Robin\nwould have access to the street(Knight Robin Drive) with 20-foot drive ways. Mr. Neira\nis aware of zoning requirements, such as 40-foot minimum street frontage in most\nneighborhoods in San Antonio.\n\n\nAppellant's(Neira's) Brief\n\fOn August 1, 2013, Mr. Neira visited the City's over-the-counter service office at 1901 S.\nAlamo Street to ask about City zoning for his neighborhood. The City over-the-counter\nperson was surprised when Mr. Neira mentioned that his neighbor at 3019 Knight Robin\nwas able to replat his one-acre lot into lots that included 20-foot street frontage lots. The\nCity over-the-counter person gave Mr. Neira a copy of zoning ordinance section 35-353,\nwhich requires 40-foot minimum street frontage for new lots in replats in Mr. Neira's\nneighborhood. She also gave Mr. Neira a copy of a new City ordinance, section 35-515,\nwhich allows back yard lots (flag lots) under certain conditions. Mr. Neira read the new\nsection 35-515 City ordinance and concluded that if certain conditions are not met, flag\nlots (back yard lots) must be approved by at a City variance board in order to be valid.\nThe lot at 3019 Kinght Robin was replatted without a variance board hearing.\n\nOn March 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed \"Plaintiffs Original Petition for Declaratory\nJudgment\" asking that the trial court declare the Planning Commission's May 22, 2013\nreplat of 3019 Knight Robin invalid, based on the Court's interpretation of Section 35-\n515(h)(l)of City ordinance, and based on no variance board hearing being held.\n\nThe City filed motions for discovery and Mr. Neira replied.\n\nOn or about August 14, 2014, the City's attorney filed a motion for summary judgment\narguing that Mr. Neira did not raise a genuine issue of material fact and that Mr. Neira\ndid not provide evidence, along with other claims. The City's request for summary\njudgment is titled \"Defendant Sheryl Sculley's Motion for Summary Judgment\"; and,\nconsists of an 18-page brief and a 93-page attachment.\n\nOn August 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed a reply to the City's request for summaryjudgment.\nMr. Neira's reply is titled \"Plaintiffs Response to Defendant's Summary Judgment and\nMotion for Summary Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff'. Mr. Neira's reply consists of a 6-\npage brief and a 20-page attachment.\n\nOn page 2 of his reply, Mr. Neira states as follows: There is real and substantial\ncontroversy that can be settled by a declaratory judgment.\"\n\nOn page 6, Mr. Neira states as follows:\n\"If the court agrees that Section 35-515(h)(l) of City ordinance is an exception that was\nnot met, and, that flag lots are not allowed, then Plaintiffrequests (prays) that the Court\ndeclare the following:\n\n    1. Thatthe City of SanAntonio's May 22, 2013 replat of 3019 Knight Robin is void\n       and judicially invalid because the replat allows for flag lots and the replat does not\n       meetstatutory requirements of Section 212 of the Local Government Code.\n\n\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\fAs evidence, Mr. Neira's reply included an 11-page copy of Section 35.515 of City\nOrdinance. The 11-page copy is titled Exhibit 4 in Mr. Neira's reply to summary\njudgment.\n\nOn September 12, 2014, Mr. Neira and the City's attorney attended a summary judgment\nhearing. On September 14, 2014 the presiding judge signed a summary judgmentin favor\nof the City.\n\nOn January 23, 2015 the Court of Appeals requested a Brief within thirty (30) days\nafter the date of the January 23, 2015 Order.\n\nWith this \"Appellant's Brief, Mr. Neira appeals the September 14, 2014 summary\njudgment decision.\n\n(h) Summary of Argument\n\nAppellant argued in his original petition before the trial court, and, Appellant still argues\nwith this appeal, that a substantial issue of controversy exists that can be settled with the\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act. The trial court erred because The Declaratory\nJudgments Act prohibits a summary judgment if there is real and substantial controversy\nthat can be settled by a declaratory judgment. Controversy exists because the City argues\nthat replat of 3019 Knight Robin is valid basedon its interpretation of Section 35-\n515(h)(1) of City ordinance. Mr. Neira argues that the replat is not valid, based on his\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1).\n\nThe City argued with its summary judgment that Mr. Neira did not raise an issue of\nmaterial fact and that Mr. Neira did not provide evidence. To this, Mr. Neira argues that\ninterpretation of Section 35-515(h)(l) is an issue of fact, especially if Mr. Neira had\nrequested a trial by jury. Section 35-515(h)(1) is the evidence.\n\n (i) Argument\n\nOn March 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed his suit under Section 37.004 Declaratory Judgments\nof Civil Practices and Remedies Code (Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act). The\nDeclaratory Judgments Actprovides for a trial on merits for Mr. Neira's claim thatthe\nreplat of 3019 Knight Robin is invalid. Declaration of rights under Section 37.004\ninclude rights under \"municipal ordinance\".\n\nOn or about August 14, 2014, the City's attorney filed a motion for summary judgment\narguing that Mr. Neira did not raise a genuine issue ofmaterial fact and that Mr. Neira\ndid not provide sufficient evidence, along with other claims.\n\nOn August 28, 2014, Mr. Neira filed a reply to the City's request for summary judgment.\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\fIn his reply, Mr. Neira states that there is real and substantial controversy that can be\nsettled by a declaratory judgment. The City argues thatthe replat of 3019 Knight Robin\nis valid based on its interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance. Mr. Neira\nargues that the replat is not valid, based on his interpretation of Section 35-515(h)(1).\nMr. Neira argues that the replat is not valid because it does not meet either of the two\nexceptions in Section 35-515. Mr. Neira argues that in order for the lot at 3019 Knight\nRobin to qualify for replat under Section 35-515(h)(l), the lot at 3019 Knight Robin must\nhave been a lot with physical limitations or must have been a site with physical\nlimitation. Mr. Neira argues that 3019 Knight Robin did have a physical limitation and\ndid not qualify for flag lots without a variance hearing. Since no variance board hearing\nwas held, any new lot at 3019 Knight Robin must comply with the 40-foot minimum\nstreet frontage of normal zoning in section 35-353 of City ordinance.\n\nIn his reply to summaryjudgment, Mr. Neira states as follows:\n\"Ifthe court agrees that Section 35-515(h)(1) of City ordinance is an exception that was\nnot met, and, thatflag lots are not allowed, then Plaintiff'requests (prays) that the Court\ndeclare thefollowing:\n\n   1. That the City ofSan Antonio's May 22, 2013 replat of3019 Knight Robin is void\n      andjudicially invalid because the replat allowsforflag lots and the replat does\n      not meet statutory requirements ofSection 212 ofthe Local Government Code.''''\n\nLarry E Potter, Appellant v. Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc, Appellee is relevant inthis case.\nIn the Larry Potter case, the Court of Appeals for the First District in Texas interpreted a\ncontract to determine if a summary judgment rendered by the trial court was in error.\nThe Court of Appeals for theFirst District in Texas determined thatthetrial court erred\nin its interpretation ofthe contract, and remanded the case to the trial court. The appeal\ncourt states in part. \"We remand this cause to the trial court with instructions to render a\ndeclaratoryjudgment infavor ofPotter consistent with this opinion and to consider\nPotter's requestfor the award ofattorney 'sfeesand cost under Texas Civil Practice and\nRemedies Code section 37.009.\"\n\nIf the Court of Appeals reads Section 35-515(h)(l) of City ordinance and agrees with Mr.\nNeira, that exceptions in this section are not met for the \"automatic\" replat of 3019\nKnight Robin, then a City Variance Board hearing is required. The replat then is invalid\nbecause a variance board hearing was not held within the required time. An unlawful plat\nor replat is violation ofSection 212.010(4) ofTexas Local Government Code.\n\n(j) Prayer\n\nMr. Neira asks that the Appeal Court render a declaratory judgment in favor of Mr.\nNeira-that the May 22, 2013 replat of3019 Knight Robin is invalid because Section 35-\n\nAppellant's (Neira's) Brief\n\f515 of City ordinance does not allowthe replat without a timely City Variance Board\nhearing, and a City Variance Board hearing was not held. The City is in violation of\nSection 212.010(4) of Texas Local Government Code.\n\nAs an alternative, Mr. Neira asks the Court of Appeals remand this case for a trial court\ndecision on Mr. Neira's request for declaratory judgment.\n\nMr. Neira' Affidavit\n\n\nMr. Neira is the Plaintiff, pro se, and makes this affidavitthat he is competentto testify in\nthis case, that he has personal knowledge of this case, that he is over age 18, and, that his\nstatements above are correct to the best of his knowledge.\n\nCertificate of Service\n\n\nMr. Neira certifies that his above-titled Notice was served by regular mail and by\ncertified mail to the Appellee's attorney and to co Appellee, Mr. Hovenden as listed\nbelow:\n\n\nFitzpatrick & Kosanovich, PC (Attorney for Appellee)\nPO Box 831121\nSan Antonio, TX 78283-1121\n\nRichard Hovenden, (prior defendant)\n3019 Knight Robin Dr.\nSan Antonio, TX 78209\n(3019 Knight Robin Dr. is located next door east of 3015 Knight Robin Dr.)\n\nOn this the //^fi day of FsJ/^fi^, 2015\nRudy Neira, Appellant, Pro Se            Date\n210 564-3634 office\n\n Appellant's Brief Respectfully Submitted,\n(yt<lJhL 9^U^^                      fab //,^/jT\nRudy Neira, Appellant, Pro Se          Date:\n3015 Knight Robin Dr.\nSan Antonio, TX 78209                210 564-3634 office\n\n\n\n\nAppellant's(Neira's) Brief\n\f       (k) Appendix in Civil Cases\n       (1) Necessary contents\n(A)Trial court's judgment: one page                                               1 page\n(B) Jury charge, conclusion of law: not applicable                                Non jury\n(C) The text of any rule, regulation, ordinance, statute, constitutional\nprovision, or other law (excluding case law) on which the argument is based,\nand the text of any contract or other document that is central to the argument:\n\n   (1) October 7, 2013 city letter central to the argument                        lpage\n   (2) May 22, 2013 Notice of Public Hearing by City Planning Commission          2 pages\n   (3) City ordinance section 35-515 (h)                                          11 pages\n   (4) City ordinance section 35-353                                              2 pages\n   (5) Chapter 37 Declaratory Judgments                                           4 pages\n   (6) Potter v.

Please know that staff\n attempted to contact you by phone on August 29, 2013 and September 3, 2013. However, we were\n unable to reach you or leave a message for a return call. Eventually, on October 3, 2013 staff did reach\n you to discuss yourconcerns regarding the platted property.\n\n         As you are aware, the Development Services Department reviewed your letters and appreciates\n your concerns for your neighborhood. Staff re-evaluated the plat approved by the Planning Commission\n on May 22, 2013 and subsequently recorded at the Bexar County Courthouse on June 14, 2013. Please\n understand, this plat meets the development regulations of the Unified Development Code (UDC) and\n therefore, rescinding of the plat is not applicable.\n\n        As you stated in your letter, NP8 zoning requires a minimum lot frontage of 40 feet in accordance\n with UDC Section 35-353 Neighborhood Preservation District. However, the flag lot provision in the\n UDC, Section 35-515(h)(1) Flag Lots, specifically supersedes Section 35-353 and allows for reduced\n frontage for flag lots. Furthermore, the requirement for the applicant to seek a variance through the Board\n of Adjustments and Appeals was not applicable in this situation. Additionally, you point out that two\n additional lots on Vandiver were subdivided. Please be aware these lots also meet the standard of the\n provision noted above regarding flag lots.\n\n         Regarding the property located at.3011 Knight Robin, Section 35-371(b) of the UDC allows for\n the construction of an accessory dwelling structure on the property. Also, this property was created by\n the replatting of a portion of Lot 3 to establish Lot 17, consequently leaving a remaining portion of Lot 3.\n Since then, the remaining portion of Lot 3 was divided by metes and,bounds survey and sold to two\n separate owners with the addresses of 3015 Knight Robin and 7214 Vandiver. State Law and the UDC\n require owners of lots created by survey, who require building permits in the future, be subject to\n replatting requirements in accordance with the UDC.\n\n If you need further assistance regarding theseissues, please do not hesitate to contact our office.\n Sincerely,\n\n\nclohn/P.

Standards areprovided to ensure that lots have adequate\n      access and conform to the zoning provisions of this chapter. The city finds and determines that long blocks\n      lined with homes andother buildings reduce streetconnectivity and impair the efficiency of public and safety\n      services, while increasing distances between residences andnonresidential destinations orpublic gathering\n      places. Exceptions to these standards aremade for non-urban districts and zoning districts (such as \"RP\" and\n      \"RE\") and districts which require greaterflexibility in order to encourage economic development(such as \"1-1\"\n      and \"1-2\").\n\n\n\n\nhttp://libraty.mimicode.com/HTML/14228/level2/ARTVDEST_DIV4LOLAHEDEINST.htm                                 1/23/2014\n\fDIVISION 4.

Vehicular access to nonresidential uses must be by public street, private street,\n                          or an irrevocable ingress/egress easement as specified under subsection 35-515(c)(4)\n                          and shall not utilize any property that is zoned single-family residential. However,\n                          pedestrian access may be provided by means of a dedicated easement or access way to\n                          promote pedestrian circulation on residentially zoned property and/or by means of a public\n                          or private street.\n                  (6)     Prohibition Against Creating Landlocked Conditions. Plat applicants shall ensure that\n                          there is no abutting landlock conditions created by the proposed plat.\n          (d)     Driveways. Restrictionson driveway areas are designed to avoid the domination of front yards\n                  by large expanses of impervious surfaces which deaden the streetscape and discourage\n                  pedestrian activity. Reducing the width of driveways can reduce total site imperviousness. Some\n                  techniques that can be used include:\n                  0)      Driveways and other impervious surfaces shall not comprise more than the percentage of\n                          the front yard as specified in column (B) for the use patterns or zoning districts designated\n                          in column (A). Driveway entrances shall not comprise more than the percentage of the\n                          front lot line as designated in column (B). Parking may be provided in the rear yard, and\n                          access may be provided through alleys, where the front yard is insufficient to\n                          accommodate a driveway.

Potter, appeals a judgment rendered upon a motion for\n\nsummaryjudgment filedby appellee,ClearChannelOutdoor, Inc. (\"Clear Channel\"),\n\fin a dispute concerning the construction oflease agreements. We determine whether\n\nthe trial court erred in granting Clear Channel's motion for traditional summary\n\njudgment and in denying Potter's motion for traditional summary judgment. We\n\nreverse the trial court's judgment in part, affirm the judgment in part, and remand this\n\ncause with instructions.\n\n\n                                    Background\n\n      In 1997, National Advertising Company (\"National\"), a predecessor in interest\n\nto Clear Channel, and Potter executed 10 identical1 ground leases, six of which are\n\nthe subject of this appeal. The leases were for a 10-year term, with an effective\n\nstarting date of August 1, 1995. Pursuant to each lease, National was permitted to\n\nerect billboard signs on tracts of land belonging to Potter in exchange for the greater\n\nof a fixed monthly rental or a percentage of the gross income that National derived\n\nfrom selling advertising space on the billboard signs. Under paragraph nine of each\n\nlease, \"at the termination of the lease,\" National had a \"right of first refusal\" to\n\ncontinue to rent the land if Potter chose further to rent or to use his land for outdoor\n\nadvertising. This right expired one month \"after the lease expire[d].\" Paragraph three\n\nofeach lease also gave National, under certain conditions, the right to \"terminate this\n\nlease\" and provided Potter the option to purchase the entire sign structures and\n\n\n\n1     The leases differed only with regard to the tract of property affected.\n                                           2\n\fpermits from National \"[i]n the event of such cancellation or in the event this lease\n\nis terminated for any reason and the parties have not executed a new lease or renewal\n\nof this Lease.\"\n\n\n      During the term of the leases, Clear Channel purchased six signs from a\n\npredecessor outdoor advertising company, and those six leases were assigned to Clear\n\nChannel.2 Clear Channel did not succeed in contacting Potter regarding renewal of\n\nits leases before their expiration date of July 31, 2005. On August 1, 2005, Clear\n\nChannel sent the usual lease payments to Potter, but Potter returned the checks by a\n\nletter dated August 25, 2005, in which he noted that Clear Channel's leases had\n\nexpired by their own terms on July 31,2005, and that he was \"declining to extend the\n\nground leases for an additional one (1) year term on a holdover basis.\" On August\n\n25, 2005, a representative of Clear Channel reached Potter, and they discussed\n\nrenewing the leases. On August 29,2005, Potter forwarded proposed renewal leases\n\nto Clear Channel, which Clear Channel received the following day. On September\n\n1,2005, Potter sent Clear Channel a letter informing Clear Channel that he intended\n\nto exercise his right to purchase the sign structures and permits, with the purchase\n\nprice to be decided pursuant to the \"terms of the ground lease.\"\n\n\n      Three of the remaining leases were also the subject of litigation and of a\n      separate appeal before this Court.

If at any time the\n             highway view of [National's (later, Clear Channel's)] displays is\n             obstructed or obscured, or the use or installation of such displays\n             is prevented or restricted by law or by [National's (later, Clear\n             Channel's)] inability to obtain or maintain any necessary permits\n             or licenses, or if there occurs a diversion of traffic from, or a\n             change in the direction of traffic on highways leading past\n             [National's (later, Clear Channel's)] displays, [National (later,\n             Clear Channel)] may, at its option, terminate this lease as to such\n             specific location by giving 30 days written notice to [Potter]. In\n             the event of such cancellation or in the event this lease is\n             terminated for any reason and the parties have not executed a new\n             lease or renewal of this Lease, [Potter] shall have the option to\n             purchase the entire sign structure and permits from [National\n             (later, Clear Channel)] for the then current market value of an\n             installed fabricated structure, such value to be determined by the\n             average ofthree (3) bids to be obtained from three (3) major sign\n             fabricators.\n\fnegotiate renewal leases with Potter after this letter, but expressed to Potter that it had\n\nproblems with the language of the proposed renewal leases, and suggested alternate\n\nterms.\n\n\n         On October 18,2005, Potter filed suit against Clear Channel. Potter sought (1)\n\na temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and permanent injunction\n\npreventing Clear Channel fromremoving the billboards; (2) ajudgment in the amount\n\nequal to the fair market value for the use of the billboards on his properties beyond\n\nthe contractual period under the theory of quantum meruit; and (3) a declaratory\n\njudgment that Clear Channel had exercised its right of first refusal under paragraph\n\nnine by declining to accept the terms of Potter's proposed renewal leases and that\n\nPotter was therefore entitled to exercisehis right to purchase the entire sign structures\n\nand permits from Clear Channel for the current market value ofan installed fabricated\n\nstructure. He also prayed for recovery of his attorney's fees and costs.\n\n         Clear Channel filed an answer that generally denied the allegations in Potter's\n\npetition, raised the affirmative defenses of waiver and ambiguity, and contained a\n\ncounterclaim for declaratory judgment. In its counterclaim, Clear Channel sought\n\ndeclarations (1) that in order for the option to purchase under paragraph 3 to become\n\neffective, the lease must have \"actually been terminated\"; (2) that the leases had not\n\nterminated, but had expired; and (3) that therefore Potter did not have an option to\n\fpurchase the signs. It also sought to recover its attorney's fees and costs.\n\n       Potter filed a motion for traditional summary judgment on his declaratory\n\njudgment claim only; while that motion was still pending, Clear Channel filed its own\n\nmotion for summary judgment that also addressed only the declaratory judgment\n\nclaims. Neither motion addressed the quantummeruit claim in Potter's petition, and\n\nClear Channel's motion did not address Potter's claim for attorney's fees and costs.4\n\n       Potter's motion for traditional summary judgment sought declarations that\n\n(1)Clear Channel hadexercised itsright offirst refusal byrejecting Potter'sproposed\n\nlease agreement and (2) Potter was entitled to exercise his option to purchase sign\n\nstructures andpermits from Clear Channel. Asgrounds forhis motion, Potterargued\n\nthat\n\n\n       (1)   Clear Channel's rejection of the terms of Potter's proposed\n             renewal lease agreements was an exercise of its right of first\n             refusal under paragraph nine of the leases and Clear Channel\n             could no longer accept Potter's offer to extend the lease\n             agreements and\n\n       (2)   Potter was entitled to exercise his right to purchase the entire sign\n             structures and permits pursuant to the terms ofparagraph three of\n             the Leases, because such paragraph gave him the option to\n             purchase \"in the event [that the] lease [was] terminated for any\n             reason and the parties [had] not executed a new lease or renewal\n             of the lease.\" Potter asserted that because the leases had expired\n             and there were no new leases or renewal of the prior leases\n\n\n       Potter's injunctive reliefrequests were resolved by way ofa rule 11 agreement\n       between the parties.\n\f             between the parties, his option to purchase became effective.\n\nIn addition to a declaratory judgment in his favor, Potter sought recovery of his\n\nattorney's fees and costs.\n\n      In its motion for traditional summary judgment, Clear Channel also pursued a\n\njudicial declaration interpreting paragraph three of the leases. Clear Channel's\n\nmotiondid not specifywhetherClearChannel was moving for summaryjudgment on\n\nits declaratory judgment counterclaim, or attempting to defeat Potter's declaratory\n\njudgment claim, or both, although language in the motion suggested the last.5 As its\n\ngrounds for the grant of its summary judgment, Clear Channel argued that\n\n      (1)    the Leaseswerenot ambiguous and Potterhad no effectiveoption\n             to purchase because the leases had \"expired,\" rather than\n             \"terminated,\" and paragraph three provided Potter the option to\n             purchase only upon the \"termination\" of the lease\n\n      (2)    alternatively, the leases were ambiguous and should be construed\n             against Potter and the leases should be construed to mean that the\n             option to purchase did not arise in the event of the expiration of\n             the leases, but only on their termination; and\n\n      (3)    alternatively, Potter had waived any option to purchase because\n             discussions continued between Potter and Clear Channel about\n             possible renewal of the leases after Potter had attempted to\n             exercise his option to purchase.\n\n      Clear Channel prayed that summary judgment be granted \"on all grounds\n\n\n\n      In a later filing, Clear Channel stated that \"both sides have filed motions for\n      summary judgment regarding their respective declarations.\"\n\fstated\" in the motion, that Potter \"take nothing on his claim against Clear Channel,\"\n\nand that the court award Clear Channel its costs of court and reasonable attorney's\n\nfees. Clear Channel also prayed that, \"if summary judgment for Clear Channel [was]\n\nnot rendered as to all of Clear Channel's claims, or for all the relief requested,\" the\n\ntrial court enter an order specifying the facts that were without substantial\n\ncontroversy.\n\n      On June 18,2007, the trial court granted Clear Channel's motion for summary\n\njudgment and denied Potter's motion for summary judgment in an order that read:\n\n      On this day came to be considered PlaintiffLarry E. Potter's Motion for\n      Summary Judgment and Defendant Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc.'s\n      Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The court, having considered the\n      motion, pleadings, responses, and summary judgment evidence hereby\n      DENIES Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment and GRANTS\n      Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n      It is therefore ORDERED that Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment\n      is DENIED and Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is\n      GRANTED.\n\n\n       On August 14, 2007, the trial court issued a final judgment, confirming the\n\ngrant ofClear Channel's motion and the denial ofPotter's motion, and denying Clear\n\nChannel's request for attorney's fees. The judgment read:\n\n      By Order dated June 18, 2007, the Court denied Plaintiff Larry E.\n      Potter's Motion for Summary Judgment and granted Defendant Clear\n      Channel Outdoor, Inc.'s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.              In\n      doing so, the Court failed to address Clear Channel's request for an\n      award of attorney's fees. Accordingly, it is\n\f     ORDERED that Defendant Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. 's request for an\n     award of attorney's fees is hereby denied.\n\n     This is a final and appealable judgment, which, in conjunction with the\n     Court's order ofJune 18,2007, disposes ofall claims and parties in this\n     cause.6\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n\n     In two issues, Potter contends that the trial court erroneously granted Clear\n\nChannel's motion for summary judgment and erroneously denied his motion for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       Both parties' motions sought summary judgments that would declare the\n\n\n     Nothing in the record indicates that Potter's quantum meruit claim for the fair\n     market value of the use of the billboards on his properties beyond the\n     contractual period was ever presented to the court for resolution either by trial,\n     summary judgment, or dismissal. However, the language of the \"final\n     judgment\" indicates that the judgment was meant to dispose of all claims and\n     all parties, and it clearly expresses the trial court's intent that the judgment be\n     final.

Paragraph three\n       grants Potter the option to purchase the sign structures and permits from\n       National, \"[i]n the event ofsuch cancellation.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n              However, paragraph three contemplates a second situation in\n       which Potter is granted the option to purchase the signs and permits\n       from National: \"in the event this lease is terminated for any reason and\n       theparties have not executed a new lease or renewal of this Lease.'\"\n       Paragraph three also governs in the event that the Leases are terminated\n       \"for any reason\" and the parties do not execute a new lease or a\n       \"renewal.\" Use of the term \"renewal\" naturally contemplates an\n       expiration. That the parties could have intended the circumstance in\n       which one party prematurely terminates the Lease and then \"renews\" it\n       is not a reasonable interpretation. Hence, the parties must have intended\n       \"terminated,\" as used within the Leases, to include expiration .... The\n       term[] \"terminated\"... include[s] the expiration of the Leases on their\n       natural terms . . . .\n\n\nId.\n\n\n       Clear Channel contends that there are material differences between National\n\nAdvertising and this cause and cites to different evidence before the trial court in the\n\nmotions for summaryjudgment at issue and the fact that, in NationalAdvertising, the\n\nparties presented an agreed statement of facts and filed an agreed motion for\n\n                                           15\n\fjudgment based on the agreed facts. Clear Channel argues that extrinsic evidence\n\npresented to the trial court in this cause—evidence related to the negotiations in the\n\noriginal signing of the leases in 1997 and to the attempts to renew the leases in\n\n2005—supports upholding the trial court's ruling, even though such ruling implicitly\n\nconstrues the contract contrary to our interpretation ofthe same language in National\n\nAdvertising. Clear Channel further argues that it is proper for us to consider the\n\n\"circumstances surrounding the execution of an unambiguous contract\" when\n\ninterpreting that contract, citing to CityofPinehurst v.

We conclude, for the reasons set out in our opinion in National\n\nAdvertising, that paragraph three of the leases is not ambiguous and declare that,\n\nunder its terms, Potter had an option to purchase the entire sign structure and permit\n\nwhich was the subject of each lease upon the expiration of the lease term.\n\nB.    Waiver\n\n\n      Clear Channel's final ground for summary judgment was its affirmative\n\ndefense that, ifPotter had an effective option to purchase, he had waived that option\n\nbecause discussions continued between Potter and Clear Channel about possible\n\nrenewal ofthe leases after the date that the leases expired and after the date on which\n\nPotter had attempted to exercise his option to purchase. As evidence for this ground,\n\nClear Channel cited its own attempts to contact Potter in order to renew the leases,\n\nPotter's August 29 forwarding of proposed renewal leases in response to Clear\n\n\n\n\n1]    We note, however, that the circumstances surrounding both the leases at issue\n      in National Advertising, and those in the present case, were exactly the same\n      because both sets of contracts were executed between the same parties on the\n      same day under the same circumstances.\n                                          17\n\fChannel's overture to Potter on August 25, and a September 30 email from a\n\nrepresentative of Clear Channel to Potter, in which the representative mentioned\n\nspeaking to Potter and proposed certain terms for renewal of the leases.\n\n      \"The affirmative defense of waiver can be asserted against a party who\n\nintentionally relinquishes a known right or engages in intentional conduct\n\ninconsistent with claiming that right.\" Tenneco, Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768079\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768079/tenneco-inc-v-enterprise-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 (Tex. 1996). In order to be entitled to a summary judgment on\n\nwaiver, Clear Channel had to establish conclusively each element ofthis affirmative\n\ndefense. See Sci. Spectrum, 941 S.W.2d at 911. Therefore, Clear Channel was\n\nrequired to establish conclusively that Potter had either (1) expressly waived his\n\noption to purchase or (2) engaged in conduct inconsistent with his option to purchase.\n\nSee Tenneco, 925 S.W.2d at 643.\n\n      Clear Channel did not do so. There is no evidence in the record that Potter\n\nexpressly waived his option to purchase, and the evidence offered on this matter does\n\nnot conclusively establish an implied intent on the part of Potter to waive his option\n\nto purchase. \"Waiver is largely a matter ofintent, and for implied waiver to be found\n\nthrough a party's actions, intent must be clearly demonstrated by the surrounding\n\nfacts and circumstances.'' Jernigan v. Langley, 111 S.W.3d 153,156 (Tex. 2003). In\n\norder to establish waiver by conduct, the conduct must be \"unequivocally\n\ninconsistent\" with claiming a known right. Van Indep. Sch.

The evidence on summary judgment does not\n\nconclusively establish that Potter engaged in \"clear, unequivocal, and decisive acts\"\n\nevidencing the intention to waive his option to purchase. See Estes v. Wilson, 682\n\nS.W.2d 711,714 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1984, writ ref d n.r.e.) (\"It is an established\n\nrule of law that to prove an implied waiver of a legal right, there must be a clear,\n\nunequivocal and decisive act of a party showing a purpose or acts which amount to\n\nestoppel on his part.\"). We hold that Clear Channel did not meet its burden to be\n\nentitled to summary judgment on the affirmative defense of waiver.12\n\nC.    Resolution\n\n\n      Having concluded that, under the unambiguous language ofparagraph three of\n\nthe leases, Potter had an option to purchase the entire sign structure and permit that\n\nwas the subject of each lease upon the expiration of the lease term, and, having\n\ndetermined that Clear Channel did not conclusively establish that Potter waived his\n\noption to purchase the sign structures and permits, we hold that Clear Channel was\n\nnot entitled to the summary judgment requested. We sustain Potter's first issue.\n\n                    Potter's Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his second issue, Potter asserts that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion for summary judgment. As previously detailed, in his summary judgment\n\n\n\n\n12    Neither Potter nor Clear Channel sought a declaratory judgment on the\n      question of waiver and so we make no declaration on this matter.\n                                          19\n\fmotion, Potter sought two declarations from the trial court: (1) that Clear Channel had\n\nexercised its right of first refusal by rejecting Potter's proposed lease agreement and\n\n(2) that Potter was entitled to exercise his option to purchase sign structures and\n\npermits from Clear Channel. He also sought attorney's fees.\n\n      We have already determined that the leases provided Potter an option to\n\npurchase the sign structures and permits upon the expiration of the leases,and,\n\nthereforevwe hold that Potter was entitled to summary judgment declaring that he had\n\nsuch an option. Our resolution ofPotter's other question in his declaratory judgment\n\naction—whether Clear Channel had exercised its right of first refusal—is likewise\n\nguided by our opinion in National Advertising. In that case, when deciding whether\n\nNational had exercised its right of first refusal under an identical paragraph nine as\n\nin the leases before us, we stated, \"Here, National declined to renew the Leases on the\n\nterms offered by Potter in his August 25, 2005 correspondence. Hence, National\n\nexercised its right of first refusal when it rejected Potter's offer.\" Nat 'lAdver., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">920338</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. For the same reasons stated in that opinion, we declare that Clear\n\nChannel exercised its right of first refusal when it declined to renew the leases under\n\nthe terms offered by Potter to Clear Channel in the letter mailed on August 29,2005.\n\n      However, as to the issue ofattorney's fees, Potter's summary judgment sought\n\nrecovery ofhis attorney's fees and costs for both the declaratory judgment claim and\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fhis quantum meruit claim,13 and the evidence provided to the trial court did not\n\ndistinguish between fees related to each distinct claim.14 Potter may not recover\n\nattorney's fees and costs for the quantum meruit claim on which he did not prevail or\n\nrecover damages. See Green Int'l, Inc. v. Solis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2382247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2382247/green-intern-inc-v-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (Tex. 1997).\n\nAdditionally, any \"award [of] costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as\n\nare equitable and just\" in a declaratory judgment action is within the discretion ofthe\n\ntrial court. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 2008).\n\n      The trial court presumably did not award attorney's fees or costs to Potter\n\nbecause it denied his motion for summary judgment on his declaratory judgment\n\nclaim. Because we have reversed the trial court's denial of Potter's summary\n\n\n13\n      Potter's summary judgment motion specified that he was seeking attorney's\n      fees and costs \"pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 37.001 et. seq. and\n      [sic] Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 38.011, et. seq.\" The first reference is clearly\n      seeking recovery for attorney's fees related to his declaratory judgment action.\n      See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 2008) (permitting\n      trial court to award \"costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are\n      equitable and just\" in action for declaratory judgment). The second seems to\n      be an attempt to recover attorney's fees related to the quantum meruit claim.\n      See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001 (Vernon 2008) (permitting\n      recovery for attorney's fees and costs for variety of claims, including claims\n      as to rendered services, performed labor, furnished material, or oral or written\n      contract).\n14\n      See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299,313-14 (Tex. 2006)\n      (reaffirming rule that ifany attorney's fees relate solely to claim for which fees\n      are unrecoverable, claimant must segregate recoverable fees from\n      unrecoverable fees, and holding that remand required when fees not segregated\n      and at least some of attorney's fees are attributable only to claims for which\n      fees are not recoverable).\n\n                                          21\n\fjudgment, because we have declared in his favor the issues before the trial court for\n\ndeclaratory judgment,and because anyawardfor costsand reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney's fees \"as are equitable and just\" in a declaratory judgment action is\n\ndiscretionary, we conclude that cause should be remand to the trial court for it to\n\nconsider the issue of Potter's attorney's fees and costs on his declaratory judgment.\n\n      We sustain Potter's second issue.\n\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n\n      We reverse the trial court's judgment in part, affirm the judgment in part, and\n\nremand this cause with instructions. We reverse the judgment to the extent that it\n\nrendered summary judgment for Clear Channel and implicitly granted a declaratory\n\njudgment for Clear Channel. We affirm the judgment to the extent that it implicitly\n\nrendered a take-nothing judgment against Potter on his quantum meruit claim. We\n\nremand this cause to the trial court with instructionsto render a declaratoryjudgment\n\nin favor ofPotter consistent with this opinion and to consider Potter's request for the\n\naward of attorney's fees and costs under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nsection 37.009.
