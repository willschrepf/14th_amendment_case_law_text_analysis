C.R. at 8. On March 12, 2013,\n                       Appellee and Barbara McHale were appointed guardians\n\n1\n  Another sister, Barbara McHale, died during the course of this proceeding and a\nfourth sister, Betty Jane Grossman Bish, died several years before suit was filed and\nleft a son, Patrick Grossman, who is an heir under Edna Moon’s will.\n\n\n\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 1\n\f                         of the estate and person, respectively, of Edna Moon. On\n                         October 7, 2014, the trial court granted Appellee’s first\n                         motion for sanctions for discovery abuse – primarily for\n                         failing to identify bank account/real property information\n                         – awarding Appellee monetary sanctions of $15,000 plus\n                         an additional $3,000 in attorney’s fees (the “First Sanction\n                         Order”). C.R. at 544 and R.R. Vol. 8 at 54-55. The trial\n                         court also entered an Amended Docket Control Order\n                         setting out various pretrial deadline and setting the matter\n                         for jury trial on January 26, 2015.\n\n                         In compliance with the Amended Docket Control Order,\n                         on December 19, 2014 the Appellant filed her First\n                         Supplemental Answer and Counterclaim. C.R. at 558.\n                         Appellee sought additional discovery. The trial court was\n                         unable to hear the case on January 26, 2015 and it was\n                         reset for trial on March 9, 2015. C.R. at 846. The trial\n                         court set new deadlines for filing amended pleadings. Id.\n                         Appellant’s expert witness, Michael Turner, was deposed\n                         on January 13, 2015 and Appellant was deposed a second\n                         time on February 4, 2015. C.R. at 928 and 1067.\n\n                         On February 20, 2015, Appellee filed a second Motion for\n                         Sanctions based primarily on alleged inconsistencies in\n                         Appellant’s testimony and allegations Appellant was\n                         asserting “new” theories or claims. C.R. at 987. This\n                         motion for sanctions was ultimately heard by the trial court\n                         on March 2, 2015.\n\nTrial Court’s Disposition: On March 10, 2015 the trial court signed the Order\n                        Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions (the “Sanctions\n                        Order”) entering “death penalty” sanctions against\n                        Appellant including denying the Appellant the right to a\n                        jury trial on the damages issue. C.R. at 1621. The trial\n                        court made it clear the sanctions were entered as a result\n                        of false testimony and not based on Appellee’s allegations\n\n\n                             Appellant’s Brief – Page 2\n\f                      of Appellant asserting a new theory.

Beginning as early as March of 2000, Howard and Edna Moon gifted\n\nreal property to Appellant. By way of a gift deed dated March 3, 2000, Howard and\n\nEdna Moon deeded a lot in the Hunter’s Glen subdivision in Hays County to\n\nAppellant (the “Hunter’s Glen” property). C.R. at 1400. Similarly, by way of a Gift\n\nDeeds dated May 4, 2006, Howard and Edna Moon deeded a property on Ranch\n\nRoad 12 in Hays County to Appellant (the “RR 12” property) and property in\n\nGuadalupe County, Texas (the “Rest Haven” property or “Lake McQueeney”\n\nproperty). Id. at 1434 and 1439 and RR Vol. 15 at 805-12. The RR 12 and Rest\n\nHaven deeds are together referred to herein as the “Gift Deeds.”2 Edna Moon\n\nactively participated in the acquisition of Rest Haven property executing purchase\n\nrelated documents. Id. at 1409-32. Beginning no later than April 12 of 2000,\n\nHoward Moon, Edna Moon, and Appellant also entered into multi-party bank\n\naccounts with rights of survivorship and allocating ownership of the account in\n\nproportion to net contributions to the account. Id. at 1407; see also id. at 1406\n\n(similar account for Appellant and Edna Moon).\n\n\n\n\n2\n The “RR 12” property description is recorded in Vol. 2916, Page 759 of the Official\nPublic Records of Hays County, Texas and the “Rest Haven” property is described\nas Lot 140 and part of 139, Treasure Island Unit 1 in Guadalupe County, Texas.\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 5\n\f      2.     After Howard Moon died, Edna Moon revised her will leaving her\n\nestate to her then living daughters (Appellant, Appellee, and Barbara McHale) and\n\nto the son of her deceased daughter, Patrick Grossman, and acknowledging the debt\n\nowed to her by Appellee. C.R. at 1444 (dated February 27, 2007). Appellant\n\ncontinued to assisted her mother in the acquisition and disposition of other real\n\nproperty interests and which have been described in this litigation as the “La Playa”\n\nproperty and the “Park Place” property. Id. at 1460 and 1475.\n\n      3.     By September 2008, the Appellee (and Barbara McHale) were making\n\ncomplaints about the alleged misuse of Edna Moon’s estate to Mr. H.C. Kyle who\n\nwas the attorney for Howard and Edna Moon. Id. at 1467. A complaint was made\n\nto Adult Protective Services in the summer of 2009. APS investigated and spoke to,\n\namong others, Edna Moon, Mr. Kyle, and Edna Moon’s caregivers and ruled out\n\nclaims of exploitation of Edna Moon by Appellant as “invalid.” Id. at 1488 and R.R.\n\nVol. 15 at 128. Edna Moon then revised her will which included admonishments\n\nagainst similar complaints against Appellant by Appellee and Barbara McHale. C.R.\n\nat 1501 (will dated August 12, 2009). Appellee was notified of the change in the\n\nwill and the reasons for it by Mr. Kyle. Id. at 1514. Appellee responded to Mr. Kyle\n\nin August 2009 again complaining of Appellant. Id. at 1516.\n\n      4.     Upon Edna Moon’s return from an extended stay out of state, in\n\nOctober of 2011 Appellee and Barbara McHale took Edna Moon to another attorney\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 6\n\fto “discuss taking over our mother’s financial affairs” and had Edna Moon change\n\nher will and execute a statutory durable power of attorney naming Appellee as the\n\nagent. RR Vol. 15 at 18 and 22. The Appellee then filed this suit in February 2012\n\nalleging assorted causes of action based on alleged misuse of Edna Moon’s funds by\n\nAppellant. In March of 2012, Appellee and Barbara McHale and Edna Moon opened\n\na multi-party account with rights of survivorship and with ownership in proportion\n\nto net contributions similar to the accounts Edna Moon (and Howard Moon) opened\n\nwith Appellant. C.R. at 1521.\n\n        5.   During the proceeding, the Appellee complained that Appellant would\n\nnot provide appropriate information and documents. C.R. at 306, 987. Ultimately,\n\nthe trial court agreed and entered the Sanctions Order striking all of Appellant’s\n\nclaims and defenses and prohibiting a jury trial. Id. at 1621 [Appendix 1]. The trial\n\ncourt then held a bench trial solely on the issue of damages without allowing\n\nAppellant to assert any defenses. The trial court then entered the Final Judgment.\n\nId. at 1640 [Appendix 2]. The trial court also entered its findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law in support of the Sanctions Order and the Final Judgment. Id. at\n\n1678.\n\n                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n        6.   The Appellant appeals the Sanctions Order [C.R. at 1621 and\n\nAppendix 1] and Final Judgment [C.R. at 1640 and Appendix 2] arising out of the\n\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 7\n\fSanctions Order. The Appellant appeals the Sanctions Order as “unjust” because\n\nthe Sanctions Order imposed death penalty sanctions against Appellant when there\n\nwas no direct relationship between the alleged offensive conduct by the Appellant\n\nand the ultimate scope of the Sanctions Order. The Appellant also appeals the\n\nSanctions Order because the scope of the Sanctions Order was excessive and\n\nviolated Appellant’s constitutional rights in striking all of Appellant’s claims and\n\ndefenses. Further, Rules 13 and 215 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and\n\nChapter 10 of the Civil Practice & Remedies Code do not expand the analysis of\n\nwhether the Sanctions Order is “just.”\n\n      7_.    If this Court upholds the Sanctions Order, the Appellant also appeals\n\nthe Final Judgment it is based on the overly broad Sanctions Order and because it\n\nimproperly purports to award the Appellee a double or even triple recovery in\n\nviolation of the one satisfaction rule. There was no allocation requested or made by\n\nthe trial court among multiple causes of action asserted by Appellee and the award\n\nof Appellee’s actual/economic damages. However, with respect to some properties\n\nat issue, the Final Judgment awarded Appellee not only the value of the property,\n\nbut also the property itself and, in one case the additional remedy of a constructive\n\ntrust against Appellant’s homestead for more than $300,000, resulting in a double or\n\neven triple recovery by Appellee. Further, the damages calculations used for the\n\nconstructive trust in the Final Judgment also improperly fail to acknowledge the rule\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 8\n\fwhereby the first funds taken from a co-mingled accounts are presumed to belong to\n\nthe person holding the trust funds.\n\n      8.     There is insufficient evidence to support setting aside the “Gift Deeds”\n\nfrom Howard and Edna Moon to Appellant, and by doing so, the Final Judgment\n\nimproperly clouds the title of third-parties who were not before the trial court. The\n\nFinal Judgment and damages awarded do not take into consideration the contractual\n\nagreement and specific allocation of ownership of funds in, at least some, of the joint\n\naccounts at issue. The punitive damages award in the Final Judgment is also\n\nexcessive in light of the facts and the impact of the Sanctions Order.\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      9.     A trial court’s ruling on a motion for sanctions is reviewed under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. See e.g., American Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones, 192\n\nS.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex. 2006). The trial court entered findings of fact in support of\n\nthe Sanctions Order and Final Judgment. C.R. at 1678. However, in reviewing\n\nsanctions orders, the appellate courts are not bound by a trial court's findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law and must independently review the entire record to determine\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion. Id. This Court should review the\n\nappealed portions of the trial court’s judgment under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\nThe findings of fact by the trial court should be reviewed on a factual sufficiency\n\nbasis – is there sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding.\n\n\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 9\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n      10.    Appellant, Susan England (Lee) requests that the Court reverse, reform\n\nand/or render the trial court’s Sanction Order and Final Judgment based on the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                            THE SANCTIONS ORDER\n\n      11.    On March 10, 2015 the trial court entered the Order Granting Plaintiff’s\n\nMotion for Sanctions (the “Sanctions Order”). C.R. at 1621 [Appendix 1]. The\n\nSanctions Order was entered pursuant to Rules 13 and 215 Tex. R. Civ. P., Chapter\n\n10 of the Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code, and the Court’s inherent power to sanction.\n\nId. The Court made findings in connection with the Sanctions Order and entered\n\n“death penalty” type sanctions including, striking Appellant’s pleadings, granting a\n\ndefault judgment on issues of liability to Appellee and on all claims and defenses –\n\nwith all facts determined in favor of Appellee, and denying Appellant’s right to a\n\njury trial. Id. at 1628 [Appendix 1, page 8].\n\n      12.    While the imposition of sanctions is left to the sound discretion of the\n\ntrial court, any sanctions imposed must be \"just.” TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp.\n\nv., Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 917 (Tex. 1991). There are two general standards for\n\nmeasuring whether the sanction is “just” -- there must be a direct relationship\n\nbetween the offensive conduct and the sanction imposed and the sanction must not\n\nbe excessive. Am. Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones, 192 S.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex. 2006).\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 10\n\fThe imposition of very severe sanctions, like the “death penalty” sanctions entered\n\nin this case, is limited, not only by these two overriding standards, but by\n\nconstitutional due process. Id. In this case, the trial court erred in entering the death\n\npenalty sanctions against Appellant because: a) there was no direct relationship\n\nbetween the offensive conduct alleged and the scope of the Sanctions Order, b) the\n\nscope of the Sanctions Order was excessive, and c) the scope of the Sanctions Order\n\nimproperly invaded Appellant’s constitutional rights.\n\nA.    The Trial Court Erred in Entering Death Penalty Sanctions Against\n      Appellant Because There is Not a Direct Relationship Between the\n      Offensive Conduct and the Sanction Imposed.\n\n      13.    In order to meet her burden of proof in justifying the death penalty\n\nsanctions in this case, the Appellee must show that the conduct of the Appellant is\n\ndirectly related to the scope of the sanction imposed. In this case, the Appellee\n\ncomplains primarily of the Appellant’s failure to provide financial information and\n\nher alleged changes in testimony/position. However, the Appellee did not offer any\n\nevidence, and there was no finding by the Court, that anything the Appellant did\n\neffectively prevented the Appellee’s from preparing for trial. On the contrary, the\n\nAppellant, through her expert witness, accountant Mike Turner, accounted for all\n\nexpenditures of Edna Moon’s money from 2007 forward until Appellee took over\n\nEdna Moon’s estate. Mr. Turner testified at the sanctions hearing:\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 11\n\fQ. (BY MR. JUNKIN) Mr. Turner, were you hired as an\nexpert witness in this case?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Approximately when?\nA. January or February of 2014.\nQ. And did you prepare an initial report in this case on\nor about September the 11th of 2014?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And is your report primarily responsive to the report\nprepared by expert witnesses for the Plaintiff?\nA. Yes, that part was primarily responsive.\nQ. And that report, as you understand it, was provided\nto opposing counsel?\nA. I believe so by Mr. Morris and Mr. Wise.\nQ. And did you prepare a supplemental report on or about\nDecember 26th of 2014?\nA. Yes, I did.\nQ. What was the purpose of that supplemental report?\nA. It was to go into more depth about the actual use of\nthe funds. Not just the transfer of the funds but the use.\nQ. Was that supplemental report a change of your\noriginal opinion?\nA. No, it was just expounding on the information that\nhad not been provided.\n...\nQ. (BY MR. JUNKIN) Did your supplemental report\nbasically expand on your original report?\nA. To be as clear as possible, the original report was\nnot comprehensive from Sol Schwartz, so I took and corrected\nand, in fact, added amounts to their report that had been\ntransferred to Mrs. Moon and then continued forward with the\nuse and the proceeds of those funds, which I guess could --\ncould technically be considered supplementing where it went to\na conclusion.\nQ. Were you able, in connection with the supplemental\nreport, to be able to account for the estate of Edna Moon from\nback as far as 2007?\nA. Yes. I was able to track all of the money that had\ncome out of the joint account and -- or joint accounts and\n\n                Appellant’s Brief – Page 12\n\f             where they went into the four categories that I created for\n             the use of funds and then to ultimately where they were spent.\n             Q. Are you aware of the implication that that report had\n             been prepared and was ready as of the date the case was\n             mediated?\n             A. Yes, I was.\n             Q. Are you aware of and participated some in that\n             mediation; is that correct?\n             A. Yes, I was there.\n             Q. And is it true that the report was prepared in\n             advance of the mediation?\n             A. No, not at all. I had to work eight-and-a-half hours\n             Christmas Eve, which was the 24th; I worked about nine hours\n             on Christmas Day; and then another seven hours to finally\n             finish it on Friday.\n             Q. And subsequent to the preparation of that\n             supplemental report were you deposed?\n             A. Yes.\n             Q. And are you aware of any limitations on opposing\n             counsels' ability to ask you questions?\n             A. I don't think there was any limitation, no.\n             Q. And did you explain to them the nature and purpose of\n             that supplemental report during that deposition?\n             A. Yes, I did.\n\nRR, Vol. 12, Page 35, line 8 trough Page 36, Line 6; Page 37, Line 11 through Page\n\n38, Line 23. Mr. Turner further testified:\n\n             Q. And I think you may have testified to this at the\n             hearing last week, but have you been able to account for --\n             going back as far as 2007, have you been able to account for\n             all of Edna Moon's financial assets as a result of a careful\n             review of the documentation?\n             A. Yes. I've been able to ascertain the dollar amounts,\n             yes.\n\n\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 13\n\fRR Vol. 14, Page 123, lines 10 – 16.3 In other words, it was Appellant’s expert, Mr.\n\nTurner, who accounted for all of Edna Moon’s estate from approximately 2007\n\nforward and expanded on the scope of the estate described by Appellee’s expert\n\nwitness (Sol Schwartz). There was no evidence presented that any record or records\n\nthat might identify the scope of Mrs. Moon’s estate was/were not provided.\n\n      14.   The significance of this is that Appellee never argued or suggested that\n\nshe was not able to properly prepare for trial when all of Edna Moon’s estate had\n\nbeen accounted for as early as September, 2014.4 There was also no evidence of\n\nadditional information on the scope of Edna Moon’s estate that Appellee could\n\nproduce. As the Texas Supreme Court found:\n\n      We do not doubt that a failure to produce documents can prejudice a party's\n      efforts to assert or defend a claim. But here, there has simply been no showing\n      that the Garcias are unable to prepare for trial without the additional crash-\n      test reports they seek. Furthermore, the record fails to demonstrate Chrysler's\n      ability to produce the missing crash-test reports. There is no evidence in the\n      record that the missing tests exist or are within Chrysler's possession, custody,\n\n\n3\n  See also, R.R. Vol. 15 at 847, 850 -- Defendant’s Exhibit 2 where Mr. Turner\noutlined the corrections/changes from his September 11, 2014 report. The trial court\ndid not exclude this report and relied upon it in determining Appellee’s damages.\nSee generally, Norfolk Southern Railway Co. v. Bailey, 92 S.W.3d 577, 581 (Tex.\nApp.—Austin 2002, no pet.) (“In some instances, the change in an expert’s opinion\ndoes not require supplementation. For example, an expert may refine calculations\nor perfect a report up until the time of trial. An expert also may change an opinion\nwithout supplementation if the opinion is an ‘expansion of an already disclosed\nsubject.’”) (citations omitted).\n4\n Mr. Turner’s initial report was provided to Appellee’s counsel on September 12,\n2014 in a supplemental response to request for disclosure. C.R. at 576, 579.\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 14\n\f      or control, either actual or constructive. A party cannot be penalized for\n      failure to produce documents under such circumstances.\n\nChrysler Corp. v. Blackmon, 841 S.W.2d 844, 849-50 (Tex. 1992) (“there was no\n\ndirect relationship between the offensive conduct and the sanction imposed, as the\n\nplaintiffs did not show that they were unable to prepare for trial without the test\n\nreports, and the record did not demonstrate Chrysler's ability to produce the test\n\nreports”). There was no showing that all of the available records showing the\n\nexpenditures from the accounts at issue were not provided and no argument that the\n\nAppellee could not properly prepare for trial with the information that had been\n\npresented.\n\n      15.    Further, to the extent that the testimony of Appellee was inconsistent or\n\neven evasive with respect to the use of the funds in the accounts by Appellant vis a\n\nvis Appellee, the Sanctions Order, in striking all of Appellant’s defenses, removed\n\ndefenses/claims (limitations, contractual, parol evidence, etc.) that were not\n\ncontingent on or did not factually depend on disputes as to the use of the funds. As\n\ndiscussed in more detail in, for example, paragraphs 17-21, 36 and 37 below, the\n\nscope of the Sanction Order was so broad in striking all of Appellant’s\n\ndefenses/claims that there was not a direct relationship between the offensive\n\nconduct alleged and the defenses/claims impacted by the Sanctions Order.\n\n\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 15\n\fB.    The Trial Court Erred in Entering Death Penalty Sanctions Against\n      Appellant Because the Sanction Order was an Excessive Penalty.\n\n      16.    “Death penalty sanctions should not be used to deny a trial on the merits\n\nunless the court finds that the sanctioned party's conduct \"justifies a presumption\n\nthat its claims or defenses lack merit\" and that \"it would be unjust to permit the party\n\nto present the substance of that position [which is the subject of the withheld\n\ndiscovery] before the court.\" Chrysler Corp. v. Blackmon, 841 S.W.2d 844, 850\n\n(Tex. 1992). The trial court found that Appellant was not truthful and changed her\n\ntestimony through the course of the proceeding. Rather than exclude Appellant’s\n\ntestimony or allow Appellant’s “changes” in testimony to be used for impeachment\n\nor even strike those defenses directly correlated with the changes in testimony, the\n\ntrial court entered death penalty sanctions striking all of Appellant’s claims and\n\ndefenses.\n\n      17.    For example, Appellant has a statute of limitations defense. Many of\n\nthe allegedly wrongful transactions on which Appellee’s damages were based took\n\nplace well over four (4) years before suit was filed in February 23, 2012. C.R. at 8.5\n\n5\n For example, the Hunter’s Glen property was gifted to Appellant in March of 2000,\n(C.R. at 1400), the Rest Haven property was purchased in April, 2005 (C.R. at 1427),\nthe RR 12 property was gifted to Appellant in May 2006 (R.R. Vol. 15 at 805), the\nRest Haven Property was gifted to Appellant in May 2006 (R.R. Vol. 15 at 809), the\nLa Playa property was purchased in October 2007 (C.R. at 1457), and the Hilliard\nRoad property was purchased in November 2007 (C.R. at 1462). See also, R.R.\nVol. 15 at 862 (timeline in Mr. Turner’s report).\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 16\n\fThe accrual of Appellee’s causes of action is a question of law, to be determined by\n\nthe court and Appellant’s testimony does not turn the question of the accrual of any\n\nasserted claims for limitations purposes into a fact question. See Moreno v. Sterling\n\nDrug, Inc., 787 S.W.2d 348, 351 (Tex. 1990) (“[T]he question when a cause of\n\naction accrues is a judicial one . . . .”); Mid-South Telecommunications, Co. v. Best,\n\n184 S.W.3d 386, 390 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, no pet.) (“When a cause of action\n\naccrues is a question of law. A cause of action generally accrues at the time when\n\nfacts come into existence that authorize a claimant to seek a judicial remedy.”)\n\n(citations omitted). There was no evidence that any action or inaction by Appellant\n\njustifies a presumption that her limitations defenses lack merit. There was no\n\nevidence or insufficient evidence of a direct correlation between the conduct of\n\nAppellant resulting in the sanction prohibiting, for example, her limitations defense.6\n\n      18.    Similarly, there were original contractual agreements with respect to\n\nthe use of the “joint accounts.” See C.R. 1403 (deposition on written questions of\n\nRosemary Petry, Frost Bank representative).7 The Frost Bank accounts ending in\n\n\n\n6\n The parol evidence rule and statute of frauds would also tend to prohibit testimony\nthat contradicts evidence in the recorded gift deeds or the purpose for them. Both\nthe Gift Deeds to Appellant provide for the consideration for those deeds and\ndescribe the nature of those conveyances.\n7\n See RR, Vol 14 at 47, Line 17 through page 50, line 8 (admitting into evidence the\ndocuments attached to Appellant’s Summary Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for\nSanctions).\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 17\n\f8650 and 9898 were created as multi-party accounts with right of survivorship and\n\nprovided that:\n\n      The parties to the account own the account in proportion to the parties’ net\n      contributions to the account. The financial institution may pay any sum in the\n      account to a party at any time. On the death of a party, the party’s ownership\n      of the account passes to the surviving parties.\n\nId. at 1406 and 1407. This agreement was signed by Edna Moon and Appellant for\n\nthe account ending in 8650 and initialed by Edna Moon, Howard Moon, and\n\nAppellant with respect to the account ending in 9898. Id.8 The agreement governed\n\nthe use and ownership of the account and there is insufficient evidence to change\n\nthose terms. The Appellee made no specific claim that those agreements were\n\nfraudulently induced.\n\n      19.   There also was an Adult Protective Services investigation in July-\n\nAugust of 2009 that contains evidence rebutting any presumption that may have been\n\nraised by the conduct of Appellant. See C.R. 1485 and R.R. Vol. 15 at 125 (the\n\n“APS Report”). In the APS Report, it is alleged that Appellant was “misusing” Edna\n\nMoon’s funds. Id. at 1489. However, the APS investigator interviewed attorney\n\nH.C. Kyle in August 2009 and noted:\n\n      Mr. Kyle explained he has been Howard Moon (deceased) and Edna Moon’s\n      attorney for years. Mr. Kyle is familiar with Deed of Gift of Lake McQueeney\n\n8\n  It is interesting to note that the Frost Bank accounts ending in 8381 and 4607\nnaming Edna Moon and/or Appellee or Barbara McHale and Kolbe were created as\nthe same kind of account with rights of survivorship. C.R. at 1522.\n\n                             Appellant’s Brief – Page 18\n\f      property, Deed of Gift of Ranch Road 12 property, and Edna Moon’s Last\n      Will and Testament. Mr. Kyle reports that Barbara and Janice have\n      complained to him about Ms. England’s mis-management of the client’s\n      money. Mr. Kyle reports Ms. Moon has not complained about Susan\n      England’s management of her resources or reported financial abuse.\n\nId. at 1495. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that Edna Moon9 was not\n\naware of what she was doing with respect to signing deeds, prepared by her lawyer,\n\nand in gifting the RR 12 and Rest Haven properties to Appellant. C.R. 1434-42.\n\n      20.   Further, the investigator reported that: “Client [Edna Moon] states that\n\nCw should stop harassing Susan England. Client states Susan has always managed\n\nthe client’s financial affairs fairly and legally.” Id. at 1497. The allegation of\n\nexploitation of Mrs. Moon by Appellant was found to be “invalid.” Shortly,\n\nthereafter, Mrs. Moon amended her will, again naming Susan England as Executor,\n\nand adding a provision:\n\n      In the event my situation is ever again investigated by Texas Adult Protective\n      Services or similar governmental agency, or in the event charges are ever filed\n      against my daughter, SUSAN K. ENGLAND, in connection with her handling\n      of my affairs and which charges do not result in a conviction, or in the even a\n      civil suit is ever brought by either BARBARA JEANNE McHALE or\n      JANICE LYNN KOLBE against SUSAN KAY ENGLAND for any reason,\n      then the disposition and administration of my estate shall be as if BARBARA\n      JEANNE McHALE AND JANIS LYNN KOLBE had both predeceased me\n      without issue.”\n\n\n\n\n9\n Or, for that matter, that Mr. Moon did not intend to gift the RR 12 and Rest Haven\nproperty to Susan England.\n                             Appellant’s Brief – Page 19\n\fId. at 1502-03 (Last Will and Testament of Edna Brackett Moon dated Aug. 12,\n\n2009). At the request of Edna Moon, Mr. Kyle also notified Appellee of the change\n\nin the will. C.R. at 1514.\n\n      21.    There is additional evidence that Edna Moon was aware of what was\n\nhappening with respect to purchases of real property. For example, Mrs. Moon\n\nsigned closing documents for the purchase of the Rest Haven property. See e.g., CR\n\n1418, 1419, and 1421. Even Tom Huth testified that:\n\n             Q. When we took your deposition, you mentioned\n             that you thought that Susan was a nice person but that\n             she had done some things wrong, that she needed to\n             correct that. Could you elaborate on what you think it\n             is that she has done wrong.\n             A. I -- I feel that she's just taken advantage of\n             her mother and all her money on there. I think that she\n             just needs to, you know, fess up and say, \"Okay. Let's\n             settle this all out. Let's give all this money back.\n             It's all supposed to be split up four ways.\" And that\n             was Morn's -- and her dad's plan. And that's the way --\n             that's the way it should be.\n             And I think that she's used up a -- these\n             assets of her morn and her dad, and she used them for her\n             own personal use or for buying her houses and stuff, or\n             used them under the guise that Mom is really, you know,\n             the owner of these things. And without Mom's money or\n             -- and her dad's money, none of this would have -- could\n             have occurred. So -- and she needs to -- you know, I\n             said, \"Mom intended\" -- whenever Mom gave her any of\n             this money, she -- Mom -- in fact, Edna always had told\n             me this too, she said, \"All this money that's going into\n             all this stuff that I've invested in with Susan is\n             basically for the\" -- and it wasn't so much an\n             investment with -- with Susan, it was an investment for\n\n\n                             Appellant’s Brief – Page 20\n\f            Edna, and it was supposed to be split up four ways to\n            all the heirs after Mom's death, if she didn't spend it\n            first.\n\nCR 1542 at 1544-45.\n\n      22.   There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that conduct complained\n\nof by the Appellee justified a presumption that Appellant’s claims or defenses\n\nrelating to Mrs. Moon’s knowledge of the uses of funds in issue lack merit. At a\n\nminimum, if such a presumption could arise, there is ample evidence outside of\n\nAppellant’s testimony to rebut any such presumption.\n\n      23.   The Appellant acknowledges that the trial court was not required to\n\nactually impose lesser sanctions10 and that the Sanctions Order includes findings\n\nindicating that the trial court did consider lesser sanctions and imposed a lesser\n\nsanction in the First Sanction Order. However, there is no or insufficient evidence\n\nthat the sanction entered in the First Sanction Order was not effective. There was\n\nsufficient information from Appellant to allow for a full accounting of all of the\n\n\n10\n  As the Texas Supreme Court explained in GTE Communications Sys. Corp. v.\nTanner, 856 S.W.2d 725 (Tex. 1993):\n\n      We reaffirmed our TransAmerican holding in GTE, specifically noting that a\n      trial court was required to consider the availability of lesser sanctions before\n      imposing death penalty sanctions. Under this standard, the trial court need not\n      test the effectiveness of each available lesser sanction by actually imposing\n      the lesser sanction on the party before issuing the death penalty; rather, the\n      trial court must analyze the available sanctions and offer a reasoned\n      explanation as to the appropriateness of the sanction imposed.\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 21\n\faccounts in issue by Mr. Turner after the First Sanctions Order. While the Sanctions\n\nOrder does make specific findings/references to prior “admonitions” from the trial\n\ncourt to Appellant and attaches some significance to them in connection with\n\nattempts at lesser sanctions,11 admonitions are not sanctions. Williams v. Akzo\n\nChemicals, 999 S.W.2d 836, 843 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1999, no pet.) (“Although the\n\nCMO [case management order] included a warning that noncompliance would result\n\nin dismissal, neither a threat to sanction, without more, nor the intent to sanction, is\n\na sanction. . . . The CMO is not a sanction. It is an order and a threat.”). Any alleged\n\nfailure to comply with admonitions from the Court is no evidence or insufficient\n\nevidence of an unwillingness to comply with a sanctions order. There is no or\n\ninsufficient evidence that Appellant failed to comply with the First Sanction Order.\n\nC.    The Trial Court Erred in Entering Death Penalty Sanctions Against\n      Appellant Because the Scope of the Sanction Order Violated Appellant’s\n      Constitutional Due Process Rights.\n\n      24.    The entry of death penalty sanctions also implicates the sanctioned\n\nparty’s constitutional due process rights. As the Texas Supreme Court discussed in\n\nTransAmerican: “When a trial court strikes a party's pleadings and dismisses its\n\naction or renders a default judgment against it for abuse of the discovery process,\n\nthe court adjudicates the party's claims without regard to their merits but based\n\n\n11\n  See e.g., C.R. at 1621 (paragraph 2) and 1627 (paragraph 48); see also RR Vol.\n12, page 116, lines 21-23.\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 22\n\finstead upon the parties' conduct of discovery.” TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp.\n\nv. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 918 (Tex. 1991). Because of that, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt noted:\n\n      [T]here are constitutional limitations upon the power of courts, even in aid of\n      their own valid processes, to dismiss an action without affording a party the\n      opportunity for a hearing on the merits of his cause.\n\nId. (citations omitted). Because of the underlying due process issues, “[d]iscovery\n\nsanctions cannot be used to adjudicate the merits of a party's claims or defenses\n\nunless a party's hindrance of the discovery process justifies a presumption that its\n\nclaims or defenses lack merit.” Id. However, if a party refuses to produce material\n\nevidence, despite the imposition of lesser sanctions, the court may presume that an\n\nasserted claim or defense lacks merit and dispose of it. Id.\n\n      25.      As discussed above, Appellee did present evidence sufficient to allow\n\nfor an accounting of all the accounts in issue from 2007 until the Appellee took over\n\nEdna Moon’s accounts. While punishment and deterrence are legitimate purposes\n\nfor sanctions, they do not justify trial by sanctions. TransAmerican, 811 S.W.2d at\n\n918. Sanctions which are so severe as to preclude presentation of the merits of the\n\ncase should not be assessed absent a party's flagrant bad faith or counsel's callous\n\ndisregard for the responsibilities of discovery under the rules. Id. As further\n\ndiscussed above, there is ample evidence supporting claims and defenses of the\n\nAppellant and such claims are not meritless.\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 23\n\f         26.   The Appellee did not establish that any evidence with respect to the\n\naccounts was withheld by Appellant sufficient to justify a presumption that all of her\n\nclaims and defenses lacked merit. The Appellee did not produce any evidence of\n\ninformation about the accounts that was withheld after the trial court’s First\n\nSanctions Order. There is insufficient evidence that the alleged misconduct of the\n\nAppellant justifies a presumption that all of her claims and defenses are without\n\nmerit and death penalty sanctions should not have been used to deny the Appellant\n\na trial on the merits.\n\n         27.   There are references in the Sanctions Order to selling property and\n\nusing money to pay fees and for Appellant’s own purposes. See e.g., CR 1624 and\n\n1626, paragraphs 20, 21, 22, 23, and 36). There are also references to Appellant\n\nproviding false deposition testimony. Id. at 1623, paragraph 12. However, there is\n\nno legal basis – no order, statute, rule, etc. – to authorize the trial court’s imposition\n\nof sanctions for this conduct and it should not have been taken into consideration in\n\nconnection with entering the Sanctions Order.12 It was a violation of Appellant’s\n\ndue process rights for the trial court to have relied on this conduct as a basis for the\n\nSanctions Order.\n\n\n\n\n12\n     See e.g., paragraph 23 above.\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 24\n\f      28.    Accordingly, in striking all of the Appellant’s claims and defenses and\n\nprohibiting a jury trial, the scope of the Sanctions Order violates the Appellant’s due\n\nprocess right to presentation of the merits of her claims and defenses.\n\nD.    In Light of the Foregoing General Standards for Review of Death Penalty\n      Sanctions, Section 10.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n      Does Not Provide an Appropriate Basis for Death Penalty Sanctions\n      Against Appellant.\n\n      29.    Section 10.001 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code provides\n\nfor imposition of sanctions in connection with the signing of pleadings and motions.\n\nSection 10.001 provides:\n\n      The signing of a pleading or motion as required by the Texas Rules of Civil\n      Procedure constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's best\n      knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry:\n            (1) the pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper\n            purpose, including to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless\n            increase in the cost of litigation;\n            (2) each claim, defense, or other legal contention in the pleading or\n            motion is warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for\n            the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n            establishment of new law;\n            (3) each allegation or other factual contention in the pleading or motion\n            has evidentiary support or, for a specifically identified allegation or\n            factual contention, is likely to have evidentiary support after a\n            reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and\n            (4) each denial in the pleading or motion of a factual contention is\n            warranted on the evidence or, for a specifically identified denial, is\n            reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §10.001.\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 25\n\f      30.    In connection with the imposition of sanctions under Chapter 10, the\n\nparty moving for sanctions must prove the pleading party's subjective state of mind.\n\nBrozynski v. Kerney, (Tex. App.--Waco Aug. 2, 2006, pet. denied), citing, Mattly v.\n\nSpiegel, Inc., 19 S.W.3d 890, 896 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.).\n\nThe movant must show, and the court must describe and explain, that the pleading\n\nwas filed for the improper purpose of harassment. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 10.001(1); § 10.005 (\"A court shall describe in an order imposing a\n\nsanction under this chapter the conduct the court has determined violated Section\n\n10.001 and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.\"). The Appellee, as the\n\nmovant for sanctions, had the burden of proving violations of sections 10.001(1) and\n\n10.001(3). R.M. Dudley Constr. Co., Inc. v. Dawson, 258 S.W.3d 694, 709 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Waco 2008, pet. denied).\n\n      31.    Under § 10.001(3), the applicable standard is whether, to the signatory's\n\nbest knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, each\n\nallegation or other factual contention in a pleading has evidentiary support or, for a\n\nspecifically identified allegation or factual contention, is likely to have evidentiary\n\nsupport after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 10.001(3).\n\n      32.    The Sanctions Order in this case does not identify with particularity the\n\nspecific motion or pleading the trial court found violated §10.001 or the Appellant’s\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 26\n\frole in the filing of such pleading or motion. There is insufficient evidence that\n\nAppellant caused any pleading or motion to be filed for the purpose of harassment.13\n\nAs discussed in detail infra, there is evidence of factual support for Appellant’s\n\nclaims and defenses.\n\nE.    In Light of the Foregoing General Standards for Review of Death Penalty\n      Sanctions, Rule 13 TRCP Does Not Provide an Appropriate Basis for\n      Death Penalty Sanctions Against Appellant.\n\n      33.    Rule 13 directs a trial court to presume that a pleading was filed in good\n\nfaith. TEX. R. CIV. P. 13; GTE Communications Systems Corp. v. Tanner, 856\n\nS.W.2d 725, 731 (Tex. 1993). “Thus, the burden is on the party moving for sanctions\n\nto overcome this presumption.\" Id. Rule 13 provides:\n\n      The signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them that they\n      have read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their\n      knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the\n      instrument is not groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and\n      brought for the purpose of harassment. Attorneys or parties who shall bring a\n      fictitious suit as an experiment to get an opinion of the court, or who shall file\n      any fictitious pleading in a cause for such a purpose, or shall make statements\n      in pleading which they know to be groundless and false, for the purpose of\n      securing a delay of the trial of the cause, shall be held guilty of a contempt. If\n      a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court,\n      upon motion or upon its own initiative, after notice and hearing, shall impose\n\n13\n   A trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing to make the necessary factual\ndeterminations about the party's or attorney's motives and credibility. Alejandro v.\nRobstown ISD, 131 S.W.3d 663, 670 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2004, no pet.). The\npleading alone cannot establish that the represented party or its attorney brought their\ncase in bad faith or to harass.\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 27\n\f      an appropriate sanction available under Rule 215-2b, upon the person who\n      signed it, a represented party, or both.\n\n      Courts shall presume that pleadings, motions, and other papers are filed in\n      good faith. No sanctions under this rule may be imposed except for good\n      cause, the particulars of which must be stated in the sanction order.\n      \"Groundless\" for purposes of this rule means no basis in law or fact and not\n      warranted by good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal\n      of existing law. A general denial does not constitute a violation of this rule.\n      The amount requested for damages does not constitute a violation of this rule.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 13.\n\n      34.    In determining whether a party conducted a reasonable inquiry, the\n\nfacts and evidence available to the party and the circumstances existing when the\n\nparty filed the pleading must be examined. See Karagounis v. Property Co. of Am.,\n\n970 S.W.2d 761, 764 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1998, pet. denied) (\"the circumstances\n\npivotal to the determination of whether sanctions should issue are those in existence\n\nat the time the pleading in question was signed and filed. Sanctions for frivolous or\n\ngroundless pleadings do not apply to the pursuit of an action later determined to be\n\ngroundless after pleadings were filed. Overman v. Baker, 26 S.W.3d 506, 509 (Tex.\n\nApp.--Tyler 2000, no pet.); Karagounis, 970 S.W.2d at 764 (Rule 13 \"says nothing\n\nabout levying sanctions if one pursues an action or pleading thought legitimate when\n\nfiled but subsequently found baseless.\").\n\n      35.    The Sanctions Order in this case does not specifically identify the\n\nmotion or pleading the trial court found violated Rule 13 or the Appellant’s role in\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 28\n\fthe filing of such an improper motion or pleading. As discussed herein, there are\n\nsufficient facts to support Appellant’s claims/defenses. However, the Sanctions\n\nOrder refers to discovery responses and an affidavit filed in support of removing a\n\nlis pendens claim as documents signed by Appellant and forming part of the basis of\n\nthe Sanctions Order.\n\n      36.    As to the discovery responses, the trial court found the responses were\n\nunreasonably frivolous, made for the purpose of delay, groundless, brought in bad\n\nfaith, and evasive. However, those findings alone are not necessarily sufficient to\n\nsupport a finding that Appellant’s claims and defenses lacked merit or to justify entry\n\nof death penalty sanctions. See Lanfear v. Blackmon, 827 S.W.2d 87, 90-91 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.--Corpus Christi 1992, orig. proceeding) (“That the answers were\n\nincomplete or intentionally evasive is not such an obstruction of discovery to justify\n\nthe conclusion that the claim or defense lacked merit without more. The ‘crime’ did\n\nnot justify the punishment. The trial court abused its discretion by striking Lanfear's\n\npleadings in its first sanction order.”); see also Williams v. Akzo Chemicals, 999\n\nS.W.2d 836, 843 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1999, no pet.) (“That their original answers\n\nwere incomplete or even intentionally evasive is not such an obstruction of discovery\n\nto justify the conclusion that their claims lacked merit without more.”). No specific\n\ndiscovery responses were identified in the Sanctions Order as lacking merit.\n\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 29\n\f      37.    As to the affidavit made in connection with lifting the Lis Pendens,\n\nAppellant testified that Edna Moon “has never had any ownership interest” in the La\n\nPlaya property or the Hilliard Road property. CR at 58. The Sanctions Order makes\n\na finding that Appellant lied in making that statement. CR at 1623 (paragraph 11).\n\nBoth of these properties were, at one time, held in the name of Appellant. See CR\n\n1457 and 1462. There is no evidence that either of these properties was ever deeded\n\nto, or otherwise titled in the name of, Edna Moon. Additionally, part of Appellee’s\n\nargument for sanctions was that Appellant “changed” her story to allege a “silent\n\npartnership.” While Appellant denies there was a partnership relating to these two\n\n(2) properties, if there was, Appellant would be correct that Appellee (and Appellant)\n\nhad no ownership interest in these properties. See TEX. BUS. ORG. CODE §152.101\n\n(“Partnership property is not the property of the partners.”). While Appellant’s\n\nintent behind the statement may differ from its technical legal veracity, it is clear\n\nthat the trial court did not rely on that statement in expunging the Lis Pendens. See\n\nCR at 67 (the court struck out two findings relating to Appellee’s claim to the real\n\nproperty but went ahead and expunged the lis pendens because Appellee did not\n\nprovide proper service of the required notice). The intent behind Rule 13 does not\n\njustify the imposition of death penalty sanctions for the statement in the affidavit,\n\nparticularly when it was disregarded by the trial court in expunging the lis pendens.\n\n\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 30\n\fF.    In Light of the Foregoing General Standards for Review of Death Penalty\n      Sanctions, Rule 215.5 Does Not Provide an Appropriate Basis for Death\n      Penalty Sanctions Against Appellant.\n\n      38.    Before a court may deprive a party of its right to present the merits of\n\nits case because of discovery abuse, it must determine that a party's hindrance of the\n\ndiscovery process justifies a presumption that the party’s claims lack merit.\n\nTransAmerican, 811 S.W.2d at 918. As discussed above, there was no direct\n\ncorrelation made between any conduct by Appellant in connection with responding\n\nto discovery that would lead to a presumption that all of Appellant’s claims and\n\ndefenses lacked merit.\n\n      39.    For all the reasons set out hereinabove, the trial court erred in striking\n\nall of Appellant’s claims and defenses because: a) there was no direct relationship\n\nbetween the allegedly offensive conduct by Appellant and the scope of the Sanctions\n\nOrder, b) the scope of the Sanctions Order was excessive, and c) the scope of the\n\nSanctions Order improperly invaded Appellant’s constitutional rights. See State v.\n\nTarget Corp., 194 S.W.3d 46, 52 n.6 (Tex. App.—Waco 2006, no pet.) (“We do\n\nnote, however, that authority supports the State's position that a due process analysis\n\nunder TransAmerican Nat. Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913 (Tex. 1991), is\n\nappropriate when application of the discovery rules results in merits-preclusive or\n\ndeath-penalty sanctions”).\n\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 31\n\f                             THE FINAL JUDGMENT14\n\nG.    The Final Judgment Violated the “One-Satisfaction” Rule by Granting\n      Appellee a “Double Recovery” for Actual Damages and the Property\n      Itself.\n\n      40.    It is well-established law that a plaintiff may not recover the same\n\nactual damages twice under alternative causes of action or remedies. See e.g.,\n\nSouthern County Mut. Ins. Co. v. First Bank & Trust of Groves, 750 S.W.2d 170,\n\n173-74 (Tex. 1988); Birchfield v. Texarkana Memorial Hosp., 747 S.W.2d 361, 367\n\n(Tex. 1987); Stevenson v. Koutzarov, 795 S.W.2d 313, 322 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1990, writ denied). The plaintiff is required to segregate or allocate economic\n\ndamages among any of the different causes of action asserted to avoid violation of\n\nthe one satisfaction rule. See e.g., Saden v. Smith, 415 S.W.3d 450, 469 (Tex. App.-\n\n-Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, pet. denied) (“In sum, Smith demonstrated his entitlement\n\nto a unified recovery for one broadly described injury with one damages model\n\nsponsored by accountant Shields. Accordingly, Smith failed to justify separate\n\nawards for alternate theories of liability, as the theories as presented at trial did not\n\ndepend on separate and distinct injuries resulting in separate and distinct damages.\n\n\n\n14\n  For the reasons set out above, the Appellant also appeals the entry of the Final\nJudgment based on the striking of Appellant’s pleadings, claims, and defenses in\nthe Sanctions Order. However, if this Court finds the Sanctions Order is proper,\nthe Appellant appeals the Final Judgment for the reasons set out below.\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 32\n\fUnder such circumstances, allowing the recovery of actual damages for both breach\n\nof contract and breach of fiduciary duty violates the one-satisfaction rule, and is\n\ntherefore error.”) (citations omitted).\n\n      41.    The trial court entered judgment based on calculations and accounting\n\ninformation primarily presented by Appellant’s expert witness, Michael Turner,\n\nCPA. See C.R. 1699 (the trial court’s actual damages calculations) and R.R., Vol.\n\n15 at 312-17 (portions of Mr. Turner’s revised supplemental report [2/5/15]). Those\n\nactual economic damage calculations do not segregate or allocate economic damages\n\namong any of the different causes of action asserted by Appellee and preclude\n\nAppellee from now allocating damages among her causes of action. Because of that,\n\nthose damages calculations also reflect violations of the one satisfaction rule and an\n\nimproper double/triple recovery for Appellee.\n\n                         La Playa and Park Place Properties\n\n      42.    The first entry on the trial court’s damages calculations (C.R. at 1699)\n\nreflects an amount of $683,394 (less $5,410) as “Funds from Edna spent by\n\nEngland.” C.R. at 1699. That amount includes the funds for the purchase of the “La\n\nPlaya” (“LP”) and “Park Place” (“PP”) properties. See R.R., Vol. 15 at 313 and 315.\n\nHowever, the next entry on the judgment calculation sheet includes additional actual\n\ndamages of sale proceeds from the sale of those two properties – described as the\n\n“Cash Out at Sale” on Mr. Tuner’s report. Id. at 315. Both of these properties sold\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 33\n\fat a net loss. So, the Final Judgment awarded the Appellee not only the money used\n\nto purchase the properties, but also the proceeds from the sale of the properties which\n\nnecessarily would have included the funds to purchase the properties – especially\n\nwhen the properties sold at a loss. There was no evidence or insufficient evidence\n\nof the market value of the properties at the time they were sold and no evidence that\n\nmore than market value was paid at the time of the purchase of those properties.\n\nAwarding the Appellee all of the fund used to purchase the property and the sale\n\nproceeds, when the properties sold at a loss, is not a proper measure of damages and\n\namounts to an improper double recovery.\n\n               RR 12 and Rest Haven (Lake McQueeney) Properties\n\n      43.    The Final Judgment also includes an award of actual damages of\n\n$338,631 for the sale proceeds from the RR 12 property and $96,524 for the sale\n\nproceed from the Rest Haven property. C.R. 1699. However, the Final Judgement\n\nwent on to award Appellee the properties themselves by declaring the Gift Deeds\n\n“set aside . . . void and without effect.” C.R. 1641. There was no showing by the\n\nAppellee that the sales price for the properties was under or less than market value.\n\nThe Final Judgment awards the Appellee not only the market value of the properties,\n\nbut also the properties themselves. Accordingly, in awarding both the sales price\n\nand voiding the Gift Deeds, the Final Judgment improperly grants the Plaintiff a\n\ndouble recovery and violates the one satisfaction rule.\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 34\n\f         44.   Despite the plain language of the Gift Deeds and the statute of frauds\n\nand parol evidence rule that would tend to prohibit testimony that the deeds of these\n\nproperties were not “gifts” to Appellant, the Appellee pled that Appellant\n\nrepresented that she would “hold title in a nominee/agency capacity for the benefit\n\nof . . . [Edna Moon’s] other daughters and grandson Patrick.” C.R. 1588 (page 8 of\n\nPlaintiff’s Fifth Amended Original Petition). However, to the extent that the\n\nAppellant was holding these assets in trust for beneficiaries (including herself) there\n\nwas no evidence of any limits placed on Appellant’s management of such trust assets\n\nor that she not would have all rights and powers granted to a trustee under the Texas\n\nProperty Code (Texas Trust Code).15 If there was no trust relationship created, but\n\nthe transfer was not intended as a gift, the Appellee, in her representative capacity,\n\nlacks standing to bring an action for recovery of property held for the purported\n\nbenefit of other persons.\n\nH.       The Trial Court Erred in Imposing a “Constructive Trust Lien” Against\n         Appellant’s Homestead and Vehicle Because it is Not the Proper Remedy\n         and There is No Evidence or Insufficient Evidence to Support the\n         Amount of the Constructive Trusts Set Out in the Final Judgment.\n\n         45.   “Imposition of a constructive trust is not a cause of action, but rather an\n\nequitable remedy.” LTTS Charter School, Inc. v. Palasota, 362 S.W.3d 202, 209\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.). Effectively, the Final Judgment awards the\n\n\n15\n     See Chapters 112, 113, 114, and 115 of the Texas Property Code.\n\n                                 Appellant’s Brief – Page 35\n\fAppellee a double recovery for the La Playa property and triple recovery for the RR\n\n12 property – the sales proceeds from the sale of the RR 12 and La Playa properties,\n\nthe RR 12 property itself, and a constructive trust for the RR 12 sale proceeds. The\n\nFinal Judgment does not allocate actual damages for any particular cause of action\n\nand there was no election of remedies. Appellee is not entitled to a combined\n\nrecovery of actual economic damages under each of her alleged claims\n\n      46.   For example, in Willis v. Donnelly, the 14th Court of Appeals was faced\n\nwith the impact of a constructive trust remedy when actual damages were awarded.\n\nThe Willis court found:\n\n             Lastly, appellants argue that the constructive trust triples Donnelly's\n      recovery. Donnelly concedes that the constructive trust duplicates the money\n      judgment and seeks remand for an election of remedies. \"A party who seeks\n      redress under two or more theories of recovery for a single wrong must elect,\n      before the judgment is rendered, under which remedy he wishes the court to\n      enter judgment.\" If the prevailing party fails to elect a remedy, the trial court\n      should render a judgment affording the greater recovery. If the trial court fails\n      to do so, generally, we will reform the judgment to effect such an election.\n      See id.\n\n            However, appellate courts sometimes remand a case for an election of\n      remedies. We remand the constructive trust in this case for two reasons. First,\n      the portion of the constructive trust imposed upon 50% of URB stock and 10%\n      of WHE stock duplicates recovery for breach of contract, which we have\n      reversed and remanded. Thus, the constructive trust on the URB and WHE\n      stock is also reversed and remanded. Second, we are unable to determine\n      which remedy for breach of fiduciary duty (the money damages or the\n      constructive trust on the realty) provides a greater recovery. Accordingly, we\n      remand for an election of remedies for breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 36\n\fWillis v. Donnelly, 118 S.W.3d 10, 43-44 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003),\n\naff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, 199 S.W.3d 262 (Tex. 2006)\n\n(citations omitted). In this case the Final Judgment does not reflect an election of\n\nremedies by the Appellee and improperly purports to allow for the recovery of actual\n\ndamages in addition to a constructive trust.16\n\n     The Constructive Trust on Appellant’s Homestead for $306,000 is Improper\n\n       47.   If this Court finds a constructive trust is the proper remedy, the Final\n\nJudgement purports to impose a constructive trust in the specific amount of $306,000\n\non Appellant’s homestead at 4919 West Frances Place in Austin. C.R. 1641 (page\n\n2 of Final Judgment) and C.R. 1685 (findings of fact, paragraph 53). Based on the\n\nevidence before the court, the amount of the constructive trust is incorrect and\n\ntherefore there is insufficient evidence to support it.\n\n       48.   When “trust” funds are commingled with personal funds and funds are\n\ndrawn out, it is presumed that the first funds drawn out were personal funds. See\n\ne.g., Moody v. Pitts, 708 S.W.2d 930, 937 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1986,\n\n\n\n16\n  See generally W. Miller, NON-MONETARY RELIEF, EQUITABLE RELIEF, Article for\nState Bar of Texas 7th Annual Damages in Civil Litigation, page 2 (February 26-27,\n2015) (“Where multiple causes of action are asserted at trial, if the verdict is returned\nfavorably to the plaintiff, they must elect their remedy. Often the imposition of the\nconstructive trust can be a viable option, but the plaintiff will usually have to forgo\nany damages that may be awarded. Counsel will have to evaluate both the benefits\nand consequences of electing the most favorable remedy.”).\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 37\n\fno writ) (“When a trustee has commingled funds and has expended funds, the money\n\nexpended is presumed to be the trustee's own.”); Batmanis v. Batmanis, 600 S.W.2d\n\n887, 890 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1980, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (“And where,\n\nas here, the trustee comingles trust money with his own and money is expended, it\n\nwill be presumed that his own money is expended first”); General Ass'n of Davidian\n\nS.D.A. v. General Ass'n, Etc., 410 S.W.2d 256, 259 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1966,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.). The Final Judgment does not take into account this rule of law and\n\nthe presumption was not rebutted by Appellee.\n\n      49.    The evidence from Appellee suggests that $100,452.53 was deposited\n\ninto account 8533 from the sale of the La Playa property and then, the next day,\n\n$100,000 was transferred into the 8739 account. R.R. 15 at 748-49. The balance of\n\nthe 8533 account just before the transfer was $103,994.76 of which $100,452.53 was\n\nfrom the sale of the La Playa property and the balance, $3,542.23, were Appellant’s\n\nfunds. Because of the foregoing rule, the first $3,542.23 transferred to the 8739\n\naccount was Appellant’s and only the balance of $96,457.77 in the $100,000 transfer\n\ncould be attributable to the La Playa sale. As to the 8739 account, there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that a “[c]onstructive trust\n\nof $100,000 results [sic] at this time. July 2013.” C.R. at 1685.\n\n      50.    Several months later, $188,244.59 was transferred into the 8533\n\naccount from the sale of Appellant’s former homestead at 331 Hunter’s Glen in San\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 38\n\fMarcos, Texas – the Hunter’s Glen property – and the next day, $188,000 was\n\ntransferred to the 8739 account.        Id. at 752-53.       The trial court’s findings\n\nacknowledge that the $188,000 was proceeds from the sale of Appellant’s property.\n\nWhen the $201,000 was transferred out of the 8739 account for the purchase of\n\nAppellant’s home at 4919 West Frances Place in Austin, the balance in the 8739\n\naccount was $278,008.89. Id. at 760 (balance on July 2 was $77,008.89 after the\n\n$201,000 withdrawal). Using the rule referred to above, of the $201,000 paid for\n\nthe West Frances Place home, $188,000 was Appellant’s and only $13,000 could be\n\nattributable to the sale of the La Playa property.\n\n      51.    Even if the court were to find that the RR 12 property was not a gift and\n\nthat a constructive trust should be applied to the proceeds from the sale of that\n\nproperty, the $206,007.09 that could be attributable to the sale of the RR 12 property\n\ntaken together with the $13,000 traceable as proceeds from the sale of the La Playa\n\nproperty – a total of $219,007.09 – does not support a constructive trust in the\n\namount of $306,007.09.\n\n     The Constructive Trust on the Mercedes Benz for $12,182.36 is Improper\n\n      52.     As discussed in paragraph 48 above, with respect to “commingled”\n\naccounts, it is presumed that the first funds drawn out were personal funds. The trial\n\ncourt found that in September 2012, a deposit of $55,752.81 was made into account\n\n8533. C.R. at 1685. From the evidence this appears to be a typographical error\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 39\n\fbecause on August 31, 2012 $50,752.81 was deposited into account 8533. RR Vol.\n\n15 at 739. The trial court found this deposit was attributable to the sale of the Park\n\nPlace property. Id. The records do reflect a transfer of $55,000 to account 8739 on\n\nSeptember 4, 2012. Id. at 740-41. However, after the transfer of the $55,000 on\n\nSeptember 4, the balance of the 8533 account was $7,567.94, meaning that under\n\nthe first out rule, the most of the $50,752.81 proceeds from the sale of the Park Place\n\nproperty that could have been transferred to the 8739 account was $43,184.8717 and\n\ntherefore remaining $11,815.13 out of the $55,000 was attributable to Appellant’s\n\nfunds. Id. at 739.\n\n         53.   The balance in the 8739 account just before the time of the $55,000\n\ndeposit was $10,421.53 [Id. at 741 (September 4, 2012 daily balance of $65,421.53\n\nless $55,000 transferred)] and after the deposit the amount in that account\n\nattributable to Appellant was $22,236.66.18 The evidence shows that between the\n\ndeposit on September 4, 2012 and the payment made to Mercedes Benz Financial\n\non September 9, 2012 in the amount of $12,182.36, the balance in the 8739 account\n\nexceeded the amount attributable to the proceeds from the sale of the Park Place\n\nproperty by more than the payment to Mercedes Benz Financial and, under the first\n\n\n\n17\n     $50,752.81 - $7,567.94.\n18\n     The sum of $11,815.13 and $10,421.53.\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 40\n\fout presumption, establishes that funds separately attributable to Appellant were\n\nused to make the payment to Mercedes Benz.\n\n      54.    There is insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that a\n\n“[c]onstructive trust of $12,182.36 [was] created” or that there was “no evidence by\n\n[Appellant] that funds other than Edna Moon’s funds were used for this payoff.”\n\nC.R. at 1685-86.      The record itself establishes that the imposition of such\n\nconstructive trust in the Final Judgment is improper under the first out rule.\n\nI.    The Final Judgment Improperly Places a Claim on Appellant’s\n      Homestead.\n\n      55.    “Constitutional homestead rights protect citizens from losing their\n\nhomes, and statutes relating to homestead rights are liberally construed to protect the\n\nhomestead.” Fairfield Financial Group, Inc. v. Synott, 300 S.W.3d 316, 320 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2009, no pet). A homestead is exempt from seizure for the claims of\n\ncreditors except for encumbrances properly fixed on homestead property. TEX. PROP.\n\nCODE § 41.001(a). As this Court has further noted in Fairfield, the Property Code\n\nlists the types of encumbrances that may be properly fixed upon homestead property,\n\nwhich includes purchase money liens. Id. § 41.001(b)(1). Based on the foregoing,\n\neven if there is evidence in this case warranting imposition of a constructive trust\n\nbased on a purchase money type lien, the scope of the purchase money used for the\n\nAppellant’s homestead has not been properly established and therefore the\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 41\n\f“constructive trust lien” imposed on Appellant’s homestead in the Final Judgment is\n\nimproper.\n\n      56.    In addition, the RR 12 property was a gift to Appellant and there is\n\ninsufficient proper evidence to set that conveyance aside and to impose a\n\nconstructive trust on the proceeds from the sale of that property. Accordingly, for\n\nthis additional reason the constructive trust of $206,007.09 against Appellant’s\n\nhomestead is improper.\n\nJ.    The Trial Court Erred in Using the Improper Measure of Damages When\n      the Joint Account Agreements Specifically Identified the Allocation of\n      Ownership of Such Joint Accounts and the Court Did Not Take Into\n      Consideration the Appellant’s Contractual Ownership Interest in Those\n      Joint Accounts.\n\n      57.    The Appellee had the burden to establish the proper measure of\n\ndamages. See generally, W.O. Bankston Nissan v. Walters, 754 S.W.2d 127, 128\n\n(Tex. 1988) (“Walters' burden of proof in this case was to show either the difference\n\nbetween the fair market value of the pickup as delivered and the value of the truck\n\nas it was represented; or the difference in value between that with which he parted\n\nand that which he received. He did neither. Walters had the burden of requesting\n\njury issues on the proper measure of damages. Having failed to do so, his cause of\n\naction must fail.”). Further, “[w]hen the injury is only the economic loss to the\n\nsubject of a contract itself, the action sounds in contract alone.\" Jim Walter Homes,\n\nInc. v. Reed, 711 S.W.2d 617, 618 (Tex. 1986); see also Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v.\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 42\n\fDeLanney, 809 S.W.2d 493, 494 (Tex. 1991) (\"When the only loss or damage is to\n\nthe subject matter of the contract, the plaintiff's action is ordinarily on the contract.\").\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has “repeatedly reaffirmed this rule.” LAN/STV v. Martin\n\nK. Eby Constr. Co., 435 S.W.3d 234, 242 n.35 (Tex. 2014).\n\n        58.    As discussed above,19 Howard Moon, Edna Moon, and Appellant\n\nentered into contractual joint account agreements governing the use and ownership\n\nof the Frost Bank joint accounts ending in 8650 and 9898. See C.R. 1406 and 1407.\n\nThese accounts were created as multi-party accounts with right of survivorship\n\nwhereby the parties agreed they owned the accounts in proportion to their\n\ncontributions to the account, that Frost Bank could pay any sum in the account to a\n\nparty at any time, and on the death of a party, the deceased party’s ownership of the\n\naccount passes to the surviving parties. Id. The subject matter of the Appellee’s\n\nclaims was, in large part, for economic losses arising out of alleged misuse of funds\n\nin these accounts (in particular the account ending in 9898). Appellee and the Final\n\nJudgment made no attempt to allocate damages based on the parties’ contractual\n\nagreements20 and violated the economic loss rule by attempting to convert such\n\nactual damages arising out of contract into tort damages/claims.\n\n\n\n19\n     See paragraph 18.\n20\n  For example, the Appellee has taken the position that none of the funds in the joint\naccounts was Appellant’s. However, even if Appellant made no contributions to the\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 43\n\fK.    The Trial Court Erred in “Setting Aside” and Declaring “Void and\n      Without Effect” the Gift Deeds Because There is No or Insufficient\n      Evidence of Fraudulent Inducement of Those Deeds by Appellant and the\n      Final Judgment Improperly Clouds Title of Non-Parties.\n\n            Insufficient Evidence of Fraudulent Inducement of a Contract\n\n      59.    The Appellee asserted an untimely claim for fraudulent inducement.\n\nThe trial court overruled Appellant’s special exception to the claim seeking to\n\nrequire Appellee to identify the contractual agreement. See C.R. 1609 (special\n\nexception) and 1638 (order). However, in order to make a claim for fraudulent\n\ninducement, Appellee needed to prove the existence of a contractual agreement. It\n\nhas been held that:\n\n      In order to bring a claim for fraud in the inducement, a plaintiff must show\n      the elements of fraud and must show that she has been fraudulently induced\n      to enter into a binding agreement.\n\nIn re Guardianship of Patlan, 350 S.W.2d 189, 198 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011,\n\nno pet.), citing, Haase v. Glazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 798 (Tex. 2001) (“Without a\n\nbinding agreement, there is no detrimental reliance, and thus no fraudulent\n\ninducement claim. That is, when a party has not incurred a contractual obligation,\n\nit has not been induced to do anything.”). In this case the trial court should not have\n\nallowed the untimely filing and should not have overruled the Appellant’s special\n\n\n\n\n9898 account, on Howard Moon’s death, his interest in the account would have\npassed 50% to Edna Moon and 50% to Appellant.\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 44\n\fexception. The only “contracts” referred to by the Appellant as the Gift Deeds.\n\nThere was no pleading identifying the joint account agreements as being\n\nfraudulently induced. There was no specific “contract” identified and there is no\n\nevidence or insufficient evidence of any contract that Edna Moon was induced to\n\nsign by Appellant.\n\n      60.    There also is insufficient evidence of a fiduciary relationship to support\n\nany presumption of fraudulent intent. Further, as noted above, the parol evidence\n\nrule and statute of frauds would also tend to prohibit testimony that contradicts\n\nevidence in the recorded gift deeds or the purpose for them. In this case, both the\n\nGift Deeds to Appellant provide for the consideration as love and affection for\n\nAppellant and there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to set aside the stated\n\nconsideration.\n\n            The Final Judgment Improperly Clouded Title of Non-Parties\n\n      61.    A party should not be granted relief in the absence of pleadings that\n\nsupport that relief. See Cunningham v. Parkdale Bank, 660 S.W.2d 810, 813 (Tex.\n\n1983). Hence, a judgment after a trial on the merits that is not supported by the\n\npleadings is improper. See Wielgosz v. Millard, 679 S.W.2d 163, 166 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1984, no writ).\n\n\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 45\n\f         62.   Despite there being no specific request for such relief,21 the Final\n\nJudgment orders that the Gift Deeds of the RR 12 property and the Rest Haven\n\nproperty are set aside, void, and without effect. C.R. 1640, 1641. However, the\n\nPlaintiff did not join the current owners of these properties whose rights were are\n\nissue and whose title is now clouded. Rule 39, like the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n\nmandates joinder of persons whose interests would be affected by the judgment. See\n\nBrooks v. Northglen Ass’n, 141 S.W.3d 158, 162 (Tex. 2004), citing, Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code § 37.006 (\"When declaratory relief is sought, all persons who have or\n\nclaim any interest that would be affected by the declaration must be made parties.\")\n\n(emphasis added); TEX. R. CIV. P. 39(a) (\"A person who is subject to service of\n\nprocess shall be joined as a party in the action if ... he claims an interest relating to\n\nthe subject of the action ....\") (emphasis added). Because Plaintiff had not pled for\n\nthis specific relief, the trial court should not have rendered the Gift Deeds void. See\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 56 (“When items of special damages are claimed, they shall be\n\nspecifically stated”); see also, Lone Star Gas Co. v. Childress, 187 S.W.2d 936, 939\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1945, no writ) (“We think the rule in Texas is 'that in order\n\nto warrant a court of equity to grant injunctive relief, the petitioner must specify the\n\nprecise relief sought and a court is without jurisdiction to grant relief beyond and in\n\n\n\n21\n     See Plaintiff’s Fifth Amended Petition, at 9 (“Damages and Relief Requested”).\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 46\n\faddition to that particularly specified.”) (citations omitted). The Appellee’s prayer\n\ncontrolled the nature of the relief the trial court could grant and the Final Judgment\n\ncannot properly grant relief not prayed for by Appellee.\n\n      63.    The Trial Court erred in entering a Final Judgment that exceeded the\n\nscope of relief prayed for by Plaintiff. Based on the relief entered by the trial court,\n\nthe current owners of the RR 12 and Rest Haven properties (the Gift Deed properties)\n\nwere necessary parties needed for a just adjudication. See generally Bennett v.\n\nGrant, 460 S.W.3d 220, 239 (Tex. App.—Austin 2015, pet. filed) (“Thus, non-\n\nparties must be joined as additional defendants to a counterclaim if in their absence\n\ncomplete relief cannot be afforded among the parties.”); see also, TEX. R. CIV. P. 39\n\nand 97.\n\nL.    The $1,000,000 Punitive Damages Award is Excessive in Light of the\n      Facts and Sanctions Order.\n\n      64.    Given the contractual nature of the underlying issues in this case\n\ndiscussed in paragraphs 18 and 58 above, and the double recovery issues addressed\n\nin paragraphs 40-46 above, there is insufficient evidence to support the imposition\n\nof punitive damages. Because of that, the award of punitive damages is excessive\n\nand an unconstitutional and unreasonable penalty and punishment in light of the facts\n\nof this case, particularly when taken in consideration of the extreme scope of the\n\nsanctions imposed against Appellant by way of the Sanctions Order.\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 47\n\fM.    The Final Judgment Refers to an Improper Authority for Assessment of\n      Pre- and Post-Judgement Interest.\n\n      65.    The Final Judgment incorrectly bases its award of $229.856.82 in pre-\n\njudgment interest based on §304.003 of the Texas Finance Code because which is a\n\npost-judgement interest rate provision and incorrectly bases its award of post-\n\njudgment interest based on §304.103 of the Texas Finance Code which is a pre-\n\njudgement interest provision. C.R. at 1643. However, the similarities in the actual\n\npre- and post- judgment rates, makes complaint more technical than substantive.\n\n                         CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      The trial court erred in awarding Appellee the full scope of the death penalty\n\nsanctions and the damages set out in the Final Judgment. Accordingly, this Court\n\nshould reverse the Sanctions Order and Final Judgment for the reasons set out above.\n\nAppellant requests all such other and further relief to which she might be entitled.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n                                       _______________________\n                                       David Junkin\n                                       State Bar No. 11058020\n                                       P.O.

EFFECT OF SIGNING PLEADINGS, MOTIONS AND OTHER\nPAPERS; SANCTIONS\n\nThe signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them that they have\nread the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their knowledge,\ninformation, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not\ngroundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of\nharassment. Attorneys or parties who shall bring a fictitious suit as an experiment to\nget an opinion of the court, or who shall file any fictitious pleading in a cause for\nsuch a purpose, or shall make statements in pleading which they know to be\ngroundless and false, for the purpose of securing a delay of the trial of the cause,\nshall be held guilty of a contempt. If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in\nviolation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, after notice\nand hearing, shall impose an appropriate sanction available under Rule 215-2b, upon\nthe person who signed it, a represented party, or both.\n\nCourts shall presume that pleadings, motions, and other papers are filed in good\nfaith. No sanctions under this rule may be imposed except for good cause, the\nparticulars of which must be stated in the sanction order. \"Groundless\" for purposes\nof this rule means no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good faith argument\nfor the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. A general denial does\nnot constitute a violation of this rule. The amount requested for damages does not\nconstitute a violation of this rule.\n\n                                     Notes and Comments\n\nComment to 1990 change: To require notice and hearing before a court determines to impose\nsanctions, to specify that any sanction imposed be appropriate, and to eliminate the 90-day “grace\"\nperiod provided in the former version of the rule.\n\fRULE 39. JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION\n\n(a) Persons to Be Joined If Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process\nshall be joined as a party in the action if\n\n      (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already\n      parties, or\n\n      (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated\n      that the disposition of the action in his absence may\n\n             (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that\n             interest or\n\n             (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk\n             of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by\n             reason of his claimed interest. If he has not been so joined, the court\n             shall order that he be made a party. If he should join as a plaintiff but\n             refuses to do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an\n             involuntary plaintiff.\n\n(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder Not Feasible. If a person as\ndescribed in subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall\ndetermine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among\nthe parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded\nas indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what\nextent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to him or\nthose already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the\njudgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened\nor avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be\nadequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is\ndismissed for non-joinder.\n\n(c) Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder. A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall\nstate the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as described in subdivision\n(a)(1)-(2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.\n\n(d) Exception of Class Actions. This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 42.\n\fRULE 56. SPECIAL DAMAGE\n\nWhen items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.\n\fRULE 97. COUNTERCLAIM AND CROSS-CLAIM\n\n(a) Compulsory Counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim\nwithin the jurisdiction of the court, not the subject of a pending action, which at the\ntime of filing the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out\nof the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's\nclaim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom\nthe court cannot acquire jurisdiction; provided, however, that a judgment based upon\na settlement or compromise of a claim of one party to the transaction or occurrence\nprior to a disposition on the merits shall not operate as a bar to the continuation or\nassertion of the claims of any other party to the transaction or occurrence unless the\nlatter has consented in writing that said judgment shall operate as a bar.\n\n(b) Permissive Counterclaims. A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim\nagainst an opposing party whether or not arising out of the transaction or occurrence\nthat is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.\n\n(c) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim. A counterclaim may or may not\ndiminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief\nexceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the\nopposing party, so long as the subject matter is within the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n(d) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading. A claim which either\nmatured or was acquired by the pleader after filing his pleading may be presented as\na counterclaim by amended pleading.\n\n(e) Cross-Claim Against Co-Party. A pleading may state as a cross-claim any\nclaim by one party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence that\nis the subject matter either of the original action or of a counterclaim therein. Such\ncross-claim may include a claim that the party against whom it is asserted is or may\nbe liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against\nthe cross-claimant.\n\n(f) Additional Parties. Persons other than those made parties to the original action\nmay be made parties to a third party action, counterclaim or cross-claim in\naccordance with the provisions of Rules 38, 39 and 40.\n\n(g) Tort shall not be the subject of set-off or counterclaim against a contractual\ndemand nor a contractual demand against tort unless it arises out of or is incident to\nor is connected with same.\n\f(h) Separate Trials; Separate Judgments. If the court orders separate trials as\nprovided in Rule 174, judgment on a counterclaim or cross-claim may be rendered\nwhen the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party\nhave been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.\n\f215.1 Motion for Sanctions or Order Compelling Discovery.\n\nA party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all other persons affected\nthereby, may apply for sanctions or an order compelling discovery as follows:\n\n(a) Appropriate court.

If the court denies the motion in whole or in part, it may\n             make such protective order as it would have been empowered to make\n             on a motion pursuant to Rule 192.6.\n\n(c) Evasive or incomplete answer. For purposes of this subdivision an evasive or\nincomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer.\n\n(d) Disposition of motion to compel: award of expenses. If the motion is granted,\nthe court shall, after opportunity for hearing, require a party or deponent whose\nconduct necessitated the motion or the party or attorney advising such conduct or\nboth of them to pay, at such time as ordered by the court, the moving party the\nreasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including attorney fees, unless\nthe court finds that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that\nother circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Such an order shall be\nsubject to review on appeal from the final judgment.\n\nIf the motion is denied, the court may, after opportunity for hearing, require the\nmoving party or attorney advising such motion to pay to the party or deponent who\nopposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion,\nincluding attorney fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was\nsubstantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\nIf the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may apportion the\nreasonable expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the parties and persons\nin a just manner.\n\nIn determining the amount of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, to be\nawarded in connection with a motion, the trial court shall award expenses which are\nreasonable in relation to the amount of work reasonably expended in obtaining an\norder compelling compliance or in opposing a motion which is denied.\n\n(e) Providing person's own statement. If a party fails to comply with any person's\nwritten request for the person's own statement as provided in Rule 192.3(h), the\nperson who made the request may move for an order compelling compliance. If the\n\fmotion is granted, the movant may recover the expenses incurred in obtaining the\norder, including attorney fees, which are reasonable in relation to the amount of work\nreasonably expended in obtaining the order.\n\n215.2 Failure to Comply with Order or with Discovery Request.\n\n(a) Sanctions by court in district where deposition is taken.

Such an order shall be subject to review on appeal from\n      the final judgment.\n\n(c) Sanction against nonparty for violation of Rules 196.7 or 205.3. If a nonparty\nfails to comply with an order under Rules 196.7 or 205.3, the court which made the\norder may treat the failure to obey as contempt of court.\n\n215.3 Abuse of Discovery Process in Seeking, Making, or Resisting Discovery.\n\nIf the court finds a party is abusing the discovery process in seeking, making or\nresisting discovery or if the court finds that any interrogatory or request for\ninspection or production is unreasonably frivolous, oppressive, or harassing, or that\na response or answer is unreasonably frivolous or made for purposes of delay, then\nthe court in which the action is pending may, after notice and hearing, impose any\nappropriate sanction authorized by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8) of Rule\n215.2(b).

The court shall make the order unless it finds that (1) the\nrequest was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 193, or (2) the admission sought\nwas of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing to admit had a reasonable\nground to believe that he might prevail on the matter, or (4) there was other good\nreason for the failure to admit.\n\n215.5 Failure of Party or Witness to Attend to or Serve Subpoena; Expenses.\n\n(a) Failure of party giving notice to attend.

If a party gives notice of the taking of an oral\ndeposition of a witness and the witness does not attend because of the fault of the\nparty giving the notice, if another party attends in person or by attorney because he\nexpects the deposition of that witness to be taken, the court may order the party\ngiving the notice to pay such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him\nand his attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n215.6 Exhibits to Motions and Responses.\n\nMotions or responses made under this rule may have exhibits attached including\naffidavits, discovery pleadings, or any other documents.\n\fNON-MONETARY RELIEF, EQUITABLE RELIEF\n\n\n\n\n    WILLIAM W.

Presumably, the Supreme Court would\nextend this requirement to other codes that may appear\nto codify the common law remedy of rescission.\nLikewise, the inability to place the parties back in their\noriginal positions could be considered as a basis for\ndenying rescission.

The petition alleged: “Defendants\nhad not consulted with Plaintiffs nor had they asked for\npermission to erect such construction knowing fully well\nthat the play set had been erected in violation of the\nresidential deed and to intentionally harass and disrupt\nPlaintiffs' life.” The Brozyinskis did not allege that the\nKerneys had a duty to secure their permission to erect the\nplay set; they alleged (as explained in detail in Kathy's\naffidavit) that the Kerneys had not received permission to\nbreach the subdivision's deed restrictions by building such a\nlarge wooden structure. At the hearing, Appellants argued\nthat this allegation was that the Kerneys were required to\nobtain the permission of the subdivision's architectural\nguidelines committee. Finally, as part of the trespass claim,\nthe petition alleged that the play set's hooks had been\nattached to the Brozynskis' fence and thus was an invasion\n(i.e., without permission) of the Brozynskis' property, and\nKathy's affidavit described that damage that the play set's\nhooks had caused to the Brozynskis' fence.\n\n[2] We note that Rule 13 uses the obligatory term “must”\nfor the trial court's duty to state the good cause particulars\nin the sanction order.

Thus, because the property owners had actual              Although we reverse\nnotice, Northglen asserts, the late charge should also run\nwith the land as the interest charge does.

First   ground and sufficient width for trucks and cars to go on the\nof all, the right-of-way deeds are clear, Plaintiffs do not        ground for maintenance purposes and wide enough for any\nallege any ambiguity in said deeds, nor do they allege any         purpose the Gas Company might have on plaintiffs'\nfraud, accident or mistake between the parties in the              property and that the graded thirty foot right-of-way was a\nexecution of the grants. In fact, the original grantors were       more convenient means of ingress and egress and that the\nnot parties to the action and the deeds were executed and          Gas Company would stay on this right-of-way if plaintiffs\nrecorded and fixed the rights of the parties before the            wanted them to do so, the trial court was justified in finding\nplaintiffs purchased the property. There is nothing in the         that a right-of-way thirty feet wide was all that defendant's\npleading of plaintiffs, nor in their prayer for relief, to put     convenience and necessity required. We do not so\ndefendant on notice that plaintiffs would seek to limit            understand that law. First of all, the right-of-way deeds did\ndefendant's use of their lands to a strip of land thirty feet      not\nwide. We think the rule in Texas is 'that in order to warrant\n                                                                   Page 940\na court of equity to grant injunctive relief, the petitioner\nmust specify the precise relief sought and a court is without      stipulate that the defendant should confine its operations to\njurisdiction to grant relief beyond and in addition to that        a strip of land thirty feet wide. The deeds, among other\nparticularly specified.' Fletcher v. King, Tex.Civ.App., 75        things, granted to the defendant 'the right-of-way and\nS.W.2d 980, point 1 p. 982 (writ ref.), and cases therein          easement to construct, maintain and operate pipe lines and\ncited.

As before\nanchors over and through the following described lands * *       stated, there was no complaint of the use made of plaintiffs'\n* so long as such lines and appurtenances thereto shall be       property by defendant until the pipe line was removed. The\nmaintained, with ingress to and egress from the premises,        injunction suit was filed after the defendant refused to pay\nfor the purpose of constructing, inspecting, repairing,          the damages claimed by plaintiffs. The damages assessed\nmaintaining and replacing the property of Grantee, above         by the trial court are not assailed by plaintiffs as being\ndescribed, and the removal of such at will, in whole or in       inadequate to recompense them for damages sustained. We\npart. * * * Should more than one pipe line be laid under this    think the rule is: 'An application for injunction is uniformly\ngrant at any time, the sum of twenty-five cents per lineal       subjected to a strict construction. * * * Mere uncertainty or\nrod for each additional line shall be paid, besides the          mere apprehension of injury is not sufficient.'

Since the deeds do not confine the            Browning v. Hinerman, Tex.Civ.App., 224 S.W. 236. Again:\ndefendant's use to a strip of land thirty feet wide, it is       'It is held that an injunction will not lie to prevent an alleged\nelementary that the court could not re-define the terms of       threatened act, the commission of which is speculative and\nthe grant and restrict the use granted by the instruments on     the injury from which is purely conjectural.'

It is clear to us that the amount of space           court's judgment the defendant would be required to seek\nreasonably needed in the past in any particular operation is     the aid of the\na question of fact, and the testimony of the district foreman\non such issue would be pertinent. But the defendant is           Page 941\nentitled to use in the future as much of the land as each\noccasion may reasonably demand, and such testimony does          court each time its operations may require the use of a strip\nnot authorize the court to deprive the defendant of what has     of land more than thirty feet wide. We think such action of\nbeen legally granted to it by the terms of the right-of-way      the court restricts the provisions of the right-of-way deeds\ndeeds.

Appellant further contends that the court erred in\n                                                                 finding that plaintiffs should recover from the defendants\n      Appellees further contend substantially that they are      the sum of $500. As a basis for this contention defendant\nentitled to injunctive relief because plaintiffs use the         says 'that there is no evidence, or at least the evidence is\npremises for a stock ranch; that it is highly improved for       insufficient, to support the judgment for damages * * *\nstock raising; that plaintiffs are engaged in raising both       because of a lack of evidence showing that the alleged\nregistered and grade cattle; and that defendant, while           damages were personally caused by the negligence of the\nengaged in removing said pipe line, failed to close said         defendant.' For rule of law, see Lone Star Gas Co. v.\ngates and thereby permitted an indiscriminate mixing of the\n                                                                 Hutton, Tex.Com.App., 58 S.W.2d 19, points 10-11. We\nregistered and grade cattle, thereby interfering with            overrule this contention. The award was in a lump sum of\nbreeding purposes; and that such injuries are irreparable and    $500. Appellees sued for various items of damages\nthat legal remedies are inadequate and that such conduct         aggregating $892, the three principal items being (a) injury\n\fto land $250; (b) damage to fences $350; (c) damage to\nsurface tank $75. We have carefully reviewed the evidence\non these items and we think that it is sufficient to support\nthe implied finding of the trial court that the damages were\ncaused by the negligence of the Gas Company and\nsufficient to support the amount awarded. We feel that it\nwould unduly extend this opinion to review the evidence as\nto damages and we do not believe it would serve any useful\npurpose to do so. The damages to the land and to the fences\nand to the water tank are clear and it was a question of fact\nfor the trial court to determine whether or not such damages\nwere due to the negligence of the defendant, as well as to\nfind the amount.\n\n       It follows from what we have said that we are of the\nopinion that the trial court erred in issuing the injunction\nand that this injunction must be dissolved. It further\nappearing to us that the cause has been fully developed,\nthere is no occasion to reverse and remand the cause and the\njudgment with respect to the injunction must be reversed\nand rendered. It further appears to us that the judgment\nawarding damages to plaintiffs in the sum of $500 must be\nsustained and the judgment of the trial court in this respect\nis affirmed.\n\n      Accordingly, the judgment as to the injunction granted\nis reversed and rendered and the judgment of the trial court\nawarding damages to the plaintiffs is in all things affirmed.\n\n      We are further of the opinion that it would be\nequitable for the costs incurred in the trial court to be\nadjudged against the defendant and the costs incurred on\nthis appeal to be adjudged equally against appellant and\nappellees, and it is so ordered.

R. Civ. P. 193.6(c). The State moved for a continuance\n\fseveral times during trial, but each time the trial court\ndenied the motion. While the State does not complain of\nthese rulings in this appeal, we note that the obvious\npurpose of Rule 193.6(c) is to alleviate the harshness of the\nexclusion of evidence by vesting the trial court with\ndiscretion to grant a continuance in situations where a party\nsuch as Target files a motion to exclude an opponent's\ncritical evidence on the eve of trial.\n\n[5] Target argues that, irrespective of the Rule 193.6\nanalysis, any error by the trial court was harmless because\nthe trial court should have granted Target's motion to\nexclude Lovett's testimony on the 20% utilization factor on\nthe ground that it was unreliable under a Daubert/Robinson\nanalysis. We review a trial court's ruling on the\nadmissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.\nExxon Pipeline Co. v. Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d 623, 629 (Tex.\n2002).\n\nTarget argued in the trial court that Lovett's methodology\nbehind his 20% utilization factor was flawed because in\ncalculating the loss in net operating income per lost parking\nspace, he did not consider the income attributable to those\nspaces during peak volume periods, but instead considered\nthe average income per space over the course of a year.\nLovett testified that he properly used the average income\nper space because net operating income was based on rental\nincome that did not vary during the year. He said that he\nhad used this methodology before and had observed other\nappraisers use it. The State also offered evidence that\nTarget's own appraisal expert had utilized the same\nmethodology in other appraisals. The trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying Target's motion to exclude\nLovett's testimony as unreliable.\n\n[6] Because we have sustained the State's first issue, we\nneed not address its second issue, which complains that the\ntrial court abused its discretion because its rulings were\ntantamount to a death-penalty sanction. We do note,\nhowever, that authority supports the State's position that a\ndue process analysis under TransAmerican Nat. Gas Corp.\nv. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913 (Tex. 1991), is appropriate when\napplication of the discovery rules results in\nmerits-preclusive or death-penalty sanctions. See, e.g.,\nWheeler v.

See 12\nC.F.R. § 226.12(b)-2,3 (1995). To begin with, we do not\nfind any language in the Commentary remotely resembling\nSpeigel/FCNB's contention, much less requiring a\ncardholder to return a form sent to it by the card issuer. But,\nbeyond this fundamental problem with the argument, the\nissue here is not whether the card issuer could obtain\nwritten information from Mattly. The issue is whether\nMattly, someone who had been the victim of credit card\nabuse on numerous occasions, acted in bad faith when she\nrefused to return a form (which requested confidential\ninformation) to a company her investigator could not locate\nthrough normal investigative channels. Citing to the same\ncommentary, Spiegel/FCNB also argue that if the\ncardholder fails to comply with these requests from a card\nissuer, the card issuer can terminate its investigation and\n\"seek payment from the cardholder.\" Our reading of the\nCommentary does not reveal any explicit support for this\nstatement.\n\n[6] Spiegel and FCNB did not raise preemption.\n\n[7] Mattly took no action to cause Spiegel and FCNB's legal\nfees to reach nearly $70,000, unlike some frivolous actions\nin which a party will file numerous motions and discovery\nrequests that inflate the fees.\n\n---------\n\fPage 694                                                  Appellant R.M.

The property\nwhich we are concerned with is property subject to a trust in\nfavor of 'Second Tithe' contributors; and Articles 2293 et\nseq., V.A.T.S. are inapplicable.\n\n    Plaintiff's 3rd contention is that the trial court erred in\nnot applying the cy pres doctrine. The cy pres doctrine\napplies to a charitable trust, and has no application here.\nThis trust is not charitable. This is a trust, the assets of\nwhich were to give old age protection to the contributors.\n\n    Plaintiff's 4th contention is that the trial court erred in\npermitting the trust to fail for want of a trustee. The trial\ncourt did not permit the trust to fail for want of a trustee.\nWhen the association became defunct and broke up, the\naccomplishment of the trust became impossible. (Plaintiff\nhas only 6 members; intervenors but few more; some 8\ngroups claim to be successors to the old association). If the\npurposes of a valid trust, as here, become impossible of\naccomplishment, the trust will be terminated.

Maresca,\nDist.] 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.); TEX.PROB.CODE ANN. § 5             362 S.W.2d at 300-301. The Court in Maresca stated:\n\f     The assumption is implicit in the opinions of this court\nthat a trial judge will discriminate in ordering discovery\nbetween information disclosed by income tax returns which\nis relevant and material to the matters in controversy and\ninformation which is not. The protection of privacy is of\nfundamental--indeed,        of     constitutional--importance.\nSubjecting federal income tax returns of our citizens to\ndiscovery is sustainable only because the pursuit of justice\nbetween litigants outweighs protection of their privacy. But\nsacrifice of the latter should be kept to the minimum, and\nthis requires scrupulous limitation of discovery to\ninformation furthering justice between the parties which, in\nturn, can only be information of relevancy and materiality\nto the matters in controversy. Id. at 301.\n\n    We see no reason to exclude Relator's other personal\nfinancial records, such as her financial statements and\nrecords of household accounts from similar considerations.\n\n     We therefore hold Judge Millard abused his discretion\nin ordering Relator to produce her entire tax returns,\nfinancial statements, and personal household records\nwithout examining them and separating the relevant parts\nfrom the irrelevant. As stated in Maresca, 362 S.W.2d at\n301, it is not this court's function to supervise the trial judge\nin exercising his discretion in his rulings on relevancy and\nmateriality. However, we should grant extraordinary relief\nwhen no discretion has been exercised, as in the case before\nus.\n\n     We feel certain the trial judge will act in a manner\nconsistent with this opinion and that it will be unnecessary\nfor a writ of mandamus to issue at this time. However, in\nthe event he fails to do so, a writ will\n\nPage 168\n\nissue to insure compliance with this opinion.\n\n---------\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] ...

If so, its liquidation would be necessary in order to         empowered to sell the property and consume any principal\n\fnecessary to maintain her in her accustomed standard of\nliving. Appellant had the burden to bring forth evidence that\nher mother exceeded her authority. This, she has failed to\ndo. Points of error six through ten are overruled.\n\n     In her eleventh point of error, appellant complains of\nthe trial court's refusal to impose a constructive trust on her\none-fourth share of the specific real property conveyed.\nConstructive fraud (necessitating a constructive trust) is\ndefined as a breach of a legal or equitable duty which,\nregardless of moral guilt, the law considers\n\nPage 937\n\nfraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others, violate\nconfidence or injure public interests. Becknal v. Atwood,\n518 S.W.2d 593, 598 (Tex.Civ.App.--Amarillo 1975, no\nwrit).\n\n      The only evidence of any breach of fiduciary duty in\nthis case was the fact that Helen Pitts closed out the trust\naccount and commingled that money with her own funds. If\na trustee commingles trust funds with the trustee's own, the\nentire commingled fund is subject to the trust. General\nAssociation of Davidian Seventh Day Adventists, Inc. v.\nGeneral Association of Davidian Seventh Day Adventists,\n410 S.W.2d 256, 259 (Tex.Civ.App.--Waco 1966, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.). When a trustee has commingled funds and has\nexpended funds, the money expended is presumed to be the\ntrustee's own. Batmanis v. Batmanis, 600 S.W.2d 887, 890\n(Tex.Civ.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\nThus, upon Helen Pitts' death, all commingled funds in her\nbank account, along with any of the trust property not sold\nor consumed, will be subject to an undivided remainder\ninterest among the children of the testator then surviving.\nAppellant's interest does not attach to certain specific\nproperty, only to the trust corpus, in whatever form, at the\nlife tenant's death. Point of error eleven is overruled.\n\n     We reform the judgment of the trial court to hold: (1)\nthat the testamentary trust under the will of Johnny Thomas\nPitts did not fail due to a merger of the legal and equitable\nestates during the lifetime of Helen Marion Pitts; (2) that,\nunder the will of Johnny Thomas Pitts, Helen Marion Pitts\nwas the executor of the estate, life beneficiary of the\ntestamentary trust, and the trustee of the trust, by which she\nwas vested with all the powers set forth in \"Annex A\" of his\nwill; and (3) that Jacqueline Moody, if she survives Helen\nMarion Pitts, retains an undivided defeasible vested\nremainder interest in the estate and testamentary trust of\nJohnny Thomas Pitts as it may exist at the death of Helen\nMarion Pitts. As reformed, the judgment of the trial court is\naffirmed.\n\fPage 617                                                        v.

City of\nafter hearing argument of counsel but refusing to hear any        Hondo, 721 S.W.2d 839, 840 (Tex.1986). However,\nevidence. Based upon his May 12 order striking                    paragraph 2(b) explicitly requires that any sanctions\nTransAmerican's pleadings, the district court issued an           imposed be \"just\". By referring to paragraph 2(b),\norder on October 6 dismissing TransAmerican's action with         paragraph 3 incorporates the same requirement. Thus,\nprejudice, rendering an interlocutory default judgment            whether the district court imposed sanctions under\nagainst TransAmerican and in favor of Toma on its                 paragraph 2(b) or paragraph 3, we consider whether those\ncounterclaim, and setting the case for trial solely on the        sanctions were just.

First, a direct relationship\nof appeals to compel the district court to set aside his May      must exist between the offensive conduct and the sanction\n12 and October 6 orders. A divided court of appeals denied        imposed. This means that a just sanction must be directed\nTransAmerican leave to file its petition for writ of              against the abuse and toward remedying the prejudice\nmandamus in an unpublished per curiam opinion. [3]                caused the innocent party. It also means that the sanction\nTransAmerican then moved for leave to file its petition in        should be visited upon the offender. The trial court must at\nthis Court. We granted the motion in order to review the          least attempt to determine whether the offensive conduct is\npropriety of the discovery sanctions imposed by the district      attributable to counsel only, or to the party only, or to both.\ncourt.                                                            This we recognize will not be an easy matter in many\n                                                                  instances. On the one hand, a lawyer cannot shield his client\n    II                                                            from sanctions; a party must bear some responsibility for its\n                                                                  counsel's discovery abuses when it is or should be aware of\n     The sanctions imposed by the district court are among        counsel's conduct and the violation of discovery rules. On\nthose authorized for various discovery abuses under Rule          the other hand, a party should not be punished for counsel's\n215 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The district           conduct in which it is not implicated apart from having\ncourt did not specify what provision of Rule 215 it relied        entrusted to counsel its legal representation. The point is,\nupon. The portions of the rule applicable to the                  the sanctions the trial court imposes must relate directly to\ncircumstances here are paragraphs 2(b)(5) and 3. Paragraph        the abuse found.\n2(b)(5) provides in part:\n                                                                      Second, just sanctions must not be excessive. The\n    If a party or an officer ... of a party ... fails to comply   punishment should fit the crime. A sanction imposed for\n\fdiscovery abuse should be no more severe than necessary to       [7]\nsatisfy its legitimate purposes. It follows that courts must\nconsider the availability of less stringent sanctions and             In the present case, it is not clear whether\nwhether such lesser sanctions would fully promote                TransAmerican or its counsel or both should be faulted for\ncompliance.

The trial court's         ---------\norder recites that the sanctions were imposed because\nrelator answered untruthfully in a prior hearing before the\ntrial court concerning the sale of his interest in the Malo\nSueno area. The court found that conduct to be in flagrant\nbad faith in the exercise of his responsibility for discovery,\nan abuse of discovery under Rule 215, and a violation of his\noath as a witness. The actions of relator in this case are not\nto be condoned. However, a trial court may not effectively\nadjudicate the merits of a case based on testimony of a party\nduring a sanctions hearing because he was later impeached\non testimony given at that hearing. The witness' credibility\nshould be tested when the case is tried. Otherwise, a trial\ncourt could at any time interrupt a trial proceeding if it\nbelieved a witness was being untruthful, and simply enter a\ndefault against the party procuring that witness for that\nreason. The statement of relator, whether perjurious or not,\ndoes not go to the heart of the controversy here. It did not\njustify the conclusion that relator's claim lacked merit so\nthat he should be precluded from his day in court.\n\n     We do not believe the action of the trial court was\njustified; the Transamerican factors were not met. There\nwas no showing that lesser sanctions would not have been\neffective. A \"death penalty\" sanction is not proper\npunishment for what was perceived by the court to be\nperjured testimony.\n\n     Mandamus is proper in this instance because the\nactions of the trial court in this case had the effect of\nadjudicating relator's case, but did not result in the rendition\nof an appealable judgment.

The Court finds that the discovery sought is directly,\nmaterially and substantially related to the major issues of\nthe case; Chrysler's refusal to comply with the discovery\nrules and orders of this Court prevent Plaintiffs from\npreparing their case for trial and preclude a fair trial under\n\fPage 725                                                          cable, which was several feet long, had been made by\n                                                                  unwinding the 18\"' flexible sheath that protected the cord of\n856 S.W.2d 725 (Tex. 1993)                                        electric wires connecting a telephone handset to the body of\n                                                                  a pay telephone mounted on the wall outside the grocery\nGTE      COMMUNICATIONS                           SYSTEMS         store.

We have concluded that\nconstructive possession of the document or a right to\n\fGCSC did not fail to comply with discovery. Even in the          district court relied, unless the papers are \"groundless\" as\ndistrict court's view, GCSC only failure was to produce a        defined by the rule. Plaintiffs contend, and the district court\nsingle document which states that \"several ... handset           concluded, that GCSC's amended answers and summary\nfailures have resulted in litigation\" without any indication     judgment motion are groundless because there is no basis in\nof the nature of such litigation or whether personal injuries    fact for GCSC's denial that it was involved in the\nhad occurred. Even if GCSC had failed to comply with             manufacture or distribution of the sheathed cord which\ndiscovery, there is nothing in the record to justify striking    caused plaintiffs' injuries. Plaintiffs make two arguments in\nGCSC's pleadings as a consequence.                               support of their contention.\n\n     Accordingly, we conclude that the district court clearly        Plaintiffs' first argument is that the evidence establishes\nabused its discretion in sanctioning GCSC for an abuse of        as a matter of law that GCSC manufactured the sheathed\nthe discovery process under Rule 215.                            cord, and that GCSC's denial of this fact was therefore\n                                                                 groundless.

GCSC's effort\ndiscretion in imposing sanctions under Rule 13,\nTEX.R.CIV.P. Rule 13 states in pertinent part:                   Page 731\n\n     The signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a         to establish that it was not the manufacturer of the cord was\ncertificate by them that they have read the pleading, motion,    not groundless.\nor other paper; that to the best of their knowledge,\ninformation, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the           Plaintiffs' second argument is that because, at the very\ninstrument is not groundless and brought in bad faith or         least, a fact question existed regarding GCSC's involvement\ngroundless and brought for the purpose of harassment.... If a    in the manufacture and distribution of the sheathed cord,\npleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of this   GCSC's assertion in its motion for summary judgment that\nrule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, after   no such fact question existed was groundless.

While we do not disagree that the filing\n                                                                 of a motion for summary judgment may give rise to\n    Courts shall presume that pleadings, motions, and other      sanctions under Rule 13, just as the filing of any other\npapers are filed in good faith.

At the time\nmay be imposed except for good cause, the particulars of         GCSC filed its motion, the only evidence adduced by the\nwhich must be stated in the sanction order. \"Groundless\" for     parties indicated that GCSC had not made or distributed the\npurposes of this rule means no basis in law or fact and not      sheathed cord. Indeed, plaintiffs themselves originally\nwarranted by good faith argument for the extension,              pleaded that ATS manufactured the cord, not GCSC. By\nmodification, or reversal of existing law.                       their own admission, plaintiffs did not develop any\n                                                                 evidence to contradict GCSC's assertions until after GCSC's\n     The district court sanctioned GCSC for filing amended       motion was denied. Even if GCSC was not entitled to\nanswers, a motion for summary judgment and the                   summary judgment, it cannot be said that its motion had no\nsupporting affidavits of Zimmerman and Jiminez, which            basis in law or fact.\ndeny that GCSC was involved in making or distributing the\nsheathed cord which caused plaintiffs' injuries. By its               Thus, the district court clearly abused its discretion in\nexpress language, Rule 13 applies only to pleadings,             determining that GCSC's assertions were groundless.

Since the          impose sanctions under Rule 13, the district court was also\nZimmerman and Jiminez affidavits were not signed by              required to find that GCSC's assertions were made in bad\nGCSC's attorneys, it was a clear abuse of discretion for the     faith or for the purpose of harassment. Since plaintiffs do\ndistrict court to base an imposition of sanctions under Rule     not contend, and the district court did not find, that GCSC's\n13 on them. The issues, then, are whether the district court     assertions were harassing, a finding of bad faith was a\nabused its discretion GCSC's in concluding that GCSC's           prerequisite to sanctions. Rule 13 prescribes that courts\namended answers and motion for summary judgment are              presume that papers are filed in good faith. Thus, the burden\nsanctionable, and in striking GCSC's pleadings.                  is on the party moving for sanctions to overcome this\n                                                                 presumption. Plaintiffs failed to carry this burden. The only\n     Such papers cannot serve as a basis for sanctions under     basis the district court gave for finding that GCSC had\nthat portion of Rule 13 quoted above, and on which the           acted in bad faith was that GCSC had ignored or concealed\n\fevidence that it had been involved in making and                 TransAmerican, 811 S.W.2d at 920; Chrysler, 841 S.W.2d\ndistributing the sheathed cord that injured the plaintiffs. As   at 845 n. 2. For the same reasons expressed in those cases,\nwe have seen, however, there is no proof that GCSC, before       GCSC has no adequate remedy by appeal in this case, and\nit moved for summary judgment, was aware of any                  we exercise our discretion to issue the extraordinary writ.\nevidence that it was involved in the manufacture or\ndistribution of the sheathed cord.                                    We have held that an assessment of attorney fees which\n                                                                 is not to be paid until final judgment is rendered may be\n     Furthermore, a motion for summary judgment asserting        adequately challenged by appeal.

Nor is denial of      any sanctions at all, there remains no basis for the award of\na motion for summary judgment alone grounds for                  attorney fees.\nsanctions. Rule 13 does not permit sanctions for every\npleading or motion that requests relief which is denied. In          Accordingly, we conclude that GCSC is entitled to\nthis case, the district court abused its discretion in finding   have the district court's sanction order set aside.\nthat GCSC had acted in bad faith.\n                                                                 ******\n     The district court also sanctioned GCSC for asserting in\nits motion for summary judgment that it did not know of               We therefore direct the district court to vacate its orders\nany defects in the sheathed cord and could not have              of November 14, 1991, and June 12, 1992, assessing\nforeseen an accident like plaintiffs', when it was aware of      sanctions and attorney fees.

Rule\n13 requires that sanctions imposed be \"appropriate\", which\nis the equivalent of \"just\" under Rule 215. TransAmerican,\n811 S.W.2d at 916-17 n. 4. Neither standard allows\nimposition of excessive sanctions. Moreover, while the due\nprocess concerns under the two rules are not completely\ncongruent, case determinative sanctions may not be\nimposed under either rule unless the violation warrants\nadjudication of the merits. Even if GCSC had violated Rule\n13, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the\nviolation could not have been fully redressed far short of\nstriking GCSC's pleadings.\n\nPage 732\n\n    Thus, we hold that the district court clearly abused its\ndiscretion in imposing sanctions under Rule 13.\n\n    IV\n\n    Finally, we consider whether GCSC has an adequate\nremedy by appeal. We have previously held that appeal\nfrom the imposition of case determinative, or \"death\npenalty\", sanctions is inadequate, unless the sanctions are\nimposed simultaneously with a final, appealable judgment.\n\fPage 577                                                           Darcey testified in his deposition that Bailey had mild\n                                                                   asbestosis with no evidence of impairment.\n92 S.W.3d 577 (Tex.App. —Austin 2002)\n                                                                          The case was reset for trial in late 1999 and again in\nNORFOLK         SOUTHERN         RAILWAY         COMPANY,          October 2001.

C.R. at 8. On March 12, 2013,\n                       Appellee and Barbara McHale were appointed guardians\n\n1\n  Another sister, Barbara McHale, died during the course of this proceeding and a\nfourth sister, Betty Jane Grossman Bish, died several years before suit was filed and\nleft a son, Patrick Grossman, who is an heir under Edna Moon’s will.\n\n\n\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 1\n\f                         of the estate and person, respectively, of Edna Moon. On\n                         October 7, 2014, the trial court granted Appellee’s first\n                         motion for sanctions for discovery abuse – primarily for\n                         failing to identify bank account/real property information\n                         – awarding Appellee monetary sanctions of $15,000 plus\n                         an additional $3,000 in attorney’s fees (the “First Sanction\n                         Order”). C.R. at 544 and R.R. Vol. 8 at 54-55. The trial\n                         court also entered an Amended Docket Control Order\n                         setting out various pretrial deadline and setting the matter\n                         for jury trial on January 26, 2015.\n\n                         In compliance with the Amended Docket Control Order,\n                         on December 19, 2014 the Appellant filed her First\n                         Supplemental Answer and Counterclaim. C.R. at 558.\n                         Appellee sought additional discovery. The trial court was\n                         unable to hear the case on January 26, 2015 and it was\n                         reset for trial on March 9, 2015. C.R. at 846. The trial\n                         court set new deadlines for filing amended pleadings. Id.\n                         Appellant’s expert witness, Michael Turner, was deposed\n                         on January 13, 2015 and Appellant was deposed a second\n                         time on February 4, 2015. C.R. at 928 and 1067.\n\n                         On February 20, 2015, Appellee filed a second Motion for\n                         Sanctions based primarily on alleged inconsistencies in\n                         Appellant’s testimony and allegations Appellant was\n                         asserting “new” theories or claims. C.R. at 987. This\n                         motion for sanctions was ultimately heard by the trial court\n                         on March 2, 2015.\n\nTrial Court’s Disposition: On March 10, 2015 the trial court signed the Order\n                        Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions (the “Sanctions\n                        Order”) entering “death penalty” sanctions against\n                        Appellant including denying the Appellant the right to a\n                        jury trial on the damages issue. C.R. at 1621. The trial\n                        court made it clear the sanctions were entered as a result\n                        of false testimony and not based on Appellee’s allegations\n\n\n                             Appellant’s Brief – Page 2\n\f                      of Appellant asserting a new theory.

Beginning as early as March of 2000, Howard and Edna Moon gifted\n\nreal property to Appellant. By way of a gift deed dated March 3, 2000, Howard and\n\nEdna Moon deeded a lot in the Hunter’s Glen subdivision in Hays County to\n\nAppellant (the “Hunter’s Glen” property). C.R. at 1400. Similarly, by way of a Gift\n\nDeeds dated May 4, 2006, Howard and Edna Moon deeded a property on Ranch\n\nRoad 12 in Hays County to Appellant (the “RR 12” property) and property in\n\nGuadalupe County, Texas (the “Rest Haven” property or “Lake McQueeney”\n\nproperty). Id. at 1434 and 1439 and RR Vol. 15 at 805-12. The RR 12 and Rest\n\nHaven deeds are together referred to herein as the “Gift Deeds.”2 Edna Moon\n\nactively participated in the acquisition of Rest Haven property executing purchase\n\nrelated documents. Id. at 1409-32. Beginning no later than April 12 of 2000,\n\nHoward Moon, Edna Moon, and Appellant also entered into multi-party bank\n\naccounts with rights of survivorship and allocating ownership of the account in\n\nproportion to net contributions to the account. Id. at 1407; see also id. at 1406\n\n(similar account for Appellant and Edna Moon).\n\n\n\n\n2\n The “RR 12” property description is recorded in Vol. 2916, Page 759 of the Official\nPublic Records of Hays County, Texas and the “Rest Haven” property is described\nas Lot 140 and part of 139, Treasure Island Unit 1 in Guadalupe County, Texas.\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 5\n\f      2.     After Howard Moon died, Edna Moon revised her will leaving her\n\nestate to her then living daughters (Appellant, Appellee, and Barbara McHale) and\n\nto the son of her deceased daughter, Patrick Grossman, and acknowledging the debt\n\nowed to her by Appellee. C.R. at 1444 (dated February 27, 2007). Appellant\n\ncontinued to assisted her mother in the acquisition and disposition of other real\n\nproperty interests and which have been described in this litigation as the “La Playa”\n\nproperty and the “Park Place” property. Id. at 1460 and 1475.\n\n      3.     By September 2008, the Appellee (and Barbara McHale) were making\n\ncomplaints about the alleged misuse of Edna Moon’s estate to Mr. H.C. Kyle who\n\nwas the attorney for Howard and Edna Moon. Id. at 1467. A complaint was made\n\nto Adult Protective Services in the summer of 2009. APS investigated and spoke to,\n\namong others, Edna Moon, Mr. Kyle, and Edna Moon’s caregivers and ruled out\n\nclaims of exploitation of Edna Moon by Appellant as “invalid.” Id. at 1488 and R.R.\n\nVol. 15 at 128. Edna Moon then revised her will which included admonishments\n\nagainst similar complaints against Appellant by Appellee and Barbara McHale. C.R.\n\nat 1501 (will dated August 12, 2009). Appellee was notified of the change in the\n\nwill and the reasons for it by Mr. Kyle. Id. at 1514. Appellee responded to Mr. Kyle\n\nin August 2009 again complaining of Appellant. Id. at 1516.\n\n      4.     Upon Edna Moon’s return from an extended stay out of state, in\n\nOctober of 2011 Appellee and Barbara McHale took Edna Moon to another attorney\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 6\n\fto “discuss taking over our mother’s financial affairs” and had Edna Moon change\n\nher will and execute a statutory durable power of attorney naming Appellee as the\n\nagent. RR Vol. 15 at 18 and 22. The Appellee then filed this suit in February 2012\n\nalleging assorted causes of action based on alleged misuse of Edna Moon’s funds by\n\nAppellant. In March of 2012, Appellee and Barbara McHale and Edna Moon opened\n\na multi-party account with rights of survivorship and with ownership in proportion\n\nto net contributions similar to the accounts Edna Moon (and Howard Moon) opened\n\nwith Appellant. C.R. at 1521.\n\n        5.   During the proceeding, the Appellee complained that Appellant would\n\nnot provide appropriate information and documents. C.R. at 306, 987. Ultimately,\n\nthe trial court agreed and entered the Sanctions Order striking all of Appellant’s\n\nclaims and defenses and prohibiting a jury trial. Id. at 1621 [Appendix 1]. The trial\n\ncourt then held a bench trial solely on the issue of damages without allowing\n\nAppellant to assert any defenses. The trial court then entered the Final Judgment.\n\nId. at 1640 [Appendix 2]. The trial court also entered its findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law in support of the Sanctions Order and the Final Judgment. Id. at\n\n1678.\n\n                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n        6.   The Appellant appeals the Sanctions Order [C.R. at 1621 and\n\nAppendix 1] and Final Judgment [C.R. at 1640 and Appendix 2] arising out of the\n\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 7\n\fSanctions Order. The Appellant appeals the Sanctions Order as “unjust” because\n\nthe Sanctions Order imposed death penalty sanctions against Appellant when there\n\nwas no direct relationship between the alleged offensive conduct by the Appellant\n\nand the ultimate scope of the Sanctions Order. The Appellant also appeals the\n\nSanctions Order because the scope of the Sanctions Order was excessive and\n\nviolated Appellant’s constitutional rights in striking all of Appellant’s claims and\n\ndefenses. Further, Rules 13 and 215 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and\n\nChapter 10 of the Civil Practice & Remedies Code do not expand the analysis of\n\nwhether the Sanctions Order is “just.”\n\n      7_.    If this Court upholds the Sanctions Order, the Appellant also appeals\n\nthe Final Judgment it is based on the overly broad Sanctions Order and because it\n\nimproperly purports to award the Appellee a double or even triple recovery in\n\nviolation of the one satisfaction rule. There was no allocation requested or made by\n\nthe trial court among multiple causes of action asserted by Appellee and the award\n\nof Appellee’s actual/economic damages. However, with respect to some properties\n\nat issue, the Final Judgment awarded Appellee not only the value of the property,\n\nbut also the property itself and, in one case the additional remedy of a constructive\n\ntrust against Appellant’s homestead for more than $300,000, resulting in a double or\n\neven triple recovery by Appellee. Further, the damages calculations used for the\n\nconstructive trust in the Final Judgment also improperly fail to acknowledge the rule\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 8\n\fwhereby the first funds taken from a co-mingled accounts are presumed to belong to\n\nthe person holding the trust funds.\n\n      8.     There is insufficient evidence to support setting aside the “Gift Deeds”\n\nfrom Howard and Edna Moon to Appellant, and by doing so, the Final Judgment\n\nimproperly clouds the title of third-parties who were not before the trial court. The\n\nFinal Judgment and damages awarded do not take into consideration the contractual\n\nagreement and specific allocation of ownership of funds in, at least some, of the joint\n\naccounts at issue. The punitive damages award in the Final Judgment is also\n\nexcessive in light of the facts and the impact of the Sanctions Order.\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      9.     A trial court’s ruling on a motion for sanctions is reviewed under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. See e.g., American Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354605\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354605/american-flood-research-inc-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583 (Tex. 2006). The trial court entered findings of fact in support of\n\nthe Sanctions Order and Final Judgment. C.R. at 1678. However, in reviewing\n\nsanctions orders, the appellate courts are not bound by a trial court's findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law and must independently review the entire record to determine\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion. Id. This Court should review the\n\nappealed portions of the trial court’s judgment under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\nThe findings of fact by the trial court should be reviewed on a factual sufficiency\n\nbasis – is there sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding.\n\n\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 9\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n      10.    Appellant, Susan England (Lee) requests that the Court reverse, reform\n\nand/or render the trial court’s Sanction Order and Final Judgment based on the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                            THE SANCTIONS ORDER\n\n      11.    On March 10, 2015 the trial court entered the Order Granting Plaintiff’s\n\nMotion for Sanctions (the “Sanctions Order”). C.R. at 1621 [Appendix 1]. The\n\nSanctions Order was entered pursuant to Rules 13 and 215 Tex. R. Civ. P., Chapter\n\n10 of the Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code, and the Court’s inherent power to sanction.\n\nId. The Court made findings in connection with the Sanctions Order and entered\n\n“death penalty” type sanctions including, striking Appellant’s pleadings, granting a\n\ndefault judgment on issues of liability to Appellee and on all claims and defenses –\n\nwith all facts determined in favor of Appellee, and denying Appellant’s right to a\n\njury trial. Id. at 1628 [Appendix 1, page 8].\n\n      12.    While the imposition of sanctions is left to the sound discretion of the\n\ntrial court, any sanctions imposed must be \"just.” TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp.\n\nv., Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1682240\"><a href=\"/opinion/1682240/transamerican-natural-gas-corp-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 917 (Tex. 1991). There are two general standards for\n\nmeasuring whether the sanction is “just” -- there must be a direct relationship\n\nbetween the offensive conduct and the sanction imposed and the sanction must not\n\nbe excessive. Am. Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354605\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354605/american-flood-research-inc-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583 (Tex. 2006).\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 10\n\fThe imposition of very severe sanctions, like the “death penalty” sanctions entered\n\nin this case, is limited, not only by these two overriding standards, but by\n\nconstitutional due process. Id. In this case, the trial court erred in entering the death\n\npenalty sanctions against Appellant because: a) there was no direct relationship\n\nbetween the offensive conduct alleged and the scope of the Sanctions Order, b) the\n\nscope of the Sanctions Order was excessive, and c) the scope of the Sanctions Order\n\nimproperly invaded Appellant’s constitutional rights.\n\nA.    The Trial Court Erred in Entering Death Penalty Sanctions Against\n      Appellant Because There is Not a Direct Relationship Between the\n      Offensive Conduct and the Sanction Imposed.\n\n      13.    In order to meet her burden of proof in justifying the death penalty\n\nsanctions in this case, the Appellee must show that the conduct of the Appellant is\n\ndirectly related to the scope of the sanction imposed. In this case, the Appellee\n\ncomplains primarily of the Appellant’s failure to provide financial information and\n\nher alleged changes in testimony/position. However, the Appellee did not offer any\n\nevidence, and there was no finding by the Court, that anything the Appellant did\n\neffectively prevented the Appellee’s from preparing for trial. On the contrary, the\n\nAppellant, through her expert witness, accountant Mike Turner, accounted for all\n\nexpenditures of Edna Moon’s money from 2007 forward until Appellee took over\n\nEdna Moon’s estate. Mr. Turner testified at the sanctions hearing:\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 11\n\fQ. (BY MR. JUNKIN) Mr. Turner, were you hired as an\nexpert witness in this case?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Approximately when?\nA. January or February of 2014.\nQ. And did you prepare an initial report in this case on\nor about September the 11th of 2014?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And is your report primarily responsive to the report\nprepared by expert witnesses for the Plaintiff?\nA. Yes, that part was primarily responsive.\nQ. And that report, as you understand it, was provided\nto opposing counsel?\nA. I believe so by Mr. Morris and Mr. Wise.\nQ. And did you prepare a supplemental report on or about\nDecember 26th of 2014?\nA. Yes, I did.\nQ. What was the purpose of that supplemental report?\nA. It was to go into more depth about the actual use of\nthe funds. Not just the transfer of the funds but the use.\nQ. Was that supplemental report a change of your\noriginal opinion?\nA. No, it was just expounding on the information that\nhad not been provided.\n...\nQ. (BY MR. JUNKIN) Did your supplemental report\nbasically expand on your original report?\nA. To be as clear as possible, the original report was\nnot comprehensive from Sol Schwartz, so I took and corrected\nand, in fact, added amounts to their report that had been\ntransferred to Mrs. Moon and then continued forward with the\nuse and the proceeds of those funds, which I guess could --\ncould technically be considered supplementing where it went to\na conclusion.\nQ. Were you able, in connection with the supplemental\nreport, to be able to account for the estate of Edna Moon from\nback as far as 2007?\nA. Yes. I was able to track all of the money that had\ncome out of the joint account and -- or joint accounts and\n\n                Appellant’s Brief – Page 12\n\f             where they went into the four categories that I created for\n             the use of funds and then to ultimately where they were spent.\n             Q. Are you aware of the implication that that report had\n             been prepared and was ready as of the date the case was\n             mediated?\n             A. Yes, I was.\n             Q. Are you aware of and participated some in that\n             mediation; is that correct?\n             A. Yes, I was there.\n             Q. And is it true that the report was prepared in\n             advance of the mediation?\n             A. No, not at all. I had to work eight-and-a-half hours\n             Christmas Eve, which was the 24th; I worked about nine hours\n             on Christmas Day; and then another seven hours to finally\n             finish it on Friday.\n             Q. And subsequent to the preparation of that\n             supplemental report were you deposed?\n             A. Yes.\n             Q. And are you aware of any limitations on opposing\n             counsels' ability to ask you questions?\n             A. I don't think there was any limitation, no.\n             Q. And did you explain to them the nature and purpose of\n             that supplemental report during that deposition?\n             A. Yes, I did.\n\nRR, Vol. 12, Page 35, line 8 trough Page 36, Line 6; Page 37, Line 11 through Page\n\n38, Line 23. Mr. Turner further testified:\n\n             Q. And I think you may have testified to this at the\n             hearing last week, but have you been able to account for --\n             going back as far as 2007, have you been able to account for\n             all of Edna Moon's financial assets as a result of a careful\n             review of the documentation?\n             A. Yes. I've been able to ascertain the dollar amounts,\n             yes.\n\n\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 13\n\fRR Vol. 14, Page 123, lines 10 – 16.3 In other words, it was Appellant’s expert, Mr.\n\nTurner, who accounted for all of Edna Moon’s estate from approximately 2007\n\nforward and expanded on the scope of the estate described by Appellee’s expert\n\nwitness (Sol Schwartz). There was no evidence presented that any record or records\n\nthat might identify the scope of Mrs. Moon’s estate was/were not provided.\n\n      14.   The significance of this is that Appellee never argued or suggested that\n\nshe was not able to properly prepare for trial when all of Edna Moon’s estate had\n\nbeen accounted for as early as September, 2014.4 There was also no evidence of\n\nadditional information on the scope of Edna Moon’s estate that Appellee could\n\nproduce. As the Texas Supreme Court found:\n\n      We do not doubt that a failure to produce documents can prejudice a party's\n      efforts to assert or defend a claim. But here, there has simply been no showing\n      that the Garcias are unable to prepare for trial without the additional crash-\n      test reports they seek. Furthermore, the record fails to demonstrate Chrysler's\n      ability to produce the missing crash-test reports. There is no evidence in the\n      record that the missing tests exist or are within Chrysler's possession, custody,\n\n\n3\n  See also, R.R.

There also was an Adult Protective Services investigation in July-\n\nAugust of 2009 that contains evidence rebutting any presumption that may have been\n\nraised by the conduct of Appellant. See C.R. 1485 and R.R. Vol. 15 at 125 (the\n\n“APS Report”). In the APS Report, it is alleged that Appellant was “misusing” Edna\n\nMoon’s funds. Id. at 1489. However, the APS investigator interviewed attorney\n\nH.C. Kyle in August 2009 and noted:\n\n      Mr. Kyle explained he has been Howard Moon (deceased) and Edna Moon’s\n      attorney for years. Mr. Kyle is familiar with Deed of Gift of Lake McQueeney\n\n8\n  It is interesting to note that the Frost Bank accounts ending in 8381 and 4607\nnaming Edna Moon and/or Appellee or Barbara McHale and Kolbe were created as\nthe same kind of account with rights of survivorship.

Mr. Kyle reports that Barbara and Janice have\n      complained to him about Ms. England’s mis-management of the client’s\n      money. Mr. Kyle reports Ms. Moon has not complained about Susan\n      England’s management of her resources or reported financial abuse.\n\nId. at 1495. There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that Edna Moon9 was not\n\naware of what she was doing with respect to signing deeds, prepared by her lawyer,\n\nand in gifting the RR 12 and Rest Haven properties to Appellant. C.R. 1434-42.\n\n      20.   Further, the investigator reported that: “Client [Edna Moon] states that\n\nCw should stop harassing Susan England. Client states Susan has always managed\n\nthe client’s financial affairs fairly and legally.” Id. at 1497. The allegation of\n\nexploitation of Mrs. Moon by Appellant was found to be “invalid.” Shortly,\n\nthereafter, Mrs. Moon amended her will, again naming Susan England as Executor,\n\nand adding a provision:\n\n      In the event my situation is ever again investigated by Texas Adult Protective\n      Services or similar governmental agency, or in the event charges are ever filed\n      against my daughter, SUSAN K.

At the request of Edna Moon, Mr. Kyle also notified Appellee of the change\n\nin the will. C.R. at 1514.\n\n      21.    There is additional evidence that Edna Moon was aware of what was\n\nhappening with respect to purchases of real property. For example, Mrs. Moon\n\nsigned closing documents for the purchase of the Rest Haven property. See e.g., CR\n\n1418, 1419, and 1421. Even Tom Huth testified that:\n\n             Q. When we took your deposition, you mentioned\n             that you thought that Susan was a nice person but that\n             she had done some things wrong, that she needed to\n             correct that. Could you elaborate on what you think it\n             is that she has done wrong.\n             A. I -- I feel that she's just taken advantage of\n             her mother and all her money on there. I think that she\n             just needs to, you know, fess up and say, \"Okay. Let's\n             settle this all out. Let's give all this money back.\n             It's all supposed to be split up four ways.\" And that\n             was Morn's -- and her dad's plan. And that's the way --\n             that's the way it should be.\n             And I think that she's used up a -- these\n             assets of her morn and her dad, and she used them for her\n             own personal use or for buying her houses and stuff, or\n             used them under the guise that Mom is really, you know,\n             the owner of these things. And without Mom's money or\n             -- and her dad's money, none of this would have -- could\n             have occurred. So -- and she needs to -- you know, I\n             said, \"Mom intended\" -- whenever Mom gave her any of\n             this money, she -- Mom -- in fact, Edna always had told\n             me this too, she said, \"All this money that's going into\n             all this stuff that I've invested in with Susan is\n             basically for the\" -- and it wasn't so much an\n             investment with -- with Susan, it was an investment for\n\n\n                             Appellant’s Brief – Page 20\n\f            Edna, and it was supposed to be split up four ways to\n            all the heirs after Mom's death, if she didn't spend it\n            first.\n\nCR 1542 at 1544-45.\n\n      22.   There is no evidence or insufficient evidence that conduct complained\n\nof by the Appellee justified a presumption that Appellant’s claims or defenses\n\nrelating to Mrs. Moon’s knowledge of the uses of funds in issue lack merit. At a\n\nminimum, if such a presumption could arise, there is ample evidence outside of\n\nAppellant’s testimony to rebut any such presumption.\n\n      23.   The Appellant acknowledges that the trial court was not required to\n\nactually impose lesser sanctions10 and that the Sanctions Order includes findings\n\nindicating that the trial court did consider lesser sanctions and imposed a lesser\n\nsanction in the First Sanction Order. However, there is no or insufficient evidence\n\nthat the sanction entered in the First Sanction Order was not effective.

Under this standard, the trial court need not\n      test the effectiveness of each available lesser sanction by actually imposing\n      the lesser sanction on the party before issuing the death penalty; rather, the\n      trial court must analyze the available sanctions and offer a reasoned\n      explanation as to the appropriateness of the sanction imposed.\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 21\n\faccounts in issue by Mr. Turner after the First Sanctions Order. While the Sanctions\n\nOrder does make specific findings/references to prior “admonitions” from the trial\n\ncourt to Appellant and attaches some significance to them in connection with\n\nattempts at lesser sanctions,11 admonitions are not sanctions.

The entry of death penalty sanctions also implicates the sanctioned\n\nparty’s constitutional due process rights. As the Texas Supreme Court discussed in\n\nTransAmerican: “When a trial court strikes a party's pleadings and dismisses its\n\naction or renders a default judgment against it for abuse of the discovery process,\n\nthe court adjudicates the party's claims without regard to their merits but based\n\n\n11\n  See e.g., C.R. at 1621 (paragraph 2) and 1627 (paragraph 48); see also RR Vol.\n12, page 116, lines 21-23.\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 22\n\finstead upon the parties' conduct of discovery.” TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp.\n\nv.

Because of that, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt noted:\n\n      [T]here are constitutional limitations upon the power of courts, even in aid of\n      their own valid processes, to dismiss an action without affording a party the\n      opportunity for a hearing on the merits of his cause.\n\nId.

Because of the underlying due process issues, “[d]iscovery\n\nsanctions cannot be used to adjudicate the merits of a party's claims or defenses\n\nunless a party's hindrance of the discovery process justifies a presumption that its\n\nclaims or defenses lack merit.” Id. However, if a party refuses to produce material\n\nevidence, despite the imposition of lesser sanctions, the court may presume that an\n\nasserted claim or defense lacks merit and dispose of it. Id.\n\n      25.      As discussed above, Appellee did present evidence sufficient to allow\n\nfor an accounting of all the accounts in issue from 2007 until the Appellee took over\n\nEdna Moon’s accounts. While punishment and deterrence are legitimate purposes\n\nfor sanctions, they do not justify trial by sanctions. TransAmerican, 811 S.W.2d at\n\n918. Sanctions which are so severe as to preclude presentation of the merits of the\n\ncase should not be assessed absent a party's flagrant bad faith or counsel's callous\n\ndisregard for the responsibilities of discovery under the rules. Id. As further\n\ndiscussed above, there is ample evidence supporting claims and defenses of the\n\nAppellant and such claims are not meritless.\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 23\n\f         26.   The Appellee did not establish that any evidence with respect to the\n\naccounts was withheld by Appellant sufficient to justify a presumption that all of her\n\nclaims and defenses lacked merit. The Appellee did not produce any evidence of\n\ninformation about the accounts that was withheld after the trial court’s First\n\nSanctions Order. There is insufficient evidence that the alleged misconduct of the\n\nAppellant justifies a presumption that all of her claims and defenses are without\n\nmerit and death penalty sanctions should not have been used to deny the Appellant\n\na trial on the merits.\n\n         27.   There are references in the Sanctions Order to selling property and\n\nusing money to pay fees and for Appellant’s own purposes. See e.g., CR 1624 and\n\n1626, paragraphs 20, 21, 22, 23, and 36). There are also references to Appellant\n\nproviding false deposition testimony. Id. at 1623, paragraph 12. However, there is\n\nno legal basis – no order, statute, rule, etc. – to authorize the trial court’s imposition\n\nof sanctions for this conduct and it should not have been taken into consideration in\n\nconnection with entering the Sanctions Order.12 It was a violation of Appellant’s\n\ndue process rights for the trial court to have relied on this conduct as a basis for the\n\nSanctions Order.\n\n\n\n\n12\n     See e.g., paragraph 23 above.\n                                Appellant’s Brief – Page 24\n\f      28.

As to the affidavit made in connection with lifting the Lis Pendens,\n\nAppellant testified that Edna Moon “has never had any ownership interest” in the La\n\nPlaya property or the Hilliard Road property. CR at 58. The Sanctions Order makes\n\na finding that Appellant lied in making that statement. CR at 1623 (paragraph 11).\n\nBoth of these properties were, at one time, held in the name of Appellant. See CR\n\n1457 and 1462. There is no evidence that either of these properties was ever deeded\n\nto, or otherwise titled in the name of, Edna Moon. Additionally, part of Appellee’s\n\nargument for sanctions was that Appellant “changed” her story to allege a “silent\n\npartnership.” While Appellant denies there was a partnership relating to these two\n\n(2) properties, if there was, Appellant would be correct that Appellee (and Appellant)\n\nhad no ownership interest in these properties. See TEX. BUS. ORG. CODE §152.101\n\n(“Partnership property is not the property of the partners.”). While Appellant’s\n\nintent behind the statement may differ from its technical legal veracity, it is clear\n\nthat the trial court did not rely on that statement in expunging the Lis Pendens. See\n\nCR at 67 (the court struck out two findings relating to Appellee’s claim to the real\n\nproperty but went ahead and expunged the lis pendens because Appellee did not\n\nprovide proper service of the required notice). The intent behind Rule 13 does not\n\njustify the imposition of death penalty sanctions for the statement in the affidavit,\n\nparticularly when it was disregarded by the trial court in expunging the lis pendens.\n\n\n\n\n                              Appellant’s Brief – Page 30\n\fF.

For all the reasons set out hereinabove, the trial court erred in striking\n\nall of Appellant’s claims and defenses because: a) there was no direct relationship\n\nbetween the allegedly offensive conduct by Appellant and the scope of the Sanctions\n\nOrder, b) the scope of the Sanctions Order was excessive, and c) the scope of the\n\nSanctions Order improperly invaded Appellant’s constitutional rights.

The trial court entered judgment based on calculations and accounting\n\ninformation primarily presented by Appellant’s expert witness, Michael Turner,\n\nCPA. See C.R. 1699 (the trial court’s actual damages calculations) and R.R., Vol.\n\n15 at 312-17 (portions of Mr. Turner’s revised supplemental report [2/5/15]). Those\n\nactual economic damage calculations do not segregate or allocate economic damages\n\namong any of the different causes of action asserted by Appellee and preclude\n\nAppellee from now allocating damages among her causes of action. Because of that,\n\nthose damages calculations also reflect violations of the one satisfaction rule and an\n\nimproper double/triple recovery for Appellee.\n\n                         La Playa and Park Place Properties\n\n      42.    The first entry on the trial court’s damages calculations (C.R. at 1699)\n\nreflects an amount of $683,394 (less $5,410) as “Funds from Edna spent by\n\nEngland.” C.R. at 1699. That amount includes the funds for the purchase of the “La\n\nPlaya” (“LP”) and “Park Place” (“PP”) properties. See R.R., Vol. 15 at 313 and 315.\n\nHowever, the next entry on the judgment calculation sheet includes additional actual\n\ndamages of sale proceeds from the sale of those two properties – described as the\n\n“Cash Out at Sale” on Mr. Tuner’s report. Id. at 315. Both of these properties sold\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 33\n\fat a net loss. So, the Final Judgment awarded the Appellee not only the money used\n\nto purchase the properties, but also the proceeds from the sale of the properties which\n\nnecessarily would have included the funds to purchase the properties – especially\n\nwhen the properties sold at a loss. There was no evidence or insufficient evidence\n\nof the market value of the properties at the time they were sold and no evidence that\n\nmore than market value was paid at the time of the purchase of those properties.\n\nAwarding the Appellee all of the fund used to purchase the property and the sale\n\nproceeds, when the properties sold at a loss, is not a proper measure of damages and\n\namounts to an improper double recovery.\n\n               RR 12 and Rest Haven (Lake McQueeney) Properties\n\n      43.    The Final Judgment also includes an award of actual damages of\n\n$338,631 for the sale proceeds from the RR 12 property and $96,524 for the sale\n\nproceed from the Rest Haven property. C.R. 1699. However, the Final Judgement\n\nwent on to award Appellee the properties themselves by declaring the Gift Deeds\n\n“set aside . . . void and without effect.” C.R. 1641. There was no showing by the\n\nAppellee that the sales price for the properties was under or less than market value.\n\nThe Final Judgment awards the Appellee not only the market value of the properties,\n\nbut also the properties themselves. Accordingly, in awarding both the sales price\n\nand voiding the Gift Deeds, the Final Judgment improperly grants the Plaintiff a\n\ndouble recovery and violates the one satisfaction rule.\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 34\n\f         44.   Despite the plain language of the Gift Deeds and the statute of frauds\n\nand parol evidence rule that would tend to prohibit testimony that the deeds of these\n\nproperties were not “gifts” to Appellant, the Appellee pled that Appellant\n\nrepresented that she would “hold title in a nominee/agency capacity for the benefit\n\nof . . . [Edna Moon’s] other daughters and grandson Patrick.” C.R. 1588 (page 8 of\n\nPlaintiff’s Fifth Amended Original Petition). However, to the extent that the\n\nAppellant was holding these assets in trust for beneficiaries (including herself) there\n\nwas no evidence of any limits placed on Appellant’s management of such trust assets\n\nor that she not would have all rights and powers granted to a trustee under the Texas\n\nProperty Code (Texas Trust Code).15 If there was no trust relationship created, but\n\nthe transfer was not intended as a gift, the Appellee, in her representative capacity,\n\nlacks standing to bring an action for recovery of property held for the purported\n\nbenefit of other persons.\n\nH.

The\n\nFinal Judgment does not allocate actual damages for any particular cause of action\n\nand there was no election of remedies. Appellee is not entitled to a combined\n\nrecovery of actual economic damages under each of her alleged claims\n\n      46.   For example, in Willis v. Donnelly, the 14th Court of Appeals was faced\n\nwith the impact of a constructive trust remedy when actual damages were awarded.\n\nThe Willis court found:\n\n             Lastly, appellants argue that the constructive trust triples Donnelly's\n      recovery. Donnelly concedes that the constructive trust duplicates the money\n      judgment and seeks remand for an election of remedies. \"A party who seeks\n      redress under two or more theories of recovery for a single wrong must elect,\n      before the judgment is rendered, under which remedy he wishes the court to\n      enter judgment.\" If the prevailing party fails to elect a remedy, the trial court\n      should render a judgment affording the greater recovery. If the trial court fails\n      to do so, generally, we will reform the judgment to effect such an election.\n      See id.\n\n            However, appellate courts sometimes remand a case for an election of\n      remedies. We remand the constructive trust in this case for two reasons. First,\n      the portion of the constructive trust imposed upon 50% of URB stock and 10%\n      of WHE stock duplicates recovery for breach of contract, which we have\n      reversed and remanded.

The evidence from Appellee suggests that $100,452.53 was deposited\n\ninto account 8533 from the sale of the La Playa property and then, the next day,\n\n$100,000 was transferred into the 8739 account. R.R. 15 at 748-49. The balance of\n\nthe 8533 account just before the transfer was $103,994.76 of which $100,452.53 was\n\nfrom the sale of the La Playa property and the balance, $3,542.23, were Appellant’s\n\nfunds. Because of the foregoing rule, the first $3,542.23 transferred to the 8739\n\naccount was Appellant’s and only the balance of $96,457.77 in the $100,000 transfer\n\ncould be attributable to the La Playa sale. As to the 8739 account, there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that a “[c]onstructive trust\n\nof $100,000 results [sic] at this time. July 2013.” C.R. at 1685.\n\n      50.    Several months later, $188,244.59 was transferred into the 8533\n\naccount from the sale of Appellant’s former homestead at 331 Hunter’s Glen in San\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 38\n\fMarcos, Texas – the Hunter’s Glen property – and the next day, $188,000 was\n\ntransferred to the 8739 account.        Id. at 752-53.       The trial court’s findings\n\nacknowledge that the $188,000 was proceeds from the sale of Appellant’s property.\n\nWhen the $201,000 was transferred out of the 8739 account for the purchase of\n\nAppellant’s home at 4919 West Frances Place in Austin, the balance in the 8739\n\naccount was $278,008.89. Id. at 760 (balance on July 2 was $77,008.89 after the\n\n$201,000 withdrawal). Using the rule referred to above, of the $201,000 paid for\n\nthe West Frances Place home, $188,000 was Appellant’s and only $13,000 could be\n\nattributable to the sale of the La Playa property.\n\n      51.    Even if the court were to find that the RR 12 property was not a gift and\n\nthat a constructive trust should be applied to the proceeds from the sale of that\n\nproperty, the $206,007.09 that could be attributable to the sale of the RR 12 property\n\ntaken together with the $13,000 traceable as proceeds from the sale of the La Playa\n\nproperty – a total of $219,007.09 – does not support a constructive trust in the\n\namount of $306,007.09.\n\n     The Constructive Trust on the Mercedes Benz for $12,182.36 is Improper\n\n      52.     As discussed in paragraph 48 above, with respect to “commingled”\n\naccounts, it is presumed that the first funds drawn out were personal funds. The trial\n\ncourt found that in September 2012, a deposit of $55,752.81 was made into account\n\n8533. C.R. at 1685. From the evidence this appears to be a typographical error\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 39\n\fbecause on August 31, 2012 $50,752.81 was deposited into account 8533. RR Vol.\n\n15 at 739. The trial court found this deposit was attributable to the sale of the Park\n\nPlace property. Id. The records do reflect a transfer of $55,000 to account 8739 on\n\nSeptember 4, 2012. Id. at 740-41. However, after the transfer of the $55,000 on\n\nSeptember 4, the balance of the 8533 account was $7,567.94, meaning that under\n\nthe first out rule, the most of the $50,752.81 proceeds from the sale of the Park Place\n\nproperty that could have been transferred to the 8739 account was $43,184.8717 and\n\ntherefore remaining $11,815.13 out of the $55,000 was attributable to Appellant’s\n\nfunds. Id. at 739.\n\n         53.   The balance in the 8739 account just before the time of the $55,000\n\ndeposit was $10,421.53 [Id. at 741 (September 4, 2012 daily balance of $65,421.53\n\nless $55,000 transferred)] and after the deposit the amount in that account\n\nattributable to Appellant was $22,236.66.18 The evidence shows that between the\n\ndeposit on September 4, 2012 and the payment made to Mercedes Benz Financial\n\non September 9, 2012 in the amount of $12,182.36, the balance in the 8739 account\n\nexceeded the amount attributable to the proceeds from the sale of the Park Place\n\nproperty by more than the payment to Mercedes Benz Financial and, under the first\n\n\n\n17\n     $50,752.81 - $7,567.94.\n18\n     The sum of $11,815.13 and $10,421.53.\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 40\n\fout presumption, establishes that funds separately attributable to Appellant were\n\nused to make the payment to Mercedes Benz.\n\n      54.    There is insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that a\n\n“[c]onstructive trust of $12,182.36 [was] created” or that there was “no evidence by\n\n[Appellant] that funds other than Edna Moon’s funds were used for this payoff.”\n\nC.R. at 1685-86.      The record itself establishes that the imposition of such\n\nconstructive trust in the Final Judgment is improper under the first out rule.\n\nI.    The Final Judgment Improperly Places a Claim on Appellant’s\n      Homestead.\n\n      55.    “Constitutional homestead rights protect citizens from losing their\n\nhomes, and statutes relating to homestead rights are liberally construed to protect the\n\nhomestead.” Fairfield Financial Group, Inc. v.

As this Court has further noted in Fairfield, the Property Code\n\nlists the types of encumbrances that may be properly fixed upon homestead property,\n\nwhich includes purchase money liens. Id. § 41.001(b)(1). Based on the foregoing,\n\neven if there is evidence in this case warranting imposition of a constructive trust\n\nbased on a purchase money type lien, the scope of the purchase money used for the\n\nAppellant’s homestead has not been properly established and therefore the\n\n\n\n                               Appellant’s Brief – Page 41\n\f“constructive trust lien” imposed on Appellant’s homestead in the Final Judgment is\n\nimproper.\n\n      56.    In addition, the RR 12 property was a gift to Appellant and there is\n\ninsufficient proper evidence to set that conveyance aside and to impose a\n\nconstructive trust on the proceeds from the sale of that property.

See C.R. 1406 and 1407.\n\nThese accounts were created as multi-party accounts with right of survivorship\n\nwhereby the parties agreed they owned the accounts in proportion to their\n\ncontributions to the account, that Frost Bank could pay any sum in the account to a\n\nparty at any time, and on the death of a party, the deceased party’s ownership of the\n\naccount passes to the surviving parties. Id. The subject matter of the Appellee’s\n\nclaims was, in large part, for economic losses arising out of alleged misuse of funds\n\nin these accounts (in particular the account ending in 9898).

Accordingly, this Court\n\nshould reverse the Sanctions Order and Final Judgment for the reasons set out above.\n\nAppellant requests all such other and further relief to which she might be entitled.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n                                       _______________________\n                                       David Junkin\n                                       State Bar No. 11058020\n                                       P.O.

EFFECT OF SIGNING PLEADINGS, MOTIONS AND OTHER\nPAPERS; SANCTIONS\n\nThe signatures of attorneys or parties constitute a certificate by them that they have\nread the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their knowledge,\ninformation, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not\ngroundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and brought for the purpose of\nharassment. Attorneys or parties who shall bring a fictitious suit as an experiment to\nget an opinion of the court, or who shall file any fictitious pleading in a cause for\nsuch a purpose, or shall make statements in pleading which they know to be\ngroundless and false, for the purpose of securing a delay of the trial of the cause,\nshall be held guilty of a contempt. If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in\nviolation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, after notice\nand hearing, shall impose an appropriate sanction available under Rule 215-2b, upon\nthe person who signed it, a represented party, or both.\n\nCourts shall presume that pleadings, motions, and other papers are filed in good\nfaith. No sanctions under this rule may be imposed except for good cause, the\nparticulars of which must be stated in the sanction order. \"Groundless\" for purposes\nof this rule means no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good faith argument\nfor the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. A general denial does\nnot constitute a violation of this rule. The amount requested for damages does not\nconstitute a violation of this rule.\n\n                                     Notes and Comments\n\nComment to 1990 change: To require notice and hearing before a court determines to impose\nsanctions, to specify that any sanction imposed be appropriate, and to eliminate the 90-day “grace\"\nperiod provided in the former version of the rule.\n\fRULE 39. JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION\n\n(a) Persons to Be Joined If Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process\nshall be joined as a party in the action if\n\n      (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already\n      parties, or\n\n      (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated\n      that the disposition of the action in his absence may\n\n             (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that\n             interest or\n\n             (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk\n             of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by\n             reason of his claimed interest. If he has not been so joined, the court\n             shall order that he be made a party. If he should join as a plaintiff but\n             refuses to do so, he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an\n             involuntary plaintiff.\n\n(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder Not Feasible. If a person as\ndescribed in subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall\ndetermine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among\nthe parties before it, or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded\nas indispensable. The factors to be considered by the court include: first, to what\nextent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to him or\nthose already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the\njudgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened\nor avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be\nadequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is\ndismissed for non-joinder.\n\n(c) Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder. A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall\nstate the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as described in subdivision\n(a)(1)-(2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.\n\n(d) Exception of Class Actions. This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 42.\n\fRULE 56. SPECIAL DAMAGE\n\nWhen items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated.\n\fRULE 97. COUNTERCLAIM AND CROSS-CLAIM\n\n(a) Compulsory Counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim\nwithin the jurisdiction of the court, not the subject of a pending action, which at the\ntime of filing the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out\nof the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's\nclaim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom\nthe court cannot acquire jurisdiction; provided, however, that a judgment based upon\na settlement or compromise of a claim of one party to the transaction or occurrence\nprior to a disposition on the merits shall not operate as a bar to the continuation or\nassertion of the claims of any other party to the transaction or occurrence unless the\nlatter has consented in writing that said judgment shall operate as a bar.\n\n(b) Permissive Counterclaims. A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim\nagainst an opposing party whether or not arising out of the transaction or occurrence\nthat is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.\n\n(c) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim. A counterclaim may or may not\ndiminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief\nexceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the\nopposing party, so long as the subject matter is within the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n(d) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading. A claim which either\nmatured or was acquired by the pleader after filing his pleading may be presented as\na counterclaim by amended pleading.\n\n(e) Cross-Claim Against Co-Party. A pleading may state as a cross-claim any\nclaim by one party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence that\nis the subject matter either of the original action or of a counterclaim therein. Such\ncross-claim may include a claim that the party against whom it is asserted is or may\nbe liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against\nthe cross-claimant.\n\n(f) Additional Parties. Persons other than those made parties to the original action\nmay be made parties to a third party action, counterclaim or cross-claim in\naccordance with the provisions of Rules 38, 39 and 40.\n\n(g) Tort shall not be the subject of set-off or counterclaim against a contractual\ndemand nor a contractual demand against tort unless it arises out of or is incident to\nor is connected with same.\n\f(h) Separate Trials; Separate Judgments. If the court orders separate trials as\nprovided in Rule 174, judgment on a counterclaim or cross-claim may be rendered\nwhen the court has jurisdiction so to do, even if the claims of the opposing party\nhave been dismissed or otherwise disposed of.\n\f215.1 Motion for Sanctions or Order Compelling Discovery.\n\nA party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all other persons affected\nthereby, may apply for sanctions or an order compelling discovery as follows:\n\n(a) Appropriate court.

If the court denies the motion in whole or in part, it may\n             make such protective order as it would have been empowered to make\n             on a motion pursuant to Rule 192.6.\n\n(c) Evasive or incomplete answer.

Such an order shall be subject to review on appeal from\n      the final judgment.\n\n(c) Sanction against nonparty for violation of Rules 196.7 or 205.3. If a nonparty\nfails to comply with an order under Rules 196.7 or 205.3, the court which made the\norder may treat the failure to obey as contempt of court.\n\n215.3 Abuse of Discovery Process in Seeking, Making, or Resisting Discovery.\n\nIf the court finds a party is abusing the discovery process in seeking, making or\nresisting discovery or if the court finds that any interrogatory or request for\ninspection or production is unreasonably frivolous, oppressive, or harassing, or that\na response or answer is unreasonably frivolous or made for purposes of delay, then\nthe court in which the action is pending may, after notice and hearing, impose any\nappropriate sanction authorized by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8) of Rule\n215.2(b). Such order of sanction shall be subject to review on appeal from the final\njudgment.\n\n215.4 Failure to Comply with Rule 198\n\n(a) Motion. A party who has requested an admission under Rule 198 may move to\ndetermine the sufficiency of the answer or objection. For purposes of this\nsubdivision an evasive or incomplete answer may be treated as a failure to answer.\nUnless the court determines that an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer\nbe served. If the court determines that an answer does not comply with the\n\frequirements of Rule 198, it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an\namended answer be served. The provisions of Rule 215.1(d) apply to the award of\nexpenses incurred in relation to the motion.\n\n(b) Expenses on failure to admit. If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any\ndocument or the truth of any matter as requested under Rule 198 and if the party\nrequesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the\ntruth of the matter, he may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party\nto pay him the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including\nreasonable attorney fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (1) the\nrequest was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 193, or (2) the admission sought\nwas of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing to admit had a reasonable\nground to believe that he might prevail on the matter, or (4) there was other good\nreason for the failure to admit.\n\n215.5 Failure of Party or Witness to Attend to or Serve Subpoena; Expenses.\n\n(a) Failure of party giving notice to attend. If the party giving the notice of the\ntaking of an oral deposition fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party\nattends in person or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the party\ngiving the notice to pay such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him\nand his attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n(b) Failure of witness to attend. If a party gives notice of the taking of an oral\ndeposition of a witness and the witness does not attend because of the fault of the\nparty giving the notice, if another party attends in person or by attorney because he\nexpects the deposition of that witness to be taken, the court may order the party\ngiving the notice to pay such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him\nand his attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney fees.\n\n215.6 Exhibits to Motions and Responses.\n\nMotions or responses made under this rule may have exhibits attached including\naffidavits, discovery pleadings, or any other documents.\n\fNON-MONETARY RELIEF, EQUITABLE RELIEF\n\n\n\n\n    WILLIAM W.

It's well-founded because the Plaintiffs' case has not\nerected on Defendants' property on the grounds that the          stated a cause of action under Texas law.

The petition alleged: “Defendants\nhad not consulted with Plaintiffs nor had they asked for\npermission to erect such construction knowing fully well\nthat the play set had been erected in violation of the\nresidential deed and to intentionally harass and disrupt\nPlaintiffs' life.” The Brozyinskis did not allege that the\nKerneys had a duty to secure their permission to erect the\nplay set; they alleged (as explained in detail in Kathy's\naffidavit) that the Kerneys had not received permission to\nbreach the subdivision's deed restrictions by building such a\nlarge wooden structure. At the hearing, Appellants argued\nthat this allegation was that the Kerneys were required to\nobtain the permission of the subdivision's architectural\nguidelines committee. Finally, as part of the trespass claim,\nthe petition alleged that the play set's hooks had been\nattached to the Brozynskis' fence and thus was an invasion\n(i.e., without permission) of the Brozynskis' property, and\nKathy's affidavit described that damage that the play set's\nhooks had caused to the Brozynskis' fence.\n\n[2] We note that Rule 13 uses the obligatory term “must”\nfor the trial court's duty to state the good cause particulars\nin the sanction order.

We have carefully reviewed the evidence\non these items and we think that it is sufficient to support\nthe implied finding of the trial court that the damages were\ncaused by the negligence of the Gas Company and\nsufficient to support the amount awarded. We feel that it\nwould unduly extend this opinion to review the evidence as\nto damages and we do not believe it would serve any useful\npurpose to do so. The damages to the land and to the fences\nand to the water tank are clear and it was a question of fact\nfor the trial court to determine whether or not such damages\nwere due to the negligence of the defendant, as well as to\nfind the amount.\n\n       It follows from what we have said that we are of the\nopinion that the trial court erred in issuing the injunction\nand that this injunction must be dissolved. It further\nappearing to us that the cause has been fully developed,\nthere is no occasion to reverse and remand the cause and the\njudgment with respect to the injunction must be reversed\nand rendered. It further appears to us that the judgment\nawarding damages to plaintiffs in the sum of $500 must be\nsustained and the judgment of the trial court in this respect\nis affirmed.\n\n      Accordingly, the judgment as to the injunction granted\nis reversed and rendered and the judgment of the trial court\nawarding damages to the plaintiffs is in all things affirmed.\n\n      We are further of the opinion that it would be\nequitable for the costs incurred in the trial court to be\nadjudged against the defendant and the costs incurred on\nthis appeal to be adjudged equally against appellant and\nappellees, and it is so ordered.

He said that he\nhad used this methodology before and had observed other\nappraisers use it. The State also offered evidence that\nTarget's own appraisal expert had utilized the same\nmethodology in other appraisals.

The appellate rules require us\nto reverse the court's judgment and render the judgment the\ntrial court should have rendered, unless we must remand for\nfurther proceedings or must remand in the interests of\njustice. See TEX.R.APP. P. 43.3. Because the fifth point of\nerror presents an issue that requires us to reverse and\nrender, we address it, as well.\n\n[3] Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215 governs sanctions for\ndiscovery abuse.\n\n[4] However, in a patently meritless suit, some courts have\nheld that failing to nonsuit may constitute some evidence\nsupporting sanctions. See Delgado, 936 S.W.2d at 487.\n\n[5] Spiegel/FCNB argue that the Official Staff Commentary\nto the regulations permits a card issuer to request\ninformation in written form from a cardholder. See 12\nC.F.R. § 226.12(b)-2,3 (1995). To begin with, we do not\nfind any language in the Commentary remotely resembling\nSpeigel/FCNB's contention, much less requiring a\ncardholder to return a form sent to it by the card issuer. But,\nbeyond this fundamental problem with the argument, the\nissue here is not whether the card issuer could obtain\nwritten information from Mattly. The issue is whether\nMattly, someone who had been the victim of credit card\nabuse on numerous occasions, acted in bad faith when she\nrefused to return a form (which requested confidential\ninformation) to a company her investigator could not locate\nthrough normal investigative channels. Citing to the same\ncommentary, Spiegel/FCNB also argue that if the\ncardholder fails to comply with these requests from a card\nissuer, the card issuer can terminate its investigation and\n\"seek payment from the cardholder.\" Our reading of the\nCommentary does not reveal any explicit support for this\nstatement.\n\n[6] Spiegel and FCNB did not raise preemption.\n\n[7] Mattly took no action to cause Spiegel and FCNB's legal\nfees to reach nearly $70,000, unlike some frivolous actions\nin which a party will file numerous motions and discovery\nrequests that inflate the fees.\n\n---------\n\fPage 694                                                  Appellant R.M.

Nevertheless, we\nnote that Jesus Jr. did not need to object or obtain a ruling\non any conclusory statements contained in Mary's affidavit\nbecause conclusory statements are insufficient to raise a\nfact issue.

More        would be recoverable.\nsignificantly, proof that a party relied to its detriment on an\nalleged misrepresentation is an essential element of a fraud            Moreover, nothing in Formosa Plastics prevents the\nclaim. [12] Without a binding agreement, there is no              Statute of Frauds from precluding a fraud claim that seeks\ndetrimental reliance, and thus no fraudulent inducement           to recover the benefit of an unenforceable bargain. The\n\fStatute simply was not an issue in that case--neither party     reliance. Consequently, under the circumstances presented\nargued that the Statute of Frauds had anything to do with       here, Glazner's fraud claim may survive Haase's motion for\nenforcing the parties' contract.

She alleged fraud and sought   underlying Haase's alleged common-law and statutory\nspecific performance or damages from his failure to             fraud. Glazner never did. Haase asserts that Glazner's\nperform. The jury found for the plaintiff, and the court of     failure to replead is grounds for upholding the summary\nappeals affirmed.

The Court in Maresca stated:\n\f     The assumption is implicit in the opinions of this court\nthat a trial judge will discriminate in ordering discovery\nbetween information disclosed by income tax returns which\nis relevant and material to the matters in controversy and\ninformation which is not. The protection of privacy is of\nfundamental--indeed,        of     constitutional--importance.\nSubjecting federal income tax returns of our citizens to\ndiscovery is sustainable only because the pursuit of justice\nbetween litigants outweighs protection of their privacy. But\nsacrifice of the latter should be kept to the minimum, and\nthis requires scrupulous limitation of discovery to\ninformation furthering justice between the parties which, in\nturn, can only be information of relevancy and materiality\nto the matters in controversy. Id. at 301.\n\n    We see no reason to exclude Relator's other personal\nfinancial records, such as her financial statements and\nrecords of household accounts from similar considerations.\n\n     We therefore hold Judge Millard abused his discretion\nin ordering Relator to produce her entire tax returns,\nfinancial statements, and personal household records\nwithout examining them and separating the relevant parts\nfrom the irrelevant. As stated in Maresca, 362 S.W.2d at\n301, it is not this court's function to supervise the trial judge\nin exercising his discretion in his rulings on relevancy and\nmateriality. However, we should grant extraordinary relief\nwhen no discretion has been exercised, as in the case before\nus.\n\n     We feel certain the trial judge will act in a manner\nconsistent with this opinion and that it will be unnecessary\nfor a writ of mandamus to issue at this time.

Based upon his May 12 order striking                    paragraph 2(b) explicitly requires that any sanctions\nTransAmerican's pleadings, the district court issued an           imposed be \"just\". By referring to paragraph 2(b),\norder on October 6 dismissing TransAmerican's action with         paragraph 3 incorporates the same requirement. Thus,\nprejudice, rendering an interlocutory default judgment            whether the district court imposed sanctions under\nagainst TransAmerican and in favor of Toma on its                 paragraph 2(b) or paragraph 3, we consider whether those\ncounterclaim, and setting the case for trial solely on the        sanctions were just.

First, a direct relationship\nof appeals to compel the district court to set aside his May      must exist between the offensive conduct and the sanction\n12 and October 6 orders. A divided court of appeals denied        imposed. This means that a just sanction must be directed\nTransAmerican leave to file its petition for writ of              against the abuse and toward remedying the prejudice\nmandamus in an unpublished per curiam opinion.

The trial court's         ---------\norder recites that the sanctions were imposed because\nrelator answered untruthfully in a prior hearing before the\ntrial court concerning the sale of his interest in the Malo\nSueno area. The court found that conduct to be in flagrant\nbad faith in the exercise of his responsibility for discovery,\nan abuse of discovery under Rule 215, and a violation of his\noath as a witness. The actions of relator in this case are not\nto be condoned. However, a trial court may not effectively\nadjudicate the merits of a case based on testimony of a party\nduring a sanctions hearing because he was later impeached\non testimony given at that hearing. The witness' credibility\nshould be tested when the case is tried. Otherwise, a trial\ncourt could at any time interrupt a trial proceeding if it\nbelieved a witness was being untruthful, and simply enter a\ndefault against the party procuring that witness for that\nreason. The statement of relator, whether perjurious or not,\ndoes not go to the heart of the controversy here. It did not\njustify the conclusion that relator's claim lacked merit so\nthat he should be precluded from his day in court.\n\n     We do not believe the action of the trial court was\njustified; the Transamerican factors were not met. There\nwas no showing that lesser sanctions would not have been\neffective.

Although the Court fully recognizes the severity of the\n2.

The Court finds that Chrysler, by and through its              Court;\nHouston counsel, has made repeated false and misleading\nstatements to the Court and to opposing counsel regarding         8. Chrysler's lengthy and continuous obstruction of\nthe status of discovery in this litigation, both in writing and   Plaintiffs' discovery efforts clearly justifies the presumption\nin open court;                                                    held by this Court that Chrysler believes its defenses to\n                                                                  Plaintiffs' allegations lack merit.\n3. The Court finds that the imposition of monetary\nsanctions as included in the Court's Order of March 8, 1991,      [14] See supra at n. 12.\nwas ineffective in causing Chrysler to alter its pattern of\nmisconduct; the Court finds that Chrysler has continued to        [15] As we have previously stated, the court has appointed\nengage in a continuing pattern of misconduct including            various task forces to study and recommend any needed\ndiscovery abuse and violations of this Court's orders             revisions in the Rules of Civil Procedure, including the\nfollowing this Court's Order for monetary sanctions;              rules relating to sanctions.

The Court finds that the offensive conduct is not\nattributable in any part to Corpus Christi counsel. The Court\nfinds that Chrysler itself, by and through its Discovery\nManager Jeffery Podorsek and its National Counsel David\nKikel, has been actively involved in the conduct at issue;\n\n5. The Court has considered for almost three and one-half\nmonths the availability of less stringent sanctions and\nwhether less stringent sanctions would fully promote\ncompliance by Chrysler with this Court's discovery order;\nthe Court had initially declined to strike Chrysler's\npleadings and has been seeking to determine less stringent\nsanctions which could be expected to obtain proper\ncompliance by Chrysler with this Court's orders and with\nthe discovery rules; the Court notes that substantial\nmonetary sanctions previously imposed herein on Chrysler\nhad not successfully promoted full compliance with this\nCourt's orders and that the pattern of misconduct has\ncontinued; the Court, reluctantly, finds that no sanction less\nstringent than those ordered herein will secure compliance\nwith the Court's orders and applicable rules;\n\n6. The Court finds that the discovery sought is directly,\nmaterially and substantially related to the major issues of\nthe case; Chrysler's refusal to comply with the discovery\nrules and orders of this Court prevent Plaintiffs from\npreparing their case for trial and preclude a fair trial under\n\fPage 725                                                          cable, which was several feet long, had been made by\n                                                                  unwinding the 18\"' flexible sheath that protected the cord of\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1510810\"><a href=\"/opinion/1510810/gte-communications-v-tanner/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1993)                                        electric wires connecting a telephone handset to the body of\n                                                                  a pay telephone mounted on the wall outside the grocery\nGTE      COMMUNICATIONS                           SYSTEMS         store.

While we do not disagree that the filing\n                                                                 of a motion for summary judgment may give rise to\n    Courts shall presume that pleadings, motions, and other      sanctions under Rule 13, just as the filing of any other\npapers are filed in good faith. No sanctions under this rule     pleading or motion, this is not such a case. At the time\nmay be imposed except for good cause, the particulars of         GCSC filed its motion, the only evidence adduced by the\nwhich must be stated in the sanction order. \"Groundless\" for     parties indicated that GCSC had not made or distributed the\npurposes of this rule means no basis in law or fact and not      sheathed cord. Indeed, plaintiffs themselves originally\nwarranted by good faith argument for the extension,              pleaded that ATS manufactured the cord, not GCSC. By\nmodification, or reversal of existing law.                       their own admission, plaintiffs did not develop any\n                                                                 evidence to contradict GCSC's assertions until after GCSC's\n     The district court sanctioned GCSC for filing amended       motion was denied. Even if GCSC was not entitled to\nanswers, a motion for summary judgment and the                   summary judgment, it cannot be said that its motion had no\nsupporting affidavits of Zimmerman and Jiminez, which            basis in law or fact.\ndeny that GCSC was involved in making or distributing the\nsheathed cord which caused plaintiffs' injuries. By its               Thus, the district court clearly abused its discretion in\nexpress language, Rule 13 applies only to pleadings,             determining that GCSC's assertions were groundless. To\nmotions and other papers signed by attorneys. Since the          impose sanctions under Rule 13, the district court was also\nZimmerman and Jiminez affidavits were not signed by              required to find that GCSC's assertions were made in bad\nGCSC's attorneys, it was a clear abuse of discretion for the     faith or for the purpose of harassment. Since plaintiffs do\ndistrict court to base an imposition of sanctions under Rule     not contend, and the district court did not find, that GCSC's\n13 on them. The issues, then, are whether the district court     assertions were harassing, a finding of bad faith was a\nabused its discretion GCSC's in concluding that GCSC's           prerequisite to sanctions. Rule 13 prescribes that courts\namended answers and motion for summary judgment are              presume that papers are filed in good faith. Thus, the burden\nsanctionable, and in striking GCSC's pleadings.                  is on the party moving for sanctions to overcome this\n                                                                 presumption. Plaintiffs failed to carry this burden. The only\n     Such papers cannot serve as a basis for sanctions under     basis the district court gave for finding that GCSC had\nthat portion of Rule 13 quoted above, and on which the           acted in bad faith was that GCSC had ignored or concealed\n\fevidence that it had been involved in making and                 TransAmerican, 811 S.W.2d at 920; Chrysler, 841 S.W.2d\ndistributing the sheathed cord that injured the plaintiffs. As   at 845 n. 2. For the same reasons expressed in those cases,\nwe have seen, however, there is no proof that GCSC, before       GCSC has no adequate remedy by appeal in this case, and\nit moved for summary judgment, was aware of any                  we exercise our discretion to issue the extraordinary writ.\nevidence that it was involved in the manufacture or\ndistribution of the sheathed cord.                                    We have held that an assessment of attorney fees which\n                                                                 is not to be paid until final judgment is rendered may be\n     Furthermore, a motion for summary judgment asserting        adequately challenged by appeal. Braden v. Downey, 811\nthat no genuine issue of material fact exists is not proved      S.W.2d 922 (Tex.1991). Here, however, where we have\ngroundless or in bad faith merely by the filing of a response    concluded in considering case determinative sanctions that\nwhich raises an issue of fact, even if the response was or       the district court clearly abused its discretion in awarding\ncould have been anticipated by the movant. Nor is denial of      any sanctions at all, there remains no basis for the award of\na motion for summary judgment alone grounds for                  attorney fees.\nsanctions. Rule 13 does not permit sanctions for every\npleading or motion that requests relief which is denied. In          Accordingly, we conclude that GCSC is entitled to\nthis case, the district court abused its discretion in finding   have the district court's sanction order set aside.\nthat GCSC had acted in bad faith.\n                                                                 ******\n     The district court also sanctioned GCSC for asserting in\nits motion for summary judgment that it did not know of               We therefore direct the district court to vacate its orders\nany defects in the sheathed cord and could not have              of November 14, 1991, and June 12, 1992, assessing\nforeseen an accident like plaintiffs', when it was aware of      sanctions and attorney fees. We assume the district court\nthe GTFL memo. Since we have determined that there is no         will promptly comply. The writ of mandamus will issue\nevidence that GCSC was aware of the GTFL memo when it            only if it does not.\nfiled its motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs have\n                                                                     DOGGETT and SPECTOR, JJ., not sitting.\noffered no other evidence of GCSC's knowledge of any\ndefects in the cord, we conclude that such assertions were\nnot groundless or made in bad faith.\n\n     Even if GCSC's assertions in its amended answers and\nmotion for summary judgment had been sanctionable, they\nwould not have warranted striking GCSC's pleadings. Rule\n13 requires that sanctions imposed be \"appropriate\", which\nis the equivalent of \"just\" under Rule 215. TransAmerican,\n811 S.W.2d at 916-17 n. 4. Neither standard allows\nimposition of excessive sanctions. Moreover, while the due\nprocess concerns under the two rules are not completely\ncongruent, case determinative sanctions may not be\nimposed under either rule unless the violation warrants\nadjudication of the merits. Even if GCSC had violated Rule\n13, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the\nviolation could not have been fully redressed far short of\nstriking GCSC's pleadings.\n\nPage 732\n\n    Thus, we hold that the district court clearly abused its\ndiscretion in imposing sanctions under Rule 13.\n\n    IV\n\n    Finally, we consider whether GCSC has an adequate\nremedy by appeal. We have previously held that appeal\nfrom the imposition of case determinative, or \"death\npenalty\", sanctions is inadequate, unless the sanctions are\nimposed simultaneously with a final, appealable judgment.\n\fPage 577                                                           Darcey testified in his deposition that Bailey had mild\n                                                                   asbestosis with no evidence of impairment.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1752239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1752239/norfolk-southern-ry-co-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App. —Austin 2002)\n                                                                          The case was reset for trial in late 1999 and again in\nNORFOLK         SOUTHERN         RAILWAY         COMPANY,          October 2001.
