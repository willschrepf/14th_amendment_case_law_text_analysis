According to the plaintiff’s\n\fversion of events, which is disputed by the defendants, he\n\nsuffered through a horrific eighteen-month period of\n\nincarceration during which the defendant prison officials failed\n\nto protect him from prison gangs who repeatedly raped him and\n\nbought and sold him as a sexual slave.   His complaint asserted\n\nviolations of the Eighth Amendment and the Equal Protection\n\nClause.   The district court denied the defendants’ motions for\n\njudgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment, and they now\n\nbring these interlocutory appeals.    The defendants argue that the\n\nplaintiff largely failed to exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nand that any exhausted claims are barred by qualified immunity.\n\nWe conclude that the majority, but not all, of the plaintiff’s\n\nclaims must be dismissed on grounds of failure to exhaust or\n\nqualified immunity.   We therefore affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand.\n\n                       I. GENERAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Roderick Johnson entered the Texas prison system in January\n\n2000 after the revocation of a sentence of probation that he had\n\nreceived for a nonviolent burglary.   He was transferred to the\n\nsystem’s Allred Unit on September 6, 2000.     Upon arriving at\n\nAllred, Johnson met with a three-person Unit Classification\n\nCommittee (UCC) for a determination of his initial housing\n\nstatus.   Prison officials knew that Johnson was homosexual and\n\npossessed an effeminate manner.   Johnson told the UCC that he had\n\n\n\n                                  2\n\fbeen housed in “safekeeping” before his transfer.1   Safekeeping\n\nis a housing status that separates vulnerable individuals from\n\nmore aggressive offenders.   According to Texas Department of\n\nCriminal Justice (TDCJ) regulations, safekeeping is indicated\n\nwhen an inmate is at risk of victimization, has enemies in the\n\npopulation, has a history of homosexuality, or possesses other\n\ncharacteristics that mark the offender as vulnerable to\n\npredation.   But according to Johnson, one of the members of the\n\nUCC told him that “[w]e don’t protect punks on this farm”--“punk”\n\nbeing prison slang for a homosexual man.   Johnson was put in the\n\ngeneral population.   He was raped by other inmates almost\n\nimmediately.\n\n     Johnson’s complaint and affidavit describe a horrific series\n\nof events that allegedly occurred over the next eighteen months\n\nat Allred.   In October 2000, not long after his arrival in the\n\ngeneral population, a prison gang member named Hernandez asserted\n\n“ownership” over Johnson, forcing Johnson to become his sexual\n\nservant.   Johnson informed Assistant Warden Mooneyham and\n\nSergeant Willingham of the rapes and requested medical attention,\n\n\n     1\n          The parties’ briefs take apparently conflicting\npositions on whether Johnson was housed in safekeeping before his\ntransfer. Johnson’s brief says that “he had been housed in\nsafekeeping just before he was transferred to Allred Unit.” But\nthe defendants say that “Johnson was not classified ‘safekeeping’\nprior to the his arrival at the Allred Unit.” It appears that\nboth sides are technically correct: Johnson was housed in\ntransient safekeeping shortly before his transfer, but he was not\nofficially classified to that status.\n\n                                 3\n\fbut they told him that care was available only for emergencies\n\nand that he should file a written request for medical attention.\n\nBy November, Hernandez began to rent Johnson out to perform\n\ncoerced sexual favors for other inmates.   Johnson believed that\n\nhe would be severely beaten or killed if he refused.   Hernandez\n\nbeat Johnson on November 30, and medical personnel documented\n\nbruising and swelling on Johnson’s face.   At several times over\n\nthe following months, Johnson was moved to different buildings at\n\nAllred and was raped and owned by different prison gangs.\n\n     Johnson sought help from guards, filed numerous “life-\n\nendangerment” forms, and wrote letters to prison administrators.\n\nPrison officers who investigated Johnson’s complaints generally\n\ndetermined that they could not be corroborated; the officers\n\nusually did not interview any of the inmates mentioned in\n\nJohnson’s complaints, purportedly out of a concern to protect the\n\n“integrity of the investigation” or to protect Johnson.\n\nJohnson’s life-endangerment forms triggered a number of\n\nappearances before UCCs composed of various prison officials and\n\nemployees.   Johnson asked the UCCs to place him in safekeeping\n\nstatus, place him in protective custody (which entails a\n\nsignificant loss of privileges), or transfer him to a different\n\nprison on multiple occasions: December 13, 2000; February 14,\n\n2001; February 21, 2001; March 16, 2001; September 5, 2001;\n\nDecember 13, 2001; and January 17, 2002.   Each time the committee\n\nrefused Johnson’s requests, ostensibly because there was no\n\n                                 4\n\fconcrete evidence of victimization.    According to Johnson, the\n\nmembers of the committees repeatedly told him that he either had\n\nto fight off his attackers or submit to being used for sex.    The\n\ncomments allegedly made by the UCC members, which they dispute,\n\ninclude statements such as: “You need to get down there and fight\n\nor get you a man,” “There’s no reason why Black punks can’t fight\n\nand survive in general population if they don’t want to f***,”\n\nand remarks to the effect that, since Johnson was homosexual, he\n\nprobably liked the sexual assaults he was experiencing.\n\n     In addition to writing letters to administrators and filing\n\nlife-endangerment notices, Johnson also used the TDCJ’s formal\n\ntwo-step administrative grievance process on several occasions.\n\nThe grievances described his victimization and his repeated\n\nunsuccessful requests for protection or a transfer to\n\nsafekeeping.    The grievances were denied, generally on the basis\n\nthat unit officials or UCC committees had already conducted\n\nproper investigations and had found no substantiating evidence.2\n\n     Johnson eventually contacted the American Civil Liberties\n\nUnion.    Shortly thereafter, Johnson went before the UCC again, on\n\nApril 1, 2002, and was approved for a transfer to TDCJ’s Michael\n\nUnit.    During his December 2002 deposition, Johnson testified\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Additional details regarding Johnson’s grievances are\nprovided later, in conjunction with our analysis of the\nexhaustion issue.\n\n                                  5\n\fthat he had not suffered attacks at the Michael Unit, where he\n\nwas housed in safekeeping.\n\n     Johnson filed suit in the district court in April 2002\n\nagainst over a dozen TDCJ officials and employees.       The\n\ndefendants comprise supervisory officials such as TDCJ Executive\n\nDirector Gary Johnson,3 Senior Warden Treon, Assistant Warden\n\nWathen, Assistant Warden Mooneyham, and Director of\n\nClassification Wright; guards who failed to protect Johnson on\n\ndiscrete occasions (namely, Lieutenant Paul4 and Sergeant\n\nWillingham); and many of the members of the various UCCs that had\n\ndenied Johnson protection (namely, Major Norwood, Major Bright,\n\nUCC Administrative Technician Kuyava, UCC Administrative\n\nTechnician Vitolo, Captain Boyle, Major Bowman, Lieutenant\n\nRanjel, and Lieutenant Taylor).5       The lengthy complaint asserted\n\nthree causes of action: (1) failure to protect Johnson from harm,\n\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment, (2) a race-based Equal\n\n\n\n     3\n          This defendant is referred to in this opinion as\n“Executive Director Johnson.” The name “Johnson” refers to the\nplaintiff, Roderick Johnson.\n     4\n          The incident involving Paul occurred in March 2002.\nAccording to Johnson, a group of inmates molested him and a\nmentally ill inmate in the showers. Afterward, Johnson told\nPaul, who offered no assistance and instead made menacing\ncomments to Johnson.\n     5\n          There is some overlap among these general categories of\ndefendants. For instance, Wathen sometimes sat on the UCC;\nMooneyham sat once on the UCC and (with Willingham) was involved\nin the October 2000 incident described earlier, in addition to\ncarrying out his supervisory responsibilities.\n\n                                   6\n\fProtection claim charging that officials denied him protection\n\nbecause he is black, and (3) a sexual-orientation-based Equal\n\nProtection claim predicated on the allegation that the defendants\n\ndenied Johnson protection out of anti-homosexual animus.   The\n\nsuit sought injunctive relief and damages.   The defendants\n\nanswered Johnson’s complaint with a blanket denial of almost all\n\nof its allegations.\n\n     In July 2002, Executive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright\n\nmoved for judgment on the pleadings on Johnson’s Equal Protection\n\nclaims (but not the Eighth Amendment claim).   The plaintiff did\n\nnot oppose this motion, and the district court later granted it.\n\n     In November 2002, all of the defendants filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,\n\nand, at the same time, all of the defendants who were still\n\nfacing Equal Protection claims (i.e., all defendants but\n\nExecutive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright) filed a motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings with regard to the Equal Protection\n\nclaims.6   The motion for judgment on the pleadings asserted,\n\ninter alia, an entitlement to qualified immunity on the ground\n\nthat Johnson had not alleged violations of rights that were\n\nclearly established.\n\n     6\n          At the same time, two of the defendants (Executive\nDirector Johnson and Paul) also sought judgment on the pleadings\nwith regard to Johnson’s Eighth Amendment claim. The other\ndefendants, however, did not challenge the Eighth Amendment\ntheory at the pleadings stage.\n\n\n                                 7\n\f     While those motions were still pending, the defendants also\n\nfiled, in January 2003, a motion for summary judgment on the\n\nEighth Amendment claims, again asserting qualified immunity among\n\nother grounds.   The motion also reasserted the defendants’\n\narguments concerning Johnson’s Equal Protection claims.\n\n     On April 9, 2003, the district court denied the defendants’\n\nJanuary 2003 motion for summary judgment in an order stating that\n\nfact issues remained regarding whether the defendants acted with\n\ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk to Johnson’s\n\nsafety; the court further held that the factual disputes\n\nprecluded a ruling on qualified immunity on the current record.\n\nThe court’s order also rejected the defendants’ exhaustion\n\nargument, which they had re-urged in their motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n     The defendants then requested a ruling on the still-pending\n\nNovember 2002 motion for judgment on the pleadings, which largely\n\nconcerned the Equal Protection claims.   On April 17, 2003, the\n\ncourt denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding\n\nthat Johnson’s pleadings adequately stated a claim.   The order\n\nalso denied as moot the motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust,\n\nas the court’s previous order had rejected that argument.\n\nFinally, the order denied as moot the request for qualified\n\nimmunity, the court having already determined that material fact\n\nissues required trial.\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f     The defendants filed a notice of appeal from the April 9\n\norder denying summary judgment, and this became appeal No. 03-\n\n10455.    Later, they filed a notice of appeal from the April 17\n\norder denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings--docketed\n\nas appeal No. 03-10505.    Both interlocutory appeals are\n\npredicated on the rule that denials of qualified immunity based\n\non issues of law are immediately appealable under the collateral\n\norder doctrine.    See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 524-30\n\n(1985).    The district court later certified, and this court\n\ngranted leave to pursue, an interlocutory appeal of the district\n\ncourt’s ruling that Johnson had exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies--appeal No. 03-10722.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n     Johnson has filed motions to dismiss Nos. 03-10505 and 03-\n\n10455 for want of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n     On December 19, 2003, Johnson was released from prison into\n\nmandatory supervision at a halfway house.    The defendants have\n\nargued, and the plaintiff conceded at oral argument, that\n\nJohnson’s claims for injunctive relief and his claims against the\n\ndefendants in their official capacities have been rendered moot,\n\nleaving only his claims against the defendants in their\n\nindividual capacities for damages.\n\n                           II. EXHAUSTION\n\n     Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), prisoners are\n\nrequired to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit:\n\n\n\n                                  9\n\f“No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions\n\nunder section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a\n\nprisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional\n\nfacility until such administrative remedies as are available are\n\nexhausted.”   42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2000).   The defendants argue\n\nthat Johnson’s grievances were insufficiently detailed, untimely,\n\nor both, thus failing to exhaust his administrative remedies.     We\n\nreview de novo the district court’s denial of the motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to exhaust.    Richardson v. Spurlock, 260 F.3d\n\n495, 499 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n     The Texas prison system has developed a two-step formal\n\ngrievance process.    The Step 1 grievance, which must be filed\n\nwithin fifteen days of the complained-of incident, is handled\n\nwithin the prisoner’s facility.    After an adverse decision at\n\nStep 1, the prisoner has ten days to file a Step 2 grievance,\n\nwhich is handled at the state level.    This court has previously\n\nheld that a prisoner must pursue a grievance through both steps\n\nfor it to be considered exhausted.     See Wright v. Hollingsworth,\n\n260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n     The record in this case includes portions of the guidelines\n\nthat TDCJ provides prisoners regarding how to file grievances.\n\nAmong other things, the rules direct inmates to write “briefly\n\nand clearly” but also to “be very specific about your grievance\n\nor your problem.”    They state that a grievance should contain\n\nfacts, not legal words or conclusions.    They further direct the\n\n                                  10\n\fprisoner to “[t]ell us what action you want us to take to resolve\n\nyour grievance or problem,” but they specifically state that a\n\nprisoner should “not ask us to take disciplinary action against\n\nemployees.”   The guidelines state that an inmate should not\n\n“submit repetitive grievances on the same issue.”   Finally, they\n\nwarn that an inmate is subject to sanctions for abusing the\n\ngrievance process, such as by making “excessive, frivolous and\n\nvexatious use of the procedure.”\n\n     In addition to writing many administrative life-\n\nendangerment notices and letters, Johnson twice filed formal\n\ngrievances on TDCJ-provided standard forms and pursued them\n\nthrough the two-step process just described.    In particular, he\n\nfiled Step 1 grievances on March 18, 2001 and December 30, 2001,\n\nboth times appealing the matter to Step 2 after being denied at\n\nStep 1.    (He filed Step 1 grievances on a few other occasions as\n\nwell, but he did not fully exhaust them by proceeding through\n\nStep 2.)   Johnson’s complaint included an allegation that he had\n\nexhausted available administrative remedies.7\n\n     7\n          Before turning to the substance of the exhaustion\nrequirement, we observe that there is a threshold issue regarding\nwhether the defendants properly raised the exhaustion issue.\nThough the defendants raised exhaustion in their motions for\njudgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment, their answer\nto Johnson’s complaint did not raise the issue. Johnson argues\nthat exhaustion is an affirmative defense and points to the\ngeneral rule, see Giles v. Gen. Elec. Co., 245 F.3d 474, 491-92\n(5th Cir. 2001), that affirmative defenses not raised in the\nanswer are ordinarily deemed waived. The defendants contend that\nexhaustion is not an affirmative defense but is instead part of\nthe plaintiff’s cause of action.\n\n                                 11\n\f     Section 1997e(a) does not say how specific a prisoner’s\n\nadministrative grievances must be, and this court has so far\n\ngiven relatively little guidance regarding what a prisoner must\n\nsay in his grievances to exhaust his claims properly.    As a\n\ngeneral matter, courts typically use a standard according to\n\nwhich a grievance should give prison officials “fair notice” of\n\nthe problem that will form the basis of the prisoner’s suit.\n\nSee, e.g., Burton v. Jones, 321 F.3d 569, 575 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\nThe parties agree on that generalized formulation but,\n\n\n     As Johnson accurately points out, the substantial majority\nof courts of appeals that have considered the question hold that\nexhaustion is an affirmative defense, generally reasoning that it\nis similar to a statute-of-limitations defense. See, e.g.,\nCasanova v. Dubois, 304 F.3d 75, 77 n.3 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing\ncases). But see Steele v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 355 F.3d 1204,\n1209-10 (10th Cir. 2003) (taking the contrary view and requiring\nprisoners to allege and show exhaustion of administrative\nremedies). Some prior decisions of this court seem to imply or\nassume that exhaustion is a component of the plaintiff’s claim,\nnot an affirmative defense that must be raised and proved by the\ndefendants. See, e.g., Days v. Johnson, 322 F.3d 863, 868 (5th\nCir. 2003); Wendell v. Asher, 162 F.3d 887, 892 (5th Cir. 1998);\nUnderwood v. Wilson, 151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir. 1998). But,\narguably, these cases have not directly decided the question.\nAssuming arguendo that the question is as-yet undecided, we have\nno occasion to decide it here. While failure to raise an\naffirmative defense in the answer generally results in a waiver,\nnoncompliance can be excused if the defendant raises the issue at\na “pragmatically sufficient” time and there is no prejudice to\nthe plaintiff. See Giles, 245 F.3d at 491-92. The defendants\nraised the exhaustion issue in their motion for judgment on the\npleadings, and here it does not appear that Johnson was surprised\nin any way, as might happen when a party waits until shortly\nbefore trial to raise a new defense. Moreover, failure to plead\nexhaustion in the answer is especially excusable here given that\nthe law on the topic is not clearly settled. See Foulk v.\nCharrier, 262 F.3d 687, 697 (8th Cir. 2001) (excusing defendant’s\nfailure to raise exhaustion in a timely manner because circuit\nlaw regarding PLRA exhaustion was unsettled at the time).\n\n                               12\n\funsurprisingly, they differ on how much detail is required in\n\norder to provide notice of the prisoner’s problem.\n\n     In deciding how much detail is required in a given case, we\n\nbelieve that a court must interpret the exhaustion requirement in\n\nlight of its purposes, which include the goal of giving officials\n\n“time and opportunity to address complaints internally,” Porter\n\nv. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 525 (2002).   Thus, a grievance should be\n\nconsidered sufficient to the extent that the grievance gives\n\nofficials a fair opportunity to address the problem that will\n\nlater form the basis of the lawsuit.   Further, as a practical\n\nmatter, the amount of information necessary will likely depend to\n\nsome degree on the type of problem about which the inmate is\n\ncomplaining.   If an inmate claims that a guard acted improperly,\n\nwe can assume that the administrators responding to the grievance\n\nwould want to know--and a prisoner could ordinarily be expected\n\nto provide--details regarding who was involved and when the\n\nincident occurred, or at least other available information about\n\nthe incident that would permit an investigation of the matter.\n\nIn contrast, a grievance in which an inmate says that his cell is\n\nhabitually infested with vermin, or that the prices in the\n\ncommissary are too high, could adequately alert administrators to\n\nthe problem whether or not the grievance names anyone.   Compare\n\nCurry v. Scott, 249 F.3d 493, 505 (6th Cir. 2001) (holding that a\n\ngrievance specifically complaining of a beating at the hands of\n\none guard did not suffice to exhaust a failure-to-protect claim\n\n                                13\n\fagainst another guard, not mentioned in the grievance, who stood\n\nby and watched), with Brown v. Sikes, 212 F.3d 1205, 1207-10\n\n(11th Cir. 2000) (holding that a prisoner who knew only that he\n\nhad not received prescribed medical equipment had exhausted his\n\nclaim, notwithstanding that his grievance did not name anyone).\n\n     Beyond those general practical considerations, the prison\n\nsystem’s own rules regarding grievances provide both inmates and\n\nthe courts with more specific guidance.   Since prisoners are\n\ngenerally required to follow the procedures adopted by the state\n\nprison system, the specificity requirement should be interpreted\n\nin light of the grievance rules of the particular prison system,\n\nhere the TDCJ.   See Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 649 (7th Cir.\n\n2002) (“[G]rievances must contain the sort of information that\n\nthe administrative system requires.”).8   Thus, in deciding\n\nwhether the grievance gives officials an opportunity to address\n\nthe problem, we should consider whether the grievance provides\n\nthe type of information that the TDCJ rules request.\n\n     The defendants raise three distinct types of exhaustion\n\narguments on appeal: They argue that Johnson did not exhaust (1)\n\ncertain of his legal theories (2) regarding certain episodes (3)\n\n\n\n     8\n          The Strong opinion qualified its holding by noting that\na state’s procedures would be invalid if they established\nrequirements inconsistent with the federal policies behind § 1983\nand § 1997e(a). 297 F.3d at 649. In other words, a state could\nnot make grievance rules that prevented the vindication of\nsubstantive rights.\n\n                                14\n\fagainst certain defendants.   We consider each in turn, and we\n\nconclude that many of Johnson’s claims are unexhausted.\n\nA.   Which theories?\n\n     Johnson’s suit contains Eighth Amendment claims, race-based\n\nEqual Protection claims, and claims for failure to protect\n\nbecause of sexual orientation under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nWe begin with the question of which of those three categories of\n\nclaims were exhausted.\n\n     As a general matter, there is authority from several courts\n\nto the effect that a prisoner, who is of course typically\n\nuncounseled, need not present legal theories in his grievances.\n\nSee, e.g., Burton, 321 F.3d at 575 (“[W]e would not require a\n\nprisoner’s grievance to allege a specific legal theory or facts\n\nthat correspond to all the required elements of a particular\n\nlegal theory.”); see also Strong, 297 F.3d at 650 (concluding\n\nthat a prisoner need not present legal theories, at least as long\n\nas prison rules do not require that).   We agree.   As we discussed\n\nabove, the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to give\n\nprison administrators an opportunity to address a problem, and\n\nthey can do this whether or not the prisoner tells them the\n\nconstitutional provisions that the problem implicates.    Further,\n\nTDCJ rules specifically instruct inmates to provide facts, not\n\nlegal terminology.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f     Johnson’s grievances repeatedly refer to the defendants’\n\nfailure to protect him from assaults and (though this was\n\nunnecessary) specifically name the Eighth Amendment.    The\n\ndefendants admit that the grievances exhausted Eighth Amendment\n\nclaims, at least against a few defendants regarding a few\n\ninstances--matters that we will discuss later.     They also argue,\n\nhowever, that the grievances do not exhaust any of Johnson’s two\n\ntypes of Equal Protection claims against any defendant.\n\n     Race.   As to race discrimination, the defendants correctly\n\nobserve that Johnson’s grievances nowhere state that he was\n\nsuffering racial discrimination.     Indeed, his grievances do not\n\nmention his race at all.   Even though Johnson need not present a\n\nfull-fledged legal theory in his grievance, his grievances must\n\nalert prison officials to a problem and give them an opportunity\n\nto address it.   His grievances gave them notice that there was a\n\nproblem with protection from sexual assaults, but we do not think\n\nthat they can be read to give notice that there was a race-\n\nrelated problem.   See Medera v. Griffin, No. 02 C 1064, 2003 WL\n\n132496, at *11 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 14, 2003) (holding that grievances\n\nregarding prison conditions that allegedly violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment did not exhaust an Equal Protection claim where the\n\ngrievances contained “no mention whatsoever of the plaintiff’s\n\nheritage, nor any references to racial slurs”).9\n\n     9\n          To be sure, Johnson’s Eighth Amendment and Equal\nProtection claims are not wholly unrelated: His race, he claims,\n\n                                16\n\f     Sexual orientation.    Johnson’s grievances mention his sexual\n\norientation many times.    For the most part, the references to\n\nJohnson’s sexuality are intertwined with Johnson’s complaints\n\nabout the officials’ failure to protect him from assaults.      The\n\ndefendants contend that this does not necessarily indicate that\n\nJohnson was complaining that the officials were purposefully\n\ndiscriminating against him, by refusing to protect him, because\n\nof his homosexuality.    The grievances are certainly not as\n\nexplicit as one would expect from a lawyer, but as we stated\n\nabove a prisoner need not provide all of the elements of a\n\nconstitutional claim as long as the grievance at least reasonably\n\nindicates a problem.    Further, Johnson’s grievances do also\n\nsuggest a complaint that the officials considered Johnson’s\n\nsexuality: Johnson writes that members of the UCC responded to\n\nhis requests for protection from rape by saying “that they feel\n\nthat because I’m a homosexual I’m enticing [illegible].”    In\n\naddition, a reasonable reader could infer that the officials\n\nwould not tell a heterosexual inmate that, instead of getting\n\n\n\nis part of the reason why the defendants failed to protect him.\nCf. Burton, 321 F.3d at 577. Nonetheless, these claims reflect\ndistinct problems with prison staff, and a grievance that\nsuggested a racial component to Johnson’s situation could be\nexpected to produce a different type of administrative response.\nCf. Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 (explaining that one purpose of the\nexhaustion requirement is the creation of an “administrative\nrecord that clarifies the contours of the controversy”).   We do\nnot believe that it is too much to ask that a prisoner at least\nsuggest a racial component if he is later going to sue on that\nground.\n\n                                 17\n\fprotection from victimization, he should “choose someone to be\n\nwith.”   Under the circumstances, we conclude that Johnson’s\n\ngrievances were sufficient to give prison officials fair notice\n\nthat there might have been a sexual-orientation-related aspect to\n\nJohnson’s problem.\n\nB.   Which incidents?\n\n     Having decided which general theories Johnson may pursue, we\n\nturn next to examining which events he has exhausted.\n\n     Johnson’s claim is that prison officials failed to protect\n\nhim, over the course of some eighteen months, from near-constant\n\nsexual assault.   Johnson’s complaint, and his summary-judgment\n\nevidence, covers the repeated abuses in uncomfortable detail and\n\nlists many unsuccessful encounters with prison officials.    These\n\ninclude face-to-face encounters with several guards who allegedly\n\nfailed to take steps to protect Johnson on various occasions,\n\ncorrespondence with supervisory officials, and meetings with UCC\n\ncommittees.   The defendants contend that the only exhausted\n\nclaims in this case are those against two defendants, Wathen and\n\nKuyava, as regards their involvement in the March 16, 2001 UCC.\n\nThey reason that since TDCJ rules require that a Step 1 grievance\n\nbe filed within fifteen days of the complained-of event, a\n\ngrievance can only exhaust claims that relate to matters that\n\noccurred within the preceding fifteen days.   Therefore, Johnson’s\n\nMarch 18 Step 1 grievance could exhaust claims arising from the\n\n\n\n                                18\n\fMarch 16, 2001 UCC, but it could not exhaust any claims that\n\narise from conduct before March 2001.   Johnson’s December 2001\n\nStep 1 grievance, which was also appealed through Step 2, failed\n\nto exhaust any claims, continue the defendants, because no UCC\n\nmeeting occurred in the fifteen days preceding the filing of that\n\nStep 1 grievance.\n\n     Johnson did not use the formal grievance process--or,\n\nrather, he did not properly use it by both filing a Step 1\n\ngrievance and appealing the grievance to Step 2--until his March\n\n18, 2001 Step 1 grievance.   We agree with the defendants that\n\nJohnson has not exhausted any claims that arise from events that\n\noccurred more than fifteen days before this grievance.     While it\n\nis true that the conditions that Johnson suffered both before and\n\nafter the grievance were of the same general character, to permit\n\nthe March 2001 grievance to reach back to events that transpired\n\nup to six months earlier would effectively negate the state’s\n\nfifteen-day rule and frustrate the prison system’s legitimate\n\ninterest in investigating complaints while they are still fresh.\n\nThat a condition continues does not excuse the failure to file a\n\ngrievance earlier.   Accordingly, we hold that Johnson’s\n\ngrievances do not permit him to pursue claims regarding conduct\n\nthat occurred before March 2001; in particular, this means that\n\nhe has not exhausted claims related to the UCC meetings of\n\nSeptember 6, 2000, December 13, 2000, February 14, 2001, and\n\nFebruary 21, 2001; nor has he exhausted claims regarding his\n\n                                19\n\fencounters with Willingham, which all occurred before March\n\n2001.10\n\n     Having concluded that Johnson’s March 2001 grievance did not\n\nexhaust claims that involve events before the March 2001 UCC\n\nmeeting, we next consider whether Johnson has exhausted claims\n\nrelated to conduct that occurred after the March 2001 grievance.\n\nThe defendants contend that no such claims were exhausted because\n\nnone of the three subsequent UCC meetings at which Johnson was\n\ndenied protection--which occurred in September 2001, December\n\n2001, and January 2002--was followed within fifteen days by a\n\nStep 1 grievance.   In particular, Johnson’s December 30, 2001\n\nStep 1 grievance was a few days too late to reach the December\n\n2001 UCC meeting, which was held on the 13th.\n\n     We do not agree with the defendants’ argument that Johnson\n\nhas not exhausted any claims that arise from events later than\n\nthe March 16, 2001 UCC meeting.    The March 2001 grievance alerted\n\nprison officials to the fact that Johnson was being subjected to\n\nrepeated assaults and was not receiving any protection from the\n\nsystem, in particular a transfer to safekeeping status:\n\n     I am writing to state that I am a homosexual who and\n     [sic] is still being assaulted sexually, physically,\n     mentally.    I have brought this issue up to unit\n     administration a number of times and have failed to be\n\n     10\n          We pause to note that our holding does not mean that\ninformation regarding unexhausted events cannot be used as\nevidence, if relevant and otherwise admissible, in proving claims\nthat are exhausted. Cf. United States v. Ashdown, 509 F.2d 793,\n798 (5th Cir. 1975).\n\n                              20\n\f     moved to a safe location that houses other homosexuals.\n     . . . Get me off this building or this unit before I am\n     assaulted again. . . . I have used all the proper\n     channels to resolve this problem but they simply refuse\n     to listen. Please get the warden or U.C.C. to move me\n     off this building . . . . They have failed to provide me\n     safety.\n\nThe grievance investigation worksheet corresponding to this Step\n\n1 grievance summarizes the issue as “being assaulted,” and the\n\nadministration responded to Johnson’s grievance by writing that a\n\nUCC had already been convened in response to Johnson’s life-\n\nendangerment notices and had found his claims insufficient.\n\n(That is, administrators did not take Johnson’s grievance as a\n\ncomplaint about only the prior UCC per se,11 but rather they\n\nviewed the UCC as part of their response to the problem of being\n\nattacked.)   After the officials rejected Johnson’s grievance, the\n\nsame condition of confinement of which he had been complaining\n\ncontinued.\n\n     After one full trip through the two-step review process,\n\nJohnson later filed the December 30, 2001 Step 1 grievance,\n\nwhich, according to the defendants, exhausted nothing because the\n\nmost recent prior UCC was on December 13, more than fifteen days\n\nearlier.   In this grievance Johnson reports that he is still\n\n“constantly” being threatened and harassed, that he is “subject\n\n\n     11\n          By way of comparison, inmates sometimes do claim that\nthe procedures or outcome of a particular administrative hearing\nviolated their rights. See, e.g., Black v. Warren, 134 F.3d 732\n(5th Cir. 1998); Banuelos v. McFarland, 41 F.3d 232 (5th Cir.\n1995).\n\n                                21\n\fto being bought and sold by gang members,” and that he has not\n\nbeen moved despite asking the staff and the UCCs for help\n\n“numerous times.”   Notably, the prison administration did not\n\nreject this grievance as being an untimely attempt to grieve the\n\nresults of the December 13 UCC.    Cf. Gates v. Cook, __ F.3d __,\n\n2004 WL 1440601, at *5 & n.6 (5th Cir. June 28, 2004) (holding\n\nthat prison officials could not argue that a prisoner’s grievance\n\nfailed to comply with procedural rules when the officials had\n\nlooked past the purported technical defect and rejected the\n\ngrievance for substantive reasons); accord Riccardo v. Rausch,\n\n375 F.3d 521, 523-24 (7th Cir. 2004).   Rather, their internal\n\ndocuments portrayed this grievance as another complaint about\n\nbeing attacked, and the administration rejected it on the ground\n\nthat they had already answered Johnson’s complaints about safety\n\nin their response to a prior Step 1 grievance that was filed\n\nshortly before the December 13 UCC meeting.    Thus, the prison\n\nadministration itself evidently did not understand Johnson’s\n\ngrievance as a complaint about the December 13 UCC meeting in\n\nparticular, but instead as a complaint about a continued lack of\n\nprotection.12\n\n     12\n          The grievance investigation form corresponding to the\nDecember 30 Step 1 grievance states, in the “Summary of Issue”\nsection, “Dupl. 2002058973.” This presumably means that\nadministrators understood it to duplicate grievance # 2002058973,\nwhich was filed on December 5 and which, in turn, was summarized\nby administrators as “[inmate] wants protection.” The grievance\ninvestigation form corresponding to the Step 2 appeal describes\nthe issue as a complaint about being threatened and harassed.\n\n                                  22\n\f     As a practical matter, Johnson could not have been expected\n\nto file a new grievance every fifteen days, or each time he was\n\nassaulted (which, according to him, was virtually every day), for\n\nthe entire period during which he remained unprotected in the\n\ngeneral population.   Persuasive authority holds that, in such\n\ncircumstances, prisoners need not continue to file grievances\n\nabout the same issue.   See Sulton v. Wright, 265 F. Supp. 2d 292,\n\n295-99 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (holding that two grievances filed during\n\nthe course of a several-year period of repeated delays in\n\ntreating an inmate’s injured knee sufficed to exhaust the entire\n\ncourse of conduct, despite the prison system’s rule that\n\ngrievances must be filed within fourteen days of an occurrence);\n\nAiello v. Litscher, 104 F. Supp. 2d 1068, 1074 (W.D. Wis. 2000)\n\n(holding that when inmates have filed a grievance regarding a\n\nprison policy, they need not file grievances regarding subsequent\n\nincidents in which the policy is applied); cf. Lewis v.\n\nWashington, 197 F.R.D. 611, 614 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (holding that\n\ninmates complaining about various aspects of the conditions in\n\ntheir housing unit need only grieve their placement in that unit,\n\nnot each of the various alleged unconstitutional conditions\n\npresent in the unit; “[o]therwise the defendants could obstruct\n\nlegal remedies to unconstitutional actions by subdividing the\n\ngrievances . . . .”).   Further, the TDCJ rules specifically\n\ndirect prisoners not to file repetitive grievances about the same\n\nissue and hold out the threat of sanctions for excessive use of\n\n                                23\n\fthe grievance process.    It would make little sense to require a\n\nprisoner being subjected to a frigid cell to continue to file\n\ngrievances stating that the cell remains frigid, and the same\n\nprinciple applies here.    Cf. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 303\n\n(1991) (referring to “the temperature he is subjected to in his\n\ncell, and the protection he is afforded against other inmates”\n\nboth as “conditions of confinement” subject to the Eighth\n\nAmendment).\n\n     Given the circumstances of this case and the nature of\n\nJohnson’s complaint, we do not believe that he was required to\n\nfile repeated grievances reminding the prison officials that he\n\nremained subject to attack in the general population.   Johnson’s\n\ngrievances were sufficient to exhaust claims that arose from the\n\nsame continuing failure to protect him from sexual assault.\n\nThus, we disagree with the defendants’ suggestion that he has\n\nfailed to exhaust any claims relating to the September 2001,\n\nDecember 2001, and January 2002 UCC meetings.13\n\n     13\n          We pause to observe that we do not here hold that a\ngrievance filed in response to one particular incident\nautomatically exhausts claims that arise from future incidents of\nthe same general type. Thus, an inmate who claims to have been\nbeaten by guards (or, for that matter, not protected by guards)\nonce one month and again the next month can rightfully be\nexpected to grieve both incidents, following TDCJ’s fifteen-day\nrule in each case. Nor do we hold that Johnson would not be\nrequired to file additional grievances for future incidents that\nreflect a different problem. For instance, Johnson’s claims\nagainst Lieutenant Paul stem solely from the March 2002 incident\nin which Paul responded indifferently after Johnson reported\nbeing harassed in the shower. This discrete incident reflects a\ndifferent type of problem that would require a different\n\n                                 24\n\fC.   Which defendants?\n\n     Johnson has sued fifteen prison officials, but the\n\ndefendants contend that he has not exhausted his claims against\n\nmany of them.   In particular, they argue that a claim against a\n\nperson has been exhausted only if that person was identified in\n\nthe prisoner’s Step 1 grievance.\n\n     We are mindful that the primary purpose of a grievance is to\n\nalert prison officials to a problem, not to provide personal\n\nnotice to a particular official that he may be sued; the\n\ngrievance is not a summons and complaint that initiates\n\nadversarial litigation.    Cf. Brown, 212 F.3d at 1207-10\n\n(rejecting a rule that a prisoner must always name defendants in\n\nhis grievance).   But, at the same time, the grievance must\n\nprovide administrators with a fair opportunity under the\n\ncircumstances to address the problem that will later form the\n\nbasis of the suit, and for many types of problems this will often\n\nrequire, as a practical matter, that the prisoner’s grievance\n\nidentify individuals who are connected with the problem.\n\n     Non-UCC defendants.   Two of the defendants in this case,\n\nPaul and Willingham, are prison guards who are accused of failing\n\nto protect Johnson on a few discrete occasions.   The character of\n\nJohnson’s formal grievances is that he is frequently being\n\n\ngrievance. (Indeed, we will hold in the next section of the\nopinion that Johnson has not exhausted his claims against Paul.)\n\n\n\n                                 25\n\fassaulted and has repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought a change\n\nin housing status through the established administrative\n\nchannels.    Nowhere does he mention or describe Paul or\n\nWillingham.    Johnson’s grievances would alert administrators\n\nparticularly to problems regarding the prison’s housing and\n\nclassification practices, but we do not think that they can\n\nfairly be read to alert them to, or give them an opportunity to\n\nremedy, the discrete conduct that forms the basis of Johnson’s\n\nclaims against these two officers, which is of a different\n\ncharacter.    (In addition, as observed above, all of the conduct\n\nconcerning Willingham occurred before March 2001, which is an\n\nindependent reason to hold it unexhausted.)\n\n     Johnson has also sued three supervisory-level officials who\n\nnever sat on a UCC: Treon, Wright, and Executive Director\n\nJohnson.    Johnson specifically named Treon and Wright, but only\n\nin Step 2 grievances.    The defendants contend that this is\n\ninsufficient, for TDCJ rules instruct inmates not to “bring up\n\nnew grievance issues on appeal.”      But cf. Burton, 321 F.3d at 574\n\n(permitting a prisoner to provide “additional factual detail” at\n\nappellate stages of grievance process).     Johnson’s grievances did\n\nnot mention Executive Director Johnson, but Johnson says that\n\nthere is no need to mention the Executive Director.      See Brown,\n\n212 F.3d at 1209 (observing that “[e]veryone involved in the\n\ngrievance process knows who the warden and [state prison]\n\ncommissioner are”).    We need not struggle with these matters\n\n                                 26\n\fhere, however, because we determine in Part III of our opinion\n\nthat these three supervisory defendants are clearly entitled to\n\ndismissal based on qualified immunity.14\n\n     UCC defendants.   We held above that Johnson had not\n\nexhausted any claims related to UCC meetings before March 2001.\n\nWe now ask whether, regarding the exhausted UCC meetings,\n\nJohnson’s grievances adequately identified the relevant\n\ndefendants.\n\n     The defendants conceded at oral argument, and we agree, that\n\na grievance can sufficiently identify a person even if it does\n\nnot provide an actual name; functional descriptions and the like-\n\n-e.g., a reference to “the guards in the shower room” on a\n\ncertain date--would suffice.   Cf. id. at 1209-10 & n.4 (noting\n\nprison administrators’ superior access to personnel information\n\nand records).   As we have already said, Johnson’s grievances\n\nrepeatedly refer to the UCC committees and their failure to\n\nbelieve his pleas and take measures to protect him.   This was\n\nadequate to put the prison administrators on notice that members\n\nof the UCCs were connected, indeed most closely connected, with\n\nJohnson’s problem.\n\nD.   Summary\n\n     Drawing together the threads of the three arguments\n\nconsidered above, we conclude that many of Johnson’s claims were\n\n     14\n          We note that the exhaustion requirement is not\njurisdictional. See Underwood, 151 F.3d at 294-95.\n\n                                27\n\fnot exhausted and should have been dismissed.    All of his race-\n\nbased Equal Protection claims are unexhausted, as are all claims\n\nagainst defendants Paul and Willingham.   So too are all claims\n\nrelated to all UCC meetings before the March 2001 meeting; in\n\nparticular, Johnson may not now pursue claims against Bright and\n\nKuyava as regards the September 6, 2000 UCC; Mooneyham and Vitolo\n\nas regards the December 13, 2000 UCC; Bowman, Boyle, and Kuyava\n\nas regards the February 14, 2001 UCC; and Vitolo and Wathen as\n\nregards the February 21, 2001 UCC.\n\n     The claims that are exhausted are Johnson’s Eighth Amendment\n\nclaims and his claims for failure to protect because of sexual\n\norientation under the Equal Protection Clause against Wathen and\n\nKuyava as regards the March 16, 2001 UCC; Wathen as regards the\n\nSeptember 5, 2001 UCC; Bowman, Kuyava, and Ranjel as regards the\n\nDecember 13, 2001 UCC; and Norwood, Vitolo, and Taylor as regards\n\nthe January 17, 2002 UCC.15\n\n     Finally, we find it unnecessary to reach a decision on\n\nexhaustion regarding the claims against Executive Director\n\nJohnson, Treon, and Wright.\n\n                  III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          We observe that the defendants have not argued in favor\nof a total exhaustion rule according to which an entire lawsuit\nmust be dismissed without prejudice when certain claims are\nexhausted but others are not.\n\n\n                               28\n\f     The defendants also appeal, in No. 03-10455, the district\n\ncourt’s denial of their motion for summary judgment on Johnson’s\n\nEighth Amendment claims.   Of course, in accordance with our\n\nrulings above, we need only consider those claims that Johnson\n\nexhausted.\n\nA.   Appellate jurisdiction in No. 03-10455\n\n     We begin by noting that Johnson has filed a motion to\n\ndismiss No. 03-10455 for want of appellate jurisdiction.\n\nAlthough a public official claiming qualified immunity can as a\n\ngeneral matter immediately appeal a denial of summary judgment,\n\nsee Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 524-30 (1985), we lack\n\ninterlocutory jurisdiction to review the district court’s\n\nconclusion that the plaintiff has created a genuine issue of fact\n\nas to some matter.   See Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 313, 319-\n\n20 (1995).   Johnson points out that the district court’s order\n\ndenying summary judgment specifically stated that genuine\n\ndisputes of material fact existed that precluded a ruling on the\n\nimmunity defense.\n\n     As the Supreme Court explained in Behrens v. Pelletier, 516\n\nU.S. 299 (1996), Johnson does not mean that there is no\n\ninterlocutory appellate jurisdiction whenever the district\n\ncourt’s order denying summary judgment states that fact questions\n\nremain.   Rather, Johnson means only that the district court’s\n\nruling cannot be appealed to the extent that the official seeks\n\n\n\n                                29\n\fto challenge the district court’s determinations regarding the\n\nsufficiency of the summary-judgment record.    Id. at 313.\n\n“Johnson permits [a defendant official] to claim on appeal that\n\nall of the conduct which the District Court deemed sufficiently\n\nsupported for purposes of summary judgment met the Harlow\n\nstandard of ‘objective legal reasonableness.’” Id.    Yet while the\n\nappeal will not be dismissed, we are nonetheless required to\n\nlimit our review along the lines described in Johnson and\n\nBehrens.   That is, we may not consider any of the defendants’\n\narguments that challenge the district court’s assessment that\n\ncertain facts are sufficiently supported in the summary-judgment\n\nrecord.    This turns out to be an important limitation in this\n\ncase, as much (though not all) of the defendants’ argument asks\n\nus to contradict one of the district court’s determinations\n\nregarding the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nB.   Analysis\n\n     1.     Principles\n\n     The Supreme Court formally recognized and described the\n\nEighth Amendment failure-to-protect theory in Farmer v. Brennan:\n\n     [P]rison officials have a duty . . . to protect prisoners\n     from violence at the hands of other prisoners. . . .\n     [G]ratuitously allowing the beating or rape of one\n     prisoner by another serves no legitimate penological\n     objectiv[e], any more than it squares with evolving\n     standards of decency.     Being violently assaulted in\n     prison is simply not part of the penalty that criminal\n     offenders pay for their offenses against society.\n\n\n\n\n                                 30\n\f511 U.S. 825, 833-34 (1994) (second and fifth alterations in\n\noriginal) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).      The\n\nCourt went on to explain that, to succeed on such a claim, “the\n\ninmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing\n\na substantial risk of serious harm” and that the prison officials\n\nacted with “deliberate indifference” to the inmate’s safety.      Id.\n\nat 834.   An official is deliberately indifferent when he “knows\n\nof and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety;\n\nthe official must both be aware of facts from which the inference\n\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\n\nand he must also draw the inference.”    Id. at 837.   The\n\nofficial’s knowledge of the risk can be proven through\n\ncircumstantial evidence, such as by showing that the risk was so\n\nobvious that the official must have known about it.       Id. at 842.\n\nFinally--and significantly for purposes of this case--there is no\n\nliability if the official “responded reasonably to the risk, even\n\nif the harm ultimately was not averted.”    Id. at 844.\n\n     The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity unless\n\ntheir conduct was not only illegal but also violated clearly\n\nestablished law such that their behavior was objectively\n\nunreasonable.   To be “clearly established” for purposes of\n\nqualified immunity, “[t]he contours of the right must be\n\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand\n\nthat what he is doing violates that right.”    Anderson v.\n\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).    The law can be clearly\n\n                                31\n\festablished even without prior cases that are on all fours with\n\nthe present case, “so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable\n\nwarning that the conduct then at issue violated constitutional\n\nrights.”    Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 740 (2002) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      Of course, the defendant’s conduct\n\ncannot constitute a violation of clearly established law if, on\n\nthe plaintiff’s version of the facts, there is no violation at\n\nall.    We therefore initially ask whether the challenged conduct\n\nactually presents a violation of federal law.       See Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001); Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226,\n\n232 (1991).\n\n       With the necessary qualification that we may not in this\n\nappeal review the district court’s conclusions that genuine\n\nissues of fact remain, see supra Part III.A, we exercise de novo\n\nreview over the district court’s legal ruling that, on the set of\n\nfacts that it assumed, the defendants are not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.       See Lemoine v. New Horizons Ranch & Ctr.,\n\nInc., 174 F.3d 629, 634 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n       2.   Application\n\n       Most of the defendants’ brief in No. 03-10455 is devoted to\n\nshowing that Johnson “failed to create a fact question over\n\nwhether any [defendant’s] conduct violated Johnson’s\n\nconstitutional rights or whether any [defendant’s] conduct was\n\nobjectively unreasonable.”      In particular, they repeatedly seek\n\nto demonstrate that, based on the information before them when\n\n                                    32\n\fthey acted, either they did not realize the danger Johnson faced\n\nor they had reason to disbelieve Johnson’s complaints of repeated\n\nrape and abuse.    See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844 (explaining that\n\nprison officials can try to prove that they “did not know of the\n\nunderlying facts” or “believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk\n\n. . . was insubstantial or nonexistent”).   That particular\n\nargument, whether sound or not, is beyond the purview of this\n\nappeal.    The Supreme Court expressly stated in Farmer that\n\n“[w]hether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a\n\nsubstantial risk is a question of fact.”    Id. at 842 (emphasis\n\nadded).    The district court’s April 9 order, while less detailed\n\nthan ideal, clearly stated that there remained a fact question as\n\nto the defendants’ knowledge: “Whether any Defendant had the\n\nrequisite knowledge of a substantial risk of harm is a question\n\nof material fact that [this] Court cannot resolve on the current\n\nrecord.”   As explained earlier, we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nthe district court’s assessment that a genuine issue of fact\n\nexists as to some matter, and therefore we cannot look behind the\n\nruling that Johnson presented sufficient evidence for a fact-\n\nfinder to conclude that the defendants knew of the risk.       See\n\nSmith v. Brenoettsy, 158 F.3d 908, 913 (5th Cir. 1998)\n\n(dismissing an interlocutory appeal where there was a factual\n\ndispute regarding whether defendant prison officials were aware\n\nof the danger to the inmate’s safety).   Accordingly, we must\n\nreject this aspect of the defendants’ argument on appeal.\n\n                                 33\n\f     Nonetheless, our inability to second-guess the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that there existed a fact issue regarding the\n\ndefendants’ awareness of the risk does not end our inquiry.\n\nUnder Farmer, prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment only\n\nif they are both aware of a substantial risk to inmate safety and\n\nfail to respond properly.    The Farmer Court emphasized that there\n\nis no Eighth Amendment violation if the official “responded\n\nreasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not\n\naverted.”   511 U.S. at 844.   Although the district court’s\n\nopinion in this case clearly stated that there were fact issues\n\nregarding the defendants’ knowledge of the risk, the opinion did\n\nnot directly address the material fact issues (if any) that\n\nexisted with respect to how the defendants responded to the risk.\n\nWhen the district court fails to set forth carefully the factual\n\ndisputes that preclude summary judgment, the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that “a court of appeals may have to undertake a\n\ncumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the\n\ndistrict court, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, likely assumed.”     Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319.    Even assuming\n\nthat all of the defendants knew of the substantial risk to\n\nJohnson’s safety, there would be no Eighth Amendment violation if\n\nthe undisputed facts in the record demonstrated that they\n\nresponded reasonably.   Moreover, they would be entitled to\n\nqualified immunity unless clearly established law showed that\n\ntheir response was insufficient.       Accordingly, we must consider\n\n                                  34\n\fwhether some of the defendants might be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on those grounds.\n\n       Non-UCC defendants.   We concluded above that all claims\n\nagainst non-UCC defendants Paul and Willingham were unexhausted.\n\nWe pretermitted deciding the exhaustion issue as regards\n\nExecutive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright in favor of ruling\n\non qualified immunity, to which we now turn.    In addition to\n\ndischarging their usual duties of overseeing and reviewing those\n\nprison operations for which they were responsible, these\n\nsupervisory officials had notice of Johnson’s plight through\n\nvarious letters and life-endangerment forms.    Like all prison\n\nofficials, these supervisory defendants have a duty to take\n\nreasonable measures to protect inmates.     See Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n832.    Yet given the size of the operation that they oversee, they\n\ncannot be expected to intervene personally in response to every\n\ninmate letter they receive.    The record in this case shows that\n\nthey responded to Johnson’s complaints by referring the matter\n\nfor further investigation or taking similar administrative steps.\n\nThis was a reasonable discharge of their duty to protect the\n\ninmates in their care.    Given that neither the Supreme Court nor\n\nthis court has delineated the contours of what supervisory\n\nofficials must do on pain of personal liability, their conduct\n\ndid not violate clearly established law of which reasonable\n\nofficers should have known.    Therefore, they are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                  35\n\f      UCC defendants.   We held in Part II that Johnson had not\n\nexhausted some of his claims arising from certain UCC meetings\n\nbut that he had exhausted claims relating to the September 2001,\n\nDecember 2001, and January 2002 UCC meetings (in addition to the\n\nMarch 2001 meeting, which the defendants concede was exhausted).\n\nWe now consider whether the defendants involved in those meetings\n\nare nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n     Certain UCCs responded to Johnson’s claims by taking action\n\nsuch as ordering further investigation or separating Johnson from\n\na particular inmate who had been threatening him.    Those\n\nresponses were unavailing, but they may well have been reasonable\n\nmethods of addressing the risk that Johnson faced.    See id. at\n\n844 (observing that officials are not liable if they take\n\nreasonable measures, “even if the harm ultimately was not\n\naverted”).   The most diligent prison administrators cannot\n\nguarantee complete safety.   But unlike the UCCs that at least\n\ntook some (unsuccessful) measures to protect Johnson, the\n\nparticular UCC committees that we are now considering--March\n\n2001, September 2001, December 2001, and January 2002--did\n\nnothing in response to Johnson’s claims except (according to\n\nJohnson) tell him to fight off his attackers, despite the\n\ncommittee members’ awareness (which awareness we must assume in\n\nthis appeal) of the substantial risk that Johnson faced.\n\nAlthough it is not clear exactly what type of action an official\n\nis legally required to take under Farmer, the Supreme Court’s\n\n                                36\n\fopinion does make it abundantly clear that an official may not\n\nsimply send the inmate into the general population to fight off\n\nattackers.   See id. at 832-33 (explaining that jailers must “take\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates” and\n\n“are not free to let the state of nature take its course”\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).   (And Farmer\n\nitself is factually similar to today’s case in that it involved\n\nan effeminate prisoner who was raped after he was put in the\n\ngeneral prison population.   Id. at 829-30.)   The defendants, at\n\nleast according to Johnson, repeatedly expressed the view that\n\nJohnson must “learn to f*** or fight,” which runs directly\n\ncounter to Farmer’s directive.   Given the facts that we must\n\nassume for purposes of this appeal, this was not a reasonable\n\nresponse and it indeed contravenes clearly established law.\n\nMoreover, although the defendants contend that no single person\n\nacting alone could have granted Johnson’s requests--the UCC makes\n\nrecommendations to the state classification authority by majority\n\nvote of its three members, so nobody in particular is\n\nresponsible, they say--that does not transform this deliberately\n\nindifferent failure to take any action into a reasonable method\n\nof discharging their duty to protect the prisoners in their care.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity to Wathen and Kuyava as regards the March 16, 2001 UCC;\n\nWathen as regards the September 5, 2001 UCC; Bowman, Kuyava, and\n\nRanjel as regards the December 13, 2001 UCC; and Norwood, Vitolo,\n\n                                 37\n\fand Taylor as regards the January 17, 2002 UCC.16\n\n                    IV. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMS\n\n     Johnson relinquished Equal Protection claims against\n\nExecutive Director Johnson, Treon, Wright, Mooneyham, Willingham,\n\nand Paul.   After further subtracting claims that we deemed\n\nunexhausted in Part II, we are left with Johnson’s claims for\n\nfailure to protect because of sexual orientation against the\n\nparticipants in the March 2001, September 2001, December 2001,\n\nand January 2002 UCCs.\n\nA.   Appellate jurisdiction\n\n     Johnson has also filed a motion to dismiss No. 03-10505, the\n\ndefendants’ appeal from the district court’s denial of judgment\n\non the pleadings.   The defendants moved for judgment on the\n\npleadings in November 2002 and, while that motion was still\n\npending, moved for summary judgment in January 2003.   The first\n\nmotion largely involved Equal Protection claims, while the second\n\naddressed Eighth Amendment claims.   The district court denied the\n\nmotion for summary judgment in April 2003 and, a week later,\n\ndenied the motion for judgment on the pleadings.    The defendants\n\ntimely filed a notice of appeal regarding the denial of summary\n\n\n     16\n          We observe as well that Johnson appeared before a UCC\nin April 2002. It is not clear whether Johnson is pursuing\nclaims related to this meeting, at which Johnson was transferred\nto a different prison. Defendant Wathen was a member of this\ncommittee. If Johnson does mean to pursue such claims, we would\nhold that Wathen’s response was a reasonable one and that the\nimmunity defense should be upheld.\n\n                                38\n\fjudgment and later timely filed a notice of appeal regarding the\n\ndenial of judgment on the pleadings.   Johnson argues that, under\n\nthe circumstances of this case, the second-filed appeal does not\n\nqualify as an appealable decision under the collateral order\n\ndoctrine.\n\n     Johnson acknowledges that, as a general matter, rulings\n\ndenying qualified immunity--whether the ruling occurs at the\n\npleadings stage or at summary judgment--are immediately\n\nappealable under the collateral order doctrine’s exception to the\n\nfinal-judgment rule.   Moreover, Johnson recognizes that the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Behrens generally permits a public\n\nofficial to bring multiple qualified-immunity-based interlocutory\n\nappeals in the course of a single case.   See 516 U.S. at 306-07\n\n(permitting a public official to bring an interlocutory appeal of\n\nthe denial of his motion for summary judgment after the court of\n\nappeals had already affirmed and remanded on a previous\n\ninterlocutory appeal of the denial of his motion to dismiss).\n\nNonetheless, Johnson argues that those general principles are\n\ninapplicable to the unusual circumstances of this case.    A motion\n\nto dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings on qualified immunity\n\ngrounds is in the usual case immediately appealable, Johnson\n\nreasons, only because the public official would otherwise lose\n\nhis entitlement to be free from discovery; an appeal would do no\n\ngood if it came only after the official had already been\n\nsubjected to discovery during summary-judgment proceedings.    But\n\n                                39\n\fin this case, Johnson points out, (some) discovery has already\n\noccurred and the case has moved to the summary-judgment stage.\n\nThe justification for the immediate appeal of the motion to\n\ndismiss is therefore lacking in this case, he contends.\n\n     We conclude that Johnson’s motion is not well-taken.    The\n\nSupreme Court has announced the general rule that orders denying\n\nqualified immunity are treated as “final” and appealable, and we\n\nthink it improper to carve out an exception that responds to the\n\nprecise timing of the district court’s rulings.    The defendants’\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings on the Equal Protection\n\nclaims effectively asserted an immunity from discovery, from\n\nsuit, and from liability.   That some discovery did take place as\n\nthe proceedings moved into the summary-judgment stage does not\n\nmake the court’s denial of the motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings any less conclusive as regards the motion’s request for\n\nimmunity from trial and from liability.    See Behrens, 516 U.S. at\n\n306-09; Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526-28; cf. Matherne v. Wilson, 851\n\nF.2d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 1988) (holding that an official who\n\nfailed to bring any interlocutory appeal could raise qualified\n\nimmunity in a post-verdict appeal of the final judgment, even\n\nthough the only aspect of his immunity that could still be\n\nvindicated at that stage was immunity from liability).\n\n     It also bears noting that the reason for the unusual course\n\nof proceedings cannot be attributed to any improper conduct or\n\nneglect on the part of the defendants.    They properly filed a\n\n                                40\n\fmotion for judgment on the pleadings that largely concerned the\n\nplaintiff’s Equal Protection claims.    While waiting for a ruling,\n\nthe defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment, which\n\nmostly involved the plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claims.    There\n\nwas nothing improper about how the defendants proceeded.    The\n\ndistrict court ruled first on the motion for summary judgment and\n\nlater concluded (perhaps erroneously) that the earlier motion was\n\ntherefore moot.   Either motion would, by itself, ordinarily\n\nsupport an interlocutory appeal.     This case presents no reason to\n\nmuddle the otherwise clear right of a public official to bring an\n\ninterlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified immunity.17    We\n\nwill therefore consider the merits of the appeal.\n\nB.   Analysis\n\n     The district court’s denial of the defendants’ Rule 12(c)\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings is reviewed de novo.      Great\n\nPlains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 313 F.3d\n\n305, 312 (5th Cir. 2002).   The standard for dismissal under Rule\n\n\n     17\n          An instructive contrast with today’s case is presented\nby Armstrong v. Texas State Board of Barber Examiners, 30 F.3d\n643 (5th Cir. 1994). There, the defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment simply repeated the same pleadings-based arguments that\nthe defendant had earlier raised in an unsuccessful motion to\ndismiss, which the defendant did not appeal. The panel concluded\nthat the defendant was merely trying to circumvent the long-\nelapsed deadline for filing an appeal of the denial of the motion\nto dismiss, and it dismissed the appeal. Id. at 644. In today’s\ncase, by contrast, the defendants’ two motions rely on somewhat\ndifferent grounds. Further, both appeals were timely filed, so\nit cannot be said that the defendants are trying to evade any\ndeadline.\n\n                                41\n\f12(c) is the same as that for dismissal for failure to state a\n\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6).     Id. at 313 n.8.    We accept the\n\ncomplaint’s well-pleaded facts as true and view them in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.       Id. at 312-13.   The motion to\n\ndismiss should not be granted unless the plaintiff would not be\n\nentitled to relief under any set of facts that he could prove\n\nconsistent with the complaint.     Id. at 313.\n\n     At the outset, there is some dispute regarding whether\n\nJohnson’s complaint should be measured against a heightened\n\npleading standard rather than the normal Rule 8(a) standard,\n\nwhich requires only a “short and plain statement of the claim.”\n\nIn our decision in Schultea v. Wood, 47 F.3d 1427 (5th Cir. 1995)\n\n(en banc), this court modified our prior practice of requiring\n\nheightened, detail-oriented pleading in § 1983 cases against\n\npublic officials.     After Schultea, a plaintiff no longer needs to\n\n“anticipate the [qualified immunity] defense in his complaint at\n\nthe risk of dismissal under Rule 12.”       Id. at 1430.18   The\n\nconsiderations that had led to the adoption of heightened\n\npleading would henceforth be satisfied, the court held, through\n\nthe device of a detailed Rule 7 reply, which the district court\n\ncould order on the defendant’s motion or sua sponte.         Id. at\n\n1433.     No such Rule 7 reply was requested or ordered in this\n\n\n     18\n          Schultea nonetheless cautioned that, in making his\n“short and plain statement of his complaint” under Rule 8, the\nplaintiff may not rest on “conclusions alone.” 47 F.3d at 1433.\n\n                                  42\n\fcase, and the defendants have not appealed the district court’s\n\ndecision not to require one.    As we have observed already,\n\nJohnson’s complaint is quite detailed and factually explicit, and\n\nthe defendants’ answer was in the nature of a blanket denial.\n\n     Notwithstanding that there was no Rule 7 reply, the\n\ndefendants contend that the standards for Rule 7 replies should\n\ngovern instead of the rules characteristic of notice-pleading\n\nunder Rule 8(a).   Their reasoning is that the local rules for the\n\nNorthern District of Texas disfavor motions for a more definite\n\nstatement and that, according to their own knowledge and their\n\nconversations with court personnel, motions for a Rule 7 reply\n\nare treated the same way.    Johnson aptly responds to the\n\ndefendants’ contentions by citing cases in which courts in the\n\nNorthern District have granted motions requesting Rule 7 replies.\n\nIf the district court were flouting Schultea--which we presume\n\nour district courts would not do--the defendants should have\n\nfiled a motion for a Rule 7 reply and appealed its denial.     As\n\nthey did not, we will apply the ordinary rules that govern the\n\nsufficiency of complaints.\n\n     2.   Whether the complaint adequately stated a claim\n\n     Turning to the sufficiency of the complaint, the defendants\n\nmake three arguments in support of their view that Johnson’s\n\npleadings failed to allege any Equal Protection violations.     If\n\nJohnson has indeed failed to allege a violation, then of course\n\nthere can be no violation of clearly established law that would\n\n                                 43\n\fovercome qualified immunity.   See Siegert, 500 U.S. at 232.    We\n\nconsider each of the defendants’ criticisms of the complaint in\n\nturn.\n\n     First, the defendants argue that Johnson’s pleadings fail\n\nbecause he did not allege that the prison officials’\n\nclassification decisions were not rationally related to any\n\nlegitimate penological interest.     It is important to point out\n\nthat the defendants themselves have not attempted to articulate\n\nany legitimate interests that could justify giving less\n\nprotection to homosexual inmates.     Rather, their position in this\n\ncase has consistently been that they did not in fact act on that\n\nbasis.   Nonetheless, they contend that there is a pleading\n\nrequirement that the plaintiff must allege in his complaint the\n\nlack of any rational relationship to a legitimate penological\n\ninterest.   Although they are correct that the prisoner, not the\n\nstate, bears the burden of proving that a challenged policy is\n\ninvalid because it does not bear a rational relationship to\n\nlegitimate objectives, Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132\n\n(2003), that does not necessarily mean that the prisoner’s\n\ncomplaint must allege the absence of such a relationship on pain\n\nof dismissal.   Cf. Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987)\n\n(stating that “there must be a valid, rational connection between\n\nthe prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest\n\nput forward to justify it” (internal quotation marks omitted and\n\nemphasis added)).   In any event, Johnson’s complaint does include\n\n                                44\n\fstatements that the defendants subjected him to “an arbitrary and\n\nirrational classification” and acted out of “hostility and\n\nanimus.”   If a plaintiff’s complaint must deny any rational\n\nrelationship to legitimate penological aims even when those aims\n\nhave not been articulated, Johnson’s complaint satisfies the\n\nrequirement.\n\n     Second, the defendants contend that, as mere comments alone\n\ndo not violate the Equal Protection Clause, Johnson has not\n\nalleged that he has suffered any actionable discriminatory\n\ntreatment.   This argument misconstrues the nature of Johnson’s\n\nclaim.   He does not contend that the comments made by certain\n\ndefendants are themselves actionable.   Rather, his complaint\n\nrepeatedly alleges that he was denied protection because of his\n\nsexual orientation; the comments are relevant because they tend\n\nto reveal the defendants’ reasons for their actions in denying\n\nhim safekeeping.   See Williams v. Bramer, 180 F.3d 699, 706 (5th\n\nCir. 1999) (explaining that while an official’s use of racial\n\nepithets “without harassment or some other conduct that deprives\n\nthe victim of established rights . . . does not amount to an\n\nequal protection violation,” the use of epithets is “strong\n\nevidence” that the official’s actions are racially motivated).\n\n     Third, the defendants argue that the complaint fails to\n\nidentify any non-homosexual prisoners who were similarly situated\n\nbut were treated better.   This argument is unavailing for several\n\nreasons.   Johnson’s complaint did contain general allegations to\n\n                                45\n\fthe effect that he qualified for safekeeping status but was\n\ntreated differently than other vulnerable inmates because of his\n\nsexual orientation.   He alleged, for instance, that the\n\ndefendants “treated him differently than other similarly situated\n\ninmates based on their hostility and animus towards non-\n\naggressive gay men.”19   It is unclear how a prisoner is supposed\n\nto possess identifying information regarding other inmates’\n\ntreatment at the complaint stage.     But, in any event, evidence of\n\nthe type the defendants request is not essential to the claim.\n\nIn most cases, a plaintiff lacks direct evidence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, and he therefore will try to rely on evidence\n\nthat two groups received different treatment, which can support\n\nan inference that the decisionmaker purposefully engaged in\n\ndiscrimination.   But those kinds of inference-producing\n\ncomparisons are unnecessary where the § 1983 plaintiff has direct\n\nevidence of discriminatory motive.     See Wallace v. Tex. Tech\n\nUniv., 80 F.3d 1042, 1047-48 (5th Cir. 1996).     Indeed, Johnson’s\n\n\n     19\n            The defendants at one point assert that “[a]ll of\nPlaintiff’s allegations regarding equal protection are made on\n‘information and belief,’” and they argue that such allegations\nare improper. It is inaccurate to say that “all” of the\nallegations are so phrased. The only “information and belief”\nallegations related to this subject are a few that concern\nwhether the defendants have a “custom and practice” of denying\nsafekeeping to vulnerable black and homosexual inmates. Further,\n“information and belief” pleadings are generally deemed\npermissible under the Federal Rules, especially in cases in which\nthe information is more accessible to the defendant. See 5\nCHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE\n§ 1224 (2d ed. 1990).\n\n                                 46\n\fcomplaint contains detailed allegations that, if true, would\n\nconstitute direct evidence that the defendants treated Johnson\n\ndifferently in making their decisions and did so because of his\n\nstatus.20   Leaving aside the question whether identifying\n\ninformation about other inmates would even be available to a\n\nplaintiff at the pleading stage, we do not believe that a\n\nplaintiff’s complaint must plead the circumstantial case that the\n\ndefendants are requesting.   Cf. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534\n\nU.S. 506, 511-12 (2002) (holding that a Title VII plaintiff need\n\nnot plead facts showing a prima facie case of discrimination\n\nunder McDonnell Douglas and remarking that it would be\n\n“incongruous to require a plaintiff, in order to survive a motion\n\nto dismiss, to plead more facts than he may ultimately need to\n\n\n\n\n     20\n          Direct evidence includes statements revealing that an\nimproper criterion--here sexual orientation--played a part in the\ndecisionmaking process. See Fabela v. Socorro Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n329 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir. 2003); see also Propst v. Leapley,\n886 F.2d 1068, 1071 (8th Cir. 1989) (describing prison official’s\nstatement that disciplinary committee is “inclined to be more\nlenient to blacks” as “highly probative” direct evidence of\nintentional discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause). Johnson’s complaint alleges that various defendants\nmade remarks that reveal that they acted on improper criteria\nwhen they denied him safekeeping status. See, e.g., Complaint at\n¶ 33 (“We don’t protect punks on this farm.”), ¶ 55 (“There is no\nreason why Black punks can’t fight and survive in general\npopulation if they don’t want to f***.”), ¶ 86 (“You like this\n. . . . I don’t think you need no safekeeping.”).\n\n\n                                 47\n\fprove to succeed on the merits if direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination is discovered.”).21\n\n     3.   Clearly established law\n\n     The defendants contend that the law is not clearly\n\nestablished regarding (as they phrase the question presented in\n\nthis case) “whether the use of race or sexual orientation as a\n\nfactor in state prison classification decisions violates the\n\n     21\n          The defendants address Johnson’s Equal Protection\nclaims primarily in their brief in No. 03-10505, the appeal from\nthe denial of the motion for judgment on the pleadings.\nNaturally, the arguments in that brief--which we have been\naddressing in this part of the opinion--concern only Johnson’s\npleadings, not his summary-judgment evidence. At the end of\ntheir brief in No. 03-10455, the separate appeal from the denial\nof the motion for summary judgment, which mostly pertains to the\nEighth Amendment, the defendants incorporate by reference the\npleadings-based Equal Protection arguments from the other brief.\nThe defendants’ brief in No. 03-10455 then purports to argue, in\na few sentences without any citations to authorities or the\nrecord, that Johnson has also failed to provide sufficient\nevidence to survive summary judgment on his Equal Protection\nclaims. This briefing on the evidentiary support for the Equal\nProtection claims (as opposed to the adequacy of the pleadings)\nis likely inadequate to present the issue. See L & A Contracting\nCo. v. S. Concrete Servs., Inc., 17 F.3d 106, 113 (5th Cir.\n1994). In any event, the result would not differ if summary-\njudgment standards were applied to the Equal Protection claims.\nJohnson’s affidavit recounts the same inflammatory statements\nalleged in his complaint, which constitute direct evidence. The\ndefendants point out that a couple of the defendants--including\nVitolo, a defendant at issue here--did not make such comments.\nYet Johnson’s affidavit says that Vitolo laughed during the\nmeeting when one of the other UCC members said that Johnson did\nnot need protection from rape because he liked having sex with\nmen. Further, Johnson had filed a motion to compel disclosure of\nstatistics on safekeeping that might provide the circumstantial\nevidence of intentional discrimination that the defendants fault\nhim for not employing. Johnson’s response to the motion for\nsummary judgment included a Rule 56(f) affidavit that alerted the\ndistrict court to the pendency of his request for this\ninformation.\n\n                                48\n\fEqual Protection Clause, when the use is rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate penological interest.”   No Supreme Court or Fifth\n\nCircuit case, they say, has considered the extent to which sexual\n\norientation can be considered in housing classifications.\n\n     The defendants’ manner of phrasing the issue is inapt.\n\nFirst, while it is somewhat uncertain to what extent sexual\n\norientation can legitimately be taken into account in fashioning\n\nprison housing policies,22 the defendants in this case deny that\n\nthey took Johnson’s race and orientation into account.   That is,\n\nthey do not say that such status-based decisionmaking would be\n\njustified because of legitimate countervailing penological aims--\n\nas they would need to say in a case involving a policy of housing\n\nall black or all homosexual inmates together--but rather they say\n\nthat they made their decisions based on a status-neutral\n\ndetermination that Johnson was not unusually vulnerable.\n\n     Second, if they actually did deny Johnson protection because\n\nof his homosexuality, as Johnson alleges and as we must assume\n\nfor purposes of analysis, that decision would certainly not\n\neffectuate any legitimate interest.   See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833\n\n(“[G]ratuitously allowing the beating or rape of one prisoner by\n\nanother serves no legitimate penological objectiv[e].” (second\n\n     22\n          We observe that the Supreme Court has granted\ncertiorari to decide whether a prison’s policy of segregating\nincoming prisoners by race for a period of sixty days violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause. See Johnson v. California, 321 F.3d\n791 (9th Cir. 2003), cert. granted, 124 S. Ct. 1505 (Mar. 1,\n2004).\n\n                               49\n\falteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)).   It\n\nis clearly established that all prison inmates are entitled to\n\nreasonable protection from sexual assault.   See id. at 832-34.\n\n(As it happens, the abused inmate in Farmer was a feminine-\n\nlooking preoperative male-to-female transsexual.)   Neither the\n\nSupreme Court nor this court has recognized sexual orientation as\n\na suspect classification [or protected group]; nevertheless, a\n\nstate violates the Equal Protection Clause if it disadvantages\n\nhomosexuals for reasons lacking any rational relationship to\n\nlegitimate governmental aims.   Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631-\n\n32 (1996).   The defendants have not attempted to argue that\n\naccording homosexuals less protection than other inmates would\n\nadvance any legitimate aim.   Thus, we conclude that Johnson has\n\nalleged conduct that would be unreasonable in light of law that\n\nwas clearly established at the time of the alleged events.\n\n                           V. CONCLUSION\n\n     Johnson’s motions to dismiss Nos. 03-10455 and 03-10505 are\n\nDENIED.   We REVERSE the district court’s judgment to the extent\n\nthat it concluded that Johnson had exhausted: race-based Equal\n\nProtection claims; claims against defendants Paul and Willingham;\n\nclaims against Bright and Kuyava as regards the September 6, 2000\n\nUCC; claims against Mooneyham and Vitolo as regards the December\n\n13, 2000 UCC; claims against Bowman, Boyle, and Kuyava as regards\n\nthe February 14, 2001 UCC; and claims against Vitolo and Wathen\n\n\n\n                                50\n\fas regards the February 21, 2001 UCC.     See supra Part II.D.\n\nTurning to the exhausted claims, we also REVERSE the district\n\ncourt’s judgment to the extent that it denied qualified immunity\n\nto Executive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright.    The district\n\ncourt’s judgment is otherwise AFFIRMED.    The case is REMANDED to\n\nthe district court, for dismissal of the claims listed above and\n\nfor further proceedings on the remaining claims.\n\n     Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\nMOTIONS DENIED; AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                               51\n\f",

According to the plaintiff’s\n\fversion of events, which is disputed by the defendants, he\n\nsuffered through a horrific eighteen-month period of\n\nincarceration during which the defendant prison officials failed\n\nto protect him from prison gangs who repeatedly raped him and\n\nbought and sold him as a sexual slave.   His complaint asserted\n\nviolations of the Eighth Amendment and the Equal Protection\n\nClause.   The district court denied the defendants’ motions for\n\njudgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment, and they now\n\nbring these interlocutory appeals.    The defendants argue that the\n\nplaintiff largely failed to exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nand that any exhausted claims are barred by qualified immunity.\n\nWe conclude that the majority, but not all, of the plaintiff’s\n\nclaims must be dismissed on grounds of failure to exhaust or\n\nqualified immunity.   We therefore affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand.\n\n                       I. GENERAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Roderick Johnson entered the Texas prison system in January\n\n2000 after the revocation of a sentence of probation that he had\n\nreceived for a nonviolent burglary.   He was transferred to the\n\nsystem’s Allred Unit on September 6, 2000.     Upon arriving at\n\nAllred, Johnson met with a three-person Unit Classification\n\nCommittee (UCC) for a determination of his initial housing\n\nstatus.   Prison officials knew that Johnson was homosexual and\n\npossessed an effeminate manner.   Johnson told the UCC that he had\n\n\n\n                                  2\n\fbeen housed in “safekeeping” before his transfer.1   Safekeeping\n\nis a housing status that separates vulnerable individuals from\n\nmore aggressive offenders.   According to Texas Department of\n\nCriminal Justice (TDCJ) regulations, safekeeping is indicated\n\nwhen an inmate is at risk of victimization, has enemies in the\n\npopulation, has a history of homosexuality, or possesses other\n\ncharacteristics that mark the offender as vulnerable to\n\npredation.   But according to Johnson, one of the members of the\n\nUCC told him that “[w]e don’t protect punks on this farm”--“punk”\n\nbeing prison slang for a homosexual man.   Johnson was put in the\n\ngeneral population.   He was raped by other inmates almost\n\nimmediately.\n\n     Johnson’s complaint and affidavit describe a horrific series\n\nof events that allegedly occurred over the next eighteen months\n\nat Allred.   In October 2000, not long after his arrival in the\n\ngeneral population, a prison gang member named Hernandez asserted\n\n“ownership” over Johnson, forcing Johnson to become his sexual\n\nservant.   Johnson informed Assistant Warden Mooneyham and\n\nSergeant Willingham of the rapes and requested medical attention,\n\n\n     1\n          The parties’ briefs take apparently conflicting\npositions on whether Johnson was housed in safekeeping before his\ntransfer. Johnson’s brief says that “he had been housed in\nsafekeeping just before he was transferred to Allred Unit.” But\nthe defendants say that “Johnson was not classified ‘safekeeping’\nprior to the his arrival at the Allred Unit.” It appears that\nboth sides are technically correct: Johnson was housed in\ntransient safekeeping shortly before his transfer, but he was not\nofficially classified to that status.\n\n                                 3\n\fbut they told him that care was available only for emergencies\n\nand that he should file a written request for medical attention.\n\nBy November, Hernandez began to rent Johnson out to perform\n\ncoerced sexual favors for other inmates.   Johnson believed that\n\nhe would be severely beaten or killed if he refused.   Hernandez\n\nbeat Johnson on November 30, and medical personnel documented\n\nbruising and swelling on Johnson’s face.   At several times over\n\nthe following months, Johnson was moved to different buildings at\n\nAllred and was raped and owned by different prison gangs.\n\n     Johnson sought help from guards, filed numerous “life-\n\nendangerment” forms, and wrote letters to prison administrators.\n\nPrison officers who investigated Johnson’s complaints generally\n\ndetermined that they could not be corroborated; the officers\n\nusually did not interview any of the inmates mentioned in\n\nJohnson’s complaints, purportedly out of a concern to protect the\n\n“integrity of the investigation” or to protect Johnson.\n\nJohnson’s life-endangerment forms triggered a number of\n\nappearances before UCCs composed of various prison officials and\n\nemployees.   Johnson asked the UCCs to place him in safekeeping\n\nstatus, place him in protective custody (which entails a\n\nsignificant loss of privileges), or transfer him to a different\n\nprison on multiple occasions: December 13, 2000; February 14,\n\n2001; February 21, 2001; March 16, 2001; September 5, 2001;\n\nDecember 13, 2001; and January 17, 2002.   Each time the committee\n\nrefused Johnson’s requests, ostensibly because there was no\n\n                                 4\n\fconcrete evidence of victimization.    According to Johnson, the\n\nmembers of the committees repeatedly told him that he either had\n\nto fight off his attackers or submit to being used for sex.    The\n\ncomments allegedly made by the UCC members, which they dispute,\n\ninclude statements such as: “You need to get down there and fight\n\nor get you a man,” “There’s no reason why Black punks can’t fight\n\nand survive in general population if they don’t want to f***,”\n\nand remarks to the effect that, since Johnson was homosexual, he\n\nprobably liked the sexual assaults he was experiencing.\n\n     In addition to writing letters to administrators and filing\n\nlife-endangerment notices, Johnson also used the TDCJ’s formal\n\ntwo-step administrative grievance process on several occasions.\n\nThe grievances described his victimization and his repeated\n\nunsuccessful requests for protection or a transfer to\n\nsafekeeping.    The grievances were denied, generally on the basis\n\nthat unit officials or UCC committees had already conducted\n\nproper investigations and had found no substantiating evidence.2\n\n     Johnson eventually contacted the American Civil Liberties\n\nUnion.    Shortly thereafter, Johnson went before the UCC again, on\n\nApril 1, 2002, and was approved for a transfer to TDCJ’s Michael\n\nUnit.    During his December 2002 deposition, Johnson testified\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Additional details regarding Johnson’s grievances are\nprovided later, in conjunction with our analysis of the\nexhaustion issue.\n\n                                  5\n\fthat he had not suffered attacks at the Michael Unit, where he\n\nwas housed in safekeeping.\n\n     Johnson filed suit in the district court in April 2002\n\nagainst over a dozen TDCJ officials and employees.       The\n\ndefendants comprise supervisory officials such as TDCJ Executive\n\nDirector Gary Johnson,3 Senior Warden Treon, Assistant Warden\n\nWathen, Assistant Warden Mooneyham, and Director of\n\nClassification Wright; guards who failed to protect Johnson on\n\ndiscrete occasions (namely, Lieutenant Paul4 and Sergeant\n\nWillingham); and many of the members of the various UCCs that had\n\ndenied Johnson protection (namely, Major Norwood, Major Bright,\n\nUCC Administrative Technician Kuyava, UCC Administrative\n\nTechnician Vitolo, Captain Boyle, Major Bowman, Lieutenant\n\nRanjel, and Lieutenant Taylor).5       The lengthy complaint asserted\n\nthree causes of action: (1) failure to protect Johnson from harm,\n\nin violation of the Eighth Amendment, (2) a race-based Equal\n\n\n\n     3\n          This defendant is referred to in this opinion as\n“Executive Director Johnson.” The name “Johnson” refers to the\nplaintiff, Roderick Johnson.\n     4\n          The incident involving Paul occurred in March 2002.\nAccording to Johnson, a group of inmates molested him and a\nmentally ill inmate in the showers. Afterward, Johnson told\nPaul, who offered no assistance and instead made menacing\ncomments to Johnson.\n     5\n          There is some overlap among these general categories of\ndefendants. For instance, Wathen sometimes sat on the UCC;\nMooneyham sat once on the UCC and (with Willingham) was involved\nin the October 2000 incident described earlier, in addition to\ncarrying out his supervisory responsibilities.\n\n                                   6\n\fProtection claim charging that officials denied him protection\n\nbecause he is black, and (3) a sexual-orientation-based Equal\n\nProtection claim predicated on the allegation that the defendants\n\ndenied Johnson protection out of anti-homosexual animus.   The\n\nsuit sought injunctive relief and damages.   The defendants\n\nanswered Johnson’s complaint with a blanket denial of almost all\n\nof its allegations.\n\n     In July 2002, Executive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright\n\nmoved for judgment on the pleadings on Johnson’s Equal Protection\n\nclaims (but not the Eighth Amendment claim).   The plaintiff did\n\nnot oppose this motion, and the district court later granted it.\n\n     In November 2002, all of the defendants filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,\n\nand, at the same time, all of the defendants who were still\n\nfacing Equal Protection claims (i.e., all defendants but\n\nExecutive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright) filed a motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings with regard to the Equal Protection\n\nclaims.6   The motion for judgment on the pleadings asserted,\n\ninter alia, an entitlement to qualified immunity on the ground\n\nthat Johnson had not alleged violations of rights that were\n\nclearly established.\n\n     6\n          At the same time, two of the defendants (Executive\nDirector Johnson and Paul) also sought judgment on the pleadings\nwith regard to Johnson’s Eighth Amendment claim. The other\ndefendants, however, did not challenge the Eighth Amendment\ntheory at the pleadings stage.\n\n\n                                 7\n\f     While those motions were still pending, the defendants also\n\nfiled, in January 2003, a motion for summary judgment on the\n\nEighth Amendment claims, again asserting qualified immunity among\n\nother grounds.   The motion also reasserted the defendants’\n\narguments concerning Johnson’s Equal Protection claims.\n\n     On April 9, 2003, the district court denied the defendants’\n\nJanuary 2003 motion for summary judgment in an order stating that\n\nfact issues remained regarding whether the defendants acted with\n\ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk to Johnson’s\n\nsafety; the court further held that the factual disputes\n\nprecluded a ruling on qualified immunity on the current record.\n\nThe court’s order also rejected the defendants’ exhaustion\n\nargument, which they had re-urged in their motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n     The defendants then requested a ruling on the still-pending\n\nNovember 2002 motion for judgment on the pleadings, which largely\n\nconcerned the Equal Protection claims.   On April 17, 2003, the\n\ncourt denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding\n\nthat Johnson’s pleadings adequately stated a claim.   The order\n\nalso denied as moot the motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust,\n\nas the court’s previous order had rejected that argument.\n\nFinally, the order denied as moot the request for qualified\n\nimmunity, the court having already determined that material fact\n\nissues required trial.\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\f     The defendants filed a notice of appeal from the April 9\n\norder denying summary judgment, and this became appeal No. 03-\n\n10455.    Later, they filed a notice of appeal from the April 17\n\norder denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings--docketed\n\nas appeal No. 03-10505.    Both interlocutory appeals are\n\npredicated on the rule that denials of qualified immunity based\n\non issues of law are immediately appealable under the collateral\n\norder doctrine.    See Mitchell v.

The district court later certified, and this court\n\ngranted leave to pursue, an interlocutory appeal of the district\n\ncourt’s ruling that Johnson had exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies--appeal No. 03-10722.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n     Johnson has filed motions to dismiss Nos. 03-10505 and 03-\n\n10455 for want of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n     On December 19, 2003, Johnson was released from prison into\n\nmandatory supervision at a halfway house.    The defendants have\n\nargued, and the plaintiff conceded at oral argument, that\n\nJohnson’s claims for injunctive relief and his claims against the\n\ndefendants in their official capacities have been rendered moot,\n\nleaving only his claims against the defendants in their\n\nindividual capacities for damages.\n\n                           II. EXHAUSTION\n\n     Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), prisoners are\n\nrequired to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit:\n\n\n\n                                  9\n\f“No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions\n\nunder section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a\n\nprisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional\n\nfacility until such administrative remedies as are available are\n\nexhausted.”   42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2000).   The defendants argue\n\nthat Johnson’s grievances were insufficiently detailed, untimely,\n\nor both, thus failing to exhaust his administrative remedies.     We\n\nreview de novo the district court’s denial of the motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to exhaust.    Richardson v. Spurlock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"25024\"><a href=\"/opinion/25024/richardson-v-spurlock/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n     The Texas prison system has developed a two-step formal\n\ngrievance process.    The Step 1 grievance, which must be filed\n\nwithin fifteen days of the complained-of incident, is handled\n\nwithin the prisoner’s facility.    After an adverse decision at\n\nStep 1, the prisoner has ten days to file a Step 2 grievance,\n\nwhich is handled at the state level.    This court has previously\n\nheld that a prisoner must pursue a grievance through both steps\n\nfor it to be considered exhausted.     See Wright v. Hollingsworth,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24842\"><a href=\"/opinion/24842/wright-v-hollingsworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n     The record in this case includes portions of the guidelines\n\nthat TDCJ provides prisoners regarding how to file grievances.\n\nAmong other things, the rules direct inmates to write “briefly\n\nand clearly” but also to “be very specific about your grievance\n\nor your problem.”    They state that a grievance should contain\n\nfacts, not legal words or conclusions.    They further direct the\n\n                                  10\n\fprisoner to “[t]ell us what action you want us to take to resolve\n\nyour grievance or problem,” but they specifically state that a\n\nprisoner should “not ask us to take disciplinary action against\n\nemployees.”   The guidelines state that an inmate should not\n\n“submit repetitive grievances on the same issue.”   Finally, they\n\nwarn that an inmate is subject to sanctions for abusing the\n\ngrievance process, such as by making “excessive, frivolous and\n\nvexatious use of the procedure.”\n\n     In addition to writing many administrative life-\n\nendangerment notices and letters, Johnson twice filed formal\n\ngrievances on TDCJ-provided standard forms and pursued them\n\nthrough the two-step process just described.    In particular, he\n\nfiled Step 1 grievances on March 18, 2001 and December 30, 2001,\n\nboth times appealing the matter to Step 2 after being denied at\n\nStep 1.    (He filed Step 1 grievances on a few other occasions as\n\nwell, but he did not fully exhaust them by proceeding through\n\nStep 2.)   Johnson’s complaint included an allegation that he had\n\nexhausted available administrative remedies.7\n\n     7\n          Before turning to the substance of the exhaustion\nrequirement, we observe that there is a threshold issue regarding\nwhether the defendants properly raised the exhaustion issue.\nThough the defendants raised exhaustion in their motions for\njudgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment, their answer\nto Johnson’s complaint did not raise the issue. Johnson argues\nthat exhaustion is an affirmative defense and points to the\ngeneral rule, see Giles v. Gen. Elec. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"23584\"><a href=\"/opinion/23584/giles-v-general-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491-92\n(5th Cir. 2001), that affirmative defenses not raised in the\nanswer are ordinarily deemed waived. The defendants contend that\nexhaustion is not an affirmative defense but is instead part of\nthe plaintiff’s cause of action.\n\n                                 11\n\f     Section 1997e(a) does not say how specific a prisoner’s\n\nadministrative grievances must be, and this court has so far\n\ngiven relatively little guidance regarding what a prisoner must\n\nsay in his grievances to exhaust his claims properly.    As a\n\ngeneral matter, courts typically use a standard according to\n\nwhich a grievance should give prison officials “fair notice” of\n\nthe problem that will form the basis of the prisoner’s suit.\n\nSee, e.g., Burton v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781072\"><a href=\"/opinion/781072/ronnie-burton-v-wendee-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\nThe parties agree on that generalized formulation but,\n\n\n     As Johnson accurately points out, the substantial majority\nof courts of appeals that have considered the question hold that\nexhaustion is an affirmative defense, generally reasoning that it\nis similar to a statute-of-limitations defense. See, e.g.,\nCasanova v. Dubois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200126\"><a href=\"/opinion/200126/casanova-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 n.3 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing\ncases).

But,\narguably, these cases have not directly decided the question.\nAssuming arguendo that the question is as-yet undecided, we have\nno occasion to decide it here. While failure to raise an\naffirmative defense in the answer generally results in a waiver,\nnoncompliance can be excused if the defendant raises the issue at\na “pragmatically sufficient” time and there is no prejudice to\nthe plaintiff. See Giles, 245 F.3d at 491-92. The defendants\nraised the exhaustion issue in their motion for judgment on the\npleadings, and here it does not appear that Johnson was surprised\nin any way, as might happen when a party waits until shortly\nbefore trial to raise a new defense. Moreover, failure to plead\nexhaustion in the answer is especially excusable here given that\nthe law on the topic is not clearly settled. See Foulk v.\nCharrier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774623\"><a href=\"/opinion/774623/robert-foulk-v-ronald-charrier-lieutenant-charrier-individually-and-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 697 (8th Cir. 2001) (excusing defendant’s\nfailure to raise exhaustion in a timely manner because circuit\nlaw regarding PLRA exhaustion was unsettled at the time).\n\n                               12\n\funsurprisingly, they differ on how much detail is required in\n\norder to provide notice of the prisoner’s problem.\n\n     In deciding how much detail is required in a given case, we\n\nbelieve that a court must interpret the exhaustion requirement in\n\nlight of its purposes, which include the goal of giving officials\n\n“time and opportunity to address complaints internally,” Porter\n\nv. Nussle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118483\"><a href=\"/opinion/118483/porter-v-nussle/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (2002).   Thus, a grievance should be\n\nconsidered sufficient to the extent that the grievance gives\n\nofficials a fair opportunity to address the problem that will\n\nlater form the basis of the lawsuit.   Further, as a practical\n\nmatter, the amount of information necessary will likely depend to\n\nsome degree on the type of problem about which the inmate is\n\ncomplaining.   If an inmate claims that a guard acted improperly,\n\nwe can assume that the administrators responding to the grievance\n\nwould want to know--and a prisoner could ordinarily be expected\n\nto provide--details regarding who was involved and when the\n\nincident occurred, or at least other available information about\n\nthe incident that would permit an investigation of the matter.\n\nIn contrast, a grievance in which an inmate says that his cell is\n\nhabitually infested with vermin, or that the prices in the\n\ncommissary are too high, could adequately alert administrators to\n\nthe problem whether or not the grievance names anyone.   Compare\n\nCurry v.

Since prisoners are\n\ngenerally required to follow the procedures adopted by the state\n\nprison system, the specificity requirement should be interpreted\n\nin light of the grievance rules of the particular prison system,\n\nhere the TDCJ.   See Strong v. David, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778452\"><a href=\"/opinion/778452/dion-strong-v-alphonso-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 649 (7th Cir.\n\n2002) (“[G]rievances must contain the sort of information that\n\nthe administrative system requires.”).8   Thus, in deciding\n\nwhether the grievance gives officials an opportunity to address\n\nthe problem, we should consider whether the grievance provides\n\nthe type of information that the TDCJ rules request.\n\n     The defendants raise three distinct types of exhaustion\n\narguments on appeal: They argue that Johnson did not exhaust (1)\n\ncertain of his legal theories (2) regarding certain episodes (3)\n\n\n\n     8\n          The Strong opinion qualified its holding by noting that\na state’s procedures would be invalid if they established\nrequirements inconsistent with the federal policies behind § 1983\nand § 1997e(a). 297 F.3d at 649. In other words, a state could\nnot make grievance rules that prevented the vindication of\nsubstantive rights.\n\n                                14\n\fagainst certain defendants.   We consider each in turn, and we\n\nconclude that many of Johnson’s claims are unexhausted.\n\nA.   Which theories?\n\n     Johnson’s suit contains Eighth Amendment claims, race-based\n\nEqual Protection claims, and claims for failure to protect\n\nbecause of sexual orientation under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nWe begin with the question of which of those three categories of\n\nclaims were exhausted.\n\n     As a general matter, there is authority from several courts\n\nto the effect that a prisoner, who is of course typically\n\nuncounseled, need not present legal theories in his grievances.\n\nSee, e.g., Burton, 321 F.3d at 575 (“[W]e would not require a\n\nprisoner’s grievance to allege a specific legal theory or facts\n\nthat correspond to all the required elements of a particular\n\nlegal theory.”); see also Strong, 297 F.3d at 650 (concluding\n\nthat a prisoner need not present legal theories, at least as long\n\nas prison rules do not require that).   We agree.   As we discussed\n\nabove, the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to give\n\nprison administrators an opportunity to address a problem, and\n\nthey can do this whether or not the prisoner tells them the\n\nconstitutional provisions that the problem implicates.    Further,\n\nTDCJ rules specifically instruct inmates to provide facts, not\n\nlegal terminology.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f     Johnson’s grievances repeatedly refer to the defendants’\n\nfailure to protect him from assaults and (though this was\n\nunnecessary) specifically name the Eighth Amendment.    The\n\ndefendants admit that the grievances exhausted Eighth Amendment\n\nclaims, at least against a few defendants regarding a few\n\ninstances--matters that we will discuss later.     They also argue,\n\nhowever, that the grievances do not exhaust any of Johnson’s two\n\ntypes of Equal Protection claims against any defendant.\n\n     Race.   As to race discrimination, the defendants correctly\n\nobserve that Johnson’s grievances nowhere state that he was\n\nsuffering racial discrimination.     Indeed, his grievances do not\n\nmention his race at all.   Even though Johnson need not present a\n\nfull-fledged legal theory in his grievance, his grievances must\n\nalert prison officials to a problem and give them an opportunity\n\nto address it.   His grievances gave them notice that there was a\n\nproblem with protection from sexual assaults, but we do not think\n\nthat they can be read to give notice that there was a race-\n\nrelated problem.   See Medera v. Griffin, No. 02 C 1064, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">132496</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 14, 2003) (holding that grievances\n\nregarding prison conditions that allegedly violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment did not exhaust an Equal Protection claim where the\n\ngrievances contained “no mention whatsoever of the plaintiff’s\n\nheritage, nor any references to racial slurs”).9\n\n     9\n          To be sure, Johnson’s Eighth Amendment and Equal\nProtection claims are not wholly unrelated: His race, he claims,\n\n                                16\n\f     Sexual orientation.    Johnson’s grievances mention his sexual\n\norientation many times.    For the most part, the references to\n\nJohnson’s sexuality are intertwined with Johnson’s complaints\n\nabout the officials’ failure to protect him from assaults.      The\n\ndefendants contend that this does not necessarily indicate that\n\nJohnson was complaining that the officials were purposefully\n\ndiscriminating against him, by refusing to protect him, because\n\nof his homosexuality.    The grievances are certainly not as\n\nexplicit as one would expect from a lawyer, but as we stated\n\nabove a prisoner need not provide all of the elements of a\n\nconstitutional claim as long as the grievance at least reasonably\n\nindicates a problem.    Further, Johnson’s grievances do also\n\nsuggest a complaint that the officials considered Johnson’s\n\nsexuality: Johnson writes that members of the UCC responded to\n\nhis requests for protection from rape by saying “that they feel\n\nthat because I’m a homosexual I’m enticing [illegible].”    In\n\naddition, a reasonable reader could infer that the officials\n\nwould not tell a heterosexual inmate that, instead of getting\n\n\n\nis part of the reason why the defendants failed to protect him.\nCf. Burton, 321 F.3d at 577. Nonetheless, these claims reflect\ndistinct problems with prison staff, and a grievance that\nsuggested a racial component to Johnson’s situation could be\nexpected to produce a different type of administrative response.\nCf. Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 (explaining that one purpose of the\nexhaustion requirement is the creation of an “administrative\nrecord that clarifies the contours of the controversy”).   We do\nnot believe that it is too much to ask that a prisoner at least\nsuggest a racial component if he is later going to sue on that\nground.\n\n                                 17\n\fprotection from victimization, he should “choose someone to be\n\nwith.”   Under the circumstances, we conclude that Johnson’s\n\ngrievances were sufficient to give prison officials fair notice\n\nthat there might have been a sexual-orientation-related aspect to\n\nJohnson’s problem.\n\nB.   Which incidents?\n\n     Having decided which general theories Johnson may pursue, we\n\nturn next to examining which events he has exhausted.\n\n     Johnson’s claim is that prison officials failed to protect\n\nhim, over the course of some eighteen months, from near-constant\n\nsexual assault.   Johnson’s complaint, and his summary-judgment\n\nevidence, covers the repeated abuses in uncomfortable detail and\n\nlists many unsuccessful encounters with prison officials.    These\n\ninclude face-to-face encounters with several guards who allegedly\n\nfailed to take steps to protect Johnson on various occasions,\n\ncorrespondence with supervisory officials, and meetings with UCC\n\ncommittees.   The defendants contend that the only exhausted\n\nclaims in this case are those against two defendants, Wathen and\n\nKuyava, as regards their involvement in the March 16, 2001 UCC.\n\nThey reason that since TDCJ rules require that a Step 1 grievance\n\nbe filed within fifteen days of the complained-of event, a\n\ngrievance can only exhaust claims that relate to matters that\n\noccurred within the preceding fifteen days.   Therefore, Johnson’s\n\nMarch 18 Step 1 grievance could exhaust claims arising from the\n\n\n\n                                18\n\fMarch 16, 2001 UCC, but it could not exhaust any claims that\n\narise from conduct before March 2001.   Johnson’s December 2001\n\nStep 1 grievance, which was also appealed through Step 2, failed\n\nto exhaust any claims, continue the defendants, because no UCC\n\nmeeting occurred in the fifteen days preceding the filing of that\n\nStep 1 grievance.\n\n     Johnson did not use the formal grievance process--or,\n\nrather, he did not properly use it by both filing a Step 1\n\ngrievance and appealing the grievance to Step 2--until his March\n\n18, 2001 Step 1 grievance.   We agree with the defendants that\n\nJohnson has not exhausted any claims that arise from events that\n\noccurred more than fifteen days before this grievance.     While it\n\nis true that the conditions that Johnson suffered both before and\n\nafter the grievance were of the same general character, to permit\n\nthe March 2001 grievance to reach back to events that transpired\n\nup to six months earlier would effectively negate the state’s\n\nfifteen-day rule and frustrate the prison system’s legitimate\n\ninterest in investigating complaints while they are still fresh.\n\nThat a condition continues does not excuse the failure to file a\n\ngrievance earlier.   Accordingly, we hold that Johnson’s\n\ngrievances do not permit him to pursue claims regarding conduct\n\nthat occurred before March 2001; in particular, this means that\n\nhe has not exhausted claims related to the UCC meetings of\n\nSeptember 6, 2000, December 13, 2000, February 14, 2001, and\n\nFebruary 21, 2001; nor has he exhausted claims regarding his\n\n                                19\n\fencounters with Willingham, which all occurred before March\n\n2001.10\n\n     Having concluded that Johnson’s March 2001 grievance did not\n\nexhaust claims that involve events before the March 2001 UCC\n\nmeeting, we next consider whether Johnson has exhausted claims\n\nrelated to conduct that occurred after the March 2001 grievance.\n\nThe defendants contend that no such claims were exhausted because\n\nnone of the three subsequent UCC meetings at which Johnson was\n\ndenied protection--which occurred in September 2001, December\n\n2001, and January 2002--was followed within fifteen days by a\n\nStep 1 grievance.   In particular, Johnson’s December 30, 2001\n\nStep 1 grievance was a few days too late to reach the December\n\n2001 UCC meeting, which was held on the 13th.\n\n     We do not agree with the defendants’ argument that Johnson\n\nhas not exhausted any claims that arise from events later than\n\nthe March 16, 2001 UCC meeting.    The March 2001 grievance alerted\n\nprison officials to the fact that Johnson was being subjected to\n\nrepeated assaults and was not receiving any protection from the\n\nsystem, in particular a transfer to safekeeping status:\n\n     I am writing to state that I am a homosexual who and\n     [sic] is still being assaulted sexually, physically,\n     mentally.    I have brought this issue up to unit\n     administration a number of times and have failed to be\n\n     10\n          We pause to note that our holding does not mean that\ninformation regarding unexhausted events cannot be used as\nevidence, if relevant and otherwise admissible, in proving claims\nthat are exhausted.

Ashdown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324699\"><a href=\"/opinion/324699/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95032-united-states-of-america-v-edward-henry-ashdown/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n798 (5th Cir. 1975).\n\n                              20\n\f     moved to a safe location that houses other homosexuals.\n     . . .

After the officials rejected Johnson’s grievance, the\n\nsame condition of confinement of which he had been complaining\n\ncontinued.\n\n     After one full trip through the two-step review process,\n\nJohnson later filed the December 30, 2001 Step 1 grievance,\n\nwhich, according to the defendants, exhausted nothing because the\n\nmost recent prior UCC was on December 13, more than fifteen days\n\nearlier.

Thus, the prison\n\nadministration itself evidently did not understand Johnson’s\n\ngrievance as a complaint about the December 13 UCC meeting in\n\nparticular, but instead as a complaint about a continued lack of\n\nprotection.12\n\n     12\n          The grievance investigation form corresponding to the\nDecember 30 Step 1 grievance states, in the “Summary of Issue”\nsection, “Dupl. 2002058973.” This presumably means that\nadministrators understood it to duplicate grievance # 2002058973,\nwhich was filed on December 5 and which, in turn, was summarized\nby administrators as “[inmate] wants protection.” The grievance\ninvestigation form corresponding to the Step 2 appeal describes\nthe issue as a complaint about being threatened and harassed.\n\n                                  22\n\f     As a practical matter, Johnson could not have been expected\n\nto file a new grievance every fifteen days, or each time he was\n\nassaulted (which, according to him, was virtually every day), for\n\nthe entire period during which he remained unprotected in the\n\ngeneral population.

It would make little sense to require a\n\nprisoner being subjected to a frigid cell to continue to file\n\ngrievances stating that the cell remains frigid, and the same\n\nprinciple applies here.    Cf. Wilson v.

Johnson’s\n\ngrievances were sufficient to exhaust claims that arose from the\n\nsame continuing failure to protect him from sexual assault.\n\nThus, we disagree with the defendants’ suggestion that he has\n\nfailed to exhaust any claims relating to the September 2001,\n\nDecember 2001, and January 2002 UCC meetings.13\n\n     13\n          We pause to observe that we do not here hold that a\ngrievance filed in response to one particular incident\nautomatically exhausts claims that arise from future incidents of\nthe same general type. Thus, an inmate who claims to have been\nbeaten by guards (or, for that matter, not protected by guards)\nonce one month and again the next month can rightfully be\nexpected to grieve both incidents, following TDCJ’s fifteen-day\nrule in each case. Nor do we hold that Johnson would not be\nrequired to file additional grievances for future incidents that\nreflect a different problem. For instance, Johnson’s claims\nagainst Lieutenant Paul stem solely from the March 2002 incident\nin which Paul responded indifferently after Johnson reported\nbeing harassed in the shower. This discrete incident reflects a\ndifferent type of problem that would require a different\n\n                                 24\n\fC.   Which defendants?\n\n     Johnson has sued fifteen prison officials, but the\n\ndefendants contend that he has not exhausted his claims against\n\nmany of them.   In particular, they argue that a claim against a\n\nperson has been exhausted only if that person was identified in\n\nthe prisoner’s Step 1 grievance.\n\n     We are mindful that the primary purpose of a grievance is to\n\nalert prison officials to a problem, not to provide personal\n\nnotice to a particular official that he may be sued; the\n\ngrievance is not a summons and complaint that initiates\n\nadversarial litigation.    Cf. Brown, 212 F.3d at 1207-10\n\n(rejecting a rule that a prisoner must always name defendants in\n\nhis grievance).   But, at the same time, the grievance must\n\nprovide administrators with a fair opportunity under the\n\ncircumstances to address the problem that will later form the\n\nbasis of the suit, and for many types of problems this will often\n\nrequire, as a practical matter, that the prisoner’s grievance\n\nidentify individuals who are connected with the problem.\n\n     Non-UCC defendants.   Two of the defendants in this case,\n\nPaul and Willingham, are prison guards who are accused of failing\n\nto protect Johnson on a few discrete occasions.   The character of\n\nJohnson’s formal grievances is that he is frequently being\n\n\ngrievance. (Indeed, we will hold in the next section of the\nopinion that Johnson has not exhausted his claims against Paul.)\n\n\n\n                                 25\n\fassaulted and has repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought a change\n\nin housing status through the established administrative\n\nchannels.    Nowhere does he mention or describe Paul or\n\nWillingham.    Johnson’s grievances would alert administrators\n\nparticularly to problems regarding the prison’s housing and\n\nclassification practices, but we do not think that they can\n\nfairly be read to alert them to, or give them an opportunity to\n\nremedy, the discrete conduct that forms the basis of Johnson’s\n\nclaims against these two officers, which is of a different\n\ncharacter.    (In addition, as observed above, all of the conduct\n\nconcerning Willingham occurred before March 2001, which is an\n\nindependent reason to hold it unexhausted.)\n\n     Johnson has also sued three supervisory-level officials who\n\nnever sat on a UCC: Treon, Wright, and Executive Director\n\nJohnson.    Johnson specifically named Treon and Wright, but only\n\nin Step 2 grievances.    The defendants contend that this is\n\ninsufficient, for TDCJ rules instruct inmates not to “bring up\n\nnew grievance issues on appeal.”      But cf. Burton, 321 F.3d at 574\n\n(permitting a prisoner to provide “additional factual detail” at\n\nappellate stages of grievance process).     Johnson’s grievances did\n\nnot mention Executive Director Johnson, but Johnson says that\n\nthere is no need to mention the Executive Director.      See Brown,\n\n212 F.3d at 1209 (observing that “[e]veryone involved in the\n\ngrievance process knows who the warden and [state prison]\n\ncommissioner are”).    We need not struggle with these matters\n\n                                 26\n\fhere, however, because we determine in Part III of our opinion\n\nthat these three supervisory defendants are clearly entitled to\n\ndismissal based on qualified immunity.14\n\n     UCC defendants.   We held above that Johnson had not\n\nexhausted any claims related to UCC meetings before March 2001.\n\nWe now ask whether, regarding the exhausted UCC meetings,\n\nJohnson’s grievances adequately identified the relevant\n\ndefendants.\n\n     The defendants conceded at oral argument, and we agree, that\n\na grievance can sufficiently identify a person even if it does\n\nnot provide an actual name; functional descriptions and the like-\n\n-e.g., a reference to “the guards in the shower room” on a\n\ncertain date--would suffice.   Cf. id. at 1209-10 & n.4 (noting\n\nprison administrators’ superior access to personnel information\n\nand records).   As we have already said, Johnson’s grievances\n\nrepeatedly refer to the UCC committees and their failure to\n\nbelieve his pleas and take measures to protect him.   This was\n\nadequate to put the prison administrators on notice that members\n\nof the UCCs were connected, indeed most closely connected, with\n\nJohnson’s problem.\n\nD.   Summary\n\n     Drawing together the threads of the three arguments\n\nconsidered above, we conclude that many of Johnson’s claims were\n\n     14\n          We note that the exhaustion requirement is not\njurisdictional.

All of his race-\n\nbased Equal Protection claims are unexhausted, as are all claims\n\nagainst defendants Paul and Willingham.   So too are all claims\n\nrelated to all UCC meetings before the March 2001 meeting; in\n\nparticular, Johnson may not now pursue claims against Bright and\n\nKuyava as regards the September 6, 2000 UCC; Mooneyham and Vitolo\n\nas regards the December 13, 2000 UCC; Bowman, Boyle, and Kuyava\n\nas regards the February 14, 2001 UCC; and Vitolo and Wathen as\n\nregards the February 21, 2001 UCC.\n\n     The claims that are exhausted are Johnson’s Eighth Amendment\n\nclaims and his claims for failure to protect because of sexual\n\norientation under the Equal Protection Clause against Wathen and\n\nKuyava as regards the March 16, 2001 UCC; Wathen as regards the\n\nSeptember 5, 2001 UCC; Bowman, Kuyava, and Ranjel as regards the\n\nDecember 13, 2001 UCC; and Norwood, Vitolo, and Taylor as regards\n\nthe January 17, 2002 UCC.15\n\n     Finally, we find it unnecessary to reach a decision on\n\nexhaustion regarding the claims against Executive Director\n\nJohnson, Treon, and Wright.\n\n                  III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          We observe that the defendants have not argued in favor\nof a total exhaustion rule according to which an entire lawsuit\nmust be dismissed without prejudice when certain claims are\nexhausted but others are not.\n\n\n                               28\n\f     The defendants also appeal, in No. 03-10455, the district\n\ncourt’s denial of their motion for summary judgment on Johnson’s\n\nEighth Amendment claims.   Of course, in accordance with our\n\nrulings above, we need only consider those claims that Johnson\n\nexhausted.\n\nA.   Appellate jurisdiction in No. 03-10455\n\n     We begin by noting that Johnson has filed a motion to\n\ndismiss No. 03-10455 for want of appellate jurisdiction.\n\nAlthough a public official claiming qualified immunity can as a\n\ngeneral matter immediately appeal a denial of summary judgment,\n\nsee Mitchell v.

Rather, Johnson means only that the district court’s\n\nruling cannot be appealed to the extent that the official seeks\n\n\n\n                                29\n\fto challenge the district court’s determinations regarding the\n\nsufficiency of the summary-judgment record.    Id. at 313.\n\n“Johnson permits [a defendant official] to claim on appeal that\n\nall of the conduct which the District Court deemed sufficiently\n\nsupported for purposes of summary judgment met the Harlow\n\nstandard of ‘objective legal reasonableness.’” Id.    Yet while the\n\nappeal will not be dismissed, we are nonetheless required to\n\nlimit our review along the lines described in Johnson and\n\nBehrens.   That is, we may not consider any of the defendants’\n\narguments that challenge the district court’s assessment that\n\ncertain facts are sufficiently supported in the summary-judgment\n\nrecord.    This turns out to be an important limitation in this\n\ncase, as much (though not all) of the defendants’ argument asks\n\nus to contradict one of the district court’s determinations\n\nregarding the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nB.   Analysis\n\n     1.     Principles\n\n     The Supreme Court formally recognized and described the\n\nEighth Amendment failure-to-protect theory in Farmer v.

The\n\nCourt went on to explain that, to succeed on such a claim, “the\n\ninmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing\n\na substantial risk of serious harm” and that the prison officials\n\nacted with “deliberate indifference” to the inmate’s safety.      Id.\n\nat 834.   An official is deliberately indifferent when he “knows\n\nof and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety;\n\nthe official must both be aware of facts from which the inference\n\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\n\nand he must also draw the inference.”    Id. at 837.   The\n\nofficial’s knowledge of the risk can be proven through\n\ncircumstantial evidence, such as by showing that the risk was so\n\nobvious that the official must have known about it.       Id. at 842.\n\nFinally--and significantly for purposes of this case--there is no\n\nliability if the official “responded reasonably to the risk, even\n\nif the harm ultimately was not averted.”    Id. at 844.\n\n     The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity unless\n\ntheir conduct was not only illegal but also violated clearly\n\nestablished law such that their behavior was objectively\n\nunreasonable.   To be “clearly established” for purposes of\n\nqualified immunity, “[t]he contours of the right must be\n\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand\n\nthat what he is doing violates that right.”    Anderson v.\n\nCreighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (1987).    The law can be clearly\n\n                                31\n\festablished even without prior cases that are on all fours with\n\nthe present case, “so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable\n\nwarning that the conduct then at issue violated constitutional\n\nrights.”    Hope v.

Of course, the defendant’s conduct\n\ncannot constitute a violation of clearly established law if, on\n\nthe plaintiff’s version of the facts, there is no violation at\n\nall.    We therefore initially ask whether the challenged conduct\n\nactually presents a violation of federal law.

See Lemoine v. New Horizons Ranch & Ctr.,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"17531\"><a href=\"/opinion/17531/lemoine-v-new-horizons-ranch/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 634 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n       2.   Application\n\n       Most of the defendants’ brief in No. 03-10455 is devoted to\n\nshowing that Johnson “failed to create a fact question over\n\nwhether any [defendant’s] conduct violated Johnson’s\n\nconstitutional rights or whether any [defendant’s] conduct was\n\nobjectively unreasonable.”      In particular, they repeatedly seek\n\nto demonstrate that, based on the information before them when\n\n                                    32\n\fthey acted, either they did not realize the danger Johnson faced\n\nor they had reason to disbelieve Johnson’s complaints of repeated\n\nrape and abuse.    See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844 (explaining that\n\nprison officials can try to prove that they “did not know of the\n\nunderlying facts” or “believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk\n\n. . . was insubstantial or nonexistent”).   That particular\n\nargument, whether sound or not, is beyond the purview of this\n\nappeal.    The Supreme Court expressly stated in Farmer that\n\n“[w]hether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a\n\nsubstantial risk is a question of fact.”    Id. at 842 (emphasis\n\nadded).    The district court’s April 9 order, while less detailed\n\nthan ideal, clearly stated that there remained a fact question as\n\nto the defendants’ knowledge: “Whether any Defendant had the\n\nrequisite knowledge of a substantial risk of harm is a question\n\nof material fact that [this] Court cannot resolve on the current\n\nrecord.”   As explained earlier, we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nthe district court’s assessment that a genuine issue of fact\n\nexists as to some matter, and therefore we cannot look behind the\n\nruling that Johnson presented sufficient evidence for a fact-\n\nfinder to conclude that the defendants knew of the risk.       See\n\nSmith v. Brenoettsy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758683\"><a href=\"/opinion/758683/eric-smith-v-steve-brenoettsy-lieutenant-john-p-whitley-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 913 (5th Cir. 1998)\n\n(dismissing an interlocutory appeal where there was a factual\n\ndispute regarding whether defendant prison officials were aware\n\nof the danger to the inmate’s safety).   Accordingly, we must\n\nreject this aspect of the defendants’ argument on appeal.\n\n                                 33\n\f     Nonetheless, our inability to second-guess the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that there existed a fact issue regarding the\n\ndefendants’ awareness of the risk does not end our inquiry.\n\nUnder Farmer, prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment only\n\nif they are both aware of a substantial risk to inmate safety and\n\nfail to respond properly.    The Farmer Court emphasized that there\n\nis no Eighth Amendment violation if the official “responded\n\nreasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not\n\naverted.”   511 U.S. at 844.   Although the district court’s\n\nopinion in this case clearly stated that there were fact issues\n\nregarding the defendants’ knowledge of the risk, the opinion did\n\nnot directly address the material fact issues (if any) that\n\nexisted with respect to how the defendants responded to the risk.\n\nWhen the district court fails to set forth carefully the factual\n\ndisputes that preclude summary judgment, the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that “a court of appeals may have to undertake a\n\ncumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the\n\ndistrict court, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty, likely assumed.”     Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319.    Even assuming\n\nthat all of the defendants knew of the substantial risk to\n\nJohnson’s safety, there would be no Eighth Amendment violation if\n\nthe undisputed facts in the record demonstrated that they\n\nresponded reasonably.   Moreover, they would be entitled to\n\nqualified immunity unless clearly established law showed that\n\ntheir response was insufficient.       Accordingly, we must consider\n\n                                  34\n\fwhether some of the defendants might be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on those grounds.\n\n       Non-UCC defendants.   We concluded above that all claims\n\nagainst non-UCC defendants Paul and Willingham were unexhausted.\n\nWe pretermitted deciding the exhaustion issue as regards\n\nExecutive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright in favor of ruling\n\non qualified immunity, to which we now turn.    In addition to\n\ndischarging their usual duties of overseeing and reviewing those\n\nprison operations for which they were responsible, these\n\nsupervisory officials had notice of Johnson’s plight through\n\nvarious letters and life-endangerment forms.    Like all prison\n\nofficials, these supervisory defendants have a duty to take\n\nreasonable measures to protect inmates.     See Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n832.    Yet given the size of the operation that they oversee, they\n\ncannot be expected to intervene personally in response to every\n\ninmate letter they receive.    The record in this case shows that\n\nthey responded to Johnson’s complaints by referring the matter\n\nfor further investigation or taking similar administrative steps.\n\nThis was a reasonable discharge of their duty to protect the\n\ninmates in their care.    Given that neither the Supreme Court nor\n\nthis court has delineated the contours of what supervisory\n\nofficials must do on pain of personal liability, their conduct\n\ndid not violate clearly established law of which reasonable\n\nofficers should have known.    Therefore, they are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                  35\n\f      UCC defendants.   We held in Part II that Johnson had not\n\nexhausted some of his claims arising from certain UCC meetings\n\nbut that he had exhausted claims relating to the September 2001,\n\nDecember 2001, and January 2002 UCC meetings (in addition to the\n\nMarch 2001 meeting, which the defendants concede was exhausted).\n\nWe now consider whether the defendants involved in those meetings\n\nare nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n     Certain UCCs responded to Johnson’s claims by taking action\n\nsuch as ordering further investigation or separating Johnson from\n\na particular inmate who had been threatening him.    Those\n\nresponses were unavailing, but they may well have been reasonable\n\nmethods of addressing the risk that Johnson faced.    See id. at\n\n844 (observing that officials are not liable if they take\n\nreasonable measures, “even if the harm ultimately was not\n\naverted”).   The most diligent prison administrators cannot\n\nguarantee complete safety.   But unlike the UCCs that at least\n\ntook some (unsuccessful) measures to protect Johnson, the\n\nparticular UCC committees that we are now considering--March\n\n2001, September 2001, December 2001, and January 2002--did\n\nnothing in response to Johnson’s claims except (according to\n\nJohnson) tell him to fight off his attackers, despite the\n\ncommittee members’ awareness (which awareness we must assume in\n\nthis appeal) of the substantial risk that Johnson faced.\n\nAlthough it is not clear exactly what type of action an official\n\nis legally required to take under Farmer, the Supreme Court’s\n\n                                36\n\fopinion does make it abundantly clear that an official may not\n\nsimply send the inmate into the general population to fight off\n\nattackers.   See id. at 832-33 (explaining that jailers must “take\n\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates” and\n\n“are not free to let the state of nature take its course”\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).   (And Farmer\n\nitself is factually similar to today’s case in that it involved\n\nan effeminate prisoner who was raped after he was put in the\n\ngeneral prison population.   Id. at 829-30.)   The defendants, at\n\nleast according to Johnson, repeatedly expressed the view that\n\nJohnson must “learn to f*** or fight,” which runs directly\n\ncounter to Farmer’s directive.   Given the facts that we must\n\nassume for purposes of this appeal, this was not a reasonable\n\nresponse and it indeed contravenes clearly established law.\n\nMoreover, although the defendants contend that no single person\n\nacting alone could have granted Johnson’s requests--the UCC makes\n\nrecommendations to the state classification authority by majority\n\nvote of its three members, so nobody in particular is\n\nresponsible, they say--that does not transform this deliberately\n\nindifferent failure to take any action into a reasonable method\n\nof discharging their duty to protect the prisoners in their care.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity to Wathen and Kuyava as regards the March 16, 2001 UCC;\n\nWathen as regards the September 5, 2001 UCC; Bowman, Kuyava, and\n\nRanjel as regards the December 13, 2001 UCC; and Norwood, Vitolo,\n\n                                 37\n\fand Taylor as regards the January 17, 2002 UCC.16\n\n                    IV. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMS\n\n     Johnson relinquished Equal Protection claims against\n\nExecutive Director Johnson, Treon, Wright, Mooneyham, Willingham,\n\nand Paul.   After further subtracting claims that we deemed\n\nunexhausted in Part II, we are left with Johnson’s claims for\n\nfailure to protect because of sexual orientation against the\n\nparticipants in the March 2001, September 2001, December 2001,\n\nand January 2002 UCCs.\n\nA.   Appellate jurisdiction\n\n     Johnson has also filed a motion to dismiss No. 03-10505, the\n\ndefendants’ appeal from the district court’s denial of judgment\n\non the pleadings.   The defendants moved for judgment on the\n\npleadings in November 2002 and, while that motion was still\n\npending, moved for summary judgment in January 2003.   The first\n\nmotion largely involved Equal Protection claims, while the second\n\naddressed Eighth Amendment claims.   The district court denied the\n\nmotion for summary judgment in April 2003 and, a week later,\n\ndenied the motion for judgment on the pleadings.    The defendants\n\ntimely filed a notice of appeal regarding the denial of summary\n\n\n     16\n          We observe as well that Johnson appeared before a UCC\nin April 2002. It is not clear whether Johnson is pursuing\nclaims related to this meeting, at which Johnson was transferred\nto a different prison. Defendant Wathen was a member of this\ncommittee. If Johnson does mean to pursue such claims, we would\nhold that Wathen’s response was a reasonable one and that the\nimmunity defense should be upheld.\n\n                                38\n\fjudgment and later timely filed a notice of appeal regarding the\n\ndenial of judgment on the pleadings.   Johnson argues that, under\n\nthe circumstances of this case, the second-filed appeal does not\n\nqualify as an appealable decision under the collateral order\n\ndoctrine.\n\n     Johnson acknowledges that, as a general matter, rulings\n\ndenying qualified immunity--whether the ruling occurs at the\n\npleadings stage or at summary judgment--are immediately\n\nappealable under the collateral order doctrine’s exception to the\n\nfinal-judgment rule.   Moreover, Johnson recognizes that the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Behrens generally permits a public\n\nofficial to bring multiple qualified-immunity-based interlocutory\n\nappeals in the course of a single case.   See 516 U.S. at 306-07\n\n(permitting a public official to bring an interlocutory appeal of\n\nthe denial of his motion for summary judgment after the court of\n\nappeals had already affirmed and remanded on a previous\n\ninterlocutory appeal of the denial of his motion to dismiss).\n\nNonetheless, Johnson argues that those general principles are\n\ninapplicable to the unusual circumstances of this case.    A motion\n\nto dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings on qualified immunity\n\ngrounds is in the usual case immediately appealable, Johnson\n\nreasons, only because the public official would otherwise lose\n\nhis entitlement to be free from discovery; an appeal would do no\n\ngood if it came only after the official had already been\n\nsubjected to discovery during summary-judgment proceedings.    But\n\n                                39\n\fin this case, Johnson points out, (some) discovery has already\n\noccurred and the case has moved to the summary-judgment stage.\n\nThe justification for the immediate appeal of the motion to\n\ndismiss is therefore lacking in this case, he contends.\n\n     We conclude that Johnson’s motion is not well-taken.    The\n\nSupreme Court has announced the general rule that orders denying\n\nqualified immunity are treated as “final” and appealable, and we\n\nthink it improper to carve out an exception that responds to the\n\nprecise timing of the district court’s rulings.    The defendants’\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings on the Equal Protection\n\nclaims effectively asserted an immunity from discovery, from\n\nsuit, and from liability.   That some discovery did take place as\n\nthe proceedings moved into the summary-judgment stage does not\n\nmake the court’s denial of the motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings any less conclusive as regards the motion’s request for\n\nimmunity from trial and from liability.    See Behrens, 516 U.S. at\n\n306-09; Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526-28; cf. Matherne v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508755\"><a href=\"/opinion/508755/leroy-j-matherne-cross-appellant-v-charles-c-wilson-cross-appellees/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (5th Cir. 1988) (holding that an official who\n\nfailed to bring any interlocutory appeal could raise qualified\n\nimmunity in a post-verdict appeal of the final judgment, even\n\nthough the only aspect of his immunity that could still be\n\nvindicated at that stage was immunity from liability).\n\n     It also bears noting that the reason for the unusual course\n\nof proceedings cannot be attributed to any improper conduct or\n\nneglect on the part of the defendants.    They properly filed a\n\n                                40\n\fmotion for judgment on the pleadings that largely concerned the\n\nplaintiff’s Equal Protection claims.    While waiting for a ruling,\n\nthe defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment, which\n\nmostly involved the plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claims.    There\n\nwas nothing improper about how the defendants proceeded.    The\n\ndistrict court ruled first on the motion for summary judgment and\n\nlater concluded (perhaps erroneously) that the earlier motion was\n\ntherefore moot.   Either motion would, by itself, ordinarily\n\nsupport an interlocutory appeal.     This case presents no reason to\n\nmuddle the otherwise clear right of a public official to bring an\n\ninterlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified immunity.17    We\n\nwill therefore consider the merits of the appeal.\n\nB.   Analysis\n\n     The district court’s denial of the defendants’ Rule 12(c)\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings is reviewed de novo.      Great\n\nPlains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"29560\"><a href=\"/opinion/29560/grt-plains-trust-co-v-morgan-stanley-et-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312 (5th Cir. 2002).   The standard for dismissal under Rule\n\n\n     17\n          An instructive contrast with today’s case is presented\nby Armstrong v. Texas State Board of Barber Examiners, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6656\"><a href=\"/opinion/6656/armstrong-v-texas-state-bd-of-barber-examiners/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1994). There, the defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment simply repeated the same pleadings-based arguments that\nthe defendant had earlier raised in an unsuccessful motion to\ndismiss, which the defendant did not appeal. The panel concluded\nthat the defendant was merely trying to circumvent the long-\nelapsed deadline for filing an appeal of the denial of the motion\nto dismiss, and it dismissed the appeal. Id. at 644. In today’s\ncase, by contrast, the defendants’ two motions rely on somewhat\ndifferent grounds. Further, both appeals were timely filed, so\nit cannot be said that the defendants are trying to evade any\ndeadline.\n\n                                41\n\f12(c) is the same as that for dismissal for failure to state a\n\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6).     Id. at 313 n.8.    We accept the\n\ncomplaint’s well-pleaded facts as true and view them in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.       Id. at 312-13.   The motion to\n\ndismiss should not be granted unless the plaintiff would not be\n\nentitled to relief under any set of facts that he could prove\n\nconsistent with the complaint.     Id. at 313.\n\n     At the outset, there is some dispute regarding whether\n\nJohnson’s complaint should be measured against a heightened\n\npleading standard rather than the normal Rule 8(a) standard,\n\nwhich requires only a “short and plain statement of the claim.”\n\nIn our decision in Schultea v. Wood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689902\"><a href=\"/opinion/689902/joseph-m-schultea-sr-v-david-robert-wood-david-robert-wood-homer/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1427</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1995)\n\n(en banc), this court modified our prior practice of requiring\n\nheightened, detail-oriented pleading in § 1983 cases against\n\npublic officials.     After Schultea, a plaintiff no longer needs to\n\n“anticipate the [qualified immunity] defense in his complaint at\n\nthe risk of dismissal under Rule 12.”       Id. at 1430.18   The\n\nconsiderations that had led to the adoption of heightened\n\npleading would henceforth be satisfied, the court held, through\n\nthe device of a detailed Rule 7 reply, which the district court\n\ncould order on the defendant’s motion or sua sponte.         Id. at\n\n1433.     No such Rule 7 reply was requested or ordered in this\n\n\n     18\n          Schultea nonetheless cautioned that, in making his\n“short and plain statement of his complaint” under Rule 8, the\nplaintiff may not rest on “conclusions alone.” 47 F.3d at 1433.\n\n                                  42\n\fcase, and the defendants have not appealed the district court’s\n\ndecision not to require one.    As we have observed already,\n\nJohnson’s complaint is quite detailed and factually explicit, and\n\nthe defendants’ answer was in the nature of a blanket denial.\n\n     Notwithstanding that there was no Rule 7 reply, the\n\ndefendants contend that the standards for Rule 7 replies should\n\ngovern instead of the rules characteristic of notice-pleading\n\nunder Rule 8(a).   Their reasoning is that the local rules for the\n\nNorthern District of Texas disfavor motions for a more definite\n\nstatement and that, according to their own knowledge and their\n\nconversations with court personnel, motions for a Rule 7 reply\n\nare treated the same way.    Johnson aptly responds to the\n\ndefendants’ contentions by citing cases in which courts in the\n\nNorthern District have granted motions requesting Rule 7 replies.\n\nIf the district court were flouting Schultea--which we presume\n\nour district courts would not do--the defendants should have\n\nfiled a motion for a Rule 7 reply and appealed its denial.     As\n\nthey did not, we will apply the ordinary rules that govern the\n\nsufficiency of complaints.\n\n     2.   Whether the complaint adequately stated a claim\n\n     Turning to the sufficiency of the complaint, the defendants\n\nmake three arguments in support of their view that Johnson’s\n\npleadings failed to allege any Equal Protection violations.     If\n\nJohnson has indeed failed to allege a violation, then of course\n\nthere can be no violation of clearly established law that would\n\n                                 43\n\fovercome qualified immunity.   See Siegert, 500 U.S. at 232.    We\n\nconsider each of the defendants’ criticisms of the complaint in\n\nturn.\n\n     First, the defendants argue that Johnson’s pleadings fail\n\nbecause he did not allege that the prison officials’\n\nclassification decisions were not rationally related to any\n\nlegitimate penological interest.     It is important to point out\n\nthat the defendants themselves have not attempted to articulate\n\nany legitimate interests that could justify giving less\n\nprotection to homosexual inmates.     Rather, their position in this\n\ncase has consistently been that they did not in fact act on that\n\nbasis.   Nonetheless, they contend that there is a pleading\n\nrequirement that the plaintiff must allege in his complaint the\n\nlack of any rational relationship to a legitimate penological\n\ninterest.   Although they are correct that the prisoner, not the\n\nstate, bears the burden of proving that a challenged policy is\n\ninvalid because it does not bear a rational relationship to\n\nlegitimate objectives, Overton v. Bazzetta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130150\"><a href=\"/opinion/130150/overton-v-bazzetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132\n\n(2003), that does not necessarily mean that the prisoner’s\n\ncomplaint must allege the absence of such a relationship on pain\n\nof dismissal.   Cf. Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1987)\n\n(stating that “there must be a valid, rational connection between\n\nthe prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest\n\nput forward to justify it” (internal quotation marks omitted and\n\nemphasis added)).   In any event, Johnson’s complaint does include\n\n                                44\n\fstatements that the defendants subjected him to “an arbitrary and\n\nirrational classification” and acted out of “hostility and\n\nanimus.”   If a plaintiff’s complaint must deny any rational\n\nrelationship to legitimate penological aims even when those aims\n\nhave not been articulated, Johnson’s complaint satisfies the\n\nrequirement.\n\n     Second, the defendants contend that, as mere comments alone\n\ndo not violate the Equal Protection Clause, Johnson has not\n\nalleged that he has suffered any actionable discriminatory\n\ntreatment.   This argument misconstrues the nature of Johnson’s\n\nclaim.   He does not contend that the comments made by certain\n\ndefendants are themselves actionable.   Rather, his complaint\n\nrepeatedly alleges that he was denied protection because of his\n\nsexual orientation; the comments are relevant because they tend\n\nto reveal the defendants’ reasons for their actions in denying\n\nhim safekeeping.   See Williams v. Bramer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18033\"><a href=\"/opinion/18033/williams-v-bramer/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (5th\n\nCir. 1999) (explaining that while an official’s use of racial\n\nepithets “without harassment or some other conduct that deprives\n\nthe victim of established rights . . . does not amount to an\n\nequal protection violation,” the use of epithets is “strong\n\nevidence” that the official’s actions are racially motivated).\n\n     Third, the defendants argue that the complaint fails to\n\nidentify any non-homosexual prisoners who were similarly situated\n\nbut were treated better.   This argument is unavailing for several\n\nreasons.   Johnson’s complaint did contain general allegations to\n\n                                45\n\fthe effect that he qualified for safekeeping status but was\n\ntreated differently than other vulnerable inmates because of his\n\nsexual orientation.   He alleged, for instance, that the\n\ndefendants “treated him differently than other similarly situated\n\ninmates based on their hostility and animus towards non-\n\naggressive gay men.”19   It is unclear how a prisoner is supposed\n\nto possess identifying information regarding other inmates’\n\ntreatment at the complaint stage.     But, in any event, evidence of\n\nthe type the defendants request is not essential to the claim.\n\nIn most cases, a plaintiff lacks direct evidence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, and he therefore will try to rely on evidence\n\nthat two groups received different treatment, which can support\n\nan inference that the decisionmaker purposefully engaged in\n\ndiscrimination.   But those kinds of inference-producing\n\ncomparisons are unnecessary where the § 1983 plaintiff has direct\n\nevidence of discriminatory motive.     See Wallace v. Tex. Tech\n\nUniv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9024\"><a href=\"/opinion/9024/wallace-v-texas-tech-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1047-48 (5th Cir. 1996).     Indeed, Johnson’s\n\n\n     19\n            The defendants at one point assert that “[a]ll of\nPlaintiff’s allegations regarding equal protection are made on\n‘information and belief,’” and they argue that such allegations\nare improper. It is inaccurate to say that “all” of the\nallegations are so phrased. The only “information and belief”\nallegations related to this subject are a few that concern\nwhether the defendants have a “custom and practice” of denying\nsafekeeping to vulnerable black and homosexual inmates. Further,\n“information and belief” pleadings are generally deemed\npermissible under the Federal Rules, especially in cases in which\nthe information is more accessible to the defendant. See 5\nCHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE\n§ 1224 (2d ed. 1990).\n\n                                 46\n\fcomplaint contains detailed allegations that, if true, would\n\nconstitute direct evidence that the defendants treated Johnson\n\ndifferently in making their decisions and did so because of his\n\nstatus.20   Leaving aside the question whether identifying\n\ninformation about other inmates would even be available to a\n\nplaintiff at the pleading stage, we do not believe that a\n\nplaintiff’s complaint must plead the circumstantial case that the\n\ndefendants are requesting.

See, e.g., Complaint at\n¶ 33 (“We don’t protect punks on this farm.”), ¶ 55 (“There is no\nreason why Black punks can’t fight and survive in general\npopulation if they don’t want to f***.”), ¶ 86 (“You like this\n. . . .

At the end of\ntheir brief in No. 03-10455, the separate appeal from the denial\nof the motion for summary judgment, which mostly pertains to the\nEighth Amendment, the defendants incorporate by reference the\npleadings-based Equal Protection arguments from the other brief.\nThe defendants’ brief in No. 03-10455 then purports to argue, in\na few sentences without any citations to authorities or the\nrecord, that Johnson has also failed to provide sufficient\nevidence to survive summary judgment on his Equal Protection\nclaims. This briefing on the evidentiary support for the Equal\nProtection claims (as opposed to the adequacy of the pleadings)\nis likely inadequate to present the issue. See L & A Contracting\nCo. v. S. Concrete Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663735\"><a href=\"/opinion/663735/l-a-contracting-company-plaintiff-counter-v-southern-concrete-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (5th Cir.\n1994). In any event, the result would not differ if summary-\njudgment standards were applied to the Equal Protection claims.\nJohnson’s affidavit recounts the same inflammatory statements\nalleged in his complaint, which constitute direct evidence. The\ndefendants point out that a couple of the defendants--including\nVitolo, a defendant at issue here--did not make such comments.\nYet Johnson’s affidavit says that Vitolo laughed during the\nmeeting when one of the other UCC members said that Johnson did\nnot need protection from rape because he liked having sex with\nmen. Further, Johnson had filed a motion to compel disclosure of\nstatistics on safekeeping that might provide the circumstantial\nevidence of intentional discrimination that the defendants fault\nhim for not employing. Johnson’s response to the motion for\nsummary judgment included a Rule 56(f) affidavit that alerted the\ndistrict court to the pendency of his request for this\ninformation.\n\n                                48\n\fEqual Protection Clause, when the use is rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate penological interest.”   No Supreme Court or Fifth\n\nCircuit case, they say, has considered the extent to which sexual\n\norientation can be considered in housing classifications.\n\n     The defendants’ manner of phrasing the issue is inapt.\n\nFirst, while it is somewhat uncertain to what extent sexual\n\norientation can legitimately be taken into account in fashioning\n\nprison housing policies,22 the defendants in this case deny that\n\nthey took Johnson’s race and orientation into account.   That is,\n\nthey do not say that such status-based decisionmaking would be\n\njustified because of legitimate countervailing penological aims--\n\nas they would need to say in a case involving a policy of housing\n\nall black or all homosexual inmates together--but rather they say\n\nthat they made their decisions based on a status-neutral\n\ndetermination that Johnson was not unusually vulnerable.\n\n     Second, if they actually did deny Johnson protection because\n\nof his homosexuality, as Johnson alleges and as we must assume\n\nfor purposes of analysis, that decision would certainly not\n\neffectuate any legitimate interest.   See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833\n\n(“[G]ratuitously allowing the beating or rape of one prisoner by\n\nanother serves no legitimate penological objectiv[e].” (second\n\n     22\n          We observe that the Supreme Court has granted\ncertiorari to decide whether a prison’s policy of segregating\nincoming prisoners by race for a period of sixty days violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause.

It\n\nis clearly established that all prison inmates are entitled to\n\nreasonable protection from sexual assault.   See id. at 832-34.\n\n(As it happens, the abused inmate in Farmer was a feminine-\n\nlooking preoperative male-to-female transsexual.)   Neither the\n\nSupreme Court nor this court has recognized sexual orientation as\n\na suspect classification [or protected group]; nevertheless, a\n\nstate violates the Equal Protection Clause if it disadvantages\n\nhomosexuals for reasons lacking any rational relationship to\n\nlegitimate governmental aims.   Romer v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631-\n\n32 (1996).   The defendants have not attempted to argue that\n\naccording homosexuals less protection than other inmates would\n\nadvance any legitimate aim.   Thus, we conclude that Johnson has\n\nalleged conduct that would be unreasonable in light of law that\n\nwas clearly established at the time of the alleged events.\n\n                           V. CONCLUSION\n\n     Johnson’s motions to dismiss Nos. 03-10455 and 03-10505 are\n\nDENIED.   We REVERSE the district court’s judgment to the extent\n\nthat it concluded that Johnson had exhausted: race-based Equal\n\nProtection claims; claims against defendants Paul and Willingham;\n\nclaims against Bright and Kuyava as regards the September 6, 2000\n\nUCC; claims against Mooneyham and Vitolo as regards the December\n\n13, 2000 UCC; claims against Bowman, Boyle, and Kuyava as regards\n\nthe February 14, 2001 UCC; and claims against Vitolo and Wathen\n\n\n\n                                50\n\fas regards the February 21, 2001 UCC.     See supra Part II.D.\n\nTurning to the exhausted claims, we also REVERSE the district\n\ncourt’s judgment to the extent that it denied qualified immunity\n\nto Executive Director Johnson, Treon, and Wright.    The district\n\ncourt’s judgment is otherwise AFFIRMED.    The case is REMANDED to\n\nthe district court, for dismissal of the claims listed above and\n\nfor further proceedings on the remaining claims.\n\n     Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\nMOTIONS DENIED; AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                               51\n\f</pre>",
