The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants\n\nbased on qualified immunity. We affirm.\n\n                              I.       BACKGROUND\n\n      Lobozzo was an inmate at the Pueblo, Colorado, La Vista Correctional Facility in\n\n2007. Sometime in May or June 2007, Lobozzo began to have sexual contact with\n\ncorrectional officer Anthony Martinez while assigned to his work unit. She did not tell\n\nanyone but in June 2007, rumors of the relationship began to spread. At Martinez’s\n\nurging Lobozzo asked for a meeting with other officers to quell the rumors. On June 8,\n\n2007, Martinez and Lobozzo met with several female officers. Lobozzo denied she was\n\nhaving a sexual relationship with Martinez. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the\n\nmeeting the other officers advised Martinez to let others work with Lobozzo. Apparently\n\nMartinez ignored this advice because, on July 15, 2007, another female officer caught\n\nLobozzo and Martinez in a custodian’s closet. Although dressed, their clothes were\n\nrumpled and Martinez was in an obvious state of arousal. As she was unsure what to do,\n\nthe officer waited four hours before reporting the incident. Martinez was suspended the\n\nR. 32.1(A). Citation to an order and judgment must be accompanied by an appropriate\nparenthetical notation B (unpublished). Id.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fnext day1 and Lobozzo was placed in administrative segregation. She was transferred to\n\nthe Cañon City Colorado Women’s Correctional facility within days and again placed in\n\na segregation unit.\n\n       On August 27, 2008, Lobozzo filed a § 1983 action against Aristedes Zavaras,\n\nExecutive Director of the CDOC, Gary Golder, Director of Prisons in 2007, Susan Jones,\n\nwarden at the La Vista facility from October 2006 through September 2007, Larry Reid,\n\nWarden at the La Vista facility from September 2007,2 and James Abbott, warden at the\n\nCañon City facility in 2007 (collectively the CDOC Defendants).3 The complaint alleged\n\nthe CDOC Defendants violated Lobozzo’s Eighth Amendment rights by their deliberate\n\nindifference to the possibility of sexual abuse of inmates by custodial staff and they\n\nviolated her First Amendment rights by establishing a policy of punishing victims for\n\nspeaking about such abuse.\n\n       After a hearing on the CDOC Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court determined they were entitled to qualified immunity because Lobozzo failed\n\nto show how they caused any constitutional violation. It entered summary judgment\n\naccordingly.\n\n       Lobozzo now argues the CDOC Defendants violated her Eighth Amendment\n\nrights by failing to draft, review or enforce adequate protective policies in spite of their\n\n\n       1\n           He was also charged with, and pled guilty to, a criminal violation.\n       2\n        On appeal, Lobozzo concedes there is insufficient evidence against Reid.\n(Appellant’s Br. at 8.)\n       3\n        She also named Martinez as a defendant but he filed for bankruptcy and was\ndismissed from the action.\n\n                                              -3-\n\fknowledge that female prisoners were subject to sexual assault.\n\n                                 II.       DISCUSSION\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s decision to grant summary judgment\n\nasserting qualified immunity. Armijo ex. rel. Armijo Sanchez v. Peterson, 601 F.3d 1065,\n\n1070 (10th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1473 (2011). Qualified immunity\n\nrecognizes the “need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and\n\nthe related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.”\n\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 807 (1982) (quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S.\n\n478, 508 (1978)). It protects federal and state officials from liability for discretionary\n\nfunctions, and from “the unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those\n\ndefending a long drawn out lawsuit.” Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991)).\n\nIssues of qualified immunity are best resolved at the “earliest possible stage in litigation.”\n\nPearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815 (2009) (quoting Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S.\n\n224, 227 (1991)).\n\n       Qualified immunity shields government officials from liability where “their\n\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n\nreasonable person would have known.” Id. (quotations omitted).\n\n       When a defendant asserts qualified immunity at summary judgment, the\n       responsibility shifts to the plaintiff to meet a “heavy two-part burden,”\n       demonstrating, first, that the defendant’s actions violated a constitutional or\n       statutory right and, second, that the right at issue was clearly established at\n       the time of the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct. In assessing\n       whether the right was clearly established, we ask whether the right was\n       sufficiently clear that a reasonable government officer in the defendant’s\n       shoes would understand that what he or she did violated that right. If the\n       plaintiff fails to satisfy either part of the two-part inquiry, we must grant the\n\n                                             -4-\n\f       defendant qualified immunity.\n\nCasey v. W. Las Vegas Indep. Sch. Dist., 473 F.3d 1323, 1327 (10th Cir. 2007) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n       A clearly established right is generally defined as a right so thoroughly developed\n\nand consistently recognized under the law of the jurisdiction as to be “indisputable” and\n\n“unquestioned.” Zweibon v. Mitchell, 720 F.2d 162, 172-173 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\n\n“Ordinarily, in order for the law to be clearly established, there must be a Supreme Court\n\nor Tenth Circuit decision on point, or the clearly established weight of authority from\n\nother courts must have found the law to be as the plaintiff maintains.” Currier v. Doran,\n\n242 F.3d 905, 923 (10th Cir. 2001) (quotation and citation omitted).\n\n       The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment imposes a\n\nduty on prison officials to provide humane conditions of confinement, including\n\nreasonable safety from serious bodily harm. Tafoya v. Salazar, 516 F.3d 912, 916 (10th\n\nCir. 2008) (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994)). The prisoner must\n\nshow “the alleged injury or deprivation [is] sufficiently serious” and “the prison official\n\nmust have a sufficiently culpable state of mind to violate the constitutional standard.” Id.\n\n“[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an\n\ninmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an\n\nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety . . . .” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. The official\n\nmust be “aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” Id. The official’s “failure to\n\nalleviate a significant risk of which he was unaware, no matter how obvious the risk or\n\n                                            -5-\n\fhow gross his negligence in failing to perceive it, is not an infliction of punishment and\n\ntherefore not a constitutional violation.” Tafoya, 516 F.3d at 916. “[E]ven if a prison\n\nofficial has knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to inmates, he is not\n\ndeliberately indifferent to that risk unless he is aware of and fails to take reasonable steps\n\nto alleviate that risk.” Id. “[A] plaintiff must plead [and demonstrate] that each\n\nGovernment-official defendant, through the official’s own individual actions, has\n\nviolated the Constitution.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1948 (2009). Although\n\ndeliberate indifference is a subjective inquiry, “a jury is permitted to infer that a prison\n\nofficial had actual knowledge of the constitutionally infirm condition based solely on\n\ncircumstantial evidence, such as the obviousness of the condition” -- a risk so obvious a\n\nreasonable man “might well infer that the prison official did in fact realize it.” Tafoya,\n\n516 F.3d at 916-17.\n\n       It is uncontested that Lobozzo, an inmate, could not legally consent to sexual\n\nactivity with Martinez, a guard. And no one disputes that rape is sufficiently serious to\n\nconstitute a constitutional violation. The question is whether these defendants were\n\naware of and ignored an excessive risk that Lobozzo would be subjected to sexual contact\n\nby a correctional officer.\n\n       Lobozzo claims the statistics reported by the CDOC under the Prison Rape\n\nElimination Act (PREA) from 2005 forward reveal an average of “one to two . . . rapes\n\nper month” at CDOC facilities and such revelations gave the officials constructive notice\n\n\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fof the danger.4 (Appellant’s Br. at 3.) Lobozzo assumes5 Warden Jones knew about the\n\nguard’s meeting in June and should have intervened at that time. Lobozzo points to\n\nJones’ knowledge of one incident in the previous March where Martinez entered a cell\n\nwhile an inmate was dressing and he continued to do a cell search despite the fact the\n\ninmate was in her underwear and “was pulling up her pants when he walked in.” [130]\n\nLobozzo also asserts the CDOC’s deliberate indifference is further demonstrated by\n\nWarden Abbott’s failure to ensure she was given the proper medical or mental health\n\ntreatment following her transfer to Cañon City after the Martinez assault came to light.\n\n       To establish the known risk of sexual assault on her, Lobozzo relies almost\n\nexclusively on the CDOC’s expert’s deposition testimony relating to the PREA statistics\n\nfrom 2005 through 2007 compiled by the CDOC. The report contains numbers of\n\nincidents of specific types of conduct. Relevant here, the report identifies incidents of:\n\n(1) staff-on-inmate sexual assault, defined as “unwanted sexual intrusion or penetration\n\nby force, threat, coercion or intimidation;” (2) staff-on-inmate sexual conduct defined as\n\n“inappropriate sexual contact between Staff and Inmates which includes romantic\n\nrelationships, love letters, or sexual activity;” (3) staff-on-inmate sexual harassment\n\nwhich includes “comments and gestures;” and (4) staff-on-inmate sexual misconduct\n\n\n       4\n         Labozzo complains that certain CDOC policies provide an opportunity for male\nguards’ abuse of female inmates and that CDOC is not in compliance with other of its\npolicies meant to prevent this situation. She does not, however specifically identify the\npolicies or include them in the record.\n       5\n         Warden Jones testified in her deposition that she could not “say with any\ncertainty that [she] heard about the June [issues].” (Appellant’s App’x. at 140.) There is\nno testimony stating Jones knew about the meeting.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fwhich includes “active or passive sexual contact, grabbing or fondling. This is usually\n\nreported as part of a staff pat search of offenders.” (Appellant’s App’x at 70.)\n\n       The expert stated the numbers revealed that, in the state of Colorado, “it seems\n\nlike in terms of founded cases [of guard-on prisoner sexual misconduct], maybe one or\n\ntwo a month.” (Appellant’s App’x at 150.) But this statement ignores the undisputed\n\nfact that, from 2005 through 2007 – until Lobozzo’s incident, there were no substantiated\n\noccurrences in any of these categories at the La Vista facility.6 Thus, there was no\n\nevidence demonstrating the CDOC Defendants would reasonably believe Lobozzo was at\n\nrisk while incarcerated at that facility.\n\n       Even looking at the reported numbers for all CDOC facilities, including parole and\n\ncommunity corrections, there were two incidents of sexual misconduct and one sexual\n\nassault substantiated in 2007, an average of 22 substantiated reports of sexual conduct\n\neach year from 2005 through 2007, and a total of five substantiated reports of sexual\n\nharassment. Lobozzo did not present any evidence of the number of sexual conduct\n\nincidents which actually involved “sexual activity.” She presented no contextual\n\nevidence showing the CDOC Defendants would know these raw and ambiguous numbers\n\npresented an unreasonable risk to inmates, whether the numbers were higher or lower\n\nthan the national average, how many of the victims were female or whether a change in\n\n\n\n       6\n        In 2005, there was one unfounded report of sexual conduct. In 2006, there was\none unfounded report of sexual assault, three unfounded reports of sexual conduct and\none unfounded report of sexual harassment. In 2007, there was the substantiated incident\nof sexual conduct between Martinez and Lobozzo and one unfounded report of sexual\nmisconduct. However, there is no information on the basis of the unfounded report.\n\n                                            -8-\n\fCDOC policies would likely reduce these numbers. And although Lobozzo insinuates\n\nWarden Jones knew of the rumors concerning the relationship with Martinez but did\n\nnothing to stop it, the record belies this claim. Jones’ unchallenged testimony stated she\n\ndid not know of the relationship nor was she aware of the rumors of a relationship prior\n\nto July 15, 2007. She “remember[ed] hearing about the issue in March with the entering\n\nthe room with someone not fully clothed. [But she couldn’t] say with any certainty she\n\nheard about the June [rumors].” (Appellant’s App’x at 140.)7\n\n       “The mere fact that an assault occurs does not establish the requisite indifference\n\nto a prisoner’s constitutional rights.” Hovater v. Robinson, 1 F.3d 1063, 1066 (10th Cir.\n\n1993) (quotations omitted). And “a constitutional violation may not be established by a\n\nreliance upon unsupported assumptions.” Id. at 1068. We do not mean to minimize the\n\nseriousness of Martinez’s actions and we deplore his victimization of Lobozzo. But just\n\nnumbers, such as Lobozzo presents, without more, do not create an inference that the\n\nCDOC Defendants “had actual or constructive notice that their action or failure was\n\nsubstantially certain to result in a constitutional violation, and they consciously and\n\ndeliberately chose to disregard the risk of harm.” Olsen v. Layton Hills Mall, 312 F.3d\n\n1304, 1319 (10th Cir. 2002) (quotations and citations omitted).\n\n       Lobozzo repeatedly asserts the evidence shows there were “two rapes” a month\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        The record is less than clear because the deposition testimony is presented in\nsnippets preventing any clear understanding of the actual context of the witnesses’\nstatements.\n\n                                            -9-\n\fwithin CDOC facilities.8 (Appellant’s Br. at 3, 9.) Even if the record supported this\n\nclaim, there is no reason to assume the mere number of incidents is sufficient evidence of\n\nan unreasonable response to a substantial risk in an isolated case. To so hold would\n\nsubject every institutional administrator to constitutional liability even if all possible\n\nactions were taken to correct an inherently dangerous situation. This would contradict\n\nthe standard clearly iterated by the Supreme Court – “a[n individual] prison official may\n\nbe held liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of\n\nconfinement only if [that] official knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.”\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 847 (emphasis added). The evidence must be robust and focused,\n\nnot scattered and speculative.\n\n       Lobozzo also alleges the CDOC’s policy of punishing inmates who reported\n\nsexual victimization by placing them in segregation violated her Eighth Amendment\n\nrights.9 Certainly she was placed in segregation immediately after the incident on July\n\n15, 2007, and again after her transfer to Cañon City. There is no testimony in the record\n\nstating how long she was in segregation after her transfer but, at the summary judgment\n\nhearing, her counsel claimed “[i]t was a few weeks as I recall now.” (Appellant’s App’x\n\n\n       8\n         Labozzo consistently refers to the fact there were “two rapes” per month in the\nCDOC. She fails to differentiate between incidents of wanted sexual activity and\nincidents of “romantic relationships [and] love letters,” all of which are included in the\ncategory of “staff sexual conduct” incidents in the CDOC report. This category was the\nsubject of the testimony regarding two incidents a month.\n       9\n       Lobozzo apparently withdrew her First Amendment claim at the summary\njudgment hearing.\n\n                                             - 10 -\n\fat 226.)\n\n       The only CDOC policy Lobozzo identified required witnesses to be isolated\n\nduring the investigation. See CDOC Admin. Reg. 100-4. [232-33] But she does not\n\nargue such isolation is unreasonable. In his deposition, Zavaras said segregation is\n\ngenerally to “protect[] her and the department relative to further allegations.”\n\n(Appellant’s App’x at 120.) He stated the isolation was not meant to punish the victim\n\nand it did not go on her record. There is no evidence Warden Abbott knew Lobozzo was\n\nplaced in segregation when she was transferred or that she remained there (if she did)\n\nafter the investigation was completed; she never filed a grievance. Similarly, there is no\n\nevidence Abbott knew her follow-up medical treatment was not adequate because, again,\n\nshe did not file a grievance to that effect. Therefore, even if the placement staff and the\n\nmedical staff somehow failed in their duties to Lobozzo after her transfer, the CDOC\n\nDefendants had no personal knowledge of any lack of necessary treatment.\n\n       Prisoners are sometimes victims of sexual abuse at the hands of staff and other\n\ninmates alike – a tragic fact demanding the attention of prison administrators. But\n\ndespite Lobozzo’s characterization of the record, there is no evidence any of the CDOC\n\nDefendants failed to take seriously their responsibility for the safety of inmates. She\n\nfailed to make a record equal to her rhetoric. The record simply does not support her\n\nallegations that the CDOC Defendants knew of and disregarded an excessive risk that she\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 11 -\n\fwould be sexually victimized by Martinez.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n                                      Entered by the Court:\n\n                                      Terrence L.

The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants\n\nbased on qualified immunity. We affirm.\n\n                              I.       BACKGROUND\n\n      Lobozzo was an inmate at the Pueblo, Colorado, La Vista Correctional Facility in\n\n2007. Sometime in May or June 2007, Lobozzo began to have sexual contact with\n\ncorrectional officer Anthony Martinez while assigned to his work unit. She did not tell\n\nanyone but in June 2007, rumors of the relationship began to spread. At Martinez’s\n\nurging Lobozzo asked for a meeting with other officers to quell the rumors. On June 8,\n\n2007, Martinez and Lobozzo met with several female officers. Lobozzo denied she was\n\nhaving a sexual relationship with Martinez. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the\n\nmeeting the other officers advised Martinez to let others work with Lobozzo. Apparently\n\nMartinez ignored this advice because, on July 15, 2007, another female officer caught\n\nLobozzo and Martinez in a custodian’s closet. Although dressed, their clothes were\n\nrumpled and Martinez was in an obvious state of arousal. As she was unsure what to do,\n\nthe officer waited four hours before reporting the incident. Martinez was suspended the\n\nR. 32.1(A). Citation to an order and judgment must be accompanied by an appropriate\nparenthetical notation B (unpublished). Id.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fnext day1 and Lobozzo was placed in administrative segregation. She was transferred to\n\nthe Cañon City Colorado Women’s Correctional facility within days and again placed in\n\na segregation unit.\n\n       On August 27, 2008, Lobozzo filed a § 1983 action against Aristedes Zavaras,\n\nExecutive Director of the CDOC, Gary Golder, Director of Prisons in 2007, Susan Jones,\n\nwarden at the La Vista facility from October 2006 through September 2007, Larry Reid,\n\nWarden at the La Vista facility from September 2007,2 and James Abbott, warden at the\n\nCañon City facility in 2007 (collectively the CDOC Defendants).3 The complaint alleged\n\nthe CDOC Defendants violated Lobozzo’s Eighth Amendment rights by their deliberate\n\nindifference to the possibility of sexual abuse of inmates by custodial staff and they\n\nviolated her First Amendment rights by establishing a policy of punishing victims for\n\nspeaking about such abuse.\n\n       After a hearing on the CDOC Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court determined they were entitled to qualified immunity because Lobozzo failed\n\nto show how they caused any constitutional violation. It entered summary judgment\n\naccordingly.\n\n       Lobozzo now argues the CDOC Defendants violated her Eighth Amendment\n\nrights by failing to draft, review or enforce adequate protective policies in spite of their\n\n\n       1\n           He was also charged with, and pled guilty to, a criminal violation.\n       2\n        On appeal, Lobozzo concedes there is insufficient evidence against Reid.\n(Appellant’s Br. at 8.)\n       3\n        She also named Martinez as a defendant but he filed for bankruptcy and was\ndismissed from the action.\n\n                                              -3-\n\fknowledge that female prisoners were subject to sexual assault.\n\n                                 II.

Although\n\ndeliberate indifference is a subjective inquiry, “a jury is permitted to infer that a prison\n\nofficial had actual knowledge of the constitutionally infirm condition based solely on\n\ncircumstantial evidence, such as the obviousness of the condition” -- a risk so obvious a\n\nreasonable man “might well infer that the prison official did in fact realize it.” Tafoya,\n\n516 F.3d at 916-17.\n\n       It is uncontested that Lobozzo, an inmate, could not legally consent to sexual\n\nactivity with Martinez, a guard. And no one disputes that rape is sufficiently serious to\n\nconstitute a constitutional violation. The question is whether these defendants were\n\naware of and ignored an excessive risk that Lobozzo would be subjected to sexual contact\n\nby a correctional officer.\n\n       Lobozzo claims the statistics reported by the CDOC under the Prison Rape\n\nElimination Act (PREA) from 2005 forward reveal an average of “one to two . . . rapes\n\nper month” at CDOC facilities and such revelations gave the officials constructive notice\n\n\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fof the danger.4 (Appellant’s Br. at 3.) Lobozzo assumes5 Warden Jones knew about the\n\nguard’s meeting in June and should have intervened at that time. Lobozzo points to\n\nJones’ knowledge of one incident in the previous March where Martinez entered a cell\n\nwhile an inmate was dressing and he continued to do a cell search despite the fact the\n\ninmate was in her underwear and “was pulling up her pants when he walked in.” [130]\n\nLobozzo also asserts the CDOC’s deliberate indifference is further demonstrated by\n\nWarden Abbott’s failure to ensure she was given the proper medical or mental health\n\ntreatment following her transfer to Cañon City after the Martinez assault came to light.\n\n       To establish the known risk of sexual assault on her, Lobozzo relies almost\n\nexclusively on the CDOC’s expert’s deposition testimony relating to the PREA statistics\n\nfrom 2005 through 2007 compiled by the CDOC. The report contains numbers of\n\nincidents of specific types of conduct. Relevant here, the report identifies incidents of:\n\n(1) staff-on-inmate sexual assault, defined as “unwanted sexual intrusion or penetration\n\nby force, threat, coercion or intimidation;” (2) staff-on-inmate sexual conduct defined as\n\n“inappropriate sexual contact between Staff and Inmates which includes romantic\n\nrelationships, love letters, or sexual activity;” (3) staff-on-inmate sexual harassment\n\nwhich includes “comments and gestures;” and (4) staff-on-inmate sexual misconduct\n\n\n       4\n         Labozzo complains that certain CDOC policies provide an opportunity for male\nguards’ abuse of female inmates and that CDOC is not in compliance with other of its\npolicies meant to prevent this situation. She does not, however specifically identify the\npolicies or include them in the record.\n       5\n         Warden Jones testified in her deposition that she could not “say with any\ncertainty that [she] heard about the June [issues].” (Appellant’s App’x. at 140.) There is\nno testimony stating Jones knew about the meeting.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fwhich includes “active or passive sexual contact, grabbing or fondling. This is usually\n\nreported as part of a staff pat search of offenders.” (Appellant’s App’x at 70.)\n\n       The expert stated the numbers revealed that, in the state of Colorado, “it seems\n\nlike in terms of founded cases [of guard-on prisoner sexual misconduct], maybe one or\n\ntwo a month.” (Appellant’s App’x at 150.) But this statement ignores the undisputed\n\nfact that, from 2005 through 2007 – until Lobozzo’s incident, there were no substantiated\n\noccurrences in any of these categories at the La Vista facility.6 Thus, there was no\n\nevidence demonstrating the CDOC Defendants would reasonably believe Lobozzo was at\n\nrisk while incarcerated at that facility.\n\n       Even looking at the reported numbers for all CDOC facilities, including parole and\n\ncommunity corrections, there were two incidents of sexual misconduct and one sexual\n\nassault substantiated in 2007, an average of 22 substantiated reports of sexual conduct\n\neach year from 2005 through 2007, and a total of five substantiated reports of sexual\n\nharassment. Lobozzo did not present any evidence of the number of sexual conduct\n\nincidents which actually involved “sexual activity.” She presented no contextual\n\nevidence showing the CDOC Defendants would know these raw and ambiguous numbers\n\npresented an unreasonable risk to inmates, whether the numbers were higher or lower\n\nthan the national average, how many of the victims were female or whether a change in\n\n\n\n       6\n        In 2005, there was one unfounded report of sexual conduct. In 2006, there was\none unfounded report of sexual assault, three unfounded reports of sexual conduct and\none unfounded report of sexual harassment. In 2007, there was the substantiated incident\nof sexual conduct between Martinez and Lobozzo and one unfounded report of sexual\nmisconduct. However, there is no information on the basis of the unfounded report.\n\n                                            -8-\n\fCDOC policies would likely reduce these numbers. And although Lobozzo insinuates\n\nWarden Jones knew of the rumors concerning the relationship with Martinez but did\n\nnothing to stop it, the record belies this claim. Jones’ unchallenged testimony stated she\n\ndid not know of the relationship nor was she aware of the rumors of a relationship prior\n\nto July 15, 2007. She “remember[ed] hearing about the issue in March with the entering\n\nthe room with someone not fully clothed. [But she couldn’t] say with any certainty she\n\nheard about the June [rumors].” (Appellant’s App’x at 140.)7\n\n       “The mere fact that an assault occurs does not establish the requisite indifference\n\nto a prisoner’s constitutional rights.” Hovater v.

We do not mean to minimize the\n\nseriousness of Martinez’s actions and we deplore his victimization of Lobozzo. But just\n\nnumbers, such as Lobozzo presents, without more, do not create an inference that the\n\nCDOC Defendants “had actual or constructive notice that their action or failure was\n\nsubstantially certain to result in a constitutional violation, and they consciously and\n\ndeliberately chose to disregard the risk of harm.” Olsen v.

Even if the record supported this\n\nclaim, there is no reason to assume the mere number of incidents is sufficient evidence of\n\nan unreasonable response to a substantial risk in an isolated case. To so hold would\n\nsubject every institutional administrator to constitutional liability even if all possible\n\nactions were taken to correct an inherently dangerous situation. This would contradict\n\nthe standard clearly iterated by the Supreme Court – “a[n individual] prison official may\n\nbe held liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of\n\nconfinement only if [that] official knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.”\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 847 (emphasis added). The evidence must be robust and focused,\n\nnot scattered and speculative.\n\n       Lobozzo also alleges the CDOC’s policy of punishing inmates who reported\n\nsexual victimization by placing them in segregation violated her Eighth Amendment\n\nrights.9 Certainly she was placed in segregation immediately after the incident on July\n\n15, 2007, and again after her transfer to Cañon City. There is no testimony in the record\n\nstating how long she was in segregation after her transfer but, at the summary judgment\n\nhearing, her counsel claimed “[i]t was a few weeks as I recall now.” (Appellant’s App’x\n\n\n       8\n         Labozzo consistently refers to the fact there were “two rapes” per month in the\nCDOC. She fails to differentiate between incidents of wanted sexual activity and\nincidents of “romantic relationships [and] love letters,” all of which are included in the\ncategory of “staff sexual conduct” incidents in the CDOC report. This category was the\nsubject of the testimony regarding two incidents a month.\n       9\n       Lobozzo apparently withdrew her First Amendment claim at the summary\njudgment hearing.\n\n                                             - 10 -\n\fat 226.)\n\n       The only CDOC policy Lobozzo identified required witnesses to be isolated\n\nduring the investigation. See CDOC Admin. Reg. 100-4. [232-33] But she does not\n\nargue such isolation is unreasonable. In his deposition, Zavaras said segregation is\n\ngenerally to “protect[] her and the department relative to further allegations.”\n\n(Appellant’s App’x at 120.) He stated the isolation was not meant to punish the victim\n\nand it did not go on her record. There is no evidence Warden Abbott knew Lobozzo was\n\nplaced in segregation when she was transferred or that she remained there (if she did)\n\nafter the investigation was completed; she never filed a grievance. Similarly, there is no\n\nevidence Abbott knew her follow-up medical treatment was not adequate because, again,\n\nshe did not file a grievance to that effect. Therefore, even if the placement staff and the\n\nmedical staff somehow failed in their duties to Lobozzo after her transfer, the CDOC\n\nDefendants had no personal knowledge of any lack of necessary treatment.\n\n       Prisoners are sometimes victims of sexual abuse at the hands of staff and other\n\ninmates alike – a tragic fact demanding the attention of prison administrators. But\n\ndespite Lobozzo’s characterization of the record, there is no evidence any of the CDOC\n\nDefendants failed to take seriously their responsibility for the safety of inmates.
