Norma moves out of the Property with the intention of\n                 not returning, and Roy files for divorce...................................... 4\n\n        D.       After Norma abandons her undivided one–half interest\n                 in the Property, Hankins obtains a writ of execution,\n                 which eventually leads to Norma’s interest in the\n                 Property being levied. ................................................................. 6\n\n        E.       Norma and Roy devise a scheme to put Norma’s\n                 undivided one–half interest out of the reach of her\n                 judgment creditor, Hankins. ...................................................... 7\n\n        F.

Even if the Divorce Decree and Marriage\n                       Settlement Agreement constitute a valid\n                       conveyance (they do not), any interest Roy\n                       acquired during the divorce proceeding was\n                       subject to Hankins’ judgment lien. ................................. 18\n\n               2.      The Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement\n                       Agreement didn’t convey Norma’s interest in the\n                       Property to Roy because the parties indicated a\n                       future or prospective intent to convey, rather\n                       than a present intent, which was confirmed by\n                       their later actions. ...............................................................\n\n               3.      Sarah’s claim that the Marriage Settlement\n                       Agreement is an executory contract that vested\n                       Roy with equitable title on the date the Divorce\n                       Decree is flat wrong. ........................................................ 24\n\n       C.      Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that the\n               automatic bankruptcy stay applied to the execution\n               sale. Even if it did, Court should return the parties to\n               the status quo. .......................................................................... 26\n\n               1.      Even if Norma conveyed her interest in the\n                       Property to Roy, that conveyance was void and\n                       thus, not part of the bankruptcy estate. .......................... 27\n\n\n\n\n                                                     ix\n\f     2.      Norma’s interest didn’t pass to Roy, and thus, her\n             interest in the Property was not a part of his\n             bankruptcy estate or subject to the automatic\n             stay. ................................................................................. 29\n\n     3.      Even if Norma’s interest in the Property were\n             subject to the automatic stay, the Court should\n             restore the parties to the status quo, revive\n             Hankins’ judgment, and revive his judgment and\n             execution liens................................................................. 33\n\n\nD.   Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n     Hankins executed on homestead property. Rather, the\n     evidence shows that Hankins executed on Norma’s\n     undivided, one–half interest in the Property, which she\n     had abandoned. ........................................................................ 36\n\n     1.      Limits on homestead protections do exist: The\n             homestead protection doesn’t protect property\n             interests that are not the debtor’s actual\n             homestead. ...................................................................... 36\n\n     2.      Norma possessed a vested homestead interest in\n             the Property that was separate and independent\n             from Roy’s interest. But she abandoned that\n             interest when she moved out of the home with no\n             intention of returning, with her abandonment\n             becoming effective on the date of her divorce. ............... 37\n\n     3.      Roy’s homestead interest in the Property could\n             not prevent the forced sale of Norma’s interest in\n             the Property......................................................................41\n\n     4.      Any claim by Sarah that Roy owned 100% of the\n             Property on the execution date and thus, this\n             interest protected the Property from the\n             execution sale would lack merit. ..................................... 46\n\n\n\n\n                                           x\n\f        E.      Sarah failed to establish any of adverse possession\n                claims as a matter of law. ......................................................... 47\n\n                 1.      Overview of adverse possession in Texas. ....................... 47\n\n                2.       A claimant seeking to adversely possess a co–\n                         tenant’s interest in land has a more onerous\n                         burden—the claimant must also prove clear,\n                         unequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation of\n                         the common title. ............................................................ 49\n\n                3.       At best, the earliest Sarah could have repudiated\n                         Hankins’ interest in the Property would have\n                         been March 8, 2005. ....................................................... 50\n\n                4.       Sarah’s alternative bases for establishing\n                         repudiation are also insufficient to establish\n                         repudiation as a matter of law......................................... 52\n\n                5.       Sarah cannot establish adverse possession under\n                         either the 10–year or 25–year limitation period\n                         because the applicable time periods have not yet\n                         elapsed............................................................................. 54\n\n                6.       Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                         possession under the 3–year limitation period as\n                         a matter of law. ................................................................ 55\n\n                7.       Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                         possession under the 5–year and 10–year\n                         limitation periods as a matter of law............................... 56\n\n        F.      Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n                Hankins’ counterclaims for conversion, partition, and\n                trespass to try title are barred as a matter of law. .................... 62\n\nConclusion and Prayer ................................................................................ 64\n\nCertificate of Service.................................................................................... 65\n\nCertificate of Compliance ............................................................................ 66\n\n                                                      xi\n\f                                              Appendix\n\nDecember 5, 2014 Summary Judgment Order........................................Tab 1\n\nMarch 26, 2015 Summary Judgment Order ..........................................

Defendant/Appellant,\nJohn Hankins claims an undivided one–half interest in real property\nlocated in Harris County, Texas that he asserts he acquired at a 1980\nexecution sale. Plaintiff/Appellee, Sarah Harris is the daughter of the\njudgment debtor. She claims that the execution sale is void on multiple\ngrounds. Harris also claims title to the entire fee simple through adverse\npossession.\n\nHarris’s live pleading is located in the record at 1 Supp. CR at 5–39.\nHankins’ live counterclaim for affirmative relief is located in the record at 1\nSupp. CR at 43–93.\n\nTrial Court:\n\nHonorable Joseph J. “Tad” Halbach, Jr.\n333rd Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas\n\nProceedings Below:\n\nHarris moved for summary judgment on her affirmative claims for relief\nand on Hankins’ counterclaims. The trial court granted both motions. (2\nSupp. CR at 1237–39, Appx. 1) (first MJS order); (CR at 215–16, Appx. 2)\n(second MSJ order). The trial court later rendered a final judgment. (CR at\n224–26, Appx. 3). In the final judgment, the trial court granted the\nfollowing declaratory relief: (1) Harris owns the entire fee simple interest in\nthe Property, (2) Hankins has no interest in the Property, (3) the purported\nConstable’s Sale of the Property is void, and (4) the Deed under Execution\nof September 29, 1980 is void.\n\n\n\n\n                                      xx\n\f                            Issues Presented\n\nIssue Presented Number One:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and\ndeclaring that John Hankins owns no interest in the Property.\n\nIssue Presented Number Two:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and\ndeclaring that Sarah owns the entire fee simple interest in the Property.\n\nIssue Presented Number Three:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and\nfinding that she adversely possessed Hankins’ interest in the Property.\n\nIssue Presented Number Four:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment on\nHankins’ counterclaims for conversion, partition, and trespass to try title.\n\nIssue Presented Number Five:\n\nIf the underlying execution sale is void, which Hankins disputes, the trial\ncourt erred by declining to put the parties back to the status quo.\n\n\n\n\n                                     xxi\n\f                Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      Hankins requests oral argument. This appeal involves important\nquestions regarding creditors’ rights, the breadth of the Texas homestead\nprotection, the applicability of the automatic bankruptcy stay, and the use\nof adverse possession to strip a judgment creditor of his interest in the only\nproperty remaining that could be used to satisfy a 1978 judgment. Thus,\nHankins believes that oral argument would assist the Court in resolving this\ncase.\n\n\n\n\n                                     xxii\n\fTO THE HONORABLE FIRST COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n                               Introduction\n\n      It is axiomatic that justice delayed is justice denied. John Hankins\n\nobtained a $600,000 judgment against Norma Harris after she attempted\n\nto ruin his career with slanderous accusations nearly 40 years ago. Today,\n\nHankins is still looking to collect on his judgment.\n\n      Hankins did execute on Norma’s non–exempt undivided one–half\n\ninterest in real property located in 1980. But Norma and her ex–husband,\n\nRoy, played the legal system in a desperate attempt to put Norma’s most\n\nsignificant asset out of the reach of her judgment creditor, Hankins. Norma\n\nand Roy tried and failed to secure a valid restraining order preventing\n\nHankins from executing on the Norma’s interest in the Property. Norma\n\nthen executed a fraudulent conveyance—Norma transferred her undivided\n\none–half interest in the Property to Roy the day before he filed for\n\nbankruptcy protection in an effort to cloak a non–exempt asset with the\n\nprotection of the bankruptcy court. Now, Sarah—Norma and Roy’s\n\ndaughter—is attempting to continue the family tradition and use the courts\n\nto deprive Hankins of the justice he has waited nearly 40 years to receive. If\n\nthis long–running dispute is to be finally decided once and for all, justice\n\ndemands that it should be decided by a trial on the merits, and not by the\n\n\n                                      1\n\fsummary disposition entered by the trial court. Summary judgment was\n\nimproper because Sarah failed to carry her burden to establish her right to\n\nthe same as a matter of law. Thus, a reversal is necessary and warranted.\n\n\n                                  Statement of Facts\n\n         A.     The Property\n\n         While there may be claims asserted by both parties for ancillary relief,\n\nthe heart of this matter is whether John Hankins owns an undivided one–\n\nhalf interest in certain real property with Sarah Harris, or whether Sarah1\n\nowns the property free and clear of Hankins’ claim. The Property is\n\ncurrently a vacant lot located at 2922 Bellaire Boulevard in Houston, Texas,\n\nlegally described as:\n\n                Lot Three (3) in Block Two (2) of West University\n                Place, an addition to the city of West University\n                Place in Harris County, Texas, according to the map\n                thereof recorded in Volume 444, Page 560 of the\n                Deed Records of Harris County, Texas.\n\n(See 1 Supp. CR at 7) (the “Property”).\n\n\n\n\n1   Hankins will address Sarah, Norma, and Roy Harris by the first names for clarity.\n                                              2\n\f      B.    Hankins sues Norma for slander and obtains a\n            judgment against her in 1978.\n\n      The genesis of this lawsuit is Hankins’ efforts to stop the\n\ninappropriate conduct of Dr. Roy Harris more than 45 years ago. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 484). In 1969, Hankins was an administrator at a hospital in\n\nHouston. (Id., ¶ 12). Roy was an anesthesiologist who held privileges at the\n\nsame hospital. (Id.). Hankins received numerous complaints from hospital\n\nstaff and patients involving Roy improperly touching patients under\n\nanesthesia. (Id.). For example, Roy was caught fondling a female patient’s\n\nbreasts during surgery and was also found lying in bed with female patients\n\nunder anesthesia. (Id.). Hankins asked Roy to voluntary relinquish his\n\nprivileges, which Roy agreed to do. (Id.).\n\n      Roy was married to Norma Harris, who was also a doctor. (1 Supp. CR\n\nat 484, ¶ 13). After word spread throughout the medical community that\n\nRoy had engaged in inappropriate behavior, Norma became enraged and\n\nwaged a personal vendetta against Hankins. (Id.). Specifically, in 1971,\n\nHankins accepted employment with a different hospital in Houston. (Id.).\n\nWhat Hankins didn’t know was that Norma was an investor and doctor at\n\nthis hospital. (Id.). Seizing upon an opportunity for revenge, Norma, along\n\nwith Roy and other co–conspirators, devised a scheme to slander Hankins.\n\n(Id.). Norma and her co–conspirators accused Hankins of stealing $10,000\n\n                                      3\n\ffrom the hospital and had him arrested for theft. (Id.). There was no\n\nevidence to support the charges, and they were later dropped and\n\nexpunged. (Id.).\n\n      Hankins later filed a lawsuit for slander against Norma, among\n\nothers. (1 Supp. CR at 484–85, ¶ 15). The case was tried to a jury, which\n\nunanimously found that Norma had falsely and maliciously accused\n\nHankins of stealing from the hospital. (Id. at 485, ¶ 15). In February 1978, a\n\njudgment for $600,000 was rendered against Norma and in favor of\n\nHankins.2 (Id.; see also, (1 Supp. CR at 291–93 (Appx. 4)). Roy was not a\n\nparty to the judgment. (Id.). It is undisputed that Hankins abstracted his\n\njudgment against Norma in 1978. (1 Supp. CR at 485, ¶ 16; 2 Supp. CR at\n\n1213). Norma’s efforts to overturn the judgment on appeal were\n\nunsuccessful. (1 Supp. CR at 485, ¶¶ 17–18).\n\n      C.     Norma moves out of the Property with the intention of\n             not returning, and Roy files for divorce.\n\n      While Norma’s appeals of the judgment against her were pending, her\n\nmarriage to Roy was ending. Roy and Norma stopped living together as\n\nhusband and wife on or about March 7, 1980, with Roy filing for divorce 10\n\ndays later. (2 Supp. CR at 1148, 1213).\n\n2 Adjusted for inflation, a $600,000 judgment in February 1978 would today be\nequivalent to $2.193 million. See Bureau of Labor Statistics, CPI Inflation Calculator,\navailable at http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm, last visited October 6,\n2015.\n                                          4\n\f      At the time the divorce was filed, Norma had vacated the Property\n\nand moved to Brownsville. (Id. at 1127–29). And Norma, at least between\n\nthe time she separated from Roy in March 1980 and her September 2, 1980\n\npost–judgment deposition, did not intend to return to the Property. (2\n\nSupp. CR at 1113–15). Specifically, Norma testified in her deposition with\n\nregard to her living situation as follows:\n\n            Q.    Let me ask it this way: Is it not now your\n                  intention and hasn’t it been your intention\n                  since the time you separated from Dr. Roy to\n                  move back into the 2922 Bellaire Boulevard\n                  house as soon as possible?\n\n            A.    You mean after I was divorced?\n\n            Q.    Yes.\n\n            A.    No.\n\n            Q.    And even before?\n\n            A.    No.\n\n            ***\n            Q.    Now, in spite of all that, do you still maintain\n                  and contend that it’s not your intention to\n                  move back into that house as your home?\n\n            A.    No, I have no intention of that.\n\n\n            Q.    You have no intention of moving back?\n\n            A.    I can’t.\n\n\n                                       5\n\f(2 Supp. CR at 1113–15).\n\n         Roy and Norma were divorced on June 20, 1980. (1 Supp. CR at 378–\n\n82 (Appx. 5)). As part of the divorce, Roy and Norma entered into a\n\nMarriage Settlement Agreement, which allegedly addressed the disposition\n\nof the Property. (1 Supp. CR at 383–402 (Appx. 6)). The Marriage\n\nSettlement Agreement stated that Roy “shall have and own [the Property]\n\nas his separate property.” (Id. at 385). The Marriage Settlement Agreement\n\nalso provided the following that “[t]itle to the house shall be transferred to\n\nand vested solely in Husband as his separate property[,]” and in return,\n\n“Husband agrees to pay Wife the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars,” which\n\nwould be evidenced by a promissory note. (Id. at 387–88). There is no\n\nevidence that Roy ever paid Norma for the Property. (See 2 Supp. CR at\n\n1131).\n\n         D.   After Norma abandons her undivided one–half\n              interest in the Property, Hankins obtains a writ of\n              execution, which eventually leads to Norma’s interest\n              in the Property being levied.\n\n         Shortly after Norma divorced Roy and abandoned her undivided\n\none–half interest in the Property, Hankins requested a writ of execution\n\nand requested that the constable levy upon this interest, which the\n\nconstable did on August 6, 1980. (2 Supp. CR at 1145 (Appx. 7); id. at 426\n\n(Appx. 8)). Later, on September 2, 1980, the constable sold all of Norma’s\n\n                                      6\n\f“estate, right, title, and interest” in the property. (Id.). Hankins was the\n\nwinning bidder at the execution sale, which was completed at 10:30 a.m. (2\n\nSupp. CR at 1154; id. at 489, ¶ 32). Hankins later received an execution\n\ndeed, which conveyed to him “all of the estate, right, title, and interest” that\n\nNorma had in the Property. (Id.).\n\n        E.   Norma and Roy devise a scheme to put Norma’s\n             undivided one–half interest out of the reach of her\n             judgment creditor, Hankins.\n\n        After receiving notice of the constable’s sale, and without Hankins’\n\nknowledge, Norma and Roy sprang into action to prevent the execution\n\nsale.\n\n        Norma and Roy first applied for an ex parte restraining order to\n\nprevent Hankins and the constable from executing on Norma’s undivided\n\none–half interest in the Property. (1 Supp. CR at 185, ¶ 14). The application\n\nwas filed on Roy and Norma’s behalf by Matthew Hoffman’s firm, which\n\nrepresented Norma in the divorce proceeding earlier that year. (Id. at 375–\n\n77, 474 (Appx. 9)). The court granted the temporary restraining order on\n\nAugust 29, 1980. (Id. at 474–76). But the order did not, inter alia, state the\n\nhour of issuance, define the injury, state why any harm or injury would be\n\nirreparable, or state why the order was granted without notice. (Compare\n\nid. with Tex. R. Civ. P. 680.) The court did set a bond in the amount of\n\n\n                                       7\n\f$50,000. (Id. at 476). But Norma and Roy never paid the bond, and thus,\n\nthe clerk never issued a writ. (2 Supp. CR at 876).\n\n      After failing in their attempt to get a valid and enforceable injunction,\n\nRoy and Norma then attempted to put Norma’s undivided interest in the\n\nProperty out of the reach of Hankins’ levy by having Norma convey her\n\ninterest to Roy. (1 Supp. CR at 478–80 (Appx. 10)). Specifically, Norma\n\nexecuted a Special Warranty Deed on September 1, 1980, in which she\n\nconveyed to Roy “the entirety of [her] right, title, and interest in and to” the\n\nProperty, which would have been her undivided one–half interest. (Id. at\n\n478). The Deed was executed on September 1, 1980 and filed the next day\n\nat 9 a.m. (Id. at 476–78). Roy also gave Norma a Deed of Trust to secure a\n\npromissory note in the amount of $50,000, which represented the\n\npurchase price. (1 Supp. CR at 146–50 (Appx. 11); see id. at 387–88)\n\n(divorce decree stated that Roy was to pay Norma $50,000 for her\n\nundivided interest in the property, to be evidenced by a promissory note).\n\n      Roy filed for bankruptcy on September 2, 1980 at 8:06 a.m. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 186, ¶ 16). Roy listed Norma as a creditor on his bankruptcy schedule,\n\nand he listed the $50,000 he allegedly owed Norma for the Property, as\n\nevidenced by a vendor’s lien and deed of trust that had been executed the\n\nday before. (1 Supp. CR at 425 (Appx. 12); id. at 146–50). Roy received a\n\n\n                                       8\n\ffinal discharge from the bankruptcy court on May 19, 1981. (1 Supp. CR at\n\n436 (Appx. 14)). Later that spring, Norma moved back into the Property\n\nand reconciled with Roy. (See 2 Supp. CR at 957–58).\n\n     F.    Throughout the years, the parties exchange multiple\n           letters and engage in discussions regarding the\n           Property and Hankins’ desire to liquidate the same.\n\n     Following the execution sale and bankruptcy proceeding, things\n\nbetween Hankins and the Harris family apparently cooled off. The next\n\nspecific activity that anyone took with regard to the Property, at least what\n\nis in the record, was Roy conveying whatever interest he owned in the\n\nProperty to Sarah in March 1984. (1 Supp. CR at 187, ¶ 20); id. at 287–88\n\n(Appx. 15)). But Roy and Norma remained in possession of the Property, as\n\nSarah stated in her interrogatory answers that she “had an informal\n\narrangement to rent the Property to [her] mom and dad, off and on, from\n\n1984 to 2005.” (2 Supp. CR at 1143, Interrogatory No. 10).\n\n     After Roy conveyed his interest in the Property to Sarah, he\n\napparently received a letter from an attorney representing Hankins. Roy\n\nagain retained Hoffman to send a response. (See 1 Supp. CR at 407–14\n\n(Appx. 16)). Hoffman allegedly wrote a letter to Hankins’ attorney in July\n\n1984. (Id.). In his letter, Hoffman referred to Roy as “our client.” (Id.at\n\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\f407). The letter was also sent to Roy and Norma. (Id. at 416). Sarah was not\n\ncopied on the letter, nor was she mentioned in the letter. (Id.).\n\n      As to the substance of Hoffman’s letter, he stated that it was his\n\nclients’ position that Hankins’ execution deed was void because of the\n\ntemporary restraining order and the automatic bankruptcy stay. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 407–14). Specifically, Hoffman represented that “Mr. Hankins has no\n\nlegitimate interest” in the Property. (Id. at 408). But neither Norma nor\n\nRoy owned any interest in the Property when this letter was allegedly sent\n\nin July 1984. (1 Supp. CR at 187, ¶ 20; see also, id. at 150–51). Hankins\n\nasserts that he never received Hoffman’s July 1984 letter. (2 Supp. CR at\n\n1159, ¶ 4). Nor does Hankins know if his attorneys received Hoffman’s July\n\n1984 letter. (Id. at 941).\n\n      In 1990, Hankins found another attorney to help him in his effort to\n\nliquidate his interest in the Property. On September 7, 1990, Hoffman\n\nwrote Hankins’ counsel again. (1 Supp. CR at 416–38 (Appx. 17). Hoffman\n\nwrote this letter in response to a conference call he had with Hankins’ new\n\nattorney, during which Hoffman ascertained that “Hankins has come to you\n\n[Hankins’ new counsel] with the thought that he may now have some action\n\nagainst our client, Dr. Norma Harris … .” (Id. at 416). Hoffman then\n\nrepresented that certain documents attached to the letter would show that\n\n\n                                      10\n\fHankins didn’t have any “viable further cause of action.” (Id.). Hoffman\n\nrepresented that Roy’s bankruptcy discharge prevented Hankins from\n\n“taking any action to recover a debt, if any, incurred by the debtor prior to\n\nthe initiation of the bankruptcy case.” (Id. at 417). Specifically, Hoffman\n\nclaimed that the discharge order “forbids any judicial action on any claims\n\nMr. Hankins may have had against Dr. Roy Harris, the Chapter 7 Debtor.”\n\n(Id.). Hoffman’s letter concludes with him stating “[w]e have discussed this\n\nmatter with Dr. Norma Harris, who is outraged by your client’s attempt …\n\nto reopen [this matter.]” (Id. at 418). Neither Norma nor Roy owned the\n\nproperty when the 1990 letter was allegedly sent to Hankins. (2 Supp. CR at\n\n983; see also, 1 Supp. CR at 150–51).\n\n     On October 6, 1992, Sarah purportedly conveyed the interest in the\n\nProperty she received from her father in March 1984 back to him. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 160–62). In 1996, Roy again conveyed whatever interest he had in the\n\nproperty back to Sarah. (Id. at 163–64).\n\n     In 2005, as at least a partial owner of the Property, Sarah retained\n\nThomas McCaffrey to respond to another letter issued by Hankins’\n\nattorney. (1 Supp. CR at 439; 441–72). On March 8, 2005, McCaffrey\n\nmerely resent Hoffman’s letters, the attachments to the 1990 letter, and a\n\nletter from Hankins’ attorney in 1984. (Id. at 441–72 (Appx. 18)).\n\n\n                                        11\n\fMcCaffrey didn’t claim that Sarah was repudiating Hankins’ interest in the\n\nproperty, nor does he state why he sent the letter. (Id. at 439–72).\n\n      G.    Harris files this lawsuit to declare Hankins’ undivided\n            one–half interest in the Property void.\n\n      Sarah sued Hankins and sought a declaratory judgment that: (1) she\n\nowns a fee simple interest in the Property, (2) Hankins owns no interest in\n\nthe Property, and (3) Hankins’ execution sale is void. (1 Supp. CR at 13,\n\n¶27). Sarah also asserted a claim to quiet title and a claim for adverse\n\npossession. (Id. at 13–14, ¶¶ 28–36).\n\n      Hankins filed a counterclaim, asserting, inter alia, a trespass to try\n\ntitle claim and a request that the property be partitioned. (1 Supp. CR at\n\n43–93).\n\n      H.    Sarah moves for summary judgment on                        her\n            affirmative claims and Hankins’ counterclaims.\n\n      Sarah filed two motions for summary judgment. (1 Supp. CR at 180–\n\n508; 2 Supp. CR at 1240–55). Sarah’ first motion for summary judgment\n\naddressed her affirmative claims, while her second motion addressed\n\nHankins’ counterclaims. (Id.).\n\n      In her first motion for summary judgment, Sarah asserted the\n\nfollowing four grounds: (1) Hankins’ execution deed is void because the\n\nconstable executed on homestead property, (2) Hankins’ execution deed is\n\n\n                                        12\n\falso void because the execution sale violated the automatic stay created by\n\nRoy’s bankruptcy filing, (3) Hankins owns no interest in the Property\n\nbecause Norma didn’t own an interest at the time of the time of the levy and\n\nexecution sale, and (4) even if Hankins had an interest in the Property,\n\nSarah adversely possessed that interest under the 3, 5, 10, and 25–year\n\nlimitations periods. (Id. at 190–99).\n\n      The trial court granted Sarah’s motion for summary judgment on her\n\nclaims for declaratory judgment, action to quiet title, and adverse\n\npossession. (2 Supp. CR at 1237–39 (Appx. 1)). The trial court didn’t specify\n\nwhy it granted Sarah’s motion for summary judgment nor did it specify the\n\ngrounds on which the motion was granted. (Id.).\n\n      In her second motion for summary judgment, Sarah claimed, inter\n\nalia,3 that Hankins’ claim for conversion failed as a matter of law. (2 Supp.\n\nCR at 1240–55). Specifically, Sarah claimed that Hankins’ conversion claim\n\nfailed because he allegedly never obtained any interest in the Property and\n\nthus, he was never a co–tenant. (Id. at 1244). Sarah didn’t move for\n\nsummary judgment on Hankins’ claims for trespass to try title or partition\n\nin this second motion for summary judgment. (Id. at 1240–55).\n\n\n\n3 Hankins is not appealing the trial court’s grant of Sarah’s motion for summary\njudgment on his claims for unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel, or his request\nfor declaratory relief.\n                                        13\n\f      The trial court signed a second summary judgment order on March\n\n26, 2015, in which the court granted both of Sarah’s motions for summary\n\njudgment and granted the same relief. (CR at 215–16 (Appx. 2)). Again, the\n\ntrial court didn’t specify its reasons for granting Sarah’s motions for\n\nsummary judgment. (Id.). The trial overruled Hankins’ objections and\n\nspecial exceptions to both of Sarah’s motions for summary judgment. (CR\n\nat 227 (Appx. 19)).\n\n      A final judgment was rendered on April 27, 2015. (CR at 226–27\n\n(Appx. 13)). The final judgment declared the following: (1) Sarah owns the\n\nentire fee simple interest in the Property, (2) Hankins owns no interest in\n\nthe Property, (3) the execution sale is void, and (4) Hankins’ execution deed\n\nis void. (Id.).\n\n                      Summary of the Argument\n\n      The trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary\n\njudgment and declaring that John Hankins owns no interest in the\n\nProperty, and the trial court erred in declaring that Sarah owns the entire\n\nfee simple interest in the Property. Hankins asserts that he properly\n\nexecuted on Norma’s undivided one–half interest in the Property, which\n\nshe had abandoned as her homestead. Norma’s interest in the Property\n\nwasn’t subject to the automatic stay triggered by Roy’s bankruptcy filing, as\n\n\n                                     14\n\fany purported conveyance to Roy would be void. Regardless, at a\n\nminimum, Hankins still has perfected judgment and execution liens on the\n\nProperty that could not been affected by the bankruptcy proceeding. Thus,\n\nSarah failed to establish as a matter of law that Hankins owns no interest in\n\nthe Property, and she failed to establish as a matter of law that she owns the\n\nfee simple interest in the Property free and clear of his interest or liens.\n\n      The trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary\n\njudgment and finding that she adversely possessed Hankins’ interest in the\n\nProperty. Sarah failed to establish any of her adverse possession claims as a\n\nmatter of law. Sarah’s 3–year claim fails because she failed to establish a\n\nchain of title from the sovereign. Sarah’s 10–year and 25–year claims have\n\nnot yet ripen because the earliest possible date she could have repudiated\n\nHankins’ co–tenancy interest would have been March 8, 2005. And with\n\nregard to her 5–year and 10–year claims, Sarah failed to establish as a\n\nmatter of law the required elements of actual, visible, continuous, and\n\nuninterrupted use, and failed to establish as a matter of law the requisite\n\ncultivation, use, and enjoyment of the Property that is necessary to\n\nadversely possess against a co–tenant.\n\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\f      For many of the same reasons, the trial court erred in granting\n\nSarah’s motion for summary judgment on Hankins’ counterclaims for\n\nconversion, partition, and trespass to try title.\n\n      And finally, if the Court is to determine that the execution sale is void,\n\nthe Court should reinstate the status quo and allow Hankins to either revive\n\nhis judgment and execution liens or recognize their continued validity.\n\n\n                          Argument & Authorities\n\n      A.     This Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment\n             de novo.\n\n      Appellate courts review a trial court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Merriman v. XTO Energy, Inc., 407 S.W.3d 244, 248 (Tex. 2013).\n\nTraditional motions for summary judgments under Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 166a are reviewed in accordance with the following standards:\n\n            the movant for summary judgment has the burden of showing\n             that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he or she\n             is entitled to judgment as a matter of law;\n\n            in deciding whether or not there is a disputed material fact\n             issue precluding summary judgment, evidence favorable to the\n             non–movant will be taken as true; and\n\n            every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of the\n             non–movant and any doubts resolved in his or her favor.\n\nSee Buck v. Palmer, 381 S.W.3d 525, 527 (Tex. 2012).\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f      The question on appeal is not whether the summary judgment proof\n\nraises a fact issue, but whether the summary judgment proof establishes as\n\na matter of law that there is no genuine issue of a material fact as to one or\n\nmore of the essential elements of the plaintiff's cause of action. Fort Worth\n\nOsteopathic Hosp., Inc. v. Reese, 148 S.W.3d 94, 99 (Tex. 2004). An\n\nappellate court reviewing a summary judgment must consider whether\n\nreasonable and fair-minded jurors could differ in their conclusions in light\n\nof all of the evidence presented. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mayes, 236\n\nS.W.3d 754, 765 (Tex. 2007).\n\n      B.    Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n            Hankins owns no interest in the Property. At a\n            minimum, Hankins’ judgment and execution liens\n            attached to the Property and are still valid.\n\n      Sarah claims that she is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw because Norma owned no interest in the Property as of June 17, 1980.\n\n(1 Supp. CR at 194–95). Thus, Sarah claims that when Hankins attempted\n\nto execute on Norma’s interest on September 2, 1980, there was no interest\n\nfor him to execute upon. (1 Supp. CR at 194–95). Sarah bases this claim on\n\nthe Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement Agreement entered into by\n\nRoy and Norma. Sarah claims that these documents conveyed whatever\n\ninterest Norma had in the Property to Roy as of June 17, 1980. (1 Supp. CR\n\nat 194). Sarah is wrong for several reasons.\n\n                                      17\n\f            1.    Even if the Divorce Decree and Marriage\n                  Settlement    Agreement    constitute a valid\n                  conveyance (they do not), any interest Roy\n                  acquired during the divorce proceeding was\n                  subject to Hankins’ judgment lien.\n\n      Any interest Roy obtained from Norma—either at the time the\n\nDivorce Decree was rendered in June 1980 or when Norma gave him the\n\nSpecial Warranty Deed in September 1980—was subject to Hankins’\n\njudgment lien, which Hankins perfected in 1978.\n\n      Filing and recording an abstract of judgment creates a judgment lien\n\nas to a judgment debtor’s real property. TEX. PROP. CODE § 52.001; Gordon\n\nv. West Houston Trees, Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 32 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2011, no pet.) (citing Won v. Fernandez, 324 S.W.3d 833, 834–35 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.). The purpose of an abstract of\n\njudgment is to: (1) create a judgment lien in the first place, and (2) provide\n\nnotice to subsequent purchasers of that lien’s existence. Gordon, 352\n\nS.W.3d at 38. Thus, when an abstract of judgment is properly recorded and\n\nindexed, it creates a judgment lien that is superior to the rights of\n\nsubsequent purchasers and lien holders. Id. at 39. Thus, it is axiomatic that\n\nif a judgment lien properly attaches to real property, a subsequent\n\npurchaser of that property purchases it subject to the judgment lien. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                     18\n\f      Also, a valid levy creates an execution lien on the debtor’s property in\n\nfavor of the judgment creditor. Gordon, 352 S.W.3d at 39; Won, 324\n\nS.W.3d at 835. A judgment lien and an execution lien work together so that\n\n“[i]f a judgment creditor obtains a judgment lien and then executes on the\n\njudgment, the date of the execution lien relates back to the date of the\n\njudgment lien, thereby giving the judgment creditor priority over other\n\ncreditors with claims arising after the date of the judgment lien.” Gordon,\n\n352 S.W.3d at 39 (quoting Won, 324 S.W.3d at 835, n. 3).\n\n      Here, it is undisputed that Hankins filed and recorded his abstract of\n\njudgment in 1978. (1 Supp. CR at 485, ¶ 16; 2 Supp. CR at 1213). Shortly\n\nafter Norma divorced Roy and abandoned her undivided one–half interest\n\nin the Property,4 Hankins requested a writ of execution and requested that\n\nthe constable levy on Norma’s interest in the Property, which the constable\n\ndid on August 6, 1980. (1 Supp. CR at 403; id. at 426). Thus, Hankins’\n\njudgment lien was perfected in 1978 by the filing and recording of his\n\nabstract of judgment, and his execution lien was perfected on August 6,\n\n1980 when the levied was issued. Hankins’ liens on Norma’s property were\n\nsuperior to the rights of any subsequent purchasers, including Roy.\n\n4 Norma moved out of the home before the divorce was filed, and after the divorce was\nfinal, she had no intention of returning to the Property. Thus, Norma abandoned her\nhomestead interest in the Property. As a result of her abandonment, Hankins’ judgment\nlien attached to her undivided one–half interest in the Property. This will be discussed\nin more detail in § D–2.\n                                          19\n\fGordon, 352 S.W.3d at 39. Thus, any interest Roy may have acquired from\n\nNorma in 1980 was subject to Hankins’ judgment lien. Id. So, even if\n\nNorma conveyed her interest to Roy in 1980, Hankins’ lien was still valid\n\nand superior—Norma could not escape the effect of Hankins’ judgment lien\n\nby merely conveying her interest in the Property. Id.\n\n           2.    The Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement\n                 Agreement didn’t convey Norma’s interest in the\n                 Property to Roy because the parties indicated a\n                 future or prospective intent to convey, rather\n                 than a present intent, which was confirmed by\n                 their later actions.\n\n     Sarah claims that Roy acquired all of Norma’s interest in the Property\n\nthrough the Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement Agreement. Sarah is\n\nwrong because the Marriage Settlement Agreement, incorporated into the\n\nDivorce Decree, reflected Norma’s and Roy’s intent to effect a future\n\ntransfer of Norma’s interest in the Property, as opposed to an immediate\n\ntransfer. This intent is evidenced by the language of the Marriage\n\nSettlement Agreement and Norma and Roy’s actions in the months that\n\nfollowed, which culminated with Norma’s execution of a Special Warranty\n\nDeed. Therefore, Roy didn’t acquire Norma’s interest in the Property\n\nthrough the divorce proceeding.\n\n     Conveyance by deed requires delivery of the deed. TEX. PROP CODE\n\n§5.021; In Marriage of Merrikh, No. 14–14–00024–CV, 2015 WL 2438770\n\n                                     20\n\fat *6 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] May 19, 2015, pet. filed) (citing Noell\n\nv. Crow–Billingsley Air Park Ltd. P'ship, 233 S.W.3d 408, 415 (Tex. App.–\n\nDallas 2007, pet. denied). Delivery of a deed has two elements: (1) the\n\ngrantor must place the deed within the control of the grantee (2) with the\n\nintention that the instrument becomes operative as a conveyance. In\n\nMarriage of Merrikh, 2015 WL 2438770 at *6; Noell, 233 S.W.3d at 415.\n\nThe question of delivery of the deed is controlled by the intent of the\n\ngrantor, and it is determined by examining all the facts and circumstances\n\nbefore, during, and after the execution of the instrument. Stephens County\n\nMuseum, Inc. v. Swenson, 517 S.W.2d 257, 262 (Tex. 1974). Generally, title\n\nto transferred property vests upon execution and delivery of the deed. Id. at\n\n261. Proof that a deed has been recorded gives rise to a presumption that\n\nthe grantor delivered the deed with the intent to convey the property\n\naccording to the terms of the deed. Id. at 261–62.\n\n     As an initial matter, there is no evidence that either the Divorce\n\nDecree or Marriage Settlement Agreement was recorded with the Harris\n\nCounty real property records, much less before Norma’s interest was levied\n\non August 6, 1980. (1 Supp. CR at 378–82; id. at 383–402). In fact, neither\n\nthe Divorce Decree nor the Marriage Settlement Agreement could have\n\nbeen filed as a deed because neither document was attested to under the\n\n\n                                     21\n\fhand and seal of the clerk for the court that rendered the judgment. (Id.);\n\nsee TEX. PROP. CODE § 12.013 (2) (“A judgment of a court may be recorded if\n\nthe judgment is attested under the signature and seal of the clerk of the\n\ncourt that rendered the judgment.”) (effective January 1, 1984).5\n\n      Regardless of whether the Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement\n\nAgreement were recorded or recordable, neither constituted a conveyance,\n\nas evidenced by the parties’ intent and actions before and after their\n\nexecution of the Marriage Settlement Agreement. Specifically, Norma’s and\n\nRoy’s actions indicate that they did not intend for either the Divorce Decree\n\nor the Marriage Settlement Agreement to operate as a conveyance of\n\nNorma’s interest.\n\n      First, the Marriage Settlement Agreement specifically stated that\n\n“[t]itle to the house shall be transferred to and vested solely in [Roy] as his\n\nseparate property.” (1 Supp. CR at 387–88). Likewise, in return for Norma\n\nconveying her title to the house, Roy “agree[d] to pay [Norma] the sum of\n\n$50,000” that was to be evidenced by a promissory note in the same\n\namount. Id. These phrases—“shall be,” and “agrees to pay”—indicate a\n\nfuture, or prospective, intent to convey and assign rather than a present\n\n\n5 The predecessor statute in effect in 1980, Article 6635 Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes,\nwas substantially similar: “County clerks shall record all judgments and abstracts of\njudgments rendered by any court of this State presented to him for record when attested\nunder the hand and seal of the clerk of the court where such judgment was obtained.”\n                                          22\n\fintention. See, e.g., Commercial Structures and Interiors, Inc. v. Liberty\n\nEduc. Ministries, Inc., 192 S.W.3d 827, 833 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006,\n\nno pet.) (The use in the assignment of phrases such as “agree to convey”\n\nand “agrees to assign” by themselves indicate a future, or prospective,\n\nintent to convey and assign rather than a present intention.); Chambers\n\nCounty v. TSP Development, Ltd., 63 S.W.3d 835, 839 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (real estate contract language that\n\nstated “Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to buy” was prospective,\n\nsuggesting that the actual sale may take place in the future but is not being\n\neffectuated by the present contract itself.); Allodial Ltd. P’ship v. North Tex.\n\nTollway Auth., 176 S.W.3d 680, 683 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied)\n\n(that provision indicating that party “shall assign over to Allodial all rights”\n\ndue from causes of action did not effect a present assignment of those\n\nrights). Thus, the Marriage Settlement Agreement failed to evidence a\n\npresent intent to become immediately operative as a conveyance. (See 2\n\nSupp. CR at 1132) (Roy gave his deposition a month after the divorce was\n\nfinal and testified that the deed of Norma’s interest to him was “in the\n\nprocess”).\n\n      Second, Norma and Roy later executed a deed of trust, promissory\n\nnote, and special warranty deed. (1 Supp. CR at 478–80; (1 Supp. CR at\n\n\n                                      23\n\f146–50). If Norma and Roy believed that the Divorce Decree and Marriage\n\nSettlement Agreement constituted a conveyance of Norma’s interest, there\n\nwould not have been any need for them to later execute a deed of trust or a\n\nspecial warranty deed.\n\n      Third, Norma and Roy’s attorney, Matthew Hoffman, later\n\nrepresented that Norma “transferred her undivided fifty percent (50%)\n\ninterest in the Homestead Property to Roy Harris by Special Warranty\n\nDeed, pursuant to the above–mentioned June 20, 1980 Divorce Decree.”\n\n(Id. at 410). So, some four years after the rendition of the Divorce Decree,\n\nNorma’s and Roy’s attorney admitted that the Special Warranty Deed was\n\nexecuted pursuant to the divorce decree. (Id.). So, Roy didn’t acquire\n\nNorma’s undivided one–half interest in the Property through the Divorce\n\nDecree and Marriage Settlement Agreement.\n\n            3.    Sarah’s claim that the Marriage Settlement\n                  Agreement is an executory contract that vested\n                  Roy with equitable title on the date the Divorce\n                  Decree is flat wrong.\n\n      Sarah also sheepishly claimed in a footnote that, under the divorce\n\ndecree, Roy obtained equitable title to Norma’s share of the Property\n\nbecause the decree purportedly operated as executory contract. (1 Supp. CR\n\nat 195, n. 8). Sarah is wrong again.\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\f      An executory contract for the sale of real estate contemplates that the\n\npurchaser will complete performance in the future, that is, finishing making\n\npayments before title to the property passes. See Morton v. Nguyen, 412\n\nS.W.3d 506, 509–10 (Tex. 2013) (emphasis added) (“A contract for deed,\n\nunlike a typical secured transaction involving a deed of trust, is a financing\n\narrangement that allows the seller to maintain title to the property until the\n\nbuyer has paid for the property in full.)”; see also, Smith v. Davis, 462\n\nS.W.3d 604, 609 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2015, pet. denied) (unlike a traditional\n\nmortgage, an executory contract allows the seller to retain title to the\n\nproperty until the purchaser had paid for the property in full).\n\n      This is not the case here. Under the Marriage Settlement Agreement,\n\nthe transfer of Norma’s title was not contingent on Roy paying the entire\n\npurchase price. (1 Supp. CR at 387–88). Instead, Norma and Roy agreed\n\nthat “title to the house shall be transferred” to Roy, and more important,\n\nthey agreed that “[i]n return for the disposition of this asset to [Roy], [Roy]\n\nagrees to pay [Norma] the sum of … $50,000 … .” (Id.; see 2 Supp. CR at\n\n1132) (Roy gave his deposition a month after the divorce was final and\n\ntestified that the deed of Norma’s interest to him was “in the process”).\n\nThus, the Marriage Settlement Agreement was not an executory contract\n\nbecause Norma and Roy didn’t contemplate a future transfer of title upon\n\n\n                                      25\n\fthe payment of the full purchase price. (Id.). Thus, unlike a typical\n\nexecutory contract, where title is transferred in the future upon the full\n\npayment of the purchase price, Roy could obtain Norma’s legal title under\n\nthe Marriage Settlement Agreement before paying the purchase price.\n\n     Also, Sarah’s claim that the Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement\n\nAgreement constitute an executory contract is puzzling in light of the deed\n\nof trust executed by Roy. In an executory contract, a purchaser who goes\n\ninto possession has equitable title, with the seller holding legal title. See\n\nJohnson v. Wood, 157 S.W.2d 146, 148 (Tex. 1941); see also, Morton, 412\n\nS.W.3d at 509–10. Conversely, in a deed of trust, the seller, i.e., Norma,\n\nretains equitable title, while the buyer, Roy, acquires legal title. Flag–\n\nRedfern Oil Co. v. Humble Exploration Co., 744 S.W.2d 6, 8 (Tex. 1987).\n\nSo, Norma didn’t convey equitable title to Roy, as would be the case with an\n\nexecutory contract, but rather she actually conveyed legal title to Roy,\n\nsubject, of course, to Hankins’ judgment lien.\n\n     C.    Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that the\n           automatic bankruptcy stay applied to the execution\n           sale. Even if it did, Court should return the parties to\n           the status quo.\n\n     Sarah next claims that the execution sale, and any interest Hankins\n\nacquired at the sale, is void because of the automatic bankruptcy stay\n\ntriggered by Roy’s bankruptcy filing. (1 Supp. CR at 193 (citing 11 U.S.C. §\n\n                                     26\n\f362(a)). Specifically, Sarah claims that Roy’s bankruptcy petition triggered\n\nan automatic stay that prevented the execution sale from going forward—\n\neven though the execution sale only involved Norma’s “estate, right, title,\n\nand interest” in the Property. In other words, because Roy owned at least\n\nan undivided one–half interest in the Property, this ownership interest and\n\nthe bankruptcy stay prevented any execution sale from going forward\n\nagainst Norma’s “estate, right, title, and interest” in the Property, despite\n\nthe fact that Norma wasn’t a bankruptcy debtor or a debtor’s spouse. Sarah\n\nis wrong because the purported transfer from Norma to Roy is void and of\n\nno effect under then existing Texas law. But even if Sarah were correct,\n\nHankins’ judgment and execution liens are still valid, which presents the\n\nCourt with an opportunity to restore the status quo.\n\n            1.    Even if Norma conveyed her interest in the\n                  Property to Roy, that conveyance was void and\n                  thus, not part of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n      At the time of Norma’s attempted conveyance to Roy, the conveyance\n\nwas void under Texas law and passed no title. Sections 24.02 and 24.03 of\n\nthe Business and Commerce Code in effect in 1980 dictated that all\n\nfraudulent conveyances were void. TEX. BUS. COM. CODE §§ 24.02, 24.03\n\n(Vernon 1968) (Acts 1967, 60th Leg., vol. 2, p. 2619, ch. 785, § 4, eff. Sept. 1,\n\n1967) (attached as Appx. 20). Specifically, § 24.02(a) provided that a\n\n\n                                       27\n\ftransfer of real property “is void with respect to a creditor” if the transfer\n\n“was intended to (1) delay or hinder any creditor, purchaser, or other\n\ninterested person from obtaining that to which he is, or may become,\n\nentitled, or (2) defraud any creditor, purchaser, or other interested person\n\nof that to which he is, or may become, entitled.” Id. at § 24.02 (a) (1–2); see\n\nalso, Texas Sand Co. v. Shield, 381 S.W.2d 48, 54 (Tex. 1964).\n\n      The Supreme Court of Texas construed substantially similar language\n\nand held that fraudulent conveyances are void as to the fraudulent grantor’s\n\ncreditors. Eckert v. Wendel, 40 S.W.2d 796, 797 (Tex. 1931). Thus, any\n\nfraudulent conveyance as to creditors is void as to such creditors. Texas\n\nSand Co. v. Shield, 381 S.W.2d 48, 54 (Tex. 1964). As a result, the Supreme\n\nCourt stated:\n\n            It necessarily follows that the legal as well as the\n            equitable title remains in the debtor for the purpose\n            of satisfying debts. Thus, when the creditor obtains\n            a judgment against the debtor, and properly records\n            and indexes an abstract of judgment, the creditor\n            acquires a lien upon the land just as though no\n            transfer had been made.\n\nId.\n\n      Here, Sarah was required to show that Norma’s interest passed to Roy\n\nthrough a valid conveyance as a matter of law. She failed to do so and\n\ncannot do so. Norma’s conveyance to Roy, her ex–husband at the time, was\n\n\n                                      28\n\fin fraud of her creditor, Hankins. The facts in the record show that Norma\n\nand Roy attempted to obtain a restraining order to stop the sale, but failed\n\nto obtain a valid restraining order, much less pay the bond established by\n\nthe court. When the restraining order route didn’t work, Norma next tried\n\nto convey her interest in the Property to Roy the day before he filed for\n\nbankruptcy (and listed the promissory note he owed to Norma as a debt on\n\nhis schedules). There is no evidence he ever paid the purchase price or the\n\nnote). Thus, there was a clear intent to shelter Norma’s interest in the\n\nProperty from her judgment creditor. These acts reek of fraud. This\n\nfraudulent conveyance, under Sections 24.02 and 24.03 of the Business &\n\nCommerce Code then in effect in 1980, rendered Norma’s conveyance to\n\nRoy void. Eckert, 40 S.W.2d at 797; Texas Sand Co., 381 S.W.2d at 54.\n\nTherefore, Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that Norma’s\n\nconveyance to Roy was legally valid. And if Norma’s conveyance was void,\n\nthen her purported conveyance to Roy passed no title that could become\n\npart of his bankruptcy estate.\n\n           2.    Norma’s interest didn’t pass to Roy, and thus, her\n                 interest in the Property was not a part of his\n                 bankruptcy estate or subject to the automatic\n                 stay.\n\n     As discussed above, Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n\nNorma’s conveyance to Roy was valid. Therefore, Sarah cannot establish as\n\n                                    29\n\fa matter of law that Norma’s interest in the Property was subject to the\n\nautomatic stay because if Norma’s interest didn’t pass to Roy, her separate\n\ninterest in the Property did not become part of his bankruptcy estate.\n\n          Generally, the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates a bankruptcy\n\nestate under § 541 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. § 541.6 And all\n\nproperty of the bankruptcy estate is subject to the automatic stay provision\n\nof § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n          But the automatic stay doesn’t apply to a non–debtor’s interest in\n\nproperty jointly owned with a debtor, unless the property is community\n\nproperty. For example, § 541(a)(1) states that “all legal or equitable\n\ninterests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case” is\n\nproperty of the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). This section doesn’t\n\napply to any legal or equitable interests of non–debtors. Id. In other words,\n\nNorma’s separate, undivided one–half interest in the Property was not a\n\npart of Roy’s bankruptcy estate. Id. This is confirmed by other sections of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code.\n\n          Under § 363 of the Code,7 if certain conditions exist, “the trustee may\n\nsell both the estate’s interest … and the interest of any co–owner in\n\n\n6 Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code in effect on September 1, 1980 is substantially\nsimilar to Section 541 in effect today. A copy of the 1978 Code is attached as Appx. 21.\n\n7   Id.\n                                          30\n\fproperty in which the debtor had, immediately before the commencement\n\nof the case, an undivided interest as a tenant in common, joint tenant, or\n\ntenant by the entirety.” 11 U.S.C. § 363(h). So, § 363(h) of the Code\n\nrecognizes the separate interests of the bankruptcy estate and non–debtor\n\nco–owners in jointly owned property. Id. This claim is further solidified by\n\n§ 363(j) of the Code, which states that, “[a]fter a sale of property to which [§\n\n363(h)] applies, the trustee shall distribute to the debtor’s spouse or the\n\nco–owners of such property, as the case may be, and to the estate, the\n\nproceeds of such sale, … according to the interests of such spouse or co–\n\nowners, and of the estate.” Id. § 363 (j). Thus, a non–debtor’s interest in\n\nproperty that he jointly owns with a bankruptcy debtor is not a part of the\n\ndebtor’s bankruptcy estate. Id.\n\n      Hankins’ position is supported by the caselaw, as courts have held\n\nthat real property held as joint tenants by spouses is not community\n\nproperty that would be included in one spouse’s separate bankruptcy estate.\n\nSee In re Berry, 295 B.R. 385, 393–94 (D. N.M. 2003); see also, In re\n\nSummers, 332 F.3d 1240, 1242–44 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n      And Hankins’ position is supported by the bankruptcy judge’s ruling\n\non Roy’s motion for recognition of the automatic stay. On the day he filed\n\nfor bankruptcy, Roy filed a motion for recognition of the automatic stay\n\n\n                                       31\n\fwith the bankruptcy court. That afternoon, the bankruptcy court granted\n\nRoy’s motion for recognition of the automatic stay. (1 Supp. CR at 433). But\n\nthe bankruptcy judge modified Roy’s proposed order, and ordered the\n\nfollowing:\n\n             It is therefore, ORDEDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\n             DECREED that the scheduled Constable Sale of the\n             real property located at 2922 Bellaire Boulevard,\n             Houston, Texas, or any interest therein owner the\n             Debtor is prohibited by the automatic stay …, and\n             that any further attempt to execute on the Debtor’s\n             property outside of the Bankruptcy Court … is\n             stayed pursuant to the provisions of Section 362\n             during the pendency of this case.\n\n(1 Supp. CR at 433) (additions by bankruptcy court emphasized).\n\n     As the Court can see, the bankruptcy court’s decision—that Norma’s\n\ninterest in the Property was not subject to the automatic stay—is in line\n\nwith Hankins’ assertion: Norma’s interest in the Property was not part of\n\nthe bankruptcy estate nor was it subject to the automatic stay because she\n\nowned a separate interest in joint property and was not the debtor or the\n\ndebtor’s spouse. Therefore, Hankins’ execution on Norma’s interest in the\n\nProperty was proper.\n\n\n\n\n                                     32\n\f           3.    Even if Norma’s interest in the Property were\n                 subject to the automatic stay, the Court should\n                 restore the parties to the status quo, revive\n                 Hankins’ judgment, and revive his judgment and\n                 execution liens.\n\n     Even if the bankruptcy stay were in effect and reached to Norma’s\n\nundivided one–half interest in the Property, there is no evidence that the\n\nbankruptcy discharge invalidated Hankins’ judgment lien or his execution\n\nlien on Norma’s undivided one–half interest in the Property. Nor is there\n\nany evidence that Roy’s bankruptcy discharge invalidated his levy on\n\nNorma’s interest in the Property. Therefore, even if the automatic stay\n\napplied and voided the execution sale, which Hankins disputes, Hankins’\n\njudgment and execution liens are still valid and enforceable.\n\n     In 1975, the Texas Legislature amended Title 90 of the Revised Civil\n\nStatutes of Texas by adding Article 5449(a), titled “Discharge of judgments\n\nand judgment liens against bankrupts.” Under Article 5449(a), §§ 1 and 4,\n\nRoy’s bankruptcy discharge would have invalidated Hankins’ judgment and\n\nexecution liens only if underlying judgment at issue was against Roy. TEX.\n\nREV. CIV. STAT. art. 5449(a) §§ (1, 4) Act of June 19, 1975, 64th Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 396, §§ 1, 4, 1975 Tex. Gen. Laws 1030, (Attached as Appx. 22)\n\n(emphases added) repealed by Act of 1983, 68th Leg., R.S., ch. 576, § 6,\n\n1983 Tex. Gen. Laws 3729, 3730. But Roy wasn’t the judgment debtor;\n\n\n                                     33\n\fNorma was the judgment debtor. (1 Supp. CR at 291–93). And it is\n\nundisputed that Norma never filed for bankruptcy protection. Because Roy\n\nwasn’t the judgment debtor, his discharge could not wipe out Hankins’ liens\n\nunder then–existing Texas law. TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. art. 4459(a)(1, 4). So,\n\nHankins’ judgment and executions liens, and the levy, are still in effect and\n\nenforceable.\n\n      Additionally, under settled Texas law, an execution lien is effective\n\nfrom the time of the levy and continues in effect until it is lost or\n\nabandoned, or in some way ceases to have vitality and effect. Texas\n\nEmployer’s Ins. Ass’n v. Engelke, 790 S.W.2d 93, 95 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1990, no writ) (citing Borden v. McRae, 46 Tex. 396, 400 (Tex.\n\n1877)). In Borden, the Texas Supreme Court said: “By the levy, the land is\n\nsubject to the process of the court, and liable to sale for the satisfaction of\n\nthe plaintiff’s demand, and it thereby becomes subject to a lien or specific\n\ncharge for this purpose from the date of the levy, until it is lost or\n\nabandoned, or in some way ceases to have vitality or effect.” Id. Thus, even\n\nif the execution sale is set aside, Hankins’ execution lien, as evidenced by\n\nthe levy, would still be effective. Id.\n\n      Furthermore, it is widely held that upon setting aside an execution\n\nsale, all parties should be returned to status quo as far as possible. Keda\n\n\n                                          34\n\fDev. Corp. v. Stanglin, 721 S.W.2d 897, 902 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1986, no\n\nwrit) (citing House v. Robertson, 36 S.W. 251, 253 (1896)); see also,\n\nTownsend v. Smith, 20 Tex. 465, 470 (Tex. 1857) (if execution sale is void,\n\nthe judgment is revived and remains unsatisfied). For example, when an\n\nexecution sale is set aside, the purchaser is entitled to a return of the\n\npurchase money paid. Id. at 903 (citing Elam v. Donald, 58 Tex. 316 (Tex.\n\n1883)). If a purchaser at an execution sale were subject to losing not only\n\nthe property that he won at the sale, but also the money he paid for the\n\nproperty, this would have a chilling effect on bidding at execution sales and\n\nwould result in lower prices that would be against the interests of judgment\n\ndebtors and the public. Id. at 903. Thus, Hankins’ judgment should be\n\nrevived to the extent it was satisfied from the proceeds of the sale; and the\n\njudgment creditor should be entitled to interest on the revived judgment as\n\nif the sale had not been held. Robin Russell and James W. Paulsen, 1 TEX.\n\nPRAC. GUIDE CREDITORS RIGHTS § 10:174 (2015). Also, any set–aside should\n\nrevive any liens on the property that were extinguished by the sale and the\n\nliens reattach to the property, with the same priority and effect as if there\n\nhad not been a sale. Id.\n\n      Therefore, even if the automatic stay applied, Roy’s discharge had no\n\neffect on Hankins’ judgment and execution liens. Thus, the trial court erred\n\n\n                                     35\n\fin granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and determining that\n\nHankins has “no interest” in the Property. And if even the automatic stay\n\napplied to void the execution sale, the parties should be returned to the\n\nstatus quo, with Hankins’ liens revived.8\n\n      D.     Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n             Hankins executed on homestead property. Rather, the\n             evidence shows that Hankins executed on Norma’s\n             undivided, one–half interest in the Property, which\n             she had abandoned.\n\n      Sarah also claims that the execution sale and thus, Hankins’ title\n\nunder that sale, is void because Roy’s homestead protection as to his\n\nundivided one–half interest in the Property protected the entirety of the\n\nProperty from the execution sale. Sarah is wrong.\n\n             1.     Limits on homestead protections do exist: The\n                    homestead protection doesn’t protect property\n                    interests that are not the debtor’s actual\n                    homestead.\n\n      While Texas homestead rights are expansive, they are not unlimited.\n\nWhile the courts have always given a liberal construction to the constitution\n\n8 It is anticipated that Sarah will argue that Hankins’ liens cannot be revived because he\nreleased any claims he may have had against Norma and Roy. (1 Supp. CR at 234–35).\nBut Sarah expressly didn’t move for summary judgment on the release. (Id. at 189, fn.6).\nBut it is undisputed that the general release was executed on March 3, 1981, more than\ntwo months before Roy’s received his discharge from the bankruptcy court. (Id. at\n234–35; 412). There is no evidence in the record that indicates whether the money paid\nto Hankins was not property of Roy’s bankruptcy estate. Nor is there any evidence the\nbankruptcy trustee approved the settlement. Under Sarah’s logic, such a transaction is\nvoid because it allegedly violated the automatic bankruptcy stay. Thus, if the Court were\ninclined to void the execution sale and restore the status quo, it should set aside the\ngeneral release as well, revive Hankins’ liens, and place the parties back at square one.\n                                           36\n\fand statutes to protect the homestead rights, it is clear the courts cannot\n\nprotect that which is not homestead. Dominguez v. Castaneda, 163 S.W.3d\n\n318, 330 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005, pet. denied). Thus, while the courts\n\nconstrue homestead laws generously, they cannot unduly stretch the\n\nhomestead laws beyond their constitutional and statutory limits and\n\nprotect an interest that is not a homestead. Norris v. Thomas, 215 S.W.3d\n\n851, 854 (Tex. 2007). So, if Norma’s undivided one–half interest in the\n\nProperty was not her homestead at the time of the levy, her interest was\n\nthus subject to being levied and executed upon. See Womack Humphreys\n\nArchitects, Inc. v. Barrasso, 83 S.W.3d 211, 213 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2002,\n\nno pet.) (permitting a forced sale on spouse’s non–homestead interest in\n\nthe property, subject to the wife’s existing homestead right).\n\n            2.    Norma possessed a vested homestead interest in\n                  the Property that was separate and independent\n                  from Roy’s interest. But she abandoned that\n                  interest when she moved out of the home with no\n                  intention of returning, with her abandonment\n                  becoming effective on the date of her divorce.\n\n      Norma’s abandonment of the Property and later divorce allowed\n\nHankins’ liens to attach, and thus, her interest in the Property was subject\n\nto execution.\n\n      When more than one person owns an interest in homestead property,\n\nthere is a co–tenancy. See Laster v. First Huntsville Props. Co., 826 S.W.2d\n\n                                      37\n\f125, 131 (Tex. 1991) (holding that former wife’s interest in her homestead\n\nwas held in co–tenancy with a mortgagee who succeeded her former\n\nhusband’s 26.17% fee simple interest); Sayers v. Pyland, 161 S.W.2d 769,\n\n773 (Tex. 1942) (holding that it is “well–settled that, while one tenant in\n\ncommon may acquire homestead rights in the common property, the rights\n\nso acquired are not superior to the rights and remedies of the other joint\n\nowners.). Also, homestead rights “vest independently in each spouse\n\nregardless of whether one spouse, or both, actually owns the fee simple\n\ninterest in the homestead.” In re Rogers, 461 U.S. 677, 685 (1983). Here, it\n\nis undisputed that Norma had a homestead interest in her undivided one–\n\nhalf interest in the Property before March 1980. But once she abandoned\n\nthe homestead and got divorced, she lost that homestead interest.\n\n     Generally, a judgment lien that has been properly abstracted cannot\n\nattach to a homestead as long as the property remains homestead. Wilcox v.\n\nMarriott, 103 S.W.3d 469, 473 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied).\n\nProperty that has been designated as a homestead will only lose that\n\ncharacter through abandonment, death, or alienation. See Florey v. Estate\n\nof McConnell, 212 S.W.3d 439, 443–44 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet.\n\ndenied). Thus, if the judgment debtor abandons the homestead property,\n\nthe judgment lien attaches to the property. Wilcox, 103 S.W.3d at 473.\n\n\n                                    38\n\f     “To be an abandonment that would subject such property to seizure\n\nand sale, there must be a voluntary leaving or quitting of the residence with\n\na then present intent to occupy it no more as a home … .” Pierce v.\n\nWashington Mut. Bank, 226 S.W.3d 711, 715 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2007, pet.\n\ndenied) (quoting King v. Harter, 8 S.W. 308, 309 (Tex. 1888)). To show\n\nabandonment of one’s homestead interest, the party claiming abandonment\n\nmust show that the homestead claimant moved with the intention of not\n\nreturning to the property. See Taylor v. Mosty Bros. Nursery, Inc., 777\n\nS.W.2d 568, 569 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1989, no writ). But one spouse’s\n\nabandonment of the homestead does not expose the property to a forced\n\nsale because a homestead cannot be abandoned without the consent of the\n\nclaimant’s spouse—if the homestead claimant is married. TEX. PROP. CODE\n\n§41.004.\n\n     Here, Norma abandoned the Property. Roy and Norma stopped living\n\ntogether as husband and wife in March 1980. (2 Supp. CR at 1148).\n\nLikewise, Roy filed for divorce in March 1980. (Id. at 1148, 1213). At the\n\ntime the divorce was filed, Norma had vacated the Property and moved to\n\nBrownsville. (Id. at 1127–29). And Norma, at least between the time she\n\nseparated from Roy and her September 2, 1980 post–judgment deposition,\n\nhad moved to Brownsville with no intention of returning to the Property to\n\n\n                                     39\n\flive. (2 Supp. CR at 1113–15); Taylor, 777 S.W.2d at 569. Thus, as of the\n\ndate of the execution sale, Norma voluntarily left or quit the homestead,\n\nmoved to Brownsville, and did not intend to return to the Property to live.\n\nSee Pierce, 226 S.W.3d at 715. This constitutes an abandonment of Norma’s\n\nhomestead interest in the Property.\n\n     And Norma’s abandonment was effective on the date of divorce, June\n\n20, 1980. A similar abandonment issue involving a divorce was present in\n\nIn re Johnson. In Johnson, the court was “faced squarely with the issue of\n\nwhether two ex–spouses, both with fifty (50%) percent property interest in\n\na home, can each assert homestead rights even though both do not live in\n\nthe home. In re Johnson, 112 B.R. 15, 17 (E.D. Tex. 1990). Specifically, a\n\ndebtor was awarded a one–half interest in her marital home in her divorce\n\nproceeding, and the other one–half interest was awarded to her ex–\n\nhusband. Id. at 16. The debtor claimed that her one–half interest in the\n\nproperty was subject to the homestead protection even though she no\n\nlonger occupied the home. Id. The court disagreed. Id. The court held that\n\nthe ex–wife’s homestead interest in the marital home was lost as of the date\n\nshe (1) became divorced, and (2) ceased to occupy the home. Id. at 17.\n\n     The same result should apply here: Norma’s homestead interest in\n\nthe Property was lost as of date she (1) became divorced, and (2) abandoned\n\n\n                                      40\n\fthe Property. Therefore, as of June 20, 1980, the date of Norma’s divorce,\n\nshe no longer had a homestead interest in the Property, which dictates that\n\nHankins’ judgment lien attached to her undivided one–half interest and\n\nsubjected it to execution. Id.; see Wilcox, 103 S.W.3d at 473\n\n           3.    Roy’s homestead interest in the Property could\n                 not prevent the forced sale of Norma’s interest in\n                 the Property.\n\n     Sarah essentially claims that Roy’s undivided one–half interest in the\n\nProperty protected the entire Property from the execution sale. Sarah is\n\nwrong.\n\n     Again, homestead rights “vest independently in each spouse\n\nregardless of whether one spouse, or both, actually owns the fee simple\n\ninterest in the homestead.” In re Rogers, 461 U.S. 677, 685 (1983). And a\n\nclaimant’s homestead interest can extend only to the interest in the\n\nproperty that she owns. See Patterson v. First Nat’l Bank of Lake Jackson,\n\n921 S.W.2d 240, 246 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ)\n\n(stating that an ex–wife’s family homestead extends only to her\n\nproportional interest in the residence); Heggen v. Pemelton, 836 S.W.2d\n\n145, 150 (Tex. 1992) (stating “the homestead right extends only to the\n\nproportional interest of a former spouse with a present right of possession).\n\nThus, one’s homestead right in property can never rise any higher than the\n\n\n                                     41\n\fright, title, or interest that the claimant owns in the property. See Sayers v.\n\nPyland, 161 S.W.2d 769, 773 (Tex. 1942). This means that Roy’s homestead\n\nrights in his undivided one–half interest of the Property cannot operate to\n\nprotect the entire Property from an execution sale when the sale is limited\n\nto his ex–wife’s separate, abandoned, undivided one–half interest in the\n\nProperty.\n\n      The Eastland Court of Appeals agreed with Hankins’ position in\n\nBarrasso. There, the court of appeals held that a judgment creditor like\n\nHankins could foreclose on one spouse’s non–homestead interest in\n\nproperty, such as Norma’s, that was subject to the homestead protection of\n\nanother spouse, like Roy. Womack–Humphreys Architects, Inc. v.\n\nBarrasso, 83 S.W.3d 211, 213 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2002, no pet.).\n\nSpecifically, the husband purchased a house in Plano before he married his\n\nwife. Id. at 211–12. After the marriage, the wife moved into the house, but\n\nthe husband continued to reside overseas. Id. at 212. At some point, a\n\njudgment was taken against the husband. Id. The judgment creditor then\n\nsought to execute on its judgment, just as Hankins did in this case. Id. The\n\nwife obtained an injunction against the execution on the Plano property,\n\nclaiming that the property was her homestead, as Roy did in this case. Id.\n\nThe judgment creditor, as Hankins did in this case, responded by asserting\n\n\n                                      42\n\fthat it was merely executing against the husband’s interest in the property.\n\nId.; (see also, 1 Supp. CR at 403) (levy and execution lien was against all of\n\nNorma’s “estate, right, title, and interest” in the Property). The trial court\n\nissued an injunction stopping the sale. Id.\n\n      The court of appeals reversed. Barrasso, 83 S.W.3d at 213. While it\n\nwas unclear whether the husband had a homestead interest in the Plano\n\nhouse, the record established that the wife, as did Roy in this case, did have\n\na homestead interest. Id. at 212. But the court of appeals was not persuaded\n\nby this fact because the judgment creditor was not attempting to execute on\n\nthe wife’s homestead interest, but rather, the judgment creditor, like\n\nHankins here, was trying to execute on the husband’s non–homestead\n\ninterest. Id.; (see also, 1 Supp. CR at 403) (levy and execution lien was\n\nagainst all of Norma’s “estate, right, title, and interest” in the Property).\n\nThus, the court of appeals held that the judgment creditor was entitled to\n\nexecute on its judgment against the husband’s interest in the Plano house,\n\nsubject to the wife’s homestead interest in the property. Id. at 213. Like\n\nBarrasso, Hankins was authorized to execute on Norma’s separate,\n\nundivided one–half interest in the Property.\n\n      Sarah disagrees with this conclusion, relying on the Austin Court of\n\nAppeals’ decision in Fairfield Financial Group v. Synnott. In Synnott, the\n\n\n                                     43\n\fcouple purchased their homestead in 1984. Fairfield Fin. Group, Inc. v.\n\nSynnott, 300 S.W.3d 316, 319 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, no pet.). A\n\njudgment was taken against the husband and abstracted 1992. Id. The\n\nhusband moved out of the homestead in 1997 and filed for divorce. Id. In\n\nJanuary 1998, the husband executed an agreement incident to the divorce,\n\nthe court signed the parties’ divorce decree, and the husband conveyed his\n\nundivided one–half interest in the homestead to his ex–wife. Id.\n\n     The husband’s creditor asserted that he had abandoned the\n\nhomestead and thus, the judgment lien attached to the property. Id. at 321.\n\nThe Austin Court of Appeals disagreed. Id. The court determined that the\n\ntiming and effect of the husband’s actions “were irrelevant because the\n\nproperty remained at all relevant times protected by [ex–wife’s] undivided\n\nhomestead interest in the property.” Id. Thus, despite recognizing the fact\n\nthat a lien attaches to property when it loses its homestead character, the\n\ncourt held that homestead property is wholly exempt from the attachment\n\nof judgment lien (other than those specifically listed in the Property Code)\n\nso long as the remaining spouse retains her homestead interest. Id. This\n\ncannot be the law for two reasons.\n\n     First, if one spouse wants to make the conscious choice to voluntarily\n\nleave and abandon their separately vested homestead rights, as opposed to\n\n\n                                     44\n\fdeath, incarceration, or other involuntary disposition, that abandonment\n\nshould have consequences, including the attachment of liens that wouldn’t\n\notherwise attach. One spouse’s abandonment doesn’t reduce the other\n\nspouse’s separately vested homestead rights. See Sayers, 161 S.W.2d at 773\n\n(one’s homestead right in property can never rise any higher than the right,\n\ntitle, or interest that the claimant owns in the property). Conversely, by\n\nallowing the spouse in possession to enjoy not only her homestead rights,\n\nbut also the separately vested homestead rights of her spouse who\n\nabandoned the homestead, means that one spouse can acquire a homestead\n\ninterest greater than the proportional right, title, or interest she owns. This\n\nis not the law.\n\n      Second, the Synnott holding (and Sarah’s position in this case), taken\n\nto its logical extreme, means that as long as one person maintains an\n\ninterest in homestead property, no matter how fractional (e.g., 1%), that\n\nfractional interest is sufficient to protect the entire property. This is\n\nproblematic because it is ripe for abuse. No family or single adult is allowed\n\nto have two homesteads at the same time under Texas law. Silvers v. Welch,\n\n91 S.W.2d 686, 687 (Tex. 1936). But under Synnott, a debtor could easily\n\nput assets out of the reach of creditors by granting family members\n\nfractional shares in rental homes and then have those family members (or\n\n\n                                      45\n\ffriends, or trusted tenants, or confidants) claim the homestead protection\n\nfor each property. In other words, even though the debtor’s rental\n\nproperties are not his homestead, they would be still be protected from\n\nexecution if anyone could claim any homestead interest in a piece of\n\nproperty. This is an extreme example, but it is exemplar of the absurdity\n\nthat could arise. Again, if an individual makes a conscious decision to\n\nabandon his homestead, then that interest should be available to creditors.\n\n           4.    Any claim by Sarah that Roy owned 100% of the\n                 Property on the execution date and thus, this\n                 interest protected the Property from the\n                 execution sale would lack merit.\n\n     It is anticipated that Sarah will claim that Norma’s purported\n\nconveyance to Roy on September merged their separate homestead\n\ninterests into Roy, and thus, the Property was protected from being\n\nexecuted upon.\n\n     If there is a dispute between the purchaser of property at an execution\n\nsale and one who contends the property was not subject to sale by virtue of\n\nhomestead rights, the issue is to be determined with reference to the status\n\nof the property at the time the execution was levied. Ingle v. Lea, 8 S.W.\n\n325, 326 (Tex. 1888). Property is not subject to a forced sale if it was\n\nactually impressed with the homestead character at the time of the levy. Id.\n\nIf the claimant attempts to impress the homestead character on the\n\n                                     46\n\fproperty after the levy, the rights of the purchaser at the execution sale are\n\nsuperior. Baird v. Trice, 51 Tex. 555, 560 (Tex. 1879).\n\n      Here, on the date of the levy, August 6, 1980, Norma’s undivided\n\none–half interest in the Property was not her homestead. As discussed\n\nabove, Norma abandoned the homestead by moving to Brownsville with the\n\nintent of not returning, and this abandonment was effective on June 20,\n\n1980, the date her divorce was finalized. And as of the date of the levy,\n\nNorma had not yet conveyed or tried to convey her interest in the Property.\n\nSo, as of the date of the levy, Norma’s separate undivided one–half interest\n\nin the Property was not homestead and thus, it was subject to execution.\n\nAny attempt after the date of the levy to attach the homestead protection to\n\nNorma’s separate, undivided one–half interest in the Property is\n\nineffective. Ingle, 8 S.W. at 326.\n\n      E.    Sarah failed to establish any of adverse possession\n            claims as a matter of law.\n\n      Harris also claims that even if Hankins had an interest in the\n\nProperty, she adversely possessed that interest. Again, Sarah is wrong—she\n\nfailed to establish her claim of adverse possession as a matter of law.\n\n            1.    Overview of adverse possession in Texas.\n\n      The doctrine of adverse possession is based on statutes of limitation\n\nfor the recovery of real property. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 16.021–\n\n                                      47\n\f037. Thus, if there is a dispute concerning the possession of real property,\n\nthe rightful owner of the property must file suit within a specified period of\n\ntime (3, 5, 10, or 25 years, depending on various statutory factors and\n\nconditions) or be barred from recovering the property. Id. Not only are\n\nsuits for recovery of possession by the rightful owner barred, adverse\n\npossession provisions operate to vest the adverse claimant with title to the\n\nproperty. Id. at § 16.030(a). Thus, “[t]he concept of adverse possession\n\nallows a person to claim title to real property presently titled in another.”\n\nSession v. Woods, 206 S.W.3d 772, 777 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006, pet.\n\ndenied) (emphasis in original).\n\n     To prove a claim for adverse possession, a claimant must establish six\n\nelements: (1) actual possession of the disputed property, (2) that is open\n\nand notorious, (3) that is peaceable, (4) under a claim of right, (5) that is\n\nadverse or hostile to the claim of the owner, and (6) consistent and\n\ncontinuous for the duration of the statutory period. Dyer v. Cotton, 333\n\nS.W.3d 703, 710 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n     Due to the harsh nature of disenfranchising someone of title\n\notherwise rightfully held, establishing title by adverse possession is not\n\nwell–regarded in the law, and the statutory prerequisites must be strictly\n\ncomplied with. Wells v. Johnson, 443 S.W.3d 479, 488 (Tex. App.—\n\n\n                                     48\n\fAmarillo, pet. denied) (citing Thomas v. Southwestern Settlement & Dev.\n\nCo., 131 S.W.3d 31, 34 (Tex. Civ. App.—Beaumont 1939, writ dism’d,\n\njudgment correct)).\n\n           2.    A claimant seeking to adversely possess a co–\n                 tenant’s interest in land has a more onerous\n                 burden—the claimant must also prove clear,\n                 unequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation of the\n                 common title.\n\n     Generally, a co–tenant may not adversely possess against another co–\n\ntenant unless it clearly appears that he has repudiated the title of his co–\n\ntenant and is holding adversely to him. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118\n\nS.W.3d 742, 750 (Tex. 2003) (citing Todd v. Bruner, 365 S.W.2d 155, 156\n\n(Tex. 1963)). Thus, where a co–tenancy is involved, an adverse possession\n\nclaimant has a more onerous burden of proof. Sebesta v. Daniels, 812\n\nS.W.2d 641, 645 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied). This\n\nis because possession by a co–tenant is presumed to be in right of common\n\ntitle. Id. (citing Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160. A co–tenant may claim adversely\n\nto another co–tenant only if he has repudiated the co–tenancy and notice of\n\nsuch repudiation has been brought home to the other co–tenant. Id. (citing\n\nTodd, 365 S.W.2d at 160). Notice of repudiation must be clear, unequivocal,\n\nand unmistakable. Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160. Notice of repudiation is\n\nrequired before the statutory period begins to run. Tex–Wis Co. v. Johnson,\n\n\n                                    49\n\f534 S.W.2d 895, 900 (Tex. 1976); McLaren v. Beard, 811 S.W.2d 564, 568\n\n(Tex. 1991).\n\n               3.   At best, the earliest Sarah could have repudiated\n                    Hankins’ interest in the Property would have\n                    been March 8, 2005.\n\n      As discussed above, if Hankins acquired an interest in the Property,\n\nhe acquired Norma’s one–half undivided interest in the Property. Thus,\n\nHankins was a co–tenant or joint owner of the Property. So, in order for\n\nSarah to adversely possess Hankins’ interest, Sarah was required to prove—\n\nas a matter of law—that she or her predecessor clearly, unequivocally, and\n\nunmistakably repudiated Hankins’ interest in the common title to the\n\nProperty. Todd, 365 S.W.3d at 160; Dyer, 333 S.W.3d at 713. The statutory\n\nperiod does not begin to run on Sarah’s adverse possession claims until she\n\nshows she clearly, unequivocally, and unmistakably repudiated Hankins’\n\ninterest. Tex–Wis, 534 S.W.2d at 900.\n\n      At best, the earliest Sarah could have repudiated Hankins’ interest\n\nwould have been March 8, 2005, as discussed below. Yet, Sarah points to\n\ntwo letters written by her parents’ attorneys as evidence of repudiation of\n\nHankins’ title. Neither of these letters establishes that Sarah repudiated\n\nHankins’ interest as a matter of law on the dates they were sent. Neither the\n\nJuly 1984 letter nor the September 1990 letter can constitute—as a matter\n\n\n                                     50\n\fof law—a clear, unequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation by Sarah of\n\nHankins’ interest in the Property. See Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160. Sarah is not\n\nmentioned in either the July 1984 letter or the September 1990 letter. (1\n\nSupp. CR at 407–14; id. at 416–38). Nor is there any evidence that Matthew\n\nHoffman ever represented Sarah. Thus, Sarah cannot claim she repudiated\n\nHankins’ title as a matter of law through either letter.\n\n      Nor can Sarah claim that she can tack on her parents’ period of\n\nalleged adverse possession to her alleged period of possession. For tacking\n\nto be effective, Roy and Norma must have met all the requirements of\n\nadverse possession at the time they allegedly repudiated Hankins’ interest\n\nin the Property. BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Marshall, 342 S.W.3d 59, 69 (Tex.\n\n2011); TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 16.023. They failed to do so because\n\nthey were not co–tenants with Hankins at the time the July 1984 and\n\nSeptember 1990 letters were sent; Sarah was Hankins’ co–tenant. Sarah\n\ncould only tack on Norma and Roy’s alleged adverse possession to her\n\nclaimed period of possession if Roy or Norma owned the Property at the\n\ntime the letters were sent and then conveyed their interest to Sarah. But it\n\nis undisputed that neither Roy nor Norma owned any interest in the\n\nProperty when these two letters were sent, and thus, they cannot constitute\n\na repudiation of Hankins’ title by Sarah as a matter of law.\n\n\n                                      51\n\f      At best, Sarah can claim she repudiated Hankins’ title in March 2005,\n\nwhen she retained Thomas McCaffrey to send a letter to Hankins. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 439; 441–72). McCaffrey merely resent Hoffman’s letters, the\n\nattachments to the 1990 letter, and a letter from Hankins’ attorney in 1984.\n\n(Id. at 441–72). McCaffrey didn’t claim that Sarah Harris was repudiating\n\nHankins’ interest in the property, nor does he state why he sent the letter.\n\n(Id. at 439–72). Thus, the March 2005 letter doesn’t establish a clear,\n\nunequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n            4.    Sarah’s alternative bases for establishing\n                  repudiation are also insufficient to establish\n                  repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n      Sarah also claims two alternative bases for establishing repudiation of\n\nHankins’ interest in the Property. Neither basis establishes the requisite\n\nclear, unequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation of common title as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n      Sarah claims repudiation because her family’s possession had been\n\n“so long continued, open, notorious, exclusive, and inconsistent with the\n\nexistence of title” in Hankins that there is an inference of notice. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 198). Harris cited no evidence in support of this claim. (Id.).\n\nRegardless, this alternative basis doesn’t apply in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                      52\n\f      In Tex–Wis, the Texas Supreme Court held that a “jury [may] infer\n\nnotice of a repudiation without any change in the use of the land,” if there\n\nhas been “long–continued use.” Tex–Wis Co. v. Johnson, 534 S.W.2d 895,\n\n899 (Tex. 1976); see also, Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Pool, 124\n\nS.W.3d 188, 194 (Tex. 2003). Thus, it is not necessary that actual notice of\n\nthe adverse claim be given; it is sufficient if constructive notice is given, and\n\nconstructive notice will be presumed where the facts show that the adverse\n\noccupancy and claim of title to the land involved has been long continued,\n\nopen, notorious, exclusive, and inconsistent with the existence of title in the\n\ndefendant. Pool, 124 S.W.3d at 194. Thus, “[l]ong–continued possession\n\nand assertion of claim by one tenant with nonclaim on the part of one out of\n\npossession has always been regarded as a strong circumstance tending to\n\nauthorize an inference of notice of the adverse possession.” Id. at 195\n\n(quoting Moore v. Knight, 94 S.W.2d 1137, 1139–40 (Tex. 1936)).\n\n      In this case, Harris cites no evidence in support of her claim that her\n\nfamily’s possession had been “so long continued, open, notorious, exclusive,\n\nand inconsistent with the existence of title” in Hankins that there is an\n\ninference of notice. (1 Supp. CR at 198). Regardless, it is undisputed that\n\nHankins consistently asserted claims to the Property—that is why the\n\nHarris family continually hired attorneys to refute his claims. (See 1 Supp.\n\n\n                                       53\n\fCR at 407–14; id. at 416–38; id. at 439; 441–72). Thus, Sarah failed to\n\nestablish this alternative basis for repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n      Sarah also claimed that repudiation was established by her accepting\n\na deed purporting to convey to her the fee simple interest in the Property. (1\n\nSupp. CR at 198). This Court recently rejected a similar claim. Dyer v.\n\nCotton, 333 S.W.3d 703, 711 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.)\n\n(the party claiming adverse possession, who owned a 1/7 undivided interest\n\nin the property, could not rely on an erroneous deed conveying the entire\n\nfee simple estate to him as evidence of repudiation as to the other co–\n\ntenants). Thus, any purported fee simple conveyance to Sarah after\n\nHankins acquired his title cannot establish repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n            5.    Sarah cannot establish adverse possession under\n                  either the 10–year or 25–year limitation period\n                  because the applicable time periods have not yet\n                  elapsed.\n\n      If the March 8, 2005 letter was a repudiation of Hankins’ title and\n\nthus, constitutes the accrual date for Sarah’s adverse possession claims, her\n\nclaims under the 10–year and 25–year limitation periods must fail because\n\nthose periods of possession haven’t lapsed.\n\n      Again, at best, the earliest Sarah could claim she repudiated Hankins’\n\ntitle would be March 8, 2005, when McCaffrey sent his letter to Hankins’\n\nattorney. (1 Supp. CR at 238). Thus, her claim for adverse possession under\n\n                                      54\n\fthe 10–year and 25–year limitation periods would not ripen until March 8,\n\n2015, and March 8, 2030, respectively. But once possession of real property\n\nis interrupted by an adverse suit to recover the property, the requisite\n\npeaceable possession no longer exists. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§16.021(3). In this case, Sarah filed suit on January 13, 2014—before the\n\n10–year and 25–year limitation periods had expired. (CR at 4–15). And\n\nHankins filed his counterclaim on February 4, 2014—also before the 10–\n\nyear and 25–year limitation periods had expired. (Id. at 16–40). Thus,\n\npeaceable possession was interrupted, and as such, Sarah did not (and\n\ncould not) establish her claim for adverse possession as a matter of law\n\nunder either the 10–year or 25–year limitation periods.\n\n            6.    Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                  possession under the 3–year limitation period as\n                  a matter of law.\n\n      The 3–year statute of limitation states the suit “to recover real\n\nproperty held by another in peaceable and adverse possession under title or\n\ncolor of title” must be brought “not later than three years after the day the\n\ncause of action accrues.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 16.024. “Title” is\n\ndefined as a regular chain of transfers of real property from or under the\n\nsovereignty of the soil. Id. at § 16.024. The chain is said to be under “color\n\nof title” when the chain is complete, but necessarily perfect, but not\n\n\n                                     55\n\f“wanting of intrinsic fairness or honesty.” Id. at § 16.021. Therefore, to\n\nprevail under the 3–year limitation period, Sarah was required to prove—as\n\na matter of law—title from the sovereignty. Id. Sarah wholly failed to do so.\n\n(1 Supp. CR at 179–508). Therefore, Sarah failed to establish her claim for\n\nadverse possession under the 3–year limitation period regardless of when\n\nshe allegedly repudiated Hankins’ interest in the Property.\n\n            7.    Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                  possession under the 5–year and 10–year\n                  limitation periods as a matter of law.\n\n       The 5–year limitation period requires the owner to bring suit within\n\nfive years to recover property held by another in peaceable and adverse\n\npossession who cultivates, uses, or enjoys the property, pays taxes, and\n\nclaims under a duly registered deed. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§16.025(a). The 10–year statute of limitation requires suit “to recover real\n\nproperty held in peaceable and adverse possession by another who\n\ncultivates, uses, or enjoys the property.” Id. at §16.026(a). Thus, both\n\nlimitation periods require that the adverse possession claimant cultivate,\n\nuse, or enjoy the land. Sarah failed to establish this element as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       Here, Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that she cultivated,\n\nused, or enjoyed the land in a manner that was (1) actual and visible, (2)\n\n\n                                      56\n\fcommended and continued under a claim of right that is inconsistent and\n\nhostile to the claim of another person, and (3) continuous and not\n\ninterrupted. Sarah failed to establish these elements as a matter of law.\n\n      As an initial matter, the evidence is disputed with regard to whether\n\nSarah’s possession was actual, visible, continuous, and uninterrupted.\n\nPossession of the claimed property must also be consistent and continuous,\n\nuninterrupted by temporary vacancy, unless duration of vacancy is\n\nreasonable under existing circumstances that reasonably show the adverse\n\nclaimant did not thereby intend to abandon the premises. Wells, 443\n\nS.W.3d at 490 (citing Grayson v. Dunn, 581 S.W.2d 785, 788 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Waco 1979, writ ref’d)). Sporadic, irregular, and occasional use of\n\nland does not satisfy the requirements of adverse possession. See Jones v.\n\nFord, 583 S.W.2d 821 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1979, writ ref’d n.r.e.)\n\n(quoting Vaughan v. Anderson, 495 S.W.2d 327, 332 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nTexarkana 1973, writ ref’d n.r.e.)). Even regular and consistent use every\n\nyear for the statutory period is insufficient if there are substantial periods of\n\ntime when the land is not in actual use. Id. (quoting Vaughan, 495 S.W.2d\n\nat 332). If the evidence shows breaks in possession, the court cannot\n\nassume those breaks to have been of such short duration as not to defeat\n\nthe requisite continuity of possession. Vaughan, 495 S.W.2d at 333. If there\n\n\n                                       57\n\fis a break in the continuity of possession, it is the adverse possession\n\nclaimant’s burden to show that the breaks only existed for a reasonable\n\nperiod. Dunn v. Taylor, 102 Tex. 80, 85 (1908).\n\n     Sarah has lived in Washington D.C. since 2005, and thus, it is\n\nreasonable to assume that she has spent most of the last 10 years in\n\nWashington, D.C., and not in Texas. (2 Supp. CR at 1144, Interrogatory No.\n\n15). Also, Roy passed away in 1999, and Norma passed away in 2005. (1\n\nSupp. CR at 260–61). Thus, neither Roy nor Norma has been in actual,\n\nvisible, continuous, and uninterrupted possession of the Property since\n\nMarch 8, 2005. And Hankins testified that, despite visiting the Property\n\n“hundreds of times,” he has never seen Roy, Norma, or Sarah at the\n\nProperty nor did ever see any signs that someone was occupying the\n\nProperty. (2 Supp. CR at 1158, ¶ 3; (2 Supp. CR at 937–38). Therefore,\n\nSarah failed to establish as a matter of law that her possession was actual,\n\nvisible, open, continuous, and uninterrupted.\n\n     Nor does Sarah’s evidence of cultivation, use, and enjoyment of the\n\nProperty establish her adverse possession claim as a matter of law. Again,\n\nthe earliest Sarah could claim she repudiated Hankins’ title would have\n\nbeen March 8, 2005. Thus, her period of alleged adverse possession could\n\nnot begin until March 8, 2005. Tex–Wis, 534 S.W.2d at 900; McLaren, 811\n\n\n                                    58\n\fS.W.2d at 568. So, her alleged evidence regarding Roy’s alleged occupancy\n\nof the Property through his death in 1999 and Norma’s alleged occupancy\n\nof the Property through her death in 2005 is insufficient to establish\n\nadverse possession under either the five–year or ten–year limitation\n\nperiod. Simply, neither Roy nor Norma were alive and thus, able to use the\n\nProperty for the statutorily required period after Sarah’s alleged\n\nrepudiation. And anything they did or may have done before Sarah\n\nallegedly repudiated Hankins’ interest in March 2005 is legally irrelevant\n\nand insufficient.\n\n      Nor    does   Sarah’s    alleged evidence      of maintaining     utilities,\n\nmaintaining insurance, having discussions to sell the Property, making\n\nimprovements on the Property, or landscaping and maintaining the\n\nProperty constitute cultivation, use, and enjoyment of the Property that\n\nwould give a co–tenant such Hankins’ notice of her adverse possession\n\nclaim for several reasons.\n\n      First, the maintaining of utilities, keeping the property insured,\n\nmaking      improvements      on   the   property,   and   performing   general\n\nmaintenance is, without more, legally insufficient to establish an adverse\n\npossession claim against a co–tenant. In Todd, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nheld that “if the acts of the respondents and their predecessors in title are\n\n\n                                         59\n\fsusceptible of explanation consistent with the existence of the common title\n\nthen such acts cannot … give constructive notice to the co–tenants out of\n\npossession.” Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160. Instead, adverse claimant must\n\nprove actual or constructive notice of the ouster, and the clear, unequivocal,\n\nand unmistakable repudiation of the common title. Todd, 365 S.W.2d at\n\n160; Dyer, 333 S.W.3d at 713. Sarah’s usage of the Property is nothing more\n\nthan merely undertaking and performing tasks consistent with a co–\n\ntenancy, which is insufficient to establish adverse possession as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       Second, merely paying the taxes on property and attempting to find\n\nbuyers for the property have been deemed insufficient to establish an\n\nadverse possession claim. See Jones v. Ford, 583 S.W.2d 821, 824 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—El Paso 1979, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Even if one co–tenant pays taxes on\n\nthe entire property, possession coupled with payment of taxes is not notice\n\nto a co–tenant of repudiation of common title. Sebesta, 812 S.W.2d at 645\n\n(citing Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160).\n\n       Third, Sarah’s alleged landscaping and maintenance of the Property is\n\nlikewise insufficient to establish an adverse possession claim as a matter of\n\nlaw. The Supreme Court of Texas has held that the mere cutting of weeds is\n\ninsufficient to constitute use of property to meet the requirements for\n\n\n                                     60\n\fadverse possession. City of Dallas v. Etheridge, 253 S.W.2d 640, 643 (Tex.\n\n1952). Nor does the occasional cutting of timber. Kirby Lumber Corp. v.\n\nLindsey, 455 S.W.2d 733, 741 (Tex. 1970). Nor does the cutting of burs and\n\npoisonous weeds because the cutting and gathering of a natural crop\n\ndoesn’t constitute adverse possession. McDonald v. Weinacht, 465 S.W.2d\n\n136, 143–44 (Tex. 1971); see also, Bywaters v. Gannon, 686 S.W.2d 593,\n\n595 (Tex. 1985) (if mowing the grass and planting flowers does not\n\nconstitute evidence of a hostile character of possession sufficient to give\n\nnotice to an exclusive adverse possession, neither does maintaining a\n\nhedge).\n\n      Fourth, Sarah’s evidence of cultivation, use, and enjoyment is weak\n\nand fails to establish her adverse possession claim as a matter of law. As an\n\ninitial matter, Hankins objected to the invoices and bills attached as Exhibit\n\nNumbers 2, 8, and 9 to Sarah’s affidavit because these documents were not\n\nauthenticated and because they were hearsay. (2 Supp. CR at 867, 870).\n\nThe court overruled the objections. (CR at 227). This was error, as Sarah\n\nfailed to authenticate these documents or lay any foundation for their\n\nadmissibility. Thus, they are inadmissible hearsay that must be excluded.\n\nEven if the Court were to consider these documents, they fall short of\n\n\n\n\n                                      61\n\festablishing actual, visible, open, and continuous possession of the\n\nProperty for the statutory limitation periods.\n\n      Here, the insurance statements attached by Sarah to her motion for\n\nsummary judgment were for the policy period of March 31, 2006 through\n\nMarch 31, 2007. (1 Supp. CR at 241–45). Sarah attached no other insurance\n\nstatements, certificates, or policies for any other year of her claimed\n\nadverse possession. (Id.). Likewise, the “utility bills” Sarah attached to her\n\nmotion for summary judgment were for a single year, 2006. (Id. at 262–\n\n76). Furthermore, the landscaping invoices Sarah attached to her motion\n\nfor summary judgment included one invoice in 2009, two invoices in 2010,\n\nand one invoice in 2012. (1 Supp. CR at 277–86). This evidence, even if\n\nadmissible, is insufficient to establish adverse possession as a matter of law.\n\n      F.     Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n             Hankins’ counterclaims for conversion, partition, and\n             trespass to try title are barred as a matter of law.\n\n      Sarah filed a second motion for summary judgment, in which she\n\nchallenged Hankins’ counterclaims. (2 Supp. CR at 1240–55). In this\n\nsecond motion for summary judgment, Sarah claimed, inter alia,9 that\n\nHankins’ claim for conversion failed as a matter of law. (Id.). Specifically,\n\nSarah claimed that Hankins’ conversion claim failed because he allegedly\n\n\n9 Hankins is not challenging the trial court’s grant of summary judgment on his claims\nfor declaratory relief, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment.\n                                          62\n\fnever obtained any interest in the property and thus, he was never a co–\n\ntenant. (Id. at 1244). Sarah’s challenge to Hankins’ counterclaim for\n\nconversion was a rehash of her first summary judgment argument: Hankins\n\npurportedly has no claim because he never acquired any interest in the\n\nProperty. Sarah is wrong. Hankins reurges, but will not rehash the\n\narguments he asserts in Sections B, C, and D of this brief, which detail how\n\nhe acquired an interest in the Property and how the trial court erred in\n\ndetermining that he had no interest in the Property. The trial court’s\n\nsummary judgment disposing of Hankins’ conversion claim must be\n\nreversed.\n\n     It also must be noted that Sarah’s second motion for summary\n\njudgment didn’t specifically challenge Hankins’ claims for trespass to try\n\ntitle and partition. To the extent these claims were disposed of because the\n\ntrial court’s earlier summary judgment ruling, this disposition must be\n\nreversed. For the reasons set forth in Section E above, Sarah failed to\n\nestablish her adverse possession claim as a matter of law. Hankins reurges,\n\nbut will not rehash the arguments he asserts in Section E of this brief,\n\nwhich detail how Sarah failed to carry her burden of proof to establish her\n\nright to summary judgment as a matter of law. If the trial court’s summary\n\njudgment on Sarah’s adverse possession claim is reversed, then her second\n\n\n                                    63\n\fmotion for summary judgment. Likewise, if the trial court’s finding that\n\nHankins owns no interest in the Property is reversed, Hankins requests that\n\nhis claims for trespass to try title and partition be reinstated and remanded.\n\n                         Conclusion and Prayer\n\n      The trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motions for summary\n\njudgment. At a minimum, Hankins’ judgment and execution liens are still\n\neffective and thus, he has an interest in the Property. And even if the Court\n\nwere inclined to affirm the voiding of the execution sale, equity warrants\n\nreviving Hankins’ judgment and his liens. Hankins therefore requests that\n\nthe Court reverse the trial court’s grant of summary judgments in favor of\n\nSarah Harris, reverse the final judgment, and remand this matter back to\n\nthe trial court.\n\n                                    Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                    LEYH, PAYNE & MALLIA, PLLC\n\n\n                                    By: /s/ Sean M.

The Property .............................................................................. 2\n\n        B.       Hankins sues Norma for slander and obtains a\n                 judgment against her in 1978. .................................................... 3\n\n        C.       Norma moves out of the Property with the intention of\n                 not returning, and Roy files for divorce...................................... 4\n\n        D.       After Norma abandons her undivided one–half interest\n                 in the Property, Hankins obtains a writ of execution,\n                 which eventually leads to Norma’s interest in the\n                 Property being levied. ................................................................. 6\n\n        E.       Norma and Roy devise a scheme to put Norma’s\n                 undivided one–half interest out of the reach of her\n                 judgment creditor, Hankins. ...................................................... 7\n\n        F.       Throughout the years, the parties exchange multiple\n                 letters and engage in discussions regarding the\n                 Property and Hankins’ desire to liquidate the same. ................. 9\n\n        G.       Harris files this lawsuit to declare Hankins’ undivided\n                 one–half interest in the Property void.......................................12\n\n        H.       Sarah moves for summary judgment on her affirmative\n                 claims and Hankins’ counterclaims...........................................12\n\n\n\n                                                      viii\n\fSummary of the Argument ...........................................................................14\n\nArgument & Authorities ...............................................................................16\n\n       A.      This Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment\n               de novo. .....................................................................................16\n\n       B.      Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n               Hankins owns no interest in the Property. At a\n               minimum, Hankins’ judgment and execution liens\n               attached to the Property and are still valid. ............................... 17\n\n               1.      Even if the Divorce Decree and Marriage\n                       Settlement Agreement constitute a valid\n                       conveyance (they do not), any interest Roy\n                       acquired during the divorce proceeding was\n                       subject to Hankins’ judgment lien. ................................. 18\n\n               2.      The Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement\n                       Agreement didn’t convey Norma’s interest in the\n                       Property to Roy because the parties indicated a\n                       future or prospective intent to convey, rather\n                       than a present intent, which was confirmed by\n                       their later actions. ...............................................................\n\n               3.      Sarah’s claim that the Marriage Settlement\n                       Agreement is an executory contract that vested\n                       Roy with equitable title on the date the Divorce\n                       Decree is flat wrong. ........................................................ 24\n\n       C.      Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that the\n               automatic bankruptcy stay applied to the execution\n               sale. Even if it did, Court should return the parties to\n               the status quo. .......................................................................... 26\n\n               1.      Even if Norma conveyed her interest in the\n                       Property to Roy, that conveyance was void and\n                       thus, not part of the bankruptcy estate. .......................... 27\n\n\n\n\n                                                     ix\n\f     2.      Norma’s interest didn’t pass to Roy, and thus, her\n             interest in the Property was not a part of his\n             bankruptcy estate or subject to the automatic\n             stay. ................................................................................. 29\n\n     3.      Even if Norma’s interest in the Property were\n             subject to the automatic stay, the Court should\n             restore the parties to the status quo, revive\n             Hankins’ judgment, and revive his judgment and\n             execution liens................................................................. 33\n\n\nD.   Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n     Hankins executed on homestead property. Rather, the\n     evidence shows that Hankins executed on Norma’s\n     undivided, one–half interest in the Property, which she\n     had abandoned. ........................................................................ 36\n\n     1.      Limits on homestead protections do exist: The\n             homestead protection doesn’t protect property\n             interests that are not the debtor’s actual\n             homestead. ...................................................................... 36\n\n     2.      Norma possessed a vested homestead interest in\n             the Property that was separate and independent\n             from Roy’s interest. But she abandoned that\n             interest when she moved out of the home with no\n             intention of returning, with her abandonment\n             becoming effective on the date of her divorce. ............... 37\n\n     3.      Roy’s homestead interest in the Property could\n             not prevent the forced sale of Norma’s interest in\n             the Property......................................................................41\n\n     4.      Any claim by Sarah that Roy owned 100% of the\n             Property on the execution date and thus, this\n             interest protected the Property from the\n             execution sale would lack merit. ..................................... 46\n\n\n\n\n                                           x\n\f        E.      Sarah failed to establish any of adverse possession\n                claims as a matter of law. ......................................................... 47\n\n                 1.      Overview of adverse possession in Texas. ....................... 47\n\n                2.       A claimant seeking to adversely possess a co–\n                         tenant’s interest in land has a more onerous\n                         burden—the claimant must also prove clear,\n                         unequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation of\n                         the common title. ............................................................ 49\n\n                3.       At best, the earliest Sarah could have repudiated\n                         Hankins’ interest in the Property would have\n                         been March 8, 2005. ....................................................... 50\n\n                4.       Sarah’s alternative bases for establishing\n                         repudiation are also insufficient to establish\n                         repudiation as a matter of law......................................... 52\n\n                5.       Sarah cannot establish adverse possession under\n                         either the 10–year or 25–year limitation period\n                         because the applicable time periods have not yet\n                         elapsed............................................................................. 54\n\n                6.       Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                         possession under the 3–year limitation period as\n                         a matter of law. ................................................................ 55\n\n                7.       Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                         possession under the 5–year and 10–year\n                         limitation periods as a matter of law............................... 56\n\n        F.      Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n                Hankins’ counterclaims for conversion, partition, and\n                trespass to try title are barred as a matter of law. .................... 62\n\nConclusion and Prayer ................................................................................ 64\n\nCertificate of Service.................................................................................... 65\n\nCertificate of Compliance ............................................................................ 66\n\n                                                      xi\n\f                                              Appendix\n\nDecember 5, 2014 Summary Judgment Order........................................Tab 1\n\nMarch 26, 2015 Summary Judgment Order ..........................................

Defendant/Appellant,\nJohn Hankins claims an undivided one–half interest in real property\nlocated in Harris County, Texas that he asserts he acquired at a 1980\nexecution sale. Plaintiff/Appellee, Sarah Harris is the daughter of the\njudgment debtor. She claims that the execution sale is void on multiple\ngrounds. Harris also claims title to the entire fee simple through adverse\npossession.\n\nHarris’s live pleading is located in the record at 1 Supp. CR at 5–39.\nHankins’ live counterclaim for affirmative relief is located in the record at 1\nSupp. CR at 43–93.\n\nTrial Court:\n\nHonorable Joseph J. “Tad” Halbach, Jr.\n333rd Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas\n\nProceedings Below:\n\nHarris moved for summary judgment on her affirmative claims for relief\nand on Hankins’ counterclaims. The trial court granted both motions. (2\nSupp. CR at 1237–39, Appx. 1) (first MJS order); (CR at 215–16, Appx. 2)\n(second MSJ order). The trial court later rendered a final judgment. (CR at\n224–26, Appx. 3). In the final judgment, the trial court granted the\nfollowing declaratory relief: (1) Harris owns the entire fee simple interest in\nthe Property, (2) Hankins has no interest in the Property, (3) the purported\nConstable’s Sale of the Property is void, and (4) the Deed under Execution\nof September 29, 1980 is void.\n\n\n\n\n                                      xx\n\f                            Issues Presented\n\nIssue Presented Number One:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and\ndeclaring that John Hankins owns no interest in the Property.\n\nIssue Presented Number Two:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and\ndeclaring that Sarah owns the entire fee simple interest in the Property.\n\nIssue Presented Number Three:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and\nfinding that she adversely possessed Hankins’ interest in the Property.\n\nIssue Presented Number Four:\n\nThe trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment on\nHankins’ counterclaims for conversion, partition, and trespass to try title.\n\nIssue Presented Number Five:\n\nIf the underlying execution sale is void, which Hankins disputes, the trial\ncourt erred by declining to put the parties back to the status quo.\n\n\n\n\n                                     xxi\n\f                Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      Hankins requests oral argument. This appeal involves important\nquestions regarding creditors’ rights, the breadth of the Texas homestead\nprotection, the applicability of the automatic bankruptcy stay, and the use\nof adverse possession to strip a judgment creditor of his interest in the only\nproperty remaining that could be used to satisfy a 1978 judgment. Thus,\nHankins believes that oral argument would assist the Court in resolving this\ncase.\n\n\n\n\n                                     xxii\n\fTO THE HONORABLE FIRST COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n                               Introduction\n\n      It is axiomatic that justice delayed is justice denied. John Hankins\n\nobtained a $600,000 judgment against Norma Harris after she attempted\n\nto ruin his career with slanderous accusations nearly 40 years ago. Today,\n\nHankins is still looking to collect on his judgment.\n\n      Hankins did execute on Norma’s non–exempt undivided one–half\n\ninterest in real property located in 1980. But Norma and her ex–husband,\n\nRoy, played the legal system in a desperate attempt to put Norma’s most\n\nsignificant asset out of the reach of her judgment creditor, Hankins. Norma\n\nand Roy tried and failed to secure a valid restraining order preventing\n\nHankins from executing on the Norma’s interest in the Property. Norma\n\nthen executed a fraudulent conveyance—Norma transferred her undivided\n\none–half interest in the Property to Roy the day before he filed for\n\nbankruptcy protection in an effort to cloak a non–exempt asset with the\n\nprotection of the bankruptcy court. Now, Sarah—Norma and Roy’s\n\ndaughter—is attempting to continue the family tradition and use the courts\n\nto deprive Hankins of the justice he has waited nearly 40 years to receive. If\n\nthis long–running dispute is to be finally decided once and for all, justice\n\ndemands that it should be decided by a trial on the merits, and not by the\n\n\n                                      1\n\fsummary disposition entered by the trial court. Summary judgment was\n\nimproper because Sarah failed to carry her burden to establish her right to\n\nthe same as a matter of law. Thus, a reversal is necessary and warranted.\n\n\n                                  Statement of Facts\n\n         A.     The Property\n\n         While there may be claims asserted by both parties for ancillary relief,\n\nthe heart of this matter is whether John Hankins owns an undivided one–\n\nhalf interest in certain real property with Sarah Harris, or whether Sarah1\n\nowns the property free and clear of Hankins’ claim. The Property is\n\ncurrently a vacant lot located at 2922 Bellaire Boulevard in Houston, Texas,\n\nlegally described as:\n\n                Lot Three (3) in Block Two (2) of West University\n                Place, an addition to the city of West University\n                Place in Harris County, Texas, according to the map\n                thereof recorded in Volume 444, Page 560 of the\n                Deed Records of Harris County, Texas.\n\n(See 1 Supp. CR at 7) (the “Property”).\n\n\n\n\n1   Hankins will address Sarah, Norma, and Roy Harris by the first names for clarity.\n                                              2\n\f      B.    Hankins sues Norma for slander and obtains a\n            judgment against her in 1978.\n\n      The genesis of this lawsuit is Hankins’ efforts to stop the\n\ninappropriate conduct of Dr. Roy Harris more than 45 years ago. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 484). In 1969, Hankins was an administrator at a hospital in\n\nHouston. (Id., ¶ 12). Roy was an anesthesiologist who held privileges at the\n\nsame hospital. (Id.). Hankins received numerous complaints from hospital\n\nstaff and patients involving Roy improperly touching patients under\n\nanesthesia. (Id.). For example, Roy was caught fondling a female patient’s\n\nbreasts during surgery and was also found lying in bed with female patients\n\nunder anesthesia. (Id.). Hankins asked Roy to voluntary relinquish his\n\nprivileges, which Roy agreed to do. (Id.).\n\n      Roy was married to Norma Harris, who was also a doctor. (1 Supp. CR\n\nat 484, ¶ 13). After word spread throughout the medical community that\n\nRoy had engaged in inappropriate behavior, Norma became enraged and\n\nwaged a personal vendetta against Hankins. (Id.). Specifically, in 1971,\n\nHankins accepted employment with a different hospital in Houston. (Id.).\n\nWhat Hankins didn’t know was that Norma was an investor and doctor at\n\nthis hospital. (Id.). Seizing upon an opportunity for revenge, Norma, along\n\nwith Roy and other co–conspirators, devised a scheme to slander Hankins.\n\n(Id.). Norma and her co–conspirators accused Hankins of stealing $10,000\n\n                                      3\n\ffrom the hospital and had him arrested for theft. (Id.). There was no\n\nevidence to support the charges, and they were later dropped and\n\nexpunged. (Id.).\n\n      Hankins later filed a lawsuit for slander against Norma, among\n\nothers. (1 Supp. CR at 484–85, ¶ 15). The case was tried to a jury, which\n\nunanimously found that Norma had falsely and maliciously accused\n\nHankins of stealing from the hospital. (Id. at 485, ¶ 15). In February 1978, a\n\njudgment for $600,000 was rendered against Norma and in favor of\n\nHankins.2 (Id.; see also, (1 Supp. CR at 291–93 (Appx. 4)). Roy was not a\n\nparty to the judgment. (Id.). It is undisputed that Hankins abstracted his\n\njudgment against Norma in 1978. (1 Supp. CR at 485, ¶ 16; 2 Supp. CR at\n\n1213). Norma’s efforts to overturn the judgment on appeal were\n\nunsuccessful. (1 Supp. CR at 485, ¶¶ 17–18).\n\n      C.     Norma moves out of the Property with the intention of\n             not returning, and Roy files for divorce.\n\n      While Norma’s appeals of the judgment against her were pending, her\n\nmarriage to Roy was ending. Roy and Norma stopped living together as\n\nhusband and wife on or about March 7, 1980, with Roy filing for divorce 10\n\ndays later. (2 Supp. CR at 1148, 1213).\n\n2 Adjusted for inflation, a $600,000 judgment in February 1978 would today be\nequivalent to $2.193 million. See Bureau of Labor Statistics, CPI Inflation Calculator,\navailable at http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm, last visited October 6,\n2015.\n                                          4\n\f      At the time the divorce was filed, Norma had vacated the Property\n\nand moved to Brownsville. (Id. at 1127–29). And Norma, at least between\n\nthe time she separated from Roy in March 1980 and her September 2, 1980\n\npost–judgment deposition, did not intend to return to the Property. (2\n\nSupp. CR at 1113–15). Specifically, Norma testified in her deposition with\n\nregard to her living situation as follows:\n\n            Q.    Let me ask it this way: Is it not now your\n                  intention and hasn’t it been your intention\n                  since the time you separated from Dr. Roy to\n                  move back into the 2922 Bellaire Boulevard\n                  house as soon as possible?\n\n            A.    You mean after I was divorced?\n\n            Q.    Yes.\n\n            A.    No.\n\n            Q.    And even before?\n\n            A.    No.\n\n            ***\n            Q.    Now, in spite of all that, do you still maintain\n                  and contend that it’s not your intention to\n                  move back into that house as your home?\n\n            A.    No, I have no intention of that.\n\n\n            Q.    You have no intention of moving back?\n\n            A.    I can’t.\n\n\n                                       5\n\f(2 Supp. CR at 1113–15).\n\n         Roy and Norma were divorced on June 20, 1980. (1 Supp. CR at 378–\n\n82 (Appx. 5)). As part of the divorce, Roy and Norma entered into a\n\nMarriage Settlement Agreement, which allegedly addressed the disposition\n\nof the Property. (1 Supp. CR at 383–402 (Appx. 6)). The Marriage\n\nSettlement Agreement stated that Roy “shall have and own [the Property]\n\nas his separate property.” (Id. at 385). The Marriage Settlement Agreement\n\nalso provided the following that “[t]itle to the house shall be transferred to\n\nand vested solely in Husband as his separate property[,]” and in return,\n\n“Husband agrees to pay Wife the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars,” which\n\nwould be evidenced by a promissory note. (Id. at 387–88). There is no\n\nevidence that Roy ever paid Norma for the Property. (See 2 Supp. CR at\n\n1131).\n\n         D.   After Norma abandons her undivided one–half\n              interest in the Property, Hankins obtains a writ of\n              execution, which eventually leads to Norma’s interest\n              in the Property being levied.\n\n         Shortly after Norma divorced Roy and abandoned her undivided\n\none–half interest in the Property, Hankins requested a writ of execution\n\nand requested that the constable levy upon this interest, which the\n\nconstable did on August 6, 1980. (2 Supp. CR at 1145 (Appx. 7); id. at 426\n\n(Appx. 8)). Later, on September 2, 1980, the constable sold all of Norma’s\n\n                                      6\n\f“estate, right, title, and interest” in the property. (Id.). Hankins was the\n\nwinning bidder at the execution sale, which was completed at 10:30 a.m. (2\n\nSupp. CR at 1154; id. at 489, ¶ 32). Hankins later received an execution\n\ndeed, which conveyed to him “all of the estate, right, title, and interest” that\n\nNorma had in the Property. (Id.).\n\n        E.   Norma and Roy devise a scheme to put Norma’s\n             undivided one–half interest out of the reach of her\n             judgment creditor, Hankins.\n\n        After receiving notice of the constable’s sale, and without Hankins’\n\nknowledge, Norma and Roy sprang into action to prevent the execution\n\nsale.\n\n        Norma and Roy first applied for an ex parte restraining order to\n\nprevent Hankins and the constable from executing on Norma’s undivided\n\none–half interest in the Property. (1 Supp. CR at 185, ¶ 14). The application\n\nwas filed on Roy and Norma’s behalf by Matthew Hoffman’s firm, which\n\nrepresented Norma in the divorce proceeding earlier that year. (Id. at 375–\n\n77, 474 (Appx. 9)). The court granted the temporary restraining order on\n\nAugust 29, 1980. (Id. at 474–76). But the order did not, inter alia, state the\n\nhour of issuance, define the injury, state why any harm or injury would be\n\nirreparable, or state why the order was granted without notice. (Compare\n\nid. with Tex. R. Civ. P. 680.) The court did set a bond in the amount of\n\n\n                                       7\n\f$50,000. (Id. at 476). But Norma and Roy never paid the bond, and thus,\n\nthe clerk never issued a writ. (2 Supp. CR at 876).\n\n      After failing in their attempt to get a valid and enforceable injunction,\n\nRoy and Norma then attempted to put Norma’s undivided interest in the\n\nProperty out of the reach of Hankins’ levy by having Norma convey her\n\ninterest to Roy. (1 Supp. CR at 478–80 (Appx. 10)). Specifically, Norma\n\nexecuted a Special Warranty Deed on September 1, 1980, in which she\n\nconveyed to Roy “the entirety of [her] right, title, and interest in and to” the\n\nProperty, which would have been her undivided one–half interest. (Id. at\n\n478). The Deed was executed on September 1, 1980 and filed the next day\n\nat 9 a.m. (Id. at 476–78). Roy also gave Norma a Deed of Trust to secure a\n\npromissory note in the amount of $50,000, which represented the\n\npurchase price. (1 Supp. CR at 146–50 (Appx. 11); see id. at 387–88)\n\n(divorce decree stated that Roy was to pay Norma $50,000 for her\n\nundivided interest in the property, to be evidenced by a promissory note).\n\n      Roy filed for bankruptcy on September 2, 1980 at 8:06 a.m. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 186, ¶ 16). Roy listed Norma as a creditor on his bankruptcy schedule,\n\nand he listed the $50,000 he allegedly owed Norma for the Property, as\n\nevidenced by a vendor’s lien and deed of trust that had been executed the\n\nday before. (1 Supp. CR at 425 (Appx. 12); id. at 146–50). Roy received a\n\n\n                                       8\n\ffinal discharge from the bankruptcy court on May 19, 1981. (1 Supp. CR at\n\n436 (Appx. 14)). Later that spring, Norma moved back into the Property\n\nand reconciled with Roy. (See 2 Supp. CR at 957–58).\n\n     F.    Throughout the years, the parties exchange multiple\n           letters and engage in discussions regarding the\n           Property and Hankins’ desire to liquidate the same.\n\n     Following the execution sale and bankruptcy proceeding, things\n\nbetween Hankins and the Harris family apparently cooled off. The next\n\nspecific activity that anyone took with regard to the Property, at least what\n\nis in the record, was Roy conveying whatever interest he owned in the\n\nProperty to Sarah in March 1984. (1 Supp. CR at 187, ¶ 20); id. at 287–88\n\n(Appx. 15)). But Roy and Norma remained in possession of the Property, as\n\nSarah stated in her interrogatory answers that she “had an informal\n\narrangement to rent the Property to [her] mom and dad, off and on, from\n\n1984 to 2005.” (2 Supp. CR at 1143, Interrogatory No. 10).\n\n     After Roy conveyed his interest in the Property to Sarah, he\n\napparently received a letter from an attorney representing Hankins. Roy\n\nagain retained Hoffman to send a response. (See 1 Supp. CR at 407–14\n\n(Appx. 16)). Hoffman allegedly wrote a letter to Hankins’ attorney in July\n\n1984. (Id.). In his letter, Hoffman referred to Roy as “our client.” (Id.at\n\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\f407). The letter was also sent to Roy and Norma. (Id. at 416). Sarah was not\n\ncopied on the letter, nor was she mentioned in the letter. (Id.).\n\n      As to the substance of Hoffman’s letter, he stated that it was his\n\nclients’ position that Hankins’ execution deed was void because of the\n\ntemporary restraining order and the automatic bankruptcy stay. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 407–14). Specifically, Hoffman represented that “Mr. Hankins has no\n\nlegitimate interest” in the Property. (Id. at 408). But neither Norma nor\n\nRoy owned any interest in the Property when this letter was allegedly sent\n\nin July 1984. (1 Supp. CR at 187, ¶ 20; see also, id. at 150–51). Hankins\n\nasserts that he never received Hoffman’s July 1984 letter. (2 Supp. CR at\n\n1159, ¶ 4). Nor does Hankins know if his attorneys received Hoffman’s July\n\n1984 letter. (Id. at 941).\n\n      In 1990, Hankins found another attorney to help him in his effort to\n\nliquidate his interest in the Property. On September 7, 1990, Hoffman\n\nwrote Hankins’ counsel again. (1 Supp. CR at 416–38 (Appx. 17). Hoffman\n\nwrote this letter in response to a conference call he had with Hankins’ new\n\nattorney, during which Hoffman ascertained that “Hankins has come to you\n\n[Hankins’ new counsel] with the thought that he may now have some action\n\nagainst our client, Dr. Norma Harris … .” (Id. at 416). Hoffman then\n\nrepresented that certain documents attached to the letter would show that\n\n\n                                      10\n\fHankins didn’t have any “viable further cause of action.” (Id.). Hoffman\n\nrepresented that Roy’s bankruptcy discharge prevented Hankins from\n\n“taking any action to recover a debt, if any, incurred by the debtor prior to\n\nthe initiation of the bankruptcy case.” (Id. at 417). Specifically, Hoffman\n\nclaimed that the discharge order “forbids any judicial action on any claims\n\nMr. Hankins may have had against Dr. Roy Harris, the Chapter 7 Debtor.”\n\n(Id.). Hoffman’s letter concludes with him stating “[w]e have discussed this\n\nmatter with Dr. Norma Harris, who is outraged by your client’s attempt …\n\nto reopen [this matter.]” (Id. at 418). Neither Norma nor Roy owned the\n\nproperty when the 1990 letter was allegedly sent to Hankins. (2 Supp. CR at\n\n983; see also, 1 Supp. CR at 150–51).\n\n     On October 6, 1992, Sarah purportedly conveyed the interest in the\n\nProperty she received from her father in March 1984 back to him. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 160–62). In 1996, Roy again conveyed whatever interest he had in the\n\nproperty back to Sarah. (Id. at 163–64).\n\n     In 2005, as at least a partial owner of the Property, Sarah retained\n\nThomas McCaffrey to respond to another letter issued by Hankins’\n\nattorney. (1 Supp. CR at 439; 441–72). On March 8, 2005, McCaffrey\n\nmerely resent Hoffman’s letters, the attachments to the 1990 letter, and a\n\nletter from Hankins’ attorney in 1984. (Id. at 441–72 (Appx. 18)).\n\n\n                                        11\n\fMcCaffrey didn’t claim that Sarah was repudiating Hankins’ interest in the\n\nproperty, nor does he state why he sent the letter. (Id. at 439–72).\n\n      G.    Harris files this lawsuit to declare Hankins’ undivided\n            one–half interest in the Property void.\n\n      Sarah sued Hankins and sought a declaratory judgment that: (1) she\n\nowns a fee simple interest in the Property, (2) Hankins owns no interest in\n\nthe Property, and (3) Hankins’ execution sale is void. (1 Supp. CR at 13,\n\n¶27). Sarah also asserted a claim to quiet title and a claim for adverse\n\npossession. (Id. at 13–14, ¶¶ 28–36).\n\n      Hankins filed a counterclaim, asserting, inter alia, a trespass to try\n\ntitle claim and a request that the property be partitioned. (1 Supp. CR at\n\n43–93).\n\n      H.    Sarah moves for summary judgment on                        her\n            affirmative claims and Hankins’ counterclaims.\n\n      Sarah filed two motions for summary judgment. (1 Supp. CR at 180–\n\n508; 2 Supp. CR at 1240–55). Sarah’ first motion for summary judgment\n\naddressed her affirmative claims, while her second motion addressed\n\nHankins’ counterclaims. (Id.).\n\n      In her first motion for summary judgment, Sarah asserted the\n\nfollowing four grounds: (1) Hankins’ execution deed is void because the\n\nconstable executed on homestead property, (2) Hankins’ execution deed is\n\n\n                                        12\n\falso void because the execution sale violated the automatic stay created by\n\nRoy’s bankruptcy filing, (3) Hankins owns no interest in the Property\n\nbecause Norma didn’t own an interest at the time of the time of the levy and\n\nexecution sale, and (4) even if Hankins had an interest in the Property,\n\nSarah adversely possessed that interest under the 3, 5, 10, and 25–year\n\nlimitations periods. (Id. at 190–99).\n\n      The trial court granted Sarah’s motion for summary judgment on her\n\nclaims for declaratory judgment, action to quiet title, and adverse\n\npossession. (2 Supp. CR at 1237–39 (Appx. 1)). The trial court didn’t specify\n\nwhy it granted Sarah’s motion for summary judgment nor did it specify the\n\ngrounds on which the motion was granted. (Id.).\n\n      In her second motion for summary judgment, Sarah claimed, inter\n\nalia,3 that Hankins’ claim for conversion failed as a matter of law. (2 Supp.\n\nCR at 1240–55). Specifically, Sarah claimed that Hankins’ conversion claim\n\nfailed because he allegedly never obtained any interest in the Property and\n\nthus, he was never a co–tenant. (Id. at 1244). Sarah didn’t move for\n\nsummary judgment on Hankins’ claims for trespass to try title or partition\n\nin this second motion for summary judgment. (Id. at 1240–55).\n\n\n\n3 Hankins is not appealing the trial court’s grant of Sarah’s motion for summary\njudgment on his claims for unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel, or his request\nfor declaratory relief.\n                                        13\n\f      The trial court signed a second summary judgment order on March\n\n26, 2015, in which the court granted both of Sarah’s motions for summary\n\njudgment and granted the same relief. (CR at 215–16 (Appx. 2)). Again, the\n\ntrial court didn’t specify its reasons for granting Sarah’s motions for\n\nsummary judgment. (Id.). The trial overruled Hankins’ objections and\n\nspecial exceptions to both of Sarah’s motions for summary judgment. (CR\n\nat 227 (Appx. 19)).\n\n      A final judgment was rendered on April 27, 2015. (CR at 226–27\n\n(Appx. 13)). The final judgment declared the following: (1) Sarah owns the\n\nentire fee simple interest in the Property, (2) Hankins owns no interest in\n\nthe Property, (3) the execution sale is void, and (4) Hankins’ execution deed\n\nis void. (Id.).\n\n                      Summary of the Argument\n\n      The trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary\n\njudgment and declaring that John Hankins owns no interest in the\n\nProperty, and the trial court erred in declaring that Sarah owns the entire\n\nfee simple interest in the Property. Hankins asserts that he properly\n\nexecuted on Norma’s undivided one–half interest in the Property, which\n\nshe had abandoned as her homestead. Norma’s interest in the Property\n\nwasn’t subject to the automatic stay triggered by Roy’s bankruptcy filing, as\n\n\n                                     14\n\fany purported conveyance to Roy would be void. Regardless, at a\n\nminimum, Hankins still has perfected judgment and execution liens on the\n\nProperty that could not been affected by the bankruptcy proceeding. Thus,\n\nSarah failed to establish as a matter of law that Hankins owns no interest in\n\nthe Property, and she failed to establish as a matter of law that she owns the\n\nfee simple interest in the Property free and clear of his interest or liens.\n\n      The trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motion for summary\n\njudgment and finding that she adversely possessed Hankins’ interest in the\n\nProperty. Sarah failed to establish any of her adverse possession claims as a\n\nmatter of law. Sarah’s 3–year claim fails because she failed to establish a\n\nchain of title from the sovereign. Sarah’s 10–year and 25–year claims have\n\nnot yet ripen because the earliest possible date she could have repudiated\n\nHankins’ co–tenancy interest would have been March 8, 2005. And with\n\nregard to her 5–year and 10–year claims, Sarah failed to establish as a\n\nmatter of law the required elements of actual, visible, continuous, and\n\nuninterrupted use, and failed to establish as a matter of law the requisite\n\ncultivation, use, and enjoyment of the Property that is necessary to\n\nadversely possess against a co–tenant.\n\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\f      For many of the same reasons, the trial court erred in granting\n\nSarah’s motion for summary judgment on Hankins’ counterclaims for\n\nconversion, partition, and trespass to try title.\n\n      And finally, if the Court is to determine that the execution sale is void,\n\nthe Court should reinstate the status quo and allow Hankins to either revive\n\nhis judgment and execution liens or recognize their continued validity.\n\n\n                          Argument & Authorities\n\n      A.     This Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment\n             de novo.\n\n      Appellate courts review a trial court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Merriman v.

Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n            Hankins owns no interest in the Property. At a\n            minimum, Hankins’ judgment and execution liens\n            attached to the Property and are still valid.\n\n      Sarah claims that she is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw because Norma owned no interest in the Property as of June 17, 1980.\n\n(1 Supp. CR at 194–95). Thus, Sarah claims that when Hankins attempted\n\nto execute on Norma’s interest on September 2, 1980, there was no interest\n\nfor him to execute upon. (1 Supp. CR at 194–95). Sarah bases this claim on\n\nthe Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement Agreement entered into by\n\nRoy and Norma. Sarah claims that these documents conveyed whatever\n\ninterest Norma had in the Property to Roy as of June 17, 1980. (1 Supp. CR\n\nat 194). Sarah is wrong for several reasons.\n\n                                      17\n\f            1.    Even if the Divorce Decree and Marriage\n                  Settlement    Agreement    constitute a valid\n                  conveyance (they do not), any interest Roy\n                  acquired during the divorce proceeding was\n                  subject to Hankins’ judgment lien.\n\n      Any interest Roy obtained from Norma—either at the time the\n\nDivorce Decree was rendered in June 1980 or when Norma gave him the\n\nSpecial Warranty Deed in September 1980—was subject to Hankins’\n\njudgment lien, which Hankins perfected in 1978.\n\n      Filing and recording an abstract of judgment creates a judgment lien\n\nas to a judgment debtor’s real property.

The purpose of an abstract of\n\njudgment is to: (1) create a judgment lien in the first place, and (2) provide\n\nnotice to subsequent purchasers of that lien’s existence. Gordon, 352\n\nS.W.3d at 38. Thus, when an abstract of judgment is properly recorded and\n\nindexed, it creates a judgment lien that is superior to the rights of\n\nsubsequent purchasers and lien holders. Id. at 39. Thus, it is axiomatic that\n\nif a judgment lien properly attaches to real property, a subsequent\n\npurchaser of that property purchases it subject to the judgment lien. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                     18\n\f      Also, a valid levy creates an execution lien on the debtor’s property in\n\nfavor of the judgment creditor. Gordon, 352 S.W.3d at 39; Won, 324\n\nS.W.3d at 835. A judgment lien and an execution lien work together so that\n\n“[i]f a judgment creditor obtains a judgment lien and then executes on the\n\njudgment, the date of the execution lien relates back to the date of the\n\njudgment lien, thereby giving the judgment creditor priority over other\n\ncreditors with claims arising after the date of the judgment lien.” Gordon,\n\n352 S.W.3d at 39 (quoting Won, 324 S.W.3d at 835, n. 3).\n\n      Here, it is undisputed that Hankins filed and recorded his abstract of\n\njudgment in 1978. (1 Supp. CR at 485, ¶ 16; 2 Supp. CR at 1213). Shortly\n\nafter Norma divorced Roy and abandoned her undivided one–half interest\n\nin the Property,4 Hankins requested a writ of execution and requested that\n\nthe constable levy on Norma’s interest in the Property, which the constable\n\ndid on August 6, 1980. (1 Supp. CR at 403; id. at 426). Thus, Hankins’\n\njudgment lien was perfected in 1978 by the filing and recording of his\n\nabstract of judgment, and his execution lien was perfected on August 6,\n\n1980 when the levied was issued. Hankins’ liens on Norma’s property were\n\nsuperior to the rights of any subsequent purchasers, including Roy.\n\n4 Norma moved out of the home before the divorce was filed, and after the divorce was\nfinal, she had no intention of returning to the Property. Thus, Norma abandoned her\nhomestead interest in the Property. As a result of her abandonment, Hankins’ judgment\nlien attached to her undivided one–half interest in the Property. This will be discussed\nin more detail in § D–2.\n                                          19\n\fGordon, 352 S.W.3d at 39. Thus, any interest Roy may have acquired from\n\nNorma in 1980 was subject to Hankins’ judgment lien. Id. So, even if\n\nNorma conveyed her interest to Roy in 1980, Hankins’ lien was still valid\n\nand superior—Norma could not escape the effect of Hankins’ judgment lien\n\nby merely conveying her interest in the Property. Id.\n\n           2.    The Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement\n                 Agreement didn’t convey Norma’s interest in the\n                 Property to Roy because the parties indicated a\n                 future or prospective intent to convey, rather\n                 than a present intent, which was confirmed by\n                 their later actions.\n\n     Sarah claims that Roy acquired all of Norma’s interest in the Property\n\nthrough the Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement Agreement. Sarah is\n\nwrong because the Marriage Settlement Agreement, incorporated into the\n\nDivorce Decree, reflected Norma’s and Roy’s intent to effect a future\n\ntransfer of Norma’s interest in the Property, as opposed to an immediate\n\ntransfer. This intent is evidenced by the language of the Marriage\n\nSettlement Agreement and Norma and Roy’s actions in the months that\n\nfollowed, which culminated with Norma’s execution of a Special Warranty\n\nDeed. Therefore, Roy didn’t acquire Norma’s interest in the Property\n\nthrough the divorce proceeding.\n\n     Conveyance by deed requires delivery of the deed. TEX.

Generally, title\n\nto transferred property vests upon execution and delivery of the deed. Id. at\n\n261.

Id. at 261–62.\n\n     As an initial matter, there is no evidence that either the Divorce\n\nDecree or Marriage Settlement Agreement was recorded with the Harris\n\nCounty real property records, much less before Norma’s interest was levied\n\non August 6, 1980. (1 Supp. CR at 378–82; id. at 383–402). In fact, neither\n\nthe Divorce Decree nor the Marriage Settlement Agreement could have\n\nbeen filed as a deed because neither document was attested to under the\n\n\n                                     21\n\fhand and seal of the clerk for the court that rendered the judgment.

Specifically, Norma’s and\n\nRoy’s actions indicate that they did not intend for either the Divorce Decree\n\nor the Marriage Settlement Agreement to operate as a conveyance of\n\nNorma’s interest.\n\n      First, the Marriage Settlement Agreement specifically stated that\n\n“[t]itle to the house shall be transferred to and vested solely in [Roy] as his\n\nseparate property.” (1 Supp. CR at 387–88). Likewise, in return for Norma\n\nconveying her title to the house, Roy “agree[d] to pay [Norma] the sum of\n\n$50,000” that was to be evidenced by a promissory note in the same\n\namount. Id.

Thus, the Marriage Settlement Agreement failed to evidence a\n\npresent intent to become immediately operative as a conveyance. (See 2\n\nSupp. CR at 1132) (Roy gave his deposition a month after the divorce was\n\nfinal and testified that the deed of Norma’s interest to him was “in the\n\nprocess”).\n\n      Second, Norma and Roy later executed a deed of trust, promissory\n\nnote, and special warranty deed. (1 Supp. CR at 478–80; (1 Supp. CR at\n\n\n                                      23\n\f146–50). If Norma and Roy believed that the Divorce Decree and Marriage\n\nSettlement Agreement constituted a conveyance of Norma’s interest, there\n\nwould not have been any need for them to later execute a deed of trust or a\n\nspecial warranty deed.\n\n      Third, Norma and Roy’s attorney, Matthew Hoffman, later\n\nrepresented that Norma “transferred her undivided fifty percent (50%)\n\ninterest in the Homestead Property to Roy Harris by Special Warranty\n\nDeed, pursuant to the above–mentioned June 20, 1980 Divorce Decree.”\n\n(Id. at 410). So, some four years after the rendition of the Divorce Decree,\n\nNorma’s and Roy’s attorney admitted that the Special Warranty Deed was\n\nexecuted pursuant to the divorce decree. (Id.). So, Roy didn’t acquire\n\nNorma’s undivided one–half interest in the Property through the Divorce\n\nDecree and Marriage Settlement Agreement.\n\n            3.    Sarah’s claim that the Marriage Settlement\n                  Agreement is an executory contract that vested\n                  Roy with equitable title on the date the Divorce\n                  Decree is flat wrong.\n\n      Sarah also sheepishly claimed in a footnote that, under the divorce\n\ndecree, Roy obtained equitable title to Norma’s share of the Property\n\nbecause the decree purportedly operated as executory contract. (1 Supp. CR\n\nat 195, n. 8). Sarah is wrong again.\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\f      An executory contract for the sale of real estate contemplates that the\n\npurchaser will complete performance in the future, that is, finishing making\n\npayments before title to the property passes. See Morton v. Nguyen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509–10 (Tex. 2013) (emphasis added) (“A contract for deed,\n\nunlike a typical secured transaction involving a deed of trust, is a financing\n\narrangement that allows the seller to maintain title to the property until the\n\nbuyer has paid for the property in full.)”; see also, Smith v.

App.—Tyler 2015, pet. denied) (unlike a traditional\n\nmortgage, an executory contract allows the seller to retain title to the\n\nproperty until the purchaser had paid for the property in full).\n\n      This is not the case here. Under the Marriage Settlement Agreement,\n\nthe transfer of Norma’s title was not contingent on Roy paying the entire\n\npurchase price. (1 Supp. CR at 387–88). Instead, Norma and Roy agreed\n\nthat “title to the house shall be transferred” to Roy, and more important,\n\nthey agreed that “[i]n return for the disposition of this asset to [Roy], [Roy]\n\nagrees to pay [Norma] the sum of … $50,000 … .” (Id.; see 2 Supp. CR at\n\n1132) (Roy gave his deposition a month after the divorce was final and\n\ntestified that the deed of Norma’s interest to him was “in the process”).\n\nThus, the Marriage Settlement Agreement was not an executory contract\n\nbecause Norma and Roy didn’t contemplate a future transfer of title upon\n\n\n                                      25\n\fthe payment of the full purchase price. (Id.). Thus, unlike a typical\n\nexecutory contract, where title is transferred in the future upon the full\n\npayment of the purchase price, Roy could obtain Norma’s legal title under\n\nthe Marriage Settlement Agreement before paying the purchase price.\n\n     Also, Sarah’s claim that the Divorce Decree and Marriage Settlement\n\nAgreement constitute an executory contract is puzzling in light of the deed\n\nof trust executed by Roy. In an executory contract, a purchaser who goes\n\ninto possession has equitable title, with the seller holding legal title. See\n\nJohnson v.

Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that the\n           automatic bankruptcy stay applied to the execution\n           sale. Even if it did, Court should return the parties to\n           the status quo.\n\n     Sarah next claims that the execution sale, and any interest Hankins\n\nacquired at the sale, is void because of the automatic bankruptcy stay\n\ntriggered by Roy’s bankruptcy filing. (1 Supp. CR at 193 (citing 11 U.S.C. §\n\n                                     26\n\f362(a)). Specifically, Sarah claims that Roy’s bankruptcy petition triggered\n\nan automatic stay that prevented the execution sale from going forward—\n\neven though the execution sale only involved Norma’s “estate, right, title,\n\nand interest” in the Property. In other words, because Roy owned at least\n\nan undivided one–half interest in the Property, this ownership interest and\n\nthe bankruptcy stay prevented any execution sale from going forward\n\nagainst Norma’s “estate, right, title, and interest” in the Property, despite\n\nthe fact that Norma wasn’t a bankruptcy debtor or a debtor’s spouse. Sarah\n\nis wrong because the purported transfer from Norma to Roy is void and of\n\nno effect under then existing Texas law. But even if Sarah were correct,\n\nHankins’ judgment and execution liens are still valid, which presents the\n\nCourt with an opportunity to restore the status quo.\n\n            1.    Even if Norma conveyed her interest in the\n                  Property to Roy, that conveyance was void and\n                  thus, not part of the bankruptcy estate.\n\n      At the time of Norma’s attempted conveyance to Roy, the conveyance\n\nwas void under Texas law and passed no title. Sections 24.02 and 24.03 of\n\nthe Business and Commerce Code in effect in 1980 dictated that all\n\nfraudulent conveyances were void. TEX. BUS. COM.

As a result, the Supreme\n\nCourt stated:\n\n            It necessarily follows that the legal as well as the\n            equitable title remains in the debtor for the purpose\n            of satisfying debts. Thus, when the creditor obtains\n            a judgment against the debtor, and properly records\n            and indexes an abstract of judgment, the creditor\n            acquires a lien upon the land just as though no\n            transfer had been made.\n\nId.\n\n      Here, Sarah was required to show that Norma’s interest passed to Roy\n\nthrough a valid conveyance as a matter of law. She failed to do so and\n\ncannot do so. Norma’s conveyance to Roy, her ex–husband at the time, was\n\n\n                                      28\n\fin fraud of her creditor, Hankins. The facts in the record show that Norma\n\nand Roy attempted to obtain a restraining order to stop the sale, but failed\n\nto obtain a valid restraining order, much less pay the bond established by\n\nthe court. When the restraining order route didn’t work, Norma next tried\n\nto convey her interest in the Property to Roy the day before he filed for\n\nbankruptcy (and listed the promissory note he owed to Norma as a debt on\n\nhis schedules). There is no evidence he ever paid the purchase price or the\n\nnote). Thus, there was a clear intent to shelter Norma’s interest in the\n\nProperty from her judgment creditor. These acts reek of fraud. This\n\nfraudulent conveyance, under Sections 24.02 and 24.03 of the Business &\n\nCommerce Code then in effect in 1980, rendered Norma’s conveyance to\n\nRoy void. Eckert, 40 S.W.2d at 797; Texas Sand Co., 381 S.W.2d at 54.\n\nTherefore, Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that Norma’s\n\nconveyance to Roy was legally valid. And if Norma’s conveyance was void,\n\nthen her purported conveyance to Roy passed no title that could become\n\npart of his bankruptcy estate.\n\n           2.    Norma’s interest didn’t pass to Roy, and thus, her\n                 interest in the Property was not a part of his\n                 bankruptcy estate or subject to the automatic\n                 stay.\n\n     As discussed above, Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n\nNorma’s conveyance to Roy was valid. Therefore, Sarah cannot establish as\n\n                                    29\n\fa matter of law that Norma’s interest in the Property was subject to the\n\nautomatic stay because if Norma’s interest didn’t pass to Roy, her separate\n\ninterest in the Property did not become part of his bankruptcy estate.\n\n          Generally, the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates a bankruptcy\n\nestate under § 541 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. § 541.6 And all\n\nproperty of the bankruptcy estate is subject to the automatic stay provision\n\nof § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n          But the automatic stay doesn’t apply to a non–debtor’s interest in\n\nproperty jointly owned with a debtor, unless the property is community\n\nproperty. For example, § 541(a)(1) states that “all legal or equitable\n\ninterests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case” is\n\nproperty of the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). This section doesn’t\n\napply to any legal or equitable interests of non–debtors. Id. In other words,\n\nNorma’s separate, undivided one–half interest in the Property was not a\n\npart of Roy’s bankruptcy estate. Id. This is confirmed by other sections of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code.\n\n          Under § 363 of the Code,7 if certain conditions exist, “the trustee may\n\nsell both the estate’s interest … and the interest of any co–owner in\n\n\n6 Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code in effect on September 1, 1980 is substantially\nsimilar to Section 541 in effect today. A copy of the 1978 Code is attached as Appx. 21.\n\n7   Id.\n                                          30\n\fproperty in which the debtor had, immediately before the commencement\n\nof the case, an undivided interest as a tenant in common, joint tenant, or\n\ntenant by the entirety.” 11 U.S.C. § 363(h). So, § 363(h) of the Code\n\nrecognizes the separate interests of the bankruptcy estate and non–debtor\n\nco–owners in jointly owned property. Id. This claim is further solidified by\n\n§ 363(j) of the Code, which states that, “[a]fter a sale of property to which [§\n\n363(h)] applies, the trustee shall distribute to the debtor’s spouse or the\n\nco–owners of such property, as the case may be, and to the estate, the\n\nproceeds of such sale, … according to the interests of such spouse or co–\n\nowners, and of the estate.” Id. § 363 (j). Thus, a non–debtor’s interest in\n\nproperty that he jointly owns with a bankruptcy debtor is not a part of the\n\ndebtor’s bankruptcy estate. Id.\n\n      Hankins’ position is supported by the caselaw, as courts have held\n\nthat real property held as joint tenants by spouses is not community\n\nproperty that would be included in one spouse’s separate bankruptcy estate.\n\nSee In re Berry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2020676\"><a href=\"/opinion/2020676/in-re-beery/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393–94 (D.

On the day he filed\n\nfor bankruptcy, Roy filed a motion for recognition of the automatic stay\n\n\n                                       31\n\fwith the bankruptcy court. That afternoon, the bankruptcy court granted\n\nRoy’s motion for recognition of the automatic stay. (1 Supp. CR at 433). But\n\nthe bankruptcy judge modified Roy’s proposed order, and ordered the\n\nfollowing:\n\n             It is therefore, ORDEDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\n             DECREED that the scheduled Constable Sale of the\n             real property located at 2922 Bellaire Boulevard,\n             Houston, Texas, or any interest therein owner the\n             Debtor is prohibited by the automatic stay …, and\n             that any further attempt to execute on the Debtor’s\n             property outside of the Bankruptcy Court … is\n             stayed pursuant to the provisions of Section 362\n             during the pendency of this case.\n\n(1 Supp. CR at 433) (additions by bankruptcy court emphasized).\n\n     As the Court can see, the bankruptcy court’s decision—that Norma’s\n\ninterest in the Property was not subject to the automatic stay—is in line\n\nwith Hankins’ assertion: Norma’s interest in the Property was not part of\n\nthe bankruptcy estate nor was it subject to the automatic stay because she\n\nowned a separate interest in joint property and was not the debtor or the\n\ndebtor’s spouse. Therefore, Hankins’ execution on Norma’s interest in the\n\nProperty was proper.\n\n\n\n\n                                     32\n\f           3.    Even if Norma’s interest in the Property were\n                 subject to the automatic stay, the Court should\n                 restore the parties to the status quo, revive\n                 Hankins’ judgment, and revive his judgment and\n                 execution liens.\n\n     Even if the bankruptcy stay were in effect and reached to Norma’s\n\nundivided one–half interest in the Property, there is no evidence that the\n\nbankruptcy discharge invalidated Hankins’ judgment lien or his execution\n\nlien on Norma’s undivided one–half interest in the Property. Nor is there\n\nany evidence that Roy’s bankruptcy discharge invalidated his levy on\n\nNorma’s interest in the Property. Therefore, even if the automatic stay\n\napplied and voided the execution sale, which Hankins disputes, Hankins’\n\njudgment and execution liens are still valid and enforceable.\n\n     In 1975, the Texas Legislature amended Title 90 of the Revised Civil\n\nStatutes of Texas by adding Article 5449(a), titled “Discharge of judgments\n\nand judgment liens against bankrupts.” Under Article 5449(a), §§ 1 and 4,\n\nRoy’s bankruptcy discharge would have invalidated Hankins’ judgment and\n\nexecution liens only if underlying judgment at issue was against Roy. TEX.\n\nREV. CIV. STAT. art. 5449(a) §§ (1, 4) Act of June 19, 1975, 64th Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 396, §§ 1, 4, 1975 Tex. Gen. Laws 1030, (Attached as Appx. 22)\n\n(emphases added) repealed by Act of 1983, 68th Leg., R.S., ch. 576, § 6,\n\n1983 Tex. Gen. Laws 3729, 3730. But Roy wasn’t the judgment debtor;\n\n\n                                     33\n\fNorma was the judgment debtor. (1 Supp. CR at 291–93). And it is\n\nundisputed that Norma never filed for bankruptcy protection. Because Roy\n\nwasn’t the judgment debtor, his discharge could not wipe out Hankins’ liens\n\nunder then–existing Texas law. TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. art. 4459(a)(1, 4). So,\n\nHankins’ judgment and executions liens, and the levy, are still in effect and\n\nenforceable.\n\n      Additionally, under settled Texas law, an execution lien is effective\n\nfrom the time of the levy and continues in effect until it is lost or\n\nabandoned, or in some way ceases to have vitality and effect.

Thus, even\n\nif the execution sale is set aside, Hankins’ execution lien, as evidenced by\n\nthe levy, would still be effective.

If a purchaser at an execution sale were subject to losing not only\n\nthe property that he won at the sale, but also the money he paid for the\n\nproperty, this would have a chilling effect on bidding at execution sales and\n\nwould result in lower prices that would be against the interests of judgment\n\ndebtors and the public. Id. at 903. Thus, Hankins’ judgment should be\n\nrevived to the extent it was satisfied from the proceeds of the sale; and the\n\njudgment creditor should be entitled to interest on the revived judgment as\n\nif the sale had not been held. Robin Russell and James W. Paulsen, 1 TEX.\n\nPRAC. GUIDE CREDITORS RIGHTS § 10:174 (2015). Also, any set–aside should\n\nrevive any liens on the property that were extinguished by the sale and the\n\nliens reattach to the property, with the same priority and effect as if there\n\nhad not been a sale. Id.\n\n      Therefore, even if the automatic stay applied, Roy’s discharge had no\n\neffect on Hankins’ judgment and execution liens. Thus, the trial court erred\n\n\n                                     35\n\fin granting Sarah’s motion for summary judgment and determining that\n\nHankins has “no interest” in the Property. And if even the automatic stay\n\napplied to void the execution sale, the parties should be returned to the\n\nstatus quo, with Hankins’ liens revived.8\n\n      D.     Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n             Hankins executed on homestead property. Rather, the\n             evidence shows that Hankins executed on Norma’s\n             undivided, one–half interest in the Property, which\n             she had abandoned.\n\n      Sarah also claims that the execution sale and thus, Hankins’ title\n\nunder that sale, is void because Roy’s homestead protection as to his\n\nundivided one–half interest in the Property protected the entirety of the\n\nProperty from the execution sale. Sarah is wrong.\n\n             1.     Limits on homestead protections do exist: The\n                    homestead protection doesn’t protect property\n                    interests that are not the debtor’s actual\n                    homestead.\n\n      While Texas homestead rights are expansive, they are not unlimited.\n\nWhile the courts have always given a liberal construction to the constitution\n\n8 It is anticipated that Sarah will argue that Hankins’ liens cannot be revived because he\nreleased any claims he may have had against Norma and Roy. (1 Supp. CR at 234–35).\nBut Sarah expressly didn’t move for summary judgment on the release. (Id. at 189, fn.6).\nBut it is undisputed that the general release was executed on March 3, 1981, more than\ntwo months before Roy’s received his discharge from the bankruptcy court. (Id. at\n234–35; 412). There is no evidence in the record that indicates whether the money paid\nto Hankins was not property of Roy’s bankruptcy estate. Nor is there any evidence the\nbankruptcy trustee approved the settlement. Under Sarah’s logic, such a transaction is\nvoid because it allegedly violated the automatic bankruptcy stay. Thus, if the Court were\ninclined to void the execution sale and restore the status quo, it should set aside the\ngeneral release as well, revive Hankins’ liens, and place the parties back at square one.\n                                           36\n\fand statutes to protect the homestead rights, it is clear the courts cannot\n\nprotect that which is not homestead.

But one spouse’s\n\nabandonment of the homestead does not expose the property to a forced\n\nsale because a homestead cannot be abandoned without the consent of the\n\nclaimant’s spouse—if the homestead claimant is married. TEX. PROP. CODE\n\n§41.004.\n\n     Here, Norma abandoned the Property. Roy and Norma stopped living\n\ntogether as husband and wife in March 1980. (2 Supp. CR at 1148).\n\nLikewise, Roy filed for divorce in March 1980. (Id. at 1148, 1213). At the\n\ntime the divorce was filed, Norma had vacated the Property and moved to\n\nBrownsville. (Id. at 1127–29). And Norma, at least between the time she\n\nseparated from Roy and her September 2, 1980 post–judgment deposition,\n\nhad moved to Brownsville with no intention of returning to the Property to\n\n\n                                     39\n\flive. (2 Supp. CR at 1113–15); Taylor, 777 S.W.2d at 569. Thus, as of the\n\ndate of the execution sale, Norma voluntarily left or quit the homestead,\n\nmoved to Brownsville, and did not intend to return to the Property to live.\n\nSee Pierce, 226 S.W.3d at 715. This constitutes an abandonment of Norma’s\n\nhomestead interest in the Property.\n\n     And Norma’s abandonment was effective on the date of divorce, June\n\n20, 1980. A similar abandonment issue involving a divorce was present in\n\nIn re Johnson. In Johnson, the court was “faced squarely with the issue of\n\nwhether two ex–spouses, both with fifty (50%) percent property interest in\n\na home, can each assert homestead rights even though both do not live in\n\nthe home. In re Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (E.D.

The debtor claimed that her one–half interest in the\n\nproperty was subject to the homestead protection even though she no\n\nlonger occupied the home. Id. The court disagreed. Id. The court held that\n\nthe ex–wife’s homestead interest in the marital home was lost as of the date\n\nshe (1) became divorced, and (2) ceased to occupy the home. Id. at 17.\n\n     The same result should apply here: Norma’s homestead interest in\n\nthe Property was lost as of date she (1) became divorced, and (2) abandoned\n\n\n                                      40\n\fthe Property. Therefore, as of June 20, 1980, the date of Norma’s divorce,\n\nshe no longer had a homestead interest in the Property, which dictates that\n\nHankins’ judgment lien attached to her undivided one–half interest and\n\nsubjected it to execution.

The judgment creditor then\n\nsought to execute on its judgment, just as Hankins did in this case. Id. The\n\nwife obtained an injunction against the execution on the Plano property,\n\nclaiming that the property was her homestead, as Roy did in this case. Id.\n\nThe judgment creditor, as Hankins did in this case, responded by asserting\n\n\n                                      42\n\fthat it was merely executing against the husband’s interest in the property.\n\nId.; (see also, 1 Supp. CR at 403) (levy and execution lien was against all of\n\nNorma’s “estate, right, title, and interest” in the Property).

While it\n\nwas unclear whether the husband had a homestead interest in the Plano\n\nhouse, the record established that the wife, as did Roy in this case, did have\n\na homestead interest. Id. at 212. But the court of appeals was not persuaded\n\nby this fact because the judgment creditor was not attempting to execute on\n\nthe wife’s homestead interest, but rather, the judgment creditor, like\n\nHankins here, was trying to execute on the husband’s non–homestead\n\ninterest. Id.; (see also, 1 Supp. CR at 403) (levy and execution lien was\n\nagainst all of Norma’s “estate, right, title, and interest” in the Property).\n\nThus, the court of appeals held that the judgment creditor was entitled to\n\nexecute on its judgment against the husband’s interest in the Plano house,\n\nsubject to the wife’s homestead interest in the property.

App.—Austin 2009, no pet.). A\n\njudgment was taken against the husband and abstracted 1992. Id. The\n\nhusband moved out of the homestead in 1997 and filed for divorce. Id. In\n\nJanuary 1998, the husband executed an agreement incident to the divorce,\n\nthe court signed the parties’ divorce decree, and the husband conveyed his\n\nundivided one–half interest in the homestead to his ex–wife. Id.\n\n     The husband’s creditor asserted that he had abandoned the\n\nhomestead and thus, the judgment lien attached to the property. Id. at 321.\n\nThe Austin Court of Appeals disagreed. Id. The court determined that the\n\ntiming and effect of the husband’s actions “were irrelevant because the\n\nproperty remained at all relevant times protected by [ex–wife’s] undivided\n\nhomestead interest in the property.” Id. Thus, despite recognizing the fact\n\nthat a lien attaches to property when it loses its homestead character, the\n\ncourt held that homestead property is wholly exempt from the attachment\n\nof judgment lien (other than those specifically listed in the Property Code)\n\nso long as the remaining spouse retains her homestead interest. Id. This\n\ncannot be the law for two reasons.\n\n     First, if one spouse wants to make the conscious choice to voluntarily\n\nleave and abandon their separately vested homestead rights, as opposed to\n\n\n                                     44\n\fdeath, incarceration, or other involuntary disposition, that abandonment\n\nshould have consequences, including the attachment of liens that wouldn’t\n\notherwise attach. One spouse’s abandonment doesn’t reduce the other\n\nspouse’s separately vested homestead rights. See Sayers, 161 S.W.2d at 773\n\n(one’s homestead right in property can never rise any higher than the right,\n\ntitle, or interest that the claimant owns in the property). Conversely, by\n\nallowing the spouse in possession to enjoy not only her homestead rights,\n\nbut also the separately vested homestead rights of her spouse who\n\nabandoned the homestead, means that one spouse can acquire a homestead\n\ninterest greater than the proportional right, title, or interest she owns. This\n\nis not the law.\n\n      Second, the Synnott holding (and Sarah’s position in this case), taken\n\nto its logical extreme, means that as long as one person maintains an\n\ninterest in homestead property, no matter how fractional (e.g., 1%), that\n\nfractional interest is sufficient to protect the entire property. This is\n\nproblematic because it is ripe for abuse. No family or single adult is allowed\n\nto have two homesteads at the same time under Texas law. Silvers v. Welch,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3911295\"><a href=\"/opinion/4147239/silvers-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (Tex. 1936). But under Synnott, a debtor could easily\n\nput assets out of the reach of creditors by granting family members\n\nfractional shares in rental homes and then have those family members (or\n\n\n                                      45\n\ffriends, or trusted tenants, or confidants) claim the homestead protection\n\nfor each property. In other words, even though the debtor’s rental\n\nproperties are not his homestead, they would be still be protected from\n\nexecution if anyone could claim any homestead interest in a piece of\n\nproperty. This is an extreme example, but it is exemplar of the absurdity\n\nthat could arise. Again, if an individual makes a conscious decision to\n\nabandon his homestead, then that interest should be available to creditors.\n\n           4.    Any claim by Sarah that Roy owned 100% of the\n                 Property on the execution date and thus, this\n                 interest protected the Property from the\n                 execution sale would lack merit.\n\n     It is anticipated that Sarah will claim that Norma’s purported\n\nconveyance to Roy on September merged their separate homestead\n\ninterests into Roy, and thus, the Property was protected from being\n\nexecuted upon.\n\n     If there is a dispute between the purchaser of property at an execution\n\nsale and one who contends the property was not subject to sale by virtue of\n\nhomestead rights, the issue is to be determined with reference to the status\n\nof the property at the time the execution was levied.

As discussed\n\nabove, Norma abandoned the homestead by moving to Brownsville with the\n\nintent of not returning, and this abandonment was effective on June 20,\n\n1980, the date her divorce was finalized. And as of the date of the levy,\n\nNorma had not yet conveyed or tried to convey her interest in the Property.\n\nSo, as of the date of the levy, Norma’s separate undivided one–half interest\n\nin the Property was not homestead and thus, it was subject to execution.\n\nAny attempt after the date of the levy to attach the homestead protection to\n\nNorma’s separate, undivided one–half interest in the Property is\n\nineffective. Ingle, 8 S.W. at 326.\n\n      E.    Sarah failed to establish any of adverse possession\n            claims as a matter of law.\n\n      Harris also claims that even if Hankins had an interest in the\n\nProperty, she adversely possessed that interest. Again, Sarah is wrong—she\n\nfailed to establish her claim of adverse possession as a matter of law.\n\n            1.    Overview of adverse possession in Texas.\n\n      The doctrine of adverse possession is based on statutes of limitation\n\nfor the recovery of real property. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 16.021–\n\n                                      47\n\f037. Thus, if there is a dispute concerning the possession of real property,\n\nthe rightful owner of the property must file suit within a specified period of\n\ntime (3, 5, 10, or 25 years, depending on various statutory factors and\n\nconditions) or be barred from recovering the property. Id. Not only are\n\nsuits for recovery of possession by the rightful owner barred, adverse\n\npossession provisions operate to vest the adverse claimant with title to the\n\nproperty. Id. at § 16.030(a). Thus, “[t]he concept of adverse possession\n\nallows a person to claim title to real property presently titled in another.”\n\nSession v.

At best, the earliest Sarah could have repudiated\n                    Hankins’ interest in the Property would have\n                    been March 8, 2005.\n\n      As discussed above, if Hankins acquired an interest in the Property,\n\nhe acquired Norma’s one–half undivided interest in the Property. Thus,\n\nHankins was a co–tenant or joint owner of the Property. So, in order for\n\nSarah to adversely possess Hankins’ interest, Sarah was required to prove—\n\nas a matter of law—that she or her predecessor clearly, unequivocally, and\n\nunmistakably repudiated Hankins’ interest in the common title to the\n\nProperty. Todd, 365 S.W.3d at 160; Dyer, 333 S.W.3d at 713. The statutory\n\nperiod does not begin to run on Sarah’s adverse possession claims until she\n\nshows she clearly, unequivocally, and unmistakably repudiated Hankins’\n\ninterest. Tex–Wis, 534 S.W.2d at 900.\n\n      At best, the earliest Sarah could have repudiated Hankins’ interest\n\nwould have been March 8, 2005, as discussed below. Yet, Sarah points to\n\ntwo letters written by her parents’ attorneys as evidence of repudiation of\n\nHankins’ title. Neither of these letters establishes that Sarah repudiated\n\nHankins’ interest as a matter of law on the dates they were sent. Neither the\n\nJuly 1984 letter nor the September 1990 letter can constitute—as a matter\n\n\n                                     50\n\fof law—a clear, unequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation by Sarah of\n\nHankins’ interest in the Property. See Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160. Sarah is not\n\nmentioned in either the July 1984 letter or the September 1990 letter. (1\n\nSupp. CR at 407–14; id. at 416–38). Nor is there any evidence that Matthew\n\nHoffman ever represented Sarah. Thus, Sarah cannot claim she repudiated\n\nHankins’ title as a matter of law through either letter.\n\n      Nor can Sarah claim that she can tack on her parents’ period of\n\nalleged adverse possession to her alleged period of possession. For tacking\n\nto be effective, Roy and Norma must have met all the requirements of\n\nadverse possession at the time they allegedly repudiated Hankins’ interest\n\nin the Property. BP Am. Prod.

Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895321\"><a href=\"/opinion/895321/bp-america-production-co-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (Tex.\n\n2011); TEX.

Sarah\n\ncould only tack on Norma and Roy’s alleged adverse possession to her\n\nclaimed period of possession if Roy or Norma owned the Property at the\n\ntime the letters were sent and then conveyed their interest to Sarah. But it\n\nis undisputed that neither Roy nor Norma owned any interest in the\n\nProperty when these two letters were sent, and thus, they cannot constitute\n\na repudiation of Hankins’ title by Sarah as a matter of law.\n\n\n                                      51\n\f      At best, Sarah can claim she repudiated Hankins’ title in March 2005,\n\nwhen she retained Thomas McCaffrey to send a letter to Hankins. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 439; 441–72). McCaffrey merely resent Hoffman’s letters, the\n\nattachments to the 1990 letter, and a letter from Hankins’ attorney in 1984.\n\n(Id. at 441–72). McCaffrey didn’t claim that Sarah Harris was repudiating\n\nHankins’ interest in the property, nor does he state why he sent the letter.\n\n(Id. at 439–72). Thus, the March 2005 letter doesn’t establish a clear,\n\nunequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n            4.    Sarah’s alternative bases for establishing\n                  repudiation are also insufficient to establish\n                  repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n      Sarah also claims two alternative bases for establishing repudiation of\n\nHankins’ interest in the Property. Neither basis establishes the requisite\n\nclear, unequivocal, and unmistakable repudiation of common title as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n      Sarah claims repudiation because her family’s possession had been\n\n“so long continued, open, notorious, exclusive, and inconsistent with the\n\nexistence of title” in Hankins that there is an inference of notice. (1 Supp.\n\nCR at 198). Harris cited no evidence in support of this claim. (Id.).\n\nRegardless, this alternative basis doesn’t apply in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                      52\n\f      In Tex–Wis, the Texas Supreme Court held that a “jury [may] infer\n\nnotice of a repudiation without any change in the use of the land,” if there\n\nhas been “long–continued use.” Tex–Wis Co. v.

Knight, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3941336\"><a href=\"/opinion/4173731/moore-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1139–40 (Tex. 1936)).\n\n      In this case, Harris cites no evidence in support of her claim that her\n\nfamily’s possession had been “so long continued, open, notorious, exclusive,\n\nand inconsistent with the existence of title” in Hankins that there is an\n\ninference of notice. (1 Supp. CR at 198). Regardless, it is undisputed that\n\nHankins consistently asserted claims to the Property—that is why the\n\nHarris family continually hired attorneys to refute his claims. (See 1 Supp.\n\n\n                                       53\n\fCR at 407–14; id. at 416–38; id. at 439; 441–72). Thus, Sarah failed to\n\nestablish this alternative basis for repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n      Sarah also claimed that repudiation was established by her accepting\n\na deed purporting to convey to her the fee simple interest in the Property. (1\n\nSupp. CR at 198). This Court recently rejected a similar claim. Dyer v.\n\nCotton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2281330\"><a href=\"/opinion/2281330/dyer-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.)\n\n(the party claiming adverse possession, who owned a 1/7 undivided interest\n\nin the property, could not rely on an erroneous deed conveying the entire\n\nfee simple estate to him as evidence of repudiation as to the other co–\n\ntenants). Thus, any purported fee simple conveyance to Sarah after\n\nHankins acquired his title cannot establish repudiation as a matter of law.\n\n            5.    Sarah cannot establish adverse possession under\n                  either the 10–year or 25–year limitation period\n                  because the applicable time periods have not yet\n                  elapsed.\n\n      If the March 8, 2005 letter was a repudiation of Hankins’ title and\n\nthus, constitutes the accrual date for Sarah’s adverse possession claims, her\n\nclaims under the 10–year and 25–year limitation periods must fail because\n\nthose periods of possession haven’t lapsed.\n\n      Again, at best, the earliest Sarah could claim she repudiated Hankins’\n\ntitle would be March 8, 2005, when McCaffrey sent his letter to Hankins’\n\nattorney. (1 Supp. CR at 238). Thus, her claim for adverse possession under\n\n                                      54\n\fthe 10–year and 25–year limitation periods would not ripen until March 8,\n\n2015, and March 8, 2030, respectively. But once possession of real property\n\nis interrupted by an adverse suit to recover the property, the requisite\n\npeaceable possession no longer exists. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§16.021(3). In this case, Sarah filed suit on January 13, 2014—before the\n\n10–year and 25–year limitation periods had expired. (CR at 4–15). And\n\nHankins filed his counterclaim on February 4, 2014—also before the 10–\n\nyear and 25–year limitation periods had expired. (Id. at 16–40). Thus,\n\npeaceable possession was interrupted, and as such, Sarah did not (and\n\ncould not) establish her claim for adverse possession as a matter of law\n\nunder either the 10–year or 25–year limitation periods.\n\n            6.    Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                  possession under the 3–year limitation period as\n                  a matter of law.\n\n      The 3–year statute of limitation states the suit “to recover real\n\nproperty held by another in peaceable and adverse possession under title or\n\ncolor of title” must be brought “not later than three years after the day the\n\ncause of action accrues.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 16.024. “Title” is\n\ndefined as a regular chain of transfers of real property from or under the\n\nsovereignty of the soil. Id. at § 16.024. The chain is said to be under “color\n\nof title” when the chain is complete, but necessarily perfect, but not\n\n\n                                     55\n\f“wanting of intrinsic fairness or honesty.” Id. at § 16.021. Therefore, to\n\nprevail under the 3–year limitation period, Sarah was required to prove—as\n\na matter of law—title from the sovereignty. Id. Sarah wholly failed to do so.\n\n(1 Supp. CR at 179–508). Therefore, Sarah failed to establish her claim for\n\nadverse possession under the 3–year limitation period regardless of when\n\nshe allegedly repudiated Hankins’ interest in the Property.\n\n            7.    Sarah did not establish her claim for adverse\n                  possession under the 5–year and 10–year\n                  limitation periods as a matter of law.\n\n       The 5–year limitation period requires the owner to bring suit within\n\nfive years to recover property held by another in peaceable and adverse\n\npossession who cultivates, uses, or enjoys the property, pays taxes, and\n\nclaims under a duly registered deed. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§16.025(a). The 10–year statute of limitation requires suit “to recover real\n\nproperty held in peaceable and adverse possession by another who\n\ncultivates, uses, or enjoys the property.” Id. at §16.026(a). Thus, both\n\nlimitation periods require that the adverse possession claimant cultivate,\n\nuse, or enjoy the land. Sarah failed to establish this element as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       Here, Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that she cultivated,\n\nused, or enjoyed the land in a manner that was (1) actual and visible, (2)\n\n\n                                      56\n\fcommended and continued under a claim of right that is inconsistent and\n\nhostile to the claim of another person, and (3) continuous and not\n\ninterrupted. Sarah failed to establish these elements as a matter of law.\n\n      As an initial matter, the evidence is disputed with regard to whether\n\nSarah’s possession was actual, visible, continuous, and uninterrupted.\n\nPossession of the claimed property must also be consistent and continuous,\n\nuninterrupted by temporary vacancy, unless duration of vacancy is\n\nreasonable under existing circumstances that reasonably show the adverse\n\nclaimant did not thereby intend to abandon the premises.

(2 Supp. CR at 1144, Interrogatory No.\n\n15). Also, Roy passed away in 1999, and Norma passed away in 2005. (1\n\nSupp. CR at 260–61). Thus, neither Roy nor Norma has been in actual,\n\nvisible, continuous, and uninterrupted possession of the Property since\n\nMarch 8, 2005. And Hankins testified that, despite visiting the Property\n\n“hundreds of times,” he has never seen Roy, Norma, or Sarah at the\n\nProperty nor did ever see any signs that someone was occupying the\n\nProperty. (2 Supp. CR at 1158, ¶ 3; (2 Supp. CR at 937–38). Therefore,\n\nSarah failed to establish as a matter of law that her possession was actual,\n\nvisible, open, continuous, and uninterrupted.\n\n     Nor does Sarah’s evidence of cultivation, use, and enjoyment of the\n\nProperty establish her adverse possession claim as a matter of law. Again,\n\nthe earliest Sarah could claim she repudiated Hankins’ title would have\n\nbeen March 8, 2005. Thus, her period of alleged adverse possession could\n\nnot begin until March 8, 2005. Tex–Wis, 534 S.W.2d at 900; McLaren, 811\n\n\n                                    58\n\fS.W.2d at 568. So, her alleged evidence regarding Roy’s alleged occupancy\n\nof the Property through his death in 1999 and Norma’s alleged occupancy\n\nof the Property through her death in 2005 is insufficient to establish\n\nadverse possession under either the five–year or ten–year limitation\n\nperiod. Simply, neither Roy nor Norma were alive and thus, able to use the\n\nProperty for the statutorily required period after Sarah’s alleged\n\nrepudiation. And anything they did or may have done before Sarah\n\nallegedly repudiated Hankins’ interest in March 2005 is legally irrelevant\n\nand insufficient.\n\n      Nor    does   Sarah’s    alleged evidence      of maintaining     utilities,\n\nmaintaining insurance, having discussions to sell the Property, making\n\nimprovements on the Property, or landscaping and maintaining the\n\nProperty constitute cultivation, use, and enjoyment of the Property that\n\nwould give a co–tenant such Hankins’ notice of her adverse possession\n\nclaim for several reasons.\n\n      First, the maintaining of utilities, keeping the property insured,\n\nmaking      improvements      on   the   property,   and   performing   general\n\nmaintenance is, without more, legally insufficient to establish an adverse\n\npossession claim against a co–tenant. In Todd, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nheld that “if the acts of the respondents and their predecessors in title are\n\n\n                                         59\n\fsusceptible of explanation consistent with the existence of the common title\n\nthen such acts cannot … give constructive notice to the co–tenants out of\n\npossession.” Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160. Instead, adverse claimant must\n\nprove actual or constructive notice of the ouster, and the clear, unequivocal,\n\nand unmistakable repudiation of the common title. Todd, 365 S.W.2d at\n\n160; Dyer, 333 S.W.3d at 713. Sarah’s usage of the Property is nothing more\n\nthan merely undertaking and performing tasks consistent with a co–\n\ntenancy, which is insufficient to establish adverse possession as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       Second, merely paying the taxes on property and attempting to find\n\nbuyers for the property have been deemed insufficient to establish an\n\nadverse possession claim. See Jones v. Ford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2463561\"><a href=\"/opinion/2463561/jones-v-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 824 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—El Paso 1979, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Even if one co–tenant pays taxes on\n\nthe entire property, possession coupled with payment of taxes is not notice\n\nto a co–tenant of repudiation of common title. Sebesta, 812 S.W.2d at 645\n\n(citing Todd, 365 S.W.2d at 160).\n\n       Third, Sarah’s alleged landscaping and maintenance of the Property is\n\nlikewise insufficient to establish an adverse possession claim as a matter of\n\nlaw. The Supreme Court of Texas has held that the mere cutting of weeds is\n\ninsufficient to constitute use of property to meet the requirements for\n\n\n                                     60\n\fadverse possession.

As an\n\ninitial matter, Hankins objected to the invoices and bills attached as Exhibit\n\nNumbers 2, 8, and 9 to Sarah’s affidavit because these documents were not\n\nauthenticated and because they were hearsay. (2 Supp. CR at 867, 870).\n\nThe court overruled the objections. (CR at 227). This was error, as Sarah\n\nfailed to authenticate these documents or lay any foundation for their\n\nadmissibility. Thus, they are inadmissible hearsay that must be excluded.\n\nEven if the Court were to consider these documents, they fall short of\n\n\n\n\n                                      61\n\festablishing actual, visible, open, and continuous possession of the\n\nProperty for the statutory limitation periods.\n\n      Here, the insurance statements attached by Sarah to her motion for\n\nsummary judgment were for the policy period of March 31, 2006 through\n\nMarch 31, 2007. (1 Supp. CR at 241–45). Sarah attached no other insurance\n\nstatements, certificates, or policies for any other year of her claimed\n\nadverse possession. (Id.). Likewise, the “utility bills” Sarah attached to her\n\nmotion for summary judgment were for a single year, 2006. (Id. at 262–\n\n76). Furthermore, the landscaping invoices Sarah attached to her motion\n\nfor summary judgment included one invoice in 2009, two invoices in 2010,\n\nand one invoice in 2012. (1 Supp. CR at 277–86). This evidence, even if\n\nadmissible, is insufficient to establish adverse possession as a matter of law.\n\n      F.     Sarah failed to establish as a matter of law that\n             Hankins’ counterclaims for conversion, partition, and\n             trespass to try title are barred as a matter of law.\n\n      Sarah filed a second motion for summary judgment, in which she\n\nchallenged Hankins’ counterclaims. (2 Supp. CR at 1240–55). In this\n\nsecond motion for summary judgment, Sarah claimed, inter alia,9 that\n\nHankins’ claim for conversion failed as a matter of law. (Id.). Specifically,\n\nSarah claimed that Hankins’ conversion claim failed because he allegedly\n\n\n9 Hankins is not challenging the trial court’s grant of summary judgment on his claims\nfor declaratory relief, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment.\n                                          62\n\fnever obtained any interest in the property and thus, he was never a co–\n\ntenant. (Id. at 1244). Sarah’s challenge to Hankins’ counterclaim for\n\nconversion was a rehash of her first summary judgment argument: Hankins\n\npurportedly has no claim because he never acquired any interest in the\n\nProperty. Sarah is wrong. Hankins reurges, but will not rehash the\n\narguments he asserts in Sections B, C, and D of this brief, which detail how\n\nhe acquired an interest in the Property and how the trial court erred in\n\ndetermining that he had no interest in the Property. The trial court’s\n\nsummary judgment disposing of Hankins’ conversion claim must be\n\nreversed.\n\n     It also must be noted that Sarah’s second motion for summary\n\njudgment didn’t specifically challenge Hankins’ claims for trespass to try\n\ntitle and partition. To the extent these claims were disposed of because the\n\ntrial court’s earlier summary judgment ruling, this disposition must be\n\nreversed. For the reasons set forth in Section E above, Sarah failed to\n\nestablish her adverse possession claim as a matter of law. Hankins reurges,\n\nbut will not rehash the arguments he asserts in Section E of this brief,\n\nwhich detail how Sarah failed to carry her burden of proof to establish her\n\nright to summary judgment as a matter of law. If the trial court’s summary\n\njudgment on Sarah’s adverse possession claim is reversed, then her second\n\n\n                                    63\n\fmotion for summary judgment. Likewise, if the trial court’s finding that\n\nHankins owns no interest in the Property is reversed, Hankins requests that\n\nhis claims for trespass to try title and partition be reinstated and remanded.\n\n                         Conclusion and Prayer\n\n      The trial court erred in granting Sarah’s motions for summary\n\njudgment. At a minimum, Hankins’ judgment and execution liens are still\n\neffective and thus, he has an interest in the Property. And even if the Court\n\nwere inclined to affirm the voiding of the execution sale, equity warrants\n\nreviving Hankins’ judgment and his liens. Hankins therefore requests that\n\nthe Court reverse the trial court’s grant of summary judgments in favor of\n\nSarah Harris, reverse the final judgment, and remand this matter back to\n\nthe trial court.\n\n                                    Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                    LEYH, PAYNE & MALLIA, PLLC\n\n\n                                    By: /s/ Sean M.
