Douglas appeals from the order denying his pro\nse petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n2254. Mr. Douglas contends that the District Court failed to apply\nthe correct standard of review pursuant to the terms of the Anti-\nTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”). He also\nargues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because (1)\nhe was denied a speedy trial, (2) his counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to pursue his right to a speedy trial, and (3) he was\neffectively denied his right to counsel because he was\nunrepresented at a critical stage of the proceedings while he was in\ncustody on capital charges. We will affirm because we conclude\nthat the District Court applied the correct standard of review in\ndetermining that the Appellate Division’s decision was not\n“contrary to, [or did not involve] an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n                                 I\n       On August 7, 1987, Estella and Charlene Moore lived\ntogether with Charlene’s infant daughter in Apartment 2E in a\n\n                                 2\n\fbuilding in East Orange, New Jersey. Mr. Douglas, whose\nnickname is “Skeet” lived next door to the Moore sisters in\nApartment 2D. Georgianna Broadway and Deborah Neal lived\ntogether nearby in Newark, New Jersey. Ms. Broadway and Ms.\nNeal were friends of the Moore sisters. Ms. Broadway was\nintroduced to Mr. Douglas through the Moore sisters.\n        In late July or early August of 1987, Ms. Broadway had\nlunch with the Moore sisters at their apartment. She stayed about\nforty-five minutes. Mr. Douglas was also in Apartment 2E at the\nsame time. After repairing the front door of Apartment 2E, Mr.\nDouglas and the Moore sisters sat in the living room area\nconversing and consuming mixed drinks. Ms. Broadway sat\napproximately twenty feet away in the kitchen area listening to Mr.\nDouglas’s conversation with the Moore sisters as she ate her lunch.\n        On the evening of August 7, 1987, Ms. Broadway visited\nthe Moore sisters in Apartment 2E. At approximately 5:30 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 1987, Charlene Moore and Ms. Broadway went to sleep\nin the bedroom. Mervin Matthews, a friend of the Moore sisters,\narrived at their apartment building at around 6:00 a.m. to drop off\nEstella Moore’s keys and cigarettes. As he approached the\nbuilding, Mr. Matthews saw Mr. Douglas standing outside the\nentrance talking to another gentleman. Mr. Matthews greeted Mr.\nDouglas. The two men went upstairs together; Mr. Matthews\nentered the Moores’ apartment, while Mr. Douglas entered his own\napartment. About fifteen minutes later, when Mr. Matthews left\nthe Moores’ apartment, Mr. Douglas also exited his apartment and\njoined Mr. Matthews as he walked down the stairs. When Mr.\nMatthews left that morning, Mr. Douglas was standing outside the\napartment building.\n        Kenneth Hampton, an acquaintance of Mr. Douglas’s who\nneeded a place to stay, spent the night of August 7, 1987 at Mr.\nDouglas’s apartment. At around 6:45 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., Mr.\nHampton left the apartment to go outside and catch a ride to work.\nHe saw Mr. Douglas sitting alone on the front stoop of the\napartment building. The two men spoke briefly and Mr. Hampton\nran to the corner to catch his ride.\n       Ms. Broadway awakened some time around 7:00 a.m. or\n7:30 a.m. and heard Estella Moore speaking to Mr. Douglas in the\nkitchen area. Ms. Broadway asked Charlene Moore to bring her\n\n                                3\n\fMs. Broadway’s pocketbook and keys from the kitchen. Charlene\nMoore complied. Ms. Broadway asked Estella Moore to prepare\na meal for her. Estella Moore brought Ms. Broadway a tray of\nChinese food. Ms. Broadway noticed that Estella Moore had “a\nvery scared look on her face” when she entered the bedroom. Ms.\nBroadway asked Estella Moore “what was wrong.” Estella replied,\n“Nothing. Nothing.”\n       A few minutes later, the bedroom door was pushed open and\nsix shots were fired in rapid succession. Ms. Broadway did not see\nthe perpetrator. She received bullet wounds under her chin and on\nher right arm. She also was grazed by bullets on her chest and\nthumb. The Moore sisters died instantly from close range bullet\nwounds. After determining that the sisters were dead, Ms.\nBroadway saw the baby’s foot move. The baby was unharmed.\nMs. Broadway placed the baby inside her coat.\n       Ms. Broadway waited for up to thirty minutes to leave the\napartment building because she was unsure of the perpetrator’s\nwhereabouts. She drove herself to her residence. When she\nentered the apartment, she told Ms. Neal: “Skeet just shot all three\nof us and Stella and Charlene is [sic] dead.” Ms. Neal telephoned\nthe East Orange Police Department to report the homicides. She\nindicated that “Skeet,” the occupant of Apartment 2D, was a\npossible suspect.\n       Officer Alfred Rizzolo arrived at Ms. Broadway’s residence\nat 9:35 a.m. on August 8, 1987. Ms. Broadway was being treated\nby emergency medical service personnel. She appeared to be\nnervous, excited, and in a lot of pain. Ms. Broadway told Officer\nRizzolo that “Skeet” had shot her while she was at Apartment 2E\nand that “there were two dead bodies in that apartment.”\n       Sergeant Michael Brown, Officer Ronald Tisdale, and\nOfficer Ben Powell of the East Orange Police Department\nresponded to the dispatcher’s call about a double homicide in\nApartment 2E. Sergeant Brown was also informed that the\nperpetrator might be in Apartment 2D. Finding the door of\nApartment 2E ajar, the officers entered and discovered Estella and\nCharlene Moore lying on the bedroom floor. Each of them had\nmultiple gunshot wounds. The officers did not find any other\nperson or weapons in the bedroom. They recovered a round of\nammunition under a radiator in the bedroom.\n\n                                 4\n\f       The officers discovered the door of Apartment 2D ajar.\nThey entered in order to perform a plain-view search for weapons\nand/or persons. Captain John Armeno of the East Orange Police\nDepartment arrived at Apartment 2D at 10:00 a.m. He conducted\na search for weapons or “any other thing of evidentiary value.” He\nbelieved it was important to identify the perpetrator quickly.\nCaptain Armeno removed a photograph of a man from Apartment\n2D. The building’s manager identified the man in the photograph\nas Mr. Douglas.\n       Sergeant Ronald Sepe of the East Orange Police Department\ntook the photograph to the University Hospital where Ms.\nBroadway was being treated for her gunshot wounds. Sergeant\nSepe showed the photograph to Ms. Broadway and asked her if the\nman in photograph was the person who shot her. Ms. Broadway\nnodded her head and told Sergeant Sepe: “Yes.”\n       Warrants for the arrest of Mr. Douglas and the search of his\napartment were executed later that day. The search of Mr.\nDouglas’s apartment yielded “[a]n Ohaus tripple beam scale, a\nDerring gram scale, one hand held scale, glass bowl pipe, single\nedge razor, one spoon with residue, another spoon with residue,\none bag of suspect marijuana, one bag of suspect marijuana seed,\none pack of suspect cocaine, one black leather holster, two black\nleather cestus and one beige Rolodex file.” The Rolodex included\nthe name Irving Gaskins.\n        The next day, on August 9, 1987, eleven police officers\nwent to Mr. Gaskins’s apartment in Newark, New Jersey to locate\nMr. Douglas. Sergeant Sepe, Sergeant Alan Sierchio and four\nother police officers from the East Orange Police Department, were\nassisted by Sergeant Charles Whitner of the Newark, New Jersey\nPolice Department Tactical Unit; Officer Wayne Dooley, Officer\nGeorge Davey and Officer Thomas Hughes, also of the Newark\nPolice Department. Sergeants Sepe, Sierchio and Whitner, along\nwith Officers Hughes, Dooley and Davey, walked up to the third\nfloor apartment. Sergeant Whitner knocked on the door. They\nwere admitted by Bonita Allen who indicated that Mr. Douglas was\nin the living room.\n      Upon entering the apartment, the officers observed Mr.\nDouglas sitting on the couch in the living room. Sergeant Sepe,\nSergeant Whitner, Sergeant Sierchio, and Officer Dooley\n\n                                5\n\fapproached Mr. Douglas in the living room. Mr. Douglas stood up\nas the officers approached him. Mr. Gaskins was seated in the\nliving room on a chair near the couch. Sergeant Sepe placed Mr.\nDouglas under arrest. Sergeant Whitner handcuffed Mr. Douglas\nfrom behind while Sergeant Sepe, who was face-to-face with Mr.\nDouglas, performed a protective search. When searching Mr.\nDouglas, Sergeant Sepe came across a hard object and announced\nthat he had found a gun. Sergeant Sierchio moved in closer and\nobserved Sergeant Sepe lift Mr. Douglas’s shirt and seize a fully\nloaded six shot Spesco Taurus .38 caliber revolver from “the front\nportion of his pants in the waistband area.” The six rounds in the\nweapon were hollow-point bullets. Sergeant Whitner, Officer\nHughes, and Officer Davey also observed Sergeant Sepe remove\nthe weapon from Mr. Douglas’s waistband area. Sergeant Sierchio\nobserved Sergeant Sepe remove an additional five rounds of\nammunition, also hollow-point bullets, from Mr. Douglas’s right\nfront pocket. Prior to patting him down, Sergeant Sepe did not see\nthe weapon or a bulge in Mr. Douglas’s pants. The weapon was\nentirely concealed from view because Mr. Douglas’s shirt was\nhanging down over his waistband.\n        The gun holster located in Apartment 2D bore unique\nstriation marks matching those found on the weapon recovered\nfrom Mr. Douglas at the time of his arrest. Captain Carl Leisinger,\na ballistics expert, testified that the bullets recovered from the\nbodies of the Moore sisters and the spent round recovered in\nApartment 2E were fired from the revolver carried by Mr. Douglas\nat the time of his arrest. Captain Leisinger also testified that the\nrevolver seized from Mr. Douglas had unique striation marks cut\ninto the flutes of the outside cylinder. This is the only revolver\nCaptain Leisinger had seen, in examining tens of thousands of\nrevolvers, that had this particular type of fluting. These unique\nstriation marks were plainly imprinted on the black leather holster\nfound in Mr. Douglas’s apartment.\n                                 A\n       Ollie Douglas, an Assistant Deputy Public Defender\n(“ADPD”) with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender for\nEssex County (“OPD”), was appointed to represent Mr. Douglas on\nAugust 12, 1987, three days after he was arrested. At the time of\nhis appointment to represent Mr. Douglas, ADPD Douglas had\n\n                                 6\n\fserved as an Assistant Deputy Public Defender for fourteen years.\nHe had tried two or three capital cases. After interviewing Mr.\nDouglas, ADPA Douglas requested that a field investigation be\nconducted, rather than telephone contacts, with several individuals\nwhom Mr. Douglas disclosed might be witnesses to support his\ndefense. The list of prospective witnesses that Mr. Douglas\nsuggested should be questioned in person included Mr. Gaskins,\nSheila Tucker, and Michael Tucker.\n        On October 14, 1987, Mr. Douglas was charged with two\ncounts of murder, aggravated assault, possession of a handgun\nwithout a permit, and possession of a firearm for an unlawful\npurpose in violation of New Jersey law. ADPD Douglas\nrepresented Mr. Douglas at his arraignment on November 18, 1987.\nMr. Douglas entered a not guilty plea. Pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 3:7-\n3(c), the State served a notice of aggravating factors which, if\nproven at the penalty phase, would make Mr. Douglas eligible for\nthe death penalty. Deputy Public Defender (“DPD”) Mayer\nWinograd, the head of the Essex County OPD, was also assigned\nto represent Mr. Douglas. ADPD Douglas and DPD Winograd met\nwith Mr. Douglas several times while he was in jail.\n       On January 21, 1988, DPD Winograd informed Mr. Douglas\nthat the OPD had conducted a financial investigation and\ndetermined that he was ineligible for legal representation by the\nOPD.1 In its investigation, the OPD discovered that Mr. Douglas\nowned a house with a market value of $70,000 to $110,000,\ndepending on its condition. Similar houses in the immediate area\nhad recently sold for $90,000 and $125,000. DPD Winograd\nadvised Mr. Douglas that he had “a right to Appeal to the Appellate\nDivision which has exclusive jurisdiction” over the determination\nthat he was not entitled to the appointment of counsel based on\nindigency. In his letter to Mr. Douglas, DPD Winograd cited State\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        The OPD’s representation was terminated pursuant to\nN.J. Stat. Ann. § 2A:158A-15.1. At that time, §2A:158A-15.1\nprovided that the OPD was responsible for determining whether\nan accused was entitled to appointed counsel because of\nindigency.\n\n                                7\n\fv. Nilsen, 214 N.J. Super. 23 (1986).2 A copy of the letter was sent\nto Judge Joseph A. Falcone, on January 28, 1988.\n        On February 2, 1988, Mr. Douglas appeared before Judge\nFalcone without counsel. Judge Falcone informed Mr. Douglas of\nhis right to appeal the OPD’s decision to terminate his\nrepresentation. Judge Falcone requested that Mr. Douglas advise\nthe court in writing of any developments of his attempts to\npersuade the OPD that he was entitled to the appointment of\ncounsel. Judge Falcone also advised Mr. Douglas to consider State\nv. Nilsen, 214 N.J. Super. 23 (1986) in deciding whether to pursue\nhis claim that he was eligible for the appointment of counsel\nbecause he was indigent.\n       ADPD Douglas provided Mr. Douglas with the name and\naddress of James Smith, the deputy public defender “charged with\nhandling appeals in [the OPD’s] appellate section,” along with a\nnotice of appeal form to facilitate an appeal of the denial of\nrepresentation. In a letter dated February 8, 1988, Mr. Douglas\nwrote to DPD Smith declaring that he challenged the OPD’s\ndetermination that he was not eligible for representation.\n        During his next court appearance on February 16, 1988, Mr.\nDouglas informed Judge Falcone that he had corresponded with\nDPD Smith but had received no reply. Judge Falcone again\ninformed him of his right to appeal from the decision denying his\neligibility for the appointment of counsel and scheduled the next\nappearance on March 21, 1988. He also advised Mr. Douglas that\n\n\n       2\n        Nilsen holds that “the Public Defender was vested with\nthe authority to determine the eligibility of applicants for\nservice.” Nilsen, 214 N.J. Super. at 25 (citing N.J. Stat. Ann. §\n2A:158A-1.) In Nilsen, the court explained that the New Jersey\nlegislature “vest[ed] in the Public Defender the exclusive\nauthority to determine whether a defendant who has been\nindicted is indigent and eligible for representation by the Office\nof the Public Defender.” Id. at 26. The Nilsen court also\nexplained that “[i]f [a] rejected applicant wishes to contest the\nrejection, he or she should file an appeal with the Appellate\nDivision [of the Superior Court] pursuant to R. 2:2-3(a)(2).” Id.\nat 27 (citing N.J. Ct. R. 2:2-3).\n\n                                 8\n\fhe should inform the court in writing of any developments in his\nappeal from the refusal of the OPD to represent him.\n      When the matter came before the court on March 21, 1988,\nand again on April 19, 1988, Mr. Douglas appeared without\ncounsel. At the April 19, 1988 hearing, Judge Falcone provided\nMr. Douglas with a copy of the Nilsen opinion which set forth the\nproper procedure for appealing the OPD’s non-indigency\ndetermination.\n       On May 16, 1988, Mr. Douglas wrote to New Jersey Public\nDefender Alfred A. Slocum, seeking review of the OPD’s non-\nindigency determination. He explained to Mr. Slocum that Judge\nFalcone had informed him at the April 19, 1988 hearing that DPD\nSmith was not authorized to represent him in an appeal from the\ndecision of the OPD that he was not an indigent entitled to\nappointed counsel. He further stated that his inability to receive\nenvelopes and stamps at the county jail, or use their photocopying\nequipment, had prevented him from contacting Mr. Slocum until\nthe date of the letter.\n        At a subsequent court appearance on June 14, 1988, Judge\nFalcone informed Mr. Douglas that he should submit his appeal of\nthe denial of appointed counsel to the Appellate Division of the\nSuperior Court. That same day, Mr. Douglas wrote to Elizabeth\nMcLaughlin of the Clerk’s Office of the Superior Court of New\nJersey, Appellate Division, seeking review of the determination\nthat he was not an indigent. He stated in his letter that the property\nhe owned was worth very little because it had been damaged by\nfire and was in need of extensive repairs. Mr. Douglas also\ninformed Ms. McLaughlin that the cost of repairs would be\n$20,000, and that there was a mortgage on the property in the\namount of $8,379.60, as well as water and sewage liens in the\namount of $565.62 plus interest.\n       Section 2A:158A-15.1 was amended, effective on April 3,\n1988. As amended, it transferred the determination regarding\nwhether a defendant is indigent from the OPD to the court. Mr.\nDouglas was informed of this fact by Public Defender Slocum in\na letter dated June 20, 1988. Referring to the then recent\namendment to N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-2, Mr. Slocum wrote that:\n\n\n\n                                  9\n\f                 Effective April 5, 1988 by virtue of\n                 newly enacted legislation, the Office\n                 of the Public Defender was relieved of\n                 the responsibility of determining\n                 indigency. This determination is now\n                 made by the judiciary. Even if you\n                 were to successfully appeal Mr.\n                 Winograd’s determination, the Office\n                 of the Public Defender would not be\n                 able to decide whether you are\n                 indigent or not.\n\n\n                 You should immediately write to the\n                 Essex County Criminal Case Manager\n                 requesting that they provide you with\n                 an application for representation by\n                 the Office of the Public Defender. If\n                 they determine that you are eligible\n                 for our services, we will again\n                 undertake your representation.\n\n\n        On July 11, 1988, Jack Trubenbach, Clerk of the Superior\nCourt of New Jersey, Appellate Division, wrote to Mr. Douglas\ninforming him that his appeal of the denial of court appointed\ncounsel was rejected for failure to attach the appropriate\ndocuments. On July 25, 1988, Mr. Douglas wrote to Judge Falcone\nto inform the court of his lack of progress in obtaining counsel. He\ncomplained that he was misled by ADPD Douglas as to what was\nrequired for a successful appeal, and expressed general concern\nover the progress of his case. He also explained the difficulties he\nhad experienced obtaining access to the library, to a copy machine,\nand other resources necessary for his appeal of the OPD’s denial of\nrepresentation, due to his incarceration and placement in protective\ncustody.3\n\n\n        3\n            Mr. Douglas’s July 25, 1988 letter stated, in relevant\npart:\n\n\n                                  10\n\f        The information forwarded to me by Mr.\nTrubenbach makes me painfully aware of the\nmisleading and erroneous “advise” given to me by\nmy former Public Defender, Mr. Ollie Douglas,\nEsquire, vis a vis the nature and amount of\ninformation required concerning the appellate\nprocedures. I am shocked than an attorney with\nthe experience and expertise of Mr. Ollie Douglas\nwould inform me that a letter would be sufficient,\nas if that is all that is required, in such a\ncomplicated matter as the appellate process.\n\nI am very concerned about these proceedings and I\nhave to wonder as to the intention and/or motive\nconsidering that type and quality of representation\nafforded me during the time I was being\nrepresented by the Office of the Public Defender . .\n..\n\nAlso, I am curious that had I not mistakenly mailed\nthe letter that I sent to Mr. Slocum, would I have\nbeen informed of the change in the legislation\nsince the change occurred April 5, 1988 . . . .\n\nAs I had stated in previous correspondence, I am in\nAdministrative Segregation Protective Custody in\nthe Essex County Jail wherein I am allowed out of\nmy cell one hour during the day and one hour in\nthe evening. From June 23, 1988 through July 22,\n1988, the telephone was removed from the tier.\nFor two weeks prior to that the telephone was out\nof order. Also, as stated previously, access to the\nLaw Library is limited to one day a week for one\nhour. Often library is cancelled, so we have had\naccess to the library on the average of once a\nmonth. They copying machine has been operable\nonly twice on the days I have been able to go to the\nlibrary since May, requiring my continuing to have\nto send my letters out to be copied so that I may\n\n                        11\n\f         At a hearing on August 18, 1988, Judge Falcone told Mr.\nDouglas that “the procedure has changed effective April of this\nyear. It’s not the Office of the Public Defender that makes the final\ndecision as to whether or not an individual qualifies for\nrepresentation. That decision is now left in the hands of the Court\n. . . .” Judge Falcone told Mr. Douglas that the most expeditious\nway for him to renew his request for representation would be to\napply directly to the court, rather than continue with the appeal of\nthe OPD’s non-indigency determination. Judge Falcone explained\nthat the procedure for obtaining counsel included the filing of\nforms and an interview by the probation department. Judge\nFalcone directed Probation Officer Frank Caporale to assist Mr.\nDouglas in completing the proper form 5A requesting the\nassignment of counsel. Mr. Douglas submitted an application for\nappointment of counsel with the court. Officer Caporale then\n“reported to the PD that defendant was ‘conditionally eligible for\npublic defender representation.’” Mr. Douglas did not pursue his\nattempts to appeal the OPD’s initial non-indigency determination\nany further.\n         On August 26, 1988, Anthony Casale, criminal case\nmanager for the Superior Court of New Jersey, Criminal Division,\nvisited Mr. Douglas and informed him that, based on the\ninformation in the OPD’s January 21, 1988 letter, Mr. Douglas was\nstill ineligible for representation by the OPD.\n       In a letter dated August 26, 1988 addressed to Judge\nFalcone, Mr. Douglas described his interview with Mr. Casale.\nMr. Douglas enclosed photographs of the property he owned and\nexplained that the property was uninhabitable. Mr. Douglas\ncomplained that Mr. Casale had determined that he was not an\nindigent based on the information contained in the January 21,\n1988 letter from the OPD terminating representation. On\nSeptember 20, 1988, Judge Falcone ordered Mr. Casale to proceed\nwith a new investigation of Mr. Douglas’s eligibility for the\nappointment of counsel.\n      On October 6, 1988, Judge Falcone received a letter from\nMr. Douglas which was dated September 19, 1988. Judge Falcone\n\n\n       have a copy for my files.\n\n\n                                 12\n\fsummoned Mr. Douglas to appear before him on October 12, 1988\nand inquired as to why Mr. Douglas did not mail the letter directly\nto him instead of sending it first to Sheila Tucker. This procedure\ncaused a two-week delay in receiving Mr. Douglas’s mail. Mr.\nDouglas explained that the copy machine at the jail was broken so\nhe had to mail the letter to Ms. Tucker so she could make a copy\nand then mail the letter to the judge. Judge Falcone observed that\nthis was causing lengthy delays in all of Mr. Douglas’s\ncorrespondence to him. Judge Falcone stated that the letter dated\nSeptember 19, 1988 brought “quite a bit of additional information\nto [his] attention that [he] was never aware of.” Specifically, Judge\nFalcone stated that he had been unaware of the considerable efforts\nMr. Douglas had made to obtain counsel on his own, including\ncontacting and meeting with several private attorneys in August\nand September of 1987, all of whom were unable for various\nreasons to represent him.\n       Mr. Casale attended the October 12, 1988 hearing. He\ninformed the court that he had visited Mr. Douglas’s house and\nconfirmed that it had been damaged by a fire in 1985 and was\nessentially gutted. Mr. Casale also confirmed that there were liens\nagainst the house for taxes and utility bills. He told the court that\nhe had contacted five private attorneys and asked if they would\nrepresent Mr. Douglas. Each declined to do so. Mr. Casale\nrecommended that Mr. Douglas be assigned a Public Defender.\nJudge Falcone found that Mr. Douglas was an indigent entitled to\nrepresentation by the OPD.\n      On November 2, 1988, DPD Winograd met with Judge\nFalcone in his chambers and informed him that ADPD Albert\nKapin and ADPD Joseph Krakora would represent Mr. Douglas.\nADPD Kapin and ADPD Krakora met with Mr. Douglas that same\nday.\n        A pretrial conference was held approximately five months\nlater on April 3, 1989. At the conference, all of Mr. Douglas’s\npretrial motions were scheduled to be heard on August 7, 1989, and\na trial date was set for September 18, 1989.\n        Carmeta Albarus, an OPD investigator, interviewed Mr.\nGaskins on July 6, 1989. At the time of Mr. Douglas’s arrest, Mr.\nGaskins was infirm, suffering from emphysema, asthma, and heart\nfailure. When Mr. Gaskins was interviewed by Ms. Albarus, he\n\n                                 13\n\fwas “hooked up” to an oxygen machine and had difficulty talking.\nMr. Gaskins told Ms. Albarus that he did “not see Mr. Douglas\nwith any weapons” at the time of his arrest. He expressed his\nwillingness to testify on Mr. Douglas’s behalf. Mr. Gaskins passed\naway sometime in September of 1989; the precise date does not\nappear in the record.\n       The court considered pretrial motions on September 6, 7, 12,\n19, 20 and 21, 1989 and October 11 and 17, 1989.4 At the close of\nargument on October 17, the court indicated that it would render its\nrulings on October 26, 1989.\n       On November 22, 1989, the OPD received a letter from\nMichael and Sheila Tucker, two defense witnesses, stating that the\nTuckers were moving to Australia. Sheila Tucker had testified at\nthe October 11, 1989 hearing on Mr. Douglas’s suppression\nmotion. On December 21, 1989, ADPD Kapin and ADPD Krakora\nwrote to Judge Falcone requesting that the court “set a schedule for\nthe remaining hearings on the pretrial motion and a date for the\njury selection,” so they could schedule bringing the Tuckers back\nfrom Australia to testify. Id. at 167. The court did not respond to\nthe request.\n       On February 22, 1990, while the pretrial motions were still\npending, defense counsel filed a “Notice of Motions to Set Trial\nDate and Reduce Bail.” The affidavit of counsel accompanying the\nmotion reads in its entirety:\n              1. We represent the defendant Robert\n              Douglas in this case.\n\n\n              2. This case has been pending since\n              defendant's arrest on August 8, 1987.\n              Defendant has been held in the Essex\n\n\n       4\n        The pretrial motions included a motion to suppress\nevidence received from Mr. Douglas at the time of his arrest,\nsuppression of evidence received from Mr. Douglas’s apartment\non August 8, 1987, motions relating to discovery issues and\nissues relative to aggravating factors, dismissal of the indictment\nand issues relative to identification.\n\n                                14\n\fCounty Jail since that time in lieu of\n$500,000 bail. As of February 19,\n1990, no dates have been set for the\nremaining pretrial hearings or for jury\nselection. By letter dated December\n21, 1989, we requested that dates be\nset, but no response to that letter has\nbeen received.\n\n\n3. In addition to the prejudice\nresulting from defendant’s continued\npretrial incarceration, we assert that\nthe ongoing delay in this case has\nprejudiced him in the following ways:\n\n\n       a)     Two defense witnesses -\n              Sheila and Mickey\n              Tucker - have moved to\n              Australia.\n\n\n       b)     One potential defense\n              witness Irving Gaskins -\n              died in September,\n              1989.\n\n\n       c)     Without knowing the\n              Court’s rulings on the\n              pretrial motions, we\n              have been unable to\n              finalize trial strategy.\n\n\n       d)     We are unable to give\n              our fact and character\n              witnesses any guidance\n              as to the timing of the\n              trial and we fear that it\n\n                  15\n\f                            will be increasingly\n                            difficult to enlist their\n                            cooperation.\n\n\n                    e)      There is a strong\n                            possibility that the trial\n                            will be further delayed\n                            in the event either side\n                            takes interlocutory\n                            appeals from the\n                            Court’s rulings on the\n                            pretrial motions.\n\n\n                    f)      Such a long delay between\n                            arrest and trial may create the\n                            impression to the jury that the\n                            defendant’s guilt is not really at\n                            issue -just the punishment to\n                            which he should be subjected.\n\n\n      4. We respectfully request that a trial date be set and\n      that defendant’s bail be reduced.\n       On March 9, 1990, Judge Falcone set a trial date of\nSeptember 10, 1990 and announced that since he had been\nappointed presiding judge of the Criminal Division, he had\nreassigned this matter to the Judge Alvin Weiss. On May 18, 1990,\nJudge Weiss ruled on the pretrial motions which had been pending\nsince October 17, 1989.\n      Jury selection began on September 10, 1990. The trial\ncommenced on October 30, 1990, some three years after Mr.\nDouglas was indicted and approximately two years after ADPD\nKapin and ADPD Krakora were appointed to represent him. On\nNovember 16, 1990, a jury convicted Mr. Douglas on all counts.\nThe jury did not vote to impose the death penalty. Mr. Douglas\nwas sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment. The\nAppellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the\n\n\n                                16\n\fconviction on June 23, 1995. The New Jersey Supreme Court\ndenied certification on October 11, 1995.\n                                   B\n        On December 2, 1997, Mr. Douglas filed a petition for post-\nconviction relief in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Essex\nCounty (“PCR Court”). He alleged that he was denied his right to\na speedy trial and to the appointment of counsel during a critical\nstage in the adversary proceedings. Mr. Douglas also complained\nof prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.\nMr. Douglas alleged that his counsel was ineffective because they\nfailed to move for dismissal due to the extended pretrial delay. The\nPCR Court granted relief to Mr. Douglas based upon his claim that\nhis Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had been violated. It\ndenied the remainder of his claims.\n         The PCR Court applied the four-part test enunciated in\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972) in determining that Mr.\nDouglas was denied a speedy trial. In Barker, the Supreme Court\nset forth the factors that must be balanced to evaluate a speedy trial\nclaim as follows: “Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the\ndefendant’s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.”\nId. at 530 (citing United States v. Simmons, 338 F.2d 804, 807 (2d\nCir. 1964). With respect to the length of delay, the PCR Court\nquoted Hakeem v. Beyer, 990 F.2d 750 (3d Cir. 1993) for the\nprinciple that a delay of 14 months, measured from the date of\narrest until the commencement of trial “is not dispositive in and of\nitself, but is sufficiently lengthy to warrant an inquiry into the other\nfacts.” Transcript of PCR Proceedings, September 25, 1998, at 91\n(quoting Hakeem, 990 F.2d at 760). The PCR Court concluded that\n“a delay of 30 months to the date they fix the trial [date] and 38\nmonths till you get to trial passes the test of presumptive prejudice\nand therefore requires an analysis of the other factors in the case.”\nId.\n         The PCR Court attributed the reason for delay to the state’s\nfailure to provide Mr. Douglas with counsel, holding that “[w]hen\nthe courts and/or the Public Defender’s Office drops the ball, that\nstill affects the defendant’s rights,” and “the investigation which\nshould have been undertaken promptly by the public defender was\nnot undertaken and a limited investigation was done.” Id. at 97.\nThe PCR Court noted that this was a capital case, requiring early\n\n                                  17\n\fpreparation of counsel, id. at 96, and emphasized the errors made\nby the trial court and the OPD. Id. at 96-98. The PCR Court\nconcluded that Mr. Douglas had asserted his rights, stating that it\nwas “abundantly clear that the defendant was constantly\ncomplaining that he wasn’t getting representation, that he wasn’t\nable to establish his innocence and wasn’t able to have his day in\ncourt.” Id. at 91-92. The PCR Court also found prejudice due to\nthe death of Mr. Gaskins. Id. at 99.\n       With respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,\nthe PCR court concluded, after an evidentiary hearing, that Mr.\nDouglas’s Sixth Amendment rights had not been violated. As the\nPCR Court expressed it, “I do not find that the defendant has\nestablished in any way, shape or form that . . . any errors which\nmay have been made by counsel were so serious that counsel was\nnot functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the 6th\namendment.” Id. at 56.\n\n\n       With respect to the charge that counsel had provided\nineffective assistance by failing to file a speedy trial motion, the\nPCR Court credited counsel’s testimony, finding as follows:\n                “[Counsel] didn’t file the motion to\n                dismiss for lack of a speedy trial\n                because that would have required him\n                to disclose trial strategy. And I think\n                more importantly, he couldn’t imagine\n                the motion being granted considering\n                the nature of the case.”\nId. at 57-58.\n       The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey\n(“Appellate Division”) reversed the PCR Court’s ruling that Mr.\nDouglas was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and\naffirmed its disposition of the remaining claims. As to the length\nof the delay, the Appellate Division held that “a three-year delay\ndoes not by itself give rise to prejudice or denial of the right to\nspeedy trial.” State v. Douglas, 322 N.J. Super. 156, 171 (1999)\n(citing State v. Long, 119 N.J. 439, 469, 575 A.2d 435 (1990)).\nRelying on a study conducted by a New Jersey Governor’s\nCommission, the Appellate Division observed “that capital cases\n\n                                  18\n\fin New Jersey are generally not tried for two years following\nindictment,” id., and determined that, because Mr. Douglas did not\nappear to be entitled to appointed counsel, the PCR Court put too\nmuch emphasis on the OPD’s withdrawal of representation, the\nsubsequent difficulties in challenging that decision, and the failure\nof the trial court to recognize that it was responsible for appointing\ncounsel as of April 3, 1988. Id. at 172-73.\n        The Appellate Division determined that the reason for the\ndelay was the appellate process. “[I]n no event can it be said that\nadvising defendant of his need to pursue an appeal and reliance by\nthe courts and PD on that requirement, as required by law at the\ntime of the PD’s decision, was a deliberate attempt to hamper the\ndefense.” Id. Regarding the third Barker factor, the Appellate\nDivision did not specifically discuss whether Mr. Douglas had\npreserved his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial before the\ntrial court.\n       The Appellate Division further held that Mr. Douglas failed\nto demonstrate prejudice because “Gaskins died months before the\n[February 22, 1990] motion was filed.” Id. at 174. “[A]ny\nprejudice concerning Gaskins’ death is merely speculative,” id.,\nand, in light of the weight of other evidence presented at trial,\nincluding the testimony of the surviving victim, “the testimony of\nall the officers that defendant had a loaded handgun in his\npossession at the time of his arrest in the Gaskins’ apartment, and\nthe discovery of the holster in defendant’s apartment,” Mr.\nGaskins’ testimony would not have impacted the verdict. Id. at\n174-75.\n       The New Jersey Supreme Court denied Mr. Douglas’s\npetition for certification.\n                                 II\nMr. Douglas filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 2254 on December 8, 1999.5 The District Court\n\n       5\n        The District Court accurately categorized Mr. Douglas’s\nclaims as:\n\n              (1) denial of speedy trial rights; (2)\n              erroneous reinstatement of\n\n                                 19\n\f held that Petitioner had not made a substantial showing of the\ndeprivation of a constitutional right as required under 28 U.S.C.\n § 2254 and denied the petition. Mr. Douglas has filed a timely\nappeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and\n                              2253.\n                               III\n                               A\n       Mr. Douglas contends that the District Court applied the\nwrong standard of review. We disagree. As the District Court\ncorrectly noted:\n             [F]ederal habeas corpus relief is\n             denied to any claim which was\n             adjudicated on the merits in a state\n             court proceeding, unless such\n             application (1) resulted in a decision\n             that was contrary to, or involved an\n             unreasonable application of, clearly\n             established Federal law, as determined\n             by the Supreme Court; or (2) resulted\n\n\n             indictment; (3) unconstitutional\n             search and seizure; (4)\n             unconstitutional arrest warrant; (5)\n             inadequate representation, including\n             denial of counsel, constructive denial\n             of counsel and ineffective assistance\n             of counsel; (6) denial of fair trial,\n             including prosecutorial misconduct,\n             erroneous admission of evidence,\n             erroneous jury instructions, failure to\n             declare mistrial and verdict against\n             the weight of the evidence; (7) denial\n             of a direct appeal; (8) erroneous\n             opinion by the Appellate Division;\n             (9) denial of a speedy appeal and\n             (10) deprivation of liberty. Douglas\n             v. Hendricks, 236 F. Supp. 2d 412\n             (D.N.J. 2002).\n\n                               20\n\f              in a decision that was based on an\n              unreasonable determination of the\n              facts in light of evidence presented in\n              the state court proceeding.\n\n\nDouglas, 236 F. Supp. 2d at 425 citing 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n       In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), the Supreme\nCourt explained that\n              [u]nder the “contrary to” clause, a\n              federal habeas court may grant the\n              writ if the state court arrives at a\n              conclusion opposite to that reached by\n              this Court on a question of law or if\n              the state court decides a case\n              differently than this Court has on a set\n              of materially indistinguishable facts.\n              Under the “unreasonable application”\n              clause, a federal habeas court may\n              grant the writ if the state court\n              identifies the correct governing legal\n              principle from this Court’s decisions\n              but unreasonably applies that principle\n              to the facts of the prisoner’s case.\nId. at 412-413. For the writ to issue, the state court’s application\nof federal law must be objectively unreasonable. Lockyer v.\nAndrade, 538 U.S. 63, 75-76 (2003).\n        The District Court correctly quoted the standard of review\nset forth in §§ 2254(d)(1) and (2). It also appropriately applied the\nSupreme Court and Third Circuit authorities that have interpreted\nthat standard. The District Court also accurately noted that “[t]he\nAEDPA increased the deference federal courts must give to factual\nfindings and legal determinations of the state courts.” Douglas,\n236 F. Supp. 2d at 421.\n       Mr. Douglas has correctly pointed out that the District Court\nin one place misquoted the standard of review under 28 U.S.C. §\n2254(d)(2) and that the misstatement was quite similar to one of\ntwo errors we identified in Johnson v. Carroll, 369 F.3d 253, 259\n\n                                 21\n\f(3d Cir. 2004). However, Mr. Douglas’s petition does not turn on\nthe § 2254(d)(2) standard since he is arguing that his detention is\nthe result of an unreasonable application of clearly established\nSupreme Court precedent to the facts under § 2254(d)(1). He\nmakes no claim to habeas relief based on any allegedly\nunreasonable determination of facts under § 2254(d)(2) and so this\nmisstatement is not relevant to the present appeal.\n\n\n                                 B\n       Mr. Douglas also contends that the District Court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that his Sixth Amendment Right to a\nspeedy trial was violated. The District Court’s legal conclusions\nregarding Mr. Douglas’s speedy trial claim are reviewed de novo.\nBurkett v. Fulcomer, 951 F.2d 1431, 1437 (3d Cir. 1991) (citing\nLesko v. Owens, 881 F.2d 44 (3d Cir. 1989).\n        The District Court correctly concluded that it “will not\nconsider how it would have applied the Barker test because habeas\nrelief is only available where the state court’s application is\n‘objectively unreasonable.’” Douglas, 236 F.Supp. 2d at 425\n(quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 409). The District Court stated that\nis was “constrained to deny Petitioner relief on this ground because\nthe Appellate Division’s decision did not involve an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established federal law . . . .” Id.\nAccordingly, the District Court held that the strict standard set\nforth in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) compelled the denial of Mr.\nDouglas’s habeas corpus petition. This Court is bound by that\nsame strict standard.\n       As evidenced by the decision of the Appellate Division,\nreasonable jurists may disagree as to the correct disposition of Mr.\nDouglas’s speedy trial claim. However, because the decision by\nthe Appellate Division was not objectively unreasonable, we must\naffirm. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 411 (“Under § 2254(d)(1)’s\n‘unreasonable application’ clause, then, a federal habeas court may\nnot issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its\nindependent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied\nclearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather,\nthat application must also be unreasonable.”).\n\n\n\n                                22\n\f        The Appellate Division recognized that the three year period\nfrom Mr. Douglas’s arrest to the commencement of trial was of\nsufficient length that it was required to make a full inquiry into and\nto balance each of the Barker factors to determine whether he was\ndenied his right to a speedy trial. The record shows that ADPD\nDouglas was appointed to represent Mr. Douglas on August 12,\n1987, three days after his arrest. The OPD withdrew from\nrepresenting Mr. Douglas on January 21, 1988 because it had\nconcluded that Mr. Douglas was ineligible for appointed counsel.\nDuring that period of representation, ADPD Douglas met with his\nclient, prepared a witness list, and authorized the interrogation of\npotential defense witnesses. Mr. Douglas was not represented by\ncounsel for nine months and twelve days because of the procedural\nconfusion caused by the change in the statute transferring the\ndetermination of indigency from the OPD to the trial court.\n        ADPD Kapin testified during the PCR Court proceedings\nthat in his experience, it is not uncommon to spend two to three\nyears preparing for the trial of a capital case. Mr. Douglas’s case\ncame to trial three years after he was charged.\n        With respect to the length of the delay, the Appellate\nDivision noted that three years was not an extraordinary pretrial\nperiod for a capital case, citing data indicating that such cases\ncommonly take at least two years to get to trial. The court\nexplained that this was in part due to the fact that counsel were\nrequired to prepare during that period not only a defense to a very\nserious charge but also the defendant’s mitigating factor position\nfor the penalty phase.\n        In Barker, the prosecution sought and obtained a series of\nsixteen continuances to facilitate the prosecution of Silas Manning,\nWillie Barker’s cohort. 407 U.S. at 516-17. The prosecutors in\nBarker believed they needed to first obtain Mr. Manning’s\nconviction in order to avoid the assertion by Mr. Manning of his\nprivilege against self-incrimination and assure his testimony\nagainst Mr. Barker. Id. at 516. Here, by contrast, the two principal\nreasons for the delay were the good faith albeit erroneous\nconclusion by the OPD that Mr. Douglas was not an indigent and\nthe failure of the trial judge to inform Mr. Douglas until August 18,\n1988 that, due to a change in the law in April, indigency\ndeterminations were no longer the responsibility of the OPD.\n\n                                 23\n\fWhile the “ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest\nwith the government rather than with the defendant,” 407 U.S. at\n531, the record in this case shows that there was no deliberate\nattempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense. The trial\ncourt scheduled several hearings in order to learn about Mr.\nDouglas’s efforts to retain private counsel and the progress of his\nefforts to demonstrate that he was an indigent.\n        With regard to the reason for the three-year pretrial delay in\nthis case, the Appellate Division concluded that “[a]ll pretrial time\nwas productively used once defense counsel were assigned, and\nwhen they asked that a trial date be set, it was fixed in accordance\nwith a schedule satisfactory to the defense.” Douglas, 322 N.J.\nSuper. at 171. As to the proceeding period, the court found that\n“the judiciary’s failure to be more aggressive in reviewing\ndefendant’s claim of indigency” was not excusable. At the same\ntime, it concluded that “in no event [could] it be said that advising\ndefendant of his need to pursue an appeal and the reliance of the\ncourt and the PD on that requirement . . . was a deliberate attempt\nto hamper the defense.” Id. at 171-72.\n        “A defendant who fails to demand a speedy trial [does not]\nforever [waive] his right.” 407 U.S. at 528. However, “failure to\nassert the right will make it difficult for [petitioner] to prove that he\nwas denied a speedy trial.” Id. at 532. A pro se criminal defendant\ndoes not have to make a procedurally perfect assertion of his\nspeedy trial rights, but must make a “reasonable assertion” of the\nright so as to put authorities on notice of his Sixth Amendment\nclaim. Gov’t of the Virgin Is. v. Pemberton, 813 F.2d 626, 629 (3d\nCir. 1987).\n       Whether or not the February 22, 1990 motion can be\nconstrued as one for a speedy trial,6 it is clear from the record that\n\n       6\n        When ADPD Kapin was asked at Mr. Douglas’s PCR\nhearing whether the February 22, 1990 motion was a “speedy\ntrial” motion, he stated that “whether it’s called a speedy-trial\nmotion, I believe the effect was basically the same, we wanted a\nspeedy trial date . . . .” He also testified, however, that Mr.\nDouglas would have been prejudiced by an unsuccessful motion\nto dismiss on speedy trial grounds because it would have\nrevealed his trial strategy.\n\n                                   24\n\fMr. Douglas made a “reasonable assertion” of his Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. As Mr. Douglas points out in\nthis appeal, his well-documented efforts to secure counsel are\nproperly viewed as part and parcel of his efforts to assert his Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. Mr. Douglas’s continuous\nrequests for counsel were founded, in large part, on his concern\nthat he be given an opportunity to prove his innocence before\nevidence was lost. For example, in his correspondence of May 16,\n1988 with Public Defender Slocum, Mr. Douglas expressed\nconcern over the delay in his case:\n               During the five months I was being\n               represented by the Office of the Public\n               Defender, Essex Region, to my\n               knowledge, only four statements were\n               obtained. Three individuals, Mr.\n               Donald Well [address omitted]; Mr.\n               Calvin Bonds [address omitted]; and\n               Mr. Gene Sutton, address unknown,\n               came to the Office of the Public\n               Defender to make statements, but no\n               statements were taken from these\n               persons.\n\n\n               To prove my innocence, it is\n               imperative that I have a fair trial with\n               proper representation and competent\n               defense presentation.\n\n\nIn his July 25, 1988 letter to Judge Falcone, Mr. Douglas wrote:\n“Conducting an investigation, locating witnesses and relying on\nmemories after a year may be tenuous at best. Day by day the\nchances that I may be able to prove my innocence may, perhaps,\nbecome more and more remote.” Mr. Douglas’s assertion of his\nright to a speedy trial alone, however, is not sufficient to undermine\nthe overall reasonableness of the Appellate Division’s Barker\nanalysis. See Barker, 407 U.S. at 533 (“none of the four factors\nidentified . . . [is] either a necessary or sufficient condition to the\nfinding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial”).\n\n                                  25\n\f        Finally, on the question of prejudice, the Barker Court held\nthat “[i]f witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is\nobvious.” Barker, 407 U.S. at 532. The Barker Court also\ninstructed, however, that\n              [w]e regard none of the four factors\n              identified above as either a necessary\n              or sufficient condition to the finding\n              of a deprivation of the right of speedy\n              trial. Rather, they are related factors\n              and must be considered together with\n              such other circumstances as may be\n              relevant. In sum, these factors have\n              no talismanic qualities; courts must\n              still engage in a difficult and sensitive\n              balancing process.\n\n\nId. at 533.\n       The Appellate Division concluded that there is\n              nothing in the record to suggest that\n              defendant was unduly prejudiced by\n              the delay which can be attributable to\n              the assignment of counsel at the outset\n              of capital proceedings.            Such\n              proceedings would have, of necessity\n              by virtue of the needs of the defense\n              team in a capital case, carried beyond\n              the death of Irving Gaskins or any\n              other event which defendant points to\n              as the basis for his claim of prejudice.\n\n\nDouglas, 322 N.J. Super. at 173.\n        Mr. Gaskins died in September 1989, approximately twenty-\nfive months after Mr. Douglas’s arrest. The record shows that the\ndefense team’s need to prepare for trial and a a possible penalty\nphase in a capital case would have continued beyond the date of\nMr. Gaskins’s death. ADPD Kapin testified that in his experience,\n“it is not uncommon to spend two to three years in preparing for\n\n                                 26\n\ftrial.” Here, the record shows that the defense team was not\nprepared to request a trial date until five months after Mr. Gaskins\ndied. Furthermore, as noted by the Appellate Division\n              any prejudice concerning Gaskins’\n              death is merely speculative. . . . [T]he\n              nature of Gaskins’ statement regarding\n              what he did not see without a fuller\n              explanation of what he did observe . .\n              . does not warrant the granting of post-\n              conviction relief on the grounds that\n              defendant was prejudiced by virtue of\n              the pretrial delay.\n\n\nDouglas, 322 N.J. Super. at 175. We conclude that the Appellate\nDivision’s balancing of the Barker factors was not objectively\nunreasonable.\n                                  C\n        Mr. Douglas argues that habeas corpus relief should be\ngranted because he was denied counsel at a critical stage during the\nprosecutorial process. “[A] constitutional violation is per se\nprejudicial only if the error occurs during a ‘critical stage’ of the\nprosecutorial process.” Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 695-96 (2002)\n(holding that “[a] trial would be presumptively unfair . . . where the\naccused is denied the presence of counsel at ‘a critical stage’”).\n“The [Supreme] Court has identified as ‘critical stages’ those\npretrial procedures that would impair defense on the merits if the\naccused is required to proceed without counsel.” Gerstein v. Pugh,\n420 U.S. 103, 122 (1975); see also Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S.\n1, 9 (1970); United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 226-27 (1967).\nMr. Douglas was afforded counsel at trial and at every hearing\nwhere the merits of his case were argued. Mr. Douglas has failed\nto demonstrate that he was denied counsel at a critical stage in the\nproceedings.\n                                  D\n      Mr. Douglas alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the\nground that his trial counsel failed to move for dismissal due to the\nextended pretrial delay. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\n                                 27\n\fare evaluated pursuant to the standard enunciated in Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). It has two components. “First,\nthe defendant must show that counsel’s performance was\ndeficient.” Id. at 687. When a convicted defendant complains of\nineffective counsel, the defendant must show that counsel’s\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\nId. at 687-88. “Second, the defendant must show that the deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defense.” Id. at 687. And Mr. Douglas\nmust show there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\nunprofessional errors, if any, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different. Id. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id.\n         Judicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly\ndeferential because “it is all too tempting for a defendant to second-\nguess counsel’s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and\nit is all too easy for a court, . . . to conclude that a particular act or\nomission of counsel was unreasonable.” Id. at 689. “A fair\nassessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be\nmade to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight. . . .” Id.\n        The District Court correctly concluded that the PCR Court’s\ndecision, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division without\ncomment, was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of,\nthe two-part Strickland test. ADPD Kapin testified at the PCR\nCourt proceedings that he could not imagine that, given the nature\nof this case, a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with speedy\ntrial requirements would have been granted. He stated that he was\nmore concerned about getting the case set for a trial so it could be\nlitigated. He also stated that making a motion for a dismissal on\nspeedy trial grounds would have required disclosure of the defense\ntrial strategy and, in his opinion, would have been denied. We\nagree with the PCR Court that Mr. Douglas has failed to\ndemonstrate that his attorneys’ performance was defective.\n       We also agree with the PCR Court’s determination that Mr.\nDouglas has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his\ncounsels’ failure to move for a dismissal on speedy trial grounds\nbased on the death of Mr. Gaskins prior to the trial date. As the\nAppellate Division observed, “any prejudice concerning Gaskins’\ndeath is merely speculative.” State v. Douglas, 322 N.J. Super. at\n174 (addressing the fourth Barker factor in analyzing Mr.\n\n                                   28\n\fDouglas’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial). The Appellate\nDivision continued,\n                 given the identification of defendant\n                 by Ms. Broadway, the testimony of all\n                 th officers that defendant had a loaded\n                 handgun in his possession at the time\n                 of his arrest in the Gaskins apartment,\n                 and the discovery of the holster in\n                 defendant’s apartment, all as detailed\n                 in our opinion on direct appeal, we\n                 conclude that Gaskins’ death (coming\n                 as it did after the Public Defender’s\n                 interview without an endeavor to\n                 preserve his testimony, the nature of\n                 Gaskins’ statement regarding what he\n                 did observe, and the giving of that\n                 statement long before a motion was\n                 made to fix a trial date) does not\n                 warrant the granting of post-\n                 conviction relief on the grounds that\n                 defendant was prejudiced by virtue of\n                 the pretrial delay.\nId. at 174-75.\n       We agree with the Appellate Division’s reasoning with\nrespect to Barker’s fourth “prejudice” factor.7 Mr. Douglas has\n\n       7\n        Judge Stapleton agrees that Mr. Douglas has not satisfied\nStrickland’s second prong because a motion to dismiss on\nspeedy trial grounds would have been unsuccessful. To the\nextent our conclusion on this issue or our conclusion regarding\nprejudice under Barker, rests on the assertion that Gaskins’s\ntestimony would not have been helpful to Mr. Douglas, Judge\nStapleton disagrees. In his view, even if Gaskins’s testimony\nhad been regarded as helpful to the defense, a speedy trial\nmotion would have been properly denied because, as the\nAppellate Division also concluded, there was no causal nexus\nbetween the unexcused nine month delay and the loss of\nGaskins’s testimony; that loss would have occurred even if there\nhad been no such delay.\n\n                                   29\n\ffailed to demonstrate that the Appellate Division’s conclusion, (1)\nthat his counsel were not ineffective in failing to move for a\ndismissal, and (2) that he was not denied a speedy trial due to the\nfact that Mr. Gaskins died before trial, was objectively\nunreasonable. Accordingly, the decision of the District Court will\nbe AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                30\n\f",

Douglas appeals from the order denying his pro\nse petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n2254. Mr. Douglas contends that the District Court failed to apply\nthe correct standard of review pursuant to the terms of the Anti-\nTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”). He also\nargues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because (1)\nhe was denied a speedy trial, (2) his counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to pursue his right to a speedy trial, and (3) he was\neffectively denied his right to counsel because he was\nunrepresented at a critical stage of the proceedings while he was in\ncustody on capital charges. We will affirm because we conclude\nthat the District Court applied the correct standard of review in\ndetermining that the Appellate Division’s decision was not\n“contrary to, [or did not involve] an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n                                 I\n       On August 7, 1987, Estella and Charlene Moore lived\ntogether with Charlene’s infant daughter in Apartment 2E in a\n\n                                 2\n\fbuilding in East Orange, New Jersey. Mr. Douglas, whose\nnickname is “Skeet” lived next door to the Moore sisters in\nApartment 2D. Georgianna Broadway and Deborah Neal lived\ntogether nearby in Newark, New Jersey. Ms. Broadway and Ms.\nNeal were friends of the Moore sisters. Ms. Broadway was\nintroduced to Mr. Douglas through the Moore sisters.\n        In late July or early August of 1987, Ms. Broadway had\nlunch with the Moore sisters at their apartment. She stayed about\nforty-five minutes. Mr. Douglas was also in Apartment 2E at the\nsame time. After repairing the front door of Apartment 2E, Mr.\nDouglas and the Moore sisters sat in the living room area\nconversing and consuming mixed drinks. Ms. Broadway sat\napproximately twenty feet away in the kitchen area listening to Mr.\nDouglas’s conversation with the Moore sisters as she ate her lunch.\n        On the evening of August 7, 1987, Ms. Broadway visited\nthe Moore sisters in Apartment 2E. At approximately 5:30 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 1987, Charlene Moore and Ms. Broadway went to sleep\nin the bedroom. Mervin Matthews, a friend of the Moore sisters,\narrived at their apartment building at around 6:00 a.m. to drop off\nEstella Moore’s keys and cigarettes. As he approached the\nbuilding, Mr. Matthews saw Mr. Douglas standing outside the\nentrance talking to another gentleman. Mr. Matthews greeted Mr.\nDouglas. The two men went upstairs together; Mr. Matthews\nentered the Moores’ apartment, while Mr. Douglas entered his own\napartment. About fifteen minutes later, when Mr. Matthews left\nthe Moores’ apartment, Mr. Douglas also exited his apartment and\njoined Mr. Matthews as he walked down the stairs. When Mr.\nMatthews left that morning, Mr. Douglas was standing outside the\napartment building.\n        Kenneth Hampton, an acquaintance of Mr. Douglas’s who\nneeded a place to stay, spent the night of August 7, 1987 at Mr.\nDouglas’s apartment. At around 6:45 a.m. or 7:00 a.m., Mr.\nHampton left the apartment to go outside and catch a ride to work.\nHe saw Mr. Douglas sitting alone on the front stoop of the\napartment building. The two men spoke briefly and Mr. Hampton\nran to the corner to catch his ride.\n       Ms. Broadway awakened some time around 7:00 a.m. or\n7:30 a.m. and heard Estella Moore speaking to Mr. Douglas in the\nkitchen area. Ms. Broadway asked Charlene Moore to bring her\n\n                                3\n\fMs. Broadway’s pocketbook and keys from the kitchen. Charlene\nMoore complied. Ms. Broadway asked Estella Moore to prepare\na meal for her. Estella Moore brought Ms. Broadway a tray of\nChinese food. Ms. Broadway noticed that Estella Moore had “a\nvery scared look on her face” when she entered the bedroom. Ms.\nBroadway asked Estella Moore “what was wrong.” Estella replied,\n“Nothing. Nothing.”\n       A few minutes later, the bedroom door was pushed open and\nsix shots were fired in rapid succession. Ms. Broadway did not see\nthe perpetrator. She received bullet wounds under her chin and on\nher right arm. She also was grazed by bullets on her chest and\nthumb. The Moore sisters died instantly from close range bullet\nwounds. After determining that the sisters were dead, Ms.\nBroadway saw the baby’s foot move. The baby was unharmed.\nMs. Broadway placed the baby inside her coat.\n       Ms. Broadway waited for up to thirty minutes to leave the\napartment building because she was unsure of the perpetrator’s\nwhereabouts. She drove herself to her residence. When she\nentered the apartment, she told Ms. Neal: “Skeet just shot all three\nof us and Stella and Charlene is [sic] dead.” Ms. Neal telephoned\nthe East Orange Police Department to report the homicides. She\nindicated that “Skeet,” the occupant of Apartment 2D, was a\npossible suspect.\n       Officer Alfred Rizzolo arrived at Ms. Broadway’s residence\nat 9:35 a.m. on August 8, 1987. Ms. Broadway was being treated\nby emergency medical service personnel. She appeared to be\nnervous, excited, and in a lot of pain. Ms. Broadway told Officer\nRizzolo that “Skeet” had shot her while she was at Apartment 2E\nand that “there were two dead bodies in that apartment.”\n       Sergeant Michael Brown, Officer Ronald Tisdale, and\nOfficer Ben Powell of the East Orange Police Department\nresponded to the dispatcher’s call about a double homicide in\nApartment 2E. Sergeant Brown was also informed that the\nperpetrator might be in Apartment 2D. Finding the door of\nApartment 2E ajar, the officers entered and discovered Estella and\nCharlene Moore lying on the bedroom floor. Each of them had\nmultiple gunshot wounds. The officers did not find any other\nperson or weapons in the bedroom. They recovered a round of\nammunition under a radiator in the bedroom.\n\n                                 4\n\f       The officers discovered the door of Apartment 2D ajar.\nThey entered in order to perform a plain-view search for weapons\nand/or persons. Captain John Armeno of the East Orange Police\nDepartment arrived at Apartment 2D at 10:00 a.m. He conducted\na search for weapons or “any other thing of evidentiary value.” He\nbelieved it was important to identify the perpetrator quickly.\nCaptain Armeno removed a photograph of a man from Apartment\n2D. The building’s manager identified the man in the photograph\nas Mr. Douglas.\n       Sergeant Ronald Sepe of the East Orange Police Department\ntook the photograph to the University Hospital where Ms.\nBroadway was being treated for her gunshot wounds. Sergeant\nSepe showed the photograph to Ms. Broadway and asked her if the\nman in photograph was the person who shot her. Ms. Broadway\nnodded her head and told Sergeant Sepe: “Yes.”\n       Warrants for the arrest of Mr. Douglas and the search of his\napartment were executed later that day. The search of Mr.\nDouglas’s apartment yielded “[a]n Ohaus tripple beam scale, a\nDerring gram scale, one hand held scale, glass bowl pipe, single\nedge razor, one spoon with residue, another spoon with residue,\none bag of suspect marijuana, one bag of suspect marijuana seed,\none pack of suspect cocaine, one black leather holster, two black\nleather cestus and one beige Rolodex file.” The Rolodex included\nthe name Irving Gaskins.\n        The next day, on August 9, 1987, eleven police officers\nwent to Mr. Gaskins’s apartment in Newark, New Jersey to locate\nMr. Douglas. Sergeant Sepe, Sergeant Alan Sierchio and four\nother police officers from the East Orange Police Department, were\nassisted by Sergeant Charles Whitner of the Newark, New Jersey\nPolice Department Tactical Unit; Officer Wayne Dooley, Officer\nGeorge Davey and Officer Thomas Hughes, also of the Newark\nPolice Department. Sergeants Sepe, Sierchio and Whitner, along\nwith Officers Hughes, Dooley and Davey, walked up to the third\nfloor apartment. Sergeant Whitner knocked on the door. They\nwere admitted by Bonita Allen who indicated that Mr. Douglas was\nin the living room.\n      Upon entering the apartment, the officers observed Mr.\nDouglas sitting on the couch in the living room. Sergeant Sepe,\nSergeant Whitner, Sergeant Sierchio, and Officer Dooley\n\n                                5\n\fapproached Mr. Douglas in the living room. Mr. Douglas stood up\nas the officers approached him. Mr. Gaskins was seated in the\nliving room on a chair near the couch. Sergeant Sepe placed Mr.\nDouglas under arrest. Sergeant Whitner handcuffed Mr. Douglas\nfrom behind while Sergeant Sepe, who was face-to-face with Mr.\nDouglas, performed a protective search. When searching Mr.\nDouglas, Sergeant Sepe came across a hard object and announced\nthat he had found a gun. Sergeant Sierchio moved in closer and\nobserved Sergeant Sepe lift Mr. Douglas’s shirt and seize a fully\nloaded six shot Spesco Taurus .38 caliber revolver from “the front\nportion of his pants in the waistband area.” The six rounds in the\nweapon were hollow-point bullets. Sergeant Whitner, Officer\nHughes, and Officer Davey also observed Sergeant Sepe remove\nthe weapon from Mr. Douglas’s waistband area. Sergeant Sierchio\nobserved Sergeant Sepe remove an additional five rounds of\nammunition, also hollow-point bullets, from Mr. Douglas’s right\nfront pocket. Prior to patting him down, Sergeant Sepe did not see\nthe weapon or a bulge in Mr. Douglas’s pants. The weapon was\nentirely concealed from view because Mr. Douglas’s shirt was\nhanging down over his waistband.\n        The gun holster located in Apartment 2D bore unique\nstriation marks matching those found on the weapon recovered\nfrom Mr. Douglas at the time of his arrest. Captain Carl Leisinger,\na ballistics expert, testified that the bullets recovered from the\nbodies of the Moore sisters and the spent round recovered in\nApartment 2E were fired from the revolver carried by Mr. Douglas\nat the time of his arrest. Captain Leisinger also testified that the\nrevolver seized from Mr. Douglas had unique striation marks cut\ninto the flutes of the outside cylinder. This is the only revolver\nCaptain Leisinger had seen, in examining tens of thousands of\nrevolvers, that had this particular type of fluting. These unique\nstriation marks were plainly imprinted on the black leather holster\nfound in Mr. Douglas’s apartment.\n                                 A\n       Ollie Douglas, an Assistant Deputy Public Defender\n(“ADPD”) with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender for\nEssex County (“OPD”), was appointed to represent Mr. Douglas on\nAugust 12, 1987, three days after he was arrested. At the time of\nhis appointment to represent Mr. Douglas, ADPD Douglas had\n\n                                 6\n\fserved as an Assistant Deputy Public Defender for fourteen years.\nHe had tried two or three capital cases. After interviewing Mr.\nDouglas, ADPA Douglas requested that a field investigation be\nconducted, rather than telephone contacts, with several individuals\nwhom Mr. Douglas disclosed might be witnesses to support his\ndefense. The list of prospective witnesses that Mr. Douglas\nsuggested should be questioned in person included Mr. Gaskins,\nSheila Tucker, and Michael Tucker.\n        On October 14, 1987, Mr. Douglas was charged with two\ncounts of murder, aggravated assault, possession of a handgun\nwithout a permit, and possession of a firearm for an unlawful\npurpose in violation of New Jersey law. ADPD Douglas\nrepresented Mr. Douglas at his arraignment on November 18, 1987.\nMr. Douglas entered a not guilty plea. Pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 3:7-\n3(c), the State served a notice of aggravating factors which, if\nproven at the penalty phase, would make Mr. Douglas eligible for\nthe death penalty. Deputy Public Defender (“DPD”) Mayer\nWinograd, the head of the Essex County OPD, was also assigned\nto represent Mr. Douglas. ADPD Douglas and DPD Winograd met\nwith Mr. Douglas several times while he was in jail.\n       On January 21, 1988, DPD Winograd informed Mr. Douglas\nthat the OPD had conducted a financial investigation and\ndetermined that he was ineligible for legal representation by the\nOPD.1 In its investigation, the OPD discovered that Mr. Douglas\nowned a house with a market value of $70,000 to $110,000,\ndepending on its condition. Similar houses in the immediate area\nhad recently sold for $90,000 and $125,000. DPD Winograd\nadvised Mr. Douglas that he had “a right to Appeal to the Appellate\nDivision which has exclusive jurisdiction” over the determination\nthat he was not entitled to the appointment of counsel based on\nindigency. In his letter to Mr. Douglas, DPD Winograd cited State\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        The OPD’s representation was terminated pursuant to\nN.J. Stat. Ann. § 2A:158A-15.1. At that time, §2A:158A-15.1\nprovided that the OPD was responsible for determining whether\nan accused was entitled to appointed counsel because of\nindigency.\n\n                                7\n\fv.

Judge Falcone informed Mr. Douglas of\nhis right to appeal the OPD’s decision to terminate his\nrepresentation.

Super.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986) in deciding whether to pursue\nhis claim that he was eligible for the appointment of counsel\nbecause he was indigent.\n       ADPD Douglas provided Mr. Douglas with the name and\naddress of James Smith, the deputy public defender “charged with\nhandling appeals in [the OPD’s] appellate section,” along with a\nnotice of appeal form to facilitate an appeal of the denial of\nrepresentation. In a letter dated February 8, 1988, Mr. Douglas\nwrote to DPD Smith declaring that he challenged the OPD’s\ndetermination that he was not eligible for representation.\n        During his next court appearance on February 16, 1988, Mr.\nDouglas informed Judge Falcone that he had corresponded with\nDPD Smith but had received no reply. Judge Falcone again\ninformed him of his right to appeal from the decision denying his\neligibility for the appointment of counsel and scheduled the next\nappearance on March 21, 1988. He also advised Mr. Douglas that\n\n\n       2\n        Nilsen holds that “the Public Defender was vested with\nthe authority to determine the eligibility of applicants for\nservice.” Nilsen, 214 N.J. Super. at 25 (citing N.J. Stat. Ann. §\n2A:158A-1.) In Nilsen, the court explained that the New Jersey\nlegislature “vest[ed] in the Public Defender the exclusive\nauthority to determine whether a defendant who has been\nindicted is indigent and eligible for representation by the Office\nof the Public Defender.” Id. at 26. The Nilsen court also\nexplained that “[i]f [a] rejected applicant wishes to contest the\nrejection, he or she should file an appeal with the Appellate\nDivision [of the Superior Court] pursuant to R. 2:2-3(a)(2).” Id.\nat 27 (citing N.J. Ct. R. 2:2-3).\n\n                                 8\n\fhe should inform the court in writing of any developments in his\nappeal from the refusal of the OPD to represent him.\n      When the matter came before the court on March 21, 1988,\nand again on April 19, 1988, Mr. Douglas appeared without\ncounsel. At the April 19, 1988 hearing, Judge Falcone provided\nMr. Douglas with a copy of the Nilsen opinion which set forth the\nproper procedure for appealing the OPD’s non-indigency\ndetermination.\n       On May 16, 1988, Mr. Douglas wrote to New Jersey Public\nDefender Alfred A. Slocum, seeking review of the OPD’s non-\nindigency determination. He explained to Mr. Slocum that Judge\nFalcone had informed him at the April 19, 1988 hearing that DPD\nSmith was not authorized to represent him in an appeal from the\ndecision of the OPD that he was not an indigent entitled to\nappointed counsel. He further stated that his inability to receive\nenvelopes and stamps at the county jail, or use their photocopying\nequipment, had prevented him from contacting Mr. Slocum until\nthe date of the letter.\n        At a subsequent court appearance on June 14, 1988, Judge\nFalcone informed Mr. Douglas that he should submit his appeal of\nthe denial of appointed counsel to the Appellate Division of the\nSuperior Court. That same day, Mr. Douglas wrote to Elizabeth\nMcLaughlin of the Clerk’s Office of the Superior Court of New\nJersey, Appellate Division, seeking review of the determination\nthat he was not an indigent. He stated in his letter that the property\nhe owned was worth very little because it had been damaged by\nfire and was in need of extensive repairs. Mr. Douglas also\ninformed Ms. McLaughlin that the cost of repairs would be\n$20,000, and that there was a mortgage on the property in the\namount of $8,379.60, as well as water and sewage liens in the\namount of $565.62 plus interest.\n       Section 2A:158A-15.1 was amended, effective on April 3,\n1988. As amended, it transferred the determination regarding\nwhether a defendant is indigent from the OPD to the court. Mr.\nDouglas was informed of this fact by Public Defender Slocum in\na letter dated June 20, 1988. Referring to the then recent\namendment to N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-2, Mr. Slocum wrote that:\n\n\n\n                                  9\n\f                 Effective April 5, 1988 by virtue of\n                 newly enacted legislation, the Office\n                 of the Public Defender was relieved of\n                 the responsibility of determining\n                 indigency. This determination is now\n                 made by the judiciary. Even if you\n                 were to successfully appeal Mr.\n                 Winograd’s determination, the Office\n                 of the Public Defender would not be\n                 able to decide whether you are\n                 indigent or not.\n\n\n                 You should immediately write to the\n                 Essex County Criminal Case Manager\n                 requesting that they provide you with\n                 an application for representation by\n                 the Office of the Public Defender. If\n                 they determine that you are eligible\n                 for our services, we will again\n                 undertake your representation.\n\n\n        On July 11, 1988, Jack Trubenbach, Clerk of the Superior\nCourt of New Jersey, Appellate Division, wrote to Mr. Douglas\ninforming him that his appeal of the denial of court appointed\ncounsel was rejected for failure to attach the appropriate\ndocuments. On July 25, 1988, Mr. Douglas wrote to Judge Falcone\nto inform the court of his lack of progress in obtaining counsel. He\ncomplained that he was misled by ADPD Douglas as to what was\nrequired for a successful appeal, and expressed general concern\nover the progress of his case. He also explained the difficulties he\nhad experienced obtaining access to the library, to a copy machine,\nand other resources necessary for his appeal of the OPD’s denial of\nrepresentation, due to his incarceration and placement in protective\ncustody.3\n\n\n        3\n            Mr. Douglas’s July 25, 1988 letter stated, in relevant\npart:\n\n\n                                  10\n\f        The information forwarded to me by Mr.\nTrubenbach makes me painfully aware of the\nmisleading and erroneous “advise” given to me by\nmy former Public Defender, Mr. Ollie Douglas,\nEsquire, vis a vis the nature and amount of\ninformation required concerning the appellate\nprocedures. I am shocked than an attorney with\nthe experience and expertise of Mr. Ollie Douglas\nwould inform me that a letter would be sufficient,\nas if that is all that is required, in such a\ncomplicated matter as the appellate process.\n\nI am very concerned about these proceedings and I\nhave to wonder as to the intention and/or motive\nconsidering that type and quality of representation\nafforded me during the time I was being\nrepresented by the Office of the Public Defender . .\n..\n\nAlso, I am curious that had I not mistakenly mailed\nthe letter that I sent to Mr. Slocum, would I have\nbeen informed of the change in the legislation\nsince the change occurred April 5, 1988 . . . .\n\nAs I had stated in previous correspondence, I am in\nAdministrative Segregation Protective Custody in\nthe Essex County Jail wherein I am allowed out of\nmy cell one hour during the day and one hour in\nthe evening. From June 23, 1988 through July 22,\n1988, the telephone was removed from the tier.\nFor two weeks prior to that the telephone was out\nof order. Also, as stated previously, access to the\nLaw Library is limited to one day a week for one\nhour. Often library is cancelled, so we have had\naccess to the library on the average of once a\nmonth. They copying machine has been operable\nonly twice on the days I have been able to go to the\nlibrary since May, requiring my continuing to have\nto send my letters out to be copied so that I may\n\n                        11\n\f         At a hearing on August 18, 1988, Judge Falcone told Mr.\nDouglas that “the procedure has changed effective April of this\nyear. It’s not the Office of the Public Defender that makes the final\ndecision as to whether or not an individual qualifies for\nrepresentation. That decision is now left in the hands of the Court\n. . . .” Judge Falcone told Mr. Douglas that the most expeditious\nway for him to renew his request for representation would be to\napply directly to the court, rather than continue with the appeal of\nthe OPD’s non-indigency determination. Judge Falcone explained\nthat the procedure for obtaining counsel included the filing of\nforms and an interview by the probation department. Judge\nFalcone directed Probation Officer Frank Caporale to assist Mr.\nDouglas in completing the proper form 5A requesting the\nassignment of counsel. Mr. Douglas submitted an application for\nappointment of counsel with the court. Officer Caporale then\n“reported to the PD that defendant was ‘conditionally eligible for\npublic defender representation.’” Mr. Douglas did not pursue his\nattempts to appeal the OPD’s initial non-indigency determination\nany further.\n         On August 26, 1988, Anthony Casale, criminal case\nmanager for the Superior Court of New Jersey, Criminal Division,\nvisited Mr. Douglas and informed him that, based on the\ninformation in the OPD’s January 21, 1988 letter, Mr. Douglas was\nstill ineligible for representation by the OPD.\n       In a letter dated August 26, 1988 addressed to Judge\nFalcone, Mr. Douglas described his interview with Mr. Casale.\nMr. Douglas enclosed photographs of the property he owned and\nexplained that the property was uninhabitable. Mr. Douglas\ncomplained that Mr. Casale had determined that he was not an\nindigent based on the information contained in the January 21,\n1988 letter from the OPD terminating representation. On\nSeptember 20, 1988, Judge Falcone ordered Mr. Casale to proceed\nwith a new investigation of Mr. Douglas’s eligibility for the\nappointment of counsel.\n      On October 6, 1988, Judge Falcone received a letter from\nMr. Douglas which was dated September 19, 1988. Judge Falcone\n\n\n       have a copy for my files.\n\n\n                                 12\n\fsummoned Mr. Douglas to appear before him on October 12, 1988\nand inquired as to why Mr. Douglas did not mail the letter directly\nto him instead of sending it first to Sheila Tucker. This procedure\ncaused a two-week delay in receiving Mr. Douglas’s mail. Mr.\nDouglas explained that the copy machine at the jail was broken so\nhe had to mail the letter to Ms. Tucker so she could make a copy\nand then mail the letter to the judge. Judge Falcone observed that\nthis was causing lengthy delays in all of Mr. Douglas’s\ncorrespondence to him. Judge Falcone stated that the letter dated\nSeptember 19, 1988 brought “quite a bit of additional information\nto [his] attention that [he] was never aware of.” Specifically, Judge\nFalcone stated that he had been unaware of the considerable efforts\nMr. Douglas had made to obtain counsel on his own, including\ncontacting and meeting with several private attorneys in August\nand September of 1987, all of whom were unable for various\nreasons to represent him.\n       Mr. Casale attended the October 12, 1988 hearing. He\ninformed the court that he had visited Mr. Douglas’s house and\nconfirmed that it had been damaged by a fire in 1985 and was\nessentially gutted. Mr. Casale also confirmed that there were liens\nagainst the house for taxes and utility bills. He told the court that\nhe had contacted five private attorneys and asked if they would\nrepresent Mr. Douglas. Each declined to do so. Mr. Casale\nrecommended that Mr. Douglas be assigned a Public Defender.\nJudge Falcone found that Mr. Douglas was an indigent entitled to\nrepresentation by the OPD.\n      On November 2, 1988, DPD Winograd met with Judge\nFalcone in his chambers and informed him that ADPD Albert\nKapin and ADPD Joseph Krakora would represent Mr. Douglas.\nADPD Kapin and ADPD Krakora met with Mr. Douglas that same\nday.\n        A pretrial conference was held approximately five months\nlater on April 3, 1989. At the conference, all of Mr. Douglas’s\npretrial motions were scheduled to be heard on August 7, 1989, and\na trial date was set for September 18, 1989.\n        Carmeta Albarus, an OPD investigator, interviewed Mr.\nGaskins on July 6, 1989. At the time of Mr. Douglas’s arrest, Mr.\nGaskins was infirm, suffering from emphysema, asthma, and heart\nfailure. When Mr. Gaskins was interviewed by Ms. Albarus, he\n\n                                 13\n\fwas “hooked up” to an oxygen machine and had difficulty talking.\nMr. Gaskins told Ms. Albarus that he did “not see Mr. Douglas\nwith any weapons” at the time of his arrest. He expressed his\nwillingness to testify on Mr. Douglas’s behalf. Mr. Gaskins passed\naway sometime in September of 1989; the precise date does not\nappear in the record.\n       The court considered pretrial motions on September 6, 7, 12,\n19, 20 and 21, 1989 and October 11 and 17, 1989.4 At the close of\nargument on October 17, the court indicated that it would render its\nrulings on October 26, 1989.\n       On November 22, 1989, the OPD received a letter from\nMichael and Sheila Tucker, two defense witnesses, stating that the\nTuckers were moving to Australia. Sheila Tucker had testified at\nthe October 11, 1989 hearing on Mr. Douglas’s suppression\nmotion. On December 21, 1989, ADPD Kapin and ADPD Krakora\nwrote to Judge Falcone requesting that the court “set a schedule for\nthe remaining hearings on the pretrial motion and a date for the\njury selection,” so they could schedule bringing the Tuckers back\nfrom Australia to testify. Id. at 167. The court did not respond to\nthe request.\n       On February 22, 1990, while the pretrial motions were still\npending, defense counsel filed a “Notice of Motions to Set Trial\nDate and Reduce Bail.” The affidavit of counsel accompanying the\nmotion reads in its entirety:\n              1. We represent the defendant Robert\n              Douglas in this case.\n\n\n              2. This case has been pending since\n              defendant's arrest on August 8, 1987.\n              Defendant has been held in the Essex\n\n\n       4\n        The pretrial motions included a motion to suppress\nevidence received from Mr. Douglas at the time of his arrest,\nsuppression of evidence received from Mr. Douglas’s apartment\non August 8, 1987, motions relating to discovery issues and\nissues relative to aggravating factors, dismissal of the indictment\nand issues relative to identification.\n\n                                14\n\fCounty Jail since that time in lieu of\n$500,000 bail. As of February 19,\n1990, no dates have been set for the\nremaining pretrial hearings or for jury\nselection. By letter dated December\n21, 1989, we requested that dates be\nset, but no response to that letter has\nbeen received.\n\n\n3. In addition to the prejudice\nresulting from defendant’s continued\npretrial incarceration, we assert that\nthe ongoing delay in this case has\nprejudiced him in the following ways:\n\n\n       a)     Two defense witnesses -\n              Sheila and Mickey\n              Tucker - have moved to\n              Australia.\n\n\n       b)     One potential defense\n              witness Irving Gaskins -\n              died in September,\n              1989.\n\n\n       c)     Without knowing the\n              Court’s rulings on the\n              pretrial motions, we\n              have been unable to\n              finalize trial strategy.\n\n\n       d)     We are unable to give\n              our fact and character\n              witnesses any guidance\n              as to the timing of the\n              trial and we fear that it\n\n                  15\n\f                            will be increasingly\n                            difficult to enlist their\n                            cooperation.\n\n\n                    e)      There is a strong\n                            possibility that the trial\n                            will be further delayed\n                            in the event either side\n                            takes interlocutory\n                            appeals from the\n                            Court’s rulings on the\n                            pretrial motions.\n\n\n                    f)      Such a long delay between\n                            arrest and trial may create the\n                            impression to the jury that the\n                            defendant’s guilt is not really at\n                            issue -just the punishment to\n                            which he should be subjected.\n\n\n      4. We respectfully request that a trial date be set and\n      that defendant’s bail be reduced.\n       On March 9, 1990, Judge Falcone set a trial date of\nSeptember 10, 1990 and announced that since he had been\nappointed presiding judge of the Criminal Division, he had\nreassigned this matter to the Judge Alvin Weiss. On May 18, 1990,\nJudge Weiss ruled on the pretrial motions which had been pending\nsince October 17, 1989.\n      Jury selection began on September 10, 1990. The trial\ncommenced on October 30, 1990, some three years after Mr.\nDouglas was indicted and approximately two years after ADPD\nKapin and ADPD Krakora were appointed to represent him. On\nNovember 16, 1990, a jury convicted Mr. Douglas on all counts.\nThe jury did not vote to impose the death penalty. Mr. Douglas\nwas sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment. The\nAppellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the\n\n\n                                16\n\fconviction on June 23, 1995. The New Jersey Supreme Court\ndenied certification on October 11, 1995.\n                                   B\n        On December 2, 1997, Mr. Douglas filed a petition for post-\nconviction relief in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Essex\nCounty (“PCR Court”). He alleged that he was denied his right to\na speedy trial and to the appointment of counsel during a critical\nstage in the adversary proceedings. Mr. Douglas also complained\nof prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.\nMr. Douglas alleged that his counsel was ineffective because they\nfailed to move for dismissal due to the extended pretrial delay. The\nPCR Court granted relief to Mr. Douglas based upon his claim that\nhis Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had been violated. It\ndenied the remainder of his claims.\n         The PCR Court applied the four-part test enunciated in\nBarker v. Wingo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972) in determining that Mr.\nDouglas was denied a speedy trial. In Barker, the Supreme Court\nset forth the factors that must be balanced to evaluate a speedy trial\nclaim as follows: “Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the\ndefendant’s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.”\nId. at 530 (citing United States v.

The PCR Court concluded that\n“a delay of 30 months to the date they fix the trial [date] and 38\nmonths till you get to trial passes the test of presumptive prejudice\nand therefore requires an analysis of the other factors in the case.”\nId.\n         The PCR Court attributed the reason for delay to the state’s\nfailure to provide Mr. Douglas with counsel, holding that “[w]hen\nthe courts and/or the Public Defender’s Office drops the ball, that\nstill affects the defendant’s rights,” and “the investigation which\nshould have been undertaken promptly by the public defender was\nnot undertaken and a limited investigation was done.” Id. at 97.\nThe PCR Court noted that this was a capital case, requiring early\n\n                                  17\n\fpreparation of counsel, id. at 96, and emphasized the errors made\nby the trial court and the OPD. Id. at 96-98. The PCR Court\nconcluded that Mr. Douglas had asserted his rights, stating that it\nwas “abundantly clear that the defendant was constantly\ncomplaining that he wasn’t getting representation, that he wasn’t\nable to establish his innocence and wasn’t able to have his day in\ncourt.” Id. at 91-92. The PCR Court also found prejudice due to\nthe death of Mr. Gaskins. Id. at 99.\n       With respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,\nthe PCR court concluded, after an evidentiary hearing, that Mr.\nDouglas’s Sixth Amendment rights had not been violated. As the\nPCR Court expressed it, “I do not find that the defendant has\nestablished in any way, shape or form that . . . any errors which\nmay have been made by counsel were so serious that counsel was\nnot functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the 6th\namendment.” Id. at 56.\n\n\n       With respect to the charge that counsel had provided\nineffective assistance by failing to file a speedy trial motion, the\nPCR Court credited counsel’s testimony, finding as follows:\n                “[Counsel] didn’t file the motion to\n                dismiss for lack of a speedy trial\n                because that would have required him\n                to disclose trial strategy. And I think\n                more importantly, he couldn’t imagine\n                the motion being granted considering\n                the nature of the case.”\nId. at 57-58.\n       The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey\n(“Appellate Division”) reversed the PCR Court’s ruling that Mr.\nDouglas was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and\naffirmed its disposition of the remaining claims. As to the length\nof the delay, the Appellate Division held that “a three-year delay\ndoes not by itself give rise to prejudice or denial of the right to\nspeedy trial.” State v.

Id. at 172-73.\n        The Appellate Division determined that the reason for the\ndelay was the appellate process. “[I]n no event can it be said that\nadvising defendant of his need to pursue an appeal and reliance by\nthe courts and PD on that requirement, as required by law at the\ntime of the PD’s decision, was a deliberate attempt to hamper the\ndefense.” Id. Regarding the third Barker factor, the Appellate\nDivision did not specifically discuss whether Mr. Douglas had\npreserved his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial before the\ntrial court.\n       The Appellate Division further held that Mr. Douglas failed\nto demonstrate prejudice because “Gaskins died months before the\n[February 22, 1990] motion was filed.” Id. at 174. “[A]ny\nprejudice concerning Gaskins’ death is merely speculative,” id.,\nand, in light of the weight of other evidence presented at trial,\nincluding the testimony of the surviving victim, “the testimony of\nall the officers that defendant had a loaded handgun in his\npossession at the time of his arrest in the Gaskins’ apartment, and\nthe discovery of the holster in defendant’s apartment,” Mr.\nGaskins’ testimony would not have impacted the verdict.

Supp. 2d at 421.\n       Mr. Douglas has correctly pointed out that the District Court\nin one place misquoted the standard of review under 28 U.S.C. §\n2254(d)(2) and that the misstatement was quite similar to one of\ntwo errors we identified in Johnson v.

The District Court stated that\nis was “constrained to deny Petitioner relief on this ground because\nthe Appellate Division’s decision did not involve an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established federal law . . . .” Id.\nAccordingly, the District Court held that the strict standard set\nforth in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) compelled the denial of Mr.\nDouglas’s habeas corpus petition. This Court is bound by that\nsame strict standard.\n       As evidenced by the decision of the Appellate Division,\nreasonable jurists may disagree as to the correct disposition of Mr.\nDouglas’s speedy trial claim. However, because the decision by\nthe Appellate Division was not objectively unreasonable, we must\naffirm. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 411 (“Under § 2254(d)(1)’s\n‘unreasonable application’ clause, then, a federal habeas court may\nnot issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its\nindependent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied\nclearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather,\nthat application must also be unreasonable.”).\n\n\n\n                                22\n\f        The Appellate Division recognized that the three year period\nfrom Mr. Douglas’s arrest to the commencement of trial was of\nsufficient length that it was required to make a full inquiry into and\nto balance each of the Barker factors to determine whether he was\ndenied his right to a speedy trial. The record shows that ADPD\nDouglas was appointed to represent Mr. Douglas on August 12,\n1987, three days after his arrest. The OPD withdrew from\nrepresenting Mr. Douglas on January 21, 1988 because it had\nconcluded that Mr. Douglas was ineligible for appointed counsel.\nDuring that period of representation, ADPD Douglas met with his\nclient, prepared a witness list, and authorized the interrogation of\npotential defense witnesses. Mr. Douglas was not represented by\ncounsel for nine months and twelve days because of the procedural\nconfusion caused by the change in the statute transferring the\ndetermination of indigency from the OPD to the trial court.\n        ADPD Kapin testified during the PCR Court proceedings\nthat in his experience, it is not uncommon to spend two to three\nyears preparing for the trial of a capital case. Mr. Douglas’s case\ncame to trial three years after he was charged.\n        With respect to the length of the delay, the Appellate\nDivision noted that three years was not an extraordinary pretrial\nperiod for a capital case, citing data indicating that such cases\ncommonly take at least two years to get to trial. The court\nexplained that this was in part due to the fact that counsel were\nrequired to prepare during that period not only a defense to a very\nserious charge but also the defendant’s mitigating factor position\nfor the penalty phase.\n        In Barker, the prosecution sought and obtained a series of\nsixteen continuances to facilitate the prosecution of Silas Manning,\nWillie Barker’s cohort. 407 U.S. at 516-17. The prosecutors in\nBarker believed they needed to first obtain Mr. Manning’s\nconviction in order to avoid the assertion by Mr. Manning of his\nprivilege against self-incrimination and assure his testimony\nagainst Mr. Barker.

Here, by contrast, the two principal\nreasons for the delay were the good faith albeit erroneous\nconclusion by the OPD that Mr. Douglas was not an indigent and\nthe failure of the trial judge to inform Mr. Douglas until August 18,\n1988 that, due to a change in the law in April, indigency\ndeterminations were no longer the responsibility of the OPD.\n\n                                 23\n\fWhile the “ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest\nwith the government rather than with the defendant,” 407 U.S. at\n531, the record in this case shows that there was no deliberate\nattempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense. The trial\ncourt scheduled several hearings in order to learn about Mr.\nDouglas’s efforts to retain private counsel and the progress of his\nefforts to demonstrate that he was an indigent.\n        With regard to the reason for the three-year pretrial delay in\nthis case, the Appellate Division concluded that “[a]ll pretrial time\nwas productively used once defense counsel were assigned, and\nwhen they asked that a trial date be set, it was fixed in accordance\nwith a schedule satisfactory to the defense.” Douglas, 322 N.J.\nSuper. at 171. As to the proceeding period, the court found that\n“the judiciary’s failure to be more aggressive in reviewing\ndefendant’s claim of indigency” was not excusable. At the same\ntime, it concluded that “in no event [could] it be said that advising\ndefendant of his need to pursue an appeal and the reliance of the\ncourt and the PD on that requirement . . . was a deliberate attempt\nto hamper the defense.” Id. at 171-72.\n        “A defendant who fails to demand a speedy trial [does not]\nforever [waive] his right.” 407 U.S. at 528. However, “failure to\nassert the right will make it difficult for [petitioner] to prove that he\nwas denied a speedy trial.” Id. at 532. A pro se criminal defendant\ndoes not have to make a procedurally perfect assertion of his\nspeedy trial rights, but must make a “reasonable assertion” of the\nright so as to put authorities on notice of his Sixth Amendment\nclaim. Gov’t of the Virgin Is. v. Pemberton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484653\"><a href=\"/opinion/484653/government-of-the-virgin-islands-v-arthur-pemberton/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 629 (3d\nCir. 1987).\n       Whether or not the February 22, 1990 motion can be\nconstrued as one for a speedy trial,6 it is clear from the record that\n\n       6\n        When ADPD Kapin was asked at Mr. Douglas’s PCR\nhearing whether the February 22, 1990 motion was a “speedy\ntrial” motion, he stated that “whether it’s called a speedy-trial\nmotion, I believe the effect was basically the same, we wanted a\nspeedy trial date . . . .” He also testified, however, that Mr.\nDouglas would have been prejudiced by an unsuccessful motion\nto dismiss on speedy trial grounds because it would have\nrevealed his trial strategy.\n\n                                   24\n\fMr. Douglas made a “reasonable assertion” of his Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. As Mr. Douglas points out in\nthis appeal, his well-documented efforts to secure counsel are\nproperly viewed as part and parcel of his efforts to assert his Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. Mr. Douglas’s continuous\nrequests for counsel were founded, in large part, on his concern\nthat he be given an opportunity to prove his innocence before\nevidence was lost. For example, in his correspondence of May 16,\n1988 with Public Defender Slocum, Mr. Douglas expressed\nconcern over the delay in his case:\n               During the five months I was being\n               represented by the Office of the Public\n               Defender, Essex Region, to my\n               knowledge, only four statements were\n               obtained. Three individuals, Mr.\n               Donald Well [address omitted]; Mr.\n               Calvin Bonds [address omitted]; and\n               Mr. Gene Sutton, address unknown,\n               came to the Office of the Public\n               Defender to make statements, but no\n               statements were taken from these\n               persons.\n\n\n               To prove my innocence, it is\n               imperative that I have a fair trial with\n               proper representation and competent\n               defense presentation.\n\n\nIn his July 25, 1988 letter to Judge Falcone, Mr. Douglas wrote:\n“Conducting an investigation, locating witnesses and relying on\nmemories after a year may be tenuous at best. Day by day the\nchances that I may be able to prove my innocence may, perhaps,\nbecome more and more remote.” Mr. Douglas’s assertion of his\nright to a speedy trial alone, however, is not sufficient to undermine\nthe overall reasonableness of the Appellate Division’s Barker\nanalysis. See Barker, 407 U.S. at 533 (“none of the four factors\nidentified . . . [is] either a necessary or sufficient condition to the\nfinding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial”).\n\n                                  25\n\f        Finally, on the question of prejudice, the Barker Court held\nthat “[i]f witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is\nobvious.” Barker, 407 U.S. at 532. The Barker Court also\ninstructed, however, that\n              [w]e regard none of the four factors\n              identified above as either a necessary\n              or sufficient condition to the finding\n              of a deprivation of the right of speedy\n              trial. Rather, they are related factors\n              and must be considered together with\n              such other circumstances as may be\n              relevant. In sum, these factors have\n              no talismanic qualities; courts must\n              still engage in a difficult and sensitive\n              balancing process.\n\n\nId. at 533.\n       The Appellate Division concluded that there is\n              nothing in the record to suggest that\n              defendant was unduly prejudiced by\n              the delay which can be attributable to\n              the assignment of counsel at the outset\n              of capital proceedings.            Such\n              proceedings would have, of necessity\n              by virtue of the needs of the defense\n              team in a capital case, carried beyond\n              the death of Irving Gaskins or any\n              other event which defendant points to\n              as the basis for his claim of prejudice.\n\n\nDouglas, 322 N.J. Super. at 173.\n        Mr. Gaskins died in September 1989, approximately twenty-\nfive months after Mr. Douglas’s arrest. The record shows that the\ndefense team’s need to prepare for trial and a a possible penalty\nphase in a capital case would have continued beyond the date of\nMr. Gaskins’s death. ADPD Kapin testified that in his experience,\n“it is not uncommon to spend two to three years in preparing for\n\n                                 26\n\ftrial.” Here, the record shows that the defense team was not\nprepared to request a trial date until five months after Mr. Gaskins\ndied. Furthermore, as noted by the Appellate Division\n              any prejudice concerning Gaskins’\n              death is merely speculative. . . . [T]he\n              nature of Gaskins’ statement regarding\n              what he did not see without a fuller\n              explanation of what he did observe . .\n              . does not warrant the granting of post-\n              conviction relief on the grounds that\n              defendant was prejudiced by virtue of\n              the pretrial delay.\n\n\nDouglas, 322 N.J. Super. at 175. We conclude that the Appellate\nDivision’s balancing of the Barker factors was not objectively\nunreasonable.\n                                  C\n        Mr. Douglas argues that habeas corpus relief should be\ngranted because he was denied counsel at a critical stage during the\nprosecutorial process. “[A] constitutional violation is per se\nprejudicial only if the error occurs during a ‘critical stage’ of the\nprosecutorial process.” Bell v.

Mr. Douglas has failed\nto demonstrate that he was denied counsel at a critical stage in the\nproceedings.\n                                  D\n      Mr. Douglas alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the\nground that his trial counsel failed to move for dismissal due to the\nextended pretrial delay. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\n                                 27\n\fare evaluated pursuant to the standard enunciated in Strickland v.\nWashington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). It has two components. “First,\nthe defendant must show that counsel’s performance was\ndeficient.” Id. at 687. When a convicted defendant complains of\nineffective counsel, the defendant must show that counsel’s\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\nId. at 687-88. “Second, the defendant must show that the deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defense.” Id. at 687. And Mr. Douglas\nmust show there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\nunprofessional errors, if any, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different. Id. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id.\n         Judicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly\ndeferential because “it is all too tempting for a defendant to second-\nguess counsel’s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and\nit is all too easy for a court, . . . to conclude that a particular act or\nomission of counsel was unreasonable.” Id. at 689. “A fair\nassessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be\nmade to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight. . . .” Id.\n        The District Court correctly concluded that the PCR Court’s\ndecision, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division without\ncomment, was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of,\nthe two-part Strickland test. ADPD Kapin testified at the PCR\nCourt proceedings that he could not imagine that, given the nature\nof this case, a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with speedy\ntrial requirements would have been granted. He stated that he was\nmore concerned about getting the case set for a trial so it could be\nlitigated. He also stated that making a motion for a dismissal on\nspeedy trial grounds would have required disclosure of the defense\ntrial strategy and, in his opinion, would have been denied. We\nagree with the PCR Court that Mr. Douglas has failed to\ndemonstrate that his attorneys’ performance was defective.\n       We also agree with the PCR Court’s determination that Mr.\nDouglas has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his\ncounsels’ failure to move for a dismissal on speedy trial grounds\nbased on the death of Mr. Gaskins prior to the trial date. As the\nAppellate Division observed, “any prejudice concerning Gaskins’\ndeath is merely speculative.” State v. Douglas, 322 N.J. Super. at\n174 (addressing the fourth Barker factor in analyzing Mr.\n\n                                   28\n\fDouglas’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial). The Appellate\nDivision continued,\n                 given the identification of defendant\n                 by Ms. Broadway, the testimony of all\n                 th officers that defendant had a loaded\n                 handgun in his possession at the time\n                 of his arrest in the Gaskins apartment,\n                 and the discovery of the holster in\n                 defendant’s apartment, all as detailed\n                 in our opinion on direct appeal, we\n                 conclude that Gaskins’ death (coming\n                 as it did after the Public Defender’s\n                 interview without an endeavor to\n                 preserve his testimony, the nature of\n                 Gaskins’ statement regarding what he\n                 did observe, and the giving of that\n                 statement long before a motion was\n                 made to fix a trial date) does not\n                 warrant the granting of post-\n                 conviction relief on the grounds that\n                 defendant was prejudiced by virtue of\n                 the pretrial delay.\nId. at 174-75.\n       We agree with the Appellate Division’s reasoning with\nrespect to Barker’s fourth “prejudice” factor.7 Mr. Douglas has\n\n       7\n        Judge Stapleton agrees that Mr. Douglas has not satisfied\nStrickland’s second prong because a motion to dismiss on\nspeedy trial grounds would have been unsuccessful. To the\nextent our conclusion on this issue or our conclusion regarding\nprejudice under Barker, rests on the assertion that Gaskins’s\ntestimony would not have been helpful to Mr. Douglas, Judge\nStapleton disagrees. In his view, even if Gaskins’s testimony\nhad been regarded as helpful to the defense, a speedy trial\nmotion would have been properly denied because, as the\nAppellate Division also concluded, there was no causal nexus\nbetween the unexcused nine month delay and the loss of\nGaskins’s testimony; that loss would have occurred even if there\nhad been no such delay.\n\n                                   29\n\ffailed to demonstrate that the Appellate Division’s conclusion, (1)\nthat his counsel were not ineffective in failing to move for a\ndismissal, and (2) that he was not denied a speedy trial due to the\nfact that Mr. Gaskins died before trial, was objectively\nunreasonable. Accordingly, the decision of the District Court will\nbe AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                30\n\f</pre>",
