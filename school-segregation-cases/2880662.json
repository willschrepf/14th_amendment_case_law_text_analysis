Conclusion\n\n\n       At the center of this securities fraud action is Suprema\nSpecialties, Inc. (“Suprema”), a now-defunct company that\npresented itself as a producer and distributor of all natural\ngourmet Italian cheeses. Over a two-year period, Suprema\n\n                                4\n\freported wildly successful growth in its sales and receivables,\nthereby enticing lenders to increase its credit line and luring\ninvestors to the purchase of its stock. In truth, Suprema had\nfabricated millions of dollars in cheese sales and engaged in\nother fraudulent schemes that ultimately led to the company’s\ndissolution in bankruptcy. Government investigations resulted\nin four individuals connected to Suprema’s schemes pleading\nguilty to federal charges of, inter alia, conspiracy to commit\nsecurities fraud. Those individuals have admitted that a number\nof Suprema’s public statements regarding its finances and the\nnature of its business were untrue.\n\n        The plaintiffs-appellants here are two institutional\ninvestors, Special Situations Fund, III, L.P., and Special\nSituations Fund Cayman, L.P. (collectively, the “SSF\nPlaintiffs”), and the Teachers’ Retirement System of Louisiana\n(referred to as “Lead Class Plaintiff” because it held that status\nin the consolidated class actions before the District Court). SSF\nPlaintiffs and Lead Class Plaintiff brought separate actions for\ndamages against Suprema’s former officers and directors, its\nauditor, and several investment firms that served as underwriters\nin two public stock offerings through which plaintiffs claim to\nhave acquired Suprema stock. Plaintiffs asserted claims for\nrelief under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of\n1933 (the “Securities Act”), and Sections 10(b), 18, and 20 of\nthe Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”),\nalong with fraud and misrepresentation claims under state law.\nOn defendants’ motions, the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of New Jersey dismissed all claims pursuant to Rules\n9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as\nwell as provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct (“PSLRA”). Among the important issues presented on\nappeal is whether the District Court properly applied the “sounds\nin fraud” doctrine in dismissing the claims asserted under\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) despite plaintiffs’ efforts to\nground their Securities Act claims in negligence and to plead\nthem separately in the complaints from their fraud-based claims.\nWe will reverse the District Court’s orders dismissing the claims\nunder Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act and\nSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act as to some of the defendants,\nand we will affirm as to the dismissal of the remaining counts.\n\n                                 5\n\fWe will remand as to the state law claims.\n\n                                 I.\n\n       In setting forth the underlying facts, we accept as true the\nwell-pleaded allegations in plaintiffs’ second amended\ncomplaints and consider the documents incorporated by\nreference therein. See Cal. Pub. Employees Ret. Sys. v. Chubb\nCorp., 394 F.3d 126, 134 (3d Cir. 2004) (hereinafter\n“CALPERS”).\n\nA. The Rise and Fall of Suprema\n\n       Suprema was founded as a New York non-public\ncorporation in 1983. It became a publicly traded company in\n1991 and was listed on the NASDAQ (trading under the symbol\n“CHEZ”) in 1993. Suprema had its corporate headquarters,\nalong with a processing plant, in Paterson, New Jersey, and it\noperated three wholly-owned subsidiaries, at which it\nmanufactured and processed cheese, in Manteca, California;\nOgdensburg, New York; and Blackfoot, Idaho. Suprema’s\nbusiness was divided between two product lines: “hard cheese,”\nwhich included imported and domestically produced parmesan\nand romano, and “soft-cheese,” which included domestically\nproduced mozzarella, ricotta, and provolone.\n\n        Defendant-Appellee Mark Cocchiola was a founder of\nSuprema and acted as the company’s Executive Vice-President,\nCEO, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Defendant-\nAppellee Steven Venechanos was the company’s CFO and\nSecretary, and also a member of the Board of Directors during\nthe Class Period. (Cocchiola and Venechanos will be referred to\ncollectively as the “Officers.”) Defendants-Appellees Marco\nCocchiola (Mark Cocchiola’s father), Rudolph Acosta, Jr., Paul\nDeSocio, and Barry Rutcofsky (collectively, the “Outside\nDirectors”) were members of the Board of Directors. (We will\nrefer to Mark Cocchiola simply as “Cocchiola” and to Marco\nCocchiola by his full name.) Marco Cocchiola was also\nSuprema’s Operations Manager. Acosta, DeSocio, and\nRutcofsky were members of the Board’s Audit Committee.\nDefendant-Appellee BDO Seidman, LLP (“BDO”) was\n\n                                 6\n\fSuprema’s auditor throughout the class period.\n\n        In 2000 and 2001, Suprema reported dramatic growth in\nsales and receivables, which it attributed primarily to growth in\nsales of its domestically manufactured hard cheeses. Suprema’s\nnet sales for fiscal year 2000 increased to $278.4 million,\nreflecting a 58% increase over fiscal year 1999, and for fiscal\nyear 2001, increased to $420.3 million, or 51% over fiscal year\n2000. In its hard cheese business alone, Suprema reported 400%\ngrowth in revenue between fiscal year 1999 and the end of fiscal\nyear 2001. Its receivables were reported to have grown from\n$36 million at the end of fiscal year 1999 to $101.8 million by\nthe end of fiscal year 2001. During this same period, industry-\nwide growth in sales was only approximately 9% per year. In\nSeptember 2001, FORTUNE MAGAZINE named Suprema the\ntwenty-third fastest growing small company in the United States,\nand shortly thereafter FORBES MAGAZINE ranked it as the\ntwenty-second best small company. Between the fourth quarter\nof 1998 and the fourth quarter of 2000, the company’s average\nshare price more than doubled.\n\n        State and federal investigations subsequently revealed\nthat Suprema’s explosive growth was an illusion– the product of\na fraudulent scheme involving so-called round-trip sales or\ncircular transactions associated with the hard cheese side of its\nbusiness. The round-trip sales scheme was one in which\nSuprema purportedly sold hard cheese products to entities posing\nas customers, which then sold the fictitious products to entities\nposing as suppliers. The “suppliers,” in turn, sold the products\nback to Suprema. In most cases, the customer and the supplier\nin these sales shared a common owner who would reap\ncommissions on the fictitious transactions. According to a civil\ncomplaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) in 2004, fictitious sales accounted for approximately\n30%, 65%, 85% and 87% of Suprema’s accounts receivable for\nfiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001.\n\n       Millions of dollars in company checks– some signed by\nCocchiola, some by Venechanos, and some by both– were\nissued to ostensible “suppliers” during 2001. The apparent\nincrease in net sales and accounts receivable brought increases in\n\n                                7\n\fthe company’s line of credit. Suprema’s credit line increased\nfrom $35 million in 1998 to $140 million in 2001. The increased\ncredit line led to an expansion in the volume and value of\nfictitious round-trip sales, which in turn led to further increases\nin accounts receivable, thereby fueling the increased line of\ncredit. The ever-widening cycle produced the appearance, on\npaper, of phenomenal growth.\n\n        The invoices issued in connection with the circular\nscheme generally did not correspond to any actual shipments.\nSome of the “ship to” locations identified in invoices for huge\nquantities of cheese were nothing more than postal boxes,\nstorefronts, or single-family residences. The shipments that\nwere actually made contained mislabeled or adulterated cheese\nproducts that were generally unfit for human consumption.\nSuprema purchased imitation cheeses and other non-cheese\nproducts and relabeled them as higher-priced premium cheeses,\nand it adulterated its “all natural” cheeses with fillers to reduce\ncosts and increase sales. Inventory impounded by the\ngovernment in connection with its investigations turned out to\nhave been grossly overvalued and was actually worth less than\n$2 million, though Suprema had represented it in December\n2001 as worth more than $60 million.\n\n        On December 21, 2001, just six weeks after Suprema\nconducted a substantial public stock offering (discussed below),\nVenechanos and Suprema’s controller, Arthur Christensen,\nresigned, and the company announced that it had initiated an\ninternal investigation into its previously reported financial\nresults. In response to this announcement, NASDAQ suspended\ntrading of Suprema’s stock. On January 25, 2002, the company\nannounced that it had engaged Deloitte & Touche, LLP to\ncontinue the investigation.\n\n       From that point, Suprema and the fraudulent scheme upon\nwhich its apparent success had been founded unraveled quickly.\nOn February 4, 2002, federal authorities executed a search\nwarrant at Suprema’s headquarters and seized financial and\nmanufacturing records. Thereafter, Suprema revealed that it was\nbeing criminally investigated by the FBI, the FDA, the SEC, and\nthe New Jersey Department of Agriculture. On February 18,\n\n                                 8\n\f2002, BDO resigned as Suprema’s auditor, citing, among other\nreasons, an inability to determine whether the company had\nadequate internal controls necessary to develop reliable financial\nstatements, whether Suprema’s prior financial statements\ncontained material inaccuracies, and whether it could rely on\nmanagement’s representations.\n\n        On February 24, 2002, Suprema filed for Chapter 11\nbankruptcy protection. On the same day, it announced that\nCocchiola had resigned as CEO and that NASDAQ would be de-\nlisting its stock as of March 1, 2002. On March 20, 2002, the\ncompany’s Chapter 11 reorganization was converted into a\nChapter 7 liquidation, and a liquidation trustee was appointed.\n\n        On January 7, 2004, four individuals associated with the\ncompany– the former Operations Manager of the Paterson plant,\nJohn Van Sickell,1 and the principals of three companies that had\nbeen Suprema’s ostensible customers or suppliers, Lawrence\nFransen, George Vieira, and Robert Quattrone– pled guilty to\nfederal charges of, inter alia, conspiracy to commit securities\nfraud, bank fraud, and mail fraud in connection with the round-\ntrip sales scheme. In their plea allocutions, all four individuals\nadmitted that their criminal actions, including participation in the\ninvoicing scheme and adulteration of products, were undertaken\nat the direction and under the supervision of, or with the\nknowledge of and in conjunction with, Suprema’s management.\nThe criminal informations filed by the United States Attorney in\nthe case alleged that $700 million of Suprema’s $1.2 billion in\nnet sales between 1996 and 2002 (87% of all sales made to the\ncompanies controlled by Fransen, Vieira, and Quattrone) were\nentirely fictitious.2\n\n\n       1\n        Van Sickell had worked as an assistant to the company’s\nformer Executive Vice-President, Paul Lauriero, who died in\nAugust 2001. Following Lauriero’s death, Cocchiola assumed his\nresponsibilities, which included overseeing the company’s general\noperations and its procurement of raw materials for production.\n       2\n       At the time the District Court decided the motions to\ndismiss, neither Cocchiola nor Venechanos was under indictment.\n\n                                 9\n\fB. The Secondary Offerings\n\n        Suprema conducted two public stock offerings relevant to\nthis action: the first was in August 2000 (the “2000 Offering”),\nand the second was in November 2001 (the “2001 Offering”).\nThe 2000 Offering was for 1.2 million shares of common stock.\nIt was underwritten by, inter alia, defendants-appellees\nOberweis.net; Paulson Investment Co.; Westminster Securities\nCorp.; and Westport Resources (collectively, the “2000\nUnderwriters”).3 On May 10, 2000, Suprema filed a registration\nstatement and prospectus on Form S-2 with the SEC announcing\nthe offering. Cocchiola, Venechanos, Marco Cocchiola, Acosta,\nand DeSocio signed the Form S-2. The Form S-2 incorporated\nby reference Suprema’s annual report on Form 10-K filed on\nJune 30, 1999, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed on\nSeptember 30 and December 31, 1999, and its proxy statement\n\n\n\nPursuant to a motion to expand the record on appeal, which we\ngranted, SSF Plaintiffs submitted a Supplemental Appendix\ncontaining a 38-count grand jury indictment of those individuals in\nconnection with their activities at Suprema. The indictment, which\nwas brought in the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey, charges Cocchiola and Venechanos with, inter alia,\nconspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and making false\nstatements to the SEC. Because the indictments of Cocchiola and\nVenechanos were not part of the record below, we do not consider\nthem for purposes of this appeal.\n       3\n         The 2000 Offering was also underwritten by Hobbs\nMelville Securities Corp.; Auerbach, Pollak & Richardson, Inc.;\nGirard Securities, Inc.; and Mercer Partners, Inc. These four\ncompanies were named as defendants by the SSF Plaintiffs but\nnever entered appearances in the action. There is no indication on\nthe district court docket that the SSF Plaintiffs served process upon\nthem. Counsel for SSF Plaintiffs suggested at oral argument before\nthis court that “some” of these defendants “are being represented\nby Oberweis.net,” but we find no indication that this is the case.\nTr. Oral Arg. at 55. Given the SSF Plaintiffs’ failure to brief any\nissue concerning the non-appearance of these underwriters, we\nconclude that any claims against them are not properly before us.\n\n                                 10\n\ffiled on October 22, 1999.\n\n       The 2001 Offering was for 4.05 million shares of\ncommon stock. It was underwritten by defendants-appellees\nJanney Montgomery Scott, LLC; Pacific Growth Equities, Inc.;\nand Roth Capital Partners, LLC (collectively, the “2001\nUnderwriters”). Cocchiola, Venechanos, Marco Cocchiola,\nAcosta, DeSocio, and Rutcofsky signed the Form S-2 filed with\nthe SEC in connection with the offering. The Form S-2\nincorporated by reference Suprema’s annual report on Form 10-\nK filed on September 28, 2001. By the close of the 2001\nOffering, Suprema had sold 3.5 million shares for proceeds of\n$41.5 million.\n\n        BDO issued unqualified audit opinions in August 1999\nand August 2001 regarding Suprema’s consolidated financial\nstatements for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001. The audit\nopinions were incorporated into the Form S-2s that Suprema\nfiled for the 2000 and 2001 Offerings. BDO stated that it had\nperformed its audits in accordance with Generally Accepted\nAuditing Standards (“GAAS”)4 and that, in its opinion,\n        the consolidated financial statements … present\n        fairly, in all material respects, the financial\n        position of [Suprema and its wholly owned\n        subsidiaries] as of June 30, 2000 and 2001, and the\n        results of their operations and their cash flows for\n        each of the three years in the period ended June 30,\n        2001, in conformity with generally accepted\n        accounting principles.\n\nApp. at 195, 903.\n\n      SSF Plaintiffs allege that they purchased 250,000 shares\nof Suprema common stock in the 2000 Offering at a price of\n\n\n      4\n       GAAS are the standards established by the Auditing\nStandards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for the conduct of auditors performing an\nexamination. See In re IKON Office Solutions, Inc. Sec. Litig.,\n277 F.3d 658, 664 n.5 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n                              11\n\f$8.00 per share, reflecting a total investment of $2,000,000. SSF\nPlaintiffs allegedly made additional purchases of Suprema stock\nat various prices throughout 2000 and 2001. SSF Plaintiffs then\nallegedly purchased 13,000 shares, at $12.75 per share, from\nunderwriter Pacific Growth Equities, and averred in the\ncomplaint that the shares were “traceable to” the 2001 Offering.\nApp. at 268. Lead Class Plaintiff, a public pension fund\norganized for the benefit of current and retired public school\nteachers of the State of Louisiana, alleges that it purchased\n47,000 shares of Suprema stock, at $12.75 per share, from\nunderwriter Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC, on the date of the\n2001 Offering. Lead Class Plaintiff makes no claim in this\naction based on the 2000 Offering.\n\nC. Procedural History\n\n       Following the revelation in December 2001 that Suprema\nwas conducting an internal investigation, numerous putative\nclass action suits were filed, including Lead Class Plaintiff’s suit\non January 14, 2002. The District Court consolidated the cases,\npursuant to provisions of the PSLRA, and appointed Lead Class\nPlaintiff to represent the class on July 1, 2002. See Smith v.\nSuprema Specialities, Inc., 206 F. Supp. 2d 627 (D.N.J. 2002).\nSSF Plaintiffs filed a separate, non-class complaint on June 27,\n2002, raising similar claims against most of the same parties.\n\n        Following its appointment, Lead Class Plaintiff filed an\namended class complaint on September 11, 2002. SSF Plaintiffs\nfiled an amended complaint on September 17, 2002. The\nDistrict Court consolidated the two cases for pre-trial\nproceedings. Thereafter, the District Court granted defendants’\nmotions to dismiss all claims in the amended complaints,\nconcluding that “the complaints lack the factual specificity\ndemanded by the PSLRA and may not be so maintained.” App.\nat 474. In its order, the District Court afforded plaintiffs leave to\nfile a motion to amend the complaints to cure, if possible, what it\nidentified as the defects in plaintiffs’ pleading of the claims.\nPlaintiffs so moved, and defendants opposed the motion.\n\n     On the day scheduled for oral argument on the motion to\namend, January 8, 2004, counsel for Lead Class Plaintiff\n\n                                 12\n\finformed the District Court that Van Sickell, Fransen, Vieira,\nand Quattrone had entered their guilty pleas on the previous day.\nIn view of this new information, the parties agreed that plaintiffs\nshould be granted leave to file second amended complaints in\nwhich they could incorporate newly discovered facts arising out\nof the criminal informations and guilty pleas. Accordingly,\nplaintiffs filed their respective second amended complaints on\nJanuary 30, 2004.\n\n       Lead Class Plaintiff’s second amended complaint asserted\nviolations of Section 11 of the Securities Act by all defendants;\nSection 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act by the Officers and 2001\nUnderwriters; Section 15 of the Securities Act by the Officers;\nSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act by the Officers and BDO;\nand Section 20 of the Exchange Act by the Officers. Lead Class\nPlaintiff brought suit on its own behalf and on behalf of all those\nwho acquired Suprema common stock in the 2001 Offering\npursuant to the registration statement, or acquired Suprema\ncommon stock during the class period of September 27, 2000\nthrough December 21, 2001, and sustained a loss as a result.\n\n       SSF Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint asserted\nviolations of the following provisions: Section 11 by all\ndefendants; Section 12(a)(2) by the Officers and (non-appearing\ndefendant) Hobbs Melville; Section 15 by the Officers and the\nOutside Directors; Section 18 of the Exchange Act by the\nOfficers, the Outside Directors, and BDO; Section 10(b) by all\ndefendants; Section 20 by the Officers and the Outside\nDirectors; and common law fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation by all defendants.\n\n        Although plaintiffs added a host of new allegations\narising out of the Suprema criminal investigations and\nindictments, all defendants again moved to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim. The District Court granted the motions and\ndismissed the second amended complaints in their entirety. See\nIn re Suprema, 334 F. Supp. 2d 637 (D.N.J. 2004). The District\nCourt dismissed plaintiffs’ Section 11 and 12(a)(2) claims on the\nground that those claims “sounded in fraud” and failed to satisfy\nthe heightened pleading requirement of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 9(b) for averments of fraud. The District Court\n\n                                13\n\fdismissed plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims for failure adequately\nto plead scienter; it dismissed SSF Plaintiffs’ Section 18 claims\nfor failure adequately to plead actual reliance on alleged material\nmisstatements; and it dismissed plaintiffs’ Section 15 and\nSection 20(a) control-person claims for failure adequately to\nplead underlying violations by the Officers. The District Court\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the SSF\nPlaintiffs’ state law claims.\n\n       Plaintiffs each timely filed a notice of appeal from the\ndismissal of their respective second amended complaints. This\ncourt consolidated the appeals for disposition. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the grant of\na motion to dismiss is de novo. In re NAHC Sec. Litig., 306\nF.3d 1314, 1322-23 (3d Cir. 2002). We must accept as true the\nfactual allegations in the second amended complaints and may\naffirm the dismissals only if it appears certain that plaintiffs can\nprove no set of facts that would entitle them to relief. See\nRansom v. Marrazzo, 848 F.2d 398, 401 (3d Cir. 1988).\n\n                                 II.\n\nA. Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) Claims\n\n        The District Court dismissed plaintiffs’ Section 11 and\nSection 12(a)(2) claims because it found, upon review of the\nallegations in the second amended complaints, that the claims\n“sound in fraud.” As a result, the District Court required\nplaintiffs to meet the heightened pleading requirements of Rule\n9(b) and held that plaintiffs failed to do so. We exercise plenary\nreview over the legal question whether the Section 11 or Section\n12(a)(2) claims sound in fraud and are therefore subject to Rule\n9(b). See CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 160.\n\n       “The primary innovation of the [Securities] Act was the\ncreation of federal duties – for the most part, registration and\ndisclosure obligations – in connection with public offerings.”\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 571 (1995); see also In\nre Adams Golf, Inc. Sec. Litig., 381 F.3d 267, 273 (3d Cir.\n2004). As relevant here, Section 11 concerns material\nmisstatements or omissions in registration statements, while\n\n                                 14\n\fsection 12(a)(2) concerns material misrepresentations in\nprospectuses and other solicitation materials. Adams, 381 F.3d\nat 273.\n\n        Under Section 11, “a private action for damages may be\nbrought ‘by any person acquiring such security’ if a registration\nstatement, as of its effective date: (1) ‘contained an untrue\nstatement of material fact’; (2) ‘omitted to state a material fact\nrequired to be stated therein’; or (3) omitted to state a material\nfact ‘necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.’”\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 167 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 77k(a)). As\nthe Supreme Court has explained, Section 11 “was designed to\nassure compliance with the disclosure provisions of the Act by\nimposing a stringent standard of liability on the parties who play\na direct role in a registered offering.” Herman & MacLean v.\nHuddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 381-82 (1983) (footnote omitted). A\nSection 11 claim may be brought against the issuer of securities,\nits directors or partners, underwriters, and accountants who\nprepared or certified the registration statement. Id. at 382 n.13\n(citing § 77k(a)). Section 11 is a “virtually absolute liability\nprovision[ ], which do[es] not require plaintiffs to allege that\ndefendants possessed any scienter.” In re Adams Golf, 381 F.3d\nat 274 n.7. “If a plaintiff purchased a security issued pursuant to\na registration statement, he need only show a material\nmisstatement or omission to establish his prima facie case.”\nHerman & MacLean, 459 U.S. at 382.\n\n        Section 12(a)(2) provides for civil liability for anyone\nwho offers or sells a security “by means of a prospectus or oral\ncommunication, which includes an untrue statement of material\nfact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make\nthe statements, in light of the circumstances under which they\nwere made, not misleading. . . .” 15 U.S.C. § 77l(a)(2). Like\nSection 11, Section 12(a)(2) is a “virtually absolute” liability\nprovision that does not require an allegation that defendants\npossessed scienter. In re Adams Golf, 381 F.3d at 274 n.7. To\nstate a prima facie claim under Section 12(a)(2), the plaintiff\nmust allege the purchase of securities pursuant to a materially\nfalse or misleading prospectus or oral communication. Id. at\n273.\n\n\n                                15\n\f       Fraud, as noted above, is not a necessary element to\nestablish a prima facie claim under Section 11 or Section\n12(a)(2). See Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 288. But claims under those\nprovisions can be, and often are, predicated on allegations of\nfraud. See, e.g., CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 160. We have held that\nwhere the plaintiff grounds these Securities Act claims in\nallegations of fraud – and the claims thus “sound in fraud”– the\nheightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) apply. Id. at 161-\n63; Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 288-89.5 SSF Plaintiffs urge us “to do\naway with the ‘sounds in fraud’ doctrine altogether,” SSF Br. at\n19, but this panel is bound by prior precedential decisions of this\ncourt. See 3d Cir. IOP Ch. 9.1.\n\n       Rule 9(b) provides that “[i]n all averments of fraud or\nmistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be\nstated with particularity.” Rule 9(b) serves to give defendants\n“notice of the claims against them, provide[ ] an increased\nmeasure of protection for their reputations, and reduce[ ] the\nnumber of frivolous suits brought solely to extract settlements.”\nIn re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1418\n(3d Cir. 1997). “Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to plead (1) a\nspecific false representation of material fact; (2) knowledge by\nthe person who made it of its falsity; (3) ignorance of its falsity\nby the person to whom it was made; (4) the intention that it\n\n\n       5\n         Plaintiffs argue that applying Rule 9(b) to Section 11 and\nSection 12(a)(2) claims impermissibly “create[s] new elements for\nthese statutory causes of action.” LP Br. at 24; accord SSF Br. at\n26. We have previously rejected this argument:\n\n       It does not logically flow from the fact that fraud is\n       not a necessary element of a section 11 claim that a\n       section 11 claim cannot hinge on an allegation of\n       fraud. . . . Recognizing that neither fraud nor mistake\n       is a necessary element of a cause of action under\n       section 11, we nonetheless held in Shapiro that\n       ‘when § 11 and § 12[(a)](2) claims are grounded in\n       fraud rather than negligence, Rule 9(b) applies.’\n\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 161.\n\n                                 16\n\fshould be acted upon; and (5) that the plaintiff acted upon it to\nhis [or her] damage.” Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 284. Where a\nplaintiff’s Section 11 or Section 12(a)(2) claims are not\ngrounded in allegations of fraud, the liberal notice pleading\nrequirements of Rule 8 apply. See In re Adams Golf, 381 F.3d\nat 273 n.5 (“[C]laims under the 1933 Act that do not sound in\nfraud are not held to the heightened pleading requirements of\n[Rule] 9(b).”). Rule 8 pleading merely requires “a short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Whether a Securities Act\nclaim is subject to Rule 9(b) requires an assessment of the\nparticular claim to determine whether acts of fraud on the part of\nthe defendants form the basis for the claim against them. See\nShapiro, 964 F.2d at 288 (“Rule 9(b) refers to ‘averments’ of\nfraud, and thus requires us to examine the factual allegations that\nsupport a particular legal claim.”); see also CALPERS, 394 F.3d\nat 160 (“[A]n examination of the factual allegations that support\nPlaintiffs’ section 11 claims establishes that the claims are\nindisputably immersed in unparticularized allegations of\nfraud.”).\n\n        Although, in its second amended complaint, Lead Class\nPlaintiff described its suit as arising out of a “massive fraud” at\nSuprema, stemming in particular from the allegedly material\nmisrepresentations in the registration statements that Suprema\nfiled in connection with the 2001 Offering, App. at 82, it\nprefaced its Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) counts with an\nexplicit disclaimer– “[t]his claim is not based on and does not\nsound in fraud”– prior to setting forth the factual allegations that\nsupport each claim for relief. App. at 93, 125. Lead Class\nPlaintiff made it clear that its particular claims for relief under\nthe Securities Act\n\n       are not based on any knowing or reckless\n       misconduct on the part of the defendants– i.e., they\n       do not allege, and do not sound in fraud. Rather,\n       they are premised on the fact that there were\n       material misrepresentations and omissions in the\n       Registration Statement, and the defendants’\n       negligence in failing to recognize this fact.\n\n\n                                 17\n\fApp. at 82. It expressly stated its cause of action as sounding in\nnegligence, claiming that “[h]ad they exercised reasonable care,\nthese defendants could have known of the material\nmisstatements and omissions alleged herein.” App. at 123.\n\n        In similar fashion, SSF Plaintiffs asserted at the outset\nthat their suit arises out of “one of New Jersey’s most scandalous\naccounting frauds,” App. at 260, but also stated clearly that\n“[t]his action seeks to advance negligence claims against the\nunderwriters, auditor, and signatories of Suprema’s publicly-\nfiled documents.” App. at 261. SSF Plaintiffs prefaced the\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) counts of the second amended\ncomplaint with the disclaimer that “[t]his claim is not based on\nand does not sound in fraud, and Plaintiffs expressly disclaim\nand exclude any allegation that could be construed as alleging\nfraud or intentional or reckless misconduct.” App. at 324. The\npreface to the Section 11 count further states that “this claim is\nbased . . . solely on claims of strict liability and/or negligence\nunder the Securities Act.” App. at 324. At the heart of the\nclaims was the allegation that the named defendants were\nnegligent in their failure to uncover the fraud at Suprema.\n\n        The District Court held that both complaints sound in\nfraud, mainly because “‘the wording and imputations of the\ncomplaint[s] are classically associated with fraud.’” App. at 14\n(quoting Rombach, 355 F.3d at 172). Among other things, the\nDistrict Court noted that Lead Class Plaintiff alleged that the\naction arose from a “massive fraud” and that SSF Plaintiffs had\nidentified several specific false representations of material fact in\nthe 2000 and 2001 Registration Statements upon which they\nclaimed to have relied. Thus, although the District Court\nacknowledged that plaintiffs pleaded their claims as negligence-\nbased, it held that the Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims\nsound in fraud as to all defendants. Applying the heightened\npleading standard of Rule 9(b), the District Court determined\nthat the claims must fail because plaintiffs did not allege that any\nof the defendants knew of the falsity of their statements and\nintended for the statements to be acted upon.\n\n      Lead Class Plaintiff argues that the District Court erred\nbecause (1) the second amended complaint set forth no\n\n                                 18\n\fallegations of fraud with regard to the 2001 Underwriters and\nDirectors, and (2) it was careful to separately plead the\nfraudulent conduct of the Officers and BDO in connection with\nthe Section 10(b) claims from the conduct that supported the\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims. On that basis, and on\nthe basis that the Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims were\nexpressly pled as negligence claims, Lead Class Plaintiff\ncontends that its Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims should\nnot have been held to sound in fraud. SSF Plaintiffs likewise\ncontend that their claims were based solely on the defendants’\nnegligent failure to carry out their respective responsibilities and\nnot fraud on their part.\n\n        For their part, defendants principally rely upon our\ndecision in CALPERS, where we held that the heightened\npleading of Rule 9(b) applied to a Section 11 claim despite the\nplaintiffs’ express disavowal of fraud because “the claims [were]\nindisputably immersed in unparticularized allegations of fraud,”\nand “a core theory of fraud permeate[d] the entire Second\nAmended Complaint.” CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 160. We\nconcluded that “[t]he one-sentence disavowment of fraud\ncontained within Plaintiffs’ section 11 Count . . . does not\nrequire us to infer that the claims are strict liability or negligence\nclaims, and in this case is insufficient to divorce the claims from\ntheir fraudulent underpinnings.” Id.\n\n        Although defendants are correct to observe that this case\nresembles CALPERS inasmuch as a core theory of fraud\npermeates the action, we find this case easily distinguishable\nfrom CALPERS with respect to the manner in which plaintiffs\nhave pled their Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims. Unlike\nthe plaintiffs in CALPERS, plaintiffs in this case do not merely\ndisavow already-pled allegations of fraud in connection with\ntheir Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims, leaving the court to\n“sift through [those] allegations . . . in search of some ‘lesser\nincluded’ claim of strict liability.” CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 162\n(quoting Lone Star Ladies Inv. Club v. Schlotzky’s, Inc., 238\nF.3d 363 (5th Cir. 2001)). Rather, both plaintiffs have expressly\npled negligence in connection with their Section 11 and 12(a)(2)\nclaims. We regard this difference in pleading as dispositive.\n\n\n                                 19\n\f        In CALPERS, we subjected the plaintiff’s pleading to the\nstrictures of Rule 9(b) because the complaint was “completely\ndevoid of any allegations that Defendants acted negligently.”\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 161. Similarly, in Shapiro, we held that\nRule 9(b) applied to Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims\nbecause there was “not a hint in the allegations that defendants\nwere negligent in violating §§ 11 and 12[(a)](2).” Shapiro, 964\nF.2d at 287-88. Both CALPERS and Shapiro thus presented\ncomplaints containing allegations of fraud exclusively; no\nallegations of negligence were pled in support of the Securities\nAct claims. See, e.g., Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 288 (“[W]e are not\npresented with a mixture of allegations of negligence [and]\nfraud.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted). We observed in\nShapiro that “[i]t would be unreasonable to infer a negligence\ncause of action from [nothing more than a] fleeting and obscure\nreference [in the complaint] to ‘gross negligence.’” Id. at 288\nn.18.\n\n       Other courts of appeals presented with Section 11 or\n12(a)(2) claims premised exclusively on allegations of fraud have\nfollowed our approach in Shapiro and declined to infer\nnegligence where it has not been expressly pled. See, e.g., In re\nDaou Sys., 411 F.3d 1006, 1028 (9th Cir. 2005); Rombach, 355\nF.3d at 172; Melder v. Morris, 27 F.3d 1097, 1100 n. 6 (5th Cir.\n1994). Conversely, where the claims are expressly premised on\nnegligence rather than fraud, Rule 9(b) has been held\ninapplicable. See Schwartz v. Celestial Seasonings, Inc., 124\nF.3d 1246, 1251-52 (10th Cir. 1997) (assuming arguendo that\nthe approach in Shapiro is correct and holding that Section 11\nclaim not premised on fraud did not trigger Rule 9(b) scrutiny).\n\n       We now hold that where, as here, individual defendants\nare accused in separate claims of the same complaint of having\nviolated Section 11, Section 12(a)(2), and Section 10(b), the\nSecurities Act claims do not sound in fraud if ordinary\nnegligence is expressly pled in connection with those claims. In\nsuch a case, the fraud allegations cannot be said to\n“contaminate” the Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims if the\nallegations are pled separately. We applied Rule 9(b) to the\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims in Shapiro because\n“plaintiffs did not allege ordinary negligence” and we could “see\n\n                               20\n\fno way to construct a negligence cause of action.” Shapiro, 964\nF.2d at 288. Here, ordinary negligence is alleged in the Section\n11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims, and those claims are pled\nseparately from the Section 10(b) fraud claims against the same\ndefendants. That is enough to avoid triggering Rule 9(b). A\ncontrary result would effectively preclude plaintiffs from filing\nsuit under Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) as well as Section\n10(b)(5). There is no suggestion that Congress intended such an\nincongruous approach.\n\n        To be sure, the “sounds in fraud” determination for\nSecurities Act claims will not always be clear cut in cases where\nthe plaintiff simultaneously raises claims against the same\ndefendants under a provision that requires a showing of scienter,\nlike Section 10(b). But where the plaintiff has exercised care in\ndifferentiating asserted negligence claims from fraud claims and\nin delineating the allegations that support the negligence cause\nof action as distinct from the fraud, the determination is\nstraightforward.\n\n        Lead Class Plaintiff carefully segregated its allegations of\nnegligence against the Officers and BDO from its allegations of\nfraud against those defendants. It did so by pleading its Section\n11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims in negligence before– and wholly\napart from– pleading its fraud-based Section 10(b) claims. This\nmanner of pleading makes for a clear conceptual separation in\nthe complaint between claims sounding in negligence and those\nsounding in fraud. And while Lead Class Plaintiff prefaced its\ncomplaint with a general statement that its suit “arises out of the\nmassive fraud that was perpetrated at Suprema,” App. at 82, it\nwas careful in that introductory discussion not to accuse any\nparticular defendant of acting with fraudulent intent. As to its\nclaims against the Outside Directors and Underwriters in\nparticular, there are no allegations of fraud or reckless\nmisconduct whatsoever in any count of Lead Class Plaintiff’s\nsecond amended complaint; ordinary negligence is all that is\npled.\n\n        SSF Plaintiffs were less artful in their pleading, with the\nresult that allegations of negligence and allegations of fraud\nagainst the defendants are somewhat commingled in the second\n\n                                 21\n\famended complaint. Although we view this lapse in pleading as\ninexpert, we do not regard it as fatal under the circumstances.\nThe Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims were expressly pled\nin, and limited to, negligence, with preceding allegations of\nfraud expressly disavowed in the context of those claims.6\nWhile not as “clean” as the pleading style adopted by Lead Class\nPlaintiff, the SSF Plaintiffs’ allegations as set forth were\nsufficient to give notice to the defendants of the claims against\nthem.\n\n        In holding that Rule 9(b) does not apply to Section 11 or\nSection 12(a)(2) claims that are expressly pled in negligence\neven when Section 10(b) claims against some of the same\ndefendants are pled separately in the same complaint, we adopt a\nposition that is consistent with our holdings in Shapiro and\nCALPERS, and one that has already been adopted by a number\nof district courts within our circuit. See, e.g., In re Ravisent\nTech, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. CIV.A. 00-CV-1014, 2004 WL\n1563024, at *13 (E.D. Pa. July 13, 2004) (“It appears that\nPlaintiffs’ counsel were aware of Shapiro when drafting the\ncomplaint, and were careful to plead negligence sufficiently to\navoid the heightened pleading requirements.”); In re Cendant\nCorp. Litig., 60 F. Supp. 2d 354, 364 (D.N.J. 1999) (“Unlike the\n\n\n       6\n        See, e.g., App. at 324:\n\n       Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every\n       allegation above as if set forth fully herein…[but]\n       Plaintiffs expressly disclaim and exclude any\n       allegation that could be construed as alleging fraud\n       or intentional or reckless misconduct, as this claim is\n       based on solely on [sic] claims of strict liability\n       and/or negligence under the Securities Act.\n\nAlthough we frowned upon this style of pleading in CALPERS,\n394 F.3d at 162, SSF Plaintiffs, unlike the plaintiff in CALPERS,\nexpressly pled negligence in their complaint, so the burden on a\ncourt to “sift through” allegations of fraud to identify the facts that\nsupport the Section 11 and Section 12 claims is lessened\nsubstantially.\n\n                                  22\n\fcomplaint in Shapiro, this complaint does not incorporate\nallegations of scienter and fraud into the § 11 claim.

Sept. 7,\n1993) (holding that Rule 9(b) did not apply to plaintiff’s Section\n11 count because that count sounded in negligence and did not\nincorporate allegations of fraud from a Section 10(b) count).\n\n        In short, the reputational concerns that animate Rule 9(b)\nwith respect to a defendant accused of fraud are not implicated\nwhen a defendant stands accused of nothing more than\nnegligence. Cf. Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\nIntelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993)\n(discussing the limited applicability of Rule 9(b)). Because the\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims of the plaintiffs here\nwere expressly negligence-based and pled distinctly in the\ncomplaint from the fraud-based claims, it was error for the\nDistrict Court to hold that they sound in fraud. Accordingly, we\nwill vacate the dismissal of these claims.7\n\n\n       7\n         The 2001 Underwriters and the Cocchiolas argue in the\nalternative that plaintiffs’ Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims\nshould have been dismissed for lack of standing because plaintiffs\ndid not allege that their “purchases of Suprema stock were part of\nor, in the case of § 11, were directly traceable to, public offerings\nunder the challenged registration statements.” Cocchiola Br. at 14.\nAccording to these appellees, standing for Section 11 and Section\n12(a)(2) claims “applies only to purchasers in initial stock\nofferings, not to open or secondary market purchases.” Id. at 24.\nThe District Court held that plaintiffs adequately alleged standing:\n“Because Plaintiffs have alleged that they have purchased ‘in’ or\n‘traceable to’ the 2000 and 2001 secondary offerings, Plaintiffs\nhave pled standing sufficiently at this motion to dismiss stage.”\nApp. at 13.\n\n      “For the purposes of determining standing, the court must\naccept as true all material allegations set forth in plaintiffs’\n\n                                 23\n\fcomplaint and must construe those facts in favor of the plaintiffs.”\nMariana v. Fisher, 338 F.3d 189, 205 (3d Cir. 2003) (citation\nomitted). SSF Plaintiffs alleged in their second amended complaint\nthat on August 25, 2000, they purchased 250,000 shares of “newly-\nissued Suprema common stock in the 2000 Offering.” App. at 265\n(emphasis added). They also alleged that on November 14, 2001,\nwhich was the last day of the 2001 Offering, they “purchased\n13,000 shares of Suprema stock which are traceable to the shares\nnewly-issued in the [2001 Offering].” App. at 266 (emphasis\nadded). Lead Class Plaintiff alleged that on November 8, 2001, it\npurchased 47,000 shares of Suprema common stock “in” the 2001\nOffering, making the purchase from underwriter Janney\nMontgomery. App. at 84 (emphasis added). As noted, Lead Class\nPlaintiff asserts Section 11 violations by all defendants and Section\n12(a)(2) violations by the Officers and the 2001 Underwriters. SSF\nPlaintiffs assert Section 11 violations by all defendants and Section\n12(a)(2) violations by the Officers and Hobbs Melville (one of the\nnon-appearing underwriters, see supra note 3).\n\n        We agree with the District Court that plaintiffs’ allegations\nregarding the purchases were sufficient to survive the motions to\ndismiss. By its terms, Section 11 provides that “any person\nacquiring” a security issued pursuant to a materially false\nregistration statement may sue (unless the purchaser knew about\nthe false statement). 15 U.S.C. § 77k(a) (emphasis added). As the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit has observed, “[w]e can\nfind no reason why ‘any’ as used in § 11 should not be read as the\nequivalent of ‘every’ such that every person who acquires a\nsecurity issued pursuant to an allegedly defective registration\nstatement has standing to sue under § 11.” DeMaria v. Andersen,\n318 F.3d 170, 176 (2d Cir. 2003); accord Lee v. Ernst & Young,\nLLP, 294 F.3d 969, 976-77 (8th Cir. 2002); Joseph v. Wiles, 223\nF.3d 1155, 1159 (10th Cir. 2000). We agree with this view and\nhold that plaintiffs’ assertions of purchases “in” and “traceable to”\nthe Suprema stock offerings were sufficient at the pleading stage.\nIndeed, we recognized as much in Shapiro, where plaintiffs alleged\nthat they purchased stock “pursuant to” a registration statement.\nThis court concluded that while “plaintiffs need not prove their\nshares are traceable to a false or misleading registration statement\n\n                                 24\n\fB. Section 10(b) Claims\n\n         Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act prohibits the “‘use or\nemploy, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, .\n. . [of] any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in\ncontravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission\nmay prescribe . . . .’” In re IKON, 277 F.3d at 666 (quoting 15\nU.S.C. § 78j(b)). Pursuant to this statutory authority, the\nCommission promulgated Rule 10b-5, which creates a private\ncause of action for investors harmed by materially false or\nmisleading statements. In re Advanta, 180 F.3d 525, 535 (3d\nCir. 1999). Rule 10b-5 “makes it unlawful for any person ‘[t]o\n\n\nat this early stage of the litigation, they must allege it.” Shapiro,\n964 F.2d at 286. We found that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged\ntheir Section 11 standing, adding that “[b]efore discovery takes\nplace [ ] it is impossible for plaintiffs to know whether their shares\nwere newly issued or were purchased in the secondary market.” Id.\nThe question here is likewise a factual one, to be resolved through\ndiscovery, as to whether plaintiffs can demonstrate that the shares\nthey allegedly purchased are in fact traceable to the registration\nstatement alleged to be false and misleading. See Lee, 294 F.3d at\n978; Joseph, 223 F.3d at 1159-60. If, as appellees suggest,\nplaintiffs have misrepresented the circumstances of their stock\npurchases and do not in fact have standing, appellees can raise that\nmatter at the summary judgment stage after discovery.\n\n        Similarly, Section 12(a)(2) claims concern the purchase of\nsecurities pursuant to a materially false or misleading prospectus\nor oral communication. We have recognized that the language of\nSection 12(a)(2) “should not be expanded to aftermarket trading.”\nBallay v. Legg Mason Wood Walker, Inc., 925 F.2d 682, 689 (3d\nCir. 1991). At the pleading stage, however, we accept as true\nplaintiffs’ allegations that they made their stock purchases in or\ntraceable to the Suprema public offerings. “If defendants were\neventually to prove that the shares came from the secondary\nmarket, § 12[(a)](2) would not apply, and judgment would be\nentered for them.” Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 287 n.16 (citation\nomitted).\n\n                                 25\n\fmake any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a\nmaterial fact necessary to make the statements made[,] in light of\nthe circumstances under which they were made, not misleading .\n. . in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.’” 17\nC.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b); see In re IKON, 277 F.3d at 666.\n\n       The Supreme Court has recently set forth the elements of\na Section 10(b) claim. See Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, __ U.S.\n__, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 1631 (2005). They are\n\n       (1) a material misrepresentation (or omission); (2)\n       scienter, i.e., a wrongful state of mind; (3) a\n       connection with the purchase or sale of a security;\n       (4) reliance, often referred to in cases involving\n       public securities markets (fraud-on-the-market\n       cases) as “transaction causation;” (5) economic\n       loss; and (6) “loss causation,” i.e., a causal\n       connection between the material misrepresentation\n       and the loss.\n\nId. (citations omitted). The PSLRA provides that a Section\n10(b) claim must “specify each statement alleged to have been\nmisleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is\nmisleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or\nomission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall\nstate with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.”\n15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)(B).8\n\n       The PSLRA also requires that plaintiffs plead the required\n\n\n       8\n        The purpose of the heightened pleading requirements\ncontained in the PSLRA is “to restrict abuses in securities class-\naction litigation, including: (1) the practice of filing lawsuits\nagainst issuers of securities in response to any significant change\nin stock price, regardless of defendants' culpability; (2) the\ntargeting of ‘deep pocket’ defendants; (3) the abuse of the\ndiscovery process to coerce settlement; and (4) manipulation of\nclients by class action attorneys.” In re Advanta, 180 F.3d at 531\n(citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, at 28 (1995), reprinted in\n1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 748).\n\n                                 26\n\fstate of mind with particularity. GSC Partners CDO Fund v.\nWashington, 368 F.3d 228, 237 (3d Cir. 2004); In re Advanta,\n180 F.3d at 530. Specifically, the PSLRA states in relevant part:\n\n       In any private action arising under this chapter in\n       which the plaintiff may recover money damages\n       only on proof that the defendant acted with a\n       particular state of mind, the complaint shall, with\n       respect to each act or omission alleged to violate\n       this chapter, state with particularity facts giving\n       rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\n       with the required state of mind.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2).\n\n       “‘The requisite “strong inference” of fraud may be\nestablished either (a) by alleging facts to show that defendants\nhad both motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or (b) by\nalleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of\nconscious misbehavior or recklessness.’” In re Burlington Coat\nFactory, 114 F.3d at 1418 (citations omitted). We have defined\n“recklessness” to include\n\n       “[h]ighly unreasonable (conduct), involving not\n       merely simple, or even inexcusable negligence, but\n       an extreme departure from the standards of\n       ordinary care, . . . which presents a danger of\n       misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to\n       the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must\n       have been aware of it.”\n\nSEC v. Infinity Group Co., 212 F.3d 180, 192 (3d Cir. 2000)\n(quoting McLean v. Alexander, 599 F.2d 1190, 1197 (3d Cir.\n1979)).\n\n        In addition to the PSLRA requirements, plaintiffs alleging\nfraud under the Exchange Act must also comply with the\nheightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b). GSC, 368 F.3d at\n236. As applied to Section 10(b) claims, “Rule 9(b) requires a\nplaintiff to plead (1) a specific false representation [or omission]\nof material fact; (2) knowledge by the person who made it of its\n\n                                27\n\ffalsity; (3) ignorance of its falsity by the person to whom it was\nmade; (4) the intention that it should be acted upon; and (5) that\nthe plaintiff acted upon it to his damage.” In re Rockefeller\nCenter Prop. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover,\n“Rule 9(b) requires plaintiffs to identify the source of the\nallegedly fraudulent misrepresentation or omission.” Id.\n(citation omitted). In sum, “Rule 9(b) requires, at a minimum,\nthat plaintiffs support their allegations of securities fraud with all\nof the essential factual background that would accompany ‘the\nfirst paragraph of any newspaper story’ – that is, the ‘who, what,\nwhen, where and how’ of the events at issue.” Id. at 217\n(quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory, 114 F.3d at 1422). To\nthe extent that Rule 9(b)’s allowance of general pleading with\nrespect to mental state conflicts with the PSLRA's requirement\nthat plaintiffs state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong\ninference that the defendant acted with scienter, 15 U.S.C. §\n78u-4(b)(2), the PSLRA “supersedes Rule 9(b) as it relates to\nRule 10b-5 actions.” In re Advanta, 180 F.3d at 531 n.5.\n\n1. The Officers\n\n       Plaintiffs pled the required scienter on the part of\nCocchiola and Venechanos (the “Officers”) by alleging both\nmotive and opportunity (with respect to insider stock sales) and\nstrong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or\nrecklessness (with respect to the round-trip sales scheme). The\nDistrict Court held that the alleged facts did not give rise to a\nstrong inference of the Officers’ scienter and dismissed the\nSection 10(b) claims. We conclude that plaintiffs’ allegations\nwere sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\na) Motive and Opportunity\n\n        Plaintiffs allege that Cocchiola and Venechanos sold\nsubstantial portions of their stock in the 2001 Offering and\ntherefore had the motive and opportunity to inflate the price of\ntheir stock. Although we have stated that “[w]e will not infer\nfraudulent intent from the mere fact that some officers sold\nstock,” we also stated that sales of company stock by insiders\nthat are “unusual in scope or timing . . . may support an\n\n                                 28\n\finference of scienter.” In re Advanta, 180 F.3d at 540 (citations\nand quotation marks omitted). Whether a sale is “unusual in\nscope” depends on factors such as “the amount of profit made,\nthe amount of stock traded, the portion of stockholdings sold, or\nthe number of insiders involved.” Wilson v. Bernstock, 195 F.\nSupp. 2d 619, 635 (D.N.J. 2002) (citation omitted). Other\nfactors relevant to scope and timing are whether the sales were\n“normal and routine,” and whether the profits were substantial\nrelative to the seller’s ordinary compensation. In re Burlington\nCoat Factory, 114 F.3d at 1423.\n\n       The second amended complaints differ as to precisely\nhow many shares Cocchiola sold in the 2001 Offering. Lead\nClass Plaintiff alleges that Cocchiola sold 31% of his total\nholdings (193,423 shares) for proceeds of just over $2 million,\nand that he sold another 81,577 shares in the over-allotment, for\nnearly $1 million in further proceeds.9 SSF Plaintiffs allege that\nCocchiola sold 347,809 shares for proceeds of over $4 million.\nThey further allege that Cocchiola pledged another 200,000\nshares as collateral for a $600,000 personal loan. Both plaintiffs\nagree that Venechanos sold 38% of his total holdings (52,937\nshares) in the 2001 Offering for proceeds of nearly $628,000.\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that these insider sales were suspicious in\ntiming because they came at a time when the price of Suprema’s\nstock was artificially inflated as a result of the round-trip sales\nscheme, just six weeks before Venechanos and Christensen\nresigned. Furthermore, they allege that the sales were suspicious\nin scope because Cocchiola had sold only 50,000 shares before\nthe 2001 Offering and Venechanos had sold none. Cocchiola\nsold over five times the number of shares in the 2001 Offering\nthan he had sold prior to that time. With respect to the ratio of\n\n\n       9\n        According to Lead Class Plaintiff, Cocchiola was the\nlargest holder of Suprema common stock when Suprema filed its\n2001 Form 10-K statement, exercising ownership or control over\n1.1 million shares representing approximately 17.4% of the stock\nissued and outstanding. Venechanos at that time allegedly\nexercised ownership or control over 138,000 shares, or\napproximately 2.4% of the common stock.\n\n                                29\n\fprofits to compensation, SSF Plaintiffs allege that Cocchiola’s\nprofits from the stock sale nearly doubled in one day the total\namount of money that he had made over the previous three years\ncombined. The sales Venechanos made netted him over four\ntimes his annual salary.\n\n        Citing our decision in In re Advanta, 180 F.3d 525, the\nDistrict Court held that the sales made in the 2001 Offering were\nnot unusual because “both Cocchiola and Venechanos retained\nlarge stock holdings after the sales, 49% and 62%, respectively.”\nApp. at 27-28. We conclude, however, that the stock sales here\ndiffer substantially from the sales in In re Advanta. In that case,\nthe defendants traded only small percentages of their holdings,\nwith two of the defendants selling seven and five percent,\nrespectively. In re Advanta, 180 F.3d at 540. Here, each Officer\nis alleged to have sold over 30 percent of his holdings. Plaintiffs\nhave plausibly alleged that the sales were not normal or routine\nfor these Officers, and that the profits from the trades were\nsubstantial in comparison to their overall compensation. Indeed,\nLead Class Plaintiff alleges that Cocchiola realized over $2.3\nmillion in profit from the sale of his shares, and Venechanos\n$627,832. The timing of the sales was also suspect in that they\noccurred just six weeks before Venechanos and Christensen\nresigned. We conclude that plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the\nstock sales are sufficient at this stage to support a strong\ninference that Cocchiola and Venechanos had a motive and\nopportunity to inflate the value of their stock artificially by\nreporting fictitious sales and by falsely inflating the value of\ntheir inventory in public statements.\n\nb) Circumstantial Evidence of Misconduct\n\n        Plaintiffs alleged numerous facts that they argue\nconstitute strong circumstantial evidence that the Officers knew\nof or recklessly disregarded the falsity of Suprema’s registration\nstatements and prospectuses with respect to reported financial\nperformance. Among other things, plaintiffs cite the following:\nCocchiola and Venechanos were the leaders of a very small\nsenior management team at Suprema which boasted a “hands-\non” relationship with key accounts and customers, App. at 128;\nthree of these key customers pled guilty to fraud charges in\n\n                                30\n\fconnection with the round-trip sales scheme and admitted in\ntheir plea allocutions that they had created false invoices, falsely\nlabeled cheese, and adulterated cheese “at the direction and with\nthe participation of Suprema’s management,” App. at 133;10\nfictitious transactions with these customers constituted “more\nthan two-thirds of the company’s revenue and nearly all of its\ngrowth” during the class period, App. at 187; Cocchiola and\nVenechanos signed millions of dollars in company checks during\nthe class period, payable in large part to entities controlled by\nthese customers; Venechanos controlled all of the bookkeeping\nconnected with these accounts and he and Cocchiola prevented\nSuprema’s accounting staff from having any contact with the\naccounts or with BDO concerning the accounts; Cocchiola and\nVenechanos instructed Suprema employees not to be involved in\nthe hard cheese portion of the business; and Cocchiola prevented\nSuprema employees from having contact with BDO concerning\nthe accounts.\n\n        We thus conclude that plaintiffs’ allegations against the\nOfficers are detailed as to each and are sufficient to give rise to\nthe requisite strong inference that these defendants knew that the\nstatements they made in connection with the 2000 and 2001\nOfferings were materially false and misleading. We reject\ndefendants’ contention that plaintiffs have merely pled “fraud by\ntitle.” On the contrary, plaintiffs have attributed to each of the\nOfficers specific knowledge and conduct. Moreover, even if\nplaintiffs’ allegations with respect to the Officers’ insider stock\nsales were insufficient to support a strong inference that they\nacted with scienter, the allegations concerning the Officers’\nrespective roles in the round-trip sales scheme would be enough\nto survive a motion to dismiss. On this record, we will vacate\nthe District Court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ 10(b) claims against\nthe Officers.\n\n\n       10\n         Lead Class Plaintiff specifically alleged that “Cocchiola,\nVenechanos, and Lauriero (when he was alive) . . . collectively\nconstituted the ‘management’ of Suprema throughout the Class\nPeriod[.]” App. at 135. Further, as counsel for Lead Class Plaintiff\nemphasized at argument before this court, Suprema “was a small\ncompany, this was not IBM[.]” Tr. of Oral Argument at 13.\n\n                                31\n\f2. The Auditor\n\n        The District Court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against\nBDO for failure adequately to allege scienter. The court rejected\nplaintiffs’ allegations that BDO acted recklessly by failing to\ntake numerous steps required by GAAS, and that BDO failed to\nheed “red flags” indicating that something was grossly amiss\nwith Suprema’s accounting. The District Court found that the\n“purported ‘red flags’ were normal aspects of a healthy\nbusiness,”and it credited BDO’s argument that it had a good\nfaith belief that its audits were accurate. App. at 32. The\nDistrict Court added that BDO “was in effect a victim of the\nfraud” and had done all it was required to do. Id. Ultimately,\nthe District Court concluded that “given the information\navailable to BDO at the time of the audit it can not be said that\nBDO did not have an honest belief that the statements made by it\nwere true.” Id.\n\n       When a professional opinion is issued to the investing\npublic by those in a position to know more than the public, there\nis an obligation to disclose data indicating that the opinion may\nbe doubtful. Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 776 (3d Cir.\n1985). When that opinion is\n\n       based on underlying materials which on their face or under the\n       circumstances suggest that they cannot be relied on without\n       further inquiry, then the failure to investigate further may\n       “support[ ] an inference that when [the defendant] expressed\n       the opinion it had no genuine belief that it had the information\n       on which it could predicate that opinion.”\n\nId. (quoting McLean v. Alexander, 559 F.2d 1190, 1198 (3d Cir.\n1979)). A showing that an auditor either lacked a genuine belief\nthat its representations were supported by adequate information\nor engaged in auditing practices so shoddy that they amounted at\nbest to a “pretended audit” has traditionally supported a finding\nof liability, even in the face of assertions of good faith. McLean,\n599 F.2d at 1198. But as our case law makes clear,\n\n       the mere second-guessing of calculations will not suffice;\n       appellants must show that [the auditor]’s judgment– at the\n\n                                   32\n\f       moment exercised– was sufficiently egregious such that a\n       reasonable accountant reviewing the facts and figures should\n       have concluded that [the company]’s financial statements were\n       misstated and that as a result the public was likely to be misled.\n\nIn re IKON, 277 F.3d at 673.\n\n       At the pleading stage, courts have recognized that\nallegations of GAAS violations, coupled with allegations that\nsignificant “red flags” were ignored, can suffice to withstand a\nmotion to dismiss. See, e.g., In re Daou, 411 F.3d at 1016;\nGreebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 203 (1st Cir.\n1999); Malone v. Microdyne Corp., 26 F.3d 471, 479 (4th Cir.\n1994). Such allegations, of course, must be pled with\nparticularity. In re Daou, 411 F.3d at 1016. It is insufficient, for\nexample, for a plaintiff to cite GAAS standards without an\nexplanation of how the defendant knowingly or recklessly\nviolated those standards. In re Westinghouse Sec. Litig., 90 F.3d\n696, 712 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n        Plaintiffs here have alleged that BDO failed to comply\nwith specific GAAS standards, including, among others, the\nrequirement to exercise due care and professional skepticism in\nthe conduct of an audit; the requirement adequately to plan, staff,\nand supervise an audit; the requirement adequately to assess the\nnature of the audited business; and the requirement to recognize\nenumerated risk factors or red flags that may have alerted the\nauditor to the existence of fraud. Moreover, plaintiffs explain in\ndetail in the second amended complaints how BDO’s alleged\nGAAS violations led it to overlook numerous red flags. Thirty\nsuch red flags are cited as having been present in this case,\nincluding the following: (1) Suprema’s 2001 Form 10-K made\nno mention that Suprema was engaged in the purchase and resale\nof bulk cheese from domestic suppliers when even a cursory\nreview of the company’s check register, vendor invoices, and\npurchasing records would have revealed that fully two-thirds of\ncompany revenue for that year was derived from such sales; (2)\nSuprema’s cash flows from operations were negative and grew\ndramatically worse over time, even though Suprema was\nreporting astronomical growth in net sales, gross margin, and net\nearnings, including a 400% increase in hard-cheese revenue\n\n                                33\n\fduring just a two-year period; (3) Suprema posted growth that\nwas radically disproportionate with growth in the cheese\nindustry as a whole; (4) although Suprema was reporting rapid\ngrowth in production, it did not report corresponding increases in\nits labor force and the utilization of its production facilities; (5)\nSuprema restricted BDO’s access to key accounting personnel,\nincluding the accounts receivable and accounts payable\nsupervisors, which represented a material limitation of the scope\nof the audit; (6) all of Suprema’s significant hard-cheese\ncustomers had accounts that were well past due; and (7)\nSuprema had weak internal controls, a fact that BDO essentially\nadmitted in its letter of resignation, and one that should have led\nBDO to investigate further before issuing unqualified audit\nopinions.\n\n        BDO argues some of the proffered red flags, such as late\nor missing invoices, delayed compliance with document\nrequests, and payment of stock options and large bonuses to\nmanagement, are not obvious or strong indicators of fraud.\nHowever, even if we discount these weaker indicators, the much\nstronger indicators noted above remain, and those factors are\nsufficient to raise serious questions about the integrity of the\naudits.\n\n       Indeed, accepting plaintiffs’ allegations as true, the\nevidence of Suprema’s financial foul play was hiding in plain\nsight. Suprema management was a small group, and the\ncompany had only five “customers” that accounted for more than\n80% of its business in 2001. Its largest customer that year,\nTricon, and its largest supplier, Noram, were both owned and\ncontrolled by one individual, Paul Zambas. Even a cursory\ninquiry would have disclosed that the address for Tricon in\nSuprema’s business records was not the same as Tricon’s\naddress available in public records; the address to which\nSuprema sent checks to Noram was a gift shop in a mall; and,\nmost tellingly, checks from Tricon to Suprema came from the\nsame bank account into which Suprema’s checks to Noram were\ndeposited. Similarly, the tens of millions of dollars in checks\nthat Suprema wrote to another supplier, CMM, were also\ndeposited into the same account from which a purported\ncustomer, WCC, wrote checks back to Suprema. The checks\n\n                                 34\n\fwere an obvious and readily available indicator of fraud.\nMoreover, plaintiffs have offered a detailed set of allegations as\nto how BDO violated specific GAAS standards in its audit of\nSuprema, and they have identified numerous substantive\nindicators of fraud that were allegedly ignored altogether in the\nauditing process. “[I]n many cases the most plausible means to\nprevail on a section 10(b) claim against an auditor– without that\never-elusive ‘smoking gun’ document or admission– will be to\nshow how specific and not insignificant accounting violations\ncollectively raise an inference of scienter.” In re IKON, 277\nF.3d at 677 n.26; see also PR Diamonds, Inc. v. Chandler, 364\nF.3d 671, 694 (6th Cir. 2004) (“[W]hen the alleged accounting\nerrors are sufficiently basic and large, their existence, in\ncombination with other factors, may support the requisite\nscienter inference.”) (citation omitted). The accounting\nviolations set forth here surpass an inference of ordinary\nnegligence; they reasonably suggest that BDO either knew of, or\nwillfully turned a blind eye to, the fraud at Suprema.\n\n        We have not overlooked BDO’s protestations that it, too,\nwas a victim of the fraud at Suprema, that the fraud conspirators\nhid information from and lied to BDO about Suprema’s finances,\nand that BDO performed its audits in good faith under the\ncircumstances. We are not suggesting that plaintiffs’ Section\n10(b) claim will necessarily survive a properly supported\nsummary judgment motion after BDO marshals its evidence. At\nthe pleading stage, however, plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit\nof all reasonable inferences based on the detailed and specific\nallegations in their complaints. In the face of the numerous and\nnot insignificant alleged accounting violations, we cannot rule\nout, as a matter of law, a strong and reasonable inference of\nBDO’s scienter. Consequently, we will vacate the District\nCourt’s dismissal of the Section 10(b) claims against BDO.\n\n3. The Outside Directors\n\n       The District Court dismissed SSF Plaintiffs’ Section\n10(b) claim against the Outside Directors, holding that the\nallegations supporting the claim were conclusory and lacking in\n\n\n\n                                35\n\fdetail.11 SSF Plaintiffs premise their allegations of recklessness\nagainst the Outside Directors essentially on the following facts:\n(1) revenue was wrongfully recognized; (2) the Outside\nDirectors had access to Suprema’s business records; and (3) the\nOutside Directors were charged, as members of the audit\ncommittee, with reviewing and monitoring the company’s\nfinancial reporting, external audits, internal control functions,\nand compliance with applicable rules and regulations.\n\n       Significantly, while the SSF Plaintiffs alleged specifically\nwhat the audit committee’s duties were, they did not allege\nwhich duties were violated, by whom they were violated, or how\nthey were violated. Indeed, whereas the allegations concerning\nBDO’s recklessness span more than forty pages of the SSF\nPlaintiffs’ second amended complaint, the corresponding\nallegations against the four Outside Directors are scant,\ncomprising fewer than two pages. Recklessness is pled against\nthe Outside Directors as a group, based on their position, without\nany attempt to link specific individuals to specific instances of\nreckless conduct. We have held that such “catch-all” or\n“blanket” assertions do not satisfy the particularity requirements\nof Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA, and must be disregarded.\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 145.\n\n        A pleading of scienter sufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b) “may\nnot rest on a bare inference that a defendant ‘must have had’\nknowledge of the facts” or “must have known” of the fraud\ngiven his or her position in the company. In re Advanta, 180\nF.3d at 539 (citations omitted). As we have stated,\n“[g]eneralized imputations of knowledge do not suffice,\nregardless of the defendants’ positions within the company.” Id.\n(citation omitted). The allegation that the Outside Directors, qua\ndirectors and members of the audit committee, had access to\nunspecified business records and a duty to review them does not\ngive rise to a strong inference that the Outside Directors\nindividually knew of or recklessly disregarded particular\n\n\n       11\n         As noted, Lead Class Plaintiff did not file a Section 10(b)\nclaim against the Outside Directors, nor did it file such a claim\nagainst the Underwriters.\n\n                                36\n\fwrongful recognitions of revenue. We will, therefore, affirm the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of SSF Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims\nagainst the Outside Directors.\n\n4. The 2000 and 2001 Underwriters\n\n        The District Court also dismissed SSF Plaintiffs’ Section\n10(b) claim against the Underwriters, holding that the allegations\nsuggested negligence only and did not reach the threshold for\nscienter. In the second amended complaint, SSF Plaintiffs\nalleged that the Underwriters collectively “failed to adequately\nreview Suprema’s internal financial forecasts, contracts, and\nother documents, make a physical inspection of Suprema’s major\nfacilities, employ analysts having expertise in the cheese\nbusiness, conduct interviews with Suprema’s senior and middle\nmanagement, or interview Suprema’s major customers, outside\nquality consultants, auditors, and legal counsel.” App. at 381-\n82. SSF Plaintiffs also alleged that the Underwriters earned\nsignificant fees for services rendered in connection with the\npublic offerings.\n\n        “A securities professional has an obligation to investigate\nthe securities he or she offers to customers.” SEC v. GLT Dain\nRauscher, Inc., 254 F.3d 852, 857 (9th Cir. 2001). The\ninvestigation must be adequate to provide the professional “with\na reasonable basis for a belief that the key representations in the\nstatements provided to . . . investors [a]re truthful and complete.”\nId. at 858 (citations omitted). Whereas a reckless failure to\ninvestigate an issuer of securities can give rise to liability under\nSection 10(b), simple negligence, even inexcusable negligence,\nis not enough. Infinity, 212 F.3d at 192. Nor is an allegation\nthat an underwriter had a motive to commit fraud simply because\nit stood to collect underwriting fees. GSC, 368 F.3d at 238.\n\n       Our review of the SSF Plaintiffs’ allegations confirms the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that they failed adequately to allege\nscienter. The breaches alleged are, at best, negligent breaches of\nthe duty to investigate. The fact that the Underwriters earned\nfees for their services does not establish that they acted with any\nculpable intent. Moreover, plaintiffs’ manner of pleading their\nclaim collectively, through blanket allegations against numerous\n\n                                37\n\fdifferent defendants, runs afoul of the particularity requirements\nof the PSLRA and Rule 9(b). See CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 145.\nPlaintiffs accuse all of the Underwriters of having breached\nvarious aspects of the duty to investigate, but they fail to allege\nany specific derogation of duty on the part of any specific\ndefendant. Given the lack of particularity in their pleading, and\ngiven that they have alleged a mental state amounting to no more\nthan negligence, SSF Plaintiffs have failed to state a Section\n10(b) claim. We will affirm the dismissal of the Section 10(b)\nclaim against the Underwriters.\n\nC. Section 18 Claims\n\n        SSF Plaintiffs asserted a claim for relief under Section 18\nof the Exchange Act against the Officers, Outside Directors, and\nBDO for their alleged negligence in connection with the false\nstatements purportedly made in documents that Suprema filed\nwith the SEC. Section 18 creates a private remedy for damages\nresulting from the purchase or sale of a security in reliance upon\na false or misleading statement contained in any document or\nreport filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.\n15 U.S.C. § 78r(a).12 SSF Plaintiffs concede that to state their\n\n\n       12\n            Section 78r(a) provides in relevant part:\n\n                Any person who shall make or cause\n                to be made any statement in any\n                application, report, or document filed\n                pursuant to this chapter or any rule or\n                regulation thereunder or any\n                undertaking contained in a registration\n                statement as provided in subsection\n                (d) of section 78o of this title, which\n                statement was at the time and in the\n                light of the circumstances under which\n                it was made false or misleading with\n                respect to any material fact, shall be\n                liable to any person (not knowing that\n                such statement was false or\n                misleading) who, in reliance upon\n\n                                   38\n\fclaim under Section 18, they were required to plead actual, as\nopposed to presumed, reliance upon a false or misleading\nstatement. See SSF Br. at 44 (citing Heit v. Weitzen, 402 F.2d\n909, 916 (2d Cir. 1968)); see also Howard v. Everex Sys., 228\nF.3d 1057, 1063 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that “courts have\nrequired a purchaser’s actual reliance on the fraudulent statement\nunder § 18(a), as opposed to the constructive reliance, or\nfraud-on-the-market, theory available under § 10(b)”) (citation\nomitted). A Section 18 plaintiff, however, bears no burden of\nproving that the defendant acted with scienter or any particular\nstate of mind. In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig., 414 F.3d\n187, 193 (1st Cir. 2005); see Magna Inv. Corp. v. John Does\nOne Through Two Hundred, 931 F.2d 38, 39-40 (11th Cir.\n1991). Thus, unlike a Section 10(b) claim, liability under\nSection 18 requires proof of reliance but does not require proof\nof scienter. See McGann v. Ernst & Young, 102 F.3d 390, 395\n(9th Cir. 1996).13\n\n       SSF Plaintiffs contend that they sufficiently pled actual\nreliance under Section 18 because they alleged that they read and\nrelied upon each “document” that contained a misstatement or\nomission. The District Court determined that, although SSF\nPlaintiffs stated for each document at issue that they “relied\nupon” the document, they “merely allege[d] that they relied [on\nthe] documents that contained misstatements. They did not\n\n\n\n              such statement, shall have purchased\n              or sold a security at a price which was\n              affected by such statement, for\n              damages caused by such reliance,\n              unless the person sued shall prove that\n              he acted in good faith and had no\n              knowledge that such statement was\n              false or misleading.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78r(a).\n       13\n         This court has yet to determine when or if the heightened\npleading requirements of Rule 9(b) apply to a Section 18 claim, but\nwe see no need to reach that question on this appeal.\n\n                                39\n\fallege actual reliance on the specific misrepresentations\nthemselves.” App. at 35. The District Court held that, absent\nallegations of reliance on specific statements, the claims were\ninadequately pled.\n\n        We agree that plaintiffs were required to plead actual\nreliance on specific statements contained in the SEC filings at\nissue. Section 18 plainly refers to reliance upon any materially\nfalse “statement.” See 15 U.S.C. § 78r(a) (“Any person who\nshall make . . . any statement in any application, report, or\ndocument[,] . . . which statement was [materially false,] . . . shall\nbe liable to any person . . . who, in reliance upon such statement,\nshall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was\naffected by such statement.”) (emphasis added). In Cramer v.\nGeneral Tel. & Electronics Corp., 582 F.2d 259 (3d Cir. 1978),\nthis court, applying this natural reading of the statutory\nlanguage, stated that a plaintiff seeking to bring a claim under\nSection 18 must allege a causal nexus between the sale of a\nsecurity and “reliance upon a false statement” in a report filed\nwith the SEC. Id. at 269 (emphasis added).\n\n        SSF Plaintiffs alleged cursorily that they “received,\nreviewed, actually read, and relied upon” various Form 10-Q\nfilings and the 2000 and 2001 Form 10-K filings. For example,\nregarding the September 28, 2001, Form 10-K, they allege that\nthey “obtained this document at or about the it [sic] was publicly\nfiled with the SEC, and actually read and relied upon it in\nmaking their decisions to invest in Suprema common stock.”\nApp. at 367. SSF Plaintiffs failed, however, to plead facts\nprobative of their actual reliance on any specific false statements\ncontained in those filings. Given the lack of allegations to show\nthe requisite causal nexus between their purchase of securities\nand specific statements contained in the SEC filings, we will\naffirm the District Court’s dismissal of SSF Plaintiffs’ Section\n18 claims.\n\nD. Section 15 and Section 20(a) Claims\n\n       Section 15 of the Securities Act provides for joint and\nseveral liability on the part of one who controls a violator of\nSection 11 or Section 12. 15 U.S.C. § 77o; see In re Adams\n\n                                 40\n\fGolf, 381 F.3d at 273 n. 3.14 Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act\nimposes joint and several liability upon one who controls a\nviolator of Section 10(b). 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a); see In re Alpharma\nInc. Sec. Litig., 372 F.3d 137, 153 (3d Cir. 2004); Sharp v.\nCoopers & Lybrand, 649 F.2d 175, 185 (3d Cir. 1981).15 Under\n\n\n      14\n           Section 15 provides:\n\n               Every person who, by or through stock\n               ownership, agency, or otherwise, or\n               who, pursuant to or in connection with\n               an agreement or understanding with\n               one or more other persons by or\n               through stock ownership, agency, or\n               otherwise, controls any person liable\n               under sections 77k or 77l of this title,\n               shall also be liable jointly and\n               severally with and to the same extent\n               as such controlled person to any\n               person to whom such controlled\n               person is liable, unless the controlling\n               person had no knowledge of or\n               reasonable ground to believe in the\n               existence of the facts by reason of\n               which the liability of the controlled\n               person is alleged to exist.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 77o.\n      15\n        Section 20(a) provides:\n\n               Every person who, directly or\n               indirectly, controls any person liable\n               under any provision of this chapter or\n               of any rule or regulation thereunder\n               shall also be liable jointly and\n               severally with and to the same extent\n               as such controlled person to any\n               person to whom such controlled\n               person is liable, unless the controlling\n\n                                  41\n\fboth provisions, the plaintiff must prove that one person\ncontrolled another person or entity and that the controlled person\nor entity committed a primary violation of the securities laws.\nSee Klein v. Gen. Nutrition Companies, 186 F.3d 338, 344 (3d\nCir. 1999) (Section 15); In re Alpharma, 372 F.3d at 153\n(Section 20(a)).16\n\n       Both plaintiffs asserted Section 15 and Section 20(a)\nclaims against the Officers, i.e., Cocchiola and Venechanos. The\nDistrict Court dismissed these claims on the ground that the\nOfficers’ underlying violations of the securities laws were\ninadequately pled, and thus the control-person claims must fail,\nas well. We have concluded, however, that plaintiffs did\nadequately plead their Section 11, Section 12(a)(2), and Section\n10(b) claims against the Officers.\n\n       Plaintiffs contend, moreover, that the District Court\nmisconstrued the nature of their control-person claims. They\nnote that their Section 15 and Section 20(a) counts were\npremised upon underlying violations by Suprema itself, even\nthough Suprema is not named as a defendant because it is\nbankrupt. Plaintiffs contend that while the Officers were alleged\nto have committed primary violations in other counts of the\nsecond amended complaints, Suprema was the alleged primary\nviolator for purposes of the control-person claims.\n\n\n\n\n              person acted in good faith and did not\n              directly or indirectly induce the act or\n              acts constituting the violation or cause\n              of action.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).\n       16\n         We also have held that “secondary liability cannot be\nfound under Section 20(a) unless it can be shown that the\ndefendant was a culpable participant in the fraud.” Rochez Bros.,\nInc. v. Rhoades, 527 F.2d 880, 890 (3d Cir. 1975); see also Sharp,\n649 F.2d at 185 (“One element of any case imposing liability under\n§ 20(a) is ‘culpable participation’ in the securities violation.”).\n\n                                42\n\f       The record reveals that plaintiffs did expressly name the\ncorporation itself as the primary violator in their Section 15 and\nSection 20(a) counts. Both plaintiffs also asserted that they\nwould have named Suprema as a defendant to the suits were it\nnot for its status as a bankrupt. Essentially, plaintiffs argue that\nSuprema’s controlling persons should not escape liability under\nSection 15 and Section 20(a) merely because Suprema’s\nunderlying liability cannot be formally adjudicated due to its\ninsolvency. We agree.\n\n       As noted, Section 15 imposes joint and several liability\nfor any person who controls a person liable under the Securities\nAct, while Section 20(a) imposes similar control liability for an\nunderlying violator of the Exchange Act. With regard to Section\n20(a), we have observed that “[t]he text of the statute plainly\nrequires the plaintiff to prove not only that one person controlled\nanother person, but also that the ‘controlled person’ is liable\nunder the Act. If no controlled person is liable, there can be no\ncontrolling person liability.” Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 279 (citation\nomitted). The same holds true for claims brought under Section\n15. See, e.g., Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 52\n(1st Cir. 1999). Thus, establishing the liability of the controlled\nperson or entity is plainly an element of a claim for relief under\nboth Section 15 and Section 20(a).\n\n        But there is no requirement in the language of either\nstatute that the controlled person be named as a defendant as a\npredicate to imposing liability upon the controlling individual\ndefendants. A plaintiff need only establish the controlled\nperson’s liability. See In re Hayes Lemmerz Intern., Inc., 271 F.\nSupp. 2d 1007, 1022 n. 11 (E.D. Mich. 2003) (“[I]f the\ncomplaint states a primary violation by the Company, even if the\nCompany is not named in the complaint as a defendant, then a §\n20 claim can stand if the individuals were controlling persons.”);\nIn re CitiSource, Inc. Sec. Litig., 694 F. Supp. 1069, 1077\n(S.D.N.Y. 1988) (holding that “liability of the primary violator is\nsimply an element of proof of a section 20(a) claim,” and that\n“liability need not be actually visited upon the primary violator\nbefore a controlling person may be held liable for the primary\nviolator’s wrong”). As one district court has cogently observed,\n“it would be inconsistent with the broad remedial purposes of the\n\n                                 43\n\fsecurities laws to permit senior executives of a bankrupt\ncorporation– whose actions allegedly contributed to the\nbankruptcy– to avoid liability by relying on the corporation’s\nbankruptcy.” Schleicher v. Wendt, No. 1:02CV1332DFHTAB,\n2005 WL 1656871, at *6 (S.D. Ind. July 14, 2005).\n\n        Plaintiffs here adequately alleged primary violations of\nthe Securities Act and the Exchange Act by Suprema. Lead\nClass Plaintiff set forth in detail the specific allegations of\nSuprema’s misstatements and omissions in its Registration\nStatement and Prospectus, and it expressly asserted that Suprema\nshould be primarily liable as a result under Section 15. Lead\nClass Plaintiff also detailed the allegations of materially false\nand misleading statements and omissions in SEC filings and\nasserted that Suprema should be held primarily liable under\nSection 20(a). SSF Plaintiffs set forth similar and equally\nsufficient allegations. The complaints also detailed the manner\nin which Cocchiola and Venechanos are alleged to have tightly\ncontrolled Suprema’s business and operations and acted as\nculpable participants in the fraud, as discussed in connection\nwith plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims against those defendants.\nFor these reasons, we will vacate the dismissal of plaintiffs’\nSection 15 and Section 20(a) claims against the Officers.17\n\nE. Pendent State law claims\n\n       After dismissing all claims brought under federal law, the\n\n\n       17\n         SSF Plaintiffs also asserted Section 15 and Section 20(a)\nclaims against the Outside Directors. In their opening brief,\nhowever, SSF Plaintiffs devote a mere one paragraph to their\ncontrol-person claims, and that paragraph makes no mention of the\nOutside Directors per se and provides no substantive discussion of\nthe claims against those defendants. Although SSF Plaintiffs argue\nthe claim at length in their reply brief, it is well-settled in this court\nthat “an appellant's failure to identify or argue an issue in his\nopening brief constitutes waiver of that issue on appeal.” United\nStates v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 222 (3d Cir. 2005). Consequently,\nwe deem SSF Plaintiffs’ control-person claims against the Outside\nDirectors waived.\n\n                                   44\n\fDistrict Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) over the SSF Plaintiffs’ state-law\nclaims based on common law fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation. The District Court did not address the merits\nof the state law claims. Given our conclusion that many of the\nfederal claims were improperly dismissed at this preliminary\nstage, and that the District Court therefore retains jurisdiction\nover the federal claims, we will vacate the dismissal of the state-\nlaw claims for reconsideration by the District Court.\n\n                                III.\n\n        We will affirm the District Court’s dismissal of both\nplaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims against the Outside Directors and\nthe Underwriters, as well as the dismissal of the Section 18\nclaims in their entirety. We will reverse the dismissal of\nplaintiffs’ Section 11 and 12(a)(2) claims against all defendants,\nthe Section 10(b) claims against the Officers and BDO, the\nSection 15 and 20(a) claims as to the Officers, and the dismissal\nof the SSF Plaintiffs’ claims under state law. We will remand\nthe matter to the District Court for further proceedings on the\nremaining claims in accordance with this opinion.\n____________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                45\n\f",

Conclusion\n\n\n       At the center of this securities fraud action is Suprema\nSpecialties, Inc. (“Suprema”), a now-defunct company that\npresented itself as a producer and distributor of all natural\ngourmet Italian cheeses. Over a two-year period, Suprema\n\n                                4\n\freported wildly successful growth in its sales and receivables,\nthereby enticing lenders to increase its credit line and luring\ninvestors to the purchase of its stock. In truth, Suprema had\nfabricated millions of dollars in cheese sales and engaged in\nother fraudulent schemes that ultimately led to the company’s\ndissolution in bankruptcy. Government investigations resulted\nin four individuals connected to Suprema’s schemes pleading\nguilty to federal charges of, inter alia, conspiracy to commit\nsecurities fraud. Those individuals have admitted that a number\nof Suprema’s public statements regarding its finances and the\nnature of its business were untrue.\n\n        The plaintiffs-appellants here are two institutional\ninvestors, Special Situations Fund, III, L.P., and Special\nSituations Fund Cayman, L.P. (collectively, the “SSF\nPlaintiffs”), and the Teachers’ Retirement System of Louisiana\n(referred to as “Lead Class Plaintiff” because it held that status\nin the consolidated class actions before the District Court). SSF\nPlaintiffs and Lead Class Plaintiff brought separate actions for\ndamages against Suprema’s former officers and directors, its\nauditor, and several investment firms that served as underwriters\nin two public stock offerings through which plaintiffs claim to\nhave acquired Suprema stock. Plaintiffs asserted claims for\nrelief under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of\n1933 (the “Securities Act”), and Sections 10(b), 18, and 20 of\nthe Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”),\nalong with fraud and misrepresentation claims under state law.\nOn defendants’ motions, the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of New Jersey dismissed all claims pursuant to Rules\n9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as\nwell as provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct (“PSLRA”). Among the important issues presented on\nappeal is whether the District Court properly applied the “sounds\nin fraud” doctrine in dismissing the claims asserted under\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) despite plaintiffs’ efforts to\nground their Securities Act claims in negligence and to plead\nthem separately in the complaints from their fraud-based claims.\nWe will reverse the District Court’s orders dismissing the claims\nunder Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act and\nSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act as to some of the defendants,\nand we will affirm as to the dismissal of the remaining counts.\n\n                                 5\n\fWe will remand as to the state law claims.\n\n                                 I.\n\n       In setting forth the underlying facts, we accept as true the\nwell-pleaded allegations in plaintiffs’ second amended\ncomplaints and consider the documents incorporated by\nreference therein.

The Rise and Fall of Suprema\n\n       Suprema was founded as a New York non-public\ncorporation in 1983. It became a publicly traded company in\n1991 and was listed on the NASDAQ (trading under the symbol\n“CHEZ”) in 1993. Suprema had its corporate headquarters,\nalong with a processing plant, in Paterson, New Jersey, and it\noperated three wholly-owned subsidiaries, at which it\nmanufactured and processed cheese, in Manteca, California;\nOgdensburg, New York; and Blackfoot, Idaho. Suprema’s\nbusiness was divided between two product lines: “hard cheese,”\nwhich included imported and domestically produced parmesan\nand romano, and “soft-cheese,” which included domestically\nproduced mozzarella, ricotta, and provolone.\n\n        Defendant-Appellee Mark Cocchiola was a founder of\nSuprema and acted as the company’s Executive Vice-President,\nCEO, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Defendant-\nAppellee Steven Venechanos was the company’s CFO and\nSecretary, and also a member of the Board of Directors during\nthe Class Period. (Cocchiola and Venechanos will be referred to\ncollectively as the “Officers.”) Defendants-Appellees Marco\nCocchiola (Mark Cocchiola’s father), Rudolph Acosta, Jr., Paul\nDeSocio, and Barry Rutcofsky (collectively, the “Outside\nDirectors”) were members of the Board of Directors. (We will\nrefer to Mark Cocchiola simply as “Cocchiola” and to Marco\nCocchiola by his full name.) Marco Cocchiola was also\nSuprema’s Operations Manager. Acosta, DeSocio, and\nRutcofsky were members of the Board’s Audit Committee.\nDefendant-Appellee BDO Seidman, LLP (“BDO”) was\n\n                                 6\n\fSuprema’s auditor throughout the class period.\n\n        In 2000 and 2001, Suprema reported dramatic growth in\nsales and receivables, which it attributed primarily to growth in\nsales of its domestically manufactured hard cheeses. Suprema’s\nnet sales for fiscal year 2000 increased to $278.4 million,\nreflecting a 58% increase over fiscal year 1999, and for fiscal\nyear 2001, increased to $420.3 million, or 51% over fiscal year\n2000. In its hard cheese business alone, Suprema reported 400%\ngrowth in revenue between fiscal year 1999 and the end of fiscal\nyear 2001. Its receivables were reported to have grown from\n$36 million at the end of fiscal year 1999 to $101.8 million by\nthe end of fiscal year 2001. During this same period, industry-\nwide growth in sales was only approximately 9% per year. In\nSeptember 2001, FORTUNE MAGAZINE named Suprema the\ntwenty-third fastest growing small company in the United States,\nand shortly thereafter FORBES MAGAZINE ranked it as the\ntwenty-second best small company. Between the fourth quarter\nof 1998 and the fourth quarter of 2000, the company’s average\nshare price more than doubled.\n\n        State and federal investigations subsequently revealed\nthat Suprema’s explosive growth was an illusion– the product of\na fraudulent scheme involving so-called round-trip sales or\ncircular transactions associated with the hard cheese side of its\nbusiness. The round-trip sales scheme was one in which\nSuprema purportedly sold hard cheese products to entities posing\nas customers, which then sold the fictitious products to entities\nposing as suppliers. The “suppliers,” in turn, sold the products\nback to Suprema. In most cases, the customer and the supplier\nin these sales shared a common owner who would reap\ncommissions on the fictitious transactions. According to a civil\ncomplaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) in 2004, fictitious sales accounted for approximately\n30%, 65%, 85% and 87% of Suprema’s accounts receivable for\nfiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001.\n\n       Millions of dollars in company checks– some signed by\nCocchiola, some by Venechanos, and some by both– were\nissued to ostensible “suppliers” during 2001. The apparent\nincrease in net sales and accounts receivable brought increases in\n\n                                7\n\fthe company’s line of credit. Suprema’s credit line increased\nfrom $35 million in 1998 to $140 million in 2001. The increased\ncredit line led to an expansion in the volume and value of\nfictitious round-trip sales, which in turn led to further increases\nin accounts receivable, thereby fueling the increased line of\ncredit. The ever-widening cycle produced the appearance, on\npaper, of phenomenal growth.\n\n        The invoices issued in connection with the circular\nscheme generally did not correspond to any actual shipments.\nSome of the “ship to” locations identified in invoices for huge\nquantities of cheese were nothing more than postal boxes,\nstorefronts, or single-family residences. The shipments that\nwere actually made contained mislabeled or adulterated cheese\nproducts that were generally unfit for human consumption.\nSuprema purchased imitation cheeses and other non-cheese\nproducts and relabeled them as higher-priced premium cheeses,\nand it adulterated its “all natural” cheeses with fillers to reduce\ncosts and increase sales. Inventory impounded by the\ngovernment in connection with its investigations turned out to\nhave been grossly overvalued and was actually worth less than\n$2 million, though Suprema had represented it in December\n2001 as worth more than $60 million.\n\n        On December 21, 2001, just six weeks after Suprema\nconducted a substantial public stock offering (discussed below),\nVenechanos and Suprema’s controller, Arthur Christensen,\nresigned, and the company announced that it had initiated an\ninternal investigation into its previously reported financial\nresults. In response to this announcement, NASDAQ suspended\ntrading of Suprema’s stock. On January 25, 2002, the company\nannounced that it had engaged Deloitte & Touche, LLP to\ncontinue the investigation.\n\n       From that point, Suprema and the fraudulent scheme upon\nwhich its apparent success had been founded unraveled quickly.\nOn February 4, 2002, federal authorities executed a search\nwarrant at Suprema’s headquarters and seized financial and\nmanufacturing records. Thereafter, Suprema revealed that it was\nbeing criminally investigated by the FBI, the FDA, the SEC, and\nthe New Jersey Department of Agriculture. On February 18,\n\n                                 8\n\f2002, BDO resigned as Suprema’s auditor, citing, among other\nreasons, an inability to determine whether the company had\nadequate internal controls necessary to develop reliable financial\nstatements, whether Suprema’s prior financial statements\ncontained material inaccuracies, and whether it could rely on\nmanagement’s representations.\n\n        On February 24, 2002, Suprema filed for Chapter 11\nbankruptcy protection. On the same day, it announced that\nCocchiola had resigned as CEO and that NASDAQ would be de-\nlisting its stock as of March 1, 2002. On March 20, 2002, the\ncompany’s Chapter 11 reorganization was converted into a\nChapter 7 liquidation, and a liquidation trustee was appointed.\n\n        On January 7, 2004, four individuals associated with the\ncompany– the former Operations Manager of the Paterson plant,\nJohn Van Sickell,1 and the principals of three companies that had\nbeen Suprema’s ostensible customers or suppliers, Lawrence\nFransen, George Vieira, and Robert Quattrone– pled guilty to\nfederal charges of, inter alia, conspiracy to commit securities\nfraud, bank fraud, and mail fraud in connection with the round-\ntrip sales scheme. In their plea allocutions, all four individuals\nadmitted that their criminal actions, including participation in the\ninvoicing scheme and adulteration of products, were undertaken\nat the direction and under the supervision of, or with the\nknowledge of and in conjunction with, Suprema’s management.\nThe criminal informations filed by the United States Attorney in\nthe case alleged that $700 million of Suprema’s $1.2 billion in\nnet sales between 1996 and 2002 (87% of all sales made to the\ncompanies controlled by Fransen, Vieira, and Quattrone) were\nentirely fictitious.2\n\n\n       1\n        Van Sickell had worked as an assistant to the company’s\nformer Executive Vice-President, Paul Lauriero, who died in\nAugust 2001. Following Lauriero’s death, Cocchiola assumed his\nresponsibilities, which included overseeing the company’s general\noperations and its procurement of raw materials for production.\n       2\n       At the time the District Court decided the motions to\ndismiss, neither Cocchiola nor Venechanos was under indictment.\n\n                                 9\n\fB. The Secondary Offerings\n\n        Suprema conducted two public stock offerings relevant to\nthis action: the first was in August 2000 (the “2000 Offering”),\nand the second was in November 2001 (the “2001 Offering”).\nThe 2000 Offering was for 1.2 million shares of common stock.\nIt was underwritten by, inter alia, defendants-appellees\nOberweis.net; Paulson Investment Co.; Westminster Securities\nCorp.; and Westport Resources (collectively, the “2000\nUnderwriters”).3 On May 10, 2000, Suprema filed a registration\nstatement and prospectus on Form S-2 with the SEC announcing\nthe offering. Cocchiola, Venechanos, Marco Cocchiola, Acosta,\nand DeSocio signed the Form S-2. The Form S-2 incorporated\nby reference Suprema’s annual report on Form 10-K filed on\nJune 30, 1999, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed on\nSeptember 30 and December 31, 1999, and its proxy statement\n\n\n\nPursuant to a motion to expand the record on appeal, which we\ngranted, SSF Plaintiffs submitted a Supplemental Appendix\ncontaining a 38-count grand jury indictment of those individuals in\nconnection with their activities at Suprema. The indictment, which\nwas brought in the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey, charges Cocchiola and Venechanos with, inter alia,\nconspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and making false\nstatements to the SEC. Because the indictments of Cocchiola and\nVenechanos were not part of the record below, we do not consider\nthem for purposes of this appeal.\n       3\n         The 2000 Offering was also underwritten by Hobbs\nMelville Securities Corp.; Auerbach, Pollak & Richardson, Inc.;\nGirard Securities, Inc.; and Mercer Partners, Inc. These four\ncompanies were named as defendants by the SSF Plaintiffs but\nnever entered appearances in the action. There is no indication on\nthe district court docket that the SSF Plaintiffs served process upon\nthem. Counsel for SSF Plaintiffs suggested at oral argument before\nthis court that “some” of these defendants “are being represented\nby Oberweis.net,” but we find no indication that this is the case.\nTr. Oral Arg. at 55. Given the SSF Plaintiffs’ failure to brief any\nissue concerning the non-appearance of these underwriters, we\nconclude that any claims against them are not properly before us.\n\n                                 10\n\ffiled on October 22, 1999.\n\n       The 2001 Offering was for 4.05 million shares of\ncommon stock. It was underwritten by defendants-appellees\nJanney Montgomery Scott, LLC; Pacific Growth Equities, Inc.;\nand Roth Capital Partners, LLC (collectively, the “2001\nUnderwriters”). Cocchiola, Venechanos, Marco Cocchiola,\nAcosta, DeSocio, and Rutcofsky signed the Form S-2 filed with\nthe SEC in connection with the offering. The Form S-2\nincorporated by reference Suprema’s annual report on Form 10-\nK filed on September 28, 2001. By the close of the 2001\nOffering, Suprema had sold 3.5 million shares for proceeds of\n$41.5 million.\n\n        BDO issued unqualified audit opinions in August 1999\nand August 2001 regarding Suprema’s consolidated financial\nstatements for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001. The audit\nopinions were incorporated into the Form S-2s that Suprema\nfiled for the 2000 and 2001 Offerings. BDO stated that it had\nperformed its audits in accordance with Generally Accepted\nAuditing Standards (“GAAS”)4 and that, in its opinion,\n        the consolidated financial statements … present\n        fairly, in all material respects, the financial\n        position of [Suprema and its wholly owned\n        subsidiaries] as of June 30, 2000 and 2001, and the\n        results of their operations and their cash flows for\n        each of the three years in the period ended June 30,\n        2001, in conformity with generally accepted\n        accounting principles.\n\nApp. at 195, 903.\n\n      SSF Plaintiffs allege that they purchased 250,000 shares\nof Suprema common stock in the 2000 Offering at a price of\n\n\n      4\n       GAAS are the standards established by the Auditing\nStandards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for the conduct of auditors performing an\nexamination.

In its order, the District Court afforded plaintiffs leave to\nfile a motion to amend the complaints to cure, if possible, what it\nidentified as the defects in plaintiffs’ pleading of the claims.\nPlaintiffs so moved, and defendants opposed the motion.\n\n     On the day scheduled for oral argument on the motion to\namend, January 8, 2004, counsel for Lead Class Plaintiff\n\n                                 12\n\finformed the District Court that Van Sickell, Fransen, Vieira,\nand Quattrone had entered their guilty pleas on the previous day.\nIn view of this new information, the parties agreed that plaintiffs\nshould be granted leave to file second amended complaints in\nwhich they could incorporate newly discovered facts arising out\nof the criminal informations and guilty pleas. Accordingly,\nplaintiffs filed their respective second amended complaints on\nJanuary 30, 2004.\n\n       Lead Class Plaintiff’s second amended complaint asserted\nviolations of Section 11 of the Securities Act by all defendants;\nSection 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act by the Officers and 2001\nUnderwriters; Section 15 of the Securities Act by the Officers;\nSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act by the Officers and BDO;\nand Section 20 of the Exchange Act by the Officers. Lead Class\nPlaintiff brought suit on its own behalf and on behalf of all those\nwho acquired Suprema common stock in the 2001 Offering\npursuant to the registration statement, or acquired Suprema\ncommon stock during the class period of September 27, 2000\nthrough December 21, 2001, and sustained a loss as a result.\n\n       SSF Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint asserted\nviolations of the following provisions: Section 11 by all\ndefendants; Section 12(a)(2) by the Officers and (non-appearing\ndefendant) Hobbs Melville; Section 15 by the Officers and the\nOutside Directors; Section 18 of the Exchange Act by the\nOfficers, the Outside Directors, and BDO; Section 10(b) by all\ndefendants; Section 20 by the Officers and the Outside\nDirectors; and common law fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation by all defendants.\n\n        Although plaintiffs added a host of new allegations\narising out of the Suprema criminal investigations and\nindictments, all defendants again moved to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim. The District Court granted the motions and\ndismissed the second amended complaints in their entirety.

The District\nCourt dismissed plaintiffs’ Section 11 and 12(a)(2) claims on the\nground that those claims “sounded in fraud” and failed to satisfy\nthe heightened pleading requirement of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 9(b) for averments of fraud. The District Court\n\n                                13\n\fdismissed plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims for failure adequately\nto plead scienter; it dismissed SSF Plaintiffs’ Section 18 claims\nfor failure adequately to plead actual reliance on alleged material\nmisstatements; and it dismissed plaintiffs’ Section 15 and\nSection 20(a) control-person claims for failure adequately to\nplead underlying violations by the Officers. The District Court\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the SSF\nPlaintiffs’ state law claims.\n\n       Plaintiffs each timely filed a notice of appeal from the\ndismissal of their respective second amended complaints. This\ncourt consolidated the appeals for disposition. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the grant of\na motion to dismiss is de novo. In re NAHC Sec.

As relevant here, Section 11 concerns material\nmisstatements or omissions in registration statements, while\n\n                                 14\n\fsection 12(a)(2) concerns material misrepresentations in\nprospectuses and other solicitation materials. Adams, 381 F.3d\nat 273.\n\n        Under Section 11, “a private action for damages may be\nbrought ‘by any person acquiring such security’ if a registration\nstatement, as of its effective date: (1) ‘contained an untrue\nstatement of material fact’; (2) ‘omitted to state a material fact\nrequired to be stated therein’; or (3) omitted to state a material\nfact ‘necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.’”\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 167 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 77k(a)).

A\nSection 11 claim may be brought against the issuer of securities,\nits directors or partners, underwriters, and accountants who\nprepared or certified the registration statement. Id. at 382 n.13\n(citing § 77k(a)). Section 11 is a “virtually absolute liability\nprovision[ ], which do[es] not require plaintiffs to allege that\ndefendants possessed any scienter.” In re Adams Golf, 381 F.3d\nat 274 n.7. “If a plaintiff purchased a security issued pursuant to\na registration statement, he need only show a material\nmisstatement or omission to establish his prima facie case.”\nHerman & MacLean, 459 U.S. at 382.\n\n        Section 12(a)(2) provides for civil liability for anyone\nwho offers or sells a security “by means of a prospectus or oral\ncommunication, which includes an untrue statement of material\nfact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make\nthe statements, in light of the circumstances under which they\nwere made, not misleading. . . .” 15 U.S.C. § 77l(a)(2). Like\nSection 11, Section 12(a)(2) is a “virtually absolute” liability\nprovision that does not require an allegation that defendants\npossessed scienter. In re Adams Golf, 381 F.3d at 274 n.7. To\nstate a prima facie claim under Section 12(a)(2), the plaintiff\nmust allege the purchase of securities pursuant to a materially\nfalse or misleading prospectus or oral communication. Id. at\n273.\n\n\n                                15\n\f       Fraud, as noted above, is not a necessary element to\nestablish a prima facie claim under Section 11 or Section\n12(a)(2). See Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 288. But claims under those\nprovisions can be, and often are, predicated on allegations of\nfraud. See, e.g., CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 160. We have held that\nwhere the plaintiff grounds these Securities Act claims in\nallegations of fraud – and the claims thus “sound in fraud”– the\nheightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) apply. Id. at 161-\n63; Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 288-89.5 SSF Plaintiffs urge us “to do\naway with the ‘sounds in fraud’ doctrine altogether,” SSF Br. at\n19, but this panel is bound by prior precedential decisions of this\ncourt. See 3d Cir. IOP Ch. 9.1.\n\n       Rule 9(b) provides that “[i]n all averments of fraud or\nmistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be\nstated with particularity.” Rule 9(b) serves to give defendants\n“notice of the claims against them, provide[ ] an increased\nmeasure of protection for their reputations, and reduce[ ] the\nnumber of frivolous suits brought solely to extract settlements.”\nIn re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741725\"><a href=\"/opinion/741725/in-re-burlington-coat-factory-securities-litigation-p-gregory-buchanan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1410</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1418\n(3d Cir. 1997). “Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to plead (1) a\nspecific false representation of material fact; (2) knowledge by\nthe person who made it of its falsity; (3) ignorance of its falsity\nby the person to whom it was made; (4) the intention that it\n\n\n       5\n         Plaintiffs argue that applying Rule 9(b) to Section 11 and\nSection 12(a)(2) claims impermissibly “create[s] new elements for\nthese statutory causes of action.” LP Br. at 24; accord SSF Br. at\n26. We have previously rejected this argument:\n\n       It does not logically flow from the fact that fraud is\n       not a necessary element of a section 11 claim that a\n       section 11 claim cannot hinge on an allegation of\n       fraud. . . . Recognizing that neither fraud nor mistake\n       is a necessary element of a cause of action under\n       section 11, we nonetheless held in Shapiro that\n       ‘when § 11 and § 12[(a)](2) claims are grounded in\n       fraud rather than negligence, Rule 9(b) applies.’\n\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 161.\n\n                                 16\n\fshould be acted upon; and (5) that the plaintiff acted upon it to\nhis [or her] damage.” Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 284. Where a\nplaintiff’s Section 11 or Section 12(a)(2) claims are not\ngrounded in allegations of fraud, the liberal notice pleading\nrequirements of Rule 8 apply. See In re Adams Golf, 381 F.3d\nat 273 n.5 (“[C]laims under the 1933 Act that do not sound in\nfraud are not held to the heightened pleading requirements of\n[Rule] 9(b).”). Rule 8 pleading merely requires “a short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Whether a Securities Act\nclaim is subject to Rule 9(b) requires an assessment of the\nparticular claim to determine whether acts of fraud on the part of\nthe defendants form the basis for the claim against them. See\nShapiro, 964 F.2d at 288 (“Rule 9(b) refers to ‘averments’ of\nfraud, and thus requires us to examine the factual allegations that\nsupport a particular legal claim.”); see also CALPERS, 394 F.3d\nat 160 (“[A]n examination of the factual allegations that support\nPlaintiffs’ section 11 claims establishes that the claims are\nindisputably immersed in unparticularized allegations of\nfraud.”).\n\n        Although, in its second amended complaint, Lead Class\nPlaintiff described its suit as arising out of a “massive fraud” at\nSuprema, stemming in particular from the allegedly material\nmisrepresentations in the registration statements that Suprema\nfiled in connection with the 2001 Offering, App. at 82, it\nprefaced its Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) counts with an\nexplicit disclaimer– “[t]his claim is not based on and does not\nsound in fraud”– prior to setting forth the factual allegations that\nsupport each claim for relief. App. at 93, 125. Lead Class\nPlaintiff made it clear that its particular claims for relief under\nthe Securities Act\n\n       are not based on any knowing or reckless\n       misconduct on the part of the defendants– i.e., they\n       do not allege, and do not sound in fraud. Rather,\n       they are premised on the fact that there were\n       material misrepresentations and omissions in the\n       Registration Statement, and the defendants’\n       negligence in failing to recognize this fact.\n\n\n                                 17\n\fApp. at 82. It expressly stated its cause of action as sounding in\nnegligence, claiming that “[h]ad they exercised reasonable care,\nthese defendants could have known of the material\nmisstatements and omissions alleged herein.” App. at 123.\n\n        In similar fashion, SSF Plaintiffs asserted at the outset\nthat their suit arises out of “one of New Jersey’s most scandalous\naccounting frauds,” App. at 260, but also stated clearly that\n“[t]his action seeks to advance negligence claims against the\nunderwriters, auditor, and signatories of Suprema’s publicly-\nfiled documents.” App. at 261. SSF Plaintiffs prefaced the\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) counts of the second amended\ncomplaint with the disclaimer that “[t]his claim is not based on\nand does not sound in fraud, and Plaintiffs expressly disclaim\nand exclude any allegation that could be construed as alleging\nfraud or intentional or reckless misconduct.” App. at 324. The\npreface to the Section 11 count further states that “this claim is\nbased . . . solely on claims of strict liability and/or negligence\nunder the Securities Act.” App. at 324. At the heart of the\nclaims was the allegation that the named defendants were\nnegligent in their failure to uncover the fraud at Suprema.\n\n        The District Court held that both complaints sound in\nfraud, mainly because “‘the wording and imputations of the\ncomplaint[s] are classically associated with fraud.’” App. at 14\n(quoting Rombach, 355 F.3d at 172). Among other things, the\nDistrict Court noted that Lead Class Plaintiff alleged that the\naction arose from a “massive fraud” and that SSF Plaintiffs had\nidentified several specific false representations of material fact in\nthe 2000 and 2001 Registration Statements upon which they\nclaimed to have relied. Thus, although the District Court\nacknowledged that plaintiffs pleaded their claims as negligence-\nbased, it held that the Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims\nsound in fraud as to all defendants. Applying the heightened\npleading standard of Rule 9(b), the District Court determined\nthat the claims must fail because plaintiffs did not allege that any\nof the defendants knew of the falsity of their statements and\nintended for the statements to be acted upon.\n\n      Lead Class Plaintiff argues that the District Court erred\nbecause (1) the second amended complaint set forth no\n\n                                 18\n\fallegations of fraud with regard to the 2001 Underwriters and\nDirectors, and (2) it was careful to separately plead the\nfraudulent conduct of the Officers and BDO in connection with\nthe Section 10(b) claims from the conduct that supported the\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims. On that basis, and on\nthe basis that the Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims were\nexpressly pled as negligence claims, Lead Class Plaintiff\ncontends that its Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims should\nnot have been held to sound in fraud. SSF Plaintiffs likewise\ncontend that their claims were based solely on the defendants’\nnegligent failure to carry out their respective responsibilities and\nnot fraud on their part.\n\n        For their part, defendants principally rely upon our\ndecision in CALPERS, where we held that the heightened\npleading of Rule 9(b) applied to a Section 11 claim despite the\nplaintiffs’ express disavowal of fraud because “the claims [were]\nindisputably immersed in unparticularized allegations of fraud,”\nand “a core theory of fraud permeate[d] the entire Second\nAmended Complaint.” CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 160. We\nconcluded that “[t]he one-sentence disavowment of fraud\ncontained within Plaintiffs’ section 11 Count . . . does not\nrequire us to infer that the claims are strict liability or negligence\nclaims, and in this case is insufficient to divorce the claims from\ntheir fraudulent underpinnings.” Id.\n\n        Although defendants are correct to observe that this case\nresembles CALPERS inasmuch as a core theory of fraud\npermeates the action, we find this case easily distinguishable\nfrom CALPERS with respect to the manner in which plaintiffs\nhave pled their Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims. Unlike\nthe plaintiffs in CALPERS, plaintiffs in this case do not merely\ndisavow already-pled allegations of fraud in connection with\ntheir Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims, leaving the court to\n“sift through [those] allegations . . . in search of some ‘lesser\nincluded’ claim of strict liability.” CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 162\n(quoting Lone Star Ladies Inv. Club v. Schlotzky’s, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"22788\"><a href=\"/opinion/22788/lone-star-ladies-v-schlotzskys-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2001)). Rather, both plaintiffs have expressly\npled negligence in connection with their Section 11 and 12(a)(2)\nclaims. We regard this difference in pleading as dispositive.\n\n\n                                 19\n\f        In CALPERS, we subjected the plaintiff’s pleading to the\nstrictures of Rule 9(b) because the complaint was “completely\ndevoid of any allegations that Defendants acted negligently.”\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 161. Similarly, in Shapiro, we held that\nRule 9(b) applied to Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims\nbecause there was “not a hint in the allegations that defendants\nwere negligent in violating §§ 11 and 12[(a)](2).” Shapiro, 964\nF.2d at 287-88. Both CALPERS and Shapiro thus presented\ncomplaints containing allegations of fraud exclusively; no\nallegations of negligence were pled in support of the Securities\nAct claims. See, e.g., Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 288 (“[W]e are not\npresented with a mixture of allegations of negligence [and]\nfraud.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted). We observed in\nShapiro that “[i]t would be unreasonable to infer a negligence\ncause of action from [nothing more than a] fleeting and obscure\nreference [in the complaint] to ‘gross negligence.’” Id. at 288\nn.18.\n\n       Other courts of appeals presented with Section 11 or\n12(a)(2) claims premised exclusively on allegations of fraud have\nfollowed our approach in Shapiro and declined to infer\nnegligence where it has not been expressly pled. See, e.g., In re\nDaou Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790656\"><a href=\"/opinion/790656/in-re-daou-systems-inc-securities-litigation-greg-sparling-eugene/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1028 (9th Cir. 2005); Rombach, 355\nF.3d at 172; Melder v.

Conversely, where the claims are expressly premised on\nnegligence rather than fraud, Rule 9(b) has been held\ninapplicable. See Schwartz v. Celestial Seasonings, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155244\"><a href=\"/opinion/155244/schwartz-v-celestial-seasonings/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1251-52 (10th Cir. 1997) (assuming arguendo that\nthe approach in Shapiro is correct and holding that Section 11\nclaim not premised on fraud did not trigger Rule 9(b) scrutiny).\n\n       We now hold that where, as here, individual defendants\nare accused in separate claims of the same complaint of having\nviolated Section 11, Section 12(a)(2), and Section 10(b), the\nSecurities Act claims do not sound in fraud if ordinary\nnegligence is expressly pled in connection with those claims. In\nsuch a case, the fraud allegations cannot be said to\n“contaminate” the Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims if the\nallegations are pled separately. We applied Rule 9(b) to the\nSection 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims in Shapiro because\n“plaintiffs did not allege ordinary negligence” and we could “see\n\n                               20\n\fno way to construct a negligence cause of action.” Shapiro, 964\nF.2d at 288. Here, ordinary negligence is alleged in the Section\n11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims, and those claims are pled\nseparately from the Section 10(b) fraud claims against the same\ndefendants. That is enough to avoid triggering Rule 9(b). A\ncontrary result would effectively preclude plaintiffs from filing\nsuit under Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) as well as Section\n10(b)(5). There is no suggestion that Congress intended such an\nincongruous approach.\n\n        To be sure, the “sounds in fraud” determination for\nSecurities Act claims will not always be clear cut in cases where\nthe plaintiff simultaneously raises claims against the same\ndefendants under a provision that requires a showing of scienter,\nlike Section 10(b). But where the plaintiff has exercised care in\ndifferentiating asserted negligence claims from fraud claims and\nin delineating the allegations that support the negligence cause\nof action as distinct from the fraud, the determination is\nstraightforward.\n\n        Lead Class Plaintiff carefully segregated its allegations of\nnegligence against the Officers and BDO from its allegations of\nfraud against those defendants. It did so by pleading its Section\n11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims in negligence before– and wholly\napart from– pleading its fraud-based Section 10(b) claims. This\nmanner of pleading makes for a clear conceptual separation in\nthe complaint between claims sounding in negligence and those\nsounding in fraud. And while Lead Class Plaintiff prefaced its\ncomplaint with a general statement that its suit “arises out of the\nmassive fraud that was perpetrated at Suprema,” App. at 82, it\nwas careful in that introductory discussion not to accuse any\nparticular defendant of acting with fraudulent intent. As to its\nclaims against the Outside Directors and Underwriters in\nparticular, there are no allegations of fraud or reckless\nmisconduct whatsoever in any count of Lead Class Plaintiff’s\nsecond amended complaint; ordinary negligence is all that is\npled.\n\n        SSF Plaintiffs were less artful in their pleading, with the\nresult that allegations of negligence and allegations of fraud\nagainst the defendants are somewhat commingled in the second\n\n                                 21\n\famended complaint. Although we view this lapse in pleading as\ninexpert, we do not regard it as fatal under the circumstances.\nThe Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims were expressly pled\nin, and limited to, negligence, with preceding allegations of\nfraud expressly disavowed in the context of those claims.6\nWhile not as “clean” as the pleading style adopted by Lead Class\nPlaintiff, the SSF Plaintiffs’ allegations as set forth were\nsufficient to give notice to the defendants of the claims against\nthem.\n\n        In holding that Rule 9(b) does not apply to Section 11 or\nSection 12(a)(2) claims that are expressly pled in negligence\neven when Section 10(b) claims against some of the same\ndefendants are pled separately in the same complaint, we adopt a\nposition that is consistent with our holdings in Shapiro and\nCALPERS, and one that has already been adopted by a number\nof district courts within our circuit.

We found that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged\ntheir Section 11 standing, adding that “[b]efore discovery takes\nplace [ ] it is impossible for plaintiffs to know whether their shares\nwere newly issued or were purchased in the secondary market.” Id.\nThe question here is likewise a factual one, to be resolved through\ndiscovery, as to whether plaintiffs can demonstrate that the shares\nthey allegedly purchased are in fact traceable to the registration\nstatement alleged to be false and misleading.

Moreover,\n“Rule 9(b) requires plaintiffs to identify the source of the\nallegedly fraudulent misrepresentation or omission.” Id.\n(citation omitted). In sum, “Rule 9(b) requires, at a minimum,\nthat plaintiffs support their allegations of securities fraud with all\nof the essential factual background that would accompany ‘the\nfirst paragraph of any newspaper story’ – that is, the ‘who, what,\nwhen, where and how’ of the events at issue.” Id. at 217\n(quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory, 114 F.3d at 1422). To\nthe extent that Rule 9(b)’s allowance of general pleading with\nrespect to mental state conflicts with the PSLRA's requirement\nthat plaintiffs state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong\ninference that the defendant acted with scienter, 15 U.S.C. §\n78u-4(b)(2), the PSLRA “supersedes Rule 9(b) as it relates to\nRule 10b-5 actions.” In re Advanta, 180 F.3d at 531 n.5.\n\n1. The Officers\n\n       Plaintiffs pled the required scienter on the part of\nCocchiola and Venechanos (the “Officers”) by alleging both\nmotive and opportunity (with respect to insider stock sales) and\nstrong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or\nrecklessness (with respect to the round-trip sales scheme). The\nDistrict Court held that the alleged facts did not give rise to a\nstrong inference of the Officers’ scienter and dismissed the\nSection 10(b) claims. We conclude that plaintiffs’ allegations\nwere sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\na) Motive and Opportunity\n\n        Plaintiffs allege that Cocchiola and Venechanos sold\nsubstantial portions of their stock in the 2001 Offering and\ntherefore had the motive and opportunity to inflate the price of\ntheir stock. Although we have stated that “[w]e will not infer\nfraudulent intent from the mere fact that some officers sold\nstock,” we also stated that sales of company stock by insiders\nthat are “unusual in scope or timing . . . may support an\n\n                                 28\n\finference of scienter.” In re Advanta, 180 F.3d at 540 (citations\nand quotation marks omitted). Whether a sale is “unusual in\nscope” depends on factors such as “the amount of profit made,\nthe amount of stock traded, the portion of stockholdings sold, or\nthe number of insiders involved.” Wilson v. Bernstock, 195 F.\nSupp. 2d 619, 635 (D.N.J. 2002) (citation omitted). Other\nfactors relevant to scope and timing are whether the sales were\n“normal and routine,” and whether the profits were substantial\nrelative to the seller’s ordinary compensation. In re Burlington\nCoat Factory, 114 F.3d at 1423.\n\n       The second amended complaints differ as to precisely\nhow many shares Cocchiola sold in the 2001 Offering. Lead\nClass Plaintiff alleges that Cocchiola sold 31% of his total\nholdings (193,423 shares) for proceeds of just over $2 million,\nand that he sold another 81,577 shares in the over-allotment, for\nnearly $1 million in further proceeds.9 SSF Plaintiffs allege that\nCocchiola sold 347,809 shares for proceeds of over $4 million.\nThey further allege that Cocchiola pledged another 200,000\nshares as collateral for a $600,000 personal loan. Both plaintiffs\nagree that Venechanos sold 38% of his total holdings (52,937\nshares) in the 2001 Offering for proceeds of nearly $628,000.\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that these insider sales were suspicious in\ntiming because they came at a time when the price of Suprema’s\nstock was artificially inflated as a result of the round-trip sales\nscheme, just six weeks before Venechanos and Christensen\nresigned. Furthermore, they allege that the sales were suspicious\nin scope because Cocchiola had sold only 50,000 shares before\nthe 2001 Offering and Venechanos had sold none. Cocchiola\nsold over five times the number of shares in the 2001 Offering\nthan he had sold prior to that time. With respect to the ratio of\n\n\n       9\n        According to Lead Class Plaintiff, Cocchiola was the\nlargest holder of Suprema common stock when Suprema filed its\n2001 Form 10-K statement, exercising ownership or control over\n1.1 million shares representing approximately 17.4% of the stock\nissued and outstanding. Venechanos at that time allegedly\nexercised ownership or control over 138,000 shares, or\napproximately 2.4% of the common stock.\n\n                                29\n\fprofits to compensation, SSF Plaintiffs allege that Cocchiola’s\nprofits from the stock sale nearly doubled in one day the total\namount of money that he had made over the previous three years\ncombined. The sales Venechanos made netted him over four\ntimes his annual salary.\n\n        Citing our decision in In re Advanta, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the\nDistrict Court held that the sales made in the 2001 Offering were\nnot unusual because “both Cocchiola and Venechanos retained\nlarge stock holdings after the sales, 49% and 62%, respectively.”\nApp. at 27-28. We conclude, however, that the stock sales here\ndiffer substantially from the sales in In re Advanta. In that case,\nthe defendants traded only small percentages of their holdings,\nwith two of the defendants selling seven and five percent,\nrespectively. In re Advanta, 180 F.3d at 540. Here, each Officer\nis alleged to have sold over 30 percent of his holdings. Plaintiffs\nhave plausibly alleged that the sales were not normal or routine\nfor these Officers, and that the profits from the trades were\nsubstantial in comparison to their overall compensation. Indeed,\nLead Class Plaintiff alleges that Cocchiola realized over $2.3\nmillion in profit from the sale of his shares, and Venechanos\n$627,832. The timing of the sales was also suspect in that they\noccurred just six weeks before Venechanos and Christensen\nresigned. We conclude that plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the\nstock sales are sufficient at this stage to support a strong\ninference that Cocchiola and Venechanos had a motive and\nopportunity to inflate the value of their stock artificially by\nreporting fictitious sales and by falsely inflating the value of\ntheir inventory in public statements.\n\nb) Circumstantial Evidence of Misconduct\n\n        Plaintiffs alleged numerous facts that they argue\nconstitute strong circumstantial evidence that the Officers knew\nof or recklessly disregarded the falsity of Suprema’s registration\nstatements and prospectuses with respect to reported financial\nperformance. Among other things, plaintiffs cite the following:\nCocchiola and Venechanos were the leaders of a very small\nsenior management team at Suprema which boasted a “hands-\non” relationship with key accounts and customers, App. at 128;\nthree of these key customers pled guilty to fraud charges in\n\n                                30\n\fconnection with the round-trip sales scheme and admitted in\ntheir plea allocutions that they had created false invoices, falsely\nlabeled cheese, and adulterated cheese “at the direction and with\nthe participation of Suprema’s management,” App. at 133;10\nfictitious transactions with these customers constituted “more\nthan two-thirds of the company’s revenue and nearly all of its\ngrowth” during the class period, App. at 187; Cocchiola and\nVenechanos signed millions of dollars in company checks during\nthe class period, payable in large part to entities controlled by\nthese customers; Venechanos controlled all of the bookkeeping\nconnected with these accounts and he and Cocchiola prevented\nSuprema’s accounting staff from having any contact with the\naccounts or with BDO concerning the accounts; Cocchiola and\nVenechanos instructed Suprema employees not to be involved in\nthe hard cheese portion of the business; and Cocchiola prevented\nSuprema employees from having contact with BDO concerning\nthe accounts.\n\n        We thus conclude that plaintiffs’ allegations against the\nOfficers are detailed as to each and are sufficient to give rise to\nthe requisite strong inference that these defendants knew that the\nstatements they made in connection with the 2000 and 2001\nOfferings were materially false and misleading. We reject\ndefendants’ contention that plaintiffs have merely pled “fraud by\ntitle.” On the contrary, plaintiffs have attributed to each of the\nOfficers specific knowledge and conduct. Moreover, even if\nplaintiffs’ allegations with respect to the Officers’ insider stock\nsales were insufficient to support a strong inference that they\nacted with scienter, the allegations concerning the Officers’\nrespective roles in the round-trip sales scheme would be enough\nto survive a motion to dismiss. On this record, we will vacate\nthe District Court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ 10(b) claims against\nthe Officers.\n\n\n       10\n         Lead Class Plaintiff specifically alleged that “Cocchiola,\nVenechanos, and Lauriero (when he was alive) . . . collectively\nconstituted the ‘management’ of Suprema throughout the Class\nPeriod[.]” App. at 135. Further, as counsel for Lead Class Plaintiff\nemphasized at argument before this court, Suprema “was a small\ncompany, this was not IBM[.]” Tr. of Oral Argument at 13.\n\n                                31\n\f2. The Auditor\n\n        The District Court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against\nBDO for failure adequately to allege scienter. The court rejected\nplaintiffs’ allegations that BDO acted recklessly by failing to\ntake numerous steps required by GAAS, and that BDO failed to\nheed “red flags” indicating that something was grossly amiss\nwith Suprema’s accounting. The District Court found that the\n“purported ‘red flags’ were normal aspects of a healthy\nbusiness,”and it credited BDO’s argument that it had a good\nfaith belief that its audits were accurate.

It is insufficient, for\nexample, for a plaintiff to cite GAAS standards without an\nexplanation of how the defendant knowingly or recklessly\nviolated those standards. In re Westinghouse Sec. Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722540\"><a href=\"/opinion/722540/in-re-westinghouse-securities-litigation-margaret-alessi-gloria/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n        Plaintiffs here have alleged that BDO failed to comply\nwith specific GAAS standards, including, among others, the\nrequirement to exercise due care and professional skepticism in\nthe conduct of an audit; the requirement adequately to plan, staff,\nand supervise an audit; the requirement adequately to assess the\nnature of the audited business; and the requirement to recognize\nenumerated risk factors or red flags that may have alerted the\nauditor to the existence of fraud. Moreover, plaintiffs explain in\ndetail in the second amended complaints how BDO’s alleged\nGAAS violations led it to overlook numerous red flags. Thirty\nsuch red flags are cited as having been present in this case,\nincluding the following: (1) Suprema’s 2001 Form 10-K made\nno mention that Suprema was engaged in the purchase and resale\nof bulk cheese from domestic suppliers when even a cursory\nreview of the company’s check register, vendor invoices, and\npurchasing records would have revealed that fully two-thirds of\ncompany revenue for that year was derived from such sales; (2)\nSuprema’s cash flows from operations were negative and grew\ndramatically worse over time, even though Suprema was\nreporting astronomical growth in net sales, gross margin, and net\nearnings, including a 400% increase in hard-cheese revenue\n\n                                33\n\fduring just a two-year period; (3) Suprema posted growth that\nwas radically disproportionate with growth in the cheese\nindustry as a whole; (4) although Suprema was reporting rapid\ngrowth in production, it did not report corresponding increases in\nits labor force and the utilization of its production facilities; (5)\nSuprema restricted BDO’s access to key accounting personnel,\nincluding the accounts receivable and accounts payable\nsupervisors, which represented a material limitation of the scope\nof the audit; (6) all of Suprema’s significant hard-cheese\ncustomers had accounts that were well past due; and (7)\nSuprema had weak internal controls, a fact that BDO essentially\nadmitted in its letter of resignation, and one that should have led\nBDO to investigate further before issuing unqualified audit\nopinions.\n\n        BDO argues some of the proffered red flags, such as late\nor missing invoices, delayed compliance with document\nrequests, and payment of stock options and large bonuses to\nmanagement, are not obvious or strong indicators of fraud.\nHowever, even if we discount these weaker indicators, the much\nstronger indicators noted above remain, and those factors are\nsufficient to raise serious questions about the integrity of the\naudits.\n\n       Indeed, accepting plaintiffs’ allegations as true, the\nevidence of Suprema’s financial foul play was hiding in plain\nsight. Suprema management was a small group, and the\ncompany had only five “customers” that accounted for more than\n80% of its business in 2001. Its largest customer that year,\nTricon, and its largest supplier, Noram, were both owned and\ncontrolled by one individual, Paul Zambas. Even a cursory\ninquiry would have disclosed that the address for Tricon in\nSuprema’s business records was not the same as Tricon’s\naddress available in public records; the address to which\nSuprema sent checks to Noram was a gift shop in a mall; and,\nmost tellingly, checks from Tricon to Suprema came from the\nsame bank account into which Suprema’s checks to Noram were\ndeposited. Similarly, the tens of millions of dollars in checks\nthat Suprema wrote to another supplier, CMM, were also\ndeposited into the same account from which a purported\ncustomer, WCC, wrote checks back to Suprema. The checks\n\n                                 34\n\fwere an obvious and readily available indicator of fraud.\nMoreover, plaintiffs have offered a detailed set of allegations as\nto how BDO violated specific GAAS standards in its audit of\nSuprema, and they have identified numerous substantive\nindicators of fraud that were allegedly ignored altogether in the\nauditing process. “[I]n many cases the most plausible means to\nprevail on a section 10(b) claim against an auditor– without that\never-elusive ‘smoking gun’ document or admission– will be to\nshow how specific and not insignificant accounting violations\ncollectively raise an inference of scienter.” In re IKON, 277\nF.3d at 677 n.26; see also PR Diamonds, Inc. v. Chandler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785790\"><a href=\"/opinion/785790/pr-diamonds-inc-v-john-p-chandler/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (6th Cir. 2004) (“[W]hen the alleged accounting\nerrors are sufficiently basic and large, their existence, in\ncombination with other factors, may support the requisite\nscienter inference.”) (citation omitted). The accounting\nviolations set forth here surpass an inference of ordinary\nnegligence; they reasonably suggest that BDO either knew of, or\nwillfully turned a blind eye to, the fraud at Suprema.\n\n        We have not overlooked BDO’s protestations that it, too,\nwas a victim of the fraud at Suprema, that the fraud conspirators\nhid information from and lied to BDO about Suprema’s finances,\nand that BDO performed its audits in good faith under the\ncircumstances. We are not suggesting that plaintiffs’ Section\n10(b) claim will necessarily survive a properly supported\nsummary judgment motion after BDO marshals its evidence. At\nthe pleading stage, however, plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit\nof all reasonable inferences based on the detailed and specific\nallegations in their complaints. In the face of the numerous and\nnot insignificant alleged accounting violations, we cannot rule\nout, as a matter of law, a strong and reasonable inference of\nBDO’s scienter. Consequently, we will vacate the District\nCourt’s dismissal of the Section 10(b) claims against BDO.\n\n3. The Outside Directors\n\n       The District Court dismissed SSF Plaintiffs’ Section\n10(b) claim against the Outside Directors, holding that the\nallegations supporting the claim were conclusory and lacking in\n\n\n\n                                35\n\fdetail.11 SSF Plaintiffs premise their allegations of recklessness\nagainst the Outside Directors essentially on the following facts:\n(1) revenue was wrongfully recognized; (2) the Outside\nDirectors had access to Suprema’s business records; and (3) the\nOutside Directors were charged, as members of the audit\ncommittee, with reviewing and monitoring the company’s\nfinancial reporting, external audits, internal control functions,\nand compliance with applicable rules and regulations.\n\n       Significantly, while the SSF Plaintiffs alleged specifically\nwhat the audit committee’s duties were, they did not allege\nwhich duties were violated, by whom they were violated, or how\nthey were violated. Indeed, whereas the allegations concerning\nBDO’s recklessness span more than forty pages of the SSF\nPlaintiffs’ second amended complaint, the corresponding\nallegations against the four Outside Directors are scant,\ncomprising fewer than two pages. Recklessness is pled against\nthe Outside Directors as a group, based on their position, without\nany attempt to link specific individuals to specific instances of\nreckless conduct. We have held that such “catch-all” or\n“blanket” assertions do not satisfy the particularity requirements\nof Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA, and must be disregarded.\nCALPERS, 394 F.3d at 145.\n\n        A pleading of scienter sufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b) “may\nnot rest on a bare inference that a defendant ‘must have had’\nknowledge of the facts” or “must have known” of the fraud\ngiven his or her position in the company. In re Advanta, 180\nF.3d at 539 (citations omitted). As we have stated,\n“[g]eneralized imputations of knowledge do not suffice,\nregardless of the defendants’ positions within the company.” Id.\n(citation omitted). The allegation that the Outside Directors, qua\ndirectors and members of the audit committee, had access to\nunspecified business records and a duty to review them does not\ngive rise to a strong inference that the Outside Directors\nindividually knew of or recklessly disregarded particular\n\n\n       11\n         As noted, Lead Class Plaintiff did not file a Section 10(b)\nclaim against the Outside Directors, nor did it file such a claim\nagainst the Underwriters.\n\n                                36\n\fwrongful recognitions of revenue. We will, therefore, affirm the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of SSF Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims\nagainst the Outside Directors.\n\n4. The 2000 and 2001 Underwriters\n\n        The District Court also dismissed SSF Plaintiffs’ Section\n10(b) claim against the Underwriters, holding that the allegations\nsuggested negligence only and did not reach the threshold for\nscienter. In the second amended complaint, SSF Plaintiffs\nalleged that the Underwriters collectively “failed to adequately\nreview Suprema’s internal financial forecasts, contracts, and\nother documents, make a physical inspection of Suprema’s major\nfacilities, employ analysts having expertise in the cheese\nbusiness, conduct interviews with Suprema’s senior and middle\nmanagement, or interview Suprema’s major customers, outside\nquality consultants, auditors, and legal counsel.” App. at 381-\n82. SSF Plaintiffs also alleged that the Underwriters earned\nsignificant fees for services rendered in connection with the\npublic offerings.\n\n        “A securities professional has an obligation to investigate\nthe securities he or she offers to customers.” SEC v. GLT Dain\nRauscher, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773768\"><a href=\"/opinion/773768/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-dain-rauscher-inc-kenneth-d-ough/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 857 (9th Cir. 2001). The\ninvestigation must be adequate to provide the professional “with\na reasonable basis for a belief that the key representations in the\nstatements provided to . . . investors [a]re truthful and complete.”\nId. at 858 (citations omitted). Whereas a reckless failure to\ninvestigate an issuer of securities can give rise to liability under\nSection 10(b), simple negligence, even inexcusable negligence,\nis not enough. Infinity, 212 F.3d at 192. Nor is an allegation\nthat an underwriter had a motive to commit fraud simply because\nit stood to collect underwriting fees. GSC, 368 F.3d at 238.\n\n       Our review of the SSF Plaintiffs’ allegations confirms the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that they failed adequately to allege\nscienter. The breaches alleged are, at best, negligent breaches of\nthe duty to investigate. The fact that the Underwriters earned\nfees for their services does not establish that they acted with any\nculpable intent. Moreover, plaintiffs’ manner of pleading their\nclaim collectively, through blanket allegations against numerous\n\n                                37\n\fdifferent defendants, runs afoul of the particularity requirements\nof the PSLRA and Rule 9(b). See CALPERS, 394 F.3d at 145.\nPlaintiffs accuse all of the Underwriters of having breached\nvarious aspects of the duty to investigate, but they fail to allege\nany specific derogation of duty on the part of any specific\ndefendant. Given the lack of particularity in their pleading, and\ngiven that they have alleged a mental state amounting to no more\nthan negligence, SSF Plaintiffs have failed to state a Section\n10(b) claim. We will affirm the dismissal of the Section 10(b)\nclaim against the Underwriters.\n\nC. Section 18 Claims\n\n        SSF Plaintiffs asserted a claim for relief under Section 18\nof the Exchange Act against the Officers, Outside Directors, and\nBDO for their alleged negligence in connection with the false\nstatements purportedly made in documents that Suprema filed\nwith the SEC. Section 18 creates a private remedy for damages\nresulting from the purchase or sale of a security in reliance upon\na false or misleading statement contained in any document or\nreport filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.\n15 U.S.C. § 78r(a).12 SSF Plaintiffs concede that to state their\n\n\n       12\n            Section 78r(a) provides in relevant part:\n\n                Any person who shall make or cause\n                to be made any statement in any\n                application, report, or document filed\n                pursuant to this chapter or any rule or\n                regulation thereunder or any\n                undertaking contained in a registration\n                statement as provided in subsection\n                (d) of section 78o of this title, which\n                statement was at the time and in the\n                light of the circumstances under which\n                it was made false or misleading with\n                respect to any material fact, shall be\n                liable to any person (not knowing that\n                such statement was false or\n                misleading) who, in reliance upon\n\n                                   38\n\fclaim under Section 18, they were required to plead actual, as\nopposed to presumed, reliance upon a false or misleading\nstatement.

The District Court held that, absent\nallegations of reliance on specific statements, the claims were\ninadequately pled.\n\n        We agree that plaintiffs were required to plead actual\nreliance on specific statements contained in the SEC filings at\nissue. Section 18 plainly refers to reliance upon any materially\nfalse “statement.” See 15 U.S.C. § 78r(a) (“Any person who\nshall make . . . any statement in any application, report, or\ndocument[,] . . . which statement was [materially false,] . . . shall\nbe liable to any person . . . who, in reliance upon such statement,\nshall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was\naffected by such statement.”) (emphasis added).

Id. at 269 (emphasis added).\n\n        SSF Plaintiffs alleged cursorily that they “received,\nreviewed, actually read, and relied upon” various Form 10-Q\nfilings and the 2000 and 2001 Form 10-K filings. For example,\nregarding the September 28, 2001, Form 10-K, they allege that\nthey “obtained this document at or about the it [sic] was publicly\nfiled with the SEC, and actually read and relied upon it in\nmaking their decisions to invest in Suprema common stock.”\nApp. at 367. SSF Plaintiffs failed, however, to plead facts\nprobative of their actual reliance on any specific false statements\ncontained in those filings.

The\nDistrict Court dismissed these claims on the ground that the\nOfficers’ underlying violations of the securities laws were\ninadequately pled, and thus the control-person claims must fail,\nas well. We have concluded, however, that plaintiffs did\nadequately plead their Section 11, Section 12(a)(2), and Section\n10(b) claims against the Officers.\n\n       Plaintiffs contend, moreover, that the District Court\nmisconstrued the nature of their control-person claims. They\nnote that their Section 15 and Section 20(a) counts were\npremised upon underlying violations by Suprema itself, even\nthough Suprema is not named as a defendant because it is\nbankrupt. Plaintiffs contend that while the Officers were alleged\nto have committed primary violations in other counts of the\nsecond amended complaints, Suprema was the alleged primary\nviolator for purposes of the control-person claims.\n\n\n\n\n              person acted in good faith and did not\n              directly or indirectly induce the act or\n              acts constituting the violation or cause\n              of action.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).\n       16\n         We also have held that “secondary liability cannot be\nfound under Section 20(a) unless it can be shown that the\ndefendant was a culpable participant in the fraud.” Rochez Bros.,\nInc. v. Rhoades, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"331904\"><a href=\"/opinion/331904/rochez-brothers-inc-a-pennsylvania-corporation-v-charles-r-rhoades/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 890 (3d Cir. 1975); see also Sharp,\n649 F.2d at 185 (“One element of any case imposing liability under\n§ 20(a) is ‘culpable participation’ in the securities violation.”).\n\n                                42\n\f       The record reveals that plaintiffs did expressly name the\ncorporation itself as the primary violator in their Section 15 and\nSection 20(a) counts. Both plaintiffs also asserted that they\nwould have named Suprema as a defendant to the suits were it\nnot for its status as a bankrupt. Essentially, plaintiffs argue that\nSuprema’s controlling persons should not escape liability under\nSection 15 and Section 20(a) merely because Suprema’s\nunderlying liability cannot be formally adjudicated due to its\ninsolvency. We agree.\n\n       As noted, Section 15 imposes joint and several liability\nfor any person who controls a person liable under the Securities\nAct, while Section 20(a) imposes similar control liability for an\nunderlying violator of the Exchange Act. With regard to Section\n20(a), we have observed that “[t]he text of the statute plainly\nrequires the plaintiff to prove not only that one person controlled\nanother person, but also that the ‘controlled person’ is liable\nunder the Act. If no controlled person is liable, there can be no\ncontrolling person liability.” Shapiro, 964 F.2d at 279 (citation\nomitted). The same holds true for claims brought under Section\n15. See, e.g., Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762535\"><a href=\"/opinion/762535/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90450-steven-g-cooperman-v-individual-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52\n(1st Cir. 1999). Thus, establishing the liability of the controlled\nperson or entity is plainly an element of a claim for relief under\nboth Section 15 and Section 20(a).\n\n        But there is no requirement in the language of either\nstatute that the controlled person be named as a defendant as a\npredicate to imposing liability upon the controlling individual\ndefendants. A plaintiff need only establish the controlled\nperson’s liability. See In re Hayes Lemmerz Intern., Inc., 271 F.\nSupp. 2d 1007, 1022 n. 11 (E.D. Mich. 2003) (“[I]f the\ncomplaint states a primary violation by the Company, even if the\nCompany is not named in the complaint as a defendant, then a §\n20 claim can stand if the individuals were controlling persons.”);\nIn re CitiSource, Inc.

As one district court has cogently observed,\n“it would be inconsistent with the broad remedial purposes of the\n\n                                 43\n\fsecurities laws to permit senior executives of a bankrupt\ncorporation– whose actions allegedly contributed to the\nbankruptcy– to avoid liability by relying on the corporation’s\nbankruptcy.” Schleicher v.

Ind. July 14, 2005).\n\n        Plaintiffs here adequately alleged primary violations of\nthe Securities Act and the Exchange Act by Suprema. Lead\nClass Plaintiff set forth in detail the specific allegations of\nSuprema’s misstatements and omissions in its Registration\nStatement and Prospectus, and it expressly asserted that Suprema\nshould be primarily liable as a result under Section 15. Lead\nClass Plaintiff also detailed the allegations of materially false\nand misleading statements and omissions in SEC filings and\nasserted that Suprema should be held primarily liable under\nSection 20(a). SSF Plaintiffs set forth similar and equally\nsufficient allegations. The complaints also detailed the manner\nin which Cocchiola and Venechanos are alleged to have tightly\ncontrolled Suprema’s business and operations and acted as\nculpable participants in the fraud, as discussed in connection\nwith plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims against those defendants.\nFor these reasons, we will vacate the dismissal of plaintiffs’\nSection 15 and Section 20(a) claims against the Officers.17\n\nE. Pendent State law claims\n\n       After dismissing all claims brought under federal law, the\n\n\n       17\n         SSF Plaintiffs also asserted Section 15 and Section 20(a)\nclaims against the Outside Directors. In their opening brief,\nhowever, SSF Plaintiffs devote a mere one paragraph to their\ncontrol-person claims, and that paragraph makes no mention of the\nOutside Directors per se and provides no substantive discussion of\nthe claims against those defendants. Although SSF Plaintiffs argue\nthe claim at length in their reply brief, it is well-settled in this court\nthat “an appellant's failure to identify or argue an issue in his\nopening brief constitutes waiver of that issue on appeal.” United\nStates v. Pelullo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789362\"><a href=\"/opinion/789362/united-states-v-leonard-a-pelullo-united-states-of-america-v-leonard-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (3d Cir. 2005). Consequently,\nwe deem SSF Plaintiffs’ control-person claims against the Outside\nDirectors waived.\n\n                                   44\n\fDistrict Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) over the SSF Plaintiffs’ state-law\nclaims based on common law fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation. The District Court did not address the merits\nof the state law claims. Given our conclusion that many of the\nfederal claims were improperly dismissed at this preliminary\nstage, and that the District Court therefore retains jurisdiction\nover the federal claims, we will vacate the dismissal of the state-\nlaw claims for reconsideration by the District Court.\n\n                                III.\n\n        We will affirm the District Court’s dismissal of both\nplaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claims against the Outside Directors and\nthe Underwriters, as well as the dismissal of the Section 18\nclaims in their entirety. We will reverse the dismissal of\nplaintiffs’ Section 11 and 12(a)(2) claims against all defendants,\nthe Section 10(b) claims against the Officers and BDO, the\nSection 15 and 20(a) claims as to the Officers, and the dismissal\nof the SSF Plaintiffs’ claims under state law. We will remand\nthe matter to the District Court for further proceedings on the\nremaining claims in accordance with this opinion.\n____________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                45\n\f</pre>",
