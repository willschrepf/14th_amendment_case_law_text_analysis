Zubrzycki, Attorney, U.S. Department of\nJustice, argued the cause for appellees. With her on the brief\nwere Benjamin C. Mizer, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, and H. Thomas Byron III, Attorney. Mark B. Stern\nand Joshua P. Waldman, Attorneys, entered appearances.\n\n   Before: BROWN and SRINIVASAN, Circuit Judges, and\nEDWARDS, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n    Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge BROWN.\n\n    BROWN, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Appellants are three federal prisoners who spent several\nyears housed in specially designated Communication\nManagement Units (CMUs), a classification that meant family\nvisits and communications with the outside world were\ncurtailed. Appellants contend their designation to CMUs\nviolated their due process rights. One appellant also alleges\nhis continued CMU placement was in retaliation for protected\nspeech in violation of the First Amendment. Finally,\nappellants seek damages under the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct (PLRA) for a variety of injuries allegedly arising out of\ntheir confinement in CMUs, including the denial of certain\neducational and professional programming, violations of their\nconstitutional rights, and harm to familial relationships. The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the government\non each claim.\n\n    Because we find the duration and atypicality of CMU\ndesignation sufficient to give rise to a liberty interest, we\nreverse the district court and remand for further proceedings\nto determine whether appellants were afforded sufficient\nprocess. With respect to the retaliation claim, we affirm the\ngrant of summary judgment for the government because\n\f                               3\nappellant cannot show his First Amendment rights were\nviolated. Unlike the district court, we hold appellants have\nalleged harms qualifying for compensation under the PLRA\nbecause their injuries were neither mental nor emotional in\nnature and so do not require a showing of physical injury. We\nnonetheless uphold the grant of summary judgment because\nwe find the prison official entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                               I.\n\n             A. Communication Management Units\n\n     The CMUs at the heart of this controversy are located at\ntwo federal correctional facilities in Terre Haute, Indiana, and\nMarion, Illinois. They were established in 2006 and 2008,\nrespectively. See Aref v. Holder, 774 F. Supp. 2d 147, 153\n(D.D.C. 2011). The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) designed\nCMUs in response to a problem identified by the Department\nof Justice: a “deficiency” in the monitoring of inmate\ncommunications that allowed several inmates with terrorism-\nrelated convictions to communicate with extremist groups\noutside the prisons. CMUs thus house inmates who require\ncommunications monitoring beyond that which can feasibly\nbe provided in the general population.\n\n     CMU inmates have access to more limited and less\nprivate communications compared to general population\ninmates. All visits—aside from attorney visits—must be\n“non-contact,” meaning a glass wall separates the inmate and\nvisitor and communication takes place via a microphone. See\n28 C.F.R § 540.205(a). All visits must be conducted in\nEnglish, live-monitored, and recorded by BOP. See id.\nAlthough BOP regulations allow visitation to be restricted to\nfour one-hour visits each month, id., BOP currently permits\nup to eight hours a month. CMU inmates are also restricted in\n\f                                4\nthe frequency and length of their written correspondence,\nwhich is subject to inspection. See id. § 540.203. Finally,\nexcept for unmonitored attorney calls, CMU inmates can\ntelephone only immediate family members, and the calls are\nmonitored. Id. § 540.204. Under the regulation, telephonic\ncommunication can be limited to no more than three fifteen-\nminute calls per month, id., but BOP currently allows inmates\ntwo fifteen-minute calls per week.\n\n     Aside from these restrictions, CMUs essentially function\nas “self-contained general population housing unit[s].” J.A.\n108. Inmates typically are not confined to their cells except at\nnight and during security checks. They have access to\ncommon areas for up to sixteen hours a day, recreational\nfacilities, exercise equipment, and the library. They can keep\npersonal property in their cells, participate in religious\nservices, receive educational and professional training, and be\ndesignated for work assignments.\n\n     An inmate can be designated to a CMU for several\nreasons, including having a conviction offense related to\ninternational or domestic terrorism; demonstrating a\npropensity for using communication channels to further\nillegal activity outside the prison or to contact victims;\nabusing approved communication methods; or presenting a\npotential threat to prison facilities or the public as a result of\nunmonitored communications with persons outside the prison.\nSee 28 C.F.R § 540.201. 1 Designation to a CMU begins\nwhen BOP becomes aware of information relevant to any of\n1\n  It bears noting that both CMUs were opened before BOP\nestablished any written designation criteria. In April 2010, BOP\npublished a proposed rule for public notice-and-comment. See 80\nFed. Reg. 3168 (Jan. 22, 2015). The final rule entered into effect\non February 23, 2015, almost a decade after the first CMU opened.\nId.\n\f                                 5\nthese criteria. See id. § 540.202(a). BOP’s Assistant Director\nevaluates and approves the designation if, after a review of\nthe evidence, he concludes “designation . . . is necessary to\nensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protection of the public.” 2 Id.\n§ 540.202(b). Once in the CMU, the inmate receives a\nwritten Notice of Transfer (Notice) from the Warden\nexplaining      that   the    placement     allows    increased\ncommunications monitoring, the placement is non-punitive\nand will not affect the length of incarceration, and continued\ndesignation will be reviewed “regularly” with both notice and\nan opportunity to be heard. Id. § 540.202(c). The inmate also\nreceives “an explanation of the [Assistant Director’s] decision\nin sufficient detail,” unless the Assistant Director determines\nthat providing this information would jeopardize the safety of\nthe facility or the public. Id. § 540.202(c)(4). Finally, the\ninmate may challenge his CMU designation through BOP’s\nadministrative remedy program. Id. § 540.202(c)(6).\n\n      In 2009—three years after the first CMU opened—BOP\ninstituted periodic review of prisoners, allowing for potential\nredesignation every six months. See id. § 524.11(a)(2). The\n\n2\n   Before codification of the CMU regulations, the ultimate\ndecisionmaker was BOP’s Regional Director.              The process\notherwise has remained essentially the same. Initial consideration\nbegins when an entity (institutional or otherwise) refers a prisoner\nto BOP’s Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU). The CTU creates a\n“designation packet” that includes a summary of the supporting\ninformation, a recommendation for or against, and a proposed\nNotice of Transfer. The packet is sent to the Office of General\nCounsel to be reviewed for legal sufficiency and then to the\nCorrectional Programs Division. Previously, the Regional Director\nwould distribute the packet to several administrators, allowing each\nto comment before making his final decision. Now the Assistant\nDirector makes his assessment and decision independently.\n\f                                   6\nprocess begins with the inmate’s Unit Team making an initial\ndetermination about whether continued CMU placement is\nnecessary. The inmate must be given notice forty-eight hours\nbefore this review, which takes place in person. Id.\n§ 524.11(b)(1). The recommendation considers factors like\n“whether the original rationale for CMU designation has been\nmitigated” and “whether the inmate no longer presents a risk.”\nJ.A. 689.       The Warden then receives the transfer\nrecommendation for his review.            If he agrees, the\nrecommendation is sent to the Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU)\nfor its independent assessment—which is then forwarded to\nthe Assistant Director 3 for a final decision. The inmate is\ninformed in writing of the decision and (at least theoretically)\nprovided an explanation for the result. There is no limitation\non the duration of a prisoner’s CMU placement.\n\n                            B. The Plaintiffs\n\n     (1) Yassin Aref. Aref is an Iraqi refugee convicted of\nhelping a terrorist organization prepare to launch a missile\nattack on American soil by helping to finance the missile’s\npurchase. United States v. Aref, 285 F. App’x 784, 790 (2d\nCir. 2008). He is serving a fifteen-year sentence for money\nlaundering, providing material support for terrorism,\nconspiracy, and making a false statement to the FBI. Aref,\n774 F. Supp. 2d at 154. He was initially classified as a “low\nsecurity” inmate with no disciplinary record, but he was\ntransferred to the Terre Haute CMU in May 2007. Id. Within\na day, he received a one-page Notice stating his designation\nwas because of his terrorism-related conviction and because\nhis “offense conduct included significant communication,\nassociation, and assistance to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM),” a\ndesignated terrorist organization. Id. at 154–55. Aref\n\n3\n    Previously, the decision-maker was the Regional Director.\n\f                             7\nappealed, arguing he had never made contact with any JeM\nmembers; he had instead unknowingly been communicating\nwith an individual cooperating with the government. The\nRegional Director denied the appeal. After eighteen months,\nAref was transferred to the Marion CMU.\n\n     In September 2010, three years after Aref’s initial\ndesignation, his Unit Team and the Warden recommended\nhim for transfer. This request was denied after the CTU\nreceived confidential law enforcement information from the\nJoint Terrorism Task Force. He was notified about the denial,\nbut the notification provided no explanation. He was again\nrecommended for transfer in March 2011, and this time the\nCTU agreed. Since April 2011, he has been housed in Marion\nPrison’s general population.\n\n     (2) Kifah Jayyousi. In 2008, Jayyousi was sentenced to a\n152-month term for conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim\nin a foreign country and conspiracy to provide material\nsupport to terrorism. He and his co-conspirators were found\nto have communicated in code and posed as a charitable\norganization to further these goals. See United States v.\nJayyousi, 657 F.3d 1085, 1091–92 (11th Cir. 2011).\nAlthough he was originally classified as a “low security”\nprisoner, he was transferred to the Terre Haute CMU in June\n2008. Upon arrival, he received a Notice pointing to his\nterrorism-related conviction and offense conduct—which\ninvolved communication and association with al-Qaida—as\nthe basis for his transfer. He appealed administratively,\narguing this information was inaccurate; BOP denied his\nappeal without responding to his factual challenges.\n\n    Jayyousi was first considered for redesignation in\nDecember 2009, but his Unit Team recommended against it\nbecause of the severity of his offense. In October 2010, he\n\f                              8\nwas transferred to the Marion CMU. His Unit Team and\nWarden recommended him for transfer in 2011 based on good\nconduct.     Leslie Smith—then-Chief of BOP’s CTU—\ndisagreed because of a sermon Jayyousi gave as part of a\nMuslim prayer meeting in which he participated in 2008\nwhile at Terre Haute’s CMU. Although Jayyousi received a\ndisciplinary charge for that incident, he was cleared of any\nwrongdoing years before Smith considered this request. In\nMarch 2013, Jayyousi was again recommended for transfer,\nwhich was approved by the Regional Director without\nexplanation. He continues to be housed in Marion Prison’s\ngeneral population.\n\n     (3) Daniel McGowan. McGowan was a member of the\nEarth Liberation Front, a domestic terrorist organization.\nAref, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 155. He was sentenced to a seven\nyear term in 2007 for two counts of arson. Id. McGowan was\nalso originally classified as a “low security” prisoner with no\nprison disciplinary record. Nonetheless, he was transferred to\nthe Marion CMU in August 2008. He received his Notice ten\ndays later, which cited his offense conduct as involving arson\nand the “destruction of an energy facility,” as well as\ncommunicating in code and teaching others how to commit\narson. See id. McGowan appealed, challenging the factual\nassertions in his Notice as demonstrably false—pointing out\nhe had never been accused or convicted of any crime relating\nto the destruction of an energy facility. BOP did not respond\ndirectly to McGowan’s challenge, denied his appeal, and\ndirected him to his pre-sentence report, which contained no\nmention of any energy facility.\n\n     McGowan was first recommended for transfer in 2010,\nwhich the Regional Director denied without explanation. In\nJuly 2010, he was again recommended for transfer, which the\nRegional Director granted without explanation. A few\n\f                               9\nmonths later, BOP officials determined that McGowan was\nattempting to circumvent the communication monitoring\ncontrols imposed on the general population; he was thus\nredesignated to the CMU in 2011. He remained in the CMU\nuntil his release from prison in December 2012; he was fully\nreleased from BOP supervision in June 2013.\n\n                      C. Procedural History\n\n     On April 1, 2010, seven plaintiffs filed suit against BOP,\nalleging a variety of claims related to their CMU placement:\nviolation of their procedural due process rights due to\ninadequate notice and lack of opportunity to be heard;\nviolation of their substantive due process and First\nAmendment rights to “family integrity”; violation of the\nEighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual\npunishment; retaliatory transfer into the CMU in violation of\nthe First Amendment; and unlawful discrimination on the\nbasis of religion in violation of the First and Fifth\nAmendments. See Aref v. Holder, 953 F. Supp. 2d 133, 138\n(D.D.C. 2013). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, transfer out of the CMUs, and an order requiring they\nbe allowed the same communication privileges as other\nprisoners. See Aref, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 157.\n\n     The district court dismissed all but the procedural due\nprocess and First Amendment retaliation claims. See id. at\n161–71. In November 2012, Aref, Jayyousi, and McGowan\nfiled an amended complaint adding a retaliation claim against\ndefendants in their official capacities and against Leslie Smith\nin his individual capacity. Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 138. At\nthe motion to dismiss stage, the district court found the PLRA\nbarred plaintiffs’ individual-capacity claims and dismissed\n\f                                10\nMcGowan’s equitable claims as moot because he had been\nreleased from BOP custody. See id. at 142–44, 147–49. 4\n\n     Defendants then filed motions for summary judgment on\nthe remaining claims: Jayyousi and Aref’s official-capacity\ndue process claim and Jayyousi’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaim. In March 2015, the district court granted summary\njudgment in favor of defendants, finding plaintiffs lacked any\nliberty interest sufficient to trigger due process protections\nand that Jayyousi’s First Amendment rights were not violated.\nSee Aref v. Holder, No. 10-cv-0539, 2015 WL 3749621 at *1,\n*8–*9 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2015). Plaintiffs timely appealed. 5\n\n                                II.\n\n     We review the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment de novo. See Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v.\nFed. Trade Comm’n, 790 F.3d 198, 204 (D.C. Cir. 2015). In\ndoing so, we must “view the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party, draw all reasonable\ninferences in his favor, and eschew making credibility\ndeterminations or weighing the evidence.” Baumann v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 795 F.3d 209, 215 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\nWe also review the district court’s dismissal of appellants’\nindividual-capacity claims de novo. See Kimberlin v. U.S.\nDep’t of Justice, 318 F.3d 228, 231 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\n4\n  This case was originally assigned to Judge Urbina of the district\ncourt. It was transferred to Judge Rothstein on November 5, 2012,\nwho ruled on this motion to dismiss and the subsequent summary\njudgment motions. See Aref v. Holder, No. 10-cv-0539, 2015 WL\n3749621 at *2 n.1 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2015).\n5\n  Leslie Smith passed away on March 16, 2015. The government\ndid not file its notice of death until December 22, 2015—seven\nmonths later and after this appeal had begun. See Aref v. Lynch,\nDkt. #1554923, at 45.\n\f                              11\n                             III.\n\n     Since this lawsuit’s inception, the government has urged\nat least some if not all of plaintiff-appellants’ arguments are\nmoot because they were removed from the CMUs years ago.\nThe parties agree McGowan’s official-capacity claims are\nmooted by his full release from BOP custody, see Aref, 953 F.\nSupp. 2d at 142–43, so we consider only whether Aref and\nJayyousi’s transfer into general population moots their claims.\n\n     The mootness doctrine ensures compliance with Article\nIII’s case and controversy requirement by “limit[ing] federal\ncourts to deciding actual, ongoing controversies.” Am. Bar\nAss’n v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 636 F.3d 641, 645 (D.C. Cir.\n2011). Accordingly, mootness must be assessed at “all\nstages” of the litigation to ensure a live controversy remains.\n21st Century Telesis Joint Venture v. FCC, 318 F.3d 192, 198\n(D.C. Cir. 2003). A case is moot if our decision “will neither\npresently affect the parties’ rights nor have a more-than-\nspeculative chance of affecting them in the future.” Am. Bar\nAss’n, 636 F.3d at 645.\n\n     The government argues that, because it has been years\nsince any appellant was housed in a CMU, the appellants\ncannot identify any current injury for which this court can\nprovide effective relief. While “[n]ormally[] a prisoner’s\ntransfer or release from a prison moots any claim he might\nhave for equitable relief arising out of the conditions of his\nconfinement in that prison,” Scott v. District of Columbia, 139\nF.3d 940, 941 (D.C. Cir. 1998), appellants point to the\nlikelihood of redesignation from general population to a\nCMU. See, e.g., Aref, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 158 (“McGowan\nwas designated to a CMU, transferred back into the general\npopulation and then redesignated to a CMU.”). Appellants\nhave also challenged BOP’s reliance on flawed information\n\f                               12\nused to justify their CMU designations, which remains in their\nprison files. See Rezaq v. Nalley, 677 F.3d 1001, 1009 (10th\nCir. 2012) (holding prisoners’ claims not mooted by transfer\nout of maximum security facility because, “[e]ven though the\nnew transfer policies may provide adequate process, the case\nis not moot if the BOP made decisions under the old policies\nthat have ongoing, long-term consequences for the plaintiffs\nthat could be mitigated by an award of prospective relief”).\n\n      We need not decide that issue, however, because a\ndefendant’s voluntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct\ncan moot a case only if (i) “there is no reasonable expectation\n. . . that the alleged violation will recur,” and (ii) “interim\nrelief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated\nthe effects of the alleged violation.” Am. Bar Ass’n, 636 F.3d\nat 648. The government bears the “heavy” burden of showing\nit is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior\ncould not reasonably be expected to recur.” Friends of the\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189\n(2000) (emphasis added). We agree with the district court\nthat the government has not met this high bar. Moreover, as\nthe district court observed, appellants are challenging the\nprocedure used for designation—so even if new information\nwould be needed to return them to the unit, they have not\n“obtained all the relief” they seek in their complaint with\nrespect to the designation process. Schmidt v. United States,\n749 F.3d 1064, 1068 (D.C. Cir. 2014). We therefore conclude\nthe voluntary cessation exception applies and proceed to\nconsider appellants’ claims on the merits. 6\n6\n  The government also argues voluntary cessation only applies if\nthe cessation came about “because of” the litigation—an argument\nthe district court says the government waived. See Aref, 2015 WL\n3749621, at *4 n.3. The government claims the Ninth Circuit has\n“implied” this requirement. Pub. Utils. Comm’n of Cal. v. FERC,\n100 F.3d 1451, 1460 (9th Cir. 1996). But neither this circuit nor\n\f                                 13\n                                 IV.\n\n     Having found jurisdiction, we turn now to appellants’\ndue process claim. The Fifth Amendment ensures no\nindividual is “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without\ndue process of law.” U.S. CONST. amend. V. Appellants\nchallenge as inadequate the procedures used to designate them\nto the CMUs, claiming their transfer and lengthy placement in\nthe units deprived them of their liberty in violation of the\nConstitution. Outside the penal context, we simply would\nevaluate the procedures under the now familiar Mathews v.\nEldridge balancing test: first identifying the liberty interest at\nstake, then considering the risk of erroneous deprivation\nunder existing procedures, and finally weighing the\n\nthe Supreme Court consistently has required a finding that the\ncessation was undertaken because of the litigation. See, e.g.,\nFriends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 193–94 (assessing voluntary\ncessation without any indication the plant’s shutdown, years after\nthe case was filed, was a response to the litigation); Am. Iron &\nSteel Inst. v. EPA, 115 F.3d 979, 1006–07 (D.C. Cir. 1997)\n(analyzing as voluntary cessation an EPA policy change announced\nbefore litigation began). A defendant who ceased the challenged\nconduct for reasons unrelated to the litigation may have an easier\ntime showing the challenged conduct is unlikely to reoccur, but\n“the cessation of an ongoing activity pending a lawsuit may [also]\nwell imply an intent to renew the activity once the court has\ndropped out.” Clarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, 705–06 (D.C.\nCir. 1990). We are therefore unpersuaded by the government’s\nargument that appellants must prove their transfers were “because\nof” this litigation. And even if so, circumstantial evidence indicates\nthe transfers may have been motivated at least in part by the\npending litigation: not a single prisoner was transferred back into\ngeneral population during the first three years of the CMU, until a\nthen-named plaintiff was transferred out on the eve of this\nlitigation. All other named plaintiffs subsequently were transferred\nout during the pendency of this litigation.\n\f                              14\ngovernment’s interest against the burdens any additional\nprocess would entail. See 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976);\nLepelletier v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 164 F.3d 37, 45–46\n(D.C. Cir. 1999). This first step is complicated, however, by\nappellants’ incarceration, which “brings about the necessary\nwithdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights,”\nincluding the protections of due process. Jones v. N.C.\nPrisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 125 (1977).\n\n     Evaluating due process claims in this context thus\nrequires us to consider two competing—but significant—\nrealities. First, we must “giv[e] appropriate deference to the\ndecisions of prison administrators and appropriate recognition\nto the peculiar and restrictive circumstances of penal\nconfinement.” Id. Prison officials face the unenviable task of\nensuring the safety and security of large populations of people\nconvicted of crimes and frequently are confronted with novel\nchallenges in doing so. We therefore afford them “broad\nadministrative and discretionary authority over the institutions\nthey manage.” Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 467 (1983).\nAt the same time, prisoners are “not wholly stripped of\nconstitutional protections” once they pass through the prison\ngates. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555 (1974).\nGuarantees of due process may contract, but they are not\neliminated entirely.\n\n                        A. Liberty Interest\n\n     With these broad principles in mind, the Supreme Court\nin Sandin v. Conner articulated a new test for identifying\nliberty interests in confinement conditions. See 515 U.S. 472\n(1995). Courts previously had looked to state law to\ndetermine whether a liberty interest existed; under Sandin, the\ninquiry now focuses on the nature of the deprivation and its\nduration. Specifically, the Court held a liberty interest exists\n\f                               15\nonly if the conditions amount to an “atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.” Id. at 484. Absent a liberty interest, an inmate is\nnot entitled to any process.\n\n     In Sandin, a prisoner challenged the procedure used to\nplace him in disciplinary segregation for thirty days. The\nCourt held this placement did not amount to a liberty interest,\nnoting “disciplinary segregation, with insignificant\nexceptions, mirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates\nin administrative segregation and protective custody.” Id. at\n486. The Court observed inmates in that prison’s general\npopulation also had “significant amounts” of “lockdown\ntime.” Id. Finally, the Court found the inmate’s confinement\nwould not “inevitably affect” the length of his sentence. Id. at\n487. Thus, “a comparison between inmates inside and outside\ndisciplinary segregation” demonstrated his placement there\nfor 30 days “did not work a major disruption in his\nenvironment.” Id. at 486.\n\n                  (1) Precedent Applying Sandin\n\n     The Sandin Court did not define the baseline from which\nto measure what is “atypical and significant” in a particular\nprison system, so lower court assessments have diverged. See\nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 223 (2005). In Hatch v.\nDistrict of Columbia, our circuit adopted a multi-factor\napproach to determining the appropriate baseline. See 184\nF.3d 846, 856–58 (D.C. Cir. 1999). But because the district\ncourt and both parties rely on several instructive cases from\nother circuits, we find it helpful to briefly survey the current\nstate of the law before turning to our own standard.\n\f                                16\n     The Third, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits all generally look to\nadministrative confinement as the baseline. 7 See, e.g., Griffin\nv. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706–08 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding no\nliberty interest for inmate who, suspected of raping a prison\nguard, was placed in administrative confinement for fifteen\nmonths because inmates can reasonably expect to be placed in\nadministrative confinement during their sentence); Jones v.\nBaker, 155 F.3d 810, 812–13 (6th Cir. 1998) (finding no\nliberty interest for inmate placed in administrative segregation\nfor thirty months pending investigation for murder of a prison\nguard as segregation during investigation is not atypical and\nwas justified); Gaines v. Stenseng, 292 F.3d 1222, 1224–26\n(10th Cir. 2002) (remanding to district court to compare\nconditions in disciplinary segregation to those in\nadministrative segregation).\n\n    The Fifth Circuit, on the other hand, has held disciplinary\nsegregation can never implicate a liberty interest unless it\n“inevitably” lengthens a prisoner’s sentence, see Carson v.\n\n7\n  The Tenth Circuit has acknowledged some inconsistency in its\napplication: “[w]hen considering whether the conditions, duration\nor restrictions of confinement are atypical as compared with other\ninmates, this court has inconsistently used comparisons either with\ninmates in the same segregation or those in the general prison\npopulation.” Jordan v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 191 F. App’x 639,\n650 (10th Cir. 2006). Notably, regardless of which baseline it has\nused, the circuit “has never held the conditions, duration or\nrestrictions of the detentions presented on appeal created a liberty\ninterest.” Hill v. Fleming, 173 F. App’x 664, 670 (10th Cir. 2006).\nThe Tenth Circuit also uniquely considers whether the prison action\nis “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Jordan,\n191 F. App’x at 652–53 (finding no liberty interest in five year\ndetention in administrative segregation because “it was\ncommensurate with ongoing security concerns and a pending\ninvestigation”).\n\f                               17\nJohnson, 112 F.3d 818, 821 (5th Cir. 1997), and that\nadministrative segregation—being an ordinary incident of\nprison life—is essentially incapable of creating a liberty\ninterest, see Orellana v. Kyle, 65 F.3d 29, 31–32 (5th Cir.\n1995). 8 The Seventh Circuit also has adopted a high standard,\nholding the baseline is not just the conditions of confinement\nwithin that particular prison, but those at the harshest facility\nin the state’s most restrictive prison. See Wagner v. Hanks,\n128 F.3d 1173, 1175 (7th Cir. 1997). By contrast, the Fourth\nCircuit looks to the general population as the baseline. See\nBeverati v. Smith, 120 F.3d 500, 504 (4th Cir. 1997). And the\nSecond Circuit requires a fact-specific determination that\ncompares the duration and conditions of segregation with\nconditions in both administrative confinement and the general\npopulation. See, e.g., Arce v. Walker, 139 F.3d 329, 336 (2d\nCir. 1998); Brooks v. DiFasi, 112 F.3d 46, 48–49 (2d Cir.\n1997).      As a result, the Second Circuit has found\nconfinements as short as 180 and 305 days create a liberty\ninterest under Sandin. See Colon v. Howard, 215 F.3d 227,\n230–31 (2d Cir. 2000) (305 days); Kalwasinski v. Morse, 201\nF.3d 103, 106 (2d Cir. 1999) (180 days). In sum, divergences\nin the baseline often lead to divergences in outcome. We are\ntherefore cautious about relying too heavily on out-of-circuit\nprecedent in evaluating appellants’ claims, except to note that\ncourts are generally hesitant to find a liberty interest in the\nconfinement context.\n\n    Our circuit laid out its approach to the comparative\nbaseline in Hatch. The Hatch court examined Sandin’s\n8\n  The Fifth Circuit has found a liberty interest in a few\nextraordinary cases involving solitary confinement that spans\ndecades. See, e.g., Wilkerson v. Goodwin, 774 F.3d 845, 855 (5th\nCir. 2014) (finding liberty interest for prisoner kept in solitary\nconfinement for thirty-nine years given the exceptional duration\nand restrictive conditions of confinement).\n\f                                18\nlanguage and motivations to conclude a liberty interest arises\nonly when the deprivation “imposes an ‘atypical and\nsignificant’ hardship on an inmate in relation to the most\nrestrictive confinement conditions that prison officials . . .\nroutinely impose on inmates serving similar sentences.” 184\nF.3d at 856 (emphasis added). Because administrative\nsegregation is most routinely imposed, the court held it\nconstitutes the proper baseline. Id. In doing so, though, the\ncourt took pains to emphasize this comparison “does not end\nour analysis.” Id. We must look “not only to the nature of the\ndeprivation . . . but also to its length” in evaluating atypicality\nand significance. Id. Since Sandin noted the thirty-day\ndisciplinary segregation at issue “was within the range of\nconfinement to be normally expected for one serving an\nindeterminate term of [thirty] years to life,” 515 U.S. at 487\n(emphasis added), Hatch held atypicality also depends “in\npart on the length of the sentence the prisoner is serving.”\n184 F.3d at 856.\n\n     Applying this standard, the Hatch court remanded to the\ndistrict court for further fact-finding to determine whether the\ninmate’s segregation for twenty-nine weeks amounted to a\nliberty interest. Id. at 858. Specifically, the district court was\nto compare the conditions faced by the inmate (who was\nsegregated due to a disciplinary infraction) to the usual\nconditions of administrative segregation. Id. And even if the\ndistrict court concluded those conditions were “no more\nrestrictive” than administrative segregation, it was still\nrequired to determine whether confinement for twenty-nine\nweeks was “atypical” compared to the length of\nadministrative segregation routinely imposed on similarly\nsituated prisoners. Id.\n\n    Though our circuit may be unique in considering the\nduration of confinement relative to similarly situated\n\f                               19\nprisoners, duration itself is widely regarded as a crucial\nelement of the Sandin analysis. See, e.g., Wilkinson, 545 U.S.\nat 223–24 (considering indefinite duration of confinement and\ninfrequency of review when finding a liberty interest in\nplacement at a particularly harsh supermax prison); Harden-\nBey v. Rutter, 524 F.3d 789, 793 (6th Cir. 2008) (“[M]ost (if\nnot all) of our sister circuits have considered the nature of the\nmore-restrictive confinement and its duration in determining\nwhether it imposes an ‘atypical and significant hardship.’”).\nDuration is significant precisely because “especially harsh\nconditions endured for a brief interval and somewhat harsh\nconditions endured for a prolonged interval might both be\natypical.” Sealey v. Giltner, 197 F.3d 578, 586 (2d Cir.\n1999); see also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 686–87 (1978)\n(“[T]he length of confinement cannot be ignored in deciding\nwhether the confinement meets constitutional standards. A\nfilthy, overcrowded cell and a diet of ‘grue’ might be\ntolerable for a few days and intolerably cruel for weeks or\nmonths.”). Indeed, we have remanded a case for the sole\npurpose of determining whether “the duration of plaintiff’s\nadministrative segregation . . . impose[d] an atypical and\nsignificant hardship,” even when it was “apparent that the\nconditions of plaintiff’s restraint” could not be considered\natypical. Brown v. District of Columbia, 66 F. Supp. 2d 41,\n45–46 (D.D.C. 1999), on remand from Brown v. Plaut, 131\nF.3d 163 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n     We conclude, then, that the proper methodology for\nevaluating deprivation claims under Sandin is to consider (i)\nthe conditions of confinement relative to administrative\nsegregation, (ii) the duration of that confinement generally,\nand (iii) the duration relative to length of administrative\nsegregation routinely imposed on prisoners serving similar\nsentences. We also emphasize that a liberty interest can\n\f                              20\npotentially arise under less-severe conditions when the\ndeprivation is prolonged or indefinite.\n\n     Having shown how our circuit’s baseline differs from\nthat of our sister circuits, we now note another important\ndistinction between this case and the usual penal due process\ncase. Like Sandin, the vast majority of penal due process\ncases involve punitive deprivations, i.e., confinement or\nprivilege restriction for disciplinary purposes or while\npending the outcome of an investigation. See, e.g., Skinner v.\nCunningham, 430 F.3d 483, 487 (1st Cir. 2005) (“Skinner\nwas a prisoner serving a sentence for murder who had just\nkilled another inmate. It made perfect sense to isolate him\npending further investigation.”); Thomas v. Ramos, 130 F.3d\n754, 761 (7th Cir. 1997) (“Both temporary confinement and\ninvestigative status have been determined to be discretionary\nsegregation and do not implicate a liberty interest.”); Bazzetta\nv. McGinnis, 430 F.3d 795, 804–05 (6th Cir. 2005) (finding\nno liberty interest for prisoners subjected to a permanent ban\non visitation after two violations of the prison’s drug abuse\npolicy). While an inmate can be designated to a CMU for\nabusing the prison’s communication system, most were\ntransferred there to ensure prison officials could effectively\nmonitor their communications—not for any punitive purpose.\nIn this way, CMU designation is more analogous to\ntransferring an individual to a harsher prison based on gang\nstatus, for instance, than it is to disciplinary segregation.\n\n     We do not think this similarity ends the inquiry,\nhowever. We recognize the Court held in several pre-Sandin\ncases that “transfer of an inmate to less amenable and more\nrestrictive quarters for nonpunitive reasons is well within the\nterms of confinement ordinarily contemplated by a prison\nsentence.” Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 468. In Meachum v. Fano, for\nexample, the Court found no liberty interest even when the\n\f                              21\ntransfer would “place the prisoner in substantially more\nburdensome conditions [than] he had been experiencing”\nbecause such transfers “are made for a variety of reasons and\noften involve no more than informed predictions as to what\nwould best serve institutional security or the safety and\nwelfare of the inmate.” 427 U.S. 215, 225 (1976); see also id.\nat 228 (noting it does not matter if the transfer is “for\nwhatever reason or for no reason at all”). Circuit courts have\nalso consistently held that, “generally speaking, a prisoner has\nno liberty interest in his custodial classification.” Hernandez\nv. Velasquez, 522 F.3d 556, 562 (5th Cir. 2008). It follows\nthen that a classification like gang status—and any\ndeprivations that flow from it—cannot de facto constitute a\nliberty interest. See, e.g., id. at 563–64 (concluding lockdown\nto prevent gang-violence should be expected as an ordinary\nincidence of prison life); Adams v. Small, 542 F. App’x 567,\n568 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding no liberty interest in\nclassification status as a gang member); Perez v. Fed. Bureau\nof Prisons, 229 F. App’x 55, 58 (3d Cir. 2007) (“Because\nchanges in security classifications and limits on telephone\nusage are ordinary incidents of prison confinement,” no\nliberty interest existed).\n\n     This line of pre-Sandin precedent undermines appellants’\narguments.      But, most recently, the Supreme Court\nacknowledged that, while “the Constitution itself does not\ngive rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more\nadverse conditions of confinement,” a lesser liberty interest\n“in avoiding particular conditions of confinement may arise”\nif Sandin’s requirements are met. Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at\n221–22 (emphasis added). In Wilkinson, inmates who were\nassigned to Ohio’s Supermax Prison (OSP) on the basis of\neither their convictions (e.g., organized crime) or their\nengagement in specific conduct (e.g., leading a prison gang)\nchallenged their transfer as violating due process. The Court\n\f                                 22\nconcluded these inmates had a liberty interest in avoiding\ntransfer to OSP because OSP prohibited almost all human\ncontact and because placement there was indefinite, subject\nonly to annual review, and disqualified otherwise eligible\ninmates from parole consideration. See id. at 223–24.\n\n     A district court in our circuit also recently found a\nprisoner plausibly alleged harsh and atypical conditions\nbecause “he [had] been segregated from the general\npopulation for over six years” after he was formally classified\nas a “terrorist inmate.” Royer v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 933\nF. Supp. 2d 170, 190 (D.D.C. 2013). 9 The court concluded\nthat, even if the conditions alleged were “no more restrictive”\nthan administrative segregation, the complaint should survive\nbecause the conditions were permanent and intended to last\nfor the remainder of his twenty-year sentence—another\nsixteen-and-a-half years. Id.        In doing so, the court\ndistinguished Meachum as relating to the location of an\ninmate’s confinement rather than to the atypical conditions of\nthat confinement. See id. at 191. We agree. Although\nappellants’ deprivations are more akin to transfer based on a\nnon-punitive classification than disciplinary segregation, the\nSandin framework still guides our analysis of whether these\nparticular conditions can be considered “atypical and\nsignificant.” 10\n\n\n\n\n9\n   The case was never resolved on its merits as it was ultimately\ndismissed as moot after the motion to dismiss stage.\n10\n   The Tenth Circuit has also used its version of the Sandin analysis\nto evaluate whether inmates—transferred on the basis of their\nterrorism-related offenses—had a liberty interest in avoiding\ndesignation to the Administrative Maximum Prison (ADX). See\nRezaq, 677 F.3d at 1013.\n\f                              23\n                (2) Appellants’ Due Process Claim\n\n     Having examined this legal backdrop, we turn now to\nappellants’ specific claims. Whether a liberty interest exists\nhere is admittedly a close call. All parties agree CMUs are\nless extreme in terms of deprivation than administrative\nsegregation. Inmates in administrative segregation must\nremain in their cells for twenty-three hours a day; they are\nunable to hold jobs or access most educational opportunities.\nTheir possessions are also limited, and they can exercise only\none hour a day, five days a week. By contrast, CMU inmates\nare allowed in common spaces with other CMU inmates for\nsixteen hours a day. They have access to educational and\nprofessional opportunities, can keep as many possessions as\ninmates in the general population, and have no added\nrestrictions on exercise. Communication deprivations in\nadministrative segregation are also harsher: those inmates can\nmake only one fifteen-minute phone call per month and are\nlimited to four hours of non-contact visits per month. CMU\ninmates can make two fifteen-minute calls per week and are\nallowed two four-hour non-contact visits per month. We\ntherefore conclude CMU confinement involves significantly\nless deprivation than administrative segregation.\n\n     On the other hand, CMU designation is indefinite—\nlasting years in appellants’ case—and atypical because even\nthough several thousand inmates could be designated to\nCMUs based on their commitment offenses, only a handful\nare placed under these restrictions. The main tension, then, is\nhow atypicality, indefiniteness, and the harshness of the\ndepravations should be weighed.\n\n     We find three factors significant. Although CMU\ndesignation seems analogous to a classification, it is exercised\nselectively; the duration is indefinite and could be permanent;\n\f                              24\nthe deprivations—while not extreme—necessarily increase in\nseverity over time. An inmate placed in administrative\nsegregation may be wholly unable to communicate with his\nfamily or the outside world, but that restriction will generally\nonly last for a few weeks. Inmates housed in CMUs, by\ncontrast, may spend years denied contact with their loved\nones and with diminished ability to communicate with them.\nThe harms of these deprivations are heightened over time, as\nchildren grow older and relationships with the outside become\nmore difficult to maintain. Cf. Wilkerson v. Stalder, 639 F.\nSupp. 2d 654, 684 (M.D. La. 2007) (“With each passing day\nits effects are exponentially increased, just as surely as a\nsingle drop of water repeated endlessly will eventually bore\nthrough the hardest of stones.”).\n\n      Admittedly, Sandin’s metric seems more difficult to\napply where the transfer involves non-punitive classification\nrather than disciplinary segregation; and, as Wilkinson\nacknowledges, the difficulty of establishing an appropriate\nSandin baseline has led to widely disparate conclusions about\nwhat constitutes an atypical and significant hardship. 545\nU.S. at 223. However, as Wilkinson makes clear, Sandin did\nnot eliminate liberty interests created by prison regulations;\ninstead, it focused the inquiry on the condition itself. Sandin\ndetermines whether this lesser interest receives protection, but\nis silent as to its weight in the Mathews balance. Id. What we\nthink pushes CMU designation over the Sandin threshold is\nits selectivity and duration, not its severity, and BOP’s\nrecognition that some process—however de minimis—is due.\nThus, because we find the designation meets Sandin’s\nrequirements, we must consider the sufficiency of BOP’s\nresponse.\n\n    As a final note, we address the relevance of appellants’\ncontention that CMUs are viewed as an unusual designation\n\f                                25\nreserved primarily for Muslim individuals convicted of\nterrorism-related offenses—giving rise to a stigma analogous\nto sex-offender classification. Appellants rely on Neal v.\nShimoda, 131 F.3d 818 (9th Cir. 1997), and Chambers v.\nColorado Department of Corrections, 205 F.3d 1237 (10th\nCir. 2000), to support their claim. But, in those cases, sex-\noffender classification affected the length of the inmates’\nsentences. In Neal, parole eligibility was contingent on\nsuccessful completion of a lengthy treatment program, 131\nF.3d at 825, and, in Chambers, full good time credits were not\navailable to sex offenders, 205 F.3d at 1239. In contrast,\nCMU designation is not based on any formal status as a\n“terrorist” and not every CMU inmate is associated with\nterrorist activities. Additionally, CMU designation has no\nbearing on the length of an inmate’s sentence. Thus, we do\nnot find stigma to be relevant in this context.11\n\n                           B. Process Due\n\n     We must next examine the question whether the\nassignment process used by the government is adequate. The\ndistrict court never reached this question because it concluded\n\n11\n   Amicus Curiae Seton Hall Center for Social Justice also alleges a\nliberty interest can be found under the Supreme Court’s “stigma\nplus” test. To prevail on this claim, appellants must show the\ngovernment is “the source of the defamatory allegations” and the\nresulting stigma involved “some tangible change of status vis-à-vis\nthe government.” Doe v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 753 F.2d 1092,\n1108–09 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Most important here, the reputation-\ntarnishing statement must be false. See Vega v. Lantz, 596 F.3d 77,\n81–82 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding no viable “stigma plus” argument for\nplaintiff’s sex-offender classification because he had in fact been\nconvicted of a sex offense). All three of these appellants were\nconvicted of terrorism-related activity. They therefore cannot\nsatisfy this test’s defamation requirement.\n\f                               26\nno constitutional liberty interest existed. Aref, 2015 WL\n3749621, at *9. Although both sides partially briefed the\nissue, appellants assert the deficiencies detailed in their briefs\nwere “but a small piece of the voluminous and painstakingly\ndetailed evidence [they] provided to the District Court to\ndemonstrate the risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty.”\nAppellant Reply Br. 22. We therefore remand this issue for\nresolution on a further record. We note, however, that\nappellants are challenging fundamentally predictive\njudgments in an area where administrators are given broad\ndiscretion and the government’s legitimate interests in\nmaintaining CMUs must be accorded substantial weight.\nBecause the cardinal principle in due process analysis is\nflexibility—i.e., attention to relevant context and\nconsideration of competing interests—only minimal process\nis likely due. See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. at 472.\n\n                               V.\n\n     We turn next to appellant Jayyousi’s First Amendment\nretaliation claim against Leslie Smith, then-Chief of BOP’s\nCTU, in his official capacity. Jayyousi alleges that Smith\nretaliated against him by denying his transfer out of the CMU\nin 2011 because of a sermon he gave as part of a Muslim\nprayer meeting in August 2008 while housed in the Terre\nHaute CMU. The government counters Jayyousi’s language\ncould reasonably have been viewed as an attempt to radicalize\nfellow Muslims, amounting to a potential security threat. To\nprevail on his retaliation claim, Jayyousi must show: “(1) he\nengaged in conduct protected under the First Amendment; (2)\nthe defendant took some retaliatory action sufficient to deter a\nperson of ordinary firmness in plaintiff’s position from\nspeaking again; and (3) a causal link between the exercise of a\nconstitutional right and the adverse action taken against him.”\nBanks v. York, 515 F. Supp. 2d 89, 111 (D.D.C. 2007).\n\f                                 27\nBecause Jayyousi’s claim fails at the first prong, we need not\nreach the final two inquiries.\n\n     While constitutional protections do not disappear at the\nprison gate, it is well established that “a prison inmate retains\n[only] those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent\nwith his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological\nobjectives of the corrections system.” Pell v. Procunier, 417\nU.S. 817, 822 (1974). To evaluate whether Jayyousi’s\nconduct was protected by the First Amendment, we look to\nthe factors laid out by the Supreme Court in Turner v. Safley:\n(i) whether there was a “valid, rational connection between\nthe prison [action] and the legitimate governmental interest\nput forward to justify it;” (ii) whether “alternative means of\nexercising the right . . . remain open to prison inmates;” (iii)\n“the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the\nallocation of prison resources generally;” and (iv) whether\nany “ready alternative” existed. 482 U.S. 78, 89–90 (1987). 12\nThese factors, taken together, allow us to assess whether the\n\n12\n   The district court considered only the first Turner factor, finding\n“it [made] little sense” to inquire into the subsequent factors after\nfinding for the government on the first. See Aref, 2015 WL\n3749621, at *11. While the first factor is widely recognized as the\nmost important, precedent indicates all four factors must be\nweighed. See, e.g., Lindell v. Frank, 377 F.3d 655, 657 (7th Cir.\n2004) (stating “[t]here are four factors that courts must consider in\ndetermining whether a prison regulation is constitutional”);\nJacklovich v. Simmons, 392 F.3d 420, 427 (10th Cir. 2004) (“The\ndistrict court erred in not considering the remaining three Turner\nfactors in the context of summary judgment.”). At least one court\nhas even held a regulation violated the First Amendment because\nall but the first factor cut against the prison. See Lindell, 377 F.3d\nat 658–60. The district court’s failure to consider the last three\nfactors can be remedied on appeal.\n\f                               28\nchallenged conduct was “reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interests.” Id. at 89. Our circuit has cast this\n“reasonable relation” test as “very similar,” if not identical, to\nrational basis review. Amatel v. Reno, 156 F.3d 192, 198–99\n(D.C. Cir. 1998). This flexible standard “ensures the ability\nof corrections officials to anticipate security problems and to\nadopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of\nprison administration.” O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482\nU.S. 342, 349 (1987).\n\n     As an initial note, appellants make much of what, in their\neyes, amounted to “excessive deference” on the part of the\ndistrict court to Smith’s justifications for his actions. See\nAppellant Br. 36 (“When applying this already deferential\nTurner standard, the court is not meant to also defer to a\ndefendant’s assertion that there is, in fact, a valid, rational\nconnection between his actions and the legitimate\ngovernmental interest.”). Appellants further emphasize the\nlegal standard for summary judgment, which requires courts\nto draw all reasonable inferences in their favor. See id. at 39–\n40. The interplay between Turner and the summary judgment\nstandard is admittedly murky. But the Supreme Court in\nBeard v. Banks provided some guidance:\n\n       We must distinguish between evidence of\n       disputed facts and disputed matters of\n       professional judgment. In respect to the latter, our\n       inferences must accord deference to the views of\n       prison authorities. Unless a prisoner can point to\n       sufficient evidence regarding such issues of\n       judgment to allow him to prevail on the merits, he\n       cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage.\n\n548 U.S. 521, 530 (2006). But the Court also cautioned that\nTurner “requires prison authorities to show more than a\n\f                              29\nformalistic logical connection between a regulation and a\npenological objective.” Id. at 536. We agree with the Eighth\nCircuit that “[a] ‘reasonableness’ standard is not toothless.”\nSalaam v. Lockhart, 905 F.2d 1168, 1171 (8th Cir. 1990).\n\n     With these principles in mind, we turn now to the first\nTurner factor. This factor, which “looms especially large,”\nasks whether the prison’s actions bear a rational connection to\nany legitimate penological interest. Amatel, 156 F.3d at 196.\nWe agree with the district court that Smith could rationally\nhave interpreted Jayyousi’s language during the prayer\nmeeting as an attempt to “radicalize” other prisoners, thereby\nconstituting a continued security risk. Although appellants\nclaim Smith exaggerated the contents of the remarks, several\nportions rationally could have been considered troubling,\nparticularly when Jayyousi stated “you are here because you\nare Muslim, not because you are a criminal” and cautioned “it\nis not U.S. versus Jayyousi; it is U.S. versus Islam.” J.A. 835.\nJayyousi also asserted the CMU was created from evil, and\nthat the suffering faced by Muslim inmates is “why we\nmartyr.” J.A. 836. Prison staff were concerned about the\nsermon at the time it was given, as evidenced by the several\nemails and follow-ups that ensued. J.A. 1292, 1296, 1298,\n1300, 1302. That Jayyousi was cleared of any wrongdoing\nthrough the prison disciplinary process does not render it\nunreasonable for Smith, as the head of BOP’s CTU, to\nconsider the content of Jayyousi’s statements in evaluating his\nCMU placement—especially the portions that indicated\nJayyousi may have been continuing some of the same actions\nthat led to his incarceration. The first factor weighs in favor\nof the government.\n\n     The second Turner factor asks whether prisoners have\nany alternative means of exercising the right at stake. The\nright at issue “must be viewed sensibly and expansively.”\n\f                              30\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 417 (1989). Turner and\nO’Lone are particularly instructive. In Turner, the Court “did\nnot require that prisoners be afforded other means of\ncommunicating with inmates at other institutions, nor did . . .\nO’Lone require that there be alternative means of attending\nthe [Muslim] religious ceremony.” Id. Instead, the Turner\nCourt held “it was sufficient if other means of expression . . .\nremained available” and, in O’Lone, it was sufficient “if\nprisoners were permitted to participate in other Muslim\nreligious ceremonies.” Id. at 418. Here, the second factor is\neasily satisfied; Jayyousi had other means of communicating\nhis dissatisfaction still available to him, and he was not\nprohibited from giving similar sermons in the future.\n\n     The third Turner factor looks to the impact\naccommodation of the asserted right will have on guards and\nother inmates in the prison. It is unclear, in this context, how\nBOP could have otherwise accommodated Jayyousi, as he\nwas allowed to pray and free to lead similar prayer meetings\nin the future. Appellants’ view of “accommodation” would\nrequire Smith to entirely disregard the content of Jayyousi’s\nsermon when evaluating whether he should remain in the\nCMU. But the government is not required to disregard\npotentially relevant information when making that sort of\nsecurity assessment. Appellants additionally argue that\nJayyousi’s sermon did not affect allocation of prison\nresources, but the number of emails generated and the need to\nconduct the disciplinary hearing undermine that assertion.\n\n    Finally, under the fourth factor, we must consider\nwhether Smith had any ready alternatives. Again we find the\ngovernment’s position persuasive: the CMU exists precisely\nbecause inmates who present security risks require heightened\nmonitoring. Given that charge, Smith had no real alternative\nbut to consider all information available about Jayyousi—\n\f                                31\nincluding the language used during the prayer meeting. And\nonce Smith determined continued monitoring was necessary,\nthe only option available to the government (except, perhaps\nprolonged confinement in administrative segregation) was to\nkeep Jayyousi in the CMU.\n\n     At bottom, appellants are challenging a “disputed matter\nof professional judgment” rather than disputed matters of fact.\nWe do not require government officials to be perfect in their\njudgment, merely reasonable. Because all four Turner factors\nuniformly indicate Smith’s actions here were reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate security interest, we affirm the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                               VI.\n\n     Finally, we turn to Jayyousi and McGowan’s claims\nagainst Smith in his individual capacity. Appellants seek\n“compensatory and punitive damages” for injuries they\nsuffered during their purportedly retaliatory placements in the\nCMUs. These injuries include the denial of job-related\nprogramming, the stigma of being designated to a “terrorist”\nunit, the prolonged deprivation of First Amendment rights to\npolitical speech, and the undue damage to familial\nrelationships caused by the CMUs’ unique communication\nrestrictions. But before we address the availability of\ndamages in this context, we must answer a threshold\njurisdictional question: whether these individual-capacity\nclaims survive Smith’s death in March 2015. 13\n13\n  In its briefing, the government acknowledged “[t]here is . . . no\ndefendant to respond to the individual-capacity claims, and\ngovernment counsel does not represent any party with respect to\nthose claims.” Appellee Br. 1–2. However, the government\ndecided to respond to appellants’ claims against Smith as amicus\ncuriae since “the United States has an interest in the proper\n\f                                 32\n                             A. Mootness\n\n     Both sides agree state law determines whether a Bivens\naction survives the death of a party. See Haggard v. Stevens,\nNo. 2:09–cv–1144, 2010 WL 3658809, at *3–*6 (S.D. Ohio,\nSept. 14, 2010) (undertaking an exhaustive survey of law in\nthis area and concluding questions of survivorship are\noverwhelmingly decided by looking to state law), aff’d 683\nF.3d 714 (6th Cir. 2012). They do not agree, however, about\nwhich state’s law should govern. We have several options:\nWest Virginia law (where Smith was domiciled and worked),\nIndiana law (where the Terre Haute CMU is located), or\nIllinois law (where the Marion CMU is located). The starting\npoint for assessing which state’s law should apply is the law\nof the forum state. See Haggard v. Stevens, 683 F.3d 714,\n718 (6th Cir. 2012); see also Malone v. Corr. Corp. of Am.,\n553 F.3d 540, 542 (7th Cir. 2009) (“[I]t is a familiar principle\nthat federal courts use the whole law of the forum state,\nincluding that state’s choice-of-law rules.”).\n\n     The District of Columbia employs the “governmental\ninterest” test to determine which state’s law to apply. See\nRaflo v. United States, 157 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2001).\nThis test involves a two-step inquiry: we begin by\n“identifying the governmental policies underlying the\napplicable law” and then “determin[e] which state’s policy\nwould be most advanced by having its law applied to the facts\nof this case.” Id. Courts use four factors to determine which\nstate’s policy is most advanced by application of its laws: “(1)\nthe place where the injury occurred; (2) the place where the\nconduct causing the injury occurred; (3) the domicile . . . of\n\n\nresolution of constitutional claims against its employees.” Id. at 2.\nThe government is entitled to file as amicus without the consent of\nthe parties or leave of court. See 29 C.F.R. § 18.24.\n\f                              33\nthe parties; and (4) the place where the relationship is\ncentered.” Id.\n\n     We need not determine which state’s law applies with\nrespect to survivorship, however, because the result is the\nsame under all three—appellants’ claims are not extinguished\nby Smith’s death. See Ind. Code § 34-9-3-1(a); 755 Ill.\nComp. Stat. 5/27-6; W. Va. Code § 55-7-8a(a). We proceed\nto the merits.\n\n                 B. Damages Under The PLRA\n\n     Jayyousi and McGowan contend they are entitled to\ncompensation under the PLRA for a variety of injuries: loss of\neducational opportunity in the form of release preparation\nprogramming, reputational harm, violation of their First\nAmendment rights, and lasting harm to their familial\nrelationships. The PLRA—in a provision entitled “Limitation\non Recovery”—states: “No Federal civil action may be\nbrought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other\ncorrectional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered\nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.”\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) (emphasis added). We are thus faced\nwith an issue of first impression for this circuit: whether\ninjuries that are allegedly neither mental nor emotional are\ncompensable under the PLRA without a prior showing of\nphysical injury. Our circuit has addressed Section 1997e(e)\nonce before in Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342\n(D.C. Cir. 1998). The government and district court both\ncontend Davis controls this issue. We disagree. In Davis, the\nplaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages for an\nalleged violation of his privacy after a prison official opened\nhis sealed medical records and disclosed their contents\nwithout his consent. See id. at 1345. While the Davis court\nassumed without deciding that this intrusion on his privacy\n\f                                34\namounted to a constitutional violation, it was careful to point\nout that Davis “alleged resulting emotional and mental\ndistress, but no other injury” when it held his claims for\ncompensatory and punitive damages were foreclosed by the\nPLRA. 14 Id. (emphasis added). Our circuit has therefore\nnever squarely addressed whether actual injuries that are\nneither mental nor emotional are precluded under the PLRA\nabsent a showing of physical injury. Language in Davis and\nfrom other circuits confirms this distinction. See, e.g., id. at\n1349 (“[Section] 1997e(e) precludes claims for emotional\ninjury without any prior physical injury, regardless of the\nstatutory or constitutional basis of the legal wrong” (emphasis\nadded)); Cassidy v. Ind. Dep’t of Corr., 199 F.3d 374, 375–77\n(7th Cir. 2000) (dismissing claims for mental and emotional\nharm stemming from an underlying constitutional violation\nbut allowing plaintiff to pursue claims for loss of opportunity,\nloss of participation in prison activities, loss of access to\nprison programs and services, and loss of freedom of\nmovement and social context stemming from the same\nviolation).\n\n     Circuits have split over the applicability of Section\n1997e(e) to claims involving constitutional violations but no\nphysical injury. A majority has held that Section 1997e(e)\nprecludes compensatory damages for any claim that does not\ninclude physical harm. 15 In doing so, these courts focus on\nthe type of injury asserted. See, e.g., Thompson v. Carter, 284\n\n14\n    But because the Davis court found other forms of relief\n(specifically injunctive and declaratory) were still available under\nSection 1997e(e), the court upheld the constitutionality of the\nstatute under rational basis review. See id. at 1346, 1349.\n15\n    Like Davis, these circuits sidestep concerns about Section\n1997e(e) unconstitutionally foreclosing any relief by holding\ninjunctive and declaratory relief remain available regardless of\nwhether the plaintiff can show physical injury.\n\f                              35\nF.3d 411, 417–18 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding a “plaintiff cannot\nrecover damages for mental or emotional injury for a\nconstitutional violation in the absence of a showing of actual\nphysical injury”); Brooks v. Warden, 800 F.3d 1295, 1298\n(11th Cir. 2015) (“Because [plaintiff] has not alleged any\nphysical injury resulting from his hospital stay, under the\n[PLRA], he cannot recover compensatory or punitive\ndamages” for his Eighth Amendment claim). These cases\nnecessarily imply a constitutional violation, absent physical\nharm, is necessarily a type of “mental or emotional injury.”\nSee, e.g., Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 250 (3d Cir. 2000)\n(considering plaintiff’s claim of a First Amendment violation\nand concluding “the only actual injury that could form the\nbasis for the award he seeks would be mental and/or\nemotional,” thus barring his claim); Searles v. Van Bebber,\n251 F.3d 869, 876 (10th Cir. 2001) (“The statute limits the\nremedies available, regardless of the rights asserted, if the\nonly injuries are mental or emotional.”).\n\n     Several circuits have taken the opposite approach. These\ncourts view alleged constitutional violations as a type of\nintangible harm wholly apart from mental or emotional injury.\nSee, e.g., King v. Zamiara, 788 F.3d 207, 213 (6th Cir. 2015),\ncert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 794 (2016) (“The statute provides that\na prisoner may not bring a civil action for mental or\nemotional injury . . . . It says nothing about claims brought to\nredress constitutional injuries, which are distinct from mental\nand emotional injuries.”); Robinson v. Page, 170 F.3d 747,\n749 (7th Cir. 1999) (“If the suit contains separate claims,\nneither involving physical injury, and in one the prisoner\nclaims damages for mental or emotional suffering and in the\nother damages for some other type of injury, the first claim is\nbarred by the statute but the second is unaffected.”).\n\f                                36\n     Both approaches involve some degree of slicing-and-\ndicing claims: one by injury pled and one by relief requested.\nThis is best illustrated by example. Take a prisoner who has\nalleged a credible violation of his First Amendment right to\nfree exercise but made no showing of physical harm. Rather\nthan dismiss his entire action, the majority view of Section\n1997e(e) would bar his claim for compensatory damages but\nallow his claims for injunctive relief and punitive damages to\nproceed. The minority view, on the other hand, would look to\nthe type of injury alleged—if, say, the prisoner claimed\nmental anguish in addition to the substantive constitutional\nviolation, then the first claim would be barred while the\nsecond would be eligible for compensatory damages. For the\nreasons laid out below, we are convinced this narrower\nreading of the PLRA is the proper one.\n\n     While Section 1997e(e) “may well present the highest\nconcentration of poor drafting in the smallest number of\nwords in the entire United States Code,” John Boston, The\nPrison Litigation Reform Act: The New Face of Court\nStripping, 67 BROOK. L. REV. 429, 434 (2001), we\nnonetheless begin with the statute’s plain language. See, e.g.,\nConsumer Prod. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447\nU.S. 102, 108 (1980).             The government’s preferred\ninterpretation would render the phrase “mental and emotional\ninjury” superfluous. Had Congress intended to graft a\nphysical-injury requirement onto every single claim, the\nstatute could simply have provided: “No Federal civil action\nmay be brought by a prisoner . . . for any injury suffered while\nin custody without a prior showing of physical injury.” See\nZamiara, 788 F.3d at 213; Robinson, 170 F.3d at 749; Amaker\nv. Haponik, No. 98 CIV. 2663, 1999 WL 76798, at *7\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1999) (“If Congress had intended to apply\n§ 1997e(e)’s restriction to all federal civil suits by prisoners, it\ncould easily have done so simply by dropping the qualifying\n\f                               37\nlanguage ‘for mental or emotional injury.’”). The “mental\nand emotional” language is significant precisely because\nprisoners can allege types of intangible injury that fall outside\nthat ambit.\n\n     Courts that advocate the opposite interpretation of\nSection 1997e(e) claim the provision’s “clear mandate” is a\nfocus on the type of injury pled rather than the nature of the\nunderlying right. See, e.g., Searles, 251 F.3d at 876. The\nTenth Circuit, for instance, cautioned the statute’s plain\nlanguage forecloses “divorc[ing]” the underlying substantive\nviolation from the resulting injury. Id. But our reading does\nno such thing; the focus remains on the type of injury alleged,\nwith an understanding that plaintiffs can allege intangible\nharms that are neither mental nor emotional, i.e., not every\nnon-physical injury is by default a mental or emotional injury.\n\n     In the PLRA context, many of our sister circuits have\nawarded compensatory damages for non-mental and non-\nemotional injuries. See, e.g., Rowe v. Shake, 196 F.3d 778,\n781 (7th Cir. 1999) (“A deprivation of First Amendment\nrights standing alone is a cognizable injury.”); Cassidy, 199\nF.3d at 375–77 (allowing claims of loss of access to prison\nprograms and services); Brooks v. Andolina, 826 F.2d 1266,\n1269–70 (3d Cir. 1987) (finding a prisoner entitled to\ncompensatory damages for his unconstitutional placement in\npunitive segregation including for the loss of visiting, phone,\nand library privileges). Analogous Supreme Court and circuit\nprecedent supports the view that there can be real harms\nseparate and apart from mental or emotional injury. For\ninstance, in Carey v. Piphus, the Court held that a plaintiff is\neligible to recover damages under Section 1983 if he can\ndemonstrate “some actual, if intangible, injury” caused by a\nconstitutional violation. 435 U.S. 247, 264 (1978). Similarly,\nthis court in Hobson v. Wilson instructed “intangible interests\n\f                              38\nmust be compensated” as long as they can be shown with\n“sufficient certainty.” 737 F.2d 1, 62 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The\nHobson court even enumerated some examples of “First\nAmendment compensable rights” separate from any common-\nlaw mental or emotional harm, such as the restriction of an\ninmate’s access to books. Id.\n\n      Indeed, courts frequently allow plaintiffs in Section 1983\nactions to recover damages for constitutional violations that\nfall outside the domain of common-law injuries. See, e.g.,\nSimmons v. Cook, 154 F.3d 805, 808–09 (8th Cir. 1998)\n(affirming an award of compensatory damages for Eighth\nAmendment claim of paraplegic prisoners unconstitutionally\nplaced in solitary confinement); Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit\nAuth., 124 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1997) (finding damages to\nbe an appropriate remedy for the harm caused by fabrication\nof evidence). Courts have also consistently treated the loss of\nliberty as an independently cognizable injury, separate from\nany mental or emotional harm. See, e.g., Heck v. Humphrey,\n512 U.S. 477, 484 (1994) (“[A] successful malicious\nprosecution plaintiff may recover, in addition to general\ndamages, compensation for . . . loss of time and deprivation of\nthe society.”); Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 216, 277 (D.C.\nCir. 1977) (affirming damage award for, among other relief,\ncompensation for “the duration of loss of liberty” in a Fourth\nAmendment case); Kerman v. City of New York, 374 F.3d 93,\n128 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding a plaintiff is “entitled to be\ncompensated for [his] loss of liberty” “independently of his\nclaims of physical, mental, emotional, or economic injury”).\nWe therefore conclude there exists a universe of injuries that\nare neither mental nor emotional and for which plaintiffs can\nrecover compensatory damages under the PLRA.\n\n   Our holding also comports with the purpose of the\nPLRA, as expressed in its legislative history. The Act’s\n\f                                39\npassage was precipitated by an increase in prison litigation,\nmuch of it frivolous.16 Examples cited by PLRA proponents\nranged from due process cases alleging injuries like a\ndefective haircut to, most famously, an inmate filing a cruel\nand unusual punishment claim after he was given chunky\nrather than creamy peanut butter. See 141 CONG. REC. 27,042\n(1995) (statement of Sen. Bob Dole). But members of\nCongress also made it clear that the PLRA was not meant to\nbar serious, potentially meritorious claims. See id. at 26,553\n(statement of Sen. Jon Kyl) (“Prisoners still have the right to\nseek legal redress for meritorious claims . . . .”); see also id. at\n27,044 (statement of Sen. Strom Thurmond) (“This\namendment will allow meritorious claims to be filed, but\ngives the judge broader discretion to prevent frivolous and\nmalicious lawsuits filed by prison inmates.”).\n\n     Indeed, we find it hard to believe that Congress intended\nto afford virtual immunity to prison officials even when they\ncommit blatant constitutional violations, as long as no\nphysical blow is dealt. 17 It is especially difficult to see how\n\n16\n   Notably, although there was a large increase in the absolute\nnumber of cases filed from 1975 to 1994 (6,606 cases to 39,065\ncases, respectively), Congressional debate failed to account for the\nexponential growth in the prison population in the interim. The rate\nof inmate filings actually dropped by approximately seventeen\npercent during that time period. Jennifer Winslow, Comment, The\nPrison Litigation Reform Act’s Physical Injury Requirement Bars\nMeritorious Lawsuits: Was It Meant To?, 49 UCLA L. REV. 1655,\n1662–63 (2002).\n17\n   As noted above, circuits that have adopted the broader reading of\nSection 1997e(e)’s bar support the provision’s constitutionality by\nemphasizing the availability of alternative forms of relief: namely,\ninjunctive or declaratory relief, punitive damages, and nominal\ndamages. We need not consider the constitutionality question here\nbut simply note the illusory nature, in practice, of such relief.\n\f                                40\nviolations of inmates’ First Amendment rights could ever be\nvindicated, given the unlikelihood of physical harm in that\ncontext. Against that backdrop, and a legislative record\nindicating an intention to still allow awards for meritorious\nclaims, we believe our reading of Section 1997e(e) best aligns\nwith the purposes of the PLRA.\n\n      We note also that the PLRA contains several other\nmechanisms to curb the filing of frivolous suits—making it\neven less likely Congress intended the physical-injury\nrequirement to bar claims for every serious but non-mental or\nemotional harm. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), (d) (requiring the\nexhaustion of administrative remedies and capping attorneys’\nfees for successful claims at 150 percent of damages); 28\nU.S.C. § 1915(b)(1), (g) (compelling personal payment of\ninitial filing fees and imposing a limitation on filing in forma\npauperis after having three suits previously dismissed). And,\nof course, courts have always had the power to weed out\nclaims that lack merit at earlier pleading stages, preserving\njudicial resources. Finally, we point out one additional\nlimitation relevant to appellants’ claims here. Even when a\nparty pleads an injury that is neither mental nor emotional,\nthat harm still must “be shown with sufficient certainty to\n\nInjunctive relief is commonly moot by the time a case is heard and\ncannot provide relief for past harms. Punitive damages are never\nawarded as a matter of right, and the standard is understandably\nhigh—requiring evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of\nothers. See Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 51–52 (1983). Finally,\nnominal damages do little to deter repetition of the illegal conduct\nand do not provide any compensation for actual harms suffered. Cf.\nButz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 506 (1978) (“In situations of\nabuse, an action for damages against the responsible individual can\nbe an important means of vindicating constitutional guarantees.”);\nsee Doe v. District of Columbia, 697 F.2d 1115, 1124 (D.C. Cir.\n1983).\n\f                               41\navoid damages based either on pure speculation or the so-\ncalled inherent value of the rights violated.” Hobson, 737\nF.2d at 62. When “no value [can] reasonably be placed on the\nparticular injury demonstrated,” then the plaintiff is entitled\nonly to nominal damages. Id. at 63; see also Carey, 435 U.S.\nat 264 (noting plaintiffs could recover compensatory damages\n“for racial discrimination, the denial of voting rights and the\ndenial of Fourth Amendment rights” assuming they could\nprove “some actual, if intangible, injury”); Kerman, 374 F.3d\nat 130 (“The present case does not involve . . . an attempt to\nvindicate an abstract societal interest. Rather, it involves an\nanything-but-abstract physical detention. And although a\ngiven person’s loss of time may be difficult to evaluate in\nterms of dollars, his loss of liberty is not just ‘virtually\ncertain’ to occur; it is inseparable from the detention itself.”).\n\n     Having concluded a prisoner may recover compensatory\ndamages under the PLRA if he can show an actual injury—\nseparate from any mental or emotional harm—for which\ndamages can be reasonably ascertained, we note the vast\nmajority of circuits—including the majority of those that have\nadopted the broader application of Section 1997e(e)—agree\nthe provision does not limit the availability of punitive\ndamages provided a proper showing is made. See, e.g.,\nSearles, 251 F.3d at 879–80; Allah, 226 F.3d at 252–53;\nCassidy, 199 F.3d at 376–77; Carter, 284 F.3d at 418. Our\ncircuit has uniquely held that punitive damages are\nunavailable to plaintiffs who plead only mental or emotional\ninjury, without a showing of physical harm. See Davis, 158\nF.3d at 1348 (“Amicus argues that because punitive damages\nare awarded to punish the tortfeasor rather than to compensate\nthe victim, they are not embraced by § 1997e(e). But\n§ 1997e(e) draws no such distinction. It simply prevents suits\n‘for’ mental injury without prior physical injury.”). We have\nno occasion to reconsider that holding here. Instead, we\n\f                                42\nconstrue Davis narrowly and hold appellants who allege\nactual harms that are neither mental nor emotional are entitled\nto punitive damages if they can show the defendant’s conduct\nwas “motivated by evil motive or intent” or “involve[d]\nreckless or callous indifference to the federally protected\nrights of others.” Wade, 461 U.S. at 56.\n\n     Finally, every circuit, regardless of its interpretation of\nSection 1997e(e), agrees that nominal damages are available\nin this context. See Carter, 284 F.3d at 418 (listing cases).\nOur court declined to reach this issue in Davis because it\nfound the plaintiff failed to sufficiently plead nominal\ndamages. See Davis, 158 F.3d at 1349. The district court\nhere also concluded these appellants waived their claim to\nnominal damages by failing to “specifically plead” them in\ntheir complaint. Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 149. In doing so,\nthe court below relied entirely on our language in Davis.\nThere, the court felt it could not “strain[] to find inferences\nthat [were] not available on the face of the complaint or the\nbriefs submitted” because “Davis never sought nominal\ndamages” nor did his “submissions to the court ever mention\na claim to nominal relief.” Davis, 158 F.3d at 1349. But\nappellants here made a specific request for nominal damages\nin their opposition to the government’s motion to dismiss.\nBrief for Plaintiffs at 36, Aref, et al. v. Holder, et al., No. 10-\ncv-539 (D.D.C. Mar. 19, 2013), ECF No. 102. Moreover, the\nplaintiff in Davis only requested compensatory and punitive\ndamages; his pleadings did not contain any catch-all prayer\nfor relief. See Complaint, Davis v. District of Columbia, No.\n97-cv-00092 (D.D.C. Jan. 14, 1997), ECF No. 1. By contrast,\nthese appellants included a broad prayer for relief in their\ncomplaint. See Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 149 (“Plaintiffs\nrespectfully request the Court . . . [o]rder such other relief as\nthis Court deems just and proper.”). We therefore find the\nreasoning in Davis inapt.\n\f                              43\n     The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure even indicate\n“[e]very other final judgment should grant the relief to which\neach party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that\nrelief in its pleadings.” FED R. CIV. P. 54. Thus, we conclude\nappellants here have made out a sufficient claim for nominal\ndamages. And we join our sister circuits in holding that an\ninmate who cannot make out “sufficiently certain” claims for\ncompensatory damages is entitled to nominal damages,\nprovided he proves an injury occurred. See Memphis Comm.\nSch. Dis. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 308 n.11 (1986)\n(“[N]ominal damages . . . are the appropriate means of\n‘vindicating’ rights whose deprivation has not caused actual,\nprovable injury.”).\n\n     Overall, then, we conclude appellants are eligible to seek\ncompensatory, punitive, and nominal damages under Section\n1997e(e). They have asserted the following injuries: the\ndisadvantage of being denied essential reintegration\nprogramming provided by BOP; the stigma of being\ndesignated to facilities known as “terrorist units;” the\nprolonged deprivation of First Amendment rights to political\nspeech and activity; and the undue damage to primary family\nrelationships. The district court held these harms to be too\nspeculative and abstract to provide a basis for compensatory\nor punitive damages. See Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 148–49.\nWe need not evaluate these injuries, however, because we\nconclude infra that Smith is entitled to qualified immunity.\nWe similarly decline to remand to the district court to\nconsider—in the first instance—whether nominal damages\nwould be appropriate.\n\n                     C. Qualified Immunity\n\n     Having concluded the PLRA does not bar appellants’\nclaims, we turn at last to the question whether Smith is\n\f                               44\nentitled to qualified immunity. Appellants can prevail only if\nthey show “(1) that the official violated a statutory or\nconstitutional right, and (2) that the right was ‘clearly\nestablished’ at the time of the challenged conduct.” Ashcroft\nv. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 735 (2011). For a right to have been\n“clearly established,” it must have been “clear to a reasonable\nofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001). The\nSupreme Court has cautioned us not to define the right at too\nhigh a level of generality; instead, we must examine the right\nin its “particularized” context. See Reichle v. Howards, 132\nS. Ct. 2088, 2094 (2012). Jayyousi and McGowan allege\ntheir continued confinement to the CMU (and, in McGowan’s\ncase, his redesignation) was retaliatory action taken in\nviolation of the First Amendment. At the outset, we note “the\nright in question [here] is not the general right to be free from\nretaliation for one’s speech, but the more specific right to be\nfree” from retaliation in this particular, penological context.\nId.\n\n     Especially in the context of prison security, we cannot—\nand do not—require public officials to be perfect in their\nassessments. Indeed, qualified immunity is intended to allow\n“government officials breathing room to make reasonable but\nmistaken judgments about open legal questions.” Lane v.\nFranks, 134 S. Ct. 2369, 2381 (2014); see also Malley v.\nBriggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986) (observing that qualified\nimmunity “provides ample protection to all but the plainly\nincompetent or those who knowingly violate the law”). We\nevaluate appellants’ arguments against this backdrop.\n\n     With respect to Jayyousi’s claim, as previously\ndiscussed, appellants have failed to make out an adequate case\nthat his First Amendment rights were violated—much less\nthat it would have been clear to any reasonable officer in\n\f                              45\nSmith’s position that denying Jayyousi’s transfer request on\nthe basis of his sermon given during the prayer meeting would\nviolate the First Amendment.           McGowan’s claims are\nsimilarly untenable. Appellants point first to McGowan’s\ninitial placement in the CMU in 2008, contending it was\nretaliation for protected political speech. But Smith had\nseveral reasons for recommending the placement; most\nnotably, that McGowan’s conviction involved domestic\nterrorist activity and that he continued to communicate with\nindividuals outside the prison involved in extreme\nenvironmental advocacy. While the First Amendment may\nprotect this sort of speech and association generally, those\nprotections are less robust in the prison context. See Pell, 417\nU.S. at 822 (“[L]awful incarceration brings about the\nnecessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and\nrights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying\nour penal system.”). Moreover, placement in the CMU did\nnot force McGowan to give up all methods of\ncommunication; it merely limited the frequency and amount.\nEven assuming McGowan could make out a First Amendment\nviolation (an unlikely prospect), he certainly cannot show\nSmith violated any clearly established right when he\nrecommended designation to the CMU.\n\n     Appellants then point to Smith’s decision to redesignate\nMcGowan to the CMU in 2011, alleging it was illegal\nretaliation for McGowan’s exercise of protected speech.\nBut—after being returned to the general population—\nMcGowan asked his wife to have his attorney send him law-\nenforcement sensitive documents, in an apparent attempt to\ncircumvent communications monitoring. It was reasonable\nfor an officer in Smith’s position to consider this attempted\nend-run around the prison’s monitoring systems when\ndeciding whether redesignation would be prudent. Yet again,\neven if McGowan could make out a First Amendment\n\f                               46\nviolation here, he cannot meet the high bar of showing an\nofficial in Smith’s position would have known his actions\nviolated a clearly established right. Smith is therefore entitled\nto qualified immunity on all of appellants’ individual-capacity\nclaims. 18\n\n                              VII.\n\n     In sum, we hold appellants’ claims were not mooted by\ntheir transfer out of the CMU and they have a liberty interest\nin avoiding transfer into the CMU. We therefore reverse the\ngrant of summary judgment on this claim and remand to the\ndistrict court to determine whether the government’s\nprocedures comport with due process as applied to\nappellants.\n\n     With respect to Jayyousi’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaim, we hold he failed to establish any constitutional\nviolation and so cannot prevail. Appellants’ individual-\ncapacity claims against Lieutenant Smith survive his death\nand, moreover, constitute claims for actual though intangible\nharms that are neither mental nor emotional. Although these\nclaims are eligible to be brought under the PLRA, they too\nfail because Smith is entitled to qualified immunity. For the\nforegoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on both these claims.\n                                                  So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n18\n   Because we hold Smith is entitled to qualified immunity, and\ntherefore uphold the district court’s order dismissing all claims\nagainst him, we need not consider the parties’ arguments regarding\nsubstitution of a representative for the deceased.\n\f",

Appellants contend their designation to CMUs\nviolated their due process rights. One appellant also alleges\nhis continued CMU placement was in retaliation for protected\nspeech in violation of the First Amendment. Finally,\nappellants seek damages under the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct (PLRA) for a variety of injuries allegedly arising out of\ntheir confinement in CMUs, including the denial of certain\neducational and professional programming, violations of their\nconstitutional rights, and harm to familial relationships. The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the government\non each claim.\n\n    Because we find the duration and atypicality of CMU\ndesignation sufficient to give rise to a liberty interest, we\nreverse the district court and remand for further proceedings\nto determine whether appellants were afforded sufficient\nprocess. With respect to the retaliation claim, we affirm the\ngrant of summary judgment for the government because\n\f                               3\nappellant cannot show his First Amendment rights were\nviolated. Unlike the district court, we hold appellants have\nalleged harms qualifying for compensation under the PLRA\nbecause their injuries were neither mental nor emotional in\nnature and so do not require a showing of physical injury. We\nnonetheless uphold the grant of summary judgment because\nwe find the prison official entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                               I.\n\n             A. Communication Management Units\n\n     The CMUs at the heart of this controversy are located at\ntwo federal correctional facilities in Terre Haute, Indiana, and\nMarion, Illinois. They were established in 2006 and 2008,\nrespectively. See Aref v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2476204\"><a href=\"/opinion/2476204/aref-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153\n(D.D.C. 2011). The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) designed\nCMUs in response to a problem identified by the Department\nof Justice: a “deficiency” in the monitoring of inmate\ncommunications that allowed several inmates with terrorism-\nrelated convictions to communicate with extremist groups\noutside the prisons. CMUs thus house inmates who require\ncommunications monitoring beyond that which can feasibly\nbe provided in the general population.\n\n     CMU inmates have access to more limited and less\nprivate communications compared to general population\ninmates. All visits—aside from attorney visits—must be\n“non-contact,” meaning a glass wall separates the inmate and\nvisitor and communication takes place via a microphone. See\n28 C.F.R § 540.205(a). All visits must be conducted in\nEnglish, live-monitored, and recorded by BOP. See id.\nAlthough BOP regulations allow visitation to be restricted to\nfour one-hour visits each month, id., BOP currently permits\nup to eight hours a month. CMU inmates are also restricted in\n\f                                4\nthe frequency and length of their written correspondence,\nwhich is subject to inspection. See id. § 540.203. Finally,\nexcept for unmonitored attorney calls, CMU inmates can\ntelephone only immediate family members, and the calls are\nmonitored. Id. § 540.204. Under the regulation, telephonic\ncommunication can be limited to no more than three fifteen-\nminute calls per month, id., but BOP currently allows inmates\ntwo fifteen-minute calls per week.\n\n     Aside from these restrictions, CMUs essentially function\nas “self-contained general population housing unit[s].” J.A.\n108. Inmates typically are not confined to their cells except at\nnight and during security checks. They have access to\ncommon areas for up to sixteen hours a day, recreational\nfacilities, exercise equipment, and the library. They can keep\npersonal property in their cells, participate in religious\nservices, receive educational and professional training, and be\ndesignated for work assignments.\n\n     An inmate can be designated to a CMU for several\nreasons, including having a conviction offense related to\ninternational or domestic terrorism; demonstrating a\npropensity for using communication channels to further\nillegal activity outside the prison or to contact victims;\nabusing approved communication methods; or presenting a\npotential threat to prison facilities or the public as a result of\nunmonitored communications with persons outside the prison.\nSee 28 C.F.R § 540.201. 1 Designation to a CMU begins\nwhen BOP becomes aware of information relevant to any of\n1\n  It bears noting that both CMUs were opened before BOP\nestablished any written designation criteria. In April 2010, BOP\npublished a proposed rule for public notice-and-comment. See 80\nFed. Reg. 3168 (Jan. 22, 2015). The final rule entered into effect\non February 23, 2015, almost a decade after the first CMU opened.\nId.\n\f                                 5\nthese criteria. See id. § 540.202(a). BOP’s Assistant Director\nevaluates and approves the designation if, after a review of\nthe evidence, he concludes “designation . . . is necessary to\nensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protection of the public.” 2 Id.\n§ 540.202(b). Once in the CMU, the inmate receives a\nwritten Notice of Transfer (Notice) from the Warden\nexplaining      that   the    placement     allows    increased\ncommunications monitoring, the placement is non-punitive\nand will not affect the length of incarceration, and continued\ndesignation will be reviewed “regularly” with both notice and\nan opportunity to be heard. Id. § 540.202(c). The inmate also\nreceives “an explanation of the [Assistant Director’s] decision\nin sufficient detail,” unless the Assistant Director determines\nthat providing this information would jeopardize the safety of\nthe facility or the public. Id. § 540.202(c)(4). Finally, the\ninmate may challenge his CMU designation through BOP’s\nadministrative remedy program. Id. § 540.202(c)(6).\n\n      In 2009—three years after the first CMU opened—BOP\ninstituted periodic review of prisoners, allowing for potential\nredesignation every six months. See id. § 524.11(a)(2). The\n\n2\n   Before codification of the CMU regulations, the ultimate\ndecisionmaker was BOP’s Regional Director.              The process\notherwise has remained essentially the same. Initial consideration\nbegins when an entity (institutional or otherwise) refers a prisoner\nto BOP’s Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU). The CTU creates a\n“designation packet” that includes a summary of the supporting\ninformation, a recommendation for or against, and a proposed\nNotice of Transfer. The packet is sent to the Office of General\nCounsel to be reviewed for legal sufficiency and then to the\nCorrectional Programs Division. Previously, the Regional Director\nwould distribute the packet to several administrators, allowing each\nto comment before making his final decision. Now the Assistant\nDirector makes his assessment and decision independently.\n\f                                   6\nprocess begins with the inmate’s Unit Team making an initial\ndetermination about whether continued CMU placement is\nnecessary. The inmate must be given notice forty-eight hours\nbefore this review, which takes place in person. Id.\n§ 524.11(b)(1). The recommendation considers factors like\n“whether the original rationale for CMU designation has been\nmitigated” and “whether the inmate no longer presents a risk.”\nJ.A. 689.       The Warden then receives the transfer\nrecommendation for his review.            If he agrees, the\nrecommendation is sent to the Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU)\nfor its independent assessment—which is then forwarded to\nthe Assistant Director 3 for a final decision. The inmate is\ninformed in writing of the decision and (at least theoretically)\nprovided an explanation for the result. There is no limitation\non the duration of a prisoner’s CMU placement.\n\n                            B. The Plaintiffs\n\n     (1) Yassin Aref. Aref is an Iraqi refugee convicted of\nhelping a terrorist organization prepare to launch a missile\nattack on American soil by helping to finance the missile’s\npurchase. United States v. Aref, 285 F. App’x 784, 790 (2d\nCir. 2008). He is serving a fifteen-year sentence for money\nlaundering, providing material support for terrorism,\nconspiracy, and making a false statement to the FBI. Aref,\n774 F. Supp. 2d at 154. He was initially classified as a “low\nsecurity” inmate with no disciplinary record, but he was\ntransferred to the Terre Haute CMU in May 2007. Id. Within\na day, he received a one-page Notice stating his designation\nwas because of his terrorism-related conviction and because\nhis “offense conduct included significant communication,\nassociation, and assistance to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM),” a\ndesignated terrorist organization. Id. at 154–55. Aref\n\n3\n    Previously, the decision-maker was the Regional Director.\n\f                             7\nappealed, arguing he had never made contact with any JeM\nmembers; he had instead unknowingly been communicating\nwith an individual cooperating with the government. The\nRegional Director denied the appeal. After eighteen months,\nAref was transferred to the Marion CMU.\n\n     In September 2010, three years after Aref’s initial\ndesignation, his Unit Team and the Warden recommended\nhim for transfer. This request was denied after the CTU\nreceived confidential law enforcement information from the\nJoint Terrorism Task Force. He was notified about the denial,\nbut the notification provided no explanation. He was again\nrecommended for transfer in March 2011, and this time the\nCTU agreed. Since April 2011, he has been housed in Marion\nPrison’s general population.\n\n     (2) Kifah Jayyousi. In 2008, Jayyousi was sentenced to a\n152-month term for conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim\nin a foreign country and conspiracy to provide material\nsupport to terrorism. He and his co-conspirators were found\nto have communicated in code and posed as a charitable\norganization to further these goals. See United States v.\nJayyousi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613864\"><a href=\"/opinion/613864/united-states-v-jayyousi/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1091–92 (11th Cir. 2011).\nAlthough he was originally classified as a “low security”\nprisoner, he was transferred to the Terre Haute CMU in June\n2008. Upon arrival, he received a Notice pointing to his\nterrorism-related conviction and offense conduct—which\ninvolved communication and association with al-Qaida—as\nthe basis for his transfer. He appealed administratively,\narguing this information was inaccurate; BOP denied his\nappeal without responding to his factual challenges.\n\n    Jayyousi was first considered for redesignation in\nDecember 2009, but his Unit Team recommended against it\nbecause of the severity of his offense. In October 2010, he\n\f                              8\nwas transferred to the Marion CMU. His Unit Team and\nWarden recommended him for transfer in 2011 based on good\nconduct.     Leslie Smith—then-Chief of BOP’s CTU—\ndisagreed because of a sermon Jayyousi gave as part of a\nMuslim prayer meeting in which he participated in 2008\nwhile at Terre Haute’s CMU. Although Jayyousi received a\ndisciplinary charge for that incident, he was cleared of any\nwrongdoing years before Smith considered this request. In\nMarch 2013, Jayyousi was again recommended for transfer,\nwhich was approved by the Regional Director without\nexplanation. He continues to be housed in Marion Prison’s\ngeneral population.\n\n     (3) Daniel McGowan. McGowan was a member of the\nEarth Liberation Front, a domestic terrorist organization.\nAref, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 155. He was sentenced to a seven\nyear term in 2007 for two counts of arson. Id. McGowan was\nalso originally classified as a “low security” prisoner with no\nprison disciplinary record. Nonetheless, he was transferred to\nthe Marion CMU in August 2008. He received his Notice ten\ndays later, which cited his offense conduct as involving arson\nand the “destruction of an energy facility,” as well as\ncommunicating in code and teaching others how to commit\narson. See id. McGowan appealed, challenging the factual\nassertions in his Notice as demonstrably false—pointing out\nhe had never been accused or convicted of any crime relating\nto the destruction of an energy facility. BOP did not respond\ndirectly to McGowan’s challenge, denied his appeal, and\ndirected him to his pre-sentence report, which contained no\nmention of any energy facility.\n\n     McGowan was first recommended for transfer in 2010,\nwhich the Regional Director denied without explanation. In\nJuly 2010, he was again recommended for transfer, which the\nRegional Director granted without explanation. A few\n\f                               9\nmonths later, BOP officials determined that McGowan was\nattempting to circumvent the communication monitoring\ncontrols imposed on the general population; he was thus\nredesignated to the CMU in 2011. He remained in the CMU\nuntil his release from prison in December 2012; he was fully\nreleased from BOP supervision in June 2013.\n\n                      C. Procedural History\n\n     On April 1, 2010, seven plaintiffs filed suit against BOP,\nalleging a variety of claims related to their CMU placement:\nviolation of their procedural due process rights due to\ninadequate notice and lack of opportunity to be heard;\nviolation of their substantive due process and First\nAmendment rights to “family integrity”; violation of the\nEighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual\npunishment; retaliatory transfer into the CMU in violation of\nthe First Amendment; and unlawful discrimination on the\nbasis of religion in violation of the First and Fifth\nAmendments.

Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, transfer out of the CMUs, and an order requiring they\nbe allowed the same communication privileges as other\nprisoners. See Aref, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 157.\n\n     The district court dismissed all but the procedural due\nprocess and First Amendment retaliation claims. See id. at\n161–71. In November 2012, Aref, Jayyousi, and McGowan\nfiled an amended complaint adding a retaliation claim against\ndefendants in their official capacities and against Leslie Smith\nin his individual capacity. Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 138. At\nthe motion to dismiss stage, the district court found the PLRA\nbarred plaintiffs’ individual-capacity claims and dismissed\n\f                                10\nMcGowan’s equitable claims as moot because he had been\nreleased from BOP custody. See id. at 142–44, 147–49. 4\n\n     Defendants then filed motions for summary judgment on\nthe remaining claims: Jayyousi and Aref’s official-capacity\ndue process claim and Jayyousi’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaim. In March 2015, the district court granted summary\njudgment in favor of defendants, finding plaintiffs lacked any\nliberty interest sufficient to trigger due process protections\nand that Jayyousi’s First Amendment rights were not violated.\nSee Aref v.

Appellants\nchallenge as inadequate the procedures used to designate them\nto the CMUs, claiming their transfer and lengthy placement in\nthe units deprived them of their liberty in violation of the\nConstitution. Outside the penal context, we simply would\nevaluate the procedures under the now familiar Mathews v.\nEldridge balancing test: first identifying the liberty interest at\nstake, then considering the risk of erroneous deprivation\nunder existing procedures, and finally weighing the\n\nthe Supreme Court consistently has required a finding that the\ncessation was undertaken because of the litigation.

We are therefore unpersuaded by the government’s\nargument that appellants must prove their transfers were “because\nof” this litigation. And even if so, circumstantial evidence indicates\nthe transfers may have been motivated at least in part by the\npending litigation: not a single prisoner was transferred back into\ngeneral population during the first three years of the CMU, until a\nthen-named plaintiff was transferred out on the eve of this\nlitigation.

Liberty Interest\n\n     With these broad principles in mind, the Supreme Court\nin Sandin v. Conner articulated a new test for identifying\nliberty interests in confinement conditions. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1995). Courts previously had looked to state law to\ndetermine whether a liberty interest existed; under Sandin, the\ninquiry now focuses on the nature of the deprivation and its\nduration. Specifically, the Court held a liberty interest exists\n\f                               15\nonly if the conditions amount to an “atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.” Id. at 484. Absent a liberty interest, an inmate is\nnot entitled to any process.\n\n     In Sandin, a prisoner challenged the procedure used to\nplace him in disciplinary segregation for thirty days. The\nCourt held this placement did not amount to a liberty interest,\nnoting “disciplinary segregation, with insignificant\nexceptions, mirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates\nin administrative segregation and protective custody.” Id. at\n486. The Court observed inmates in that prison’s general\npopulation also had “significant amounts” of “lockdown\ntime.” Id. Finally, the Court found the inmate’s confinement\nwould not “inevitably affect” the length of his sentence. Id. at\n487. Thus, “a comparison between inmates inside and outside\ndisciplinary segregation” demonstrated his placement there\nfor 30 days “did not work a major disruption in his\nenvironment.” Id. at 486.\n\n                  (1) Precedent Applying Sandin\n\n     The Sandin Court did not define the baseline from which\nto measure what is “atypical and significant” in a particular\nprison system, so lower court assessments have diverged.

Because administrative\nsegregation is most routinely imposed, the court held it\nconstitutes the proper baseline. Id. In doing so, though, the\ncourt took pains to emphasize this comparison “does not end\nour analysis.” Id. We must look “not only to the nature of the\ndeprivation . . . but also to its length” in evaluating atypicality\nand significance. Id.

Id. at 858. Specifically, the district court was\nto compare the conditions faced by the inmate (who was\nsegregated due to a disciplinary infraction) to the usual\nconditions of administrative segregation. Id. And even if the\ndistrict court concluded those conditions were “no more\nrestrictive” than administrative segregation, it was still\nrequired to determine whether confinement for twenty-nine\nweeks was “atypical” compared to the length of\nadministrative segregation routinely imposed on similarly\nsituated prisoners.

Like Sandin, the vast majority of penal due process\ncases involve punitive deprivations, i.e., confinement or\nprivilege restriction for disciplinary purposes or while\npending the outcome of an investigation. See, e.g., Skinner v.\nCunningham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201932\"><a href=\"/opinion/201932/skinner-v-cunningham/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1st Cir. 2005) (“Skinner\nwas a prisoner serving a sentence for murder who had just\nkilled another inmate.

While an inmate can be designated to a CMU for\nabusing the prison’s communication system, most were\ntransferred there to ensure prison officials could effectively\nmonitor their communications—not for any punitive purpose.\nIn this way, CMU designation is more analogous to\ntransferring an individual to a harsher prison based on gang\nstatus, for instance, than it is to disciplinary segregation.\n\n     We do not think this similarity ends the inquiry,\nhowever. We recognize the Court held in several pre-Sandin\ncases that “transfer of an inmate to less amenable and more\nrestrictive quarters for nonpunitive reasons is well within the\nterms of confinement ordinarily contemplated by a prison\nsentence.” Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 468. In Meachum v. Fano, for\nexample, the Court found no liberty interest even when the\n\f                              21\ntransfer would “place the prisoner in substantially more\nburdensome conditions [than] he had been experiencing”\nbecause such transfers “are made for a variety of reasons and\noften involve no more than informed predictions as to what\nwould best serve institutional security or the safety and\nwelfare of the inmate.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109510\"><a href=\"/opinion/109510/meachum-v-fano/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 225 (1976); see also id.\nat 228 (noting it does not matter if the transfer is “for\nwhatever reason or for no reason at all”). Circuit courts have\nalso consistently held that, “generally speaking, a prisoner has\nno liberty interest in his custodial classification.” Hernandez\nv. Velasquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"59466\"><a href=\"/opinion/59466/hernandez-v-velasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (5th Cir. 2008). It follows\nthen that a classification like gang status—and any\ndeprivations that flow from it—cannot de facto constitute a\nliberty interest. See, e.g., id. at 563–64 (concluding lockdown\nto prevent gang-violence should be expected as an ordinary\nincidence of prison life); Adams v. Small, 542 F. App’x 567,\n568 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding no liberty interest in\nclassification status as a gang member); Perez v. Fed. Bureau\nof Prisons, 229 F. App’x 55, 58 (3d Cir. 2007) (“Because\nchanges in security classifications and limits on telephone\nusage are ordinary incidents of prison confinement,” no\nliberty interest existed).\n\n     This line of pre-Sandin precedent undermines appellants’\narguments.      But, most recently, the Supreme Court\nacknowledged that, while “the Constitution itself does not\ngive rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more\nadverse conditions of confinement,” a lesser liberty interest\n“in avoiding particular conditions of confinement may arise”\nif Sandin’s requirements are met. Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at\n221–22 (emphasis added). In Wilkinson, inmates who were\nassigned to Ohio’s Supermax Prison (OSP) on the basis of\neither their convictions (e.g., organized crime) or their\nengagement in specific conduct (e.g., leading a prison gang)\nchallenged their transfer as violating due process. The Court\n\f                                 22\nconcluded these inmates had a liberty interest in avoiding\ntransfer to OSP because OSP prohibited almost all human\ncontact and because placement there was indefinite, subject\nonly to annual review, and disqualified otherwise eligible\ninmates from parole consideration. See id. at 223–24.\n\n     A district court in our circuit also recently found a\nprisoner plausibly alleged harsh and atypical conditions\nbecause “he [had] been segregated from the general\npopulation for over six years” after he was formally classified\nas a “terrorist inmate.” Royer v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (D.D.C. 2013). 9 The court concluded\nthat, even if the conditions alleged were “no more restrictive”\nthan administrative segregation, the complaint should survive\nbecause the conditions were permanent and intended to last\nfor the remainder of his twenty-year sentence—another\nsixteen-and-a-half years. Id.        In doing so, the court\ndistinguished Meachum as relating to the location of an\ninmate’s confinement rather than to the atypical conditions of\nthat confinement. See id. at 191. We agree. Although\nappellants’ deprivations are more akin to transfer based on a\nnon-punitive classification than disciplinary segregation, the\nSandin framework still guides our analysis of whether these\nparticular conditions can be considered “atypical and\nsignificant.” 10\n\n\n\n\n9\n   The case was never resolved on its merits as it was ultimately\ndismissed as moot after the motion to dismiss stage.\n10\n   The Tenth Circuit has also used its version of the Sandin analysis\nto evaluate whether inmates—transferred on the basis of their\nterrorism-related offenses—had a liberty interest in avoiding\ndesignation to the Administrative Maximum Prison (ADX). See\nRezaq, 677 F.3d at 1013.\n\f                              23\n                (2) Appellants’ Due Process Claim\n\n     Having examined this legal backdrop, we turn now to\nappellants’ specific claims. Whether a liberty interest exists\nhere is admittedly a close call. All parties agree CMUs are\nless extreme in terms of deprivation than administrative\nsegregation. Inmates in administrative segregation must\nremain in their cells for twenty-three hours a day; they are\nunable to hold jobs or access most educational opportunities.\nTheir possessions are also limited, and they can exercise only\none hour a day, five days a week. By contrast, CMU inmates\nare allowed in common spaces with other CMU inmates for\nsixteen hours a day. They have access to educational and\nprofessional opportunities, can keep as many possessions as\ninmates in the general population, and have no added\nrestrictions on exercise. Communication deprivations in\nadministrative segregation are also harsher: those inmates can\nmake only one fifteen-minute phone call per month and are\nlimited to four hours of non-contact visits per month. CMU\ninmates can make two fifteen-minute calls per week and are\nallowed two four-hour non-contact visits per month. We\ntherefore conclude CMU confinement involves significantly\nless deprivation than administrative segregation.\n\n     On the other hand, CMU designation is indefinite—\nlasting years in appellants’ case—and atypical because even\nthough several thousand inmates could be designated to\nCMUs based on their commitment offenses, only a handful\nare placed under these restrictions. The main tension, then, is\nhow atypicality, indefiniteness, and the harshness of the\ndepravations should be weighed.\n\n     We find three factors significant. Although CMU\ndesignation seems analogous to a classification, it is exercised\nselectively; the duration is indefinite and could be permanent;\n\f                              24\nthe deprivations—while not extreme—necessarily increase in\nseverity over time. An inmate placed in administrative\nsegregation may be wholly unable to communicate with his\nfamily or the outside world, but that restriction will generally\nonly last for a few weeks. Inmates housed in CMUs, by\ncontrast, may spend years denied contact with their loved\nones and with diminished ability to communicate with them.\nThe harms of these deprivations are heightened over time, as\nchildren grow older and relationships with the outside become\nmore difficult to maintain. Cf. Wilkerson v. Stalder, 639 F.\nSupp. 2d 654, 684 (M.D. La. 2007) (“With each passing day\nits effects are exponentially increased, just as surely as a\nsingle drop of water repeated endlessly will eventually bore\nthrough the hardest of stones.”).\n\n      Admittedly, Sandin’s metric seems more difficult to\napply where the transfer involves non-punitive classification\nrather than disciplinary segregation; and, as Wilkinson\nacknowledges, the difficulty of establishing an appropriate\nSandin baseline has led to widely disparate conclusions about\nwhat constitutes an atypical and significant hardship. 545\nU.S. at 223. However, as Wilkinson makes clear, Sandin did\nnot eliminate liberty interests created by prison regulations;\ninstead, it focused the inquiry on the condition itself. Sandin\ndetermines whether this lesser interest receives protection, but\nis silent as to its weight in the Mathews balance. Id. What we\nthink pushes CMU designation over the Sandin threshold is\nits selectivity and duration, not its severity, and BOP’s\nrecognition that some process—however de minimis—is due.\nThus, because we find the designation meets Sandin’s\nrequirements, we must consider the sufficiency of BOP’s\nresponse.\n\n    As a final note, we address the relevance of appellants’\ncontention that CMUs are viewed as an unusual designation\n\f                                25\nreserved primarily for Muslim individuals convicted of\nterrorism-related offenses—giving rise to a stigma analogous\nto sex-offender classification. Appellants rely on Neal v.\nShimoda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749366\"><a href=\"/opinion/749366/97-cal-daily-op-serv-9274-97-daily-journal-dar-14953-aj-neal-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1997), and Chambers v.\nColorado Department of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767947\"><a href=\"/opinion/767947/john-h-chambers-v-colorado-department-of-corrections-margaret-heil-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th\nCir. 2000), to support their claim. But, in those cases, sex-\noffender classification affected the length of the inmates’\nsentences. In Neal, parole eligibility was contingent on\nsuccessful completion of a lengthy treatment program, 131\nF.3d at 825, and, in Chambers, full good time credits were not\navailable to sex offenders, 205 F.3d at 1239. In contrast,\nCMU designation is not based on any formal status as a\n“terrorist” and not every CMU inmate is associated with\nterrorist activities. Additionally, CMU designation has no\nbearing on the length of an inmate’s sentence. Thus, we do\nnot find stigma to be relevant in this context.11\n\n                           B.

We therefore remand this issue for\nresolution on a further record. We note, however, that\nappellants are challenging fundamentally predictive\njudgments in an area where administrators are given broad\ndiscretion and the government’s legitimate interests in\nmaintaining CMUs must be accorded substantial weight.\nBecause the cardinal principle in due process analysis is\nflexibility—i.e., attention to relevant context and\nconsideration of competing interests—only minimal process\nis likely due.

Jayyousi alleges that Smith\nretaliated against him by denying his transfer out of the CMU\nin 2011 because of a sermon he gave as part of a Muslim\nprayer meeting in August 2008 while housed in the Terre\nHaute CMU. The government counters Jayyousi’s language\ncould reasonably have been viewed as an attempt to radicalize\nfellow Muslims, amounting to a potential security threat. To\nprevail on his retaliation claim, Jayyousi must show: “(1) he\nengaged in conduct protected under the First Amendment; (2)\nthe defendant took some retaliatory action sufficient to deter a\nperson of ordinary firmness in plaintiff’s position from\nspeaking again; and (3) a causal link between the exercise of a\nconstitutional right and the adverse action taken against him.”\nBanks v.

To evaluate whether Jayyousi’s\nconduct was protected by the First Amendment, we look to\nthe factors laid out by the Supreme Court in Turner v.

Estate of Shabazz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (1987).\n\n     As an initial note, appellants make much of what, in their\neyes, amounted to “excessive deference” on the part of the\ndistrict court to Smith’s justifications for his actions. See\nAppellant Br. 36 (“When applying this already deferential\nTurner standard, the court is not meant to also defer to a\ndefendant’s assertion that there is, in fact, a valid, rational\nconnection between his actions and the legitimate\ngovernmental interest.”). Appellants further emphasize the\nlegal standard for summary judgment, which requires courts\nto draw all reasonable inferences in their favor. See id. at 39–\n40. The interplay between Turner and the summary judgment\nstandard is admittedly murky. But the Supreme Court in\nBeard v. Banks provided some guidance:\n\n       We must distinguish between evidence of\n       disputed facts and disputed matters of\n       professional judgment. In respect to the latter, our\n       inferences must accord deference to the views of\n       prison authorities. Unless a prisoner can point to\n       sufficient evidence regarding such issues of\n       judgment to allow him to prevail on the merits, he\n       cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145626\"><a href=\"/opinion/145626/beard-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (2006). But the Court also cautioned that\nTurner “requires prison authorities to show more than a\n\f                              29\nformalistic logical connection between a regulation and a\npenological objective.” Id. at 536. We agree with the Eighth\nCircuit that “[a] ‘reasonableness’ standard is not toothless.”\nSalaam v. Lockhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543167\"><a href=\"/opinion/543167/bilal-ali-salaam-aka-kevin-robinson-and-khalil-al-baaqee-saleem/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1171 (8th Cir. 1990).\n\n     With these principles in mind, we turn now to the first\nTurner factor. This factor, which “looms especially large,”\nasks whether the prison’s actions bear a rational connection to\nany legitimate penological interest. Amatel, 156 F.3d at 196.\nWe agree with the district court that Smith could rationally\nhave interpreted Jayyousi’s language during the prayer\nmeeting as an attempt to “radicalize” other prisoners, thereby\nconstituting a continued security risk. Although appellants\nclaim Smith exaggerated the contents of the remarks, several\nportions rationally could have been considered troubling,\nparticularly when Jayyousi stated “you are here because you\nare Muslim, not because you are a criminal” and cautioned “it\nis not U.S. versus Jayyousi; it is U.S. versus Islam.” J.A. 835.\nJayyousi also asserted the CMU was created from evil, and\nthat the suffering faced by Muslim inmates is “why we\nmartyr.” J.A. 836. Prison staff were concerned about the\nsermon at the time it was given, as evidenced by the several\nemails and follow-ups that ensued. J.A. 1292, 1296, 1298,\n1300, 1302. That Jayyousi was cleared of any wrongdoing\nthrough the prison disciplinary process does not render it\nunreasonable for Smith, as the head of BOP’s CTU, to\nconsider the content of Jayyousi’s statements in evaluating his\nCMU placement—especially the portions that indicated\nJayyousi may have been continuing some of the same actions\nthat led to his incarceration. The first factor weighs in favor\nof the government.\n\n     The second Turner factor asks whether prisoners have\nany alternative means of exercising the right at stake. The\nright at issue “must be viewed sensibly and expansively.”\n\f                              30\nThornburgh v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417 (1989). Turner and\nO’Lone are particularly instructive. In Turner, the Court “did\nnot require that prisoners be afforded other means of\ncommunicating with inmates at other institutions, nor did . . .\nO’Lone require that there be alternative means of attending\nthe [Muslim] religious ceremony.” Id. Instead, the Turner\nCourt held “it was sufficient if other means of expression . . .\nremained available” and, in O’Lone, it was sufficient “if\nprisoners were permitted to participate in other Muslim\nreligious ceremonies.” Id. at 418. Here, the second factor is\neasily satisfied; Jayyousi had other means of communicating\nhis dissatisfaction still available to him, and he was not\nprohibited from giving similar sermons in the future.\n\n     The third Turner factor looks to the impact\naccommodation of the asserted right will have on guards and\nother inmates in the prison. It is unclear, in this context, how\nBOP could have otherwise accommodated Jayyousi, as he\nwas allowed to pray and free to lead similar prayer meetings\nin the future. Appellants’ view of “accommodation” would\nrequire Smith to entirely disregard the content of Jayyousi’s\nsermon when evaluating whether he should remain in the\nCMU. But the government is not required to disregard\npotentially relevant information when making that sort of\nsecurity assessment. Appellants additionally argue that\nJayyousi’s sermon did not affect allocation of prison\nresources, but the number of emails generated and the need to\nconduct the disciplinary hearing undermine that assertion.\n\n    Finally, under the fourth factor, we must consider\nwhether Smith had any ready alternatives. Again we find the\ngovernment’s position persuasive: the CMU exists precisely\nbecause inmates who present security risks require heightened\nmonitoring. Given that charge, Smith had no real alternative\nbut to consider all information available about Jayyousi—\n\f                                31\nincluding the language used during the prayer meeting. And\nonce Smith determined continued monitoring was necessary,\nthe only option available to the government (except, perhaps\nprolonged confinement in administrative segregation) was to\nkeep Jayyousi in the CMU.\n\n     At bottom, appellants are challenging a “disputed matter\nof professional judgment” rather than disputed matters of fact.\nWe do not require government officials to be perfect in their\njudgment, merely reasonable. Because all four Turner factors\nuniformly indicate Smith’s actions here were reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate security interest, we affirm the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                               VI.\n\n     Finally, we turn to Jayyousi and McGowan’s claims\nagainst Smith in his individual capacity. Appellants seek\n“compensatory and punitive damages” for injuries they\nsuffered during their purportedly retaliatory placements in the\nCMUs. These injuries include the denial of job-related\nprogramming, the stigma of being designated to a “terrorist”\nunit, the prolonged deprivation of First Amendment rights to\npolitical speech, and the undue damage to familial\nrelationships caused by the CMUs’ unique communication\nrestrictions. But before we address the availability of\ndamages in this context, we must answer a threshold\njurisdictional question: whether these individual-capacity\nclaims survive Smith’s death in March 2015. 13\n13\n  In its briefing, the government acknowledged “[t]here is . . . no\ndefendant to respond to the individual-capacity claims, and\ngovernment counsel does not represent any party with respect to\nthose claims.” Appellee Br. 1–2. However, the government\ndecided to respond to appellants’ claims against Smith as amicus\ncuriae since “the United States has an interest in the proper\n\f                                 32\n                             A.

Courts use four factors to determine which\nstate’s policy is most advanced by application of its laws: “(1)\nthe place where the injury occurred; (2) the place where the\nconduct causing the injury occurred; (3) the domicile . . . of\n\n\nresolution of constitutional claims against its employees.” Id. at 2.\nThe government is entitled to file as amicus without the consent of\nthe parties or leave of court.

See Ind. Code § 34-9-3-1(a); 755 Ill.\nComp. Stat. 5/27-6; W. Va. Code § 55-7-8a(a). We proceed\nto the merits.\n\n                 B. Damages Under The PLRA\n\n     Jayyousi and McGowan contend they are entitled to\ncompensation under the PLRA for a variety of injuries: loss of\neducational opportunity in the form of release preparation\nprogramming, reputational harm, violation of their First\nAmendment rights, and lasting harm to their familial\nrelationships. The PLRA—in a provision entitled “Limitation\non Recovery”—states: “No Federal civil action may be\nbrought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other\ncorrectional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered\nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.”\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) (emphasis added). We are thus faced\nwith an issue of first impression for this circuit: whether\ninjuries that are allegedly neither mental nor emotional are\ncompensable under the PLRA without a prior showing of\nphysical injury. Our circuit has addressed Section 1997e(e)\nonce before in Davis v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184664\"><a href=\"/opinion/184664/davis-michael-lee-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.C. Cir. 1998). The government and district court both\ncontend Davis controls this issue. We disagree. In Davis, the\nplaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages for an\nalleged violation of his privacy after a prison official opened\nhis sealed medical records and disclosed their contents\nwithout his consent. See id. at 1345. While the Davis court\nassumed without deciding that this intrusion on his privacy\n\f                                34\namounted to a constitutional violation, it was careful to point\nout that Davis “alleged resulting emotional and mental\ndistress, but no other injury” when it held his claims for\ncompensatory and punitive damages were foreclosed by the\nPLRA. 14 Id. (emphasis added). Our circuit has therefore\nnever squarely addressed whether actual injuries that are\nneither mental nor emotional are precluded under the PLRA\nabsent a showing of physical injury. Language in Davis and\nfrom other circuits confirms this distinction. See, e.g., id. at\n1349 (“[Section] 1997e(e) precludes claims for emotional\ninjury without any prior physical injury, regardless of the\nstatutory or constitutional basis of the legal wrong” (emphasis\nadded)); Cassidy v.

A majority has held that Section 1997e(e)\nprecludes compensatory damages for any claim that does not\ninclude physical harm. 15 In doing so, these courts focus on\nthe type of injury asserted. See, e.g., Thompson v. Carter, 284\n\n14\n    But because the Davis court found other forms of relief\n(specifically injunctive and declaratory) were still available under\nSection 1997e(e), the court upheld the constitutionality of the\nstatute under rational basis review.

These\ncourts view alleged constitutional violations as a type of\nintangible harm wholly apart from mental or emotional injury.\nSee, e.g., King v. Zamiara, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (6th Cir. 2015),\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Take a prisoner who has\nalleged a credible violation of his First Amendment right to\nfree exercise but made no showing of physical harm. Rather\nthan dismiss his entire action, the majority view of Section\n1997e(e) would bar his claim for compensatory damages but\nallow his claims for injunctive relief and punitive damages to\nproceed. The minority view, on the other hand, would look to\nthe type of injury alleged—if, say, the prisoner claimed\nmental anguish in addition to the substantive constitutional\nviolation, then the first claim would be barred while the\nsecond would be eligible for compensatory damages. For the\nreasons laid out below, we are convinced this narrower\nreading of the PLRA is the proper one.\n\n     While Section 1997e(e) “may well present the highest\nconcentration of poor drafting in the smallest number of\nwords in the entire United States Code,” John Boston, The\nPrison Litigation Reform Act: The New Face of Court\nStripping, 67 BROOK. L. REV. 429, 434 (2001), we\nnonetheless begin with the statute’s plain language. See, e.g.,\nConsumer Prod. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110293\"><a href=\"/opinion/110293/consumer-product-safety-commn-v-gte-sylvania-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 (1980).             The government’s preferred\ninterpretation would render the phrase “mental and emotional\ninjury” superfluous. Had Congress intended to graft a\nphysical-injury requirement onto every single claim, the\nstatute could simply have provided: “No Federal civil action\nmay be brought by a prisoner . . . for any injury suffered while\nin custody without a prior showing of physical injury.” See\nZamiara, 788 F.3d at 213; Robinson, 170 F.3d at 749; Amaker\nv. Haponik, No. 98 CIV. 2663, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">76798</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1999) (“If Congress had intended to apply\n§ 1997e(e)’s restriction to all federal civil suits by prisoners, it\ncould easily have done so simply by dropping the qualifying\n\f                               37\nlanguage ‘for mental or emotional injury.’”). The “mental\nand emotional” language is significant precisely because\nprisoners can allege types of intangible injury that fall outside\nthat ambit.\n\n     Courts that advocate the opposite interpretation of\nSection 1997e(e) claim the provision’s “clear mandate” is a\nfocus on the type of injury pled rather than the nature of the\nunderlying right. See, e.g., Searles, 251 F.3d at 876. The\nTenth Circuit, for instance, cautioned the statute’s plain\nlanguage forecloses “divorc[ing]” the underlying substantive\nviolation from the resulting injury. Id. But our reading does\nno such thing; the focus remains on the type of injury alleged,\nwith an understanding that plaintiffs can allege intangible\nharms that are neither mental nor emotional, i.e., not every\nnon-physical injury is by default a mental or emotional injury.\n\n     In the PLRA context, many of our sister circuits have\nawarded compensatory damages for non-mental and non-\nemotional injuries.

Shake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766775\"><a href=\"/opinion/766775/john-stephen-rowe-and-dr-jeffrey-l-lant-v-michele-shake-greg-hulse/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n781 (7th Cir. 1999) (“A deprivation of First Amendment\nrights standing alone is a cognizable injury.”); Cassidy, 199\nF.3d at 375–77 (allowing claims of loss of access to prison\nprograms and services); Brooks v.

Analogous Supreme Court and circuit\nprecedent supports the view that there can be real harms\nseparate and apart from mental or emotional injury. For\ninstance, in Carey v. Piphus, the Court held that a plaintiff is\neligible to recover damages under Section 1983 if he can\ndemonstrate “some actual, if intangible, injury” caused by a\nconstitutional violation. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264 (1978). Similarly,\nthis court in Hobson v. Wilson instructed “intangible interests\n\f                              38\nmust be compensated” as long as they can be shown with\n“sufficient certainty.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437447\"><a href=\"/opinion/437447/julius-hobson-v-jerry-wilson-thomas-j-herlihy-jack-acree-christopher/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (D.C.

The Act’s\n\f                                39\npassage was precipitated by an increase in prison litigation,\nmuch of it frivolous.16 Examples cited by PLRA proponents\nranged from due process cases alleging injuries like a\ndefective haircut to, most famously, an inmate filing a cruel\nand unusual punishment claim after he was given chunky\nrather than creamy peanut butter. See 141 CONG. REC. 27,042\n(1995) (statement of Sen. Bob Dole). But members of\nCongress also made it clear that the PLRA was not meant to\nbar serious, potentially meritorious claims. See id. at 26,553\n(statement of Sen. Jon Kyl) (“Prisoners still have the right to\nseek legal redress for meritorious claims . . . .”); see also id. at\n27,044 (statement of Sen. Strom Thurmond) (“This\namendment will allow meritorious claims to be filed, but\ngives the judge broader discretion to prevent frivolous and\nmalicious lawsuits filed by prison inmates.”).\n\n     Indeed, we find it hard to believe that Congress intended\nto afford virtual immunity to prison officials even when they\ncommit blatant constitutional violations, as long as no\nphysical blow is dealt. 17 It is especially difficult to see how\n\n16\n   Notably, although there was a large increase in the absolute\nnumber of cases filed from 1975 to 1994 (6,606 cases to 39,065\ncases, respectively), Congressional debate failed to account for the\nexponential growth in the prison population in the interim. The rate\nof inmate filings actually dropped by approximately seventeen\npercent during that time period. Jennifer Winslow, Comment, The\nPrison Litigation Reform Act’s Physical Injury Requirement Bars\nMeritorious Lawsuits: Was It Meant To?, 49 UCLA L. REV. 1655,\n1662–63 (2002).\n17\n   As noted above, circuits that have adopted the broader reading of\nSection 1997e(e)’s bar support the provision’s constitutionality by\nemphasizing the availability of alternative forms of relief: namely,\ninjunctive or declaratory relief, punitive damages, and nominal\ndamages. We need not consider the constitutionality question here\nbut simply note the illusory nature, in practice, of such relief.\n\f                                40\nviolations of inmates’ First Amendment rights could ever be\nvindicated, given the unlikelihood of physical harm in that\ncontext. Against that backdrop, and a legislative record\nindicating an intention to still allow awards for meritorious\nclaims, we believe our reading of Section 1997e(e) best aligns\nwith the purposes of the PLRA.\n\n      We note also that the PLRA contains several other\nmechanisms to curb the filing of frivolous suits—making it\neven less likely Congress intended the physical-injury\nrequirement to bar claims for every serious but non-mental or\nemotional harm. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), (d) (requiring the\nexhaustion of administrative remedies and capping attorneys’\nfees for successful claims at 150 percent of damages); 28\nU.S.C. § 1915(b)(1), (g) (compelling personal payment of\ninitial filing fees and imposing a limitation on filing in forma\npauperis after having three suits previously dismissed). And,\nof course, courts have always had the power to weed out\nclaims that lack merit at earlier pleading stages, preserving\njudicial resources. Finally, we point out one additional\nlimitation relevant to appellants’ claims here. Even when a\nparty pleads an injury that is neither mental nor emotional,\nthat harm still must “be shown with sufficient certainty to\n\nInjunctive relief is commonly moot by the time a case is heard and\ncannot provide relief for past harms. Punitive damages are never\nawarded as a matter of right, and the standard is understandably\nhigh—requiring evil motive or reckless indifference to the rights of\nothers. See Smith v. Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110915\"><a href=\"/opinion/110915/smith-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51–52 (1983). Finally,\nnominal damages do little to deter repetition of the illegal conduct\nand do not provide any compensation for actual harms suffered. Cf.\nButz v. Economou, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109932\"><a href=\"/opinion/109932/butz-v-economou/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506 (1978) (“In situations of\nabuse, an action for damages against the responsible individual can\nbe an important means of vindicating constitutional guarantees.”);\nsee Doe v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413260\"><a href=\"/opinion/413260/john-doe-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124 (D.C. Cir.\n1983).\n\f                               41\navoid damages based either on pure speculation or the so-\ncalled inherent value of the rights violated.” Hobson, 737\nF.2d at 62. When “no value [can] reasonably be placed on the\nparticular injury demonstrated,” then the plaintiff is entitled\nonly to nominal damages. Id. at 63; see also Carey, 435 U.S.\nat 264 (noting plaintiffs could recover compensatory damages\n“for racial discrimination, the denial of voting rights and the\ndenial of Fourth Amendment rights” assuming they could\nprove “some actual, if intangible, injury”); Kerman, 374 F.3d\nat 130 (“The present case does not involve . . . an attempt to\nvindicate an abstract societal interest. Rather, it involves an\nanything-but-abstract physical detention. And although a\ngiven person’s loss of time may be difficult to evaluate in\nterms of dollars, his loss of liberty is not just ‘virtually\ncertain’ to occur; it is inseparable from the detention itself.”).\n\n     Having concluded a prisoner may recover compensatory\ndamages under the PLRA if he can show an actual injury—\nseparate from any mental or emotional harm—for which\ndamages can be reasonably ascertained, we note the vast\nmajority of circuits—including the majority of those that have\nadopted the broader application of Section 1997e(e)—agree\nthe provision does not limit the availability of punitive\ndamages provided a proper showing is made. See, e.g.,\nSearles, 251 F.3d at 879–80; Allah, 226 F.3d at 252–53;\nCassidy, 199 F.3d at 376–77; Carter, 284 F.3d at 418. Our\ncircuit has uniquely held that punitive damages are\nunavailable to plaintiffs who plead only mental or emotional\ninjury, without a showing of physical harm. See Davis, 158\nF.3d at 1348 (“Amicus argues that because punitive damages\nare awarded to punish the tortfeasor rather than to compensate\nthe victim, they are not embraced by § 1997e(e). But\n§ 1997e(e) draws no such distinction. It simply prevents suits\n‘for’ mental injury without prior physical injury.”). We have\nno occasion to reconsider that holding here. Instead, we\n\f                                42\nconstrue Davis narrowly and hold appellants who allege\nactual harms that are neither mental nor emotional are entitled\nto punitive damages if they can show the defendant’s conduct\nwas “motivated by evil motive or intent” or “involve[d]\nreckless or callous indifference to the federally protected\nrights of others.” Wade, 461 U.S. at 56.\n\n     Finally, every circuit, regardless of its interpretation of\nSection 1997e(e), agrees that nominal damages are available\nin this context. See Carter, 284 F.3d at 418 (listing cases).\nOur court declined to reach this issue in Davis because it\nfound the plaintiff failed to sufficiently plead nominal\ndamages. See Davis, 158 F.3d at 1349. The district court\nhere also concluded these appellants waived their claim to\nnominal damages by failing to “specifically plead” them in\ntheir complaint. Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 149. In doing so,\nthe court below relied entirely on our language in Davis.\nThere, the court felt it could not “strain[] to find inferences\nthat [were] not available on the face of the complaint or the\nbriefs submitted” because “Davis never sought nominal\ndamages” nor did his “submissions to the court ever mention\na claim to nominal relief.” Davis, 158 F.3d at 1349. But\nappellants here made a specific request for nominal damages\nin their opposition to the government’s motion to dismiss.\nBrief for Plaintiffs at 36, Aref, et al. v. Holder, et al., No. 10-\ncv-539 (D.D.C. Mar. 19, 2013), ECF No. 102. Moreover, the\nplaintiff in Davis only requested compensatory and punitive\ndamages; his pleadings did not contain any catch-all prayer\nfor relief. See Complaint, Davis v. District of Columbia, No.\n97-cv-00092 (D.D.C. Jan. 14, 1997), ECF No. 1. By contrast,\nthese appellants included a broad prayer for relief in their\ncomplaint. See Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 149 (“Plaintiffs\nrespectfully request the Court . . . [o]rder such other relief as\nthis Court deems just and proper.”). We therefore find the\nreasoning in Davis inapt.\n\f                              43\n     The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure even indicate\n“[e]very other final judgment should grant the relief to which\neach party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that\nrelief in its pleadings.” FED R. CIV. P. 54. Thus, we conclude\nappellants here have made out a sufficient claim for nominal\ndamages. And we join our sister circuits in holding that an\ninmate who cannot make out “sufficiently certain” claims for\ncompensatory damages is entitled to nominal damages,\nprovided he proves an injury occurred. See Memphis Comm.\nSch. Dis. v. Stachura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111721\"><a href=\"/opinion/111721/memphis-community-school-dist-v-stachura/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 n.11 (1986)\n(“[N]ominal damages . . . are the appropriate means of\n‘vindicating’ rights whose deprivation has not caused actual,\nprovable injury.”).\n\n     Overall, then, we conclude appellants are eligible to seek\ncompensatory, punitive, and nominal damages under Section\n1997e(e). They have asserted the following injuries: the\ndisadvantage of being denied essential reintegration\nprogramming provided by BOP; the stigma of being\ndesignated to facilities known as “terrorist units;” the\nprolonged deprivation of First Amendment rights to political\nspeech and activity; and the undue damage to primary family\nrelationships. The district court held these harms to be too\nspeculative and abstract to provide a basis for compensatory\nor punitive damages. See Aref, 953 F. Supp. 2d at 148–49.\nWe need not evaluate these injuries, however, because we\nconclude infra that Smith is entitled to qualified immunity.\nWe similarly decline to remand to the district court to\nconsider—in the first instance—whether nominal damages\nwould be appropriate.\n\n                     C. Qualified Immunity\n\n     Having concluded the PLRA does not bar appellants’\nclaims, we turn at last to the question whether Smith is\n\f                               44\nentitled to qualified immunity. Appellants can prevail only if\nthey show “(1) that the official violated a statutory or\nconstitutional right, and (2) that the right was ‘clearly\nestablished’ at the time of the challenged conduct.” Ashcroft\nv. al-Kidd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217703\"><a href=\"/opinion/217703/ashcroft-v-al-kidd/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735 (2011). For a right to have been\n“clearly established,” it must have been “clear to a reasonable\nofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted.” Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (2001). The\nSupreme Court has cautioned us not to define the right at too\nhigh a level of generality; instead, we must examine the right\nin its “particularized” context. See Reichle v. Howards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801500\"><a href=\"/opinion/801500/reichle-v-howards/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2088</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2094 (2012). Jayyousi and McGowan allege\ntheir continued confinement to the CMU (and, in McGowan’s\ncase, his redesignation) was retaliatory action taken in\nviolation of the First Amendment. At the outset, we note “the\nright in question [here] is not the general right to be free from\nretaliation for one’s speech, but the more specific right to be\nfree” from retaliation in this particular, penological context.\nId.\n\n     Especially in the context of prison security, we cannot—\nand do not—require public officials to be perfect in their\nassessments. Indeed, qualified immunity is intended to allow\n“government officials breathing room to make reasonable but\nmistaken judgments about open legal questions.” Lane v.\nFranks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2679557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2679557/lane-v-franks/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2381 (2014); see also Malley v.\nBriggs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (1986) (observing that qualified\nimmunity “provides ample protection to all but the plainly\nincompetent or those who knowingly violate the law”). We\nevaluate appellants’ arguments against this backdrop.\n\n     With respect to Jayyousi’s claim, as previously\ndiscussed, appellants have failed to make out an adequate case\nthat his First Amendment rights were violated—much less\nthat it would have been clear to any reasonable officer in\n\f                              45\nSmith’s position that denying Jayyousi’s transfer request on\nthe basis of his sermon given during the prayer meeting would\nviolate the First Amendment.           McGowan’s claims are\nsimilarly untenable. Appellants point first to McGowan’s\ninitial placement in the CMU in 2008, contending it was\nretaliation for protected political speech. But Smith had\nseveral reasons for recommending the placement; most\nnotably, that McGowan’s conviction involved domestic\nterrorist activity and that he continued to communicate with\nindividuals outside the prison involved in extreme\nenvironmental advocacy. While the First Amendment may\nprotect this sort of speech and association generally, those\nprotections are less robust in the prison context. See Pell, 417\nU.S. at 822 (“[L]awful incarceration brings about the\nnecessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and\nrights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying\nour penal system.”). Moreover, placement in the CMU did\nnot force McGowan to give up all methods of\ncommunication; it merely limited the frequency and amount.\nEven assuming McGowan could make out a First Amendment\nviolation (an unlikely prospect), he certainly cannot show\nSmith violated any clearly established right when he\nrecommended designation to the CMU.\n\n     Appellants then point to Smith’s decision to redesignate\nMcGowan to the CMU in 2011, alleging it was illegal\nretaliation for McGowan’s exercise of protected speech.\nBut—after being returned to the general population—\nMcGowan asked his wife to have his attorney send him law-\nenforcement sensitive documents, in an apparent attempt to\ncircumvent communications monitoring. It was reasonable\nfor an officer in Smith’s position to consider this attempted\nend-run around the prison’s monitoring systems when\ndeciding whether redesignation would be prudent. Yet again,\neven if McGowan could make out a First Amendment\n\f                               46\nviolation here, he cannot meet the high bar of showing an\nofficial in Smith’s position would have known his actions\nviolated a clearly established right. Smith is therefore entitled\nto qualified immunity on all of appellants’ individual-capacity\nclaims. 18\n\n                              VII.\n\n     In sum, we hold appellants’ claims were not mooted by\ntheir transfer out of the CMU and they have a liberty interest\nin avoiding transfer into the CMU. We therefore reverse the\ngrant of summary judgment on this claim and remand to the\ndistrict court to determine whether the government’s\nprocedures comport with due process as applied to\nappellants.\n\n     With respect to Jayyousi’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaim, we hold he failed to establish any constitutional\nviolation and so cannot prevail. Appellants’ individual-\ncapacity claims against Lieutenant Smith survive his death\nand, moreover, constitute claims for actual though intangible\nharms that are neither mental nor emotional. Although these\nclaims are eligible to be brought under the PLRA, they too\nfail because Smith is entitled to qualified immunity. For the\nforegoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on both these claims.\n                                                  So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n18\n   Because we hold Smith is entitled to qualified immunity, and\ntherefore uphold the district court’s order dismissing all claims\nagainst him, we need not consider the parties’ arguments regarding\nsubstitution of a representative for the deceased.\n\f</pre>",
