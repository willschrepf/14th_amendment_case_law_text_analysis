Appellee is the state\n\nof Ohio.\n\n                           FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       {¶2} The events that led to this case began in Steubenville, Jefferson County,\n\nOhio, where there is ongoing criminal gang activity. Jane Hanlin prosecuted appellant as\n\nan assistant prosecutor in the Jefferson County Prosecutor’s Office and also as the\n\nelected county prosecutor in that office. Relevant here, Hanlin prosecuted appellant in\n\ntwo separate cases which caused him to be incarcerated in the Mansfield Correctional\n\nInstitution (“ManC.I.”).\n\n                                The Steubenville shooting case\n\n       {¶3} Appellant’s criminal history includes affiliation with criminal gangs.\n\nSteubenville has ongoing gang violence between individuals from Steubenville and others\n\ncoming to the city from Chicago, to the extent the two groups are known to shoot each\n\nother on sight. Appellant and his co-defendant William Ross were on a porch when the\n\nvictim from Chicago, Torrance Lida, walked by with a group of friends. The two groups\n\n“flexed” each other, or acknowledged they saw each other. Appellant chose not to open\n\nfire on Lida immediately because there were witnesses nearby. Instead, he and Ross\n\nran through woods intending to cut off and ambush the Lida group, planning to shoot Lida\n\nin the back.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         3\n\n\n       {¶4} As they approached, however, Ross fell and fired his weapon, alerting the\n\nLida group to their presence in the woods. Lida fired back and Ross was struck in the\n\nbuttocks. Appellant fired his weapon.\n\n       {¶5} Ross cooperated with the state of Ohio and testified against appellant.\n\nAppellant was convicted of one count of felonious assault with a firearm specification and\n\none count of having weapons while under disability. He was sentenced to an aggregate\n\nprison term of 14 years: 8 years for felonious assault, consecutive to 3 years for the\n\nfirearms specification, consecutive to 3 years for having weapons while under disability.\n\nRoss was also convicted and sentenced to a prison term of 5 years. Appellant was sent\n\nto serve his term in ManC.I. and Ross was sent to Marion Correctional Institution.\n\n       {¶6} While imprisoned at Marion, Ross received a letter from appellant with a\n\ncompleted affidavit attached for him to sign. The letter threatened that if Ross did not\n\nsign the affidavit and return it to appellant by a certain deadline, appellant would reveal\n\ndiscovery paperwork from his case to appellant’s associates at Marion. The paperwork\n\nincluded statements to law enforcement and portions of trial transcript revealing Ross to\n\nbe a “snitch.” The attached affidavit recanted Ross’ testimony; it purported to absolve\n\nappellant of culpability in the Steubenville shooting, stating appellant did not want to\n\npursue the Lida group but Ross insisted; appellant only shot his weapon to scare off the\n\ngroup after they shot at Ross; and appellant was wrongly accused and “oversentenced.”\n\n       {¶7} Ross never followed through with appellant’s instructions to recant, and\n\nHanlin testified recantation would have been useless because appellant gave a\n\nvideotaped interview to law enforcement in which he bragged about instigating the\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         4\n\n\nshooting, admitting he was only prevented from shooting Lida in the back on sight by the\n\npresence of witnesses.\n\n                                The Mingo Junction home invasion\n\n       {¶8} Appellant was involved in another crime in which he and two co-defendants,\n\nStedmund Creech and Drake Burton, dressed as construction workers and paid a female\n\nto drive them to a house in Mingo Junction. The three posed as cable workers and\n\nknocked at the door of the house. When a two-year-old answered the door, they forced\n\ntheir way in and demanded cash and drugs. The three pistol-whipped a woman in the\n\nhouse when she could not keep the two-year-old quiet, and then pistol-whipped the two-\n\nyear-old, causing injuries requiring her to be life-flighted to a children’s hospital in\n\nPittsburgh. They also pistol-whipped a 13-year-old child and threatened to shoot the\n\nfather in front of his family. Before leaving, they shot the father in the leg.\n\n       {¶9} Appellant was offered a plea deal of ten years to be served concurrently\n\nwith the 14 he was already serving, an offer which was pending at the time the events in\n\nthe instant case unfolded.\n\n                                           Life at ManC.I.\n\n       {¶10} ManC.I. is a level-three institution in the Ohio prison system, intended for\n\ninmates who can’t follow the rules elsewhere or who are considered to be above-average\n\nsecurity threats.\n\n       {¶11} Appellee’s Exhibit 3 is an aerial photograph of Man.C.I. showing a ring of\n\nseparate housing areas, a completely separate segregation unit, a library, gym, and other\n\nfacilities. Inmates are housed in the separate “pods” with little to no interaction between\n\nthe pods; the groups of prisoners have separate “chow” and recreation times. Some pods\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                            5\n\n\nare lockdown pods in which the residents are not allowed out of their cells at all or are out\n\nfor very limited periods.\n\n       {¶12} Every detail of inmates’ daily lives at ManC.I. is governed by rules. Upon\n\narrival at the institution, inmates are sent to an orientation center where they receive a\n\nrule book. Infractions of prison rules result in “tickets” issued to inmates and discipline\n\nsuch as time spent in the “hole,” or segregation unit. Inmates must have passes to permit\n\ntravel to different segments of the prison, and being found somewhere without permission\n\nresults in an “out-of-place” violation. Inmates have access to telephones but all calls are\n\nmonitored, as are visitor lists. Inmates’ mail is checked and may be censored if found to\n\nbe a security threat. Purportedly inmates have no access to the internet, even at the law\n\nlibrary. Cell phones are prohibited. Unmonitored cell phone calls would give inmates\n\nunfettered access to the outside world.\n\n       {¶13} Despite these rules, violations are rife. A corrections officer testified that at\n\nleast one contraband cell phone a day is found within the facility. The main sources of\n\ncontraband are packages thrown over the fence and corrupt staff bringing items in. Cell\n\nphones sell for as much as $1000-1500 within the prison; inmates rent the phones from\n\neach other. Inmates use PayPal as one means of paying for contraband; although\n\ninmates are prohibited from having PayPal accounts, it is not uncommon to find\n\nreferences to 10-digit PayPal numbers which they use to buy contraband and influence\n\nstaff and each other. The PayPal accounts are replenished by people outside the facility.\n\nDrug use is not uncommon; the inmates in this case smoked marijuana together and\n\nappellant was once prosecuted for attempting to bring marijuana into a prison facility.\n\nInmates also have access to the internet and to social media; appellant, or someone on\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         6\n\n\nhis behalf, posted images of himself singing and dancing on Facebook and Instagram\n\nwhile incarcerated.\n\n       {¶14} Gang activity is prohibited by prison rules but gangs proliferate. A “gang” is\n\ndefined as any group the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections has not authorized\n\nto exist. Gang activity is monitored by an investigatory unit in the prison which manages\n\nthe gang population and gathers intelligence on gang members by scanning inmates’\n\nemails, phone calls, mail, and visitor lists. The gang team keeps information on each\n\ninmate called a “Security Threat Group Informational Institutional sheet,” or STGII screen,\n\nwhich tracks the inmate’s gang affiliation upon entering the institution, nicknames and/or\n\nstreet names, tattoos, and levels of participation. A gang member may be passive, active,\n\nor disruptive. Appellant’s conviction in the Steubenville shooting case included a finding\n\nof gang participation. Pursuant to his STGII screen, appellant’s affiliation upon entering\n\nManC.I. was “Blue Devil Crip” and his gang activity in the prison was described as\n\n“passive,” although appellant was apparently ticketed for a “Rule 17” violation involving a\n\ngang fight. Gang investigators were aware appellant’s visitor list included a person known\n\nto be in contact with other Crips inside the prison, including top-ranking leaders in the\n\norganization.\n\n                       Random shakedown leads to the “Chizzle Letter”\n\n       {¶15} On March 12, 2015, Corrections Officer Wheatcraft was assigned to\n\nconduct random searches of cells in the 4-A pod, to which appellant was assigned. Inside\n\nappellant’s cell, under the mattress of the top bunk, Wheatcraft discovered a “kite”\n\nenvelope. A kite is a means for inmates to contact staff members inside the institution.\n\nA kite is properly completed with an inmate’s name and number and placed inside a\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                           7\n\n\nmailbox; upon receipt by the staff member, the kite is read, signed in red, and sent back\n\nto the inmate. The kite is not designed to be sent outside the facility. The “kite” in this\n\ncase was admitted at trial as part of appellee’s Exhibit 1. The “Number” of the purported\n\nsender is “CHEZ,” the “To” line is blank, and the “Issued by” staff member signature line\n\nstates “LAC.” Appellant’s street name is “Cadillac” or “Little Lac.”\n\n       {¶16} Inside the kite, Wheatcraft found a letter which was not addressed to any\n\nstaff member.     He quickly scanned the letter for gang references but immediately\n\nrecognized the seriousness of what he found and turned the letter over to a sergeant.\n\nThe following is the letter found in appellant’s cell.\n\n                       Letter found on March 12, 2015, the “Chizzle” letter:1\n\n                      Chizzle:2\n\n                      Bro, what’s good? I kno you pissed I’m fucking up the bid\n\n              back this bitch but I should be out this bitch in two weeks, but they\n\n              might come get me before that. They offered me 14, [crossed out]\n\n              10 years, and to run it concurrent, so I’m taking it and I’m going to try\n\n              to fight off my appeals that way, and I’ll try to give them something\n\n              back.3 Feel me? But mean time, in between time, little bruh, I need\n\n\n\n\n1 The original handwritten letter was admitted as appellee’s Exhibit 1 and a typewritten\ntranscription of the letter was admitted as appellee’s Exhibit 1-A. Two witnesses read the\nletter into the record. The text of the letter here is taken from the witnesses’ testimony as\nto what the letter contained.\n2 Appellant told investigators “Chizzle” was someone he had been incarcerated with\n\nbefore, who was also at Man.C.I. when appellant first arrived but was released shortly\nafterward.\n3 The state of Ohio offered appellant a plea deal in the Mingo home invasion, including a\n\nsentence of 10 years to the run concurrently with his 14-year sentence in the shooting\ncase.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                       8\n\n\n             you. If you with the shit’s bruh, and this could get me home in two\n\n             summers, if that, little bruh. It’s some real shit too. You know Kent\n\n             State close to Akron, and the move I need you to pull is some\n\n             thorough shit. I’m going to have my dad and two of my little cousins\n\n             with you. I just need the help, bruh. And I recognize the real in you\n\n             and this move is too easy. I know you like, what the fuck is it, so let\n\n             me tell you what I got in mind.\n\n                    The prosecutor in my case, her son goes to Kent State. His\n\n             name is [John Doe]. My girl goes to school with him. She gonna get\n\n             his schedule and shit. But the plan is to snatch him up and hold him\n\n             for ransom for one month.\n\n                    Two quick demands. One is to bring Drake Burton back to\n\n             court and knock 20 years off his sentence.4 Two is to bring Anthony\n\n             Elmore, “me,” back to court and throw out the Mingo case and my\n\n             other case, drop the felonious assault, and just charge me with\n\n             weapons under (sic). Give me 18 months or a year for it. She has\n\n             exactly one month to do it or else her son disappears and ask her\n\n             what does she choose fake justice or her son’s life.\n\n                    After that, no more communicating with her until she makes\n\n             her next move. Tell her you’ll be watching to see if she cooperates.\n\n\n\n\n4Drake Burton is one of appellant’s co-defendants in the Mingo Junction home invasion\ncase.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         9\n\n\n             Once she does, her son will be back unharmed. Tell her to keep\n\n             things quiet and we’ll be in contact.\n\n                    Call from her son’s phone, then throw it away in a river or\n\n             something. Make sure the battery disconnected afterwards or break\n\n             it, then get rid of it.5 The next time you talk to her, call block, make\n\n             sure you get the number out the phone from her son’s.\n\n                    Now here’s the thing, my nigga. I know I’m making all this\n\n             seem too easy, but I know my pop’s with the shit. If you can’t get no\n\n             toys, my cousin will come through with them.6 I just need you on this,\n\n             bruh. If you do come through, I’m in debt with you for a lifetime,\n\n             whatever, whenever, bruh. Real shit. My people’s got it out in Cali.\n\n             I just gotta be on hand to get it. Once I do, I’ll break bread with you\n\n             50/50. That’s on my daughter, bruh.\n\n                    I understand if you don’t want to neither. Just get rid of this\n\n             letter for me and so be it. So be it. Feel me. But if you with this shit,\n\n             everything will be provided to you. All you gotta do is welcome my\n\n             pops and two little cousins to the A with open arms and find a friend\n\n             with Ls who can rent a small U-Haul. At the end of this letter, I’m\n\n             going to give you my dad’s info and both my little cousins. All you\n\n             gotta do is hit them up. Ask them as they trying to help their cousin\n\n             out and they gonna be game.\n\n\n\n5 Destroying the battery of the cell phone would prevent law enforcement from using the\n“Find my iPhone” feature and would disable any G.P.S. or I.P. address for the phone.\n6 “Toys” are firearms.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                       10\n\n\n                   Please stress to my dad that we gotta feed this kid for a\n\n            month, but we will not harm him at all. If shit don’t play out in six to\n\n            eight weeks, cut him loose somewhere in the A, Columbus or\n\n            Pittsburgh. All we need is duct tape, toys, a U-Haul, and a spot for\n\n            little buddy to chill, at a garage, basement, somewhere where\n\n            nobody goes or nothing. My pops will figure out that, though.\n\n                   I need you all to be super careful, watch for cameras. Don’t\n\n            have no fingerprints. Wipe everything down. Don’t speak around\n\n            the little dude. Nothing. Keep him blind and deaf at all times. Don’t\n\n            speak in that U-Haul because the walls are aluminum and you can\n\n            hear people in the front talking through that bitch. Other than that,\n\n            everything should be a walk in the park. Post up outside his crib just\n\n            chilling. When you see the duck, force him into the U-Haul. Tape\n\n            him up. Call his mom in a funny voice and let the game begin.\n\n                   Shit should go smooth. Once you get him tied up, don’t let\n\n            him move for shit, the bathroom or nothing. Just keep feeding him\n\n            food or water. Fuck it, let him stink. He’ll be all right.

On the way to the day room, they passed an ironing board.

Hanlin monitored the couple’s phone calls when she prosecuted\n\nappellant and noted despite the $9-10 charge per call, appellant and Freeman spoke\n\n“constantly.” Freeman is a student at Kent State University and is employed in the\n\nmanagement office of a student housing complex where she has access to residents’\n\nschedules, vehicle descriptions, and keys.     Hanlin identified a BMV photograph of\n\nFreeman and identified Freeman as one of the women pictured in appellee’s Exhibit 17,\n\na photo downloaded from the cell phone found under the ironing board.\n\n\n\n\n10“GTL” is the monitored prison phone system.\n11“JPay” is a device similar to an iPad, but without internet access, which inmates can\nrent from the institution upon which they can download games and music. JPay can be\nused to send email and videos but the content is monitored and screened before it is sent\nout of the institution.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                        15\n\n\n       {¶21} Hanlin’s adult son “John Doe” is also a student at Kent State and lives in\n\nthe housing complex managed by Freeman. As an athlete, Doe has a regimented\n\nschedule and his whereabouts are easily observed by office staff. Doe’s records on file\n\nat the housing complex include his family’s home address, phone numbers, and\n\nemergency contact information.\n\n       {¶22} Appellee’s evidence included Exhibit 27, a well-worn handwritten page of\n\nphone numbers and email addresses used by appellant. Numbers in Exhibit 27 matched\n\nnumbers provided in the letters, including for “Dom,” “Pops,” “Chizzle,” “Tae,” “Janard,”\n\nand “Rocket,” among others.\n\n       {¶23} Trooper Butler of the Ohio State Highway Patrol interviewed appellant twice\n\nand both interviews were recorded. In an interview on April 21, 2015, Butler asked\n\nappellant about the “Chizzle” letter. Appellant said it was something he wrote to “vent”\n\nshortly after he found himself in prison again, while he was still angry about the\n\ncircumstances although he wasn’t any longer. Appellant thought he threw the letter away\n\nbut the corrections officer found it inside a kite in his legal paperwork. Appellant denied\n\nknowing who the letter was about because he “wrote so many letters” and didn’t know\n\nwhich one specifically Butler referred to. Appellant admitted he wrote the letter, but\n\ndenied it was addressed or sent to “Chizzle.” When asked who he wanted to kidnap,\n\nappellant said it could have been anyone because he was at first angry and venting about\n\nkidnapping anyone associated with his cases. Appellant said he always had the ability to\n\n“abort” a scheme and Butler responded that he had already conspired to commit the\n\nscheme. Appellant’s response was that he could ask anyone to do anything but no one\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                            16\n\n\nwould follow through because he had no money or other means of making anyone follow\n\nthrough.\n\n       {¶24} Appellant denied having access to a cell phone and said he was careful\n\nabout what he wrote in his outgoing mail or JPays because in 2010 he “caught a case”\n\nfor writing to a relative and asking her to bring contraband into a prison. Butler then told\n\nhim they found a second letter, similar to the first, connected with a cell phone and\n\ninvestigators had a search warrant to download the contents of the phone. Appellant said\n\nhe would be glad for them to do so because there would be no evidence tying him in any\n\nway to the cell phone.\n\n       {¶25} Butler interviewed appellant again on August 11, 2015, and this time\n\nappellant was not as cordial because law enforcement had been “harassing” his friends\n\nand family. Butler asked appellant more about the circumstances of the discovery of the\n\n“C-Hood” letter and appellant denied passing the letter to Spy or Hayes. Butler responded\n\nthat one of the inmates told him appellant gave them the letter to mail out of the facility,\n\nand appellant said Butler was lying because he had no connection with the other inmates.\n\nAppellant denied passing the “C-Hood” letter to anyone else and said he had no idea how\n\nit came to be in the possession of other inmates.\n\n       {¶26} Appellee called Christian Brown, a Man.C.I. inmate, to testify against\n\nappellant at trial. Brown is associated with the “Bloods” and although it is against gang\n\nrules to snitch, he felt it was also against gang rules to go after a prosecutor’s family\n\nmembers, thus when he became aware of appellant’s plot to kidnap a prosecutor’s son,\n\nhe contacted investigators. Brown also admitted he hoped cooperation would lead to\n\nintervention by appellee to help him gain judicial release or transfer to a different facility.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                          17\n\n\n       {¶27} Brown had been incarcerated in a limited-movement pod with appellant and\n\nwhile talking to another gang member, Brown heard about the plot to kidnap Hanlin’s son.\n\nBrown said he was “kicking it” with appellant in the facility and they smoked marijuana\n\ntogether.   Appellant said he needed another inmate to set up a three-way phone\n\nconversation for him so he could talk to someone on the street in Steubenville. Brown\n\nfacilitated the conversation. Appellant told Brown the names of two people who would\n\nhelp him, including “Jay Rock” and “Cut Cut.” “Cut Cut” was supposed to handle the plot\n\noutside the prison and hold the victim until appellant’s charges were dropped. Appellant\n\ntold Brown two of his letters had been intercepted.\n\n       {¶28} Appellant testified on his own behalf at trial and denied having any\n\nconversations with Christian Brown, much less smoking marijuana with him. Appellant\n\nsaid he wrote many letters similar to those found in this case, and that he offered the\n\nother letters to corrections officers but they weren’t interested. He said the letters were\n\nwritten shortly after he arrived at Man.C.I. in June 2014, and he didn’t realize the letters\n\nstill existed because he thought he had thrown them away. Appellant said the “Chizzle”\n\nletter never left his cell, and he had no idea how the “C-Hood” letter came to be in the cell\n\nof Spy and Hayes. Appellant testified Spy was his neighbor in the facility before he was\n\nmoved, but denied giving the letter to Spy to mail. Appellant insisted the letters were\n\nwritten to “vent” his anger and that he never actually communicated about the details of\n\nthe kidnapping plot to anyone, including Freeman, his father, or any other family\n\nmembers. He disagreed with Hanlin’s identifications of people in the pictures found in the\n\ncell phone, including of Dominique Freeman. He also testified he was no longer involved\n\nin any gang and that he didn’t take part in any gang activities at Man.C.I., although he\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                        18\n\n\nadmitted he was ticketed for a gang fight after he was purportedly “jumped out” of the\n\ngang.12\n\n        {¶29} Appellant was charged by indictment as follows: Count I, conspiracy to\n\ncommit kidnapping pursuant to R.C. 2923.01(A)(1)/2905.01(A)(1) and/or (A)(5), a felony\n\nof the second degree; Count II, attempted kidnapping pursuant to R.C. 2923.02(A) and\n\n2905.01(A)(10 and/or (A)(5), a felony of the second degree; Count III, attempted extortion\n\npursuant to R.C. 2905.11(A)(1) and/ or (A)(2) and/or (A)(4), a felony of the fourth degree;\n\nand Count IV, falsification pursuant to R.C. 2921.13(A)(3), a misdemeanor of the first\n\ndegree.\n\n        {¶30} Appellant entered pleas of not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial by\n\njury. The trial court dismissed Count I, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, “for failure to\n\nallege an overt act in the indictment.” Appellant was found guilty upon the remaining\n\ncounts. The trial court proceeded to immediately sentence appellant to consecutive\n\nprison terms of 8 years upon Count II and 18 months upon Count III, concurrent with a\n\njail term of 6 months upon Count IV.\n\n        {¶31} Appellant now appeals from the trial court’s Sentencing Entry of July 20,\n\n2016.\n\n        {¶32} Appellant raises two assignments of error:\n\n\n\n\n12Appellant contended he was beaten out, or “jumped out,” of the Crips on December 24,\n2015.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                          19\n\n\n                               ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n       {¶33} “I.

Appellant argues his convictions for attempted kidnapping and attempted\n\nextortion are against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence. We disagree.\n\n       {¶36} The legal concepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the evidence\n\nare both quantitatively and qualitatively different. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380,\n\n1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541, paragraph two of the syllabus. The standard of review\n\nfor a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is set forth in State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991) at paragraph two of the syllabus, in which the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court held, “An appellate court’s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to\n\ndetermine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the\n\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after\n\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         20\n\n\n       {¶37} In determining whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence, the court of appeals functions as the “thirteenth juror,” and after “reviewing the\n\nentire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility\n\nof witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly\n\nlost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must\n\nbe overturned and a new trial ordered.” State v. Thompkins, supra, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387.\n\nReversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence and ordering\n\na new trial should be reserved for only the “exceptional case in which the evidence weighs\n\nheavily against the conviction.” Id.\n\n       {¶38} R.C. 2923.02(A), attempt, states, “No person, purposely or knowingly, and\n\nwhen purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall\n\nengage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.” Appellant\n\nwas found guilty upon one count of attempted kidnapping pursuant to 2905.01(A)(1)\n\nand/or (A)(5). Those sections state:\n\n                     (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, or, in the case\n\n              of a victim under the age of thirteen or mentally incompetent, by any\n\n              means, shall remove another from the place where the other person\n\n              is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the\n\n              following purposes:\n\n                     (1) To hold for ransom, or as a shield or hostage;\n\n                     * * * *.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                     21\n\n\n                    (5) To hinder, impede, or obstruct a function of government,\n\n             or to force any action or concession on the part of governmental\n\n             authority;\n\n                    * * * *.\n\n      {¶39} Appellant was also found guilty upon one count of attempted extortion\n\npursuant to R.C. 2905.11(A)(1) and/or (A)(2) and/or (A)(4). Those sections state:\n\n                    (A) No person, with purpose to obtain any valuable thing or\n\n             valuable benefit or to induce another to do an unlawful act, shall do\n\n             any of the following:\n\n                    (1) Threaten to commit any felony;\n\n                    (2) Threaten to commit any offense of violence;\n\n                    * * * *.\n\n                    (4) Utter or threaten any calumny against any person;\n\n                    * * * *.\n\nAppellant argues his convictions are against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the\n\nevidence because there is no evidence he took any substantial step to cause the cell\n\nphone and the “C-Hood” letter to be found in another inmate’s cell, and there is no\n\nevidence he communicated the plan to kidnap the victim to anyone else. We disagree\n\nwith appellant’s characterization of the evidence and his resulting arguments.\n\n      {¶40} We find the existence of the plan detailed in the letters and the\n\ncircumstantial evidence of the movement of the second letter to constitute “substantial\n\nsteps” which strongly corroborates appellant’s purpose in carrying out the kidnapping\n\nscheme. The Ohio Supreme Court has elaborated on the statutory definition of “attempt”\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                           22\n\n\nin R.C. 2923.02(A) as follows: “A ‘criminal attempt’ is when one purposely does or omits\n\nto do anything which is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of\n\nconduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.” State v. Woods, 48 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 127, 357 N.E.2d 1059 (1976), paragraph one of the syllabus. A “substantial step”\n\nrequires conduct that is “strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.” Id. “[T]his\n\nstandard does properly direct attention to overt acts of the defendant which convincingly\n\ndemonstrate a firm purpose to commit a crime, while allowing police intervention * * * in\n\norder to prevent the crime when the criminal intent becomes apparent.” Id. at 132.\n\n       {¶41} We find the facts of the instant case to be similar to those of State v. Group,\n\n98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, ¶ 97, in that appellant did more\n\nthan “merely solicit” the crime in question; instead, “[h]e took all action within his power,\n\nconsidering his incarceration, to ensure that the crime would be committed.” Although\n\nappellant denied ever discussing the kidnapping plot with Freeman, in the C-Hood letter\n\nhe implicitly acknowledges that he is aware Hanlin’s son is in the residence hall managed\n\nby Freeman, and she has access to the victim’s schedule. It is readily apparent there\n\nwas discussion about Freeman’s access to information on the victim’s whereabouts.\n\n       {¶42} Appellant's acts— soliciting his criminal associates to kidnap and hold John\n\nDoe, providing those associates with information about Doe’s whereabouts at school,\n\npassing the C-Hood letter on to other inmates for transmission from the prison, and\n\nproviding associates with the necessary contact information for the named co-\n\nconspirators who will undertake the plot, and transferring the letter to other inmates for\n\ntransmission from the facility—strongly corroborate his criminal purpose, and therefore\n\nconstitute a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the kidnapping\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                             23\n\nof John Doe and the extorting of Hanlin. See, Group, supra, 2002-Ohio-7247 at ¶ 103.\n\nHere, the steps taken by appellant convincingly demonstrate a firm purpose to commit\n\nthe crimes of kidnapping and extortion. State v. Smith, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2011-CR-\n\n3470, 2012-Ohio-2956, ¶ 38. We conclude that there was sufficient competent and\n\ncredible evidence presented to the jury to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat appellee had proven each element of each of the offenses.\n\n       {¶43} Whether the woman in the photo on the cell phone is Freeman, and whether\n\nappellant transmitted the “C-Hood” letter and the cell phone to Spy’s cell, were for the jury\n\nto decide. Smith, supra, 2012-Ohio-2956 at ¶ 40. Ultimately, “the reviewing court must\n\ndetermine whether the appellant or the appellee provided the more believable evidence,\n\nbut must not completely substitute its judgment for that of the original trier of fact ‘unless\n\nit is patently apparent that the fact finder lost its way.’” Id., quoting State v. Woullard, 158\n\nOhio App.3d 31, 2004–Ohio–3395, 813 N.E.2d 964, ¶ 81. In other words, “[w]hen there\n\nexist two fairly reasonable views of the evidence or two conflicting versions of events,\n\nneither of which is unbelievable, it is not our province to choose which one we believe.”\n\nId., citing State v. Gore, 131 Ohio App.3d 197, 201, 722 N.E.2d 125 (7th Dist.1999). The\n\nweight to be given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are issues for the\n\ntrier of fact. State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212(1967), paragraph one\n\nof the syllabus.\n\n       {¶44} The jury was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by\n\nthe parties and assess the witness's credibility. “While the jury may take note of the\n\ninconsistencies and resolve or discount them accordingly * * * such inconsistencies do\n\nnot render defendant's conviction against the manifest weight or sufficiency of the\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                              24\n\nevidence.” Smith, supra, 2012-Ohio-2956, at ¶ 41, citing State v. Nivens, 10th Dist. No.\n\n95APA09–1236, 1996 WL 284714 (May 28, 1996). Indeed, the jury need not believe all\n\nof a witness' testimony, but may accept only portions of it as true. Id., citing State v. Antill,\n\n176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964).\n\n       {¶45} We find appellant’s convictions are supported by sufficient evidence and\n\nthat this is not an “‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the\n\nconviction.’” Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, quoting Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175,\n\n485 N.E.2d 717. The jury was in the best position to evaluate this competent, credible\n\nevidence, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact. The jury\n\nneither lost their way nor created a miscarriage of justice in finding appellant guilty.\n\nAppellant’s two assignments of error are overruled.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       {¶46} Appellant’s two assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the\n\nRichland County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nBy: Delaney, P.J.,\n\nWise, John, J. and\n\nWise, Earle, J., concur.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52   25\n\f",

Appellee is the state\n\nof Ohio.\n\n                           FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       {¶2} The events that led to this case began in Steubenville, Jefferson County,\n\nOhio, where there is ongoing criminal gang activity. Jane Hanlin prosecuted appellant as\n\nan assistant prosecutor in the Jefferson County Prosecutor’s Office and also as the\n\nelected county prosecutor in that office. Relevant here, Hanlin prosecuted appellant in\n\ntwo separate cases which caused him to be incarcerated in the Mansfield Correctional\n\nInstitution (“ManC.I.”).\n\n                                The Steubenville shooting case\n\n       {¶3} Appellant’s criminal history includes affiliation with criminal gangs.\n\nSteubenville has ongoing gang violence between individuals from Steubenville and others\n\ncoming to the city from Chicago, to the extent the two groups are known to shoot each\n\nother on sight. Appellant and his co-defendant William Ross were on a porch when the\n\nvictim from Chicago, Torrance Lida, walked by with a group of friends. The two groups\n\n“flexed” each other, or acknowledged they saw each other. Appellant chose not to open\n\nfire on Lida immediately because there were witnesses nearby. Instead, he and Ross\n\nran through woods intending to cut off and ambush the Lida group, planning to shoot Lida\n\nin the back.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         3\n\n\n       {¶4} As they approached, however, Ross fell and fired his weapon, alerting the\n\nLida group to their presence in the woods. Lida fired back and Ross was struck in the\n\nbuttocks. Appellant fired his weapon.\n\n       {¶5} Ross cooperated with the state of Ohio and testified against appellant.\n\nAppellant was convicted of one count of felonious assault with a firearm specification and\n\none count of having weapons while under disability. He was sentenced to an aggregate\n\nprison term of 14 years: 8 years for felonious assault, consecutive to 3 years for the\n\nfirearms specification, consecutive to 3 years for having weapons while under disability.\n\nRoss was also convicted and sentenced to a prison term of 5 years. Appellant was sent\n\nto serve his term in ManC.I. and Ross was sent to Marion Correctional Institution.\n\n       {¶6} While imprisoned at Marion, Ross received a letter from appellant with a\n\ncompleted affidavit attached for him to sign. The letter threatened that if Ross did not\n\nsign the affidavit and return it to appellant by a certain deadline, appellant would reveal\n\ndiscovery paperwork from his case to appellant’s associates at Marion. The paperwork\n\nincluded statements to law enforcement and portions of trial transcript revealing Ross to\n\nbe a “snitch.” The attached affidavit recanted Ross’ testimony; it purported to absolve\n\nappellant of culpability in the Steubenville shooting, stating appellant did not want to\n\npursue the Lida group but Ross insisted; appellant only shot his weapon to scare off the\n\ngroup after they shot at Ross; and appellant was wrongly accused and “oversentenced.”\n\n       {¶7} Ross never followed through with appellant’s instructions to recant, and\n\nHanlin testified recantation would have been useless because appellant gave a\n\nvideotaped interview to law enforcement in which he bragged about instigating the\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         4\n\n\nshooting, admitting he was only prevented from shooting Lida in the back on sight by the\n\npresence of witnesses.\n\n                                The Mingo Junction home invasion\n\n       {¶8} Appellant was involved in another crime in which he and two co-defendants,\n\nStedmund Creech and Drake Burton, dressed as construction workers and paid a female\n\nto drive them to a house in Mingo Junction. The three posed as cable workers and\n\nknocked at the door of the house. When a two-year-old answered the door, they forced\n\ntheir way in and demanded cash and drugs. The three pistol-whipped a woman in the\n\nhouse when she could not keep the two-year-old quiet, and then pistol-whipped the two-\n\nyear-old, causing injuries requiring her to be life-flighted to a children’s hospital in\n\nPittsburgh. They also pistol-whipped a 13-year-old child and threatened to shoot the\n\nfather in front of his family. Before leaving, they shot the father in the leg.\n\n       {¶9} Appellant was offered a plea deal of ten years to be served concurrently\n\nwith the 14 he was already serving, an offer which was pending at the time the events in\n\nthe instant case unfolded.\n\n                                           Life at ManC.I.\n\n       {¶10} ManC.I. is a level-three institution in the Ohio prison system, intended for\n\ninmates who can’t follow the rules elsewhere or who are considered to be above-average\n\nsecurity threats.\n\n       {¶11} Appellee’s Exhibit 3 is an aerial photograph of Man.C.I. showing a ring of\n\nseparate housing areas, a completely separate segregation unit, a library, gym, and other\n\nfacilities. Inmates are housed in the separate “pods” with little to no interaction between\n\nthe pods; the groups of prisoners have separate “chow” and recreation times. Some pods\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                            5\n\n\nare lockdown pods in which the residents are not allowed out of their cells at all or are out\n\nfor very limited periods.\n\n       {¶12} Every detail of inmates’ daily lives at ManC.I. is governed by rules. Upon\n\narrival at the institution, inmates are sent to an orientation center where they receive a\n\nrule book. Infractions of prison rules result in “tickets” issued to inmates and discipline\n\nsuch as time spent in the “hole,” or segregation unit. Inmates must have passes to permit\n\ntravel to different segments of the prison, and being found somewhere without permission\n\nresults in an “out-of-place” violation. Inmates have access to telephones but all calls are\n\nmonitored, as are visitor lists. Inmates’ mail is checked and may be censored if found to\n\nbe a security threat. Purportedly inmates have no access to the internet, even at the law\n\nlibrary. Cell phones are prohibited. Unmonitored cell phone calls would give inmates\n\nunfettered access to the outside world.\n\n       {¶13} Despite these rules, violations are rife. A corrections officer testified that at\n\nleast one contraband cell phone a day is found within the facility. The main sources of\n\ncontraband are packages thrown over the fence and corrupt staff bringing items in. Cell\n\nphones sell for as much as $1000-1500 within the prison; inmates rent the phones from\n\neach other. Inmates use PayPal as one means of paying for contraband; although\n\ninmates are prohibited from having PayPal accounts, it is not uncommon to find\n\nreferences to 10-digit PayPal numbers which they use to buy contraband and influence\n\nstaff and each other. The PayPal accounts are replenished by people outside the facility.\n\nDrug use is not uncommon; the inmates in this case smoked marijuana together and\n\nappellant was once prosecuted for attempting to bring marijuana into a prison facility.\n\nInmates also have access to the internet and to social media; appellant, or someone on\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         6\n\n\nhis behalf, posted images of himself singing and dancing on Facebook and Instagram\n\nwhile incarcerated.\n\n       {¶14} Gang activity is prohibited by prison rules but gangs proliferate. A “gang” is\n\ndefined as any group the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections has not authorized\n\nto exist. Gang activity is monitored by an investigatory unit in the prison which manages\n\nthe gang population and gathers intelligence on gang members by scanning inmates’\n\nemails, phone calls, mail, and visitor lists. The gang team keeps information on each\n\ninmate called a “Security Threat Group Informational Institutional sheet,” or STGII screen,\n\nwhich tracks the inmate’s gang affiliation upon entering the institution, nicknames and/or\n\nstreet names, tattoos, and levels of participation. A gang member may be passive, active,\n\nor disruptive. Appellant’s conviction in the Steubenville shooting case included a finding\n\nof gang participation. Pursuant to his STGII screen, appellant’s affiliation upon entering\n\nManC.I. was “Blue Devil Crip” and his gang activity in the prison was described as\n\n“passive,” although appellant was apparently ticketed for a “Rule 17” violation involving a\n\ngang fight. Gang investigators were aware appellant’s visitor list included a person known\n\nto be in contact with other Crips inside the prison, including top-ranking leaders in the\n\norganization.\n\n                       Random shakedown leads to the “Chizzle Letter”\n\n       {¶15} On March 12, 2015, Corrections Officer Wheatcraft was assigned to\n\nconduct random searches of cells in the 4-A pod, to which appellant was assigned. Inside\n\nappellant’s cell, under the mattress of the top bunk, Wheatcraft discovered a “kite”\n\nenvelope. A kite is a means for inmates to contact staff members inside the institution.\n\nA kite is properly completed with an inmate’s name and number and placed inside a\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                           7\n\n\nmailbox; upon receipt by the staff member, the kite is read, signed in red, and sent back\n\nto the inmate. The kite is not designed to be sent outside the facility. The “kite” in this\n\ncase was admitted at trial as part of appellee’s Exhibit 1. The “Number” of the purported\n\nsender is “CHEZ,” the “To” line is blank, and the “Issued by” staff member signature line\n\nstates “LAC.” Appellant’s street name is “Cadillac” or “Little Lac.”\n\n       {¶16} Inside the kite, Wheatcraft found a letter which was not addressed to any\n\nstaff member.     He quickly scanned the letter for gang references but immediately\n\nrecognized the seriousness of what he found and turned the letter over to a sergeant.\n\nThe following is the letter found in appellant’s cell.\n\n                       Letter found on March 12, 2015, the “Chizzle” letter:1\n\n                      Chizzle:2\n\n                      Bro, what’s good? I kno you pissed I’m fucking up the bid\n\n              back this bitch but I should be out this bitch in two weeks, but they\n\n              might come get me before that. They offered me 14, [crossed out]\n\n              10 years, and to run it concurrent, so I’m taking it and I’m going to try\n\n              to fight off my appeals that way, and I’ll try to give them something\n\n              back.3 Feel me? But mean time, in between time, little bruh, I need\n\n\n\n\n1 The original handwritten letter was admitted as appellee’s Exhibit 1 and a typewritten\ntranscription of the letter was admitted as appellee’s Exhibit 1-A. Two witnesses read the\nletter into the record. The text of the letter here is taken from the witnesses’ testimony as\nto what the letter contained.\n2 Appellant told investigators “Chizzle” was someone he had been incarcerated with\n\nbefore, who was also at Man.C.I. when appellant first arrived but was released shortly\nafterward.\n3 The state of Ohio offered appellant a plea deal in the Mingo home invasion, including a\n\nsentence of 10 years to the run concurrently with his 14-year sentence in the shooting\ncase.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                       8\n\n\n             you. If you with the shit’s bruh, and this could get me home in two\n\n             summers, if that, little bruh. It’s some real shit too. You know Kent\n\n             State close to Akron, and the move I need you to pull is some\n\n             thorough shit. I’m going to have my dad and two of my little cousins\n\n             with you. I just need the help, bruh. And I recognize the real in you\n\n             and this move is too easy. I know you like, what the fuck is it, so let\n\n             me tell you what I got in mind.\n\n                    The prosecutor in my case, her son goes to Kent State. His\n\n             name is [John Doe]. My girl goes to school with him. She gonna get\n\n             his schedule and shit. But the plan is to snatch him up and hold him\n\n             for ransom for one month.\n\n                    Two quick demands. One is to bring Drake Burton back to\n\n             court and knock 20 years off his sentence.4 Two is to bring Anthony\n\n             Elmore, “me,” back to court and throw out the Mingo case and my\n\n             other case, drop the felonious assault, and just charge me with\n\n             weapons under (sic). Give me 18 months or a year for it. She has\n\n             exactly one month to do it or else her son disappears and ask her\n\n             what does she choose fake justice or her son’s life.\n\n                    After that, no more communicating with her until she makes\n\n             her next move. Tell her you’ll be watching to see if she cooperates.\n\n\n\n\n4Drake Burton is one of appellant’s co-defendants in the Mingo Junction home invasion\ncase.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         9\n\n\n             Once she does, her son will be back unharmed. Tell her to keep\n\n             things quiet and we’ll be in contact.\n\n                    Call from her son’s phone, then throw it away in a river or\n\n             something. Make sure the battery disconnected afterwards or break\n\n             it, then get rid of it.5 The next time you talk to her, call block, make\n\n             sure you get the number out the phone from her son’s.\n\n                    Now here’s the thing, my nigga. I know I’m making all this\n\n             seem too easy, but I know my pop’s with the shit. If you can’t get no\n\n             toys, my cousin will come through with them.6 I just need you on this,\n\n             bruh. If you do come through, I’m in debt with you for a lifetime,\n\n             whatever, whenever, bruh. Real shit. My people’s got it out in Cali.\n\n             I just gotta be on hand to get it.

Hanlin monitored the couple’s phone calls when she prosecuted\n\nappellant and noted despite the $9-10 charge per call, appellant and Freeman spoke\n\n“constantly.” Freeman is a student at Kent State University and is employed in the\n\nmanagement office of a student housing complex where she has access to residents’\n\nschedules, vehicle descriptions, and keys.     Hanlin identified a BMV photograph of\n\nFreeman and identified Freeman as one of the women pictured in appellee’s Exhibit 17,\n\na photo downloaded from the cell phone found under the ironing board.\n\n\n\n\n10“GTL” is the monitored prison phone system.\n11“JPay” is a device similar to an iPad, but without internet access, which inmates can\nrent from the institution upon which they can download games and music.

As an athlete, Doe has a regimented\n\nschedule and his whereabouts are easily observed by office staff. Doe’s records on file\n\nat the housing complex include his family’s home address, phone numbers, and\n\nemergency contact information.\n\n       {¶22} Appellee’s evidence included Exhibit 27, a well-worn handwritten page of\n\nphone numbers and email addresses used by appellant. Numbers in Exhibit 27 matched\n\nnumbers provided in the letters, including for “Dom,” “Pops,” “Chizzle,” “Tae,” “Janard,”\n\nand “Rocket,” among others.\n\n       {¶23} Trooper Butler of the Ohio State Highway Patrol interviewed appellant twice\n\nand both interviews were recorded. In an interview on April 21, 2015, Butler asked\n\nappellant about the “Chizzle” letter. Appellant said it was something he wrote to “vent”\n\nshortly after he found himself in prison again, while he was still angry about the\n\ncircumstances although he wasn’t any longer. Appellant thought he threw the letter away\n\nbut the corrections officer found it inside a kite in his legal paperwork. Appellant denied\n\nknowing who the letter was about because he “wrote so many letters” and didn’t know\n\nwhich one specifically Butler referred to. Appellant admitted he wrote the letter, but\n\ndenied it was addressed or sent to “Chizzle.” When asked who he wanted to kidnap,\n\nappellant said it could have been anyone because he was at first angry and venting about\n\nkidnapping anyone associated with his cases. Appellant said he always had the ability to\n\n“abort” a scheme and Butler responded that he had already conspired to commit the\n\nscheme. Appellant’s response was that he could ask anyone to do anything but no one\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                            16\n\n\nwould follow through because he had no money or other means of making anyone follow\n\nthrough.\n\n       {¶24} Appellant denied having access to a cell phone and said he was careful\n\nabout what he wrote in his outgoing mail or JPays because in 2010 he “caught a case”\n\nfor writing to a relative and asking her to bring contraband into a prison. Butler then told\n\nhim they found a second letter, similar to the first, connected with a cell phone and\n\ninvestigators had a search warrant to download the contents of the phone. Appellant said\n\nhe would be glad for them to do so because there would be no evidence tying him in any\n\nway to the cell phone.\n\n       {¶25} Butler interviewed appellant again on August 11, 2015, and this time\n\nappellant was not as cordial because law enforcement had been “harassing” his friends\n\nand family. Butler asked appellant more about the circumstances of the discovery of the\n\n“C-Hood” letter and appellant denied passing the letter to Spy or Hayes. Butler responded\n\nthat one of the inmates told him appellant gave them the letter to mail out of the facility,\n\nand appellant said Butler was lying because he had no connection with the other inmates.\n\nAppellant denied passing the “C-Hood” letter to anyone else and said he had no idea how\n\nit came to be in the possession of other inmates.\n\n       {¶26} Appellee called Christian Brown, a Man.C.I. inmate, to testify against\n\nappellant at trial. Brown is associated with the “Bloods” and although it is against gang\n\nrules to snitch, he felt it was also against gang rules to go after a prosecutor’s family\n\nmembers, thus when he became aware of appellant’s plot to kidnap a prosecutor’s son,\n\nhe contacted investigators. Brown also admitted he hoped cooperation would lead to\n\nintervention by appellee to help him gain judicial release or transfer to a different facility.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                          17\n\n\n       {¶27} Brown had been incarcerated in a limited-movement pod with appellant and\n\nwhile talking to another gang member, Brown heard about the plot to kidnap Hanlin’s son.\n\nBrown said he was “kicking it” with appellant in the facility and they smoked marijuana\n\ntogether.   Appellant said he needed another inmate to set up a three-way phone\n\nconversation for him so he could talk to someone on the street in Steubenville. Brown\n\nfacilitated the conversation. Appellant told Brown the names of two people who would\n\nhelp him, including “Jay Rock” and “Cut Cut.” “Cut Cut” was supposed to handle the plot\n\noutside the prison and hold the victim until appellant’s charges were dropped. Appellant\n\ntold Brown two of his letters had been intercepted.\n\n       {¶28} Appellant testified on his own behalf at trial and denied having any\n\nconversations with Christian Brown, much less smoking marijuana with him. Appellant\n\nsaid he wrote many letters similar to those found in this case, and that he offered the\n\nother letters to corrections officers but they weren’t interested. He said the letters were\n\nwritten shortly after he arrived at Man.C.I. in June 2014, and he didn’t realize the letters\n\nstill existed because he thought he had thrown them away. Appellant said the “Chizzle”\n\nletter never left his cell, and he had no idea how the “C-Hood” letter came to be in the cell\n\nof Spy and Hayes. Appellant testified Spy was his neighbor in the facility before he was\n\nmoved, but denied giving the letter to Spy to mail. Appellant insisted the letters were\n\nwritten to “vent” his anger and that he never actually communicated about the details of\n\nthe kidnapping plot to anyone, including Freeman, his father, or any other family\n\nmembers. He disagreed with Hanlin’s identifications of people in the pictures found in the\n\ncell phone, including of Dominique Freeman. He also testified he was no longer involved\n\nin any gang and that he didn’t take part in any gang activities at Man.C.I., although he\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                        18\n\n\nadmitted he was ticketed for a gang fight after he was purportedly “jumped out” of the\n\ngang.12\n\n        {¶29} Appellant was charged by indictment as follows: Count I, conspiracy to\n\ncommit kidnapping pursuant to R.C. 2923.01(A)(1)/2905.01(A)(1) and/or (A)(5), a felony\n\nof the second degree; Count II, attempted kidnapping pursuant to R.C. 2923.02(A) and\n\n2905.01(A)(10 and/or (A)(5), a felony of the second degree; Count III, attempted extortion\n\npursuant to R.C. 2905.11(A)(1) and/ or (A)(2) and/or (A)(4), a felony of the fourth degree;\n\nand Count IV, falsification pursuant to R.C. 2921.13(A)(3), a misdemeanor of the first\n\ndegree.\n\n        {¶30} Appellant entered pleas of not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial by\n\njury. The trial court dismissed Count I, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, “for failure to\n\nallege an overt act in the indictment.” Appellant was found guilty upon the remaining\n\ncounts. The trial court proceeded to immediately sentence appellant to consecutive\n\nprison terms of 8 years upon Count II and 18 months upon Count III, concurrent with a\n\njail term of 6 months upon Count IV.\n\n        {¶31} Appellant now appeals from the trial court’s Sentencing Entry of July 20,\n\n2016.\n\n        {¶32} Appellant raises two assignments of error:\n\n\n\n\n12Appellant contended he was beaten out, or “jumped out,” of the Crips on December 24,\n2015.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                          19\n\n\n                               ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n       {¶33} “I.

The relevant inquiry is whether, after\n\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                         20\n\n\n       {¶37} In determining whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence, the court of appeals functions as the “thirteenth juror,” and after “reviewing the\n\nentire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility\n\nof witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly\n\nlost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must\n\nbe overturned and a new trial ordered.” State v.

Those sections state:\n\n                     (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, or, in the case\n\n              of a victim under the age of thirteen or mentally incompetent, by any\n\n              means, shall remove another from the place where the other person\n\n              is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the\n\n              following purposes:\n\n                     (1) To hold for ransom, or as a shield or hostage;\n\n                     * * * *.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                     21\n\n\n                    (5) To hinder, impede, or obstruct a function of government,\n\n             or to force any action or concession on the part of governmental\n\n             authority;\n\n                    * * * *.\n\n      {¶39} Appellant was also found guilty upon one count of attempted extortion\n\npursuant to R.C. 2905.11(A)(1) and/or (A)(2) and/or (A)(4). Those sections state:\n\n                    (A) No person, with purpose to obtain any valuable thing or\n\n             valuable benefit or to induce another to do an unlawful act, shall do\n\n             any of the following:\n\n                    (1) Threaten to commit any felony;\n\n                    (2) Threaten to commit any offense of violence;\n\n                    * * * *.\n\n                    (4) Utter or threaten any calumny against any person;\n\n                    * * * *.\n\nAppellant argues his convictions are against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the\n\nevidence because there is no evidence he took any substantial step to cause the cell\n\nphone and the “C-Hood” letter to be found in another inmate’s cell, and there is no\n\nevidence he communicated the plan to kidnap the victim to anyone else. We disagree\n\nwith appellant’s characterization of the evidence and his resulting arguments.\n\n      {¶40} We find the existence of the plan detailed in the letters and the\n\ncircumstantial evidence of the movement of the second letter to constitute “substantial\n\nsteps” which strongly corroborates appellant’s purpose in carrying out the kidnapping\n\nscheme. The Ohio Supreme Court has elaborated on the statutory definition of “attempt”\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                           22\n\n\nin R.C. 2923.02(A) as follows: “A ‘criminal attempt’ is when one purposely does or omits\n\nto do anything which is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of\n\nconduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.” State v.

A “substantial step”\n\nrequires conduct that is “strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.” Id. “[T]his\n\nstandard does properly direct attention to overt acts of the defendant which convincingly\n\ndemonstrate a firm purpose to commit a crime, while allowing police intervention * * * in\n\norder to prevent the crime when the criminal intent becomes apparent.” Id. at 132.\n\n       {¶41} We find the facts of the instant case to be similar to those of State v.

It is readily apparent there\n\nwas discussion about Freeman’s access to information on the victim’s whereabouts.\n\n       {¶42} Appellant's acts— soliciting his criminal associates to kidnap and hold John\n\nDoe, providing those associates with information about Doe’s whereabouts at school,\n\npassing the C-Hood letter on to other inmates for transmission from the prison, and\n\nproviding associates with the necessary contact information for the named co-\n\nconspirators who will undertake the plot, and transferring the letter to other inmates for\n\ntransmission from the facility—strongly corroborate his criminal purpose, and therefore\n\nconstitute a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the kidnapping\n\fRichland County, Case No. 16CA52                                                             23\n\nof John Doe and the extorting of Hanlin. See, Group, supra, 2002-Ohio-7247 at ¶ 103.\n\nHere, the steps taken by appellant convincingly demonstrate a firm purpose to commit\n\nthe crimes of kidnapping and extortion. State v. Smith, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2011-CR-\n\n3470, 2012-Ohio-2956, ¶ 38. We conclude that there was sufficient competent and\n\ncredible evidence presented to the jury to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat appellee had proven each element of each of the offenses.\n\n       {¶43} Whether the woman in the photo on the cell phone is Freeman, and whether\n\nappellant transmitted the “C-Hood” letter and the cell phone to Spy’s cell, were for the jury\n\nto decide. Smith, supra, 2012-Ohio-2956 at ¶ 40. Ultimately, “the reviewing court must\n\ndetermine whether the appellant or the appellee provided the more believable evidence,\n\nbut must not completely substitute its judgment for that of the original trier of fact ‘unless\n\nit is patently apparent that the fact finder lost its way.’” Id., quoting State v.
