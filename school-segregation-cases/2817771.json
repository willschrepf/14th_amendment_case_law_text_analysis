SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n      Allstate Insurance Company (“Allstate”) sued a consortium of telemar-\nketing companies, chiropractic clinics, and affiliated law offices spanning\nseveral states, contending that they had violated the Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”). A jury returned a verdict in Allstate’s\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769     Page: 2   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\nfavor, leading to a sizable award and attorney’s fees. The defendants contend\nthat the evidence was insufficient under RICO, that some claims were barred\nby the statute of limitations, and that the district court erred in admitting\nAllstate’s expert witnesses. Allstate challenges the district court’s decision not\nto award prejudgment interest and to reduce the fee award. We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n      The scheme to defraud insurance companies such as Allstate aimed to\nidentify persons who had been in vehicle accidents but were not at fault. The\ndefendants would convince them to receive unnecessary chiropractic services,\nthen would file third-party claims against the at-fault party’s insurer.\n\n      First, the participants had to identify potential claimants.         Michael\nPlambeck owned Media Placement Services (“MPS”), a telemarketing firm,\nwhich Douglas Friedman managed. Defendant Jennifer Giessner was Plam-\nbeck’s Controller.   MPS employees purchased police accident reports and\nscoured them for not-at-fault victims who met certain criteria, usually low-\nincome individuals without health insurance.\n\n      Once a potential patient was identified, an MPS employee would call to\nwarn that the person may have suffered trauma whose ill effects might not be\napparent for weeks. The telemarketer would offer the victim a free spinal\nexam to determine whether he was injured. The caller would assure the pro-\nspective patient that the appointment would be at no cost to him or his insurer,\nbut the charges would be billed to the at-fault party. The caller would schedule\nan appointment at a clinic that was part of Chiropractic Strategies Group\n(“CSG”), which Plambeck owned; defendants Michael Capobianco and Paul\nGrindstaff were Clinic Partners. At a clinic, the patient would sign several\nforms, including an Assignment of Benefits that allowed the clinic to collect\ndirectly from the insurer.\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769    Page: 3      Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\n      A Plambeck-trained chiropractor would administer the free examina-\ntion, at the end of which the chiropractor often ordered x-rays. The x-rays often\nwere marked up with lines and circles purporting to show that the patient\nneeded treatment, although the markings had little or no diagnostic value.\nMany of the x-rays were of poor quality, with some rendered unreadable by\nunderexposure or overexposure and others made difficult to parse by the pres-\nence of buttons, clips, zippers, and belt buckles. Even though the chiropractor\ndeemed x-rays necessary, the useless ones were not retaken, but the insurer\nwas still billed for them.\n\n      The chiropractors almost always prescribed the same treatment: hot and\ncold packs, electrical stimulation, massages, and other passive modalities.\nPatients received the treatment for the same length of time—daily for two\nweeks, then three times a week. After sixteen or twenty visits, the chiropractor\noften deemed the patient cured without a reexamination or follow-up testing.\n\n      When a patient came to a clinic, he was usually referred, at Plambeck’s\ndirection, to a law firm with substantial ties to Plambeck. Many of those firms\nwere funded and run by two companies, Professional Management Group LLC\n(“PMG”) and Law Office Network LLC (“LON”), which were owned by Randall\nToca and funded by Plambeck. PMG was in the same Plambeck-owned build-\ning with MPS and CSG, and Plambeck exercised significant oversight over\nPMG employees.       The patient would meet with a lawyer, but nonlawyer\nemployees drafted demand letters on firm letterhead, mailed them to insurers,\nand negotiated settlements.\n\n      Settlement checks were sent to local offices, then forwarded to headquar-\nters. The case managers prepared deposits to the representative firms’ trust\naccounts, from which Toca disbursed the funds to various entities. Often the\naccident victim received less than one-third of the funds.\n\n                                       3\n\f     Case: 14-10574      Document: 00513196769        Page: 4    Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-10574\n                                           II.\n      After beginning a two-year investigation in 2005, Allstate sued Plam-\nbeck and more than sixty other individuals and entities, alleging violations of\nfederal and state RICO statutes, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and unjust\nenrichment. Allstate sought to recover the amount it customarily allowed for\nservices Plambeck’s clinics had provided to 721 patients. During trial, Allstate\ndropped a number of cases, and the district court dismissed others, ultimately\nreducing the contested insurance claims to 555.\n\n      After a five-week trial and four days of deliberations, the jury found that\nthe defendants had violated the federal RICO statute and Ohio’s RICO statute,\nhad committed fraud, and were unjustly enriched in 391 of the 555 cases.\nAlmost all of the 391 cases involved missing or deficient x-rays.\n\n      Although the jury found liability on multiple theories, it awarded dam-\nages only for the federal and Ohio RICO violations and not for fraud or unjust\nenrichment.     Actual damages assessed on the appealing defendants were\n$945,593, and the court assessed treble damages of $2,836,779. 1 The court\ndenied Allstate’s request for prejudgment interest on the actual-damages\namount and denied defendants’ motion for a new trial.\n\n      Allstate moved for attorney’s fees of $1,903,006.75. The court held that\nthe hourly rate and total hours were appropriate, but it reduced the award\nbecause Allstate had prevailed on only 391 of the original 721 disputed claims.\nBecause Allstate proved only about 54% of its underlying claims, the court\nawarded only 54% of the requested fees, or $1,027,623.65.\n\n\n\n\n      1  The jury also awarded damages for the Ohio RICO claims, which the court trebled,\nbut the court ordered that the defendants would not recover doubly on the federal and Ohio\nRICO claims.\n                                            4\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769      Page: 5   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\n                                       III.\n      Both sides appeal. The defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evi-\ndence supporting the existence of a RICO enterprise, causation, and damages;\nadditionally, they assert that some claims are barred by limitations and that\nthe court erred in admitting certain of Allstate’s experts. Both the Ohio RICO\nclaims and the attorney’s-fee award are contested, but those challenges rise\nand fall on the success of the federal RICO claims.\n\n      Allstate’s cross-appeal asserts that the district court abused its discre-\ntion in not awarding prejudgment interest and in reducing the total attorney’s-\nfee request. Allstate presses a contingent cross-appeal: If we grant relief to\nthe defendants, Allstate disputes the district court’s dismissing its misrepre-\nsentation claims and excluding certain evidence and questions from the jury\ncharge and verdict form.\n\n                                       IV.\n      We review de novo a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\nAllstate Ins. Co. v. Receivable Fin. Co., 501 F.3d 398, 405 (5th Cir. 2007). We\nreverse a denial only if there is “no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a\nreasonable jury to find for a party.” Id. “[W]e view all evidence and draw all\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict” and reverse\nonly when the evidence and inferences “point so strongly in favor of the movant\nthat a rational jury could not reach a contrary verdict.” Id.\n\n      RICO makes it unlawful for “any person employed by or associated with\nany enterprise . . . to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the con-\nduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.”   18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).    The defendants’ first challenge is to the\nexistence of an enterprise. RICO defines an enterprise as “any individual,\n\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769        Page: 6   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-10574\npartnership, corporation, association or other legal entity, and any union or\ngroup of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.”             Id.\n§ 1961(4). At trial, Allstate contended that the various defendants fell into the\nlast category—that they were an enterprise “associated in fact.”\n\n      An association-in-fact enterprise “(1) must have an existence separate\nand apart from the pattern of racketeering, (2) must be an ongoing organi-\nzation and (3) its members must function as a continuing unit as shown by a\nhierarchical or consensual decision making structure.” Calcasieu Marine Nat’l\nBank v. Grant, 943 F.2d 1453, 1461 (5th Cir. 1991). RICO does not require\nthan an enterprise be a separate business-like entity. Boyle v. United States,\n556 U.S. 938, 945 (2009). Instead, an association-in-fact enterprise includes “a\ngroup of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a\ncourse of conduct,” and that enterprise can be proved with “evidence of an\nongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various\nassociates function as a continuing unit.” Id. at 944–45. A pattern of racke-\nteering activity does not, by itself, necessarily show that an enterprise exists.\nSee United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981). But the evidence estab-\nlishing the enterprise and the pattern of racketeering may “coalesce.” Boyle,\n556 U.S. at 947.\n\n      The linchpin of enterprise status is the continuity or ongoing nature of\nthe association. Calcesieu Marine Nat’l Bank, 943 F.2d at 1462. “The enter-\nprise must have continuity of its structure and personnel, which links the\ndefendants, and a common or shared purpose.” Id. The Supreme Court has\nsimilarly identified those three structural features as indispensable to an\nassociation-in-fact   enterprise:   “a   purpose,    relationships   among     those\nassociated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these\nassociates to pursue the enterprise’s purpose.” Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946.\n\n                                         6\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769      Page: 7   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\n      The defendants contend that the shared-purpose requirement was not\nsatisfied because the only shared purpose was to carry out the pattern of racke-\nteering; no associated-in-fact enterprise exists if the shared purpose was\nmerely to conduct the racketeering, they assert. They failed to raise that chal-\nlenge, however, until their Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) motion after\nthe verdict. Consequently, our review on that point is for plain error. Flowers\nv. S. Reg’l Physician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 238 (5th Cir. 2001). “If any\nevidence exists that supports the verdict, it will be upheld.” Id.\n\n      The defendants point to no binding authority that an enterprise must\nhave a purpose besides committing racketeering activity. Instead, they assert\nthat there must be a different purpose because a RICO enterprise cannot be\nthe pattern of racketeering itself. But in Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583, the Court\nrejected a similar challenge that would have excluded from “enterprise” those\nentities pursuing solely unlawful ends. Id.\n\n      Even with “wholly illegitimate enterprises such as an illegal gambling\nbusiness or a loan-sharking operation” the government must still satisfy differ-\nent legal standards to show the existence of the enterprise and the pattern of\nracketeering. Id. at 583–85. Although the evidence proving the two will some-\ntimes coalesce, the government still has to satisfy the organizational metric of\nthe enterprise (including continuity and common purpose) and the statutorily\nenumerated predicate offenses. Id. at 583. There is thus no impermissible\ncollapsing of the distinction between the enterprise and the pattern of racke-\nteering. The Sixth Circuit examined Boyle and held that an association can\nsatisfy the enterprise requirement under RICO even if its sole purpose is to\ncarry out a pattern of racketeering. Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc.,\n694 F.3d 783, 794–95 (6th Cir. 2012). If the district court committed an error,\nit certainly was not plain.\n\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769     Page: 8   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\n      In another challenge to the common-purpose requirement, the defen-\ndants contend the evidence was insufficient to show that Toca and Friedman\nshared the fraudulent purpose of the enterprise. The defendants assert that,\nbecause those two were involved with only some of the claimants, Allstate\nfailed to show that they shared that purpose.\n\n      Establishing that Toca and Friedman had limited involvement does not\nseriously cast doubt on the conclusion that they shared in the enterprise’s pur-\npose. The jury was presented with sufficient evidence to conclude that they\nwere actively involved and shared the goal of making money through the\nscheme. PMG, MPS, and CSG shared a building and regularly saw staff switch\nbetween entities. Plambeck loaned money to Toca for the law offices, directed\nPMG’s employees regarding settlements, and divided the proceeds. The jury\nhad plenty of evidence to find that Toca was a willing participant in the\nscheme. The same is true for Friedman, who ran the solicitation side of the\nenterprise, following Plambeck’s directions and signing up patients.\n\n      By highlighting Toca’s and Friedman’s limited roles, the defendants may\nbe contesting that they “conduct[ed] or participate[d], directly or indirectly, in\nthe conduct of [the] enterprise’s affairs.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Even if Toca and\nFriedman were not the main leaders, however, they qualify because they “par-\nticipate[d] in the operation or management of [the] enterprise.” Reves v. Ernst\n& Young, 507 U.S. 170, 84 (1993). “An enterprise is ‘operated’ not just by upper\nmanagement but also by lower rung participants in the enterprise who are\nunder the direction of upper management.” Id. It is evident that Toca and\nFriedman participated in managing the enterprise with their supervisory roles\nin their respective parts of the scheme, even if Plambeck was in charge.\n\n      Finally, focusing on the question whether the defendants engaged in a\npattern of racketeering, they assert that they lacked the requisite intent to\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 14-10574      Document: 00513196769   Page: 9   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\ndefraud.   Because the jury found liability only on those insurance claims\ninvolving bad x-rays, the defendants state that Allstate needed to show some\nnexus between the x-rays and Plambeck, Toca, and Friedman. If the defen-\ndants did not take, review, or know about the bad x-rays, how could they have\nthe requisite intent?\n\n      That contention has two flaws. First, although there is no evidence that\nFriedman, Toca, and Plambeck took any of the deficient or missing x-rays, cir-\ncumstantial evidence links them to the x-rays. And irrespective of how closely\ntied the three were to the direct handling of the x-rays, they were involved, in\nany event, with the supervision of the clinic and used its inadequate work to\nsupport the false claims for medical services. For example, Plambeck person-\nally trained new chiropractors at CSG’s Louisiana headquarters, teaching doc-\ntors to use x-rays as a sales tool. Toca was present at some of the training\nsessions. After the initial two-week session, Plambeck sent chiropractors for\nadditional training at the Dove Pointe clinic, which took a large portion of the\nbad x-rays. Furthermore, Friedman wrote the telemarketing scripts used to\nlure patients to the clinics and instructed telemarketers to target vulnerable\nindividuals. He was also head of marketing for CSG, which owned the clinics\nthat took the bad x-rays.\n\n      Second, the defendants misunderstand the nature of the predicate acts.\nAllstate’s theory at trial was that Friedman, Toca, and Plambeck had engaged\nin a pattern of mail and wire fraud. Both of those crimes, which constitute\npredicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), are broad. “The mail fraud statute\napplies to anyone who knowingly causes to be delivered by mail anything for\nthe purpose of executing any scheme or artifice to defraud.” United States v.\nWhitfield, 590 F.3d 325, 355 (5th Cir. 2009) (internal citations and quotation\nmarks omitted). Similarly, wire fraud involves the use of, or causing the use\n\n                                       9\n\f   Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769     Page: 10   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\nof, wire communications in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. United States\nv. Stalnaker, 571 F.3d 428, 436 (5th Cir. 2009). “Once membership in a scheme\nto defraud is established, a knowing participant is liable for any wire\ncommunication which subsequently takes place or which previously took place\nin connection with the scheme.” Id.\n\n      It follows that Allstate needed to prove only that Friedman, Toca, and\nPlambeck had engaged in a scheme to defraud for which the use of the mail or\nwires was reasonably foreseeable. See Whitfield, 590 F.3d at 354–55. And, as\nwe have explained at length, Allstate did that. Plambeck’s entities, which\nFriedman and Toca ran, operated as a cohesive unit. The enterprise targeted\npoor and uneducated individuals, convinced them that they needed chiroprac-\ntic and legal services, and solicited payment for those services from insurers\nlike Allstate.   Based on the evidence that conversations with prospective\npatients were highly scripted and allowed for almost no deviation, the jury\ncould reasonably infer that the scheme was fraudulent and that using the mail\nor wire services was inevitable. As a result, it makes no difference that Fried-\nman, Toca, and Plambeck did not take the x-rays.\n\n                                      V.\n      Regarding causation, RICO provides civil remedies to “[a]ny person\ninjured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.”\n18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). An injured party must show that the violation was the\nbut-for and proximate cause of the injury. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem.\nCo., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008). In cases predicated on mail or wire fraud, reli-\nance is not necessary. Id.\n\n      The defendants contend that this case is a repeat of Receivable Finance,\nin which we overturned a verdict on a fraud claim because Allstate had not\n\n\n                                      10\n\f   Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769      Page: 11   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\nproduced evidence showing that it had relied on the defendant’s misrepresen-\ntations. That case, however, was predicated on common-law fraud, which has\na reliance requirement, and not on RICO or mail fraud. Receivable Fin.,\n501 F.3d at 406. As recognized in Bridge, 553 U.S. at 653, mail fraud and its\nplace in RICO framework are different from a case alleging common-law fraud,\nand one of the differences is the lack of a reliance requirement. In St. Germain\nv. Howard, 556 F.3d 261, 263 (5th Cir. 2009), we addressed Bridge and\nexpressly overruled the requirement that a RICO plaintiff show reliance.\n\n      Furthermore, the jury instructions stated the causation requirement in\nterms of proximate cause, not reliance, stating that proximate cause was pres-\nent if “the injury or damage was either a direct result or a reasonably probable\nconsequence of the act.” If the defendants wanted the jury to delve into issues\nof reliance, they should have challenged the instructions on that point.\n\n      The proper inquiry, then, is what constitutes proximate cause under\nRICO. The defendants contend that reliance is the only causal mechanism\npotentially at issue and thus should still be the proper metric. But we reject\nthat invitation to disregard Bridge and St. Germain.\n\n      The other courts of appeals to address RICO proximate cause have simi-\nlar proximate-cause definitions. The First Circuit identified directness as the\nprime directive of proximate cause and laid out three functional factors to help\nanalyze whether an injury was sufficiently direct: whether there are concerns\nabout proof resulting from the level of attenuation; avoiding multiple recover-\nies and the difficult apportionment calculations courts would have to make;\nand whether the societal interest in policing the injurious behavior justifies\nfinding proximate causation. In re Neurotonin Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig.,\n712 F.3d 21, 35–40 (1st Cir. 2013). The Sixth Circuit looks to whether “the\ndefendants’ fraudulent acts were a substantial and foreseeable cause of the\n\n                                      11\n\f    Case: 14-10574        Document: 00513196769          Page: 12     Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-10574\ninjuries alleged.” Brown v. Cassens Transp. Co., 546 F.3d 347, 357 (6th Cir.\n2008). And the Seventh Circuit similarly states that RICO proximate cause is\ndesigned for those situations “when too many unexpected things had to happen\nbetween the defendant’s wrongdoing and the plaintiff’s injury, in order for the\ninjury to occur.” BCS Servs., Inc. v. Heartwood 88, LLC, 637 F.3d 750, 754 (7th\nCir. 2011).\n\n      Regardless of how proximate cause is sliced, Allstate proved it. There is\nno plausible argument that the insurers were unforeseeable victims or other-\nwise wronged by the caprice of chance. The objective of the enterprise was to\ncollect from the insurance companies; the entire structure of the system, from\nthe screening for not-at-fault victims to the factory-efficient issuance of\ndemand letters, shows that Allstate’s paying up was not just incidental but\nwas the object of the collaboration. Allstate presented sufficient evidence to\nsatisfy the unchallenged jury instruction regarding proximate cause. 2\n\n                                              VI.\n      The defendants challenge the quantum of damages, claiming that All-\nstate failed to introduce evidence showing the payments made were solely for\nunnecessary chiropractic services. They posit that some of Allstate’s payments\ncould have been to cover expenses that were not the result of the defendants’\nfraud; some of the patients may have suffered injuries and been prescribed an\nappropriate treatment.\n\n      In Receivable Finance, 3 we faulted Allstate for failing to conduct a file-\nby-file determination of the damages amount and to present evidence showing\n\n\n      2   It appears undisputed that the “but-for” causation requirement is satisfied as well.\n      3 We assume arguendo that the same damages rule applies in this case as applied in\nReceivable Finance, which dealt with disgorgement as a remedy for state fraud claims that\nrequired proof of reliance.\n                                              12\n\f   Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769       Page: 13   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\nthat all of the treatment was unnecessary or inappropriate. On the latter\npoint, Allstate had produced evidence that some of the medical treatment for\nwhich it had paid was unnecessary, but without establishing that the payment\ncovered no necessary and appropriate treatment, Allstate’s damages were too\nspeculative. Receivable Fin., 501 F.3d at 414.\n\n      There is no such deficiency here. The court instructed the jury, in award-\ning damages, to distinguish between the portions of the bills generated for\nunreasonable or unnecessary services and those not generated for those ser-\nvices. Allstate had experts examine all of the files, not just a representative\nsample, and one of those witnesses testified that Allstate had internally item-\nized the elements of each settlement. The jury found liability on the claims for\nwhich there were deficient x-rays, and it was presented with testimony that a\nchiropractor could not both label an x-ray necessary and prescribe reasonable\nand necessary treatment in the absence of that x-ray.\n\n      The defendants had the chance to convince the jury that the insurance\nclaims included necessary and appropriate coverage, but they did not succeed.\nGiven our highly deferential standard of review and the evidence presented to\nshow the inappropriateness and unreasonableness of the entire course of\ntreatments prescribed by the chiropractors, this case does not suffer from the\nsame flaws as did Receivable Finance.\n\n                                     VII.\n      The defendants contend that the statute of limitations bars certain of\nAllstate’s claims and that the court erred in admitting Allstate’s experts.\nNeither argument avails the defendants.\n\n      The defendants urge that the four-year statute of limitations bars All-\nstate’s recovery on insurance settlements paid before March 6, 2004, because\n\n                                      13\n\f   Case: 14-10574      Document: 00513196769    Page: 14   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\nAllstate knew or should have known about those frauds. The defendants\nstated during trial, however, that they did not want limitations questions sub-\nmitted to the jury. That decision waived the right to have the jury make a\nfinding as to the defense. See McDaniel v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 987 F.2d 298,\n306 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n      The defendants challenge the admission of several expert witnesses,\nchiropractic experts who testified that chiropractic care was unnecessary for\nthe patients. The defendants state that the lack of “concrete, specific reference\nto any authoritative sources” means the testimony should have been excluded.\nThe district court, however, has broad discretion in its gatekeeping function\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 702, and an expert witness’s testimony (and\nits reliability) may be based on his personal and professional experience and\nhis own observation. Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 151–53\n(1999). The defendants’ conclusional statements regarding the impropriety of\nthe testimony do not establish that the district court abused its wide latitude\nin allowing the expert witnesses to testify based on professional experience.\n\n                                     VIII.\n      Allstate seeks an adjustment of the attorney’s-fee award. The district\ncourt held that, because Allstate had shown liability on only 391 of the 721\nunderlying insurance claims it had originally contested, fees should be\nproportionate.\n\n      Allstate posits three errors. First, the court treated Allstate as having\nbrought 721 discrete legal claims. Second, it used the proportionate approach\nto segregate between successful and unsuccessful claims, even though no such\nsegregation was necessary. And third, it baselessly concluded that each of\nthose claims should be treated as requiring equal resources.\n\n\n                                       14\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769      Page: 15    Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\n      Those challenges misconstrue what occurred. The court did not reduce\nthe award as a means of segregating claims or attempting to determine the\nresources actually used in pursuit of each basis of the final judgment. Indeed,\nthe court noted it was uncontested that Allstate’s lawyers’ hourly rates were\nreasonable, their work was necessary, and the time they spent was reasonable.\nInstead, the court stated that it was “exercis[ing] its discretion to reduce the\nfees sought by Plaintiffs commensurate with the level of success achieved by\nthem in this case.”\n\n      After calculating a reasonable rate and the proper number of hours, the\ncourt may adjust the award based on numerous factors, “including the impor-\ntant factor of the results obtained.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434\n(1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). If a plaintiff has achieved “only\npartial or limited success,” the court may reduce the award because the fees\nwould not reflect the scope of the relief, “even where the plaintiff’s claims were\ninterrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith.” Id. at 435–36. The court\nstated that it was reducing the attorney’s-fee award to account for Allstate’s\nlevel of success, so we will examine its actions under that framework.\n\n      We are presented with two interrelated issues: Did the district court err\nin determining that the degree of Allstate’s success justified reducing the\naward? And did the court abuse its discretion in its method of calculating the\nnew award?\n\n      The first question is easier. We agree with the district court that Allstate\nrealized only limited success. Although a plaintiff must obtain merely some\nrelief to be the prevailing party, the crucial factor in determining success is the\nrelief obtained. For example, if a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages, the\nproper fee usually is none at all, even though the plaintiff has won his case.\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 115 (1992). Similarly, a plaintiff’s victory in a\n\n                                        15\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769       Page: 16   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10574\nRICO claim is a necessary condition to the award of fees, but the appropriate\namount is determined in part by the plaintiff’s success in obtaining the relief\nit pursued. Allstate prevailed on its RICO claim and the damages award was\nsizable, but it failed to convince the jury on many of the underlying insurance\nclaims, and the amount of recovery was tied to the success on those claims. We\ntherefore agree with the district court that Allstate’s fees appropriately could\nbe reduced.\n\n      The second question is more difficult. How do we measure Allstate’s\ndegree of success? The court may not use “a mathematical approach comparing\nthe total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon.”\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 435 n.11. An award should not be reduced merely because\nthe plaintiff prevailed on only one of several alternative grounds for the same\nrelief. Id. at 435.\n\n      Allstate contends that the district court used a proscribed mathematical\napproach when it reduced the fee award to reflect the ratio of insurance claims\non which Allstate prevailed. But the Supreme Court did not categorically bar\nthe use of math. The court’s mathematical approach was different in kind from\nthe prohibited penalizing of alternative arguments or substitute remedies.\nAllstate has not identified why the proportionate approach was a poor measure\nof the degree of success, nor has it proposed an alternative means of calibrating\nthe fee award to reflect its limited success. “There is no precise rule or formula\nfor making these determinations,” and “[t]he court necessarily has discretion\nin making this equitable judgment.” Id. at 436–37. The use of the proportion\nbetween the number of disputed claims and the success on those claims was\nnot an abuse of that discretion.\n\n                                       IX.\n      The district court declined to award prejudgment interest, stating that\n                                       16\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769       Page: 17   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\nthe decision was within its discretion. It offered no other justification, but it\ndid cite two district-court decisions that had denied prejudgment interest in\nRICO cases. The reasoning in both was that RICO’s treble damages suffici-\nently offset the cost of being temporarily deprived of the recovered funds, mak-\ning prejudgment interest unnecessary to mitigate the cost of that deprivation.\nSee La. Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 642 F. Supp. 781, 811\n(E.D. La. 1986); Vanderbilt Mortg. & Fin., Inc. v. Flores, 2011 WL 767163, at *3\nn.3 (S.D. Tex. Feb 25, 2011). It is safe to say that the district court denied\nprejudgment interest for the same reason.\n\n      We have “a strong presumption in favor of awarding pre-judgment\ninterest.” United States v. Ocean Bulk Ships, Inc., 248 F.3d 331, 344 (5th Cir.\n2001). “Courts should award prejudgment interest whenever a certain sum is\ninvolved.” Thomas v. Tex. Dep’t of Crim. Justice, 297 F.3d 361, 372 (5th Cir.\n2002). But even where prejudgment interest is indisputably available, “the\ndecision to award such interest rests within the sound discretion of the district\ncourt,” and we “will not overturn the district court’s determination in the\nabsence of an abuse of discretion.” Sellers v. Delgado Cmty. Coll., 839 F.2d\n1132, 1140 (5th Cir. 1988).\n\n      The court did not abuse its discretion in denying prejudgment interest.\nIt could reasonably have concluded that Allstate’s recovery of treble damages\nsufficiently offset the loss it suffered from being deprived of the use of its money\ncaused by the fraud. Treble damages under RICO are partly punitive, allowing\nrecovery to “exceed actual provable damages.” Gil Ramirez Grp., L.L.C. v.\nHous. Indep. Sch. Dist., 786 F.3d 400, 412–13 (5th Cir. 2015). Allstate has\nalready been made more than whole on the damages it could prove, and it has\nnot shown that the prejudgment interest would exceed that extra recovery. We\nagree with the Second Circuit that a district court does not necessarily abuse\n\n                                        17\n\f    Case: 14-10574      Document: 00513196769       Page: 18    Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-10574\nits discretion in relying on the extracompensatory nature of RICO treble dam-\nages in denying prejudgment interest.

SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n      Allstate Insurance Company (“Allstate”) sued a consortium of telemar-\nketing companies, chiropractic clinics, and affiliated law offices spanning\nseveral states, contending that they had violated the Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”). A jury returned a verdict in Allstate’s\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769     Page: 2   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\nfavor, leading to a sizable award and attorney’s fees. The defendants contend\nthat the evidence was insufficient under RICO, that some claims were barred\nby the statute of limitations, and that the district court erred in admitting\nAllstate’s expert witnesses. Allstate challenges the district court’s decision not\nto award prejudgment interest and to reduce the fee award. We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n      The scheme to defraud insurance companies such as Allstate aimed to\nidentify persons who had been in vehicle accidents but were not at fault. The\ndefendants would convince them to receive unnecessary chiropractic services,\nthen would file third-party claims against the at-fault party’s insurer.\n\n      First, the participants had to identify potential claimants.         Michael\nPlambeck owned Media Placement Services (“MPS”), a telemarketing firm,\nwhich Douglas Friedman managed. Defendant Jennifer Giessner was Plam-\nbeck’s Controller.   MPS employees purchased police accident reports and\nscoured them for not-at-fault victims who met certain criteria, usually low-\nincome individuals without health insurance.\n\n      Once a potential patient was identified, an MPS employee would call to\nwarn that the person may have suffered trauma whose ill effects might not be\napparent for weeks. The telemarketer would offer the victim a free spinal\nexam to determine whether he was injured. The caller would assure the pro-\nspective patient that the appointment would be at no cost to him or his insurer,\nbut the charges would be billed to the at-fault party. The caller would schedule\nan appointment at a clinic that was part of Chiropractic Strategies Group\n(“CSG”), which Plambeck owned; defendants Michael Capobianco and Paul\nGrindstaff were Clinic Partners. At a clinic, the patient would sign several\nforms, including an Assignment of Benefits that allowed the clinic to collect\ndirectly from the insurer.\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769    Page: 3      Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\n      A Plambeck-trained chiropractor would administer the free examina-\ntion, at the end of which the chiropractor often ordered x-rays. The x-rays often\nwere marked up with lines and circles purporting to show that the patient\nneeded treatment, although the markings had little or no diagnostic value.\nMany of the x-rays were of poor quality, with some rendered unreadable by\nunderexposure or overexposure and others made difficult to parse by the pres-\nence of buttons, clips, zippers, and belt buckles. Even though the chiropractor\ndeemed x-rays necessary, the useless ones were not retaken, but the insurer\nwas still billed for them.\n\n      The chiropractors almost always prescribed the same treatment: hot and\ncold packs, electrical stimulation, massages, and other passive modalities.\nPatients received the treatment for the same length of time—daily for two\nweeks, then three times a week. After sixteen or twenty visits, the chiropractor\noften deemed the patient cured without a reexamination or follow-up testing.\n\n      When a patient came to a clinic, he was usually referred, at Plambeck’s\ndirection, to a law firm with substantial ties to Plambeck. Many of those firms\nwere funded and run by two companies, Professional Management Group LLC\n(“PMG”) and Law Office Network LLC (“LON”), which were owned by Randall\nToca and funded by Plambeck. PMG was in the same Plambeck-owned build-\ning with MPS and CSG, and Plambeck exercised significant oversight over\nPMG employees.       The patient would meet with a lawyer, but nonlawyer\nemployees drafted demand letters on firm letterhead, mailed them to insurers,\nand negotiated settlements.\n\n      Settlement checks were sent to local offices, then forwarded to headquar-\nters. The case managers prepared deposits to the representative firms’ trust\naccounts, from which Toca disbursed the funds to various entities. Often the\naccident victim received less than one-third of the funds.\n\n                                       3\n\f     Case: 14-10574      Document: 00513196769        Page: 4    Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-10574\n                                           II.\n      After beginning a two-year investigation in 2005, Allstate sued Plam-\nbeck and more than sixty other individuals and entities, alleging violations of\nfederal and state RICO statutes, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and unjust\nenrichment. Allstate sought to recover the amount it customarily allowed for\nservices Plambeck’s clinics had provided to 721 patients. During trial, Allstate\ndropped a number of cases, and the district court dismissed others, ultimately\nreducing the contested insurance claims to 555.\n\n      After a five-week trial and four days of deliberations, the jury found that\nthe defendants had violated the federal RICO statute and Ohio’s RICO statute,\nhad committed fraud, and were unjustly enriched in 391 of the 555 cases.\nAlmost all of the 391 cases involved missing or deficient x-rays.\n\n      Although the jury found liability on multiple theories, it awarded dam-\nages only for the federal and Ohio RICO violations and not for fraud or unjust\nenrichment.     Actual damages assessed on the appealing defendants were\n$945,593, and the court assessed treble damages of $2,836,779. 1 The court\ndenied Allstate’s request for prejudgment interest on the actual-damages\namount and denied defendants’ motion for a new trial.\n\n      Allstate moved for attorney’s fees of $1,903,006.75. The court held that\nthe hourly rate and total hours were appropriate, but it reduced the award\nbecause Allstate had prevailed on only 391 of the original 721 disputed claims.\nBecause Allstate proved only about 54% of its underlying claims, the court\nawarded only 54% of the requested fees, or $1,027,623.65.\n\n\n\n\n      1  The jury also awarded damages for the Ohio RICO claims, which the court trebled,\nbut the court ordered that the defendants would not recover doubly on the federal and Ohio\nRICO claims.\n                                            4\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769      Page: 5   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\n                                       III.\n      Both sides appeal. The defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evi-\ndence supporting the existence of a RICO enterprise, causation, and damages;\nadditionally, they assert that some claims are barred by limitations and that\nthe court erred in admitting certain of Allstate’s experts. Both the Ohio RICO\nclaims and the attorney’s-fee award are contested, but those challenges rise\nand fall on the success of the federal RICO claims.\n\n      Allstate’s cross-appeal asserts that the district court abused its discre-\ntion in not awarding prejudgment interest and in reducing the total attorney’s-\nfee request. Allstate presses a contingent cross-appeal: If we grant relief to\nthe defendants, Allstate disputes the district court’s dismissing its misrepre-\nsentation claims and excluding certain evidence and questions from the jury\ncharge and verdict form.\n\n                                       IV.\n      We review de novo a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\nAllstate Ins.

The defendants’ first challenge is to the\nexistence of an enterprise. RICO defines an enterprise as “any individual,\n\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769        Page: 6   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-10574\npartnership, corporation, association or other legal entity, and any union or\ngroup of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.”             Id.\n§ 1961(4). At trial, Allstate contended that the various defendants fell into the\nlast category—that they were an enterprise “associated in fact.”\n\n      An association-in-fact enterprise “(1) must have an existence separate\nand apart from the pattern of racketeering, (2) must be an ongoing organi-\nzation and (3) its members must function as a continuing unit as shown by a\nhierarchical or consensual decision making structure.” Calcasieu Marine Nat’l\nBank v.

Instead, an association-in-fact enterprise includes “a\ngroup of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a\ncourse of conduct,” and that enterprise can be proved with “evidence of an\nongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various\nassociates function as a continuing unit.” Id. at 944–45. A pattern of racke-\nteering activity does not, by itself, necessarily show that an enterprise exists.\nSee United States v. Turkette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110529\"><a href=\"/opinion/110529/united-states-v-turkette/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583 (1981). But the evidence estab-\nlishing the enterprise and the pattern of racketeering may “coalesce.” Boyle,\n556 U.S. at 947.\n\n      The linchpin of enterprise status is the continuity or ongoing nature of\nthe association. Calcesieu Marine Nat’l Bank, 943 F.2d at 1462. “The enter-\nprise must have continuity of its structure and personnel, which links the\ndefendants, and a common or shared purpose.” Id. The Supreme Court has\nsimilarly identified those three structural features as indispensable to an\nassociation-in-fact   enterprise:   “a   purpose,    relationships   among     those\nassociated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these\nassociates to pursue the enterprise’s purpose.” Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946.\n\n                                         6\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769      Page: 7   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\n      The defendants contend that the shared-purpose requirement was not\nsatisfied because the only shared purpose was to carry out the pattern of racke-\nteering; no associated-in-fact enterprise exists if the shared purpose was\nmerely to conduct the racketeering, they assert. They failed to raise that chal-\nlenge, however, until their Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) motion after\nthe verdict. Consequently, our review on that point is for plain error. Flowers\nv. S. Reg’l Physician Servs. Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772924\"><a href=\"/opinion/772924/sandra-spragis-flowers-v-southern-regional-physician-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238 (5th Cir. 2001). “If any\nevidence exists that supports the verdict, it will be upheld.” Id.\n\n      The defendants point to no binding authority that an enterprise must\nhave a purpose besides committing racketeering activity. Instead, they assert\nthat there must be a different purpose because a RICO enterprise cannot be\nthe pattern of racketeering itself. But in Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583, the Court\nrejected a similar challenge that would have excluded from “enterprise” those\nentities pursuing solely unlawful ends. Id.\n\n      Even with “wholly illegitimate enterprises such as an illegal gambling\nbusiness or a loan-sharking operation” the government must still satisfy differ-\nent legal standards to show the existence of the enterprise and the pattern of\nracketeering. Id. at 583–85. Although the evidence proving the two will some-\ntimes coalesce, the government still has to satisfy the organizational metric of\nthe enterprise (including continuity and common purpose) and the statutorily\nenumerated predicate offenses. Id. at 583. There is thus no impermissible\ncollapsing of the distinction between the enterprise and the pattern of racke-\nteering. The Sixth Circuit examined Boyle and held that an association can\nsatisfy the enterprise requirement under RICO even if its sole purpose is to\ncarry out a pattern of racketeering. Ouwinga v. Benistar 419 Plan Servs., Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794–95 (6th Cir. 2012). If the district court committed an error,\nit certainly was not plain.\n\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 14-10574     Document: 00513196769     Page: 8   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\n      In another challenge to the common-purpose requirement, the defen-\ndants contend the evidence was insufficient to show that Toca and Friedman\nshared the fraudulent purpose of the enterprise. The defendants assert that,\nbecause those two were involved with only some of the claimants, Allstate\nfailed to show that they shared that purpose.\n\n      Establishing that Toca and Friedman had limited involvement does not\nseriously cast doubt on the conclusion that they shared in the enterprise’s pur-\npose. The jury was presented with sufficient evidence to conclude that they\nwere actively involved and shared the goal of making money through the\nscheme. PMG, MPS, and CSG shared a building and regularly saw staff switch\nbetween entities. Plambeck loaned money to Toca for the law offices, directed\nPMG’s employees regarding settlements, and divided the proceeds. The jury\nhad plenty of evidence to find that Toca was a willing participant in the\nscheme. The same is true for Friedman, who ran the solicitation side of the\nenterprise, following Plambeck’s directions and signing up patients.\n\n      By highlighting Toca’s and Friedman’s limited roles, the defendants may\nbe contesting that they “conduct[ed] or participate[d], directly or indirectly, in\nthe conduct of [the] enterprise’s affairs.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Even if Toca and\nFriedman were not the main leaders, however, they qualify because they “par-\nticipate[d] in the operation or management of [the] enterprise.” Reves v. Ernst\n& Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112826\"><a href=\"/opinion/112826/reves-v-ernst-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1993). “An enterprise is ‘operated’ not just by upper\nmanagement but also by lower rung participants in the enterprise who are\nunder the direction of upper management.” Id. It is evident that Toca and\nFriedman participated in managing the enterprise with their supervisory roles\nin their respective parts of the scheme, even if Plambeck was in charge.\n\n      Finally, focusing on the question whether the defendants engaged in a\npattern of racketeering, they assert that they lacked the requisite intent to\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 14-10574      Document: 00513196769   Page: 9   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\ndefraud.   Because the jury found liability only on those insurance claims\ninvolving bad x-rays, the defendants state that Allstate needed to show some\nnexus between the x-rays and Plambeck, Toca, and Friedman. If the defen-\ndants did not take, review, or know about the bad x-rays, how could they have\nthe requisite intent?\n\n      That contention has two flaws. First, although there is no evidence that\nFriedman, Toca, and Plambeck took any of the deficient or missing x-rays, cir-\ncumstantial evidence links them to the x-rays. And irrespective of how closely\ntied the three were to the direct handling of the x-rays, they were involved, in\nany event, with the supervision of the clinic and used its inadequate work to\nsupport the false claims for medical services. For example, Plambeck person-\nally trained new chiropractors at CSG’s Louisiana headquarters, teaching doc-\ntors to use x-rays as a sales tool. Toca was present at some of the training\nsessions. After the initial two-week session, Plambeck sent chiropractors for\nadditional training at the Dove Pointe clinic, which took a large portion of the\nbad x-rays. Furthermore, Friedman wrote the telemarketing scripts used to\nlure patients to the clinics and instructed telemarketers to target vulnerable\nindividuals. He was also head of marketing for CSG, which owned the clinics\nthat took the bad x-rays.\n\n      Second, the defendants misunderstand the nature of the predicate acts.\nAllstate’s theory at trial was that Friedman, Toca, and Plambeck had engaged\nin a pattern of mail and wire fraud. Both of those crimes, which constitute\npredicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), are broad. “The mail fraud statute\napplies to anyone who knowingly causes to be delivered by mail anything for\nthe purpose of executing any scheme or artifice to defraud.” United States v.\nWhitfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433971\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433971/united-states-v-whitfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 (5th Cir. 2009) (internal citations and quotation\nmarks omitted).

See Whitfield, 590 F.3d at 354–55. And, as\nwe have explained at length, Allstate did that. Plambeck’s entities, which\nFriedman and Toca ran, operated as a cohesive unit. The enterprise targeted\npoor and uneducated individuals, convinced them that they needed chiroprac-\ntic and legal services, and solicited payment for those services from insurers\nlike Allstate.   Based on the evidence that conversations with prospective\npatients were highly scripted and allowed for almost no deviation, the jury\ncould reasonably infer that the scheme was fraudulent and that using the mail\nor wire services was inevitable. As a result, it makes no difference that Fried-\nman, Toca, and Plambeck did not take the x-rays.\n\n                                      V.\n      Regarding causation, RICO provides civil remedies to “[a]ny person\ninjured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.”\n18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).

That case, however, was predicated on common-law fraud, which has\na reliance requirement, and not on RICO or mail fraud. Receivable Fin.,\n501 F.3d at 406. As recognized in Bridge, 553 U.S. at 653, mail fraud and its\nplace in RICO framework are different from a case alleging common-law fraud,\nand one of the differences is the lack of a reliance requirement. In St. Germain\nv.

The defendants contend that reliance is the only causal mechanism\npotentially at issue and thus should still be the proper metric. But we reject\nthat invitation to disregard Bridge and St. Germain.\n\n      The other courts of appeals to address RICO proximate cause have simi-\nlar proximate-cause definitions. The First Circuit identified directness as the\nprime directive of proximate cause and laid out three functional factors to help\nanalyze whether an injury was sufficiently direct: whether there are concerns\nabout proof resulting from the level of attenuation; avoiding multiple recover-\nies and the difficult apportionment calculations courts would have to make;\nand whether the societal interest in policing the injurious behavior justifies\nfinding proximate causation.

And the Seventh Circuit similarly states that RICO proximate cause is\ndesigned for those situations “when too many unexpected things had to happen\nbetween the defendant’s wrongdoing and the plaintiff’s injury, in order for the\ninjury to occur.” BCS Servs., Inc. v.

There is\nno plausible argument that the insurers were unforeseeable victims or other-\nwise wronged by the caprice of chance. The objective of the enterprise was to\ncollect from the insurance companies; the entire structure of the system, from\nthe screening for not-at-fault victims to the factory-efficient issuance of\ndemand letters, shows that Allstate’s paying up was not just incidental but\nwas the object of the collaboration. Allstate presented sufficient evidence to\nsatisfy the unchallenged jury instruction regarding proximate cause. 2\n\n                                              VI.\n      The defendants challenge the quantum of damages, claiming that All-\nstate failed to introduce evidence showing the payments made were solely for\nunnecessary chiropractic services. They posit that some of Allstate’s payments\ncould have been to cover expenses that were not the result of the defendants’\nfraud; some of the patients may have suffered injuries and been prescribed an\nappropriate treatment.\n\n      In Receivable Finance, 3 we faulted Allstate for failing to conduct a file-\nby-file determination of the damages amount and to present evidence showing\n\n\n      2   It appears undisputed that the “but-for” causation requirement is satisfied as well.\n      3 We assume arguendo that the same damages rule applies in this case as applied in\nReceivable Finance, which dealt with disgorgement as a remedy for state fraud claims that\nrequired proof of reliance.\n                                              12\n\f   Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769       Page: 13   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\nthat all of the treatment was unnecessary or inappropriate. On the latter\npoint, Allstate had produced evidence that some of the medical treatment for\nwhich it had paid was unnecessary, but without establishing that the payment\ncovered no necessary and appropriate treatment, Allstate’s damages were too\nspeculative. Receivable Fin., 501 F.3d at 414.\n\n      There is no such deficiency here. The court instructed the jury, in award-\ning damages, to distinguish between the portions of the bills generated for\nunreasonable or unnecessary services and those not generated for those ser-\nvices. Allstate had experts examine all of the files, not just a representative\nsample, and one of those witnesses testified that Allstate had internally item-\nized the elements of each settlement. The jury found liability on the claims for\nwhich there were deficient x-rays, and it was presented with testimony that a\nchiropractor could not both label an x-ray necessary and prescribe reasonable\nand necessary treatment in the absence of that x-ray.\n\n      The defendants had the chance to convince the jury that the insurance\nclaims included necessary and appropriate coverage, but they did not succeed.\nGiven our highly deferential standard of review and the evidence presented to\nshow the inappropriateness and unreasonableness of the entire course of\ntreatments prescribed by the chiropractors, this case does not suffer from the\nsame flaws as did Receivable Finance.\n\n                                     VII.\n      The defendants contend that the statute of limitations bars certain of\nAllstate’s claims and that the court erred in admitting Allstate’s experts.\nNeither argument avails the defendants.\n\n      The defendants urge that the four-year statute of limitations bars All-\nstate’s recovery on insurance settlements paid before March 6, 2004, because\n\n                                      13\n\f   Case: 14-10574      Document: 00513196769    Page: 14   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10574\nAllstate knew or should have known about those frauds.

The defendants state that the lack of “concrete, specific reference\nto any authoritative sources” means the testimony should have been excluded.\nThe district court, however, has broad discretion in its gatekeeping function\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 702, and an expert witness’s testimony (and\nits reliability) may be based on his personal and professional experience and\nhis own observation.

Carmichael, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118271\"><a href=\"/opinion/118271/kumho-tire-co-v-carmichael/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 151–53\n(1999). The defendants’ conclusional statements regarding the impropriety of\nthe testimony do not establish that the district court abused its wide latitude\nin allowing the expert witnesses to testify based on professional experience.\n\n                                     VIII.\n      Allstate seeks an adjustment of the attorney’s-fee award. The district\ncourt held that, because Allstate had shown liability on only 391 of the 721\nunderlying insurance claims it had originally contested, fees should be\nproportionate.\n\n      Allstate posits three errors. First, the court treated Allstate as having\nbrought 721 discrete legal claims. Second, it used the proportionate approach\nto segregate between successful and unsuccessful claims, even though no such\nsegregation was necessary. And third, it baselessly concluded that each of\nthose claims should be treated as requiring equal resources.\n\n\n                                       14\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769      Page: 15    Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\n      Those challenges misconstrue what occurred. The court did not reduce\nthe award as a means of segregating claims or attempting to determine the\nresources actually used in pursuit of each basis of the final judgment. Indeed,\nthe court noted it was uncontested that Allstate’s lawyers’ hourly rates were\nreasonable, their work was necessary, and the time they spent was reasonable.\nInstead, the court stated that it was “exercis[ing] its discretion to reduce the\nfees sought by Plaintiffs commensurate with the level of success achieved by\nthem in this case.”\n\n      After calculating a reasonable rate and the proper number of hours, the\ncourt may adjust the award based on numerous factors, “including the impor-\ntant factor of the results obtained.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434\n(1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). If a plaintiff has achieved “only\npartial or limited success,” the court may reduce the award because the fees\nwould not reflect the scope of the relief, “even where the plaintiff’s claims were\ninterrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith.” Id. at 435–36. The court\nstated that it was reducing the attorney’s-fee award to account for Allstate’s\nlevel of success, so we will examine its actions under that framework.\n\n      We are presented with two interrelated issues: Did the district court err\nin determining that the degree of Allstate’s success justified reducing the\naward? And did the court abuse its discretion in its method of calculating the\nnew award?\n\n      The first question is easier. We agree with the district court that Allstate\nrealized only limited success. Although a plaintiff must obtain merely some\nrelief to be the prevailing party, the crucial factor in determining success is the\nrelief obtained. For example, if a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages, the\nproper fee usually is none at all, even though the plaintiff has won his case.\nFarrar v. Hobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (1992). Similarly, a plaintiff’s victory in a\n\n                                        15\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769       Page: 16   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10574\nRICO claim is a necessary condition to the award of fees, but the appropriate\namount is determined in part by the plaintiff’s success in obtaining the relief\nit pursued. Allstate prevailed on its RICO claim and the damages award was\nsizable, but it failed to convince the jury on many of the underlying insurance\nclaims, and the amount of recovery was tied to the success on those claims. We\ntherefore agree with the district court that Allstate’s fees appropriately could\nbe reduced.\n\n      The second question is more difficult. How do we measure Allstate’s\ndegree of success? The court may not use “a mathematical approach comparing\nthe total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon.”\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 435 n.11. An award should not be reduced merely because\nthe plaintiff prevailed on only one of several alternative grounds for the same\nrelief. Id. at 435.\n\n      Allstate contends that the district court used a proscribed mathematical\napproach when it reduced the fee award to reflect the ratio of insurance claims\non which Allstate prevailed. But the Supreme Court did not categorically bar\nthe use of math. The court’s mathematical approach was different in kind from\nthe prohibited penalizing of alternative arguments or substitute remedies.\nAllstate has not identified why the proportionate approach was a poor measure\nof the degree of success, nor has it proposed an alternative means of calibrating\nthe fee award to reflect its limited success. “There is no precise rule or formula\nfor making these determinations,” and “[t]he court necessarily has discretion\nin making this equitable judgment.” Id. at 436–37. The use of the proportion\nbetween the number of disputed claims and the success on those claims was\nnot an abuse of that discretion.\n\n                                       IX.\n      The district court declined to award prejudgment interest, stating that\n                                       16\n\f    Case: 14-10574    Document: 00513196769       Page: 17   Date Filed: 09/17/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10574\nthe decision was within its discretion. It offered no other justification, but it\ndid cite two district-court decisions that had denied prejudgment interest in\nRICO cases. The reasoning in both was that RICO’s treble damages suffici-\nently offset the cost of being temporarily deprived of the recovered funds, mak-\ning prejudgment interest unnecessary to mitigate the cost of that deprivation.\nSee La.

But even where prejudgment interest is indisputably available, “the\ndecision to award such interest rests within the sound discretion of the district\ncourt,” and we “will not overturn the district court’s determination in the\nabsence of an abuse of discretion.” Sellers v.
