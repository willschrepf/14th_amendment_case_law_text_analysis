Finding clear error, in part because of the\n\ncourt’s reliance on the electoral success of a black candidate during the pendency of this\n\nlitigation, we reverse and remand for the implementation of a remedy.\n\n                                 I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       This lawsuit began in 1985 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\n\nFlorida. Appellants sued Liberty County’s Commission, School Board, and commissioners and\n\nmembers in their official capacities (collectively appellees), alleging that at-large elections\n\nunlawfully diluted minority voting strength, in violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973.1 In March 1986, the district court conducted a five-day bench trial and, a year\n\nlater, entered final judgment in favor of appellees. See Solomon v. Liberty County, Fla., Nos.\n\n85-7009-MMP, 85-7010-MMP (N.D. Fla. May 4, 1987) (unpublished).\n\n       On appeal, a panel of this court vacated and remanded for further findings of fact.\n\nSolomon v. Liberty County, Fla., 865 F.2d 1566 (11th Cir. 1988) (Solomon I), vacated, 873 F.2d\n\n248 (11th Cir. 1989). In April 1990, the court reheard the case en banc. Solomon v. Liberty\n\nCounty, Fla., 899 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (Solomon II), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1023\n\n(1991). Unanimously vacating and remanding for further proceedings, the court held that\n\n\n\n       1\n         Appellants’ lawsuit against the School Board encompassed not only section 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act but also the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution. Because of our holding, we need not reach the constitutional claim. Accord\nSolomon v. Liberty County, Fla., 865 F.2d 1566, 1569 n.2 (11th Cir. 1988) (Solomon I)\n(appellants’ “constitutional claims are not before us on appeal”), vacated, 873 F.2d 248 (11th\nCir. 1989).\n\n                                                  2\n\fcontrary to the district court’s judgment, appellants satisfied the three factors set forth in\n\nThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), “as a matter of law[.]” Solomon II, 899 F.2d at 1013\n\n(per curiam).\n\n       The court, however, divided five-five concerning the significance of that holding. See\n\nSolomon II, 899 F.2d at 1013-21 (Kravitch, J., specially concurring), 1021-37 (Tjoflat, C.J.,\n\nspecially concurring). According to five judges, appellants established section 2 violations and\n\ndeserved a remedy. See Solomon II, 899 F.2d at 1021 (Kravitch, J., specially concurring). The\n\nother five judges, however, reaffirmed the prior panel’s opinion that further findings of fact were\n\nwarranted. See Solomon II, 899 F.2d at 1021, 1037 (Tjoflat, C.J., specially concurring). Unable\n\nto create a majority opinion, the en banc court simply instructed the district court “to proceed in\n\naccordance with Gingles, giving due consideration to the views expressed in Chief Judge\n\nTjoflat$s and Judge Kravitch$s specially concurring opinions.” Solomon II, 899 F.2d at 1013\n\n(per curiam).\n\n       On remand, the district court granted appellees’ motion to supplement the record and\n\nconducted a half-day trial. Based on the evidence it admitted in the first and second trials and\n\ntwo judicially noticed facts, the district court again found that Liberty County’s at-large elections\n\ndo not violate section 2 and entered final judgment in favor of appellees. See Solomon v.\n\nLiberty County, Fla., 957 F. Supp. 1522 (N.D. Fla. 1997) (Solomon III).\n\n                                        II. BACKGROUND\n\n       Liberty County is located in northwest Florida. It is especially rural; the Apalachicola\n\nNational Forest encompasses much of its 836 square miles. As Florida’s least densely-populated\n\ncounty, it averages seven persons per square mile. Liberty County’s population totals only\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f5,569.2 Of Liberty County’s 5,569 residents, 982 – or 17.63 percent – are black.3 The county’s\n\ntotal voting age population (that is, persons over the age of 18) is 3,320, of whom 831 – or 25.03\n\npercent – are black.\n\n       Residents vote at one of eight precincts.4 Candidate seat-wise, however, five equally\n\npopulous residential districts divide Liberty County. “To a great extent, the county is . . .\n\nracially segregated.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1558. Approximately 90 percent of its black\n\npopulation lives in “residential district 1,” which corresponds somewhat to voting precincts 1\n\nand 2.5 Of residential district 1’s 640 registered voters in 1991, blacks comprise 295 – or 46.09\n\npercent. Although “significant socio-economic disparities” exist between Liberty County’s\n\nwhite and black residents, substantially all of its voters are Democrats. Solomon III, 957 F.\n\nSupp. at 1559.\n\n       Liberty County’s Commission and School Board each consists of five members who\n\nserve staggered four-year terms. Candidates run for numbered seats that correspond to their\n\nresidential district. Voters elect candidates at-large, that is, the entire county electorate votes for\n\none candidate from each residential district. To become their party’s nominee, candidates must\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          Current figures are based on the 1990 census and other evidence presented at the\nsecond trial. At the time of the first trial, Liberty County’s population was 4,260.\n       3\n         At the time of the first trial, blacks totaled 471 – or 11.06 percent – of Liberty County’s\n4,260 population.\n       4\n         Apparently, at the time of the first trial, seven voting precincts existed. See Solomon v.\nLiberty County, Fla., Nos. 85-7009-MMP, 85-7010-MMP, at 11 (N.D. Fla. May 4, 1987)\n(unpublished).\n       5\n         According to the evidence at the first trial, blacks comprise 58.05 percent of precinct 1\nand 56.92 percent of precinct 2.\n\n                                                   4\n\freceive a majority (that is, greater than 50 percent) of the county-wide vote. If no candidate\n\nreceives a majority in the first primary election, the county conducts a second (or run-off)\n\nprimary election. To win the general election, candidates must obtain a plurality (that is, more\n\nthan their opponents) of the county-wide vote. Because most candidates in Liberty County are\n\nDemocrats, voters usually decide races during the primary elections.\n\n       Prior to the commencement of this case, four black candidates unsuccessfully ran for\n\ncounty-wide office. “Black candidates for seats on the school board included Charles Berrium in\n\n1968, and Earl Jennings in 1980 and 1984. In 1984, Gregory Solomon ran for a seat on the\n\ncounty commission.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1557. Six months after 1990’s en banc\n\nmandate, however, Jennings won the residential district 1 seat on the county commission,\n\ndefeating a white opponent in the primary and a white Republican incumbent in the general\n\nelection. In 1992, voters reelected Jennings in the run-off primary over three white opponents,\n\ntwo of whom failed to make it past the first primary. In 1996, two black candidates and one\n\nwhite candidate challenged Jennings, but he again prevailed in the run-off primary election.\n\nAccording to the record, Jennings is the only black candidate that Liberty County voters have\n\nelected to public office.\n\n                       III. DISTRICT COURT’S FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n       In its memorandum opinion, the district court rendered findings of fact that favored both\n\nappellants and appellees before it ultimately found no vote dilution. As to findings of fact that\n\nfavored appellants, the district court first recognized the unanimous en banc holding that\n\nappellants had proved the three Gingles factors, that is, Liberty County’s (1) black voters are\n\n“sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fdistrict[,]” namely residential district 1; (2) black voters are “politically cohesive”; and (3) the\n\n“white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it” usually to defeat black voters’\n\n“preferred candidate.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51; Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1555.\n\nAdditionally, the court found that “a high degree of racially polarized voting” exists. Solomon\n\nIII, 957 F. Supp. at 1560. Fifth, it stated that “the continued use of the majority vote requirement\n\ncan work to the detriment of black candidates[,]” as can “the size of Liberty County[.]” 957 F.\n\nSupp. at 1560-61. Finally, the court pointed out that “[b]lacks have not achieved proportional\n\nrepresentation on the Liberty County School Board.” 957 F. Supp. at 1570.\n\n       As to findings of fact that favored appellees, the district court first found “no evidence”\n\nthat the historical and “remaining vestiges of official discrimination in Liberty County” hinder\n\n“the ability of blacks to participate in the political process[.] Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1559.\n\nNext, it held that because of Jennings’s 1990 electoral success, “blacks have not been excluded\n\nfrom Liberty County’s informal slating process” that consists of “large white families” with\n\nwhich candidates “must align themselves” “[i]n order . . . to be successful[.]” 957 F. Supp. at\n\n1561-63 & nn. 96-97. Additionally, according to the court, black candidates’ “lack of\n\nknowledge of the dynamics of running effective campaigns[,]” as opposed to “the present socio-\n\neconomic effects of past discrimination[,]” “significant[ly] imped[e] . . . black political\n\nparticipation in Liberty County.” 957 F. Supp. at 1564-65. Fourth, the court found “no record\n\nevidence of any recent overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns in Liberty County.” 957 F.\n\nSupp. at 1565. Further, it stated that “the more recent history of elections in Liberty County\n\nshows consistent electoral success by the black candidate of choice for public office,” Jennings.\n\n957 F. Supp. at 1566. Sixth, the court found that “with few exceptions, the Liberty County\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fSchool Board and County Commission have been responsive to the needs of the black\n\ncommunity.” 957 F. Supp. at 1567. Moreover, “as a matter of law[,]” the court concluded,\n\nappellants “failed to establish that the policy underlying the use of at-large elections in Liberty\n\nCounty is tenuous.” 957 F. Supp. at 1568. Eighth, it stated that “racial animus” does not drive\n\nLiberty County’s electoral process. 957 F. Supp. at 1570. Finally, citing Jennings’s election and\n\nre-elections, the court found that blacks “clearly” enjoy “proportional representation on the\n\ncounty commission.” 957 F. Supp. at 1570.\n\n                                            IV. ISSUE\n\n       The encompassing issue before us is whether the district court erred in finding that\n\nLiberty County’s at-large method of electing its county commissioners and school board\n\nmembers does not violate section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. We\n\nreview the district court’s historical, subsidiary and ultimate findings of fact for clear\n\nerror. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (“[T]he clearly-erroneous test of [Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure] 52(a) is the appropriate standard for appellate review of a finding of no\n\nvote dilution.”). “[A] finding is ‘clearly erroneous’ when although there is evidence to\n\nsupport it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.” Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,\n\nN.C., 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nAdditionally, “we will correct a district court’s errors of law and its findings of fact based\n\nupon misconceptions of law.” Negron v. City of Miami Beach, Fla., 113 F.3d 1563,\n\n1566 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f                                     V. DISCUSSION\n\n       To prevail on a claim of vote dilution under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n\nplaintiffs must establish that, “based on the totality of circumstances,” “the political\n\nprocesses leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivisions are not\n\nequally open to [racial minority] participation . . . in that its members have less\n\nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process\n\nand to elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973. At minimum, section 2\n\nplaintiffs must prove “the three now-familiar Gingles factors\n\n(compactness/numerousness, minority cohesion or bloc voting, and majority bloc\n\nvoting)[.]” Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1011 (1994). However,\n\n       other factors . . . may, in ‘the totality of circumstances,’ support a claim of\n       racial vote dilution. Derived from the Senate Report accompanying the\n       1982 amendment to section 2, those factors include:\n\n              1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in the\n              state or political subdivision that touched the right of the\n              members of the minority group to register, to vote, or\n              otherwise to participate in the democratic process;\n              2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or\n              political subdivision is racially polarized;\n              3. the extent to which the state or political subdivision has\n              used unusually large election districts, majority vote\n              requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting\n              practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for\n              discrimination against the minority group;\n              4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members\n              of the minority group have been denied access to that process;\n              5. the extent to which members of the minority group in the\n              state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination\n              in such areas as education, employment and health, which\n\n\n                                              8\n\f              hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political\n              process;\n              6. whether political campaigns have been characterized by\n              overt or subtle racial appeals; [and]\n              7. the extent to which members of the minority group have\n              been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.\n\n       Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36-37, 106 S. Ct. at 2759 (quoting S. Rep. No. 417, at\n       28-29, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 177, 206-07). Additional factors\n       that may be probative of vote dilution in some cases are:\n\n              [8.] whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on\n              the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the\n              members of the minority group; [and]\n              [9.] whether the policy underlying the state or political\n              subdivision's use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to\n              voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.\n\n       [Gingles, 478 U.S.] at 37, 106 S. Ct. at 2759.\n\nNipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1511 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (plurality opinion of\n\nTjoflat, C.J.), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1083 (1995). Also, in a section 2 case involving\n\nstate legislative single-member districts, the Supreme Court announced another factor,\n\nproportionality, that it defined as the relationship between “the number of majority-\n\nminority voting districts [and] minority members’ share of the relevant population.” De\n\nGrandy, 512 U.S. at 1013-14 & n.11. Finally, two judges of this court consider racial\n\nbias in the voting community to be a relevant factor. Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524 (“The\n\ndefendant may rebut the plaintiff’s evidence by demonstrating the absence of racial bias\n\nin the voting community[.]”) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J., with Anderson, J.).\n\n       In this case, the district court outlined what it believed to be “a reasoned\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fmethodology for examining claims under section 2”:\n\n       In order to prove unlawful vote dilution, in violation of section 2, a plaintiff\n       must meet the following test. First, the plaintiff must demonstrate the three\n       Gingles factors of geographic compactness, political cohesiveness, and\n       racial bloc voting. If one or more of the Gingles factors is not shown, then\n       the defendant prevails. If all three factors are proven, then the court must\n       review all relevant evidence under the totality of the circumstances. The\n       defendant may present evidence of the lack of racial bias in the community,\n       proportionate representation, past and present electoral success, as well as\n       proof of the other factors which are indicative of the existence or non-\n       existence of vote dilution. The plaintiff may respond in kind. Without\n       treating any single factor as dispositive, the reviewing court will finally\n       determine through a searching inquiry whether the members of the minority\n       group are denied equal political opportunity with respect to their race or\n       color. If they are, then a claim under section 2 has been established.\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1553-54. The parties do not dispute the legal accuracy of\n\nthis framework. Rather, they dispute the district court’s application of it as well as the\n\ndilution factors. As we outlined in section III of this opinion, the district court found that\n\nthe three Gingles factors, Senate Factors 2 and 3, and a lack of proportionality (only as to\n\nthe school board) cut in favor of appellants. On the other hand, the court weighed Senate\n\nFactors 1, 4-9, proportionality (only as to the county commission), and the absence of\n\nracial bias in favor of appellees. Appellants argue that the district court clearly erred in\n\nrendering findings adverse to them, including its ultimate determination of no vote\n\ndilution. Appellees defend the district court’s judgment, contending that it properly\n\nresolved conflicts in the evidence and considered the totality of the circumstances.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       We begin with appellants’ principal assignment of error, the district court’s\n\n\n                                              10\n\freliance on the electoral success of Earl Jennings, a black county commissioner. One of\n\nthe two “most important Senate Report factors” is the “extent to which minority group\n\nmembers have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.” Southern Christian\n\nLeadership Conference of Alabama v.

It is undisputed that prior to 1990, no\n\nblack candidate – including Jennings – had been elected to a county-wide office.

See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1561-63 & nn.96-97, 1565,\n\n1570.\n\n        We agree with appellants that the district court clearly erred in rendering the first\n\ntwo findings (Senate Factors 7 and 4), but we hold that the district court did not clearly\n\nerr with the third finding (DeGrandy/proportionality). It is well-recognized that\n\n“[e]lections of minority candidates during the pendency of Section Two litigation . . .\n\nhave little probative value.” Davis v. Chiles, 139 F.3d 1414, 1417 n.2 (11th Cir. 1998)\n\n(assigning “little probative value” to the post-trial appointment and reelection of a black\n\njudge in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit, which includes Liberty County, and the\n\n“recent” election of a black judge who faced a white opponent in Leon County, Florida).\n\nIn crafting this rule, Congress, the Supreme Court and the former Fifth Circuit reasoned\n\nthat “the possibility exists that the majority citizens might evade [§ 2] by manipulating the\n\nelection of a ‘safe’ minority candidate” and that pending litigation “might” work “a one-\n\ntime advantage for black candidates in the form of unusual organized political support by\n\nwhite leaders concerned to forestall single-member districting.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 75-\n\n76 (quoting in part Senate Report at 29, and Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297, 1307\n\n(5th Cir. 1973) (en banc), aff’d sub nom., East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424\n\nU.S. 636 (1976) (per curiam)). Indeed, because it is couched in “possibilities” and\n\n                                              14\n\f“mights,” this rule may very well be unconditional, that is, not requiring proof beyond\n\nthe timing of the election. See also NAACP v. Gadsden County Sch. Bd., 691 F.2d 978,\n\n983 (11th Cir. 1982) (“[P]oliticians might find it politically expedient to have a ‘token’\n\nblack school board member.”) (emphasis added).\n\n       In any event, to be sure, the circumstances surrounding Jennings’s 1990 election\n\nfit squarely within the rule’s rationale. Following two unsuccessful school board\n\nelections, Jennings became Liberty County’s first elected county official after not only\n\nthe filing of this lawsuit, but also the en banc court’s mandate that appellants proved the\n\nthree Gingles factors as a matter of law. Indeed, it occurred in the wake of five circuit\n\njudges concluding that appellants established liability and deserved a remedy. See\n\nSolomon II, 899 F.2d at 1021 (Kravitch, J., specially concurring). Furthermore, as the\n\ndistrict court found, Jennings would not have won the Democratic primary but for the\n\nsupport of “large white families” that ran Liberty County’s informal slating process. See\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1561-62. The “possibility” of vote “manipulation” further\n\nintensifies when we consider the anomalous polarization data associated with Jennings’s\n\npre-litigation races. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 75-76. According to all ten judges of the en\n\nbanc court who reviewed that data, the white majority likely perceived Jennings as a\n\n“safe” minority candidate. See Solomon II, 899 F.2d at 1019-20 nn.8 & 9 (“[T]he white\n\nestablishment in Liberty County backed Earl Jennings’ 1980 school board candidacy.”)\n\n(Kravitch, J., specially concurring); Solomon I, 865 F.2d at 1579-81 & n.26 (“[V]oting\n\npatterns were not polarized in Earl Jennings’s 1980 candidacy. The reason for this lack of\n\n                                             15\n\fpolarization may well be explained by the district court’s observation that Jennings had\n\nrun on a ‘white slate.’”). Jennings’s beating a Republican in a predominately-Democrat\n\ncounty and twice retaining his seat as an incumbent are other “special circumstances” that\n\nlikely belie his electoral success. Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., 985 F.2d\n\n1471, 1483-84 (11th Cir. 1993) (“[T]he presence of special circumstances such as\n\nincumbency or lack of opposition may explain the success of the minorities’ preferred\n\ncandidate in some elections.”) (per curiam) (emphasis added). But cf. Solomon III, 957\n\nF. Supp. at 1556 n.79 (“[A]ny suggestion that racial polarization in the county was\n\nsomehow caused by partisan politics . . . would have no meaning here.”) (distinguishing\n\nLeague of United Latin Am. Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831 (5th\n\nCir. 1993) (en banc), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1071 (1994)) (emphasis added). So is 1992’s\n\nfirst primary, where Jennings faced three white challengers. See Rollins v. Fort Bend\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 89 F.3d 1205, 1212 (5th Cir. 1996) (“The evidence demonstrates that\n\nminority candidates have been elected to the . . . school board without special\n\ncircumstances, such as a candidate running unopposed or opposed by two strong Anglo\n\ncandidates.”) (emphasis added).\n\n       Contrary to the district court’s view, appellees, not appellants, bore the burden of\n\nproving that Jennings’s success had probative value. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at\n\n1566 (“There has been no suggestion nor proof offered by Plaintiffs that white officials or\n\nwhite voters in Liberty County have manipulated the electoral success of Mr. Jennings in\n\norder to defeat Plaintiff’s vote dilution challenge.”) (emphasis added). Although section\n\n                                             16\n\f2 plaintiffs bear the burden of proving the Gingles factors and other factors in the totality\n\nof circumstances that support a finding of vote dilution, defendants bear the burden of\n\nproving any factor that they believe weighs in their favor. See Sanchez v. Colorado, 97\n\nF.3d 1303, 1322 (10th Cir. 1996) (“Plaintiffs are not required to rebut all the evidence of\n\nnon-dilution to establish vote dilution.”), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1820 (1997); Teague v.\n\nAttala County, Miss., 92 F.3d 283, 290 (5th Cir. 1996) (“[T]he district court errs by\n\nplacing the burden on plaintiffs to disprove that factors other than race affect voting\n\npatterns in Attala County.”), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 45 (1997); accord Nipper, 39 F.3d at\n\n1513 (“A defendant in a vote dilution case may always attempt to rebut the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim by introducing evidence of objective, non-racial factors under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances standard.”) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J.). Consistent with this\n\nstandard and the district court’s undisputed legal framework, as proponents of the post-en\n\nbanc evidence (and to rebut the presumption that the election of a minority candidate\n\nduring section 2 litigation carries no more than nominal probative value), appellees bore\n\nthe burden of proving that Jennings was, in fact, the black candidate of choice. Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Marengo County Comm’n, 731 F.2d 1546, 1574-75 (11th Cir.) (“In view\n\nof the evidence already in the record, the defendants bear the burden of establishing that\n\ncircumstances have changed sufficiently to make our finding of discriminatory results in\n\n1978 inapplicable in 1984.”), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 976 (1984). In proffering only the\n\nelection results, however, they failed to meet that burden as a matter of law.\n\nUnquestionably, mere proof of Jennings’s race could not support a finding that he was the\n\n                                             17\n\fchoice of black voters. See Sanchez, 97 F.3d at 1320. Importantly, appellees did not\n\nproffer any statistical analysis at the second trial. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1560\n\nn.89 (appellees did not “bother[] to perform a bivariate ecological regression analysis of\n\n[Jennings’s] elections in 1990, 1992, and 1996”). Nor could appellees rely on pre-en\n\nbanc statistical evidence concerning Jennings to show that he was the black candidate of\n\nchoice. Even the original appellate panel considered that evidence to be of little value.\n\nSee Solomon I, 865 F.2d at 1581 (“Earl Jennings, although black, may not have been\n\nperceived as a black candidate.”).\n\n       The district court’s sua sponte mathematical analysis of the 1990, 1992 and 1996\n\nelections results further evinces clear error. Although neither party argued percentages at\n\ntrial or in their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court became its own\n\nmath advocate. In finding Jennings to be the “overall . . . black candidate of choice[,]”\n\nthe court stated that\n\n       [i]n the 1990 election, Mr. Jennings received 75.52 percent of the votes cast\n       in district 1 in the first primary, and 76.81 percent of the votes cast in\n       district 1 in the general election. . . . In the 1992 election, Mr. Jennings\n       received 55.84 percent of the votes cast in district 1 in the first primary (a\n       figure less conclusive of black support), and 72.04 percent of the votes cast\n       in district 1 in the second primary. . . . In the 1996 election, black support\n       in the first primary was apparently divided between the three black\n       candidates (Mr. Jennings received 24.06 percent of the vote in residential\n       district 1, compared to 52.83 percent for Stafford Stanley Dawson and\n       12.26 percent for Helen Hall), but was squarely behind Mr. Jennings in the\n       second primary when he garnered 73.02 percent of the votes cast in district\n       1.\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1562-63 n.97 (emphasis added). As is readily apparent,\n\n\n                                             18\n\falthough it divided the numbers correctly, the court used data from “voting precinct 1” to\n\nreach conclusions about “residential district 1.”6 This was clear error. “Voting precinct\n\n1” simply refers to one of eight physical polling locations. “Residential district 1,” in\n\ncontrast, represents one of five seats for which county commission and school board\n\ncandidates run, as well as a would-be single-member district where blacks, together with\n\nthe white cross-over vote, are “sufficiently large in number and geographically compact\n\nto constitute a majority[.]” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50; see Solomon I, 865 F.2d at 1574\n\n(“[I]f white crossover votes are included, an effective black majority would be achieved\n\nin the district.”). Plainly, residential district 1’s borders do not equate to those of voting\n\nprecinct 1; according to the district court itself, “residential district 1 . . . includes the first\n\nand second precincts.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1556 (emphasis added). Nor does\n\nresidential district 1 represent the simple combination of voting precincts 1 and 2.\n\nCompare Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1556 (“[B]lacks comprise 46.09 percent of all the\n\nregistered voters in residential district one.”) with 957 F. Supp. at 1562 n.96 (voting\n\n\n\n       6\n          Although no party points out these errors to us, they are patently obvious. According\nto the table that we have reproduced in the text of the opinion, in the 1990 primary, Jennings\nreceived 75.52 percent (108 / (108 + 35)) of the votes in precinct 1 – a figure that the district\ncourt erroneously attributed to “district 1.” Likewise, (1) in the 1990 general election, Jennings\nreceived 76.81 percent (106 / (106 + 32)) of the votes in precinct 1, not “district 1”; (2) in the\n1992 first primary election, Jennings received 55.84 percent (110 / (110 + 11 + 30 + 46)) of the\nvotes in precinct 1, not “district 1”; (3) in the 1992 run-off primary election, Jennings received\n72.04 percent (134 / (134 + 52)) of the votes in precinct 1, not “district 1”; (4) in the 1996 first\nprimary election, Jennings received 24.06 percent (51 / (51 + 23 + 112 + 26)) of the votes in\nprecinct 1, not “residential district 1”; and (5) in the 1996 run-off primary election, Jennings\nreceived 73.02 percent (138 / (138 + 51)) of the votes in precinct 1, not “district 1.” Solomon\nIII, 957 F. Supp. at 1562-63 n.97.\n\n                                                 19\n\fprecinct 1 is 58.05 percent black, and voting precinct 2 is 56.92 percent black).\n\n       Our finding clear error in the district court’s reliance on Jennings’s electoral\n\nsuccess, although “inherently fact-intensive,” comports with precedent. Nipper, 39 F.3d\n\nat 1498 (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J.). In NAACP v. Campbell, this court held that\n\nthe district court attached “inordinate significance” to a single black candidate’s\n\nsuccessful, at-large election to the school board that occurred after plaintiffs filed the\n\nlawsuit. 691 F.2d at 983 (“The election of a single black . . . is not conclusive evidence\n\nthat the votes of the minority are not being diluted.”). Similarly, in United States v.\n\nMarengo County Comm’n, this court discounted the probative value of a black\n\ncandidate’s election and reelection to county coroner in an at-large system. See 731 F.2d\n\nat 1572 (“The district court’s conclusion that this nearly complete lack of success did not\n\nindicate a lack of effective access to the system . . . is clearly erroneous.”). And, the court\n\nin McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla. did not even consider – and thus relegated to a\n\nfootnote – the at-large election of one black county commissioner during the pendency of\n\nlitigation. See 748 F.2d 1037, 1045 n.20 (11th Cir. 1984). See also generally White v.\n\nRegester, 412 U.S. 755, 766-67 (1973) (finding significance in the fact that the “white-\n\ndominated organization that is in effective control of Democratic Party candidate slating”\n\nhad endorsed only two black candidates) (cited in Margeno, 731 F.2d at 1569); City of\n\nCarrollton Branch of the NAACP v. Stallings, 829 F.2d 1547, 1560 (11th Cir. 1987)\n\n(finding “no sustained minority electoral success” within the county government despite\n\none minority candidate’s election to a municipal position after the filing of the lawsuit),\n\n                                              20\n\fcert. denied, 485 U.S. 936 (1988). Unlike the district court, these appellate panels did not\n\nrequire plaintiffs to advance proof of voter manipulation. See Campbell, 691 F.2d at 983;\n\nMarengo, 731 F.2d at 1572; McMillan, 748 F.2d at 1045 & n.20; accord Davis, 139 F.3d\n\nat 1417 n.2.7 Although we find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that\n\nblacks had achieved proportional representation (only as to the county commission)\n\npursuant to DeGrandy, we accord this factor less weight because of the timing of\n\nJennings’s election. See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1020 (“[T]he degree of probative value\n\nassigned to proportionality may vary with the facts.”)\n\n                                                  B.\n\n       We turn next to appellants’ contention that the district court erred in finding that\n\nblack candidates’ “lack of knowledge of the dynamics of running effective campaigns[,]”\n\nas opposed to “the present socio-economic effects of past discrimination[,]”\n\n“significant[ly] imped[e] . . . black political participation in Liberty County.” Solomon\n\nIII, 957 F. Supp. at 1564-65 (Senate Factor 5). Appellants argue that the court assumed\n\n\n       7\n            At first blush, this case may appear to contradict Askew v. City of Rome, where this\ncourt adopted the district court’s judgment that no vote dilution resulted from Rome’s at-large\nmethod of electing its commissioners and board of education members, in part because plaintiffs\n“produced no evidence” that the white electorate engaged in “some sort of active conspiracy . . .\nto allow the black community a token representative, but no more.” 127 F.3d 1355, 1385 (11th\nCir. 1997) (per curiam). A close read of Askew, however, reveals that it is materially\ndistinguishable from this case. First, unlike the voters in Liberty County, the voters in Rome\nelected the black candidate prior to litigation. Next, in contrast to appellants, the Askew\nplaintiffs failed to establish one of the Gingles factors, racial polarization. Finally, the plaintiffs\nin Askew bore the burden of discounting minority success because they were attempting to prove\nan “essential element” of their section 2 claim, whereas appellees in this case bore the burden of\nproving those Senate factors (e.g., Senate Factor 7, minority electoral success) that they believed\nweighed in their favor. 127 F.3d at 1385.\n\n                                                  21\n\fwithout foundation that black candidates and would-be candidates are more “apathetic”\n\nthan their white counterparts. In response, appellees contend that the record supports the\n\ndistrict court’s finding.\n\n       We do not find that the district court clearly erred in rendering its finding on\n\nSenate Factor 5. In this circuit, it is well-established that “when there is clear evidence of\n\npresent socioeconomic or political disadvantage resulting from past discrimination, . . .\n\nthe burden is not on the plaintiffs to prove that this disadvantage is causing reduced\n\npolitical participation, but rather is on those who deny the causal nexus to show that the\n\ncause is something else.” Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1569 (collecting cases). Thus, Senate\n\nFactor 5 should have weighed in appellants’ favor unless appellees offered a\n\npreponderance of evidence that something other than the lingering effects of past\n\ndiscrimination caused the low number of black candidates.\n\n       Appellees point to four portions of the record that they contend support the district\n\ncourt’s finding: (1) testimony that “blacks have frequently not known nor asked about\n\nalternatives to paying qualifying fees”; (2) Solomon’s testimony that he “did not know a\n\nvoter registration list was available to assist in targeting people who are more likely to\n\nvote”; (3) Solomon’s testimony that “getting to know the public is also a big part of” a\n\nsuccessful campaign; and (4) testimony from Dr. Billings, appellee’s expert witness, that\n\n“Jennings’s electoral success in 1990 resulted in large part from becoming more\n\nknowledgeable about the political process in Liberty County, and running a very personal\n\nkind of campaign.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1564-65 n.101 (internal quotation marks\n\n                                             22\n\fand record citations omitted). In addition, the district court provided additional examples\n\nsupporting its finding that socio-economic disparities did not hinder black political\n\nparticipation in Liberty County. We believe that appellee’s contentions, along with other\n\nsubsidiary findings that the district court made, support the conclusion that the district\n\ncourt’s finding that “the greatest obstacle to effective black participation in the political\n\nprocess has been a lack of knowledge of the dynamics of running effective campaigns”\n\nwas not clearly erroneous. Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1564.\n\n                                                C.\n\n       Finally, we discuss appellants’ assertion that the district court clearly erred in its\n\noverall finding of no vote dilution. Our review of this issue, of course, must take into\n\naccount the error that we have already found. In section V, part A, we found clear error\n\nin the district court’s reliance on Jennings’s post-en banc electoral success. This error\n\ntainted the court’s weighing Senate Factors 4 and 7 (but not proportionality as to the\n\ncounty commission) in favor of appellees.8\n\n       That leaves us with the three Gingles factors, Senate Factors 2 and 3, and lack of\n\nproportionality (only as to the school board) weighing in favor of appellants,\n\nproportionality (only as to the county commission, and accorded less weight because of\n\n       8\n          Because the district court’s finding of proportionality regarding Jennings’s election to\nthe county commission is accorded less weight, and because the lack of proportionality on the\nschool board is not dispositive to our reversal, we assume without deciding that De Grandy’s\nproportionality factor properly applies where, as here, an at-large election system – as opposed to\na single-member voting district – is challenged. See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1014 n.11 (defining\n“proportionality” as the relationship between “the number of majority-minority [single-member]\nvoting districts [and] minority members’ share of the relevant population[]”).\n\n                                                23\n\fthe timing of Jennings’s election) and Senate Factor 5 weighing in favor of appellees, and\n\nSenate Factors 1, 6, 8 and 9 and the absence of racial bias also weighing in favor of\n\nappellees. A review of this record leaves us with “a definite and firm conviction that a\n\nmistake has been committed.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573. First and foremost,\n\nappellants’ unquestionable establishment of the three Gingles factors, that is,\n\ncompactness/numerousness, minority cohesion and majority bloc voting, cuts very\n\nstrongly in their favor. As the Third, Fifth and Tenth Circuits have observed, “it will be\n\nonly the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish the existence of the three\n\nGingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation of § 2 under the totality of\n\ncircumstances.” Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 4 F.3d 1103, 1135\n\n(3d Cir.), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1252 (1994); see also Clark v. Calhoun County, Miss.,\n\n21 F.3d 92, 97 (5th Cir. 1994); Sanchez, 97 F.3d 1303, 1322 (10th Cir. 1996) (“[I]t is the\n\nrare case for minority plaintiffs to satisfy the Gingles’ preconditions and fail to overcome\n\ndefendants’ evidence that other factors rebut that initial proof[.]”). Although this case\n\nmay be “hard[,]” we do not find it particularly “unusual” or “rare.” Solomon III, 957 F.\n\nSupp. at 1525; Jenkins, 4 F.3d at 1135; Sanchez, 97 F.3d at 1322. All ten judges of the\n\nen banc court agreed that appellants proved the Gingles factors “as a matter of law,” and\n\nat least five of those judges found that appellants “adduced strong evidence establishing\n\nthe other supportive [that is, Senate] factors.” Solomon II, 899 F.2d at 1013 (per curiam),\n\n& 1016-17 n.3 (Kravitch, J., specially concurring) (emphasis added). Although eight\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fyears have elapsed between the en banc session and this appeal, the only new analytical\n\nevidence that appellees presented – Jennings’s electoral success and the results of a 1990\n\nreferendum where approximately 59.1 percent of Liberty County’s black voters\n\nsupported the retention of at-large elections for the county commission, and\n\napproximately 60 percent supported at-large elections for the school board – have not\n\nchanged the record in their favor. See Solomon I, 865 F.2d at 1584 (“[C]lass opposition\n\nto the remedy that may result from the successful litigation of a section 2 claim is\n\nirrelevant in weighing the totality of circumstances.”); Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1555\n\nn.75 (even if the district court considered appellees’ new evidence concerning the\n\nthreshold factors, it “would still hold that the three Gingles factors have been established\n\nas a matter of law”); 1987 Memorandum Opinion at 24 (“[T]he propriety of Liberty\n\nCounty’s election system does not depend on whether, why, or what proportion of blacks\n\nfavor a change[.]”).\n\n       Greatly underscoring the strength of appellants’ evidence is Liberty County’s high\n\ndegree of racially polarized voting (Senate Factor 2), a factor that courts consider the\n\nkeystone of a section 2 claim. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 55; McMillan, 748 F.2d at 1043;\n\nMarengo, 731 F.2d at 1566; cf. Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1511-12 (“racially polarized voting[]\n\nis the linchpin of a § 2 vote dilution claim”) (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J.). Indeed, it serves as one of the two “most\n\nimportant Senate Report factors[.]” Sessions, 56 F.3d at 1301 (quoting Gingles, 478 U.S.\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fat 48 n.15, and Senate Report at 28-29) (Hatchett, J., dissenting). Moreover, as the\n\ndistrict court found, “the continued use of the majority vote requirement can work to the\n\ndetriment of black candidates[,]” as can “the size of Liberty County[.]” 957 F. Supp. at\n\n1560-61 (Senate Factor 3); see generally Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1510 (“Of particular concern\n\nare electoral structures, such as at-large elections in areas with white majorities, that\n\nproduce racial vote dilution because ‘[t]he right to vote can be affected by a dilution of\n\nvoting power as well as by an absolute prohibition on casting a ballot.’”) (quoting Allen\n\nv. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 569 (1969)) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J.).\n\nIn its original memorandum opinion, the district court pointedly explained the\n\nsignificance of Liberty County’s size: “Liberty County does present a vast area to cover\n\nin an at-large campaign, and this factor could work to the detriment of black candidates\n\nbecause of their lower average income.” 1987 Memorandum Opinion at 13; cf.\n\nMcMillan, 748 F.2d at 1044 & n.17 (county’s size of 657 square miles “enhance[d] the\n\nproblems faced by blacks seeking access to the political process”); Marengo, 731 F.2d at\n\n1570 (county’s “small population” and “large, rural area” rendered it expensive to\n\ncampaign “county-wide . . . for an at-large position”). The disturbing fact that Liberty\n\nCounty’s blacks earn, on average, less than a third of the amount that whites earn\n\nintensifies this effect. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1563 (“While the average per\n\ncapita income for whites in the county is $ 13,127, the average per capita income for\n\nblacks is only $ 3,935.”); cf. Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1570 (“Since blacks earn, on average,\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fless than half of the amount that whites earn, the district court correctly found that the\n\nsize of the county contributes to dilution.”) (emphasis added).9 Finally, to date, “[b]lacks\n\nhave not achieved proportional representation on the Liberty County School Board.”\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp at 1570 (De Grandy factor).\n\n       In contrast to the evidence favoring appellants, the evidence relative to the\n\nremaining Senate and other factors that purportedly cut in appellees’ favor – Senate\n\nFactors 1, 6, and 8 and the absence of racial bias – was anything but strong, and the\n\ndistrict court’s findings regarding Senate Factor 9 were clearly erroneous. Regarding\n\nSenate Factor 1, that appellants presented “no evidence” that Liberty County’s\n\nundisputed and extensive history of official discrimination hinders blacks’ ability to\n\nparticipate in the democratic process is, at most, a wash. Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at\n\n1559. As we explained in section V, part A of this opinion, appellees, not appellants,\n\nbore the burden of proving any Senate factor that they believed weighed in their favor.\n\nThus, appellants’ failure to produce sufficient evidence on this factor should not hurt their\n\nclaim. Equally as weak is the lack of “recent overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns\n\nin Liberty County.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1566 (Senate Factor 6); see Marengo,\n\n731 F.2d at 1571 (lack of evidence of racial appeals “should not weigh heavily against a\n\nplaintiff proceeding under the results test of section 2” because “overtly bigoted behavior\n\nhas become more unfashionable”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n       9\n          See also 1987 Memorandum Opinion at 15 (“[B]lacks in Liberty County currently bear\nthe effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health.”).\n\n                                             27\n\f       Nor is the district court’s finding of responsiveness (Senate Factor 8) significant.\n\nAs the court itself acknowledged, this factor is “less important than other factors” in the\n\ntotality of circumstances. Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1566 (citing Senate Report at 29;\n\nand Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1572); see also Gadsden, 691 F.2d at 983 (“Responsiveness . .\n\n. . has nothing to do with impact.”). Strangely, the court’s finding contradicts its original\n\nview of the evidence. Soon after the first trial, the court found that appellants had\n\n“proved a significant lack of responsiveness to the interests of blacks by Liberty County’s\n\nelected officials.” 1987 Memorandum Opinion at 19 (emphasis added). Yet, after\n\nremand, without any new relevant evidence, the court found just the opposite, that is, that\n\nboth the county commission and the school board respond to the needs of the black\n\ncommunity. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1567. These findings are irreconcilable.\n\nAt best, then, responsiveness is a close call.\n\n       With regard to Senate Factor 9, however, we find substantial evidence of clear\n\nerror in the district court’s finding that the policy underlying at-large election of school\n\nboard members, adopted in 1953, was not tenuous but instead was the result of a\n\n“citizen’s reform movement in the county to abolish the existing ward-type political\n\nsystem.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1568. The district court acknowledged that\n\n“[t]here is little question that the Florida legislature’s 1947 legislation allowing counties\n\nto adopt at-large districts for the election of school boards . . . was designed to dilute the\n\nvoting power of the black community.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1567. The district\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fcourt characterized this statute as “allowing” the adoption of at-large elections for school\n\nboards; however, the Florida Legislature chose mandatory language in constructing this\n\nstatute and this court has characterized the statute as a “requirement.” See, e.g., Solomon\n\nI, 865 F.2d at 1578 (Tjoflat, C.J., concurring); McMillan, 638 F.2d at 1245-49.\n\n       The district court also relied upon the testimony of Dr. Billings to support its\n\nconclusion on Senate Factor 9. On cross-examination, however, Dr. Billings stated\n\nspecifically that he was testifying about the use of at-large elections in Liberty County\n\nonly with respect to the county commission – not the school board. The district court\n\nfurther relied upon the results of a 1990 county referendum in which voters chose not to\n\nabolish at-large elections for the school board, with a resulting vote of 72.57% to\n\n27.43%. Statistical analysis of this result showed that black as well as white voters\n\npreferred to retain the at-large system, a fact that the district court ruled “undercut any\n\nsuggestion that the continued policy of maintaining at-large elections . . . is somehow\n\ndiscriminatory or otherwise tenuous.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1568. Whether the\n\nprotected class supports the challenged system, however, is irrelevant in determining\n\nwhether the system is based upon a discriminatory policy. See Solomon I, 865 F.2d at\n\n1584 (“[C]lass opposition to the remedy that may result from the successful litigation of a\n\nsection 2 claim is irrelevant in weighing the totality of circumstances.”). Thus, we\n\nconclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that Senate Factor 9 did not\n\nsupport appellants’ position in this case.\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\f       With regard to racial animus, even if we assume, without deciding, that the district\n\ncourt’s findings are sound, they certainly do not tip the scales in appellees’ favor. In fact,\n\nthe district court essentially neutralized that finding: “the lack of racial animus [in the\n\nvoting community] does not cancel out the proof provided under the other factors.”\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1570. Moreover, under the approach that only two judges\n\nof this court who advocate the relevance of this factor advance, appellees bore the burden\n\nof proof. See Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1515 (“[I]f the evidence [that defendant sponsors]\n\nshows, under a totality of the circumstances, that the community is not motivated by\n\nracial bias in its voting patterns, then a case of vote dilution has not been made.”)\n\n(plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J., and Anderson, J.). But see Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1547-60\n\n(neither the presence nor absence of racial bias in the voting community is relevant to\n\nsection 2's results test) (Hatchett, J., dissenting). It is safe to say that appellees barely\n\nexceeded, if not failed to meet altogether, that burden through cross-examination of\n\nSolomon, appellants’ witness. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1569 (citing Solomon’s\n\ntestimony at 59, 61, 66 and 82-84).\n\n       In short, the neutral findings and evidence favoring appellees did not begin to\n\noutweigh appellants’ strong proof of the three Gingles factors and other vote dilution\n\nfactors. The district court clearly erred in finding to the contrary. We are mindful that no\n\nmechanistic formula exists under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. See De Grandy,\n\n512 U.S. at 1011 (courts should decide section 2 claims based on a “comprehensive, not\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\flimited, canvassing of relevant facts”); Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1574 (“No formula for\n\naggregating the factors applies in every case.”). Our careful, searching and practical\n\nreview of the record, however, compels us to hold that both the Liberty County\n\nCommission and the Liberty County School Board violated section 2 through their at-\n\nlarge election system. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79-80 (courts should “carefully” consider\n\nthe totality of circumstances “based upon a searching practical evaluation of the past and\n\npresent reality”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                                 VI. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and\n\nremand the case for the implementation of a remedy and other proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                            REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n       Liberty County is located in northwest Florida. It is especially rural; the Apalachicola\n\nNational Forest encompasses much of its 836 square miles. As Florida’s least densely-populated\n\ncounty, it averages seven persons per square mile. Liberty County’s population totals only\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f5,569.2 Of Liberty County’s 5,569 residents, 982 – or 17.63 percent – are black.3 The county’s\n\ntotal voting age population (that is, persons over the age of 18) is 3,320, of whom 831 – or 25.03\n\npercent – are black.\n\n       Residents vote at one of eight precincts.4 Candidate seat-wise, however, five equally\n\npopulous residential districts divide Liberty County. “To a great extent, the county is . . .\n\nracially segregated.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1558. Approximately 90 percent of its black\n\npopulation lives in “residential district 1,” which corresponds somewhat to voting precincts 1\n\nand 2.5 Of residential district 1’s 640 registered voters in 1991, blacks comprise 295 – or 46.09\n\npercent. Although “significant socio-economic disparities” exist between Liberty County’s\n\nwhite and black residents, substantially all of its voters are Democrats. Solomon III, 957 F.\n\nSupp. at 1559.\n\n       Liberty County’s Commission and School Board each consists of five members who\n\nserve staggered four-year terms. Candidates run for numbered seats that correspond to their\n\nresidential district. Voters elect candidates at-large, that is, the entire county electorate votes for\n\none candidate from each residential district. To become their party’s nominee, candidates must\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          Current figures are based on the 1990 census and other evidence presented at the\nsecond trial. At the time of the first trial, Liberty County’s population was 4,260.\n       3\n         At the time of the first trial, blacks totaled 471 – or 11.06 percent – of Liberty County’s\n4,260 population.\n       4\n         Apparently, at the time of the first trial, seven voting precincts existed. See Solomon v.\nLiberty County, Fla., Nos. 85-7009-MMP, 85-7010-MMP, at 11 (N.D. Fla. May 4, 1987)\n(unpublished).\n       5\n         According to the evidence at the first trial, blacks comprise 58.05 percent of precinct 1\nand 56.92 percent of precinct 2.\n\n                                                   4\n\freceive a majority (that is, greater than 50 percent) of the county-wide vote. If no candidate\n\nreceives a majority in the first primary election, the county conducts a second (or run-off)\n\nprimary election. To win the general election, candidates must obtain a plurality (that is, more\n\nthan their opponents) of the county-wide vote. Because most candidates in Liberty County are\n\nDemocrats, voters usually decide races during the primary elections.\n\n       Prior to the commencement of this case, four black candidates unsuccessfully ran for\n\ncounty-wide office. “Black candidates for seats on the school board included Charles Berrium in\n\n1968, and Earl Jennings in 1980 and 1984. In 1984, Gregory Solomon ran for a seat on the\n\ncounty commission.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1557. Six months after 1990’s en banc\n\nmandate, however, Jennings won the residential district 1 seat on the county commission,\n\ndefeating a white opponent in the primary and a white Republican incumbent in the general\n\nelection. In 1992, voters reelected Jennings in the run-off primary over three white opponents,\n\ntwo of whom failed to make it past the first primary. In 1996, two black candidates and one\n\nwhite candidate challenged Jennings, but he again prevailed in the run-off primary election.\n\nAccording to the record, Jennings is the only black candidate that Liberty County voters have\n\nelected to public office.\n\n                       III. DISTRICT COURT’S FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n       In its memorandum opinion, the district court rendered findings of fact that favored both\n\nappellants and appellees before it ultimately found no vote dilution. As to findings of fact that\n\nfavored appellants, the district court first recognized the unanimous en banc holding that\n\nappellants had proved the three Gingles factors, that is, Liberty County’s (1) black voters are\n\n“sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fdistrict[,]” namely residential district 1; (2) black voters are “politically cohesive”; and (3) the\n\n“white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it” usually to defeat black voters’\n\n“preferred candidate.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51; Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1555.\n\nAdditionally, the court found that “a high degree of racially polarized voting” exists. Solomon\n\nIII, 957 F. Supp. at 1560. Fifth, it stated that “the continued use of the majority vote requirement\n\ncan work to the detriment of black candidates[,]” as can “the size of Liberty County[.]” 957 F.\n\nSupp. at 1560-61. Finally, the court pointed out that “[b]lacks have not achieved proportional\n\nrepresentation on the Liberty County School Board.” 957 F. Supp. at 1570.\n\n       As to findings of fact that favored appellees, the district court first found “no evidence”\n\nthat the historical and “remaining vestiges of official discrimination in Liberty County” hinder\n\n“the ability of blacks to participate in the political process[.] Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1559.\n\nNext, it held that because of Jennings’s 1990 electoral success, “blacks have not been excluded\n\nfrom Liberty County’s informal slating process” that consists of “large white families” with\n\nwhich candidates “must align themselves” “[i]n order . . . to be successful[.]” 957 F. Supp. at\n\n1561-63 & nn. 96-97. Additionally, according to the court, black candidates’ “lack of\n\nknowledge of the dynamics of running effective campaigns[,]” as opposed to “the present socio-\n\neconomic effects of past discrimination[,]” “significant[ly] imped[e] . . . black political\n\nparticipation in Liberty County.” 957 F. Supp. at 1564-65. Fourth, the court found “no record\n\nevidence of any recent overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns in Liberty County.” 957 F.\n\nSupp. at 1565. Further, it stated that “the more recent history of elections in Liberty County\n\nshows consistent electoral success by the black candidate of choice for public office,” Jennings.\n\n957 F. Supp. at 1566. Sixth, the court found that “with few exceptions, the Liberty County\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fSchool Board and County Commission have been responsive to the needs of the black\n\ncommunity.” 957 F. Supp. at 1567. Moreover, “as a matter of law[,]” the court concluded,\n\nappellants “failed to establish that the policy underlying the use of at-large elections in Liberty\n\nCounty is tenuous.” 957 F. Supp. at 1568. Eighth, it stated that “racial animus” does not drive\n\nLiberty County’s electoral process. 957 F. Supp. at 1570. Finally, citing Jennings’s election and\n\nre-elections, the court found that blacks “clearly” enjoy “proportional representation on the\n\ncounty commission.” 957 F. Supp. at 1570.\n\n                                            IV. ISSUE\n\n       The encompassing issue before us is whether the district court erred in finding that\n\nLiberty County’s at-large method of electing its county commissioners and school board\n\nmembers does not violate section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. We\n\nreview the district court’s historical, subsidiary and ultimate findings of fact for clear\n\nerror. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79 (“[T]he clearly-erroneous test of [Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure] 52(a) is the appropriate standard for appellate review of a finding of no\n\nvote dilution.”). “[A] finding is ‘clearly erroneous’ when although there is evidence to\n\nsupport it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.” Anderson v.

DISCUSSION\n\n       To prevail on a claim of vote dilution under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n\nplaintiffs must establish that, “based on the totality of circumstances,” “the political\n\nprocesses leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivisions are not\n\nequally open to [racial minority] participation . . . in that its members have less\n\nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process\n\nand to elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973. At minimum, section 2\n\nplaintiffs must prove “the three now-familiar Gingles factors\n\n(compactness/numerousness, minority cohesion or bloc voting, and majority bloc\n\nvoting)[.]” Johnson v. De Grandy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117876\"><a href=\"/opinion/117876/johnson-v-de-grandy/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1011 (1994). However,\n\n       other factors . . . may, in ‘the totality of circumstances,’ support a claim of\n       racial vote dilution. Derived from the Senate Report accompanying the\n       1982 amendment to section 2, those factors include:\n\n              1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in the\n              state or political subdivision that touched the right of the\n              members of the minority group to register, to vote, or\n              otherwise to participate in the democratic process;\n              2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or\n              political subdivision is racially polarized;\n              3. the extent to which the state or political subdivision has\n              used unusually large election districts, majority vote\n              requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting\n              practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for\n              discrimination against the minority group;\n              4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members\n              of the minority group have been denied access to that process;\n              5. the extent to which members of the minority group in the\n              state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination\n              in such areas as education, employment and health, which\n\n\n                                              8\n\f              hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political\n              process;\n              6. whether political campaigns have been characterized by\n              overt or subtle racial appeals; [and]\n              7. the extent to which members of the minority group have\n              been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.\n\n       Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36-37, 106 S. Ct. at 2759 (quoting S. Rep. No. 417, at\n       28-29, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 177, 206-07). Additional factors\n       that may be probative of vote dilution in some cases are:\n\n              [8.] whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on\n              the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the\n              members of the minority group; [and]\n              [9.] whether the policy underlying the state or political\n              subdivision's use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to\n              voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.\n\n       [Gingles, 478 U.S.] at 37, 106 S. Ct. at 2759.\n\nNipper v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682443\"><a href=\"/opinion/682443/jesse-l-nipper-donald-a-carter-annie-ruth-williams-selendra-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1511 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (plurality opinion of\n\nTjoflat, C.J.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). Also, in a section 2 case involving\n\nstate legislative single-member districts, the Supreme Court announced another factor,\n\nproportionality, that it defined as the relationship between “the number of majority-\n\nminority voting districts [and] minority members’ share of the relevant population.” De\n\nGrandy, 512 U.S. at 1013-14 & n.11. Finally, two judges of this court consider racial\n\nbias in the voting community to be a relevant factor. Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524 (“The\n\ndefendant may rebut the plaintiff’s evidence by demonstrating the absence of racial bias\n\nin the voting community[.]”) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J., with Anderson, J.).\n\n       In this case, the district court outlined what it believed to be “a reasoned\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fmethodology for examining claims under section 2”:\n\n       In order to prove unlawful vote dilution, in violation of section 2, a plaintiff\n       must meet the following test. First, the plaintiff must demonstrate the three\n       Gingles factors of geographic compactness, political cohesiveness, and\n       racial bloc voting. If one or more of the Gingles factors is not shown, then\n       the defendant prevails. If all three factors are proven, then the court must\n       review all relevant evidence under the totality of the circumstances. The\n       defendant may present evidence of the lack of racial bias in the community,\n       proportionate representation, past and present electoral success, as well as\n       proof of the other factors which are indicative of the existence or non-\n       existence of vote dilution. The plaintiff may respond in kind. Without\n       treating any single factor as dispositive, the reviewing court will finally\n       determine through a searching inquiry whether the members of the minority\n       group are denied equal political opportunity with respect to their race or\n       color. If they are, then a claim under section 2 has been established.\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1553-54. The parties do not dispute the legal accuracy of\n\nthis framework. Rather, they dispute the district court’s application of it as well as the\n\ndilution factors. As we outlined in section III of this opinion, the district court found that\n\nthe three Gingles factors, Senate Factors 2 and 3, and a lack of proportionality (only as to\n\nthe school board) cut in favor of appellants. On the other hand, the court weighed Senate\n\nFactors 1, 4-9, proportionality (only as to the county commission), and the absence of\n\nracial bias in favor of appellees. Appellants argue that the district court clearly erred in\n\nrendering findings adverse to them, including its ultimate determination of no vote\n\ndilution. Appellees defend the district court’s judgment, contending that it properly\n\nresolved conflicts in the evidence and considered the totality of the circumstances.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       We begin with appellants’ principal assignment of error, the district court’s\n\n\n                                              10\n\freliance on the electoral success of Earl Jennings, a black county commissioner.

Following two unsuccessful school board\n\nelections, Jennings became Liberty County’s first elected county official after not only\n\nthe filing of this lawsuit, but also the en banc court’s mandate that appellants proved the\n\nthree Gingles factors as a matter of law. Indeed, it occurred in the wake of five circuit\n\njudges concluding that appellants established liability and deserved a remedy. See\n\nSolomon II, 899 F.2d at 1021 (Kravitch, J., specially concurring). Furthermore, as the\n\ndistrict court found, Jennings would not have won the Democratic primary but for the\n\nsupport of “large white families” that ran Liberty County’s informal slating process. See\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1561-62. The “possibility” of vote “manipulation” further\n\nintensifies when we consider the anomalous polarization data associated with Jennings’s\n\npre-litigation races. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 75-76. According to all ten judges of the en\n\nbanc court who reviewed that data, the white majority likely perceived Jennings as a\n\n“safe” minority candidate.

In proffering only the\n\nelection results, however, they failed to meet that burden as a matter of law.\n\nUnquestionably, mere proof of Jennings’s race could not support a finding that he was the\n\n                                             17\n\fchoice of black voters. See Sanchez, 97 F.3d at 1320. Importantly, appellees did not\n\nproffer any statistical analysis at the second trial. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1560\n\nn.89 (appellees did not “bother[] to perform a bivariate ecological regression analysis of\n\n[Jennings’s] elections in 1990, 1992, and 1996”). Nor could appellees rely on pre-en\n\nbanc statistical evidence concerning Jennings to show that he was the black candidate of\n\nchoice. Even the original appellate panel considered that evidence to be of little value.\n\nSee Solomon I, 865 F.2d at 1581 (“Earl Jennings, although black, may not have been\n\nperceived as a black candidate.”).\n\n       The district court’s sua sponte mathematical analysis of the 1990, 1992 and 1996\n\nelections results further evinces clear error. Although neither party argued percentages at\n\ntrial or in their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court became its own\n\nmath advocate. In finding Jennings to be the “overall . . . black candidate of choice[,]”\n\nthe court stated that\n\n       [i]n the 1990 election, Mr. Jennings received 75.52 percent of the votes cast\n       in district 1 in the first primary, and 76.81 percent of the votes cast in\n       district 1 in the general election. . . . In the 1992 election, Mr. Jennings\n       received 55.84 percent of the votes cast in district 1 in the first primary (a\n       figure less conclusive of black support), and 72.04 percent of the votes cast\n       in district 1 in the second primary. . . . In the 1996 election, black support\n       in the first primary was apparently divided between the three black\n       candidates (Mr. Jennings received 24.06 percent of the vote in residential\n       district 1, compared to 52.83 percent for Stafford Stanley Dawson and\n       12.26 percent for Helen Hall), but was squarely behind Mr. Jennings in the\n       second primary when he garnered 73.02 percent of the votes cast in district\n       1.\n\nSolomon III, 957 F.

As is readily apparent,\n\n\n                                             18\n\falthough it divided the numbers correctly, the court used data from “voting precinct 1” to\n\nreach conclusions about “residential district 1.”6 This was clear error. “Voting precinct\n\n1” simply refers to one of eight physical polling locations. “Residential district 1,” in\n\ncontrast, represents one of five seats for which county commission and school board\n\ncandidates run, as well as a would-be single-member district where blacks, together with\n\nthe white cross-over vote, are “sufficiently large in number and geographically compact\n\nto constitute a majority[.]” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50; see Solomon I, 865 F.2d at 1574\n\n(“[I]f white crossover votes are included, an effective black majority would be achieved\n\nin the district.”). Plainly, residential district 1’s borders do not equate to those of voting\n\nprecinct 1; according to the district court itself, “residential district 1 . . . includes the first\n\nand second precincts.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1556 (emphasis added). Nor does\n\nresidential district 1 represent the simple combination of voting precincts 1 and 2.\n\nCompare Solomon III, 957 F.

Similarly, in United States v.\n\nMarengo County Comm’n, this court discounted the probative value of a black\n\ncandidate’s election and reelection to county coroner in an at-large system. See 731 F.2d\n\nat 1572 (“The district court’s conclusion that this nearly complete lack of success did not\n\nindicate a lack of effective access to the system . . . is clearly erroneous.”). And, the court\n\nin McMillan v.

City of Rome, where this\ncourt adopted the district court’s judgment that no vote dilution resulted from Rome’s at-large\nmethod of electing its commissioners and board of education members, in part because plaintiffs\n“produced no evidence” that the white electorate engaged in “some sort of active conspiracy . . .\nto allow the black community a token representative, but no more.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72354\"><a href=\"/opinion/72354/askew-v-city-of-rome-ga-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1385 (11th\nCir. 1997) (per curiam). A close read of Askew, however, reveals that it is materially\ndistinguishable from this case. First, unlike the voters in Liberty County, the voters in Rome\nelected the black candidate prior to litigation. Next, in contrast to appellants, the Askew\nplaintiffs failed to establish one of the Gingles factors, racial polarization. Finally, the plaintiffs\nin Askew bore the burden of discounting minority success because they were attempting to prove\nan “essential element” of their section 2 claim, whereas appellees in this case bore the burden of\nproving those Senate factors (e.g., Senate Factor 7, minority electoral success) that they believed\nweighed in their favor. 127 F.3d at 1385.\n\n                                                  21\n\fwithout foundation that black candidates and would-be candidates are more “apathetic”\n\nthan their white counterparts. In response, appellees contend that the record supports the\n\ndistrict court’s finding.\n\n       We do not find that the district court clearly erred in rendering its finding on\n\nSenate Factor 5. In this circuit, it is well-established that “when there is clear evidence of\n\npresent socioeconomic or political disadvantage resulting from past discrimination, . . .\n\nthe burden is not on the plaintiffs to prove that this disadvantage is causing reduced\n\npolitical participation, but rather is on those who deny the causal nexus to show that the\n\ncause is something else.” Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1569 (collecting cases). Thus, Senate\n\nFactor 5 should have weighed in appellants’ favor unless appellees offered a\n\npreponderance of evidence that something other than the lingering effects of past\n\ndiscrimination caused the low number of black candidates.\n\n       Appellees point to four portions of the record that they contend support the district\n\ncourt’s finding: (1) testimony that “blacks have frequently not known nor asked about\n\nalternatives to paying qualifying fees”; (2) Solomon’s testimony that he “did not know a\n\nvoter registration list was available to assist in targeting people who are more likely to\n\nvote”; (3) Solomon’s testimony that “getting to know the public is also a big part of” a\n\nsuccessful campaign; and (4) testimony from Dr. Billings, appellee’s expert witness, that\n\n“Jennings’s electoral success in 1990 resulted in large part from becoming more\n\nknowledgeable about the political process in Liberty County, and running a very personal\n\nkind of campaign.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1564-65 n.101 (internal quotation marks\n\n                                             22\n\fand record citations omitted). In addition, the district court provided additional examples\n\nsupporting its finding that socio-economic disparities did not hinder black political\n\nparticipation in Liberty County. We believe that appellee’s contentions, along with other\n\nsubsidiary findings that the district court made, support the conclusion that the district\n\ncourt’s finding that “the greatest obstacle to effective black participation in the political\n\nprocess has been a lack of knowledge of the dynamics of running effective campaigns”\n\nwas not clearly erroneous. Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1564.\n\n                                                C.\n\n       Finally, we discuss appellants’ assertion that the district court clearly erred in its\n\noverall finding of no vote dilution. Our review of this issue, of course, must take into\n\naccount the error that we have already found. In section V, part A, we found clear error\n\nin the district court’s reliance on Jennings’s post-en banc electoral success. This error\n\ntainted the court’s weighing Senate Factors 4 and 7 (but not proportionality as to the\n\ncounty commission) in favor of appellees.8\n\n       That leaves us with the three Gingles factors, Senate Factors 2 and 3, and lack of\n\nproportionality (only as to the school board) weighing in favor of appellants,\n\nproportionality (only as to the county commission, and accorded less weight because of\n\n       8\n          Because the district court’s finding of proportionality regarding Jennings’s election to\nthe county commission is accorded less weight, and because the lack of proportionality on the\nschool board is not dispositive to our reversal, we assume without deciding that De Grandy’s\nproportionality factor properly applies where, as here, an at-large election system – as opposed to\na single-member voting district – is challenged. See De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1014 n.11 (defining\n“proportionality” as the relationship between “the number of majority-minority [single-member]\nvoting districts [and] minority members’ share of the relevant population[]”).\n\n                                                23\n\fthe timing of Jennings’s election) and Senate Factor 5 weighing in favor of appellees, and\n\nSenate Factors 1, 6, 8 and 9 and the absence of racial bias also weighing in favor of\n\nappellees. A review of this record leaves us with “a definite and firm conviction that a\n\nmistake has been committed.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573. First and foremost,\n\nappellants’ unquestionable establishment of the three Gingles factors, that is,\n\ncompactness/numerousness, minority cohesion and majority bloc voting, cuts very\n\nstrongly in their favor. As the Third, Fifth and Tenth Circuits have observed, “it will be\n\nonly the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish the existence of the three\n\nGingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation of § 2 under the totality of\n\ncircumstances.” Jenkins v.

All ten judges of the\n\nen banc court agreed that appellants proved the Gingles factors “as a matter of law,” and\n\nat least five of those judges found that appellants “adduced strong evidence establishing\n\nthe other supportive [that is, Senate] factors.” Solomon II, 899 F.2d at 1013 (per curiam),\n\n& 1016-17 n.3 (Kravitch, J., specially concurring) (emphasis added).

See Solomon I, 865 F.2d at 1584 (“[C]lass opposition\n\nto the remedy that may result from the successful litigation of a section 2 claim is\n\nirrelevant in weighing the totality of circumstances.”); Solomon III, 957 F.

Supp. at\n\n1560-61 (Senate Factor 3); see generally Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1510 (“Of particular concern\n\nare electoral structures, such as at-large elections in areas with white majorities, that\n\nproduce racial vote dilution because ‘[t]he right to vote can be affected by a dilution of\n\nvoting power as well as by an absolute prohibition on casting a ballot.’”) (quoting Allen\n\nv. State Bd. of Elections, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569 (1969)) (plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J.).\n\nIn its original memorandum opinion, the district court pointedly explained the\n\nsignificance of Liberty County’s size: “Liberty County does present a vast area to cover\n\nin an at-large campaign, and this factor could work to the detriment of black candidates\n\nbecause of their lower average income.” 1987 Memorandum Opinion at 13; cf.\n\nMcMillan, 748 F.2d at 1044 & n.17 (county’s size of 657 square miles “enhance[d] the\n\nproblems faced by blacks seeking access to the political process”); Marengo, 731 F.2d at\n\n1570 (county’s “small population” and “large, rural area” rendered it expensive to\n\ncampaign “county-wide . . . for an at-large position”). The disturbing fact that Liberty\n\nCounty’s blacks earn, on average, less than a third of the amount that whites earn\n\nintensifies this effect. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1563 (“While the average per\n\ncapita income for whites in the county is $ 13,127, the average per capita income for\n\nblacks is only $ 3,935.”); cf. Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1570 (“Since blacks earn, on average,\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fless than half of the amount that whites earn, the district court correctly found that the\n\nsize of the county contributes to dilution.”) (emphasis added).9 Finally, to date, “[b]lacks\n\nhave not achieved proportional representation on the Liberty County School Board.”\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp at 1570 (De Grandy factor).\n\n       In contrast to the evidence favoring appellants, the evidence relative to the\n\nremaining Senate and other factors that purportedly cut in appellees’ favor – Senate\n\nFactors 1, 6, and 8 and the absence of racial bias – was anything but strong, and the\n\ndistrict court’s findings regarding Senate Factor 9 were clearly erroneous. Regarding\n\nSenate Factor 1, that appellants presented “no evidence” that Liberty County’s\n\nundisputed and extensive history of official discrimination hinders blacks’ ability to\n\nparticipate in the democratic process is, at most, a wash. Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at\n\n1559. As we explained in section V, part A of this opinion, appellees, not appellants,\n\nbore the burden of proving any Senate factor that they believed weighed in their favor.\n\nThus, appellants’ failure to produce sufficient evidence on this factor should not hurt their\n\nclaim. Equally as weak is the lack of “recent overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns\n\nin Liberty County.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1566 (Senate Factor 6); see Marengo,\n\n731 F.2d at 1571 (lack of evidence of racial appeals “should not weigh heavily against a\n\nplaintiff proceeding under the results test of section 2” because “overtly bigoted behavior\n\nhas become more unfashionable”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n       9\n          See also 1987 Memorandum Opinion at 15 (“[B]lacks in Liberty County currently bear\nthe effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health.”).\n\n                                             27\n\f       Nor is the district court’s finding of responsiveness (Senate Factor 8) significant.\n\nAs the court itself acknowledged, this factor is “less important than other factors” in the\n\ntotality of circumstances. Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1566 (citing Senate Report at 29;\n\nand Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1572); see also Gadsden, 691 F.2d at 983 (“Responsiveness . .\n\n. . has nothing to do with impact.”). Strangely, the court’s finding contradicts its original\n\nview of the evidence. Soon after the first trial, the court found that appellants had\n\n“proved a significant lack of responsiveness to the interests of blacks by Liberty County’s\n\nelected officials.” 1987 Memorandum Opinion at 19 (emphasis added). Yet, after\n\nremand, without any new relevant evidence, the court found just the opposite, that is, that\n\nboth the county commission and the school board respond to the needs of the black\n\ncommunity. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1567. These findings are irreconcilable.\n\nAt best, then, responsiveness is a close call.\n\n       With regard to Senate Factor 9, however, we find substantial evidence of clear\n\nerror in the district court’s finding that the policy underlying at-large election of school\n\nboard members, adopted in 1953, was not tenuous but instead was the result of a\n\n“citizen’s reform movement in the county to abolish the existing ward-type political\n\nsystem.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1568. The district court acknowledged that\n\n“[t]here is little question that the Florida legislature’s 1947 legislation allowing counties\n\nto adopt at-large districts for the election of school boards . . . was designed to dilute the\n\nvoting power of the black community.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1567. The district\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fcourt characterized this statute as “allowing” the adoption of at-large elections for school\n\nboards; however, the Florida Legislature chose mandatory language in constructing this\n\nstatute and this court has characterized the statute as a “requirement.” See, e.g., Solomon\n\nI, 865 F.2d at 1578 (Tjoflat, C.J., concurring); McMillan, 638 F.2d at 1245-49.\n\n       The district court also relied upon the testimony of Dr. Billings to support its\n\nconclusion on Senate Factor 9. On cross-examination, however, Dr. Billings stated\n\nspecifically that he was testifying about the use of at-large elections in Liberty County\n\nonly with respect to the county commission – not the school board. The district court\n\nfurther relied upon the results of a 1990 county referendum in which voters chose not to\n\nabolish at-large elections for the school board, with a resulting vote of 72.57% to\n\n27.43%. Statistical analysis of this result showed that black as well as white voters\n\npreferred to retain the at-large system, a fact that the district court ruled “undercut any\n\nsuggestion that the continued policy of maintaining at-large elections . . . is somehow\n\ndiscriminatory or otherwise tenuous.” Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1568. Whether the\n\nprotected class supports the challenged system, however, is irrelevant in determining\n\nwhether the system is based upon a discriminatory policy. See Solomon I, 865 F.2d at\n\n1584 (“[C]lass opposition to the remedy that may result from the successful litigation of a\n\nsection 2 claim is irrelevant in weighing the totality of circumstances.”). Thus, we\n\nconclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that Senate Factor 9 did not\n\nsupport appellants’ position in this case.\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\f       With regard to racial animus, even if we assume, without deciding, that the district\n\ncourt’s findings are sound, they certainly do not tip the scales in appellees’ favor. In fact,\n\nthe district court essentially neutralized that finding: “the lack of racial animus [in the\n\nvoting community] does not cancel out the proof provided under the other factors.”\n\nSolomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1570. Moreover, under the approach that only two judges\n\nof this court who advocate the relevance of this factor advance, appellees bore the burden\n\nof proof. See Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1515 (“[I]f the evidence [that defendant sponsors]\n\nshows, under a totality of the circumstances, that the community is not motivated by\n\nracial bias in its voting patterns, then a case of vote dilution has not been made.”)\n\n(plurality opinion of Tjoflat, C.J., and Anderson, J.). But see Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1547-60\n\n(neither the presence nor absence of racial bias in the voting community is relevant to\n\nsection 2's results test) (Hatchett, J., dissenting). It is safe to say that appellees barely\n\nexceeded, if not failed to meet altogether, that burden through cross-examination of\n\nSolomon, appellants’ witness. See Solomon III, 957 F. Supp. at 1569 (citing Solomon’s\n\ntestimony at 59, 61, 66 and 82-84).\n\n       In short, the neutral findings and evidence favoring appellees did not begin to\n\noutweigh appellants’ strong proof of the three Gingles factors and other vote dilution\n\nfactors. The district court clearly erred in finding to the contrary. We are mindful that no\n\nmechanistic formula exists under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. See De Grandy,\n\n512 U.S. at 1011 (courts should decide section 2 claims based on a “comprehensive, not\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\flimited, canvassing of relevant facts”); Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1574 (“No formula for\n\naggregating the factors applies in every case.”). Our careful, searching and practical\n\nreview of the record, however, compels us to hold that both the Liberty County\n\nCommission and the Liberty County School Board violated section 2 through their at-\n\nlarge election system. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 79-80 (courts should “carefully” consider\n\nthe totality of circumstances “based upon a searching practical evaluation of the past and\n\npresent reality”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                                 VI. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court and\n\nremand the case for the implementation of a remedy and other proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                            REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\f</pre>",
