Political parties have no control over the nomination or election processes for those offices.  Prior to 1986, however, no law prohibited political party endorsements of candidates running for such offices.  Nevertheless, because the legal status of such endorsements was unclear, political parties did not endorse candidates in 75% of California counties.  In 1986, the people of California voted overwhelmingly to adopt Proposition 49, which amended the state constitution to formalize the ban on political party endorsements:  Article II, Sec. 6(b) provides that \"[n]o political party or party central committee may endorse, support or oppose a candidate for nonpartisan office.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-appellees in this case are ten registered voters of the City and County of San Francisco, an organization of registered voters, and one of that organization's officers.  The basis of their complaint as it relates to this appeal was the refusal of the City and County of San Francisco and the San Francisco Registrar of Voters (appellants) to permit official political party and party central committee endorsements to be printed in the San Francisco Voter Pamphlet prepared for elections scheduled June 2 and November 3, 1987.  Appellants based their refusal to print such endorsements on the language of Article II, Sec. 6(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 11, 1987, plaintiffs-appellees filed suit, and in their third cause of action challenged the constitutionality of Sec. 6(b) and sought injunctive and declaratory relief.  They alleged that Sec. 6(b) violates the rights of political parties and their members to free speech and association under the first and fourteenth amendments of the Constitution<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1988, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment with regard to their third cause of action 708 F.Supp. 278, relying in large part on the reasoning of state Supreme Court Justice Grodin's concurring opinion in Unger v. Superior Court, 37 Cal.3d 612, 209 Cal.Rptr. 474, 692 P.2d 238 (1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   On May 6, 1988, the city moved to vacate the district court's judgment and was unsuccessful.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original panel of this court reversed the judgment, holding that California's compelling interest in preserving its nonpartisan system of government for local and judicial offices justified the infringement of the plaintiffs' first amendment rights effected by Sec. 6(b).  880 F.2d 1062.    We took this case en banc in order to reconsider the panel's decision.  Upon reconsideration, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The broad authority of the states to prescribe the procedures governing local elections \"does not extinguish the State's responsibility to observe the limits established by the first amendment rights of the State's citizens.\"    Eu v. San Francisco Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1019, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).  In reviewing a challenge to a provision of a state's election laws, we first consider whether the provision burdens rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments.  Id.  If the enactment at issue impairs the first amendment rights of political parties and their members, \"it can survive constitutional scrutiny only if the State shows that it addresses a compelling state interest ... and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\"    Id. 109 S.Ct. at 1019-20 (citations omitted);  First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 786, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is indisputable that the restrictions embodied in Sec. 6(b) implicate appellees' first amendment rights.  The ban on endorsements directly affects political speech, \"the inviolability of which rests at the core of the First Amendment.\"    San Francisco Democratic Cent. Comm. v. Eu, 826 F.2d 814, 833 (9th Cir.1987), aff'd, 489 U.S. 214, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).  As the Supreme Court has made clear, \"[a]dvocacy of the election or defeat of candidates ... is no less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy or defeat of legislation.\"    Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 48, 96 S.Ct. 612, 648, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976).  And because the exercise of these basic first amendment freedoms traditionally has been through the media of political associations, political parties as well as party adherents enjoy rights of political expression and association.  Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1211, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Sec. 6(b)'s prohibitions do impair appellees' first amendment rights, the burden is on the government to show a compelling state interest justifying the regulation.  Eu, 826 F.2d at 833 (quoting Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 786, 98 S.Ct. at 1421).    Appellants declare Sec. 6(b) essential to preserving the nonpartisan nature of California's system of electing local and judicial officials and assert that the State's interest in the \"fair and impartial administration of government\" is compelling enough to warrant Sec. 6(b)'s ban on partisan endorsements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to avoid the constitutional minefield of claiming first amendment restrictions to be justified for the purpose of preventing \"undue influence on voters\" and guiding the electorate to make sensible choices, see, e.g., Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 789-91, 98 S.Ct. at 1422-24, appellants characterize their concern as an interest in the end product of Sec. 6(b)'s restrictions on political party speech:  i.e., prevention of a return of political party domination of local government and diminished voter confidence in local public officials.  See, e.g., Amicus Curiae Brief of Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los Angeles, at 3 (California's concern \"does not relate to the impact that endorsements may have on voters' choices but rather to the indirect impact on elected officials' independence from partisan political pressures\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As support the State cites Supreme Court cases upholding limits on campaign contributions and spending, contending that political party endorsements create the same risks of corruption or the appearance of corruption that the Court previously has determined justify governmental regulation of election spending.  The analogy is flawed.  In its most recent pronouncement in this area, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990), the Court upheld a provision of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act prohibiting corporations from using general treasury funds for independent expenditures in connection with state candidate elections.  In its defense Michigan contended that the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitated some regulation of their political expenditures in order to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.  Id. at 1397.    Affirming that, in previous cases, \"[w]e ... have recognized that 'the compelling governmental interest in preventing corruption support[s] the restriction of the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form,' \" id.  (quoting FEC v. Nat'l Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 500-01, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 1470, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985) (NCPAC )), the Court found the Michigan statutory provision a legitimate check upon \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the [state-conferred] corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\"    Id. at 1397.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The corruption the Court found properly addressed by the Michigan statute was not of the kind decried by California here.  Under the definition applied in past cases, \"[c]orruption is a subversion of the political process\" whereby \"[e]lected officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns.\"    NCPAC, 470 U.S. at 497, 105 S.Ct. at 1468;  see also Austin, 110 S.Ct. at 1421 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  \"The hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo:  dollars for political favors.\"    NCPAC, 470 U.S. at 497, 105 S.Ct. at 1468.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Court explicitly has excluded from its definition the kind of conduct California seeks to prevent with Sec. 6(b):  \"[t]he fact that candidates and elected officials may alter or reaffirm their own positions on issues in response to political messages ... can hardly be called corruption, for one of the essential features of democracy is the presentation to the electorate of varying points of view.\"    Id at 498, 105 S.Ct. at 1468.    The rationale underlying \"the long history of regulation of corporate political activity\" thus simply is not available as a justification for the complete suppression of speech by political parties, regardless of whether the elections in question are partisan or nonpartisan in nature.  See FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 256, 107 S.Ct. 616, 627, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986) (MCFL ) (emphasis added).  As the Court said in exempting Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting respect for the rights of the unborn, from Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibitions on corporate expenditures of treasury funds on behalf of federal candidates:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[such groups] do not pose [any] danger of corruption.    MCFL was formed to disseminate political ideas, not to amass capital.  The resources it has available are not a function of its success in the economic marketplace, but its popularity in the political marketplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 259, 107 S.Ct. at 628-29 (emphasis added).  That description applies equally well to the political parties targeted by Sec. 6(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Eu we considered a similar ban on partisan endorsements before party primaries in California.  Finding that \"[w]ith the exception of cases upholding laws carefully tailored to proscribe fraud and corruption,\" the State had \"cite[d] no authority for the proposition that the government can regulate the flow of information between political associations and their members,\" we held that the ban \"patently infringe[d] both the right of the party to express itself freely and the right of party members to an unrestricted flow of political information.\"    826 F.2d at 835.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that Eu is distinguishable because it involved party endorsements in elections for partisan offices and because the state interest advanced here--i.e., in preventing the appearance or reality of \"corruption\" of nonpartisan officeholders--is more compelling.  Having dealt with the latter contention above, we observe with regard to the first that there is nothing in this court's Eu opinion or the Supreme Court's affirmance of that opinion which suggests that either analysis was in any way dependent upon the fact that partisan offices were at issue.  The concern in both fora was with the State's abridgement of the rights of political parties and their members to exchange ideas and information, not with the nature of the elections at issue.  See, e.g., 109 S.Ct. at 1020 (\"[a] 'highly paternalistic approach' limiting what people may hear is generally suspect, but it is particularly egregious where the State censors the political speech a political party shares with its members\") (citations omitted);  826 F.2d at 835 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to find the state interests underlying Sec. 6(b) compelling, we still would be bound to declare the amendment invalid, because appellants have failed to show that Sec. 6(b) is narrowly tailored to achieve its purported objectives.  See Eu, 826 F.2d at 834 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Serv.  Comm., 447 U.S. 530, 540, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2334, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980)).  The State claims that Sec. 6(b) is narrowly drawn because only political parties and their county central committees are prohibited from endorsing, supporting, or opposing nonpartisan candidates;  individuals are not subject to its restrictions.  But as we have noted, supra at 283, political parties as well as party adherents possess rights of expression and association under the first amendment, and the mere fact that Sec. 6(b) targets the collective rather than the individual voices of party members does not suffice to render it \"precisely drawn.\"    See Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 777, 98 S.Ct. at 1416 (\"[t]he inherent worth of [political] speech ... does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in the campaign contribution and expenditure cases appellants cite as support for their position, the Supreme Court consistently has emphasized the limited nature of the restrictions it has upheld and the availability of alternative avenues of expression for the affected speakers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   As the Court observed in Buckley, with regard to the narrow provisions of the FECA it found to be constitutional:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[s]ignificantly, the Act's contribution limitations in themselves do not undermine to any material degree the potential for robust and effective discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual citizens, associations, the institutional press, candidates, and political parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">424 U.S. at 28-29, 96 S.Ct. at 639-40 (emphasis added).  Obviously, the same cannot be said of Sec. 6(b);  it imposes a total ban on any partisan gesture of support for or opposition to a candidate.  Accordingly, the district court below specifically found that the State could adequately safeguard the interests Sec. 6(b) was designed to protect by less drastic means, including provision for non-partisan methods of nominating candidates for local and judicial offices and controls on partisan activities of the candidates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject appellants' assertion that allowing party endorsements will lead inexorably to party usurpation of the nomination process for nonpartisan candidates;  the seventy years of nonpartisan government celebrated by appellants were achieved without benefit of a formal ban on partisan advocacy, and the State has offered nothing but speculative evidence to support its contention that the invalidation of Sec. 6(b) will generate a disastrous departure from the experience of the past.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5--1\" id=\"fn5--1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not unmindful that \"the Constitution grants to the States a broad power [to regulate Congressional elections under] Art.  I, Sec. 4, cl. 1, which power is matched by state control over the election process for state offices.\"    Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 217, 107 S.Ct. 544, 550, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986);  see also Oregon v.

But as the Supreme Court has emphasized, the state's power to protect the integrity of its electoral processes \"does not justify, without more, the abridgement of fundamental rights, such as the right to vote, see Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 6-7, 84 S.Ct. 526, 529, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964), or, as here, the freedom of political association.\"    Tashjian, 479 U.S. at 217, 107 S.Ct. at 550;  see also Miami Herald v.

However, in an effort to ensure that no one will be misled by the ostensible teachings of history, I submit this separate concurrence responding to Judge Alarcon's thesis that today's political parties pose a fundamental threat to democratic institutions in California and that their endorsements bring with them the taint of corruption.  I also write to comment on the concerns raised in his opinion regarding the independence of California's judiciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* There is always a danger in too facile an application of the principle that important lessons may be learned from past events.  The problem is similar to the one we frequently experience with those who claim to be expert in determining the original intent of our founding fathers.  In both cases, it is the level of generality that is critical, and that so badly confounds the pseudo-experts.  In short, \"students\" sometimes learn the wrong lesson from history--they discern the wrong message not by getting the historical facts wrong but by concentrating on superficial statements or inferences rather than on the fundamental principles that underlie them.  For example, it is certainly true, as a matter of historical fact, that the American colonists found it necessary to be vigilant against roving bands of Indians.  However, for a modern student of our early history to draw from that fact the lesson that we must today be constantly on the alert against \"predatory\" Native Americans would be rather foolish.  On the other hand, to learn, as a result of our early experience, a more fundamental lesson--namely, that individuals may find it necessary to band together in their common defense--might show a modicum of wisdom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, it does not take much wisdom to know that, whatever the cause of the problems in municipal government in the early 1900s, today's threat to the integrity of the political process comes not from the Republican or Democratic parties--or even from the Libertarians--but rather from the corrupting influence of money in politics--that is, from massive political contributions.  All recent California governors have, of course, been nominated by political parties, while California mayors have, since the days noted by Judge Alarcon, been elected in nonpartisan races.  Yet there is no reason to think that recent governors, like Pat Brown, Ronald Reagan, Jerry Brown, and George Deukmejian, have been more subject to corruption, in any form, than mayors, like Pete Wilson, Dianne Feinstein, Tom Bradley, Sam Yorty, and Joe Alioto.  In fact, today's problems concerning the lack of integrity in government may well stem in substantial part from the weakening of the political party system, both locally and nationally.  Throughout the nation, candidates no longer can look to the party to assume responsibility for the cost of their campaigns.  Conversely, parties no longer can impose discipline on individuals elected to office as the party's standard bearers.  These days public officials and would-be public officials must go directly to the big monied interests and beg for the funds necessary to finance their campaigns.  In modern-day America, there simply is no reason to associate partisanship with corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a basic fallacy in Hiram Johnson's notions of reform.  Eliminating the middle-man does not do much to solve the fundamental problem of corruption.  In fact, in this case it may have exacerbated it.  We are told that in the early 1900s the Southern Pacific Railroad was the villain, that it controlled both the legislature and the political parties.  Strangely, while Johnson's reforms deliberately weakened the party structure, they left the Southern Pacific wholly untouched, free to contribute, free to endorse, free to promote its own candidates regardless of their ideology.  Accordingly, the reforms not only compelled candidates to deal directly with the Southern Pacific and its lobbyists, but made them more dependent on the railroad's contributions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>   Political reforms are always well intended.  Frequently, however, they, like ill-thought-through history lessons, address only the superficial evil and fail to consider the underlying problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not to say that the people of California do not have the right to use a system of nonpartisan elections for filling local and judicial offices.  No one quarrels with that right.  But the people of California may not suppress free speech on the excuse that they are merely determining the method by which candidates will be elected.  For nearly eighty years, California's local and judicial elections have been \"nonpartisan.\"    Traditionally, and as California has applied the term, a nonpartisan election means that the candidates who appear on the general-election ballot are not selected by political parties.  Cal.Elec.Code Sec. 37.  Anyone can run in the primary, not just persons registered in a particular political party.  E.g., Cal.Elec.Code Secs. 22836 &amp; 25301.  If any one of the primary candidates in a nonpartisan election receives a majority of the votes, he is elected;  otherwise, the two individuals who receive the highest number of votes face each other in the general election.  Cal.Elec.Code Secs. 6611, 6612, &amp; 7202.  In any event, all citizens, regardless of party affiliation, are eligible to participate in all stages of the nonpartisan election process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California may continue to hold elections that are nonpartisan in the traditional sense.  But there is all the difference in the world between refusing to delegate to political parties the decision as to which candidates appear on the general-election ballot and prohibiting political party organizations from announcing their views on the merits of candidates seeking public office.  The latter directly infringes on the right of free speech.  As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[T]he first amendment 'has its fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\"    Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, 489 U.S. 214, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1020, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).  Prohibitions on endorsements \"directly hamper[ ] the ability of a party to spread its message and hamstring[ ] voters seeking to inform themselves about the candidates and the campaign issues.\"    109 S.Ct. at 1020.    \"[I]t is particularly egregious where the State censors the political speech a political party shares with its members.\"    109 S.Ct. at 1020.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, in short, is not a matter of how to define or structure a \"nonpartisan election.\"    It is instead a question of the right of individuals to band together and express their collective views on a matter of public concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>   Unless the state can demonstrate a compelling need to do so, it cannot limit such speech.  That the speech is collective rather than individual is of no import.  The state may no more prevent Republicans in Los Angeles County from announcing their collective position on candidates for nonpartisan office than it could prevent an individual Republican party member from running for a nonpartisan office, or from proclaiming during the campaign that he is a member of the Grand Old Party and that he intends, if elected, to follow its tenets unswervingly.  Similarly, of course, the state could not prevent members of political parties from voting in an election to select a nonpartisan office-holder.  While the state may have a compelling interest in maintaining its nonpartisan election structure for certain offices, there are obvious limits to what it may concern itself with.  It may select the form of local government it wishes and prescribe procedures for its implementation;  however, it has no compelling interest in limiting the people's right to make informed choices or to select candidates for office on whatever basis they deem relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent's description of California's populist reforms should not inadvertently mislead anyone into believing that Hiram Johnson and his reformers long ago enacted a prohibition against endorsements in nonpartisan elections.  The reformers were not that out of touch with our Constitution.  To the contrary, political parties were free to make endorsements in nonpartisan races in the period following the Johnson reforms, right up until 1986.  Only then did the voters adopt the no-endorsement rule that Judge Alarcon now finds so essential to the preservation of the republic.  Until the adoption of the initiative measure in 1986, political parties were free to, and did, endorse in numerous nonpartisan elections.  As Justice Mosk wrote in Unger v. Superior Court, in California it was \"customary for the governing bodies of political parties to endorse or assist candidates in elections for nonpartisan office.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>   And prior to 1986, few thought that the political process was in any great danger as a result.  Thus, historical events of the early 1900s cannot provide the basis for limiting the free speech rights of today's California Democrats, Republicans, and minor party members.  Nor can the limitation of that speech be deemed necessary to the proper functioning of the nonpartisan election system.  In reaching those conclusions, I note that nowhere in the record is there a whit of evidence that party endorsements in nonpartisan elections ever, even on a single occasion, led to corruption or evil of any kind--almost eighty years of endorsements in nonpartisan races and not one example of a public official being unduly or improperly influenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, recent experience tends to suggest that the influence of party organizations is not nearly as great as Judge Alarcon fears.  Only a few months ago the California Democratic party made endorsements in the statewide partisan primary for the first time.  The endorsed candidates for Governor and Insurance Commissioner, the only two seriously contested statewide posts for which endorsements were made, both lost by substantial margins.  In nonpartisan races, the voice of political party organizations is likely to be even less effective.  Ordinarily endorsements in those races are made on a local level;  there, the endorsing bodies are the county central committees, which are notoriously uninfluential organizations.  In any event, in nonpartisan races, as in partisan ones, the party's voice is but one of many that seek, whether for selfish or idealistic reasons, to persuade voters to cast their ballots one way or the other.  The only difference is that in nonpartisan races the party's voice is even more attenuated since its message is directed not only at its own members but at the electorate at large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I have already noted, political parties have the same right as others to make their views known;  their speech may not be suppressed unless the state can demonstrate that it is necessary to do so for compelling reasons.  Eu, 109 S.Ct. at 1019-20.    It is also important to note that the result would be no different here even if political parties' endorsements carried great weight and influenced voters inordinately.  For speech cannot be prohibited on the ground that it is effective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a>   In any event, in this case those arguing that a compelling governmental interest warrants limiting the right of members of political parties to make known their collective views have completely failed to carry their burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Judge Alarcon's dissent touches on a critical and sensitive subject when it discusses the question of the independence of the California state judiciary--and the threat to that independence that purportedly arises when political parties are free to express their views regarding the qualifications or records of candidates for judicial office.  My colleague's argument is paradoxical indeed, and, implicitly but unavoidably, raises the basic question whether judges who are forced to stand for election can be independent.  The threat to the independence of elected judges stems from the fact that they are dependent for their livelihood and continued employment on the political process.  They must all stand for election at one time or another, either initially, shortly after their appointment, or at the end of their first and subsequent terms.  Cal. Const. art.  VI Sec. 16.  Some raise large sums of money and seek support from persons and pressure groups with particular interests that will come before them.  Judicial candidates are rated by various interest groups and are questioned about their decisions--sometimes about the very issues listed in Judge Alarcon's dissent.  None of this appears to cause my dissenting colleague any concern--except for the fact that one of the groups that may endorse a judicial candidate may be a political party organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The paradox I find in Judge Alarcon's position lies in the assumption that judges can remain independent though compelled to seek financial contributions and other assistance, including endorsements, from powerful special interests and pressure groups, but that their very integrity may crumble if they ask members of a political party publicly to proclaim their collective support.  As far as I am concerned, one can make a plausible argument that judges who must run for election cannot be fully independent--that their decisions on controversial issues will be suspect--that they are too susceptible to pressures arising out of personal concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a>   Or, on the other hand, one can argue that good judges, being strong-willed, intellectually disciplined, and highly principled, will disregard the effects of being compelled to seek, and accept, the aid of those whose basic interests are regularly at stake in their courts.  But it cannot be seriously argued, in my view, both that the typical judge is strong enough to ignore the temptation to succumb to the influence of those who can truly control his destiny--the powerful interests, the big contributors, even the governor who has it solely within his power to make a career advancement possible<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>--and, at the same time, that the typical judge is so weak, morally or ethically, that he will not be willing to disagree in subsequent judicial opinions with so much as a single plank of the platform of a political party that has given him nothing more than its endorsement.  That argument simply does not make sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can, of course, learn from history, and the events surrounding recent judicial elections in California shed significant light on the problem we are asked to resolve.  In the 1986 statewide general election, three members of the California Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice, were voted out of office because a majority of the electorate disagreed with the perceived views of those justices on controversial issues.  The election was not one in which either major political party made an official endorsement.  However, endorsements there were--and campaign contributions for and against the justices totalling more than eleven million dollars.  A wide variety of special interest groups--insurance companies, oil and gas interests, large corporate employers, agricultural conglomerates, prosecutors, and other law enforcement officials--poured money into the campaign coffers of the organizations formed to defeat justices who wrote or joined in opinions those groups deemed harmful to their economic or professional interests.  On the other side, personal-injury and criminal-defense lawyers who agreed in general with the Court's decisions rallied to the support of the beleaguered judicial officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the months preceding this nonpartisan election, the three embattled justices were forced to appear on television to plead their cases, and to seek the endorsements of powerful newspapers, bar organizations, and prominent lawyers.  Most important, however, the justices were compelled to seek large amounts of money from potential campaign contributors so that they could convey their messages to the voters.  True, they could have kept silent--but if the people of the state want elections for judges, they must also want a fair and full debate on the issues;  and a fair and full statewide debate these days costs many millions--at least if, as was the fact in the 1986 California election, the opponents of incumbent judges conduct a full-scale, paid media campaign with thirty-second spots designed to inflame the passions and prejudices of the voters.  Statistics from other states suggest that California's experience in the 1986 race was not unique.  Seven million dollars was spent in Ohio's nonpartisan elections for the state Supreme Court that same year.  Even back in 1980, three open seats on the Texas Supreme Court generated campaign expenses of nearly two million dollars.  Uelman, California Judicial Retention Elections, 28 Santa Clara L.Rev. 333, 348 n. 44 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Money is no less important in the case of California's trial-court judges;  a survey conducted by the California Judges' Association is informative in this connection.  One judge who responded to the survey wrote, \"[M]y 'reasons for winning' ... are as follows:  (1) Money;  (2) Organization;  (3) An early start;  (4) Money;  (5) An 'excellent' candidate;  (6) A weak opponent;  (7) Excellent public relations and use of media advice;  (8) Money;  (9) Luck.\"    Schotland, Elective Judges' Campaign Financing:  Are State Judges' Robes the Emperor's Clothes of American Democracy?    2 J.L. &amp; Pol. 57, 155 (1985) (emphasis in original).  This dependence on contributors may actually affect a trial-court judge more significantly than an appellate judge, since a large portion of the necessary money is contributed by lawyers who may then or later (or indeed, regularly) have cases pending in the candidate's court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the above, the California provision prohibiting endorsements by political parties appears to be a particularly peculiar way of addressing the problem of maintaining judicial independence.  Obviously, the dependence of judges on campaign contributions represents a far greater threat to the integrity of California's judiciary than does the possibility that some judicial candidates may be endorsed by political party organizations.  Yet the state has not regulated the solicitation of campaign funds by incumbent or would-be judges, even though, as Chief Judge Goodwin points out in the majority opinion, the financial influences condoned by the state of California are not entitled to as much protection under the Constitution as the core political expression the state seeks to suppress.  See FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. 238, 257-59, 107 S.Ct. 616, 627-29, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986);  FEC v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 497, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 1468, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985).  If contributions and endorsements are to be treated differently under the first amendment, one would expect the state to afford greater, not lesser, constitutional protection to the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In actuality, the prohibition of endorsements appears to be counterproductive, for it increases the dependence of judicial candidates on campaign contributions.  Endorsements permit the judge to get his name before the public in a favorable light at no expense to himself.  Shutting off that avenue may well require him to find other means of attempting to make his name a household word in a few short months.  Almost all those other means will involve the expenditure of substantial amounts of money.  For example, a judge may file a candidate's statement which will be mailed to the voters by the county along with other election material, such as the statewide and local ballot arguments.  The rub is that the judge must pay the cost of the mailing, Cal.Elec.Code Sec. 10012, a cost well beyond the means of most judicial officers.  In the most recent election in Los Angeles County, the cost--to a candidate for the position of Superior Court judge--of distributing a biographical statement to the voters was over $62,000, and that cost was approximately fifteen percent higher than the cost at the time of the previous election only two years earlier.  Campaign costs for all means of communication have escalated comparably--and rapidly--and the need for judges and would-be judges to engage in serious fund raising activities continues to grow each year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if it were constitutionally permissible to ban some forms of speech in judicial campaigns, there is no warrant for singling out political endorsements.  In part, this is because the political parties have as much right to make known their views regarding candidates for judicial office as do the Crime Victims for Court Reform, the Law and Order Campaign Committee, the District Attorneys' Association of California, the National Organization for Women, or the San Francisco Chronicle, all of which took official positions in California's 1986 retention election.  The fact is that suppressing the views of political parties leaves the field free to special interest groups that have narrow, often single-issue agendas they wish to advance through the courts.  California's endorsement ban permits those groups to promote their chosen candidates without fear of countervailing messages from broader-based political parties which tend to take a more balanced view, and which consider candidates' overall records, qualifications, and judicial philosophy.  And California's choice must seem particularly irrational to anyone familiar with the regrettable propensity of those who manage judicial campaigns to pander to the voters' lack of familiarity with the processes of the law, and particularly the criminal law.  Again, California's experience in 1986 provides a telling example:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[I]magine the power of the 30-second television spot:  here was a stomach-turning crime, committed by a person whose humanity was cloaked in blood;  here is the mother, or the grandmother, or the daughter of the victim lamenting her loss, and suggesting, or implying, that the California Supreme Court, in its unalterable opposition to the death penalty, and in defiance of the public will, had in reliance upon some unidentified technicality set the defendant loose on the streets.  Of course, it was no technicality, but a matter of constitutional or statutory right, and of course the defendant was not turned loose, but returned for retrial--in fact by the time the opposition ran the principal ad I have described, the defendant in the case had already been retried, reconvicted, and sentenced to death.  But try explaining all of that effectively in 30 seconds on television, or in any manner sufficient to offset the emotional impact of the opponents' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grodin, supra note 7, at 366-67.  See also Forum, The Robed Politician, L.A. Law., Mar. 1979, at 12.  Given that many of the arguments befouling today's judicial campaigns are harmful to the health of the state judiciary, there is little reason to single out political endorsements, which are surely a cut above much that currently passes for \"debate on public issues [that is] uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\"    New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 720, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, anyone familiar with California's judicial elections must be aware that prohibiting official party endorsements cures none of the ills cited by supporters of the ban.  First, to the extent that one is concerned about the use of \"litmus tests\" for judicial candidates, the concern is misdirected.  As I have already suggested, party organizations are far less likely to use \"single-issue\" determinants of judicial fitness than are many powerful interest groups that participate in election campaigns, such as the National Rifle Association, the National Abortion Rights Action League, or the Right to Life Committee.  Silencing the voice of political parties serves only to increase the strength of the message being delivered by other groups with narrower or less public-spirited objectives.  Under these circumstances, it could well be argued that Judge Alarcon's \"frightened incumbent who has been subjected to media criticism for an unpopular decision,\" post, at 313, should welcome the broader perspective the political parties offer and the support their endorsements can bring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if the concern is rather that endorsements will be made on the basis of political allegiances that have nothing to do with judicial fitness, that is not an appropriate consideration on which to base a measure outlawing speech.  Voters are free to accept or reject endorsements made on the basis of political beliefs, just as they are free to base their ultimate choice on their own view of the judicial candidates's political or judicial philosophy.  Moreover, it is obvious that the \"slate mailers\" that frequently substitute for authentic endorsements have even less relation to the character or ability of the candidate.  Today's judicial elections, for the trial courts at least, are marked by the widespread use of pseudo-official mailers that contain endorsements of candidates for both partisan and nonpartisan office.  Republican candidates for partisan office are listed on slates addressed to Republican voters;  Democratic slates contain the names of Democratic candidates and are mailed to Democratic party members.  In each case, the names of the \"endorsed\" judicial candidates are listed as well.  However, the decision as to which candidates will appear on the slate mailers is made not in a democratic manner by the members or officers of an official party organization;  instead, it is made by private entrepreneurs, some of whom sell space--that is, endorsements--to the highest bidder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   Many of these private slate mailers, despite small print disclaimers, use the name of a political party and appear to the average voter to contain official party endorsements.  If political parties were to be prohibited from making endorsements in judicial campaigns, then judicial candidates who might otherwise seek an honest endorsement from a legitimate political party might be compelled to buy spurious party endorsements--to pay thousands of dollars to be included on slate mailers sent out by private operators who may have no convictions about anything.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>   Thus, even if party endorsements are made in substantial part on the basis of political affiliations, those affiliations are likely to tell the voters more about a candidate's judicial philosophy than would the fact that he can afford to purchase a spot on one or more pseudo-official slates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State of California cannot have it both ways.  If it wants to elect its judges, it cannot deprive its citizens of a full and robust election debate.  It cannot forbid speech by persons or groups who wish to make their views, support, or endorsements known.  Nor can it complain if the citizens wish to make their electoral judgments based in part on recommendations made by political parties.  If the people are to be given the right to choose their judges directly, they are free, rightly or wrongly, to consider the political philosophy of the candidates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>   They are even free, rightly or wrongly, to consider how the candidates may vote on important issues of public concern, such as abortion, capital punishment, affirmative action, gun control, and religious freedom, to name just a few.  One would have to be exceedingly naive not to be aware that a judge's judicial philosophy may influence his or her votes on important public issues that come before the court, particularly the state or federal supreme court.  Whether a judicial candidate wishes to make his views known on those issues during the electoral process is another matter.  So is the question whether it is proper for him to do so.  But those are all problems inherent in California's decision to conduct judicial elections.  If California wishes to elect its judges, it must allow free speech to prevail in the election process.  While it is undoubtedly clear to all that California could not prohibit all endorsements in judicial elections, in this case it is equally clear that it cannot single out one form of disfavored speech and ban it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the citizens of California have a choice.  If they want their judges to be free from the need to conduct full-scale political campaigns, to solicit campaign funds, to seek endorsements from political organizations and private-interest pressure groups, and, most important of all, to be free from the need to worry about whether their decisions in pending cases will affect their chances of reelection, there are options available.  California could, like the federal government, provide for the appointment of judges for life--at some or all levels of its judiciary.  Or, there are other alternatives, some more in keeping with the traditional approach of most states.  For example, California could provide that its judges must be elected or confirmed once, and that thereafter they would not need to stand for office again.  However, it is not my function to tell California what system it should use to select its judges.  There are legitimate arguments both for and against judicial elections;  and various factors to be balanced--the most important being accountability, on the one hand, versus independence, on the other.  In the end, however, any system must be judged in large measure by the quality of the judges it produces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system presently used in California has both advantages and disadvantages, as does the federal system.  However, one thing is clear:  Whatever California's ultimate decision, it may not call an election, judicial or nonjudicial, and silence citizens who wish to speak, individually or collectively, through a political party organization or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RYMER, Circuit Judge, with whom ALARCON and FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that political speech is at the core of the First Amendment, and is to be jealously protected.

Cal. Const. art.  II, Sec. 6(a);  Cal.Elec.Code Sec. 37.  No one contests the constitutionality of this structure.  Implementing it, the Legislature has enacted a number of statutes that insulate nonpartisan elections from the party apparatus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fn2-2_ref\">2</a>   When the California Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that existing law did not clearly prevent political parties from endorsing and supporting candidates for nonpartisan office,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-2\" id=\"fn3-2_ref\">3</a> the people adopted a constitutional amendment to make clear their intent that no political party or party central committee should endorse, support or oppose a candidate for nonpartisan office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question in this case is whether California has a compelling interest in the structure of its nonpartisan government, such that prohibiting political party endorsements, opposition and support of candidates for nonpartisan office is the least restrictive means by which it can be achieved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a>   The answer, I submit, requires us to consider the unique nature of this interest in our federal system, and to constrain ourselves in the interests of comity to interpret Sec. 6(b) so as to avoid unconstitutionality, if possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California's interest in this case is of extraordinary importance.  It is rooted in the United States Constitution, which assures the citizens of each state the right to determine the structure of their own government so long as it is in a republican form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a>   Because of its constitutional underpinning, the state's interest in this case is particularly compelling.  Such an interest requires a different balancing of the burdens on plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the state's justification for the burdens imposed, and the restrictiveness of the means available to accomplish the goal of preserving the nonpartisan structure of government by keeping nonpartisan offices and nonpartisan elections, nonpartisan, than either the district court or the majority has undertaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not surprising that the state's interest in the structure of its government has not been taken into account, because the City argued a different interest (avoiding corruption) in its papers.  Based on the argument that was made, the district court granted summary judgment.  On one view this was consistent with Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), because the City produced no evidence to show that the state's interests are endangered by party participation in nonpartisan elections or that Sec. 6(b) is the least restrictive means for serving its interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-2\" id=\"fn6-2_ref\">6</a>   However, in light of the significance of this issue to the people of the State of California, and the overriding importance of the interest at stake, it is appropriate that the parties, and the court, have the benefit of a more searching analysis than has occurred in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as here, both the record and the issues are inadequately developed, it is within the province of the district court to decline a summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-2\" id=\"fn7-2_ref\">7</a>   In this very special situation, I would reverse and remand to permit full consideration of the state interest I view as \"super\"-compelling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>* A</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A Republic, madam, if we can keep it\" was Benjamin Franklin's response when asked what form of government the new Constitution created.

It misapprehends the nature of the state's interest, and in so doing, undervalues it.  Second, it hypothesizes less restrictive means without considering their relationship to the interest at stake or whether they work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interest at stake is California's choice of a nonpartisan structure of government for judicial, school and municipal office.  I believe it is \"super\"-compelling.  In determining whether the limitations embodied in Sec. 6(b) sufficiently relate to that interest and are narrowly tailored to serve it, we may look to precedent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> determine that the answer is \"inherently persuasive\" or \"self-evident,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> or base a decision on legislative findings or record evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority looks to precedent and finds Eu v. San Francisco Democratic Cent. Comm. persuasive.  However, it is not possible to fit this case into that pigeonhole.  Eu involved different issues and a different interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eu had to do with the system by which a political party selects its own candidates for partisan office.  The purpose of a primary election within this structure is to settle the differences within the party, so that the majority views of the party members are carried forward to the general election.  The partisan primary election is designed to ensure that party nominations are within party lines, thus preserving the integrity of the party.  In Eu we found that regulation of internal party affairs burdens the right of political parties to govern themselves as they see fit, because a partisan primary is by definition theirs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, a nonpartisan election is by definition not theirs.  The purpose of an election within the nonpartisan structure has nothing to do with settling the internal divisions within a political party.  Rather, a nonpartisan structure abandons the political party as a conduit for the electorate's views.  Nonpartisanship envisions \"direct representation of citizens rather than indirect representation through parties as intermediaries.\"    Note, Local Nonpartisan Elections, Political Parties and the First Amendment, 87 Colum.L.Rev. 1677, 1679 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interest asserted by the state was quite different as well:  protecting political parties from disruption that might result if they were to make preprimary endorsements.  \"This interference with the parties' and their members' First Amendment rights was not justified by a compelling state interest for a State has a legitimate interest 'in orderly elections, not orderly parties.' \"    Eu, 109 S.Ct. at 1019 (quoting our opinion, 826 F.2d at 831).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, on the other hand, recognized that Eu was not dispositive<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> but it proceeded by way of assumption, and was also apparently of the view that the issue was self-evident because it granted summary judgment without a record.  Much as I respect Judge Zirpoli, I do not think the result in this case is self-evident.  If, however, my only option were to decide what is self-evident, I would say that nonpartisan means no party and there is accordingly no less restrictive means of filling a no-party office, than a no party election.  But I believe reasonable judges can reasonably differ on a sensitive issue such as this.  It is therefore unsatisfactory that we should indulge our own instincts or experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a framework within which an objective analysis could be conducted that would be commensurate with the importance of this case.  A logical starting point is how the Legislature has filled out the skeleton of the state's nonpartisan structure for judicial, school and municipal government.  A \"partisan office\" means \"an office for which a party may nominate a candidate,\" while a nonpartisan office is one whose holders have not been nominated in a partisan primary or identified on the ballot as affiliated with a political party, and who have not been elected on a partisan ballot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>   In 1986 the people of the state amended Section 6 of the California Constitution to reaffirm that \"[a]ll judicial, school, county, and city offices shall be nonpartisan\" (Sec. 6(a)) and to provide that \"[n]o political party<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> or party central committee may endorse, support, or oppose a candidate for nonpartisan office\" (Sec. 6(b)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> This was done to continue a \"long-understood ban on partisan electioneering in local and judicial elections\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> which the California Supreme Court had concluded was not enforceable under the Constitution or statutes as then drafted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, it makes sense to assess the burden Sec. 6(b) imposes on political parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   It does not prevent individuals or groups of individuals (such as the California Democratic Council or \"Democrats for Bradley\") from making endorsements.  Nor does it preclude political parties from speaking out on issues.  For example, the Republican Party could support the building of a jail in Fresno and the Democratic Party could oppose it, even though candidate A for mayor was for the building of the jail and candidate B was against it.  Narrowly construed, Sec. 6(b) does not inhibit a political party from calling attention to a candidate's record and experience and qualifications.  Further, the identification of candidates with particular parties plays much less of a role in the nurturing of an informed electorate for local, school and judicial offices, than for national (or state) elections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>   To the extent that the natural focus of a ballot-qualified party is on issues of broad application and on partisan offices such as the Presidency, the Congress, or the Governorship, party labels provide scarcely any \"shorthand designation of the views of party candidates on matters of public concern\" in connection with nonpartisan, specialized local elections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>   This is especially so since candidates for nonpartisan office neither run as a party member, nor are labelled as such on the ballot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factors should then be considered in light of the \"super\"-compelling importance of the state's interest in its chosen form of government, to determine if Sec. 6(b) is narrowly tailored, whether there are less restrictive means that serve that interest, and whether alternatives work.  The majority concludes that \"the mere fact that Sec. 6(b) targets the collective rather than the individual voices of party members does not suffice to render it 'precisely drawn.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>   I agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>   But the fact that it targets the collective voice only with respect to endorsements for nonpartisan offices may render it drawn as precisely as it can be,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> for to preclude party endorsements in nonparty elections is the flip side of a candidate's running for nonpartisan office without party identification.  It also conforms exactly to the California Election Code's definition of partisan office as one \"for which a party may nominate a candidate,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> and conversely to that of a nonpartisan office, for which a party may not nominate a candidate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"less drastic\" possibilities posited by the district court (and adopted by the majority) may be links in the chain, but cannot serve the state's structural interest if there is any missing link.  For example, Judge Zirpoli suggested that nonpartisan methods of nomination would be less restrictive.  Clearly these serve the applicable interest.  However, if nonpartisan methods of nomination were not supplemented by prohibiting party endorsements, the track to nonpartisan office would be virtually indistinguishable from the track to partisan office.  Candidates are nominated for nonpartisan office by petition which may not disclose their party affiliation;  those for partisan offices are nominated through partisan primaries.  There would thus be no material difference between a nonpartisan method of nomination, with party endorsements as Judge Zirpoli suggests, and a partisan method of election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>   Therefore it does not appear that the means of relying entirely on nonpartisan nomination methods, without the limitation in Sec. 6(b), would work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>   The district court's other suggestion, prohibiting candidates from soliciting or collecting campaign funds from political parties, might serve the state's interest in corruption, but would only incidentally advance its interest in structure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court was considering corruption, it measured neither alternative against a structural interest that is \"super\"-compelling.  While these or other means might work, there is no basis in the record for reaching a reasoned conclusion that they will or won't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the final step in the analysis ought to be whether the state's interest in the nonpartisan structure of government, constitutionally recognized in the guarantee clause, warrants a burden of the sort imposed on the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of a political party.  Both the Congress and the Supreme Court have acknowledged that there is a difference of constitutional dimension between political activity by political parties and political activities of other organizations or individual political actors.  In Civil Serv.  Comm'n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 565, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 2890, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973), the Supreme Court upheld the Hatch Act, which prohibited federal employees from involvement in political activity, against a First Amendment challenge.  In so doing, it emphasized the right of government employees to be involved with everything except political parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely there is nothing about the state's interest in the nonpartisan form of its local, school and judicial government that implicates the rights of anyone but a ballot-qualified political party from endorsing, opposing or supporting candidates for nonpartisan office.  The same goes for the rights of a political party to espouse views on controversial issues, even when those views correspond to views held by a particular candidate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was clear to the Court in Letter Carriers that the danger to proper government functioning presented by political party involvement was different in kind from the danger presented by the involvement of other organizations, ideas, considerations, or even by political actors of an independent stripe.  In other words, in the political context nonpartisanship does not mean that an officeholder adheres to no causes or factions, or even that the officeholder is not committed to the tenets or goals of a political party.  It does mean that there should not be activity that gives (or seems to give) a party any power whatever over the holder of a nonpartisan office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, there is no reason inhering in the state's interest in the structure of its government that inhibits California from justifying its restriction on endorsements in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the state's interest in the structure of nonpartisan government is so compelling, I do not believe it is necessary to reach the corruption issue.  The majority does, but its approach is flawed in a way that affects its analysis of the state's justification for Sec. 6(b).  The majority focuses solely on financial corruption of the sort addressed in Buckley, FEC v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985), and Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990), and purports to distinguish the kind of corruption \"decried\" by California in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>   However it is clear that corruption can occur from political as well as financial debt.   See, e.g., Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 565, 93 S.Ct. at 2890 (partisan political activities by government employees poses danger to \"fair and effective government\");  Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 788 n. 26, 98 S.Ct. at 1422 n. 26 (importance of government interest in preventing corruption of elected representatives through creation of political debts \"has never been doubted\");  Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. at 638.    Letter Carriers is closely on point, implicitly recognizing that partisan politics may have a corrupting influence on a system designed to be nonpartisan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>   The interest California actually asserted in this case is not that endorsement by a political party corrupts the voter by influencing him or her to cast a ballot one way or the other;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  rather, it is that endorsement corrupts the nonpartisan candidate and officeholder in the performance of his duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>   Along with the state's interest in preventing corruption of that sort, \"[p]reservation of the individual citizen's confidence in government is equally important.\"   Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 789, 98 S.Ct. at 1422.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a limitation on speech does keep information from the voters, Buckley teaches that it is permissible if there is a compelling state interest balanced against a marginal burden on First Amendment rights.  Applying Buckley to Sec. 6(b) suggests that endorsements are more analogous to large campaign contributions than to independent expenditures;  unlike independent campaign expenditures, endorsements are prearranged and coordinated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>   Unlike a contribution, however, endorsement itself creates the corruption, not the amount of endorsement.  The state therefore has a justification for banning endorsements that neither the district court nor the majority recognizes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also relies on Austin in concluding that the kind of corruption at issue here is different from that reached elsewhere.  While the relevance of Austin to this case is by no means clear, it is not unambiguous.  However tempting it may be to whitewash its holding or pick and choose what it says, the Court can fairly be read to suggest that the state's interest in avoiding corruption is reasonably furthered by restricting speech, in the form of expenditures, by organizations which have amassed political \"war chests\" with the aid of legal advantages conferred by the state.  As ballot-qualified parties have that status by virtue of statute in California, it could be said that they, too, have amassed their clout with the aid of legal advantages conferred by the state such that, in the context of a nonpartisan election, their \"war chest\" would have a correspondingly corrosive effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have an obligation to construe any law, if fairly possible, to avoid raising doubts of its constitutionality.  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769-70, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3361, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982);  Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 571, 93 S.Ct. at 2892.    However, neither the district court nor the majority tries to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue in this case is whether the City of San Francisco erred in not permitting party endorsements to appear on the official San Francisco Voter Pamphlet, in reliance on Sec. 6(b).  It is not necessary to construe Sec. 6(b) as the majority does, as \"impos[ing] a total ban on any partisan gesture of support for or opposition to a candidate.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not even plaintiffs assert that the ban encompasses \"any partisan gesture of support.\"    Plainly it does not:  parties are free to speak out on issues and relate those issues to a candidate;  partisan sub-groups are free to do anything they want in as partisan a way as they choose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More significantly, Sec. 6(b) can be construed to prohibit only endorsements, and not to extend to communications about the candidates' qualifications, position on the issues, experience or platform.  It can also be construed as applying only to public endorsements, or endorsements on the official voter information pamphlet.  In any event it could be construed not to apply to recommendations made to members.  See, e.g., United States v. CIO, 335 U.S. 106, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948) (declining to construe Sec. 313 of the Corrupt Practices Act to prohibit corporations and unions from expressing views on candidates directly to members).  To the extent Sec. 6(b) provides that a political party may not \"support or oppose\" a candidate for nonpartisan office, it may be too vague or too encompassing to be enforced.

In 1905, Ruef was successful in bringing about the election of his full slate of supervisors.  J. Caughey, supra, at 282.

Justice Mosk, joined by Justice Files and Justice Janes, concluded that article II, section 6 did not prohibit a political party from endorsing, supporting, or opposing candidates for a nonpartisan office.   Unger II, 37 Cal.3d at 620, 692 P.2d at 243, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 479.    Justice Mosk, however, did not purport to discuss the propriety or wisdom of a law that would bar endorsements on nonpartisan elections:  \"Our conclusion in this case is reached without consideration of policy questions.  We are not unmindful of the persuasive reasons why it is preferable for political parties to refrain from endorsing or opposing nonpartisan candidates.    However, that is a matter for consideration by the Legislature;  it, not the judiciary, is the proper body to impose regulations in the conduct of political parties.\"    Id., 692 P.2d at 243-44, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 479-80 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Malcolm Lucas filed a concurring opinion in which he stated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur, albeit reluctantly, in the majority opinion.  My agreement stems from my conclusion that Justice Mosk has correctly interpreted the scope of the existing restrictions imposed by the Legislature and the California Constitution.  My reluctance flows from my concern about the effect of our ruling in light of important social and political policy considerations expressed by Justice Sims in his dissent.  I think there is a strong state interest in preserving the nonpartisan nature of the offices involved and that this interest will be sorely tried if political parties engage in wholesale endorsement of and opposition to candidates for \"judicial, school, county, and city offices ....\"  (Cal.

His conclusion that the First Amendment may well bar restrictions on political endorsements of candidates for nonpartisan office is premature.  The Legislature may be able to fashion a permissible limitation on partisan involvement in nonpartisan campaigns after careful scrutiny of the various interests at stake.  I do not think that at this stage we should sweepingly discourage such an attempt. The majority opinion, of course, does not take that path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 625, 692 P.2d at 247, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 483 (Lucas, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Joseph Grodin filed a concurring opinion in which he commented that if article II, section 6 had been construed by the majority to bar a political party from endorsing, supporting, or opposing a candidate for nonpartisan office, the statute would violate the first amendment to the United States Constitution.

Justice Sims, joined by Justice Potter, expressed the view that \"the state, in pursuit of the laudable aim of freeing judicial offices from partisan consideration has properly served a compelling interest by limiting the elections in which the statutorily created party may officially participate.\"    Id. at 626, 692 P.2d at 247, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 483 (Sims, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the majority opinion and the observations of Justices Lucas and Sims that six members of the seven-person panel were of the view that there are \"persuasive reasons why it is preferable for political parties to refrain from endorsing or opposing nonpartisan candidates.\"    Unger II, 37 Cal.3d at 620, 692 P.2d at 243-44, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 479-80.    The factual justification for precluding party endorsement was not set forth in Justice Mosk's opinion.  The sordid background of party control and corruption of judicial and local offices was eloquently set forth, however, in Justice Sims' concurring opinion.  Id. at 631, 692 P.2d at 251, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 487 (Sims, J., concurring).  Thus, six out of seven members of the Unger II court appear to have been persuaded that a compelling interest still existed in 1984 that would support a law in California barring official endorsement or opposition by political parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the majority's interpretation of California's article II, section 6 in Unger II as not expressly precluding party endorsement or opposition in a nonpartisan election, Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy introduced Assembly Constitutional Amendment 7 to add subsection (b) to article II, section 6.  California voters adopted subsection (b) by a vote of 2,292,678 to 1,805,305 on June 3, 1986.  Thus, the reformation of California law to protect the independence of the judiciary and remove local offices from the control of political parties, which began in 1911, was completed 75 years later.  In 1986, a majority of Californians approved an initiative that expressly spelled out that the political reforms inspired by Hiram Johnson's populist political revolution cannot be fulfilled if party endorsement or opposition of nonpartisan candidates for judicial and local office is tolerated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-3\" id=\"fn3-3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY:</p>\n    <p>A COMPELLING CALIFORNIA IMPERATIVE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California's determination to eliminate political party domination of judicial and local office holders because of its sad experiences with the impact of party influence on the integrity and independence of elected officials led inexorably to the adoption of subsection (b).  As noted by Judge Trott in the majority opinion in Geary v. Renne, 880 F.2d 1062 (9th Cir.1989), reh'g granted en banc, 895 F.2d 1230 (9th Cir.1990), this court should not ignore \"the importance of considering a law in the context of the historical circumstances that gave rise to it.\"    Id. at 1073.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority has failed to consider or discuss the devastating effect that California's political parties had on the integrity and independence of its judges and local office holders as the result of payoffs, graft, and corruption.  This sordid record inspired the populist revolution against the corrupt domination by political parties over the daily lives of California's citizens.  I believe that California's voters have applied inspired logic to eliminate the evils brought about by party control of judicial and local office elections, by enacting legislation to make these offices nonpartisan.  I agree with my colleagues that subsection (b) places a burden on first amendment rights requiring strict scrutiny to determine whether the state has demonstrated that this restriction on protected activity is supported by a compelling state interest.  Majority op. at 283 (citing Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1019-20, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989)).  None of the cases cited by the majority, however, analyzes the question whether a state may burden first amendment rights by precluding party endorsements in nonpartisan elections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the record amply demonstrates that subsection (b) is necessary to meet California's compelling interest in maintaining the independence of the judiciary.  Regrettably, the majority makes no reference to the compelling and uncontradicted testimony presented to the district court by former Associate Justice Winslow Christian.  Justice Christian clearly qualifies as an expert on the potentially devastating impact of politics on judicial independence in California.  Justice Christian served as a trial judge in Sierra County for four years.  He was an associate justice of the California Courts of Appeal for 17 years.  He was also the Executive Director of the National Center for State Courts for several years.  Justice Christian testified that this position enabled him to study the judicial selection and tenure systems in many states.  He also \"learned that in certain states partisanship in judicial elections has damaged the reputation of the judiciary.\"    Justice Christian declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p>[ ] The state of California has a compelling interest in the independence and integrity of its judiciary.

Permitting partisanship in the process of nominating, selecting and retaining judges would force judges to seek party endorsements.  This process would create a risk of judicial candidates being tempted to promise to take party positions on legal issues which are pending or likely to arise.  This harmful feature of partisanship in judicial elections has damaged the reputation of the judicial systems of certain other states known to me.

A sturdy and resolute candidate, mindful of the canons of ethics for judicial candidates, should, of course, refuse to answer any of these questions.  A frightened incumbent who has been subjected to media criticism for an unpopular decision, or a less scrupulous, politically lean and hungry<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-3\" id=\"fn4-3_ref\">4</a> aspirant for judicial office might be tempted, as predicted by Justice Christian, \"to promise to take party positions on legal issues which are pending or likely to arise.\"<sup>5</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the real possibility that candidates will have to undergo such an inquisition in pursuit of the dangling carrots of financial support and party endorsement, subsection (b) of article II, section 6 serves California's compelling interest in safeguarding the independence of its judiciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Christian's testimony and the historical evidence of the disastrous impact on the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of local officials that resulted from party selection and endorsement was uncontroverted at these summary judgment proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historical record shows that, while California's political parties still controlled local elections, one political leader threatened the City Council of Los Angeles with the economic destruction of the community and another bribed 17 out of 18 members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.  The burden of showing that the citizens of California have a compelling state interest in avoiding Mephistophelean compacts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-3\" id=\"fn6-3_ref\">6</a> between political parties and nonpartisan candidates has been met by the officials of the City and County of San Francisco who are parties to this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p>SUBSECTION (B) AS THE ONLY REALISTIC SAFEGUARD OF POLITICAL</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>INDEPENDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, subsection (b) is narrowly tailored to satisfy California's compelling interest in freedom from party influence.  Applying the lessons of history and experience, the state of California has focused its restriction on the organizations central to the political influence that has caused such disruption in its past.  The majority, however, claims that less drastic means could be employed to further the goals of nonpartisanship.  It relies on the district court's finding that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p>the State could adequately safeguard the interests Sec. 6(b) was designed to protect by less drastic means, including provision for nonpartisan methods of nominating candidates for local and judicial offices and controls on partisan activities of the candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Majority op. at 285.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's analysis confuses preservation of the appearance of political independence with avoiding the actual lure of party influence.  As Judge Rymer notes:  \"The 'less drastic' possibilities posited by the district court may be links in the chain, but cannot serve the state's structural interest if there is any missing link.\"    Rymer dissent at 301 (emphasis added).  Justice Christian's declaration demonstrates that party endorsement of nonpartisan candidates, in and of itself, would create a legitimate threat to the entire nonpartisan framework.  The majority's proposed less drastic means are thus missing the one link that would actually shield nonpartisan candidates from party influence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it is hard to imagine any more narrowly drawn restriction that would adequately serve California's compelling state interest in the integrity of judges and local officials.  \"[A] state need not choose a rule so much less restrictive that it also is useless in achieving the state's purposes.\"    Stevenson v. State Bd. of Elections, 794 F.2d 1176, 1180 (7th Cir.1986) (Easterbrook, J. concurring);  see also Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 1282, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974) (\"[T]he Constitution does not require the states to choose ineffectual means to achieve its aims.\").  When one considers the uncontroverted reality of party power in California's history, it becomes clear that subsection (b) is narrowly drawn.  As Judge Trott noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Subsection (b) ] is limited in its coverage only to those concentrations of power that pose the greatest threat to the objectives of nonpartisanism.  All other groups, individuals, and associations are free to do as they please.  This protects the free expression and interchange of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to promote....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, article II, Sec. 6(b) is not a law aimed at ideas themselves or specific information that California wishes to suppress although concededly it has this \"indirect consequence.\"    As such, it compares favorably with the statute at issue in Eu, 109 S.Ct. at 1016.    It is a marginal and workable restriction on speech incident to a set of election rules designed to promote independence in public office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, section 6(b) is not the kind of substantial limitation or draconian restriction on free political exchange that rises to the level of incompatibility with the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">880 F.2d at 1080-81.    Because it is the only means by which California can avoid political litmus tests for judges and local officials, and thereby ensure the independence that is the goal of nonpartisanism, I believe that subsection (b) is sufficiently narrowly tailored to survive constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Blackmun has noted that \"[a] judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a little less 'drastic' or a little less 'restrictive' in almost any situation.\"    Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 188, 99 S.Ct. 983, 992, 59 L.Ed.2d 230 (1979) (Blackmun, J., concurring).  The majority offers California two watered-down and ineffective alternatives to the only practical means of ensuring political independence.  I recognize California's compelling interest in avoiding party influence over nonpartisan candidates and, like Judge Trott, I \"do not deem it prudent for the Federal judiciary to conclude without the benefit of the legislative process\" that California can adequately safeguard its interests by other means.  880 F.2d at 1080.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the district court's order granting summary judgment.

Governor Deukmejian initially opposed only Chief Justice Rose Bird, and not Associate Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph Grodin.

In the general election, the factors are different.  The party's nominees for partisan office are included automatically and only endorsements of judges and other nonpartisan candidates, as well as endorsements of ballot measures are up for grabs.  It is in fact the supporters or opponents of the latter who principally finance slate mailers.

The only difference would be that in the case of the nonpartisan track, the decision about which candidate would carry the party banner would be made by the party, not by the people as is their prerogative in the partisan track.  The irony is, this would allow political parties even greater power in the nonpartisan track than in the partisan.

The former relates primarily to the state's interest in corruption but would turn its interest in structure on its head;  the latter would too, in that presumably those administrative personnel would be appointed by persons elected in partisan elections.  Neither means comports with a nonpartisan structure, and that is a choice both the guarantee clause and the Tenth Amendment leave for the people to make</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> The state could not, for example, justify a ban on endorsements by special interest groups on the ground that government should be \"non-special interest.\"    The state's interest in the structure of government goes to such things as whether it is to be partisan or nonpartisan, town meeting or city council, appointive or elective;  the state could not rely on an interest stemming from the guarantee clause to justify a government based on religious beliefs or race or ideas.  Such things have nothing to do with structure</p>\n        <p>By the same token, if the state's asserted interest is corruption, its justification for banning endorsements by political parties is weakened because the corrupting effect of endorsements or support by a special interest group may be essentially the same.  However, clout of a special interest group has no relevance to the state's interest in the structure of government.    Special interest groups have no access to the ballot and their membership may cut across party lines.  Their raison d'etre is to influence voters and officeholders issue by issue, sometimes in accord with the views of a political party, sometimes not.  They are quintessentially non-party organizations.  By contrast, political parties have ballot access, are comprised of persons of the same political persuasion, and exist to win elections and run governments.  See Moore v. Panish, 32 Cal.3d 535, 186 Cal.Rptr. 475, 652 P.2d 32 (1982).

If a party adopted Mr. Kennedy's point of view, either out of conviction or simply because he is a loyal member, it would be entitled to endorse him and ask the voters to vote \"no\" on bussing.  By the same token, another party would be free to support Judge Gitelson, regardless of his views or qualifications, to avoid losing that office to a candidate who was registered with a rival political organization.

In 1986, the people of California voted overwhelmingly to adopt Proposition 49, which amended the state constitution to formalize the ban on political party endorsements:  Article II, Sec. 6(b) provides that \"[n]o political party or party central committee may endorse, support or oppose a candidate for nonpartisan office.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-appellees in this case are ten registered voters of the City and County of San Francisco, an organization of registered voters, and one of that organization's officers.

But as we have noted, supra at 283, political parties as well as party adherents possess rights of expression and association under the first amendment, and the mere fact that Sec. 6(b) targets the collective rather than the individual voices of party members does not suffice to render it \"precisely drawn.\"    See Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 777, 98 S.Ct. at 1416 (\"[t]he inherent worth of [political] speech ... does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in the campaign contribution and expenditure cases appellants cite as support for their position, the Supreme Court consistently has emphasized the limited nature of the restrictions it has upheld and the availability of alternative avenues of expression for the affected speakers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   As the Court observed in Buckley, with regard to the narrow provisions of the FECA it found to be constitutional:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[s]ignificantly, the Act's contribution limitations in themselves do not undermine to any material degree the potential for robust and effective discussion of candidates and campaign issues by individual citizens, associations, the institutional press, candidates, and political parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">424 U.S. at 28-29, 96 S.Ct. at 639-40 (emphasis added).

However, in an effort to ensure that no one will be misled by the ostensible teachings of history, I submit this separate concurrence responding to Judge Alarcon's thesis that today's political parties pose a fundamental threat to democratic institutions in California and that their endorsements bring with them the taint of corruption.

The problem is similar to the one we frequently experience with those who claim to be expert in determining the original intent of our founding fathers.  In both cases, it is the level of generality that is critical, and that so badly confounds the pseudo-experts.  In short, \"students\" sometimes learn the wrong lesson from history--they discern the wrong message not by getting the historical facts wrong but by concentrating on superficial statements or inferences rather than on the fundamental principles that underlie them.  For example, it is certainly true, as a matter of historical fact, that the American colonists found it necessary to be vigilant against roving bands of Indians.  However, for a modern student of our early history to draw from that fact the lesson that we must today be constantly on the alert against \"predatory\" Native Americans would be rather foolish.  On the other hand, to learn, as a result of our early experience, a more fundamental lesson--namely, that individuals may find it necessary to band together in their common defense--might show a modicum of wisdom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, it does not take much wisdom to know that, whatever the cause of the problems in municipal government in the early 1900s, today's threat to the integrity of the political process comes not from the Republican or Democratic parties--or even from the Libertarians--but rather from the corrupting influence of money in politics--that is, from massive political contributions.  All recent California governors have, of course, been nominated by political parties, while California mayors have, since the days noted by Judge Alarcon, been elected in nonpartisan races.  Yet there is no reason to think that recent governors, like Pat Brown, Ronald Reagan, Jerry Brown, and George Deukmejian, have been more subject to corruption, in any form, than mayors, like Pete Wilson, Dianne Feinstein, Tom Bradley, Sam Yorty, and Joe Alioto.  In fact, today's problems concerning the lack of integrity in government may well stem in substantial part from the weakening of the political party system, both locally and nationally.  Throughout the nation, candidates no longer can look to the party to assume responsibility for the cost of their campaigns.  Conversely, parties no longer can impose discipline on individuals elected to office as the party's standard bearers.  These days public officials and would-be public officials must go directly to the big monied interests and beg for the funds necessary to finance their campaigns.  In modern-day America, there simply is no reason to associate partisanship with corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a basic fallacy in Hiram Johnson's notions of reform.  Eliminating the middle-man does not do much to solve the fundamental problem of corruption.  In fact, in this case it may have exacerbated it.  We are told that in the early 1900s the Southern Pacific Railroad was the villain, that it controlled both the legislature and the political parties.  Strangely, while Johnson's reforms deliberately weakened the party structure, they left the Southern Pacific wholly untouched, free to contribute, free to endorse, free to promote its own candidates regardless of their ideology.  Accordingly, the reforms not only compelled candidates to deal directly with the Southern Pacific and its lobbyists, but made them more dependent on the railroad's contributions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>   Political reforms are always well intended.  Frequently, however, they, like ill-thought-through history lessons, address only the superficial evil and fail to consider the underlying problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not to say that the people of California do not have the right to use a system of nonpartisan elections for filling local and judicial offices.  No one quarrels with that right.  But the people of California may not suppress free speech on the excuse that they are merely determining the method by which candidates will be elected.  For nearly eighty years, California's local and judicial elections have been \"nonpartisan.\"    Traditionally, and as California has applied the term, a nonpartisan election means that the candidates who appear on the general-election ballot are not selected by political parties.  Cal.Elec.Code Sec. 37.  Anyone can run in the primary, not just persons registered in a particular political party.  E.g., Cal.Elec.Code Secs. 22836 &amp; 25301.  If any one of the primary candidates in a nonpartisan election receives a majority of the votes, he is elected;  otherwise, the two individuals who receive the highest number of votes face each other in the general election.  Cal.Elec.Code Secs. 6611, 6612, &amp; 7202.  In any event, all citizens, regardless of party affiliation, are eligible to participate in all stages of the nonpartisan election process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California may continue to hold elections that are nonpartisan in the traditional sense.  But there is all the difference in the world between refusing to delegate to political parties the decision as to which candidates appear on the general-election ballot and prohibiting political party organizations from announcing their views on the merits of candidates seeking public office.  The latter directly infringes on the right of free speech.  As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[T]he first amendment 'has its fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\"    Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Prohibitions on endorsements \"directly hamper[ ] the ability of a party to spread its message and hamstring[ ] voters seeking to inform themselves about the candidates and the campaign issues.\"    109 S.Ct. at 1020.    \"[I]t is particularly egregious where the State censors the political speech a political party shares with its members.\"    109 S.Ct. at 1020.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, in short, is not a matter of how to define or structure a \"nonpartisan election.\"    It is instead a question of the right of individuals to band together and express their collective views on a matter of public concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>   Unless the state can demonstrate a compelling need to do so, it cannot limit such speech.  That the speech is collective rather than individual is of no import.  The state may no more prevent Republicans in Los Angeles County from announcing their collective position on candidates for nonpartisan office than it could prevent an individual Republican party member from running for a nonpartisan office, or from proclaiming during the campaign that he is a member of the Grand Old Party and that he intends, if elected, to follow its tenets unswervingly.  Similarly, of course, the state could not prevent members of political parties from voting in an election to select a nonpartisan office-holder.  While the state may have a compelling interest in maintaining its nonpartisan election structure for certain offices, there are obvious limits to what it may concern itself with.  It may select the form of local government it wishes and prescribe procedures for its implementation;  however, it has no compelling interest in limiting the people's right to make informed choices or to select candidates for office on whatever basis they deem relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent's description of California's populist reforms should not inadvertently mislead anyone into believing that Hiram Johnson and his reformers long ago enacted a prohibition against endorsements in nonpartisan elections.  The reformers were not that out of touch with our Constitution.  To the contrary, political parties were free to make endorsements in nonpartisan races in the period following the Johnson reforms, right up until 1986.  Only then did the voters adopt the no-endorsement rule that Judge Alarcon now finds so essential to the preservation of the republic.  Until the adoption of the initiative measure in 1986, political parties were free to, and did, endorse in numerous nonpartisan elections.  As Justice Mosk wrote in Unger v. Superior Court, in California it was \"customary for the governing bodies of political parties to endorse or assist candidates in elections for nonpartisan office.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>   And prior to 1986, few thought that the political process was in any great danger as a result.  Thus, historical events of the early 1900s cannot provide the basis for limiting the free speech rights of today's California Democrats, Republicans, and minor party members.  Nor can the limitation of that speech be deemed necessary to the proper functioning of the nonpartisan election system.  In reaching those conclusions, I note that nowhere in the record is there a whit of evidence that party endorsements in nonpartisan elections ever, even on a single occasion, led to corruption or evil of any kind--almost eighty years of endorsements in nonpartisan races and not one example of a public official being unduly or improperly influenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, recent experience tends to suggest that the influence of party organizations is not nearly as great as Judge Alarcon fears.  Only a few months ago the California Democratic party made endorsements in the statewide partisan primary for the first time.  The endorsed candidates for Governor and Insurance Commissioner, the only two seriously contested statewide posts for which endorsements were made, both lost by substantial margins.  In nonpartisan races, the voice of political party organizations is likely to be even less effective.  Ordinarily endorsements in those races are made on a local level;  there, the endorsing bodies are the county central committees, which are notoriously uninfluential organizations.  In any event, in nonpartisan races, as in partisan ones, the party's voice is but one of many that seek, whether for selfish or idealistic reasons, to persuade voters to cast their ballots one way or the other.  The only difference is that in nonpartisan races the party's voice is even more attenuated since its message is directed not only at its own members but at the electorate at large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I have already noted, political parties have the same right as others to make their views known;  their speech may not be suppressed unless the state can demonstrate that it is necessary to do so for compelling reasons.  Eu, 109 S.Ct. at 1019-20.    It is also important to note that the result would be no different here even if political parties' endorsements carried great weight and influenced voters inordinately.  For speech cannot be prohibited on the ground that it is effective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a>   In any event, in this case those arguing that a compelling governmental interest warrants limiting the right of members of political parties to make known their collective views have completely failed to carry their burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Judge Alarcon's dissent touches on a critical and sensitive subject when it discusses the question of the independence of the California state judiciary--and the threat to that independence that purportedly arises when political parties are free to express their views regarding the qualifications or records of candidates for judicial office.  My colleague's argument is paradoxical indeed, and, implicitly but unavoidably, raises the basic question whether judges who are forced to stand for election can be independent.  The threat to the independence of elected judges stems from the fact that they are dependent for their livelihood and continued employment on the political process.  They must all stand for election at one time or another, either initially, shortly after their appointment, or at the end of their first and subsequent terms.  Cal. Const. art.  VI Sec. 16.  Some raise large sums of money and seek support from persons and pressure groups with particular interests that will come before them.  Judicial candidates are rated by various interest groups and are questioned about their decisions--sometimes about the very issues listed in Judge Alarcon's dissent.  None of this appears to cause my dissenting colleague any concern--except for the fact that one of the groups that may endorse a judicial candidate may be a political party organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The paradox I find in Judge Alarcon's position lies in the assumption that judges can remain independent though compelled to seek financial contributions and other assistance, including endorsements, from powerful special interests and pressure groups, but that their very integrity may crumble if they ask members of a political party publicly to proclaim their collective support.  As far as I am concerned, one can make a plausible argument that judges who must run for election cannot be fully independent--that their decisions on controversial issues will be suspect--that they are too susceptible to pressures arising out of personal concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a>   Or, on the other hand, one can argue that good judges, being strong-willed, intellectually disciplined, and highly principled, will disregard the effects of being compelled to seek, and accept, the aid of those whose basic interests are regularly at stake in their courts.  But it cannot be seriously argued, in my view, both that the typical judge is strong enough to ignore the temptation to succumb to the influence of those who can truly control his destiny--the powerful interests, the big contributors, even the governor who has it solely within his power to make a career advancement possible<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>--and, at the same time, that the typical judge is so weak, morally or ethically, that he will not be willing to disagree in subsequent judicial opinions with so much as a single plank of the platform of a political party that has given him nothing more than its endorsement.  That argument simply does not make sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can, of course, learn from history, and the events surrounding recent judicial elections in California shed significant light on the problem we are asked to resolve.  In the 1986 statewide general election, three members of the California Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice, were voted out of office because a majority of the electorate disagreed with the perceived views of those justices on controversial issues.  The election was not one in which either major political party made an official endorsement.  However, endorsements there were--and campaign contributions for and against the justices totalling more than eleven million dollars.  A wide variety of special interest groups--insurance companies, oil and gas interests, large corporate employers, agricultural conglomerates, prosecutors, and other law enforcement officials--poured money into the campaign coffers of the organizations formed to defeat justices who wrote or joined in opinions those groups deemed harmful to their economic or professional interests.  On the other side, personal-injury and criminal-defense lawyers who agreed in general with the Court's decisions rallied to the support of the beleaguered judicial officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the months preceding this nonpartisan election, the three embattled justices were forced to appear on television to plead their cases, and to seek the endorsements of powerful newspapers, bar organizations, and prominent lawyers.  Most important, however, the justices were compelled to seek large amounts of money from potential campaign contributors so that they could convey their messages to the voters.  True, they could have kept silent--but if the people of the state want elections for judges, they must also want a fair and full debate on the issues;  and a fair and full statewide debate these days costs many millions--at least if, as was the fact in the 1986 California election, the opponents of incumbent judges conduct a full-scale, paid media campaign with thirty-second spots designed to inflame the passions and prejudices of the voters.  Statistics from other states suggest that California's experience in the 1986 race was not unique.  Seven million dollars was spent in Ohio's nonpartisan elections for the state Supreme Court that same year.  Even back in 1980, three open seats on the Texas Supreme Court generated campaign expenses of nearly two million dollars.  Uelman, California Judicial Retention Elections, 28 Santa Clara L.Rev. 333, 348 n. 44 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Money is no less important in the case of California's trial-court judges;  a survey conducted by the California Judges' Association is informative in this connection.  One judge who responded to the survey wrote, \"[M]y 'reasons for winning' ... are as follows:  (1) Money;  (2) Organization;  (3) An early start;  (4) Money;  (5) An 'excellent' candidate;  (6) A weak opponent;  (7) Excellent public relations and use of media advice;  (8) Money;  (9) Luck.\"    Schotland, Elective Judges' Campaign Financing:  Are State Judges' Robes the Emperor's Clothes of American Democracy?    2 J.L. &amp; Pol. 57, 155 (1985) (emphasis in original).  This dependence on contributors may actually affect a trial-court judge more significantly than an appellate judge, since a large portion of the necessary money is contributed by lawyers who may then or later (or indeed, regularly) have cases pending in the candidate's court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the above, the California provision prohibiting endorsements by political parties appears to be a particularly peculiar way of addressing the problem of maintaining judicial independence.  Obviously, the dependence of judges on campaign contributions represents a far greater threat to the integrity of California's judiciary than does the possibility that some judicial candidates may be endorsed by political party organizations.  Yet the state has not regulated the solicitation of campaign funds by incumbent or would-be judges, even though, as Chief Judge Goodwin points out in the majority opinion, the financial influences condoned by the state of California are not entitled to as much protection under the Constitution as the core political expression the state seeks to suppress.

Endorsements permit the judge to get his name before the public in a favorable light at no expense to himself.  Shutting off that avenue may well require him to find other means of attempting to make his name a household word in a few short months.  Almost all those other means will involve the expenditure of substantial amounts of money.  For example, a judge may file a candidate's statement which will be mailed to the voters by the county along with other election material, such as the statewide and local ballot arguments.  The rub is that the judge must pay the cost of the mailing, Cal.Elec.Code Sec. 10012, a cost well beyond the means of most judicial officers.  In the most recent election in Los Angeles County, the cost--to a candidate for the position of Superior Court judge--of distributing a biographical statement to the voters was over $62,000, and that cost was approximately fifteen percent higher than the cost at the time of the previous election only two years earlier.  Campaign costs for all means of communication have escalated comparably--and rapidly--and the need for judges and would-be judges to engage in serious fund raising activities continues to grow each year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if it were constitutionally permissible to ban some forms of speech in judicial campaigns, there is no warrant for singling out political endorsements.  In part, this is because the political parties have as much right to make known their views regarding candidates for judicial office as do the Crime Victims for Court Reform, the Law and Order Campaign Committee, the District Attorneys' Association of California, the National Organization for Women, or the San Francisco Chronicle, all of which took official positions in California's 1986 retention election.  The fact is that suppressing the views of political parties leaves the field free to special interest groups that have narrow, often single-issue agendas they wish to advance through the courts.  California's endorsement ban permits those groups to promote their chosen candidates without fear of countervailing messages from broader-based political parties which tend to take a more balanced view, and which consider candidates' overall records, qualifications, and judicial philosophy.  And California's choice must seem particularly irrational to anyone familiar with the regrettable propensity of those who manage judicial campaigns to pander to the voters' lack of familiarity with the processes of the law, and particularly the criminal law.  Again, California's experience in 1986 provides a telling example:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[I]magine the power of the 30-second television spot:  here was a stomach-turning crime, committed by a person whose humanity was cloaked in blood;  here is the mother, or the grandmother, or the daughter of the victim lamenting her loss, and suggesting, or implying, that the California Supreme Court, in its unalterable opposition to the death penalty, and in defiance of the public will, had in reliance upon some unidentified technicality set the defendant loose on the streets.  Of course, it was no technicality, but a matter of constitutional or statutory right, and of course the defendant was not turned loose, but returned for retrial--in fact by the time the opposition ran the principal ad I have described, the defendant in the case had already been retried, reconvicted, and sentenced to death.  But try explaining all of that effectively in 30 seconds on television, or in any manner sufficient to offset the emotional impact of the opponents' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grodin, supra note 7, at 366-67.  See also Forum, The Robed Politician, L.A. Law., Mar. 1979, at 12.  Given that many of the arguments befouling today's judicial campaigns are harmful to the health of the state judiciary, there is little reason to single out political endorsements, which are surely a cut above much that currently passes for \"debate on public issues [that is] uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\"    New York Times Co. v.

First, to the extent that one is concerned about the use of \"litmus tests\" for judicial candidates, the concern is misdirected.  As I have already suggested, party organizations are far less likely to use \"single-issue\" determinants of judicial fitness than are many powerful interest groups that participate in election campaigns, such as the National Rifle Association, the National Abortion Rights Action League, or the Right to Life Committee.  Silencing the voice of political parties serves only to increase the strength of the message being delivered by other groups with narrower or less public-spirited objectives.  Under these circumstances, it could well be argued that Judge Alarcon's \"frightened incumbent who has been subjected to media criticism for an unpopular decision,\" post, at 313, should welcome the broader perspective the political parties offer and the support their endorsements can bring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if the concern is rather that endorsements will be made on the basis of political allegiances that have nothing to do with judicial fitness, that is not an appropriate consideration on which to base a measure outlawing speech.  Voters are free to accept or reject endorsements made on the basis of political beliefs, just as they are free to base their ultimate choice on their own view of the judicial candidates's political or judicial philosophy.  Moreover, it is obvious that the \"slate mailers\" that frequently substitute for authentic endorsements have even less relation to the character or ability of the candidate.  Today's judicial elections, for the trial courts at least, are marked by the widespread use of pseudo-official mailers that contain endorsements of candidates for both partisan and nonpartisan office.  Republican candidates for partisan office are listed on slates addressed to Republican voters;  Democratic slates contain the names of Democratic candidates and are mailed to Democratic party members.  In each case, the names of the \"endorsed\" judicial candidates are listed as well.  However, the decision as to which candidates will appear on the slate mailers is made not in a democratic manner by the members or officers of an official party organization;  instead, it is made by private entrepreneurs, some of whom sell space--that is, endorsements--to the highest bidder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   Many of these private slate mailers, despite small print disclaimers, use the name of a political party and appear to the average voter to contain official party endorsements.  If political parties were to be prohibited from making endorsements in judicial campaigns, then judicial candidates who might otherwise seek an honest endorsement from a legitimate political party might be compelled to buy spurious party endorsements--to pay thousands of dollars to be included on slate mailers sent out by private operators who may have no convictions about anything.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>   Thus, even if party endorsements are made in substantial part on the basis of political affiliations, those affiliations are likely to tell the voters more about a candidate's judicial philosophy than would the fact that he can afford to purchase a spot on one or more pseudo-official slates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State of California cannot have it both ways.  If it wants to elect its judges, it cannot deprive its citizens of a full and robust election debate.  It cannot forbid speech by persons or groups who wish to make their views, support, or endorsements known.  Nor can it complain if the citizens wish to make their electoral judgments based in part on recommendations made by political parties.  If the people are to be given the right to choose their judges directly, they are free, rightly or wrongly, to consider the political philosophy of the candidates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>   They are even free, rightly or wrongly, to consider how the candidates may vote on important issues of public concern, such as abortion, capital punishment, affirmative action, gun control, and religious freedom, to name just a few.  One would have to be exceedingly naive not to be aware that a judge's judicial philosophy may influence his or her votes on important public issues that come before the court, particularly the state or federal supreme court.  Whether a judicial candidate wishes to make his views known on those issues during the electoral process is another matter.  So is the question whether it is proper for him to do so.  But those are all problems inherent in California's decision to conduct judicial elections.  If California wishes to elect its judges, it must allow free speech to prevail in the election process.  While it is undoubtedly clear to all that California could not prohibit all endorsements in judicial elections, in this case it is equally clear that it cannot single out one form of disfavored speech and ban it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the citizens of California have a choice.  If they want their judges to be free from the need to conduct full-scale political campaigns, to solicit campaign funds, to seek endorsements from political organizations and private-interest pressure groups, and, most important of all, to be free from the need to worry about whether their decisions in pending cases will affect their chances of reelection, there are options available.  California could, like the federal government, provide for the appointment of judges for life--at some or all levels of its judiciary.  Or, there are other alternatives, some more in keeping with the traditional approach of most states.  For example, California could provide that its judges must be elected or confirmed once, and that thereafter they would not need to stand for office again.  However, it is not my function to tell California what system it should use to select its judges.  There are legitimate arguments both for and against judicial elections;  and various factors to be balanced--the most important being accountability, on the one hand, versus independence, on the other.  In the end, however, any system must be judged in large measure by the quality of the judges it produces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system presently used in California has both advantages and disadvantages, as does the federal system.  However, one thing is clear:  Whatever California's ultimate decision, it may not call an election, judicial or nonjudicial, and silence citizens who wish to speak, individually or collectively, through a political party organization or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RYMER, Circuit Judge, with whom ALARCON and FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that political speech is at the core of the First Amendment, and is to be jealously protected.

Cal. Const. art.  II, Sec. 6(a);  Cal.Elec.Code Sec. 37.  No one contests the constitutionality of this structure.  Implementing it, the Legislature has enacted a number of statutes that insulate nonpartisan elections from the party apparatus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fn2-2_ref\">2</a>   When the California Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that existing law did not clearly prevent political parties from endorsing and supporting candidates for nonpartisan office,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-2\" id=\"fn3-2_ref\">3</a> the people adopted a constitutional amendment to make clear their intent that no political party or party central committee should endorse, support or oppose a candidate for nonpartisan office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question in this case is whether California has a compelling interest in the structure of its nonpartisan government, such that prohibiting political party endorsements, opposition and support of candidates for nonpartisan office is the least restrictive means by which it can be achieved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a>   The answer, I submit, requires us to consider the unique nature of this interest in our federal system, and to constrain ourselves in the interests of comity to interpret Sec. 6(b) so as to avoid unconstitutionality, if possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California's interest in this case is of extraordinary importance.  It is rooted in the United States Constitution, which assures the citizens of each state the right to determine the structure of their own government so long as it is in a republican form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a>   Because of its constitutional underpinning, the state's interest in this case is particularly compelling.  Such an interest requires a different balancing of the burdens on plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the state's justification for the burdens imposed, and the restrictiveness of the means available to accomplish the goal of preserving the nonpartisan structure of government by keeping nonpartisan offices and nonpartisan elections, nonpartisan, than either the district court or the majority has undertaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not surprising that the state's interest in the structure of its government has not been taken into account, because the City argued a different interest (avoiding corruption) in its papers.

The purpose of a primary election within this structure is to settle the differences within the party, so that the majority views of the party members are carried forward to the general election.  The partisan primary election is designed to ensure that party nominations are within party lines, thus preserving the integrity of the party.

Much as I respect Judge Zirpoli, I do not think the result in this case is self-evident.  If, however, my only option were to decide what is self-evident, I would say that nonpartisan means no party and there is accordingly no less restrictive means of filling a no-party office, than a no party election.  But I believe reasonable judges can reasonably differ on a sensitive issue such as this.  It is therefore unsatisfactory that we should indulge our own instincts or experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a framework within which an objective analysis could be conducted that would be commensurate with the importance of this case.  A logical starting point is how the Legislature has filled out the skeleton of the state's nonpartisan structure for judicial, school and municipal government.  A \"partisan office\" means \"an office for which a party may nominate a candidate,\" while a nonpartisan office is one whose holders have not been nominated in a partisan primary or identified on the ballot as affiliated with a political party, and who have not been elected on a partisan ballot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>   In 1986 the people of the state amended Section 6 of the California Constitution to reaffirm that \"[a]ll judicial, school, county, and city offices shall be nonpartisan\" (Sec. 6(a)) and to provide that \"[n]o political party<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> or party central committee may endorse, support, or oppose a candidate for nonpartisan office\" (Sec. 6(b)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> This was done to continue a \"long-understood ban on partisan electioneering in local and judicial elections\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> which the California Supreme Court had concluded was not enforceable under the Constitution or statutes as then drafted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, it makes sense to assess the burden Sec. 6(b) imposes on political parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   It does not prevent individuals or groups of individuals (such as the California Democratic Council or \"Democrats for Bradley\") from making endorsements.  Nor does it preclude political parties from speaking out on issues.  For example, the Republican Party could support the building of a jail in Fresno and the Democratic Party could oppose it, even though candidate A for mayor was for the building of the jail and candidate B was against it.  Narrowly construed, Sec. 6(b) does not inhibit a political party from calling attention to a candidate's record and experience and qualifications.  Further, the identification of candidates with particular parties plays much less of a role in the nurturing of an informed electorate for local, school and judicial offices, than for national (or state) elections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>   To the extent that the natural focus of a ballot-qualified party is on issues of broad application and on partisan offices such as the Presidency, the Congress, or the Governorship, party labels provide scarcely any \"shorthand designation of the views of party candidates on matters of public concern\" in connection with nonpartisan, specialized local elections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>   This is especially so since candidates for nonpartisan office neither run as a party member, nor are labelled as such on the ballot.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factors should then be considered in light of the \"super\"-compelling importance of the state's interest in its chosen form of government, to determine if Sec. 6(b) is narrowly tailored, whether there are less restrictive means that serve that interest, and whether alternatives work.  The majority concludes that \"the mere fact that Sec. 6(b) targets the collective rather than the individual voices of party members does not suffice to render it 'precisely drawn.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>   I agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>   But the fact that it targets the collective voice only with respect to endorsements for nonpartisan offices may render it drawn as precisely as it can be,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> for to preclude party endorsements in nonparty elections is the flip side of a candidate's running for nonpartisan office without party identification.  It also conforms exactly to the California Election Code's definition of partisan office as one \"for which a party may nominate a candidate,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> and conversely to that of a nonpartisan office, for which a party may not nominate a candidate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"less drastic\" possibilities posited by the district court (and adopted by the majority) may be links in the chain, but cannot serve the state's structural interest if there is any missing link.  For example, Judge Zirpoli suggested that nonpartisan methods of nomination would be less restrictive.  Clearly these serve the applicable interest.  However, if nonpartisan methods of nomination were not supplemented by prohibiting party endorsements, the track to nonpartisan office would be virtually indistinguishable from the track to partisan office.  Candidates are nominated for nonpartisan office by petition which may not disclose their party affiliation;  those for partisan offices are nominated through partisan primaries.  There would thus be no material difference between a nonpartisan method of nomination, with party endorsements as Judge Zirpoli suggests, and a partisan method of election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>   Therefore it does not appear that the means of relying entirely on nonpartisan nomination methods, without the limitation in Sec. 6(b), would work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>   The district court's other suggestion, prohibiting candidates from soliciting or collecting campaign funds from political parties, might serve the state's interest in corruption, but would only incidentally advance its interest in structure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court was considering corruption, it measured neither alternative against a structural interest that is \"super\"-compelling.  While these or other means might work, there is no basis in the record for reaching a reasoned conclusion that they will or won't.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the final step in the analysis ought to be whether the state's interest in the nonpartisan structure of government, constitutionally recognized in the guarantee clause, warrants a burden of the sort imposed on the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of a political party.  Both the Congress and the Supreme Court have acknowledged that there is a difference of constitutional dimension between political activity by political parties and political activities of other organizations or individual political actors.

The same goes for the rights of a political party to espouse views on controversial issues, even when those views correspond to views held by a particular candidate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was clear to the Court in Letter Carriers that the danger to proper government functioning presented by political party involvement was different in kind from the danger presented by the involvement of other organizations, ideas, considerations, or even by political actors of an independent stripe.  In other words, in the political context nonpartisanship does not mean that an officeholder adheres to no causes or factions, or even that the officeholder is not committed to the tenets or goals of a political party.  It does mean that there should not be activity that gives (or seems to give) a party any power whatever over the holder of a nonpartisan office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, there is no reason inhering in the state's interest in the structure of its government that inhibits California from justifying its restriction on endorsements in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the state's interest in the structure of nonpartisan government is so compelling, I do not believe it is necessary to reach the corruption issue.

See, e.g., Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 565, 93 S.Ct. at 2890 (partisan political activities by government employees poses danger to \"fair and effective government\");  Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 788 n. 26, 98 S.Ct. at 1422 n. 26 (importance of government interest in preventing corruption of elected representatives through creation of political debts \"has never been doubted\");  Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. at 638.    Letter Carriers is closely on point, implicitly recognizing that partisan politics may have a corrupting influence on a system designed to be nonpartisan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>   The interest California actually asserted in this case is not that endorsement by a political party corrupts the voter by influencing him or her to cast a ballot one way or the other;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  rather, it is that endorsement corrupts the nonpartisan candidate and officeholder in the performance of his duties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>   Along with the state's interest in preventing corruption of that sort, \"[p]reservation of the individual citizen's confidence in government is equally important.\"   Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 789, 98 S.Ct. at 1422.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a limitation on speech does keep information from the voters, Buckley teaches that it is permissible if there is a compelling state interest balanced against a marginal burden on First Amendment rights.  Applying Buckley to Sec. 6(b) suggests that endorsements are more analogous to large campaign contributions than to independent expenditures;  unlike independent campaign expenditures, endorsements are prearranged and coordinated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>   Unlike a contribution, however, endorsement itself creates the corruption, not the amount of endorsement.  The state therefore has a justification for banning endorsements that neither the district court nor the majority recognizes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also relies on Austin in concluding that the kind of corruption at issue here is different from that reached elsewhere.  While the relevance of Austin to this case is by no means clear, it is not unambiguous.  However tempting it may be to whitewash its holding or pick and choose what it says, the Court can fairly be read to suggest that the state's interest in avoiding corruption is reasonably furthered by restricting speech, in the form of expenditures, by organizations which have amassed political \"war chests\" with the aid of legal advantages conferred by the state.  As ballot-qualified parties have that status by virtue of statute in California, it could be said that they, too, have amassed their clout with the aid of legal advantages conferred by the state such that, in the context of a nonpartisan election, their \"war chest\" would have a correspondingly corrosive effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have an obligation to construe any law, if fairly possible, to avoid raising doubts of its constitutionality.

Unger II, 37 Cal.3d at 620, 692 P.2d at 243, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 479.    Justice Mosk, however, did not purport to discuss the propriety or wisdom of a law that would bar endorsements on nonpartisan elections:  \"Our conclusion in this case is reached without consideration of policy questions.  We are not unmindful of the persuasive reasons why it is preferable for political parties to refrain from endorsing or opposing nonpartisan candidates.    However, that is a matter for consideration by the Legislature;  it, not the judiciary, is the proper body to impose regulations in the conduct of political parties.\"    Id., 692 P.2d at 243-44, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 479-80 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Malcolm Lucas filed a concurring opinion in which he stated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur, albeit reluctantly, in the majority opinion.  My agreement stems from my conclusion that Justice Mosk has correctly interpreted the scope of the existing restrictions imposed by the Legislature and the California Constitution.  My reluctance flows from my concern about the effect of our ruling in light of important social and political policy considerations expressed by Justice Sims in his dissent.  I think there is a strong state interest in preserving the nonpartisan nature of the offices involved and that this interest will be sorely tried if political parties engage in wholesale endorsement of and opposition to candidates for \"judicial, school, county, and city offices ....\"  (Cal.

His conclusion that the First Amendment may well bar restrictions on political endorsements of candidates for nonpartisan office is premature.  The Legislature may be able to fashion a permissible limitation on partisan involvement in nonpartisan campaigns after careful scrutiny of the various interests at stake.

Justice Sims, joined by Justice Potter, expressed the view that \"the state, in pursuit of the laudable aim of freeing judicial offices from partisan consideration has properly served a compelling interest by limiting the elections in which the statutorily created party may officially participate.\"    Id. at 626, 692 P.2d at 247, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 483 (Sims, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the majority opinion and the observations of Justices Lucas and Sims that six members of the seven-person panel were of the view that there are \"persuasive reasons why it is preferable for political parties to refrain from endorsing or opposing nonpartisan candidates.\"    Unger II, 37 Cal.3d at 620, 692 P.2d at 243-44, 209 Cal.Rptr. at 479-80.

California voters adopted subsection (b) by a vote of 2,292,678 to 1,805,305 on June 3, 1986.  Thus, the reformation of California law to protect the independence of the judiciary and remove local offices from the control of political parties, which began in 1911, was completed 75 years later.  In 1986, a majority of Californians approved an initiative that expressly spelled out that the political reforms inspired by Hiram Johnson's populist political revolution cannot be fulfilled if party endorsement or opposition of nonpartisan candidates for judicial and local office is tolerated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-3\" id=\"fn3-3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY:</p>\n    <p>A COMPELLING CALIFORNIA IMPERATIVE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California's determination to eliminate political party domination of judicial and local office holders because of its sad experiences with the impact of party influence on the integrity and independence of elected officials led inexorably to the adoption of subsection (b).

This sordid record inspired the populist revolution against the corrupt domination by political parties over the daily lives of California's citizens.  I believe that California's voters have applied inspired logic to eliminate the evils brought about by party control of judicial and local office elections, by enacting legislation to make these offices nonpartisan.  I agree with my colleagues that subsection (b) places a burden on first amendment rights requiring strict scrutiny to determine whether the state has demonstrated that this restriction on protected activity is supported by a compelling state interest.

None of the cases cited by the majority, however, analyzes the question whether a state may burden first amendment rights by precluding party endorsements in nonpartisan elections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the record amply demonstrates that subsection (b) is necessary to meet California's compelling interest in maintaining the independence of the judiciary.  Regrettably, the majority makes no reference to the compelling and uncontradicted testimony presented to the district court by former Associate Justice Winslow Christian.  Justice Christian clearly qualifies as an expert on the potentially devastating impact of politics on judicial independence in California.  Justice Christian served as a trial judge in Sierra County for four years.  He was an associate justice of the California Courts of Appeal for 17 years.  He was also the Executive Director of the National Center for State Courts for several years.  Justice Christian testified that this position enabled him to study the judicial selection and tenure systems in many states.  He also \"learned that in certain states partisanship in judicial elections has damaged the reputation of the judiciary.\"    Justice Christian declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p>[ ] The state of California has a compelling interest in the independence and integrity of its judiciary.

Permitting partisanship in the process of nominating, selecting and retaining judges would force judges to seek party endorsements.  This process would create a risk of judicial candidates being tempted to promise to take party positions on legal issues which are pending or likely to arise.  This harmful feature of partisanship in judicial elections has damaged the reputation of the judicial systems of certain other states known to me.  The mere possibility of such political \"deals\" would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p>[ ] Endorsements of judicial candidates by political parties differs from endorsements by other groups or individuals because political party endorsements tend to call for commitments on political and social issues conflicting with the overriding commitment a judge should hold to ... fair and unbiased administration of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p>[ ] In my opinion, therefore, partisan endorsements in nonpartisan judicial elections undermine the state's compelling interest in the independence and integrity of its judiciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By voicing his concern that a political party would expect a judicial candidate to adopt its platform on controversial issues that are likely to come before the court, Justice Christian sharply focuses on the clearest threat to the independence of the judiciary presented by permitting political parties to endorse or oppose a candidate for a nonpartisan office.  As illustrated by the letter sent to candidates for a nonpartisan office in Unger I, 102 Cal.App.3d at 683, 162 Cal.Rptr. at 612, political parties are interested in learning whether those persons soliciting their endorsement and financial support are loyal and registered members of their political organizations and whether they hold views that are faithful to their platforms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1990 California Democratic Party platform contains the following positions on issues important to that political group:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p>The Agricultural Labor Board, which held such promise for often exploited farm workers, has suffered from appointees and policies hostile to the interests of farm workers....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p>There should be an immediate halt to off-shore oil development....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p>We call for a halt to the production, use, and development of nuclear power until safe methods of mining, transport, and disposal of nuclear waste are available....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p>We must eliminate the use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals found to be harmful to humans, the environment or food production....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p>Students with limited English proficiency must have every opportunity to learn English through strong bilingual education....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p>Race has been found to influence the likelihood that a person charged with capital murder will receive the death sentence, with minorities more likely to face execution and longer sentences....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p>The California Democratic Party believes that reproductive freedom of choice is every woman's fundamental right and that such a decision is private....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p>We pledge to actively oppose efforts to further erode the application of the 1973 Roe v.

Dissenting in Unger, Justice Sims, sitting by designation, discounted the frequency of such partisan activity by stating that it occurred in only 25 percent of the state's counties.  His use of statistics, however, was highly misleading.  In the study on which Justice Sims relied, Professor Lee noted that the tendency of political parties to participate in nonpartisan elections increased with the population.  According to Professor Lee's study, if the counties without significant populations are excluded, the political parties made endorsements in nonpartisan elections in roughly two-thirds of the state's counties.

Governor George Deukmejian served as a vigorous public spokesman for the forces seeking to oust the incumbent Supreme Court justices in the 1986 election.  When his view prevailed, he was able to appoint successors whose positions on controversial issues more closely matched his own</p>\n        <p>Since our concern here is not with the electoral debate per se, but rather with the effect on the post-election performance of public duties, it is interesting to note that some of Governor Deukmejian's remarks in the 1986 campaign were explicitly directed toward the \"correction\" of what the Governor perceived as errant judicial conduct by sitting justices.  Governor Deukmejian initially opposed only Chief Justice Rose Bird, and not Associate Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph Grodin.  Toward the middle of the campaign, however, as former Justice Grodin tells us, the Governor</p>\n        <p>declared that he would be inclined also to vote against Justice Reynoso and myself if our records in death penalty cases did not improve.  Still later, in the early fall preceding the election, he announced that he did, indeed, intend to vote against the two of us as well, citing as justification that Justice Reynoso had voted only once to affirm a death penalty judgment and on only five occasions had I done so.  There was no analysis of the cases, no argument that the grounds on which we had voted to reverse death penalty judgments were legally insubstantial, and no indication of how many death penalty judgments we would have to affirm to meet with Governor Deukmejian's approval.</p>\n        <p>Grodin, supra note 7, at 367.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> It is only natural, of course, for members of the bar to join the fray on both sides, for no one is more interested than lawyers in the question of who will decide controversial cases.  Indeed, lawyers constitute the largest single group of contributors to judicial campaigns generally.  The excessive judicial reliance on attorney contributions can raise troubling questions about the even-handedness of justice.  See generally Note, Safeguarding the Litigant's Constitutional Right to a Fair and Impartial Forum, 86 Mich.L.Rev. 382 (1987).  At least as disturbing is the role played by law enforcement organizations.  Statistics from 1980 show that such organizations are at the top of the list in terms of average contributions.

For some offices, the slate-mailer operator may choose candidates affiliated with his faction of the party;  in other cases, the highest bidder may prevail.  In the general election, the factors are different.  The party's nominees for partisan office are included automatically and only endorsements of judges and other nonpartisan candidates, as well as endorsements of ballot measures are up for grabs.  It is in fact the supporters or opponents of the latter who principally finance slate mailers.

Whether there was any involvement in judicial elections even in those counties is unclear.</p>\n        <p>Regardless, it is incorrect to infer from Lee, as the majority appears to do, that political parties endorsed candidates for nonpartisan office in 25% of the counties prior to 1986.  Majority opn., supra, at 282 (\"Nevertheless, because the legal status of such endorsements was unclear, political parties did not endorse candidates in 75% of California counties\").  Table 32, from which that statistic is drawn, concerns \"public or openly visible activity,\" not endorsements.  Table 33, which shows the type of political activity reported on the survey, indicates that public endorsement of candidates occurred in 4 counties (about 10%)--although there is no way of telling from the survey whether the occurrence was singular, sporadic or repetitive.</p>\n        <p>Referring to the Lee survey, or relying on it to suppose that party endorsements caused no harm to the nonpartisan structure before Sec. 6(b) was adopted in 1986, illustrates why it is risky to make decisions based on assumptions without an evidentiary basis.

While the restrictions embodied in Sec. 6(b) implicate both First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, Eu, 109 S.Ct. at 1020, the magnitude of the injury has to be measured against both the strength of the interest, and the alternatives available.

The only difference would be that in the case of the nonpartisan track, the decision about which candidate would carry the party banner would be made by the party, not by the people as is their prerogative in the partisan track.  The irony is, this would allow political parties even greater power in the nonpartisan track than in the partisan.  That not only runs counter to what the voters intended when they amended Section 6 of the California Constitution, but would effectively destroy the nonpartisan system--and that runs counter to the intent of Article IV, Sec. 4 of the United States Constitution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> That certainly was the judgment of supporters of the amendment to Section 6.  See, e.g., an editorial in The Sacramento Bee, To Protect Non-Partisan Elections, which opined that \"[t]he principal danger is that the decision [Unger ] opens the way ... to school boards whose members make curricular decisions according to the political orientation of the parties that support them and, worse, look toward advancement by the party as a reward for faithful service in 'non-partisan' positions.\"    August 13, 1985, at B6, col. 1 (final ed.)  (editorial), quoted in 87 Colum.L.Rev. at 1681.

The former relates primarily to the state's interest in corruption but would turn its interest in structure on its head;  the latter would too, in that presumably those administrative personnel would be appointed by persons elected in partisan elections.  Neither means comports with a nonpartisan structure, and that is a choice both the guarantee clause and the Tenth Amendment leave for the people to make</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> The state could not, for example, justify a ban on endorsements by special interest groups on the ground that government should be \"non-special interest.\"    The state's interest in the structure of government goes to such things as whether it is to be partisan or nonpartisan, town meeting or city council, appointive or elective;  the state could not rely on an interest stemming from the guarantee clause to justify a government based on religious beliefs or race or ideas.  Such things have nothing to do with structure</p>\n        <p>By the same token, if the state's asserted interest is corruption, its justification for banning endorsements by political parties is weakened because the corrupting effect of endorsements or support by a special interest group may be essentially the same.  However, clout of a special interest group has no relevance to the state's interest in the structure of government.    Special interest groups have no access to the ballot and their membership may cut across party lines.  Their raison d'etre is to influence voters and officeholders issue by issue, sometimes in accord with the views of a political party, sometimes not.  They are quintessentially non-party organizations.  By contrast, political parties have ballot access, are comprised of persons of the same political persuasion, and exist to win elections and run governments.  See Moore v.

In upholding limitations on union and corporate campaign activity, the Supreme Court stated that the \"differing structures and purposes\" of entities \"may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process.\"    The Court further distinguished restrictions placed on individuals and unincorporated associations, on the one hand, and unions and corporations on the other</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn39\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39_ref\">39</a>\n        <p> Majority opn., supra, at 285</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn40\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40_ref\">40</a>\n        <p> To eliminate the ban on opposition and support would also decrease the appearance of prearrangement and coordination that Buckley found to be indicators of corruption.  To the same extent, the risk of a direct quid pro quo is lessened.  Limiting Sec. 6(b) to endorsements would also obviate the problem of how to enforce a restraint on \"opposing\" or \"supporting\" on the margin, for instance, whether Republican Party opposition to Mayor Bradley's campaign for Governor (a partisan office) would violate its obligation not to \"oppose\" him in his capacity as a candidate for, or officeholder of, the mayoralty (a nonpartisan office)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn41\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41_ref\">41</a>\n        <p> The case comes to us in a curious posture.  Relating to the issues presented in this case and in connection with the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs produced the affidavits of Arlo Hale Smith and Terence Falkner.  These declarations went to standing, not to substantive issues.  The city presented no evidence in opposition.  Subsequently, the City submitted several declarations in connection with its motion to vacate, as did plaintiffs in opposition.  In denying the motion to vacate, the district judge indicated that he had reviewed the motion but was not persuaded to change his decision.  In that sense, the declarations are a part of the record.  However it is unclear that they form any part of the basis of the district's order granting partial summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn42\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42_ref\">42</a>\n        <p> See Mandel v.

Judge Gitelson sought reelection in 1970.  Attorney William P. Kennedy ran against Judge Gitelson and forced him into a runoff election.  The day after the primary election, Mr. Kennedy summarized his campaign in the following press statement:</p>\n        <p>My objection to the judge is based primarily on his decision requiring school integration by forced bussing....

If a party adopted Mr. Kennedy's point of view, either out of conviction or simply because he is a loyal member, it would be entitled to endorse him and ask the voters to vote \"no\" on bussing.  By the same token, another party would be free to support Judge Gitelson, regardless of his views or qualifications, to avoid losing that office to a candidate who was registered with a rival political organization.  The people of California have wisely chosen to preclude the injection of state central committee partisan concerns and \"priorities\" in elections dealing with local problems that require nonpartisan solutions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-3_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> I will bind myself to your service in this world,</p>\n        <p>To be at your beck and never rest nor slack;</p>\n        <p>When we meet again on the other side,</p>\n        <p>In the same coin you shall pay me back.</p>\n        <p>Goethe's Faust 58 (L.
