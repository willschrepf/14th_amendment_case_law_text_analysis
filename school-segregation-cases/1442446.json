Bell                                         Page 2\n\n\nto the court’s 2001 denial of his original habeas petition as well as the court’s 2008\ndenial of his amended petition based on Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002). For the\nreasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Black’s habeas\npetition regarding his non-Atkins claims, VACATE the court’s judgment regarding his\nAtkins claim, and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Black was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for the killing of his\ngirlfriend Angela Clay and her two minor daughters, Latoya, age nine, and Lakeisha, age\nsix. He was also convicted on one count of burglary arising out of the same incident.\nBlack received a death sentence for the murder of Lakeisha, consecutive life sentences\nfor the other two murders, and fifteen years of imprisonment for the burglary.\n\nA.     Factual background\n\n       Black was born on March 23, 1956. He was 33 years old when the murders were\ncommitted in 1988. The Tennessee Supreme Court, in deciding Black’s claims on direct\nappeal, summarized the facts of this case, in part, as follows:\n\n               It appears that these bizarre and tragic murders occurred in the\n       early morning hours of Monday, March 28, 1988. The bodies of the\n       three victims were found Monday evening around 9:30 p.m. At the time\n       of the murders, the Defendant was on [a] weekend furlough from the\n       Metropolitan Workhouse in Davidson County. . . .\n                The Defendant was the boyfriend of Angela Clay, who had\n       separated from her husband, Bennie Clay, about a year before her death.\n       Bennie Clay was the father of Latoya and Lakeisha. Bennie Clay\n       testified that at the time of Angela Clay’s death, he and Angela were\n       attempting to reconcile, but the Defendant was an obstacle to the\n       reconciliation. He further testified that Angela began a relationship with\n       the Defendant after their separation and that at times she was seeing both\n       the Defendant and himself. In December, 1986, the Defendant and\n       Bennie Clay had an altercation during a dispute over Angela. . . . The\n       Defendant pled guilty to the shooting [of Bennie Clay] and received the\n       workhouse sentence, which included weekend furloughs.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                         Page 3\n\n\nState v. Black, 815 S.W.2d 166, 170-71 (Tenn. 1991).\n\n       On the night of the murders, Black drove the victims to the home of Angela’s\nmother. Angela and her two daughters were last seen that evening by her mother at\naround 11 p.m. Angela’s mother testified that Angela telephoned her at approximately\n11:20 p.m. that evening after Angela returned home. That phone call was the last time\nthat any of the witnesses spoke to Angela before her death. The police arrived at\nAngela’s apartment at approximately 9:30 p.m. the following night. They did not find\nany signs of forced entry into the apartment, but they found a pool of blood on the bed\nand the body of a small child on the floor. Id. The Tennessee Supreme Court continued\nits summary of the relevant facts, citing the testimony of Dr. Charles Harlan, Chief\nMedical Examiner for Davidson County:\n\n              Investigation revealed the bodies of Angela and her nine year old\n       daughter, Latoya, in the master bedroom. Angela, who was lying in the\n       bed, had apparently been shot once in the top of the head as she slept and\n       was rendered unconscious immediately and died within minutes. . . .\n              Latoya’s body was found partially on the bed and partially off the\n       bed, wedged between the bed and a chest of drawers. She had been shot\n       once through the neck and chest. . . .\n               The body of Lakeisha, age six, was found in the second bedroom\n       lying facedown on the floor next to her bed. She had been shot twice,\n       once in the chest, once in the pelvic area. . . .\n              The receiver from the kitchen telephone was found in the master\n       bedroom. The telephone from the master bedroom was lying in the\n       hallway between the two bedrooms. The Defendant’s fingerprints were\n       the only prints recovered from the telephones. Two of his fingerprints\n       were found on the phone in the hallway, and one was on the kitchen\n       telephone receiver found in the master bedroom.\n\nId. at 171-72. A substantial amount of additional circumstantial evidence connected\nBlack to the killings. Id. at 172-73.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                           Page 4\n\n\nB.      Procedural history\n\n        In 1991, the Tennessee Supreme Court denied Black’s numerous claims on his\ndirect appeal. Black then filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the Davidson\nCounty Criminal Court. The trial court denied the petition after an evidentiary hearing,\nand the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) affirmed. Black’s petition to\nappeal the denial of his post-conviction claims to the Tennessee Supreme Court was\ndenied. The United States Supreme Court subsequently denied his petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n\n        Black then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, based\non 28 U.S.C. § 2254, seeking relief on a number of evidentiary, procedural, and\nsubstantive grounds relating to both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial, as well as\nto issues that arose in his various state-court appeals. The district court denied all 34 of\nBlack’s habeas claims, including several subclaims, in December 2001. Black v. Bell,\n181 F. Supp. 2d 832 (M.D. Tenn. 2001). It then issued Black a Certificate of\nAppealability (COA) for all of the claims that it decided on the merits and denied a COA\nregarding the claims that it dismissed as procedurally defaulted. Black timely appealed\nthe court’s decision.\n\n        After the Supreme Court decided Atkins in 2002, this court granted Black’s\nmotion to hold his case in abeyance so that Black could exhaust his Atkins claim in the\nstate courts. Black then filed a motion in 2002 to reopen his post-conviction proceedings\nin the state trial court. That court determined that Black had made a sufficient showing\nfor his case to be reopened based on his Atkins claim. It held an evidentiary hearing, but\nultimately determined that Black is not mentally retarded under the Atkins standard. The\nTCCA affirmed this decision in 2006, and the Tennessee Supreme Court denied Black’s\napplication for permission to appeal. The United States Supreme Court again denied\nBlack’s petition for a writ of certiorari. This court then remanded Black’s pending\nappeal of the district court’s denial of his § 2254 petition back to the district court so that\nit could reconsider Black’s mental-retardation claim (which was one of Black’s original\n34 claims that the district court denied) in light of Atkins.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644            Black v. Bell                                        Page 5\n\n\n        The district court did so in 2008, ultimately dismissing Black’s Atkins claim on\nthe basis that “the state court was not unreasonable in stating that the proof in the record\ndid not support the conclusion, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that\n[Black’s] I.Q. was below seventy before age 18.” It also dismissed Black’s additional\nclaim that the issue of his mental retardation should have been submitted to the jury,\nruling that the claim was beyond the scope of this court’s remand order, and also because\nthe claim failed on the merits. But the district court granted Black a COA on his Atkins\nclaim, and Black timely filed an appeal. We then granted Black’s motion to expand his\nCOA to include the issue of whether he had cause to excuse the procedural default of his\nclaim that the jury improperly weighed an unconstitutional felony-murder aggravating\ncircumstance. But we denied Black’s motion to have two additional issues included in\nhis COA.\n\n        Black’s appeal of the district court’s original dismissal of his habeas claims in\n2001 and his appeal of that court’s denial of his Atkins claim in 2008 have been\nconsolidated in the present appeal. We thus have before us the issues that are within his\nCOAs from both decisions. Although Black’s COAs cover many issues, he has limited\nhis appeal to a total of five.\n\n        In addition to Black’s Atkins claim, the other four district-court determinations\nthat Black now challenges are (1) whether he was competent to stand trial and whether\nhe was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on that issue, (2) whether his trial counsel was\nconstitutionally ineffective in failing to fully investigate, present, and argue mitigating\nfactors against the death penalty, (3) whether his trial counsel was constitutionally\nineffective in failing to object to the prosecution’s comment during closing argument at\nthe penalty phase of the trial that giving Black a life sentence for all three of the murders\nwould “reward” him, and (4) whether the trial court erred by declining to clarify for the\njury, upon its request, the effect of a life sentence.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                          Page 6\n\n\nC.      Atkins background\n\n        Under Tennessee law, capital defendants are considered mentally retarded if\n(1) they have “[s]ignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning as evidenced\nby a functional intelligence quotient (I.Q.) of seventy (70) or below; (2) [they have\nd]eficits in adaptive behavior; and (3) [t]he intellectual disability must have been\nmanifested during the developmental period, or by eighteen (18) years of age.” Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 39-13-203(a).\n\n        Each side presented conflicting evidence concerning whether Black qualifies as\nmentally retarded. At Black’s post-conviction proceedings on his Atkins claim, he\npresented four lay and three expert witnesses, the affidavit of another expert, and\nnumerous exhibits in support of his claim. The State presented two expert witnesses in\nopposition. In addition, the state court considered the testimony of numerous lay and\nexpert witnesses who testified during the course of Black’s pre-Atkins proceedings.\n\n        1.      Black’s numerical I.Q. scores\n\n        One major category of evidence dealt with Black’s numerical I.Q. scores. In its\npost-conviction opinion on Black’s Atkins claim, the TCCA observed that Black’s\nintelligence has been tested numerous times, from his grade-school years through 2001.\nBlack v. State, No. M2004-01345-CCA-R3-PD, 2005 WL 2662577, at *13 (Tenn. Ct.\nCrim. App. Oct. 19, 2005). These scores can be grouped into the following three\ncategories: (1) tests that were administered while Black was in elementary school, with\nthe scores ranging from 83 to 97; (2) tests that were taken in preparation for Black’s trial\nand during his first round of post-conviction proceedings, from 1988 to 1997, which\nranged from 73 to 76; and (3) tests that were administered in 2001 by Black’s experts\nwho testified at his Atkins hearing, which ranged from 57 to 69. In addition, Black took\nachievement tests in high school. Dr. Daniel Grant, a psychologist and one of Black’s\nexpert witnesses, explained that Black’s scores on the Differential Aptitude Test in the\nninth grade placed his level of intelligence in the mentally retarded range.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 7\n\n\n          A major point of contention in the present case, and an issue that the TCCA did\nnot resolve, is which set of scores most accurately reflects Black’s level of intelligence\nby the time he was 18 years of age. Although Black’s first set of I.Q. scores were taken\nduring this key period of his life and are above 70, his experts challenge the accuracy of\nthese scores based on the sparse information concerning the testing details as well as the\nquestionable supervision of Black’s academic progress at his segregated elementary\nschool.\n\n          Black’s I.Q. scores from 1988 through 1997 were also above 70, but Dr. Grant\nopined that, when adjusted for the “Flynn Effect” and/or the standard error of\nmeasurement (SEM) that applies to these tests, these scores should be considered 70 or\nbelow. As Dr. Grant explained, the Flynn Effect calls for adjusting downward the score\nthat a subject receives on an older I.Q. test based on the idea that the general\npopulation’s level of knowledge increases over time, thereby raising the average score\nobtained on older tests. Dr. Patti van Eys, a clinical psychologist who submitted an\naffidavit regarding her evaluation of Black, noted that the Flynn Effect is “broadly\naccepted by the psychological community and recognized by the American Association\non Mental Retardation (AAMR).”\n\n          On the other hand, State witness Dr. Susan Vaught, a clinical psychologist,\ntestified that although the Flynn Effect is a recognized issue that a clinician might\nconsider when interpreting an I.Q. test, she did not think that it should be used to adjust\nthe numerical score that a subject received on his or her test. She explained that “[y]ou\ndon’t apply a numerical correction to a score that you get based on the Flynn Effect. It’s\nnot in that kind of use amongst clinicians who test[].” Dr. Eric Engum, the other clinical\npsychologist for the State, also rejected the practice of correcting for the Flynn Effect\nbecause “[o]ne cannot arbitrarily . . . go back in time and ‘correct’ or ‘recalculate’ a\npreviously obtained IQ based on [subsequent] changes in standardization.”\n\n          As for the SEM, Dr. Grant testified that because the I.Q. score achieved on any\nparticular test is fallible, the scores generally involve a SEM of five points up or down\nfrom the given score. Dr. Vaught similarly stated in her report that it is “typical and\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644           Black v. Bell                                         Page 8\n\n\nexpected” under the prevailing standard of practice “to consider the [SEM] for any given\ntest in order to determine if a patient’s score could fall below 70.”\n\n          The experts also disagree about the relevance of Black’s 2001 I.Q. scores. Dr.\nVaught conceded that, based on these most recent I.Q. scores, Black “currently meets\nthe first criterion for mental retardation.” Black, 2005 WL 2662577, at *14. But she and\nDr. Engum were suspicious of the scores’ validity based on comparisons to other\nindications of Black’s level of intelligence. They suspected that Black was malingering\n(i.e., artificially deflating his scores) during these later tests. Black’s experts, on the\nother hand, specifically determined that he was not malingering, and they were highly\ncritical of the opinion of the State’s experts that Black was malingering based solely on\nthe written record, without having personally interviewed him.\n\n          Black’s experts determined that his I.Q. fell in the mentally retarded range by the\ntime he was age 18, but the State’s experts disagreed. Dr. Vaught, in particular, noted\nthat although Black’s poor academic performance was “highly suggestive of learning\ndisability or borderline intellectual capacity,” she found “no compelling evidence that\nthe lower-functioning picture I see now in Mr. Black’s intellectual testing emerged prior\nto 18.”\n\n          2.     Black’s brain damage\n\n          Another key point of contention is whether Black suffered from brain damage\nat an early age. Dr. Albert Globus, an expert in psychiatry and neurology who examined\nBlack in 2001 in order to assess his competency to stand trial, reexamined him just\nbefore the state court’s post-conviction hearing. In addition, Dr. Ruben Gur, an expert\nin neuropsychology, testified in a video deposition taken after the hearing regarding the\ncause of Black’s brain damage. Both Drs. Globus and Gur concluded, based on MRI\nand PET-scan images of Black’s brain, that Black has extensive brain damage that was\nlikely caused by his mother’s drinking alcohol while pregnant, but might also have been\ncaused by other occurrences during his childhood.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                          Page 9\n\n\n        The State does not contest that Black currently has brain damage. But the source\nof his condition is highly disputed. This point is important to the assessment of Black’s\nlevel of intelligence by the time he was age 18. If his current brain damage existed at\nan earlier stage of his life, then his current level of intelligence is all the more probative\nof his intellectual capacity at that earlier stage because any symptoms resulting from his\nbrain damage would have also been present earlier on. Moreover, if Black’s brain was\ndamaged earlier in his life, that determination would impact the credibility of the\nconclusion by the State’s experts—who never personally met with Black—that he was\nmalingering on his recent I.Q. tests. Rather than offer an alternative explanation for his\nbrain damage, the State argues that Black did not sufficiently prove that his brain\ndamage was caused by the time he was age 18.\n\n        3.      Expert assessments of Black’s adaptive deficits\n\n        In addition to assessing Black’s numerical I.Q. level, the various expert witnesses\nat his state post-conviction Atkins hearing testified regarding his level of adaptive\nfunctioning. These experts explained how Black functions in society and when his\nrelevant characteristics manifested themselves. They dispute whether Black displays\nadaptive deficits and, if so, when these problems arose.\n\n        Black’s experts explained that he has difficulty interacting according to ordinary\nsocial conventions and that he is paranoid, delusional, naive, and inappropriately happy.\nThey also determined that he has deficits in his communication and functional academic\nskills and that he displays symptoms of various psychiatric disorders. Based on Black’s\nchildhood experiences, as well as the alleged early onset of his brain damage, Black’s\nexperts concluded that he had adaptive deficits by the age of 18.\n\n        But the State’s experts determined that Black displayed adequate skills across a\nvariety of practical, social, and intellectual categories of behavior. Although they\nthought that Black had various personality problems and that he might suffer from\nvarious mental disorders, they did not think that Black qualified as mentally retarded.\nThe State’s experts also determined that to the extent Black displayed adaptive deficits,\nhe either strategically presented himself in that way (according to Dr. Engum) or had\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 10\n\n\ndeteriorated more recently and therefore did not display these characteristics by the age\nof 18 (according to Dr. Vaught). After recounting some of the expert testimony on these\nissues, the TCCA concluded that Black did not meet his burden of proof to show that he\nhad sufficient deficits in his adaptive behavior by the age of 18.\n\n       4.      Lay witnesses\n\n       Black presented four lay witnesses at his Atkins post-conviction hearing to testify\nregarding various aspects of his social and educational history.                    Mary\nSmithson-Craighead, who started working as an administrator at Black’s elementary\nschool in 1965 and was in charge of Black’s grade level for, at most, a year and a half,\ntestified regarding the conditions at Black’s school. Black’s sister, Melba Corley, talked\nabout Black’s upbringing. Al Dennis, Black’s high school football coach, discussed\nBlack’s experience on the football team.            Finally, Richard Corley, Black’s\nbrother-in-law, testified about Black’s job as a courier at an insurance company. Both\nsides draw on various aspects of these witnesses’ testimony to support their respective\npositions concerning Black’s level of intellectual functioning and his adaptive behavior\nby the age of 18.\n\n       5.      Prior decisions on Black’s Atkins claim\n\n       The state trial court determined that Black’s post-conviction Atkins claim merited\nan evidentiary hearing. At this evidentiary hearing, Black had the burden of showing by\na preponderance of the evidence that he met Tennessee’s definition of mental retardation\nunder Atkins. After the hearing concluded, the court summarized what it viewed as the\ndeterminative evidence from the voluminous record and, based on this evidence, denied\nBlack’s Atkins claim for post-conviction relief.\n\n       The TCCA affirmed the trial court’s rejection of Black’s claim. In its “Analysis”\nsection, the TCCA mostly reviewed, without taking a stance on, the conflicting expert\nassessments of the factual record. But the TCCA did recognize that, according to\nBlack’s experts, the Flynn Effect and/or the SEM brings his middle set of I.Q. scores\ninto the mentally retarded range. Based on Howell v. State, 151 S.W.3d 450, 457 (Tenn.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 11\n\n\n2004), however, the TCCA determined that it was prohibited from considering these\nscientific concepts in assessing Black’s numerical I.Q. score.\n\n        The TCCA’s assessment of the factual record also makes clear that it was\nskeptical of the opinions of Drs. Globus and Gur regarding when Black’s brain damage\noccurred. But the TCCA did not go so far as to make a definitive factual conclusion\nregarding the date of onset of Black’s brain damage. The court also discounted Dr.\nGrant’s conclusion that Black displayed deficits in his adaptive behavior because,\nalthough Dr. Grant observed that Black had never engaged in a number of commonplace\nactivities, “there is no proof in the record that [Black] was unable to do these things.”\nBlack, 2005 WL 2662577, at *15. It also pointed out that none of Black’s childhood I.Q.\nscores fell in the mentally retarded range. But the TCCA reached its ultimate conclusion\nthat “the proof in the record simply does not support that [Black’s] I.Q. was below\nseventy or that [Black] had deficits in his adaptive behavior prior to age eighteen”\nwithout stating which pieces of evidence were essential to its conclusion. Id. at *17.\n\n        In denying habeas relief to Black on his Atkins claim, the district court\napprovingly referenced the TCCA’s rejection of the application of the Flynn Effect and\nthe SEM based on Howell. It also concluded, based on a review of how other\njurisdictions have dealt with the Flynn Effect, that the TCCA’s rejection of these\nconcepts did not render the state process arbitrary, unreasonable, or less than full and\nfair.\n\n        The district court further rejected Black’s three remaining arguments in support\nof his Atkins claim. First, the court determined that the TCCA’s discounting of Dr.\nGrant’s adaptive-deficits assessment did not render the state court’s decision\nunreasonable. It found no basis to question the TCCA’s ruling that, although the record\nindicated that Black had not performed the commonplace daily tasks mentioned by Dr.\nGrant, there was no showing that Black could not perform these tasks. Second, the court\nconcluded that because Black had not shown that an aptitude test is equivalent to an I.Q.\ntest, his low ninth-grade Differential Aptitude Test scores did not mean that his I.Q. was\n70 or below by age 18.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 12\n\n\n       Finally, the district court noted that “the evidence before the state court . . . may\nor may not indicate that [Black’s brain damage] existed and caused mental retardation”\nby the time Black was 18 years of age. The court based this observation on its\ndetermination that Drs. Globus and Gur were unable to point definitively to the cause\nof Black’s brain damage or establish that this injury was the cause of Black’s mental\nretardation. It also quoted the TCCA’s reference to “Dr. Vaught’s testimony explaining\nthe difference between mental illness and mental retardation, and her conclusion that\n[Black’s] early difficulties were likely caused by mental health issues or learning\ndisabilities, rather than mental retardation.”\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Standard of review\n\n       Because Black filed his habeas petition after the enactment of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), AEDPA’s provisions apply to his\ncase. Murphy v. Ohio, 551 F.3d 485, 493 (6th Cir. 2009). This court in Murphy set out\nthe standard of review under AEDPA as follows:\n\n               Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus\n       with respect to a “claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court\n       proceedings” if the state court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved\n       an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n       determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C.\n       § 2254(d)(1). A habeas petition may also be granted if the state court’s\n       decision “was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n       light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” Id.\n       § 2254(d)(2). A state-court decision is contrary to clearly established\n       federal law “if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing\n       law set forth in [the Supreme Court’s] cases” or “if the state court\n       confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a\n       decision of [the Supreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result\n       different from [that] precedent.” Williams [v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405\n       (2000)]. A state-court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly\n       established federal law if it “correctly identifies the governing legal rule\n       but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner’s case,”\n       id. at 407-08, 120 S. Ct. 1495, or if it “either unreasonably extends or\n       unreasonably refuses to extend a legal principle from Supreme Court\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 13\n\n\n       precedent to a new context,” Seymour v. Walker, 224 F.3d 542, 549 (6th\n       Cir.2000).\n\nId. at 493-94.    And, as the Supreme Court recently explained, our review under\n§ 2254(d)(1) is “limited to the record that was before the state court.” Cullen v.\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 1398 (2011).\n\nB.     Atkins claim\n\n       Black claims that he is not subject to the death penalty because he is mentally\nretarded, so that his execution would violate Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002).\nA few months before Atkins was decided, the Tennessee Supreme Court also held as a\nmatter of first impression in Van Tran v. State, 66 S.W.3d 790 (Tenn. 2001), that the\nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the\nTennessee Constitution prohibit the execution of mentally retarded individuals. Id. at\n794, 812. Van Tran further held that its newly announced rule applied retroactively to\ncases on collateral review. Id. at 811.\n\n       The Supreme Court held in Atkins that, in light of “our evolving standards of\ndecency,” the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of mentally retarded offenders.\nId. at 321. But the Court in Atkins did not define what it means to be “mentally\nretarded,” instead “leav[ing] to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to\nenforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.” Id. at 317\n(brackets omitted) (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 405, 416-17 (1986)\n(dealing with the issue of insanity)).\n\n       Under Tennessee law, capital defendants are considered mentally retarded for the\npurposes of an Atkins claim if they have an “intellectual disability” under\n§ 39-13-203(a) of the Tennessee Code. Howell v. State, 151 S.W.3d 450, 457 (Tenn.\n2004). Defendants will meet this standard if (1) they have “[s]ignificantly subaverage\ngeneral intellectual functioning as evidenced by a functional intelligence quotient (I.Q.)\nof seventy or below; and (2) [they have d]eficits in adaptive behavior; and (3) [t]he\nmental retardation must have been manifested during the developmental period, or by\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 14\n\n\neighteen (18) years of age.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-203(a). Under Tennessee law,\ndefendants have the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they\nqualify under this statutory definition. See Tenn.Code Ann. § 39–13–203(c).\n\n       In Coleman v. State, 341 S.W.3d 221 (Tenn. 2011), the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt recently issued a significant decision explaining the Atkins standard under\nTennessee law. The State argues that this “recent state-law decision can have no impact\non the reasonableness of the state courts’ application of federal law or on the\nreasonableness of the state courts’ factual determinations in light of the evidence\npresented in state court.”    This argument raises three distinct objections to our\nconsideration of Coleman, all of which we find have no merit.\n\n       1.      Application of Coleman in the present case\n\n       First, citing Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1388 (2011), the State argues that,\nunder AEDPA, Black is limited to the record that was before the state court at the time\nthe latter rendered its decision. But Cullen explicitly dealt with the parameters of the\nfactual record that the district court may consider on habeas review. Id. at 1399-1400.\nColeman, however, elucidates Tennessee’s interpretation of Atkins’s legal standard.\nCullen therefore does not prevent us from considering Coleman’s interpretation of Atkins\nunder Tennessee law.\n\n       The state also focuses on the fact that Coleman is a “recent state-law decision.”\nBut the date of the Coleman decision does not prevent us from considering its impact on\nthe present case because Atkins “has been made retroactive to cases on collateral\nreview.” In re Bowling, 422 F.3d 434, 436 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n       And because “Atkins reserved for the states ‘the task of developing appropriate\nways to enforce the constitutional restriction,’” id. at 436-37 (quoting Atkins, 536 U.S.\nat 317), federal courts conducting habeas review routinely look to state law that has been\nissued after the defendant’s state conviction has become final in order to determine how\nAtkins applies to the specific case at hand. See Hill v. Anderson, 300 F.3d 679, 682 (6th\nCir. 2002) (remanding Hill’s Atkins habeas claim to the Ohio state courts to “develop\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 15\n\n\n[their] own procedures for determining whether a particular claimant is retarded and\nineligible for death”); Wiley v. Epps, 625 F.3d 199, 208 (5th Cir. 2010) (assessing\nwhether the defendant qualified for an evidentiary hearing on his Atkins claim based on\nthe Mississippi Supreme Court’s standard even though “Wiley was convicted before\nAtkins was decided, and although he filed his state post-conviction application before the\nMississippi Supreme Court established the state’s requirements for obtaining an Atkins\nhearing”). We will therefore consider Coleman in our review of Black’s Atkins claim\nunder AEDPA. See Fulcher v. Motley, 444 F.3d 791, 822 (6th Cir. 2006) (Clay, J.,\nconcurring) (explaining that even where a Supreme Court precedent applies\nretroactively, a federal court conducting habeas review of a state-court decision must\nstill determine whether the decision was “contrary to” the retroactively applicable\nSupreme Court precedent).\n\n       2.      Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\n\n       Under the Tennessee Code, the first requirement that a defendant must meet in\norder to be considered mentally retarded under Atkins is that he or she must have\n“[s]ignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning as evidenced by a functional\nintelligence quotient (I.Q.) of seventy (70) or below.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-203(a).\nThe Tennessee Supreme Court has determined that the statute’s incorporation of an I.Q.\nscore of 70 is a “bright-line cutoff” that does not account for “a standard error of\nmeasurement in the test scores nor consideration of any range of scores above the score\nof seventy.” Howell v. State, 151 S.W.3d 450, 458-59 (Tenn. 2004). But even this\nbright-line cutoff allows for the consideration of more than one single source in\ndetermining a defendant’s I.Q. Because the Tennessee statute “does not provide a clear\ndirective regarding which particular test or testing method is to be used” to determine\nwhether an individual is mentally retarded for purposes of death-penalty eligibility, “[a]\ncourt may certainly give more weight to one test, but should do so only after fully\nanalyzing and considering all evidence presented.” Id. at 459.\n\n       One of the defendant’s full-scale I.Q. scores in Howell was a 73 on the WAIS–III\ntest. Id. at 453. In support of his Atkins claim, the defendant presented the testimony\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 16\n\n\nof Dr. Daniel Grant (who also testified on Black’s behalf in the present case) that a score\non an I.Q. test represents a ten-point range of possible scores based on a five-point SEM\nin either direction. Id. When the SEM was considered, according to Dr. Grant, the\ndefendant’s I.Q. score of 73 in Howell fell in the mentally retarded range. Id. at 453-54.\nBut the Tennessee Supreme Court determined that Tennessee law provides a “bright-line\ncutoff” for determining whether a defendant’s I.Q. is 70 or below. Id. at 458-59. The\nCourt therefore agreed with the trial court’s refusal to interpret “the requirement of an\nI.Q. of seventy or below, as contained in the Tennessee statute, . . . as representing a\nrange of scores between sixty-five and seventy-five or below.” Id. at 457. Based on this\nreasoning, the defendant’s score of 73 was not in the mentally retarded range. (But the\nCourt in Howell remanded the case for an evidentiary because the lower court imposed\nan overly demanding burden of proof on the defendant. Id. at 465, 467.)\n\n       Turning now to the case at hand, Black argues that the Flynn Effect and the SEM\nshould be considered in determining his functional I.Q. level. Black’s experts, as\nexplained above, applied the Flynn Effect to correct for the outdated nature of the I.Q.\ntest that was taken. I.Q. scores are scaled so that the average score on any test should\nbe 100, but the Flynn Effect postulates that the longer that an I.Q. test has been in\nexistence, the higher the average score will be. See United States v. Davis, 611 F. Supp.\n2d 472, 486 (D. Md. 2009) (explaining that “the Flynn Effect means . . . that over time,\nthe test norms become outdated, such that the average score is no longer 100, but\nsomething higher”). This increase in the general level of factual information that leads\nto higher average scores on older tests explains why I.Q. test scores would increase with\nthe age of the test “without a corresponding increase in actual intelligence in the general\npopulation.” Wiley v. Epps, 625 F.3d 199, 203 n.1 (5th Cir. 2010). According to the\nFlynn Effect, scores on outdated tests thus need to be corrected for this upward deviation\nin the average score. Id. The SEM, on the other hand, “is an index of the variability of\ntest scores produced by persons forming the normative sample” that “allows the\nevaluator to know the amount of error that could be present in any test.” Thomas v.\nAllen, 607 F.3d 749, 753 (11th Cir. 2010).\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644            Black v. Bell                                    Page 17\n\n\n       As the TCCA noted, Black’s experts testified that his adult I.Q. scores, including\npre-Atkins scores, “fell within the mentally retarded range when adjusted by the [SEM]\nand/or the Flynn Effect.” Black, 2005 WL 2662577, at *14. But the court refused to\nconsider this testimony because it concluded that Howell’s bright-line cutoff prohibited\naccounting for these adjustments under Tennessee law. Id. Coleman directly addresses\nthis interpretation of Howell.\n\n               a.       The Coleman decision\n\n       The defendant in Coleman brought an Atkins claim to challenge his death\nsentence. As part of his proof that his I.Q. score was in the mentally retarded range\nunder Tennessee law, Coleman offered evidence regarding the impact of the Flynn\nEffect and the SEM in determining his ultimate I.Q. score. But the TCCA in Coleman\ndetermined, based on Howell, that Tennessee law does not provide “for the application\nof any standard error of measurement, including the ‘Flynn effect,’ to establish an IQ\nrange rather than the bright-line cutoff of 70.”              Coleman v. State, No.\nW2007-02767-CCA-R3-PD, 2010 WL 118696, at *18 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 13, 2010).\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court in Coleman acknowledged that Howell correctly\ninterpreted the Tennessee statute in holding that “an expert’s opinion regarding a\ncriminal defendant’s I.Q. cannot be expressed within a range (i.e., that the defendant’s\nI.Q. falls somewhere between 65 to 75) but must be expressed specifically (i.e., that the\ndefendant’s I.Q. is 75 or is ‘seventy (70) or below’ or is above 70).” Coleman, 341\nS.W.3d at 242. But the lower state courts had misinterpreted Howell by extending its\nreasoning too far. As the Tennessee Supreme Court explained,\n\n       following Howell v. State, some trial courts and the Court of Criminal\n       Appeals have construed our holding that Tenn. Code Ann.\n       § 39–13–203(a)(1) provided a “clear and objective guideline” for\n       determining whether a criminal defendant is a person with intellectual\n       disability to have established a mandatory requirement that only raw I.Q.\n       test scores may be used to determine whether a criminal defendant has\n       “significantly impaired general intellectual functioning” and that a raw\n       I.Q. test score above seventy (70) may be sufficient, by itself, to disprove\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 18\n\n\n        a criminal defendant’s claim that he or she is a person with intellectual\n        disability.\n\nId. at 240.\n\n        The Tennessee Supreme Court noted in Coleman that the Tennessee Code “does\nnot provide clear direction regarding how a person’s I.Q. should be determined and does\nnot specify any particular test or testing method that should be used. In fact, the statute\ndoes not even employ the words ‘test’ or ‘score.’” Id. at 241 (citation omitted). The\nstatute’s purpose is for the courts to arrive at the defendant’s true functional I.Q. score.\nId. But “[b]ecause the statute does not specify how a criminal defendant’s functional\nI.Q. should be determined, we have concluded that the trial courts may receive and\nconsider any relevant and admissible evidence regarding whether the defendant’s\nfunctional I.Q. at the time of the offense was seventy (70) or below.” Id. The practical\nimport of this reasoning is that\n\n        if the trial court determines that professionals who assess a person’s I.Q.\n        customarily consider a particular test’s standard error of measurement,\n        the Flynn Effect, the practice effect [which refers to increasing test scores\n        based on an individual being retested with the same or a similar test], or\n        other factors affecting the accuracy, reliability, or fairness of the\n        instrument or instruments used to assess or measure the defendant’s I.Q.,\n        an expert should be permitted to base his or her assessment of the\n        defendant’s “functional intelligence quotient” on a consideration of those\n        factors.\n\nId. at 242 n.55.\n\n        Allowing for the consideration of these factors was also found by the Court to\nbe “consistent with current clinical practice,” which may “require information from\nmultiple sources.” Id. at 244. Intelligence tests are just one of these sources. And\nbecause intelligence tests “are indirect rather than direct measures of intelligence,\nexperts in the field recognize that they, like other measures of human functioning, are\nnot actuarial determinations, that these tests cannot measure intelligence with absolute\nprecision and that these tests contain a potential for error.” Id. at 245 (citations,\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 19\n\n\nbrackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, recent practice in the\nTennessee courts\n\n       reflect[s] the parties’ and the courts’ existing awareness that, as a\n       practical matter, a criminal defendant’s “functional intelligence quotient”\n       cannot be ascertained based only on raw I.Q. test scores. More\n       importantly, they also reflect the parties’ conclusion that Tenn. Code\n       Ann. § 39–13–203(a) does not prevent them from presenting relevant and\n       competent evidence, other than the defendant’s raw I.Q. test scores,\n       either to prove or to disprove that the defendant’s “functional intelligence\n       quotient” when the crime was committed was “seventy (70) or below.”\n\nId. at 247-48.\n\n       The Coleman decision also recognized that “[a]scertaining a person’s I.Q. is not\na matter within the common knowledge of lay persons. Expert testimony in some form\nwill generally be required to assist the trial court in determining whether a criminal\ndefendant is a person with intellectual disability for the purpose of Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 39–13–203(a).” Id. at 241. “In formulating an opinion regarding a criminal\ndefendant’s I.Q. at the time of the offense, experts may bring to bear and utilize reliable\npractices, methods, standards, and data that are relevant in their particular fields.” Id.\nat 242. These expert opinions are subject to cross-examination, and the trial court is not\nbound to follow any particular expert. Id. But the trial court “must give full and fair\nconsideration to all the evidence presented.” Id.\n\n                 b.     Applying Coleman to the present case\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court went to great lengths in Coleman to explain why\nits decision comported with its own prior precedent, Tennessee statutory law, other\nstates’ statutes, current clinical practice (which Atkins itself noted is generally\nincorporated in the various statutory definitions), and current litigation practice. Id. at\n240-48. Even absent the Court’s guidance in Coleman, the TCCA in the present case\nclearly misinterpreted the Flynn Effect’s relevance under Howell. Although Howell\nemphasized the need to reach a single functional I.Q. score under Tennessee law, the\ndecision made no mention whatsoever of the Flynn Effect. The purpose of adjusting for\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 20\n\n\nthe Flynn Effect, after all, is to determine the single specific score that most accurately\nreflects the subject’s I.Q. And unlike the SEM, adjusting for the Flynn Effect yields\nonly one score. See United States v. Davis, 611 F. Supp. 2d 472, 488 (D. Md. 2009)\n(correcting for the Flynn Effect was found appropriate in order to more accurately\ndetermine whether the defendant met the “strict numerical cutoff”). Considering the\nFlynn Effect in determining a defendant’s I.Q. score is therefore entirely consistent with\nHowell’s stated goal of assessing whether a defendant’s single I.Q. score, rather than a\nrange of scores, meets the statute’s “bright-line cutoff.”\n\n       Whether Coleman’s holding regarding the SEM clarifies Howell or deviates from\nHowell is more ambiguous. On the one hand, Coleman affirmed Howell’s holding that\nthe Tennessee statute requires that an expert’s assessment must be expressed in terms\nof a specific I.Q. score rather than a range of scores. Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at 242. On\nthe other hand, the Court held that an expert should be permitted to consider “a particular\ntest’s standard error of measurement [the SEM], the Flynn Effect, the practice effect,”\nor other “reliable practices, methods, standards, and data” in assessing the defendant’s\nI.Q. Id. at 242 & n.55. Coleman might therefore best be read as clarifying that although\nHowell prohibits interpreting the Tennessee statute “as representing a range of scores,”\nHowell, 151 S.W. 3d at 457, it does not prevent the SEM, as well as all other relevant\nscientific evidence, from being used by an expert in determining a defendant’s single\nmost accurate functional I.Q. score. See Duncan v. United States, 552 F.3d 442, 444-45\n(6th Cir. 2009) (explaining that “a decision does not announce a new rule when it is\nmerely an application of the principle that governed a prior Supreme Court case”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In any event, regardless of whether Coleman\nclarified Howell’s holding or changed it regarding the SEM, the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt’s recent elucidation of the Atkins standard under Tennessee law must be applied\nin the present case in light of our earlier conclusion regarding Coleman’s retroactive\napplicability.\n\n       Coleman is particularly applicable because the TCCA’s decision in the present\ncase was cited to support the TCCA’s conclusion in Coleman (before Coleman reached\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 21\n\n\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court) that although evidence concerning the Flynn Effect or the\nSEM may be introduced into the record, neither of these factors may impact the court’s\nultimate determination of the defendant’s specific I.Q. score. Coleman v. State, No.\nW2007-02767-CCA-R3-PD, 2010 WL 118696, at *18 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 13, 2010).\nThe TCCA in Coleman explained that “both in Black and the present case, a challenge\nis made to the veracity of the bright-line cutoff of 70 in establishing whether a defendant\nis not subject to the death penalty.” Id. It then held that because Coleman, like Black,\nwas allowed to present evidence regarding the Flynn Effect and the SEM, the\ndefendant’s due process rights were not violated. Id. But as the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt explained in Coleman, allowing defendants to present evidence regarding the\nFlynn Effect and the SEM is not enough. Tennessee courts must also consider this\nevidence in assessing a defendant’s ultimate functional I.Q. Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at\n241-42.\n\n       3.      Onset by the age of 18\n\n       In addition to having an I.Q. of 70 or below, this low level of intellectual capacity\nmust have manifested itself by age 18 in order for the defendant to qualify as\nintellectually disabled under Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-203(a). Based on this rule, the\nTCCA in the present case denied Black’s Atkins claim because it concluded that “the\nproof in the record simply does not support that [Black’s] I.Q. was below seventy\n. . . prior to age eighteen.” Black, 2005 WL 2662577, at *17. But the TCCA did not\nexplain the extent to which this conclusion relied on any of Black’s various I.Q. scores.\nNor did it consider the potential impact of the Flynn Effect and the SEM, despite the\ncourt’s consideration of the expert testimony that discussed the impact of these factors\non Black’s middle set of I.Q. scores.\n\n       Just as the TCCA misinterpreted Howell in its Coleman decision, it made the\nsame error here in deciding whether Black had demonstrated by a preponderance of the\nevidence that he had an I.Q. of 70 or below by the time he was 18 years of age.\nAlthough Black’s experts testified regarding the value of the Flynn Effect and the SEM,\nthe TCCA refused to consider these factors as a matter of law based on Howell rather\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 22\n\n\nthan based on whether “professionals who assess a person’s I.Q. customarily consider\na particular test’s standard error of measurement [or] the Flynn Effect.” See Coleman,\n341 S.W.3d at 242 n.55. The TCCA’s decision is therefore contrary to the latest\nTennessee Supreme Court’s decision on this subject. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n362, 405 (2000) (holding that “[a] state-court decision will certainly be contrary to our\nclearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the\ngoverning law”). And because Atkins defers to the individual states to set out the\nstandard for a defendant to qualify as mentally retarded, the TCCA’s misinterpretation\nof Howell is contrary to Atkins.\n\n        Where a state court’s analysis contradicts the governing law, we must conduct\nan independent review of that issue, unconstrained by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (which\nmandates deference to state-court proceedings unless they “resulted in a decision that\nwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States”). Fulcher v. Motley, 444\nF.3d 791, 799 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that after a federal court conducting habeas\nreview determines that the state court’s decision was contrary to clearly established\nSupreme Court precedent, the “federal court is unconstrained by § 2254(d)(1) and de\nnovo review is appropriate” (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)).\nWe conduct this independent review because “we cannot grant habeas unless [the\ndefendant] is ‘in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.’” West v. Bell, 550 F.3d 542, 553 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a)).\n\n        Because the TCCA reached its ultimate conclusion that Black did not show by\na preponderance of the evidence that his I.Q. was below 70 or that he had adaptive\ndeficits by the time he was age 18, without specifying which I.Q. scores it relied on and\nwhy, “[i]t is impossible to determine . . . the extent to which the [TCCA’s] error with\nrespect to its reading of [Howell] affected its ultimate finding” that Black did not meet\nhis burden of proof. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 414; see also Mask v. McGinnis, 233 F.3d\n132, 140 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding under AEDPA that the “state court’s determination of\nfactual issues . . . were so closely intertwined with the state court’s articulation of an\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 23\n\n\nerroneous legal standard, to which we owe no deference, that we can discern no\nindependent factual issues to which we should defer”); State v. Strode, 232 S.W.3d 1,\n16 (Tenn. 2007) (holding that “the question of whether an individual is mentally retarded\nfor purposes of eligibility [for] the death penalty is a mixed question of law and fact”).\n\n       4.      Black’s adaptive behavior\n\n       Even if Black’s I.Q. was 70 or below by the time he was age 18, we recognize\nthat he must also have had deficits in adaptive behavior by the time he was 18 in order\nto be considered mentally retarded under Tennessee’s Atkins standard. Tenn. Code\nAnn. § 39-13-203(a). We therefore now turn to the issue of Black’s adaptive behavior.\n\n       In addition to explaining Tennessee’s standard for determining a defendant’s\nlevel of intellectual functioning, Coleman clarified the adaptive-deficits element of\nTennessee’s Atkins standard.       The Tennessee legislature did not define what\ncharacteristics constitute “deficits in adaptive behavior,” but the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt explained that “deficits in adaptive behavior ‘means the inability of an individual\nto behave so as to adapt to the surrounding circumstances.’” Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at\n248 (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Smith, 893 S.W.2d 908, 918 (Tenn. 1994)).\n\n       Although Smith did not adopt the clinical definition of deficits in adaptive\nbehavior, “Tennessee’s trial and appellate courts have repeatedly relied upon expert\nanalysis of adaptive behavior or functioning predicated upon definitions advanced within\nthe relevant medical and psychological community and authoritative texts such as the\nAAIDD Manual and the DSM–IV.” Id. These documents are, respectively, the Manual\nof the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders. As in Coleman, the TCCA in the present case looked to the definition of\ndeficits in adaptive behavior that the Tennessee Supreme Court adopted in Van Tran v.\nState, 66 S.W.3d 790, 795 (Tenn. 2001), which in turn based its standard on the\nDSM–IV.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 24\n\n\n       The TCCA quoted the following passage from Van Tran that it had previously\nquoted in Coleman:\n\n       The second part of the definition—adaptive functioning—refers to how\n       effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well\n       they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone\n       in their particular age group, socio-cultural background, and community\n       setting. As discussed, a mentally retarded person will have significant\n       limitations in at least two of the following basic skills: communication,\n       self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community\n       resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health,\n       and safety. Influences on adaptive functioning may include the\n       individual’s education, motivation, personality characteristics, social and\n       vocational opportunities, and the mental disorders and general medical\n       conditions that may coexist with Mental Retardation.\n\nBlack, 2005 WL 2662577, at *15 (quoting Van Tran, 66 S.W. 2d at 795 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n       The TCCA in Coleman determined that although “[Coleman] has established that\nhe has deficits in academic performance, he has not established that he suffers\nsubstantial limitations in at least two adaptive behavioral skill areas. Accordingly, he\nhas failed to establish that he has adaptive deficits by a preponderance of the evidence.”\nColeman v. State, No. W2007-02767-CCA-R3-PD, 2010 WL 118696, at *29 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Jan. 13, 2010). The Tennessee Supreme Court disagreed with the analysis\nof both the TCCA and the trial court. It determined that their erroneous interpretation\nof Howell led them to assess the possible causes of Coleman’s apparent deficiencies in\nadaptive behavior without the benefit of “testimony indicating that Mr. Coleman’s\nintellectual capacities rendered him intellectually disabled.” Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at\n249.\n\n       The lower courts’ failure to properly consider this evidence concerning\nColeman’s intellectual capacities might have had “a substantial and injurious impact on\nthe trial court and the Court of Criminal Appeals’ decision-making in weighing the\nrelative strengths of the causes of the seeming deficits in Mr. Coleman’s adaptive\nbehavior.” Id. Notably, the Tennessee Supreme Court found that the lower courts’\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 25\n\n\nassessment of Coleman’s adaptive deficits was flawed, even though they acknowledged\nthat he had various personality problems, because they did not think that these\npersonality problems could be characterized as deficits in adaptive behavior under\nTennessee’s Atkins standard. See id.\n\n       This problem is equally present in the TCCA’s decision in the present case. Just\nas in Coleman, the TCCA here cited a number of expert assessments indicating that\nBlack had various personality problems, but it concluded that these issues did not\namount to deficits in his adaptive behavior. Black, 2005 WL 2662577, at *6-7, 10,\n15-16. Even the State’s experts acknowledged that Black has serious personality\nproblems. Coleman’s conclusion that the erroneous exclusion of expert testimony\nconcerning adjustments to Coleman’s I.Q. score might have had “a substantial and\ninjurious impact on the [lower courts’] decision-making in weighing the relative\nstrengths of the causes of the seeming deficits in Mr. Coleman’s adaptive behavior” is\ntherefore equally applicable in the present case. See Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at 249.\n\n       The relevant question, however, is whether Black displayed the requisite deficits\nin his adaptive behavior by the time he was 18 years of age. See Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 39-13-203(a).     As with the TCCA’s analysis of Black’s level of intellectual\nfunctioning, its conclusory reliance on the record as a whole and the ambiguity of the\nconflicting evidence make the TCCA’s errors in assessing Black’s adaptive deficits\nextend to the determination of whether these adaptive deficits manifested themselves by\nthe time Black was age 18. The TCCA’s analysis of the adaptive-deficits issue in the\npresent case is thus contrary to Coleman.\n\n       In addition to connecting the analysis of adaptive deficits to the proper\nassessment of intellectual capacities, Coleman contains several legal principles regarding\nadaptive deficits that are relevant to the analysis in the present case. The Tennessee\nSupreme Court held that “the definition of ‘intellectual disability’ embraces a\nheterogeneous population ranging from persons who are totally dependent to persons\nwho are nearly independent.” Id. at 231. This position supports the idea that a court\nreviewing whether a defendant is mentally retarded “must focus on Defendant’s deficits,\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 26\n\n\nnot his abilities.” United States v. Lewis, No. 1:08 CR 404, 2010 WL 5418901, at *30\n(N.D. Ohio Dec. 23, 2010). Various experts from both sides in the present case also\ntestified that someone might be mentally retarded but still be able to carry out any of a\nnumber of everyday activities, such as maintaining a simple job or driving a car. A full,\nindependent review of whether Black showed by a preponderance of the evidence that\nhe displayed adaptive deficits by the time he was age 18 must therefore look at his\nweaknesses instead of at his strengths.\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court in Coleman also determined that the lower courts\nerred in\n\n       their decision to distinguish between Mr. Coleman’s mental illness and\n       his intellectual disability as separate causes of his adaptive limitations.\n       By concluding that Mr. Coleman’s adaptive deficiencies were caused by\n       his mental illness alone, the lower courts treated Mr. Coleman’s mental\n       illness and intellectual disabilities as separate dichotomous spheres rather\n       than as interwoven causes.\n\nColeman, 341 SW3d at 249.\n\n       In making this point, the Tennessee Supreme Court explained that there is no\nconsensus among the various state courts around the country, nor in the scientific\nliterature, regarding “the role of causation with regard to assessing deficits in adaptive\nbehavior.” Id. at 250. The Tennessee Supreme Court in Coleman did not resolve this\nconflict because it determined that the matter should be addressed only after the record\nwas more complete. Id. at 252. But even with the less-than-complete record before it,\nthe Court noted that the expert testimony in the record established that mental retardation\nand other mental disorders are not mutually exclusive. See id. at 252-53. Rather, mental\nretardation and any number of other factors may coexist as comorbid causes of a\ndefendant’s deficient adaptive functioning. See id.\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court thus concluded that the TCCA had erred in\nholding that Coleman’s adaptive deficits were caused solely by his mental illness,\nwithout considering evidence that “intellectual disability and mental illness were\ninter-related and served to aggravate each other, combining to limit Mr. Coleman’s\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 27\n\n\nadaptive functionality.” Id. at 252. Moreover, although the Tennessee Supreme Court\ndid not make a conclusive legal determination concerning the causal relationship\nbetween mental retardation and mental illness, the legal precedents and scientific\nliterature that it cited explain that, at a minimum, courts must consider the possibility\nthat a defendant’s mental retardation and other mental illnesses might be comorbid\ncauses of a defendant’s personality problems. See id. at 251-53; Lewis, 2010 WL\n5418901, at *32 (“Indeed, individuals with intellectual disability are three to four times\nmore likely to have comorbid mental disorders than the general population.”). Coleman\nthus establishes that even where a defendant suffers from mental illness, that finding\ndoes not preclude a concomitant determination that the defendant’s personality problems\nconstitute adaptive deficits under Tennessee’s Atkins standard.\n\n       The TCCA in the present case repeatedly cited evidence that it interpreted as\nsupporting the existence of Black’s mental illness but not of his mental retardation. For\nexample, the TCCA explained that Dr. Engum “believed that Petitioner suffered from\npersonality problems, delusional problems, or psychological difficulties, [but that] those\nissues are separate and apart from the issue of whether Petitioner was mentally retarded.”\nBlack, 2005 WL 2662577, at *16. The TCCA also concluded, based on Dr. Vaught’s\ntestimony, that mental retardation “has nothing, however, to do with mental illness.” Id.\nat *10. This reasoning is similar to the TCCA’s error in Coleman of treating “Mr.\nColeman’s mental illness and intellectual disabilities as separate dichotomous spheres\nrather than as interwoven causes.” Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at 249. On remand, a proper\nanalysis of Black’s case under Coleman must consider the potential relationship between\nmental retardation and mental illness.\n\n       5.      Conclusion on Black’s Atkins claim\n\n       Overall, the record is rife with conflicting testimony regarding Black’s level of\nintelligence and adaptive deficits by the time he was age 18. The TCCA’s decision is\nof little help because the court made so few definitive factual determinations leading up\nto its ultimate conclusion that Black did not show by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat he qualifies as mentally retarded. Moreover, the TCCA did not have the benefit of\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 28\n\n\nColeman’s guidance when it refused to consider either the Flynn Effect or the SEM in\nevaluating the mental-retardation issue. Habeas review by the district court was\nsimilarly constrained.\n\n        The rules governing what factors may be considered in determining whether a\ndefendant qualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins deal with questions of law. See\nClark v. Quarterman, 457 F.3d 441, 444 (5th Cir. 2006) (holding that the rules\nregulating the factors involved in the ultimate determination of whether a defendant\nqualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins raise questions of law); see also Murphy v.\nOhio, 551 F.3d 485, 510 (6th Cir. 2009) (reviewing the state court’s resolution of the\ndefendant’s Atkins claim under AEDPA’s standard for questions of law). The TCCA’s\nassessment of Black’s level of intellectual and adaptive functioning was therefore\ncontrary to Coleman under AEDPA’s legal standard.\n\n        Ordinarily, where the state court’s decision is contrary to clearly established law\nunder AEDPA, we will conduct an independent review of the record in order to\ndetermine whether the defendant is “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws\nor treaties of the United States.” West v. Bell, 550 F.3d 542, 553 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a)); Fulcher v. Motley, 444 F.3d 791, 799 (6th Cir. 2006)\n(holding that when we determine that the state court contradicted the governing law, we\nmust conduct an independent review, unconstrained by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)). But we\nwill refrain from reaching any independent conclusions ourselves because no court has\nyet analyzed Black’s Atkins claim according to the proper legal standard, which was set\nout by the Tennessee Supreme Court in Coleman. See Alley v. Bell, 405 F.3d 371, 372\n(6th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (granting rehearing en banc and remanding the case for the\ndistrict court to determine in the first instance whether it had jurisdiction to consider the\ndeath-row inmate’s motion for relief from judgment in light of an intervening case that\nthe district court did not originally consider); see also Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, 175 F.3d\n378, 399 (6th Cir. 1999) (vacating the district court’s grant of summary judgment on the\nplaintiff’s retaliation claim and remanding the case for the district court to apply the\ncorrect legal standard in the first instance).\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                      Page 29\n\n\n        A complete review must apply the correct legal standard to all of the relevant\nevidence in the record. We therefore VACATE the district court’s denial of Black’s\nAtkins claim and REMAND the case for it to review the record based on the standard\nset out in Coleman and consistent with this opinion.\n\n        6. Response to Dissent\n\n        We note that our dissenting colleague vigorously argues that Coleman “does\nnothing to implicate [Black’s] Atkins claim,” that “AEDPA forecloses consideration of\nthis state court precedent as a ground for relief,” and that a “[r]emand is unnecessary,\ninappropriate, and flatly contrary to federal law.” For all of the reasons set forth above\nin this Part II. B., we respectfully disagree.\n\n        Moreover, we believe that the dissent fails to recognize that this case raises a\nunique set of circumstances. Retroactively applicable new rules under AEDPA and\nunder Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), are exceedingly rare occurrences. See\nOchoa v. Sirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that “Atkins reflects\none of the rare instances in which the Supreme Court has announced a new rule of\nconstitutional law that it has also expressly made retroactively applicable to cases on\ncollateral review”). For the Supreme Court to explicitly leave to the states the task of\ndefining the contours of such rules is even more out of the ordinary. But these are the\nunique circumstances that we face in this case, which is why we are convinced that a\nremand to the district court for reconsideration of Black’s Atkins claim in light of\nColeman is the proper resolution of this issue.\n\nC.      Competency to stand trial\n\n        Black also challenges the state court’s determination that he was competent to\nstand trial. He argues that, at the very least, the district court should have granted him\nan evidentiary hearing on this issue. To be competent to stand trial, a defendant must\nhave “‘sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding’ and ‘a rational as well as factual understanding of the\nproceedings against him.’” Filiaggi v. Bagley, 445 F.3d 851, 858 (6th Cir. 2006)\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 30\n\n\n(quoting Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960) (per curiam)). “[E]vidence\nof a defendant’s irrational behavior, his demeanor at trial, and any prior medical opinion\non competence to stand trial are all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is\nrequired, but . . . even one of these factors standing alone may, in some circumstances,\nbe sufficient.” Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 180 (1975).\n\n       A defendant’s competence to stand trial is a question of fact. Filiaggi, 445 F.3d\nat 858. Under AEDPA, assuming that the state court’s legal standard for determining\nwhether a defendant is competent is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent, the court’s factual competency\ndetermination “must be upheld unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the\ncontrary.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Black argues that neither his experts nor the State’s experts conducted a thorough\nevaluation of either his social history or his psychological and neurological impairments\nin assessing his competency to stand trial. But Black relies on evidence from his\npost-conviction proceedings, which was produced long after his trial, in order to support\nthis claim.    Although such after-the-fact evidence is relevant to competency\ndeterminations, “[t]he critical question is whether the evidence relied upon for\ndetermining a defendant’s competence at an earlier time of trial was evidence derived\nfrom knowledge contemporaneous to trial.” Bowers v. Battles, 568 F.2d 1, 4 (6th Cir.\n1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). Psychiatric opinions offered years after a\nhabeas petitioner’s trial are therefore not nearly as relevant as those issued at the time\nof trial. Harries v. Bell, 417 F.3d 631, 636 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n       Black received a competency hearing shortly before his trial. At this hearing, a\npsychologist and one of Black’s attorneys testified on Black’s behalf that he was unable\nto understand the judicial process, did not understand his attorneys’ role, did not\nunderstand the consequences of the trial, and that he was unable to assist his attorneys.\nBut the prosecution’s three mental-health experts all interviewed Black and testified that\nalthough his intelligence was at the lower end of the normal range and that he probably\nhad a personality disorder, he was not delusional and was competent to stand trial.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 31\n\n\n       The trial court then appointed another expert, a psychiatrist, to evaluate Black.\nThis expert concluded that Black was “clearly competent.” The court adopted this\nconclusion. When Black’s attorneys raised the competency issue again after voir dire,\nthis same expert reinterviewed Black and once more found that he was competent. The\ntrial court then reaffirmed its ruling that Black was competent to stand trial. In\nreviewing Black’s competency claim on direct appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court\ndetermined that Black “understood the nature and object of the proceedings against him\nand was able to consult with and assist counsel in preparing his defense.” State v. Black,\n815 S.W.2d 166, 174-75 (Tenn. 1991).\n\n       Our earlier review of the TCCA’s assessment concerning whether Black is\nmentally retarded under Atkins does not compel a similar result concerning his\ncompetency to stand trial because Atkins explicitly held that “[m]entally retarded persons\nfrequently know the difference between right and wrong” and can be competent to stand\ntrial. See Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 318 (2002). The district court determined,\nand Black does not offer any evidence to the contrary, that Black’s competency\nargument relies primarily on evidence from his post-conviction proceedings. “None of\nthese experts state an opinion as to whether Petitioner met the standard for competence\nat the time of trial.” Black v. Bell, 181 F. Supp. 2d 832, 843 (M.D. Tenn. 2001). The\ndistrict court thus correctly determined that Black’s evidence did not amount to “the\nclear and convincing proof required for this Court to disregard the state court’s\nfindings.” Id. And the state court’s decision was not “contrary to, [nor did it] involve[]\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n       Black further argues that the procedures used by the state trial court to determine\nwhether he was competent were inadequate under the Due Process Clause. Due process\nin a competency hearing requires “that only the most basic procedural safeguards be\nobserved.” Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437, 453 (1992) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The court allowed both Black and the prosecution to present their expert\ntestimony at Black’s competency hearing. Then, rather than base its determination on\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 32\n\n\neither of these experts, the court appointed its own independent expert to evaluate Black.\nThe court further afforded Black a reevaluation at his attorneys’ request after the voir\ndire. Black has not pointed to any required process that he was denied. The process that\nwas undertaken in Black’s state-court competency hearing was therefore not contrary\nto, nor did it involve an unreasonable application of, the process that was required to\ndetermine Black’s competence. In rejecting Black’s challenge to the state court’s\ndetermination of his competency to stand trial, we specifically note that we make no\ndetermination regarding his claim of incompetence to be executed, which the district\ncourt dismissed without prejudice because the claim was not yet ripe. Black, 181 F.\nSupp. 2d at 882-83.\n\nD.     Ineffective assistance of counsel regarding mitigation evidence\n\n       Black next challenges the state court’s rejection of his claim that his trial\nattorneys were ineffective in investigating and presenting mitigation evidence at the\npenalty phase of his trial. He contends that his attorneys failed to investigate his social\nhistory and failed to hire a psychiatrist regarding his mental-health issues.\n\n       To establish the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Black must show that his\ncounsel’s performance (1) was deficient (i.e., that it was objectively unreasonable under\nprevailing professional norms), and (2) prejudiced the defense. See Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 (1984).            “[A] court must indulge a strong\npresumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under\nthe circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.” Id.\nat 689 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The test for prejudice is whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\nId. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.” Id. The Strickland prejudice component “focuses on the question\nwhether counsel’s deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the\nproceeding fundamentally unfair.” Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 372 (1993).\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 33\n\n\n          Defense counsel’s failure to reasonably investigate a defendant’s background and\npresent mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance.\nWiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 522-23 (2003). In assessing the reasonableness of an\nattorney’s mitigation investigation, the court considers “not only the quantum of\nevidence already known to counsel,” but also whether that evidence should have led “a\nreasonable attorney to investigate further.” Id. at 257.\n\n          Counsel has a duty to conduct an independent investigation regarding mitigating\nevidence regardless of the defendant’s reluctance to investigate and disclose such\nevidence. Harries v. Bell, 417 F.3d 631, 638 (6th Cir. 2005). Because of this obligation,\ncounsel cannot rely solely on information provided by the defendant and his family in\ndetermining the extent of a proper mitigation investigation. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.\n374, 388-89 (2005). But a “reasonably diligent counsel may draw a line when they have\ngood reason to think further investigation would be a waste.” Id. at 383.\n\n          As for demonstrating prejudice under Strickland, Black was required to show that\nhis new evidence differs “in a substantial way—in strength and subject matter—from the\nevidence actually presented at sentencing.” See Fautenberry v. Mitchell, 515 F.3d 614,\n626 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]he failure to present\nadditional mitigating evidence that is merely cumulative of that already presented does\nnot rise to the level of a constitutional violation.” Nields v. Bradshaw, 482 F.3d 442,\n454 (6th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Black claims that the TCCA’s analysis was contrary to Strickland because the\ncourt concluded that he was required to establish that “but for his counsel’s deficient\nperformance, the result of his trial would likely have been different.” As Black correctly\nargues, Strickland requires only a “reasonable probability” that the result would have\nbeen different but for his counsel’s deficient performance. He thus argues that the\nTCCA’s requirement that his attorneys’ deficient performance would “likely” have\nresulted in a different result, see Black, 1999 WL 195299, at *13, overstated the level\nof prejudice necessary for relief. The Supreme Court has in fact held that if a state court\nrejects    a   defendant’s    ineffective-assistance-of-counsel    claim    based    on   a\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644        Black v. Bell                                       Page 34\n\n\npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard for prejudice rather than asking whether there\nwas a “reasonable probability that . . . the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent,” then that decision would be contrary to clearly established federal law.\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 406 (2000) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).\n\n       But the district court emphasized that “[i]n discussing the Strickland prejudice\nstandard, courts frequently use the term ‘likely’ interchangeably with the phrase\n‘reasonable probability.’” Black, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 861 (citing Stanford v. Parker, 266\nF.3d 442, 455 (6th Cir. 2001)). The court reasoned that, in using the term “likely,” the\nTCCA “focused on the same analysis as required by the ‘reasonable probability’\nstandard.” Id. Our review of the record supports the district court’s conclusion.\n\n       Moreover, Black’s mitigation argument would fail even de novo review. He\nsummarily argues that, had his trial counsel hired a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist would\nhave easily discovered that he “suffers serious mental illness, has neurological\nimpairments, and severe memory deficits,” which would have led to a diagnosis of brain\ndamage. But Black was in fact evaluated by various mental-health experts during the\ncompetency evaluation for his trial. Black now presents additional mental-health\nevidence that was obtained during his post-conviction process that he contends should\nhave been uncovered by his penalty-phase attorneys. But Black’s claim fails because\nthere is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Black’s trial attorneys\nshould have been aware at the time of Black’s trial (including the penalty phase) that\nany further investigation into his social history would have produced more evidence\nbeyond that already obtained by the competency experts. See Wilson v. Parker, 515 F.3d\n682, 698 (6th Cir. 2008) (assessing the effectiveness of defense counsel’s mitigation\nefforts by requiring a look at counsel’s conduct “at the time of its occurrence (or when\nit should have occurred in the case of omissions)” (emphasis added)).\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 35\n\n\nE.     Ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the prosecutor’s “reward”\n       argument\n       Black further claims that his trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to\nobject to the prosecution’s penalty-phase closing argument that giving Black a life\nsentence rather than the death penalty would reward him for the additional killings of\nLatoya and Lekeisha Clay because Black was already subject to a life sentence for the\nmurder of Angela Clay. This claim is based on two Tennessee Supreme Court cases,\nState v. Smith, 755 S.W.2d 757 (Tenn. 1988), and State v. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797\n(Tenn. 1994), in which the prosecutor made similar arguments to the jury. The TCCA\nin the present case incorrectly accepted the lower court’s distinction that whereas the\ndefendants in those cases “had previously received life sentences for unrelated\nmurders . . . , [Black] was facing the death penalty in the same trial for three related\nkillings. Accordingly, as the [TCCA] noted, the jury [in the present case] could not help\nbut have full knowledge of all three sentences it was considering for the three murders.”\nBlack, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 857 (quoting the TCCA’s opinion).\n\n       The defendant in Smith was in fact tried for multiple murders in the same trial,\njust as Black was here. Although the Tennessee Supreme Court in Smith determined that\nthe two separate murders should have been tried separately, it also concluded that the\nprosecution’s “reward” argument was highly prejudicial specifically because the jury\nknew about the other murders. Smith, 755 S.W.2d at 767-68. In other words, Smith held\nthat telling the jury that a life sentence will be “no additional punishment” because of\nthe defendant’s life sentence for a different murder is inherently prejudicial to the\ndefendant even where the jury properly knows about the defendant’s life sentence for\nanother murder.\n\n       But, like the trial court, the TCCA ultimately did not decide whether counsel’s\nperformance was deficient because it agreed with the trial court that even if defense\ncounsel did make a mistake and “should have objected to the argument,” this error was\nnot prejudicial because “it is unlikely that the objection would have had any effect on\nthe jury’s decision.” Id. Black, however, claims that the prosecutor’s argument was\nprejudicial because the jury sent a note asking the trial judge whether multiple terms for\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 36\n\n\nthe murders would be served concurrently or consecutively, and it deliberated for 13\nhours, allegedly showing that the jury was considering a life sentence. But, as the TCCA\nnoted, the prosecutor made his “reward” argument about both of Angela’s daughters, yet\nthe jury sentenced Black to death for only Lakeisha’s murder. Moreover, Black’s death\nsentence was supported by six aggravating factors. We therefore agree that Black has\nnot shown a reasonable probability that, but for the prosecutor’s reward argument, the\nresult of his penalty phase would have been different.\n\nF.     Instructing the jury regarding Black’s parole eligibility\n\n       Finally, Black argues that the trial court violated his due process rights by failing\nto answer the jury’s questions regarding how long a life sentence actually was in\nTennessee, and whether he could be paroled from a life sentence. Black contends that\nhe had a due process right to have the jury receive instructions in response to these\nquestions so that he could rebut the prosecution’s improper argument that a life sentence\nwould reward Black for the murders of Latoya and Lakeisha.\n\n       In support of this argument, Black cites Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349 (1977),\nSkipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1 (1986), Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154\n(1994), and Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. 36 (2001). But none of these cases dealt\nwith the type of prosecutorial-misconduct argument that Black raises here. Gardner\ninvolved a defendant’s right to rebut information contained in a presentence report. And\nSkipper concerned a defendant’s right to offer evidence of his good behavior in prison\nin order to rebut the prosecution’s arguments regarding the defendant’s future\ndangerousness.\n\n       Simmons and Shafer provide the closest analogy to the present case. In Simmons,\nthe Court held that “where a defendant’s future dangerousness is at issue, and state law\nprohibits the defendant’s release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury\nbe informed that the defendant is not eligible for parole.” Black, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 870.\nBut if “parole is an option for a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment, . . . the\nSimmons Court emphasized that it will not second-guess the refusal of a State to allow\nproof, instruction, or argument to the jury on the availability of parole.” State v. Bush,\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                         Page 37\n\n\n942 S.W.2d 489, 503 (Tenn. 1997) (emphasis in original). And, as the district court\nexplained, “[b]ecause Tennessee is a state in which defendants sentenced to life\nimprisonment are eligible for parole, . . . Simmons does not require that the jury be given\ninformation about parole availability.” Black, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 870 (citing Bush, 942\nS.W. 2d at 503).\n\n       In fact, Shafer itself explains that Simmons does not apply where, as here, the\ndefendant might be eligible for parole based on the jury’s decision. Shafer, 532 U.S. at\n51 (“Simmons applies where[,] as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the\njury decides the appropriate sentence is life in prison.” (emphasis and internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Moreover, Black does not contend that the prosecutor’s reward\nargument put his dangerousness at issue. We therefore agree with the district court’s\ndenial of Black’s claim that he had a due process right to have the trial court answer the\njury’s questions regarding his parole eligibility and the length of his sentence.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of\nBlack’s habeas petition regarding his non-Atkins claims, VACATE the court’s judgment\nregarding the denial of Black’s petition concerning his Atkins claim, and REMAND the\ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                         Page 38\n\n\n                                   ________________\n\n                                       DISSENT\n                                   ________________\n\n        BOGGS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. In Coleman v. State, 341 S.W.3d 221 (Tenn.\n2011)—decided after oral argument in this case—the Tennessee Supreme Court\nconstrued a Tennessee statute prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded defendants\nunder Tennessee law. The panel remands Black’s case to the district court in light of\nColeman, reasoning that Coleman “elucidates Tennessee’s interpretation of Atkins’s\nlegal standard.” See Maj. Op. at p. 14. A thorough reading of Coleman reveals no such\nelucidation. Coleman is purely a construction of a state statute that makes only fleeting\nreferences to Atkins. For this reason, I cannot join the panel, and respectfully dissent.\n\n                                               A\n\n        There are three major flaws with the panel’s opinion.\n\n        First, the panel contends that it is appropriate to “look to state law that has been\nissued after the defendant’s state conviction has become final in order to determine how\nAtkins applies to the specific case at hand.” This position, while correct in the abstract,\nis not supported by the two precedents cited. In Hill v. Anderson, this court remanded\nHill’s Atkins habeas claim to the Ohio state courts—in which Hill had not yet exhausted\nhis “retardation claim”—to allow the courts to “develop [their] own procedures for\ndetermining whether a particular claimant is retarded and ineligible for death.” 300 F.3d\n679, 682 (6th Cir. 2002). Hill, decided in the uncertain aftermath of Atkins, has no\nbearing on this case. Black has had ample opportunity to exhaust and has exhausted his\nAtkins claim in state courts, and in federal courts. To the extent that Coleman has any\nbearing on Black’s case, the appropriate forum to relitigate such a claim is in state court,\nnot on remand to a federal district court.\n\n        The other case cited, Wiley v. Epps, is readily distinguishable, in light of the Fifth\nCircuit’s finding that AEDPA deference was unwarranted where the “case was\nintertwined with the alleged due process violation by the state court's failure to conduct\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 39\n\n\na hearing.” 625 F.3d 199, 208 (5th Cir. 2010). “Wiley was convicted before Atkins was\ndecided” and on collateral review was not offered an evidentiary hearing to develop his\nclaim of mental retardation. Ibid. As such, a remand was appropriate to afford Wiley an\nopportunity to state his Atkins claim. Id. at 213 (“[I]t was an unreasonable application\nof clearly established federal law for the Mississippi Supreme Court to deny Wiley’s\nAtkins claim without a hearing, and the district court correctly concluded that it was not\nbound to afford the state court's decision deference.”). In contrast, as the majority notes,\nthe state trial court “held an evidentiary hearing, but ultimately determined that Black\n[was] not mentally retarded under the Atkins standard.” See Maj. Op. at p. 4. Black has\nhad numerous opportunities to argue his Atkins claim, and the state court’s determination\nis entitled to deference. Coleman, a creature of state law, does nothing to implicate his\nAtkins claim.\n\n                                              B\n\n        Second, the state law in question, enacted in 1990, has nothing to do with Atkins\nand its resulting jurisprudence, other than the fact that it relates to the execution of\nmentally retarded individuals. Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-203(a) prohibits the execution\nof an individual with an “intellectual disability” specifically defined as “[s]ignificantly\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning as evidenced by a functional intelligence\nquotient (I.Q.) of seventy (70) or below.” The Tennessee Supreme Court announced in\nVan Tran v. State that the execution of mentally retarded individuals also violated the\nTennessee Constitution. 66 S.W.3d 790, 812 (Tenn. 2001). Noteworthy for our purposes,\nVan Tran was decided seven months before the Supreme Court’s opinion in Atkins v.\nVirginia, but after certiorari was granted. Id. at 800. The Coleman opinion itself\ndiscusses Atkins only in the background section. The Tennessee Supreme Court’s\nanalysis in Coleman—which contains only fleeting references to journal articles about\nAtkins—focuses on “construing [the state] statute,” Coleman, at 241. Coleman offers\nno “elucidation” of Atkins.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644        Black v. Bell                                       Page 40\n\n\n                                             C\n\n       Third, and perhaps most importantly, even assuming that Coleman explicated\nAtkins, such analysis would be of no moment for purposes of AEDPA. Although “Atkins\nreserved for the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the\nconstitutional restriction,” In re Bowling, 422 F.3d 434, 436-37 (6th Cir. 2005), the\nmajority is incorrect in reasoning that Coleman “enforce[s] the constitutional\nrestriction.” The Tennessee Supreme Court in Van Tran went out of its way to stress that\nits opinion—issued seven months before Atkins—was grounded on state, and not federal\nconstitutional law. 66 S.W.3d at 801 (“Accordingly, although we will refer to relevant\nanalysis under the Eighth Amendment, all of our opinions and conclusions with respect\nto the execution of mentally retarded individuals—an issue of first impression for this\nCourt—are separately and independently based upon article I, § 16 of the Tennessee\nConstitution.”). Indeed, even if the Tennessee Supreme Court did rely on an\ninterpretation of Atkins, it could not alter or elucidate the relevant AEDPA\ninquiry—which is what was “clearly established federal law” as of 2006, when the\n“TCCA affirmed” the state trial court’s decision that “Black is not mentally retarded\nunder the Atkins standard.” See Maj. Op. at p. 4.\n\n       The majority’s remand cannot be reconciled with this court’s limited role under\nAEDPA to grant relief only for an “unreasonable applications of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1)(emphasis added). See Bobby v. Dixon, 132 S.Ct. 26 (2011) (per curiam).\nColeman decided how a Tennessee state statute should apply to a Tennessee state court\nopinion decided under the Tennessee state Constitution. This case was not decided based\non the Federal Constitution, and does not implicate Black’s federal habeas challenge.\nAEDPA forecloses consideration of this state court precedent as a ground for relief.\n\n                                      *      *   *\n\n       I find no possibility that a federal court’s consideration of Coleman could afford\nBlack any remedy. Remand is unnecessary, inappropriate, and flatly contrary to federal\nlaw. Just as Coleman did, Black can seek relief under this new precedent in Tennessee\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644        Black v. Bell                                      Page 41\n\n\nstate courts “in the form of a motion to re-open his prior post-conviction petition.”\nColeman, 341 S.W.3d.at 226.\n\n       Because Black’s remedy does not lie in the federal courts, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

For the\nreasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Black’s habeas\npetition regarding his non-Atkins claims, VACATE the court’s judgment regarding his\nAtkins claim, and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Black was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for the killing of his\ngirlfriend Angela Clay and her two minor daughters, Latoya, age nine, and Lakeisha, age\nsix. He was also convicted on one count of burglary arising out of the same incident.\nBlack received a death sentence for the murder of Lakeisha, consecutive life sentences\nfor the other two murders, and fifteen years of imprisonment for the burglary.\n\nA.     Factual background\n\n       Black was born on March 23, 1956. He was 33 years old when the murders were\ncommitted in 1988. The Tennessee Supreme Court, in deciding Black’s claims on direct\nappeal, summarized the facts of this case, in part, as follows:\n\n               It appears that these bizarre and tragic murders occurred in the\n       early morning hours of Monday, March 28, 1988. The bodies of the\n       three victims were found Monday evening around 9:30 p.m. At the time\n       of the murders, the Defendant was on [a] weekend furlough from the\n       Metropolitan Workhouse in Davidson County. . . .\n                The Defendant was the boyfriend of Angela Clay, who had\n       separated from her husband, Bennie Clay, about a year before her death.\n       Bennie Clay was the father of Latoya and Lakeisha. Bennie Clay\n       testified that at the time of Angela Clay’s death, he and Angela were\n       attempting to reconcile, but the Defendant was an obstacle to the\n       reconciliation. He further testified that Angela began a relationship with\n       the Defendant after their separation and that at times she was seeing both\n       the Defendant and himself. In December, 1986, the Defendant and\n       Bennie Clay had an altercation during a dispute over Angela. . . . The\n       Defendant pled guilty to the shooting [of Bennie Clay] and received the\n       workhouse sentence, which included weekend furloughs.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                         Page 3\n\n\nState v. Black, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461340\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461340/state-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 170-71 (Tenn. 1991).\n\n       On the night of the murders, Black drove the victims to the home of Angela’s\nmother. Angela and her two daughters were last seen that evening by her mother at\naround 11 p.m. Angela’s mother testified that Angela telephoned her at approximately\n11:20 p.m. that evening after Angela returned home. That phone call was the last time\nthat any of the witnesses spoke to Angela before her death. The police arrived at\nAngela’s apartment at approximately 9:30 p.m. the following night. They did not find\nany signs of forced entry into the apartment, but they found a pool of blood on the bed\nand the body of a small child on the floor. Id. The Tennessee Supreme Court continued\nits summary of the relevant facts, citing the testimony of Dr. Charles Harlan, Chief\nMedical Examiner for Davidson County:\n\n              Investigation revealed the bodies of Angela and her nine year old\n       daughter, Latoya, in the master bedroom. Angela, who was lying in the\n       bed, had apparently been shot once in the top of the head as she slept and\n       was rendered unconscious immediately and died within minutes. . . .\n              Latoya’s body was found partially on the bed and partially off the\n       bed, wedged between the bed and a chest of drawers. She had been shot\n       once through the neck and chest. . . .\n               The body of Lakeisha, age six, was found in the second bedroom\n       lying facedown on the floor next to her bed. She had been shot twice,\n       once in the chest, once in the pelvic area. . . .\n              The receiver from the kitchen telephone was found in the master\n       bedroom. The telephone from the master bedroom was lying in the\n       hallway between the two bedrooms. The Defendant’s fingerprints were\n       the only prints recovered from the telephones. Two of his fingerprints\n       were found on the phone in the hallway, and one was on the kitchen\n       telephone receiver found in the master bedroom.\n\nId. at 171-72. A substantial amount of additional circumstantial evidence connected\nBlack to the killings. Id. at 172-73.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                           Page 4\n\n\nB.      Procedural history\n\n        In 1991, the Tennessee Supreme Court denied Black’s numerous claims on his\ndirect appeal. Black then filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the Davidson\nCounty Criminal Court. The trial court denied the petition after an evidentiary hearing,\nand the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) affirmed. Black’s petition to\nappeal the denial of his post-conviction claims to the Tennessee Supreme Court was\ndenied. The United States Supreme Court subsequently denied his petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n\n        Black then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, based\non 28 U.S.C. § 2254, seeking relief on a number of evidentiary, procedural, and\nsubstantive grounds relating to both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial, as well as\nto issues that arose in his various state-court appeals. The district court denied all 34 of\nBlack’s habeas claims, including several subclaims, in December 2001. Black v. Bell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2476873\"><a href=\"/opinion/2476873/black-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (M.D. Tenn. 2001). It then issued Black a Certificate of\nAppealability (COA) for all of the claims that it decided on the merits and denied a COA\nregarding the claims that it dismissed as procedurally defaulted. Black timely appealed\nthe court’s decision.\n\n        After the Supreme Court decided Atkins in 2002, this court granted Black’s\nmotion to hold his case in abeyance so that Black could exhaust his Atkins claim in the\nstate courts. Black then filed a motion in 2002 to reopen his post-conviction proceedings\nin the state trial court. That court determined that Black had made a sufficient showing\nfor his case to be reopened based on his Atkins claim. It held an evidentiary hearing, but\nultimately determined that Black is not mentally retarded under the Atkins standard. The\nTCCA affirmed this decision in 2006, and the Tennessee Supreme Court denied Black’s\napplication for permission to appeal. The United States Supreme Court again denied\nBlack’s petition for a writ of certiorari. This court then remanded Black’s pending\nappeal of the district court’s denial of his § 2254 petition back to the district court so that\nit could reconsider Black’s mental-retardation claim (which was one of Black’s original\n34 claims that the district court denied) in light of Atkins.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644            Black v. Bell                                        Page 5\n\n\n        The district court did so in 2008, ultimately dismissing Black’s Atkins claim on\nthe basis that “the state court was not unreasonable in stating that the proof in the record\ndid not support the conclusion, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that\n[Black’s] I.Q. was below seventy before age 18.” It also dismissed Black’s additional\nclaim that the issue of his mental retardation should have been submitted to the jury,\nruling that the claim was beyond the scope of this court’s remand order, and also because\nthe claim failed on the merits. But the district court granted Black a COA on his Atkins\nclaim, and Black timely filed an appeal. We then granted Black’s motion to expand his\nCOA to include the issue of whether he had cause to excuse the procedural default of his\nclaim that the jury improperly weighed an unconstitutional felony-murder aggravating\ncircumstance. But we denied Black’s motion to have two additional issues included in\nhis COA.\n\n        Black’s appeal of the district court’s original dismissal of his habeas claims in\n2001 and his appeal of that court’s denial of his Atkins claim in 2008 have been\nconsolidated in the present appeal. We thus have before us the issues that are within his\nCOAs from both decisions. Although Black’s COAs cover many issues, he has limited\nhis appeal to a total of five.\n\n        In addition to Black’s Atkins claim, the other four district-court determinations\nthat Black now challenges are (1) whether he was competent to stand trial and whether\nhe was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on that issue, (2) whether his trial counsel was\nconstitutionally ineffective in failing to fully investigate, present, and argue mitigating\nfactors against the death penalty, (3) whether his trial counsel was constitutionally\nineffective in failing to object to the prosecution’s comment during closing argument at\nthe penalty phase of the trial that giving Black a life sentence for all three of the murders\nwould “reward” him, and (4) whether the trial court erred by declining to clarify for the\njury, upon its request, the effect of a life sentence.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                          Page 6\n\n\nC.      Atkins background\n\n        Under Tennessee law, capital defendants are considered mentally retarded if\n(1) they have “[s]ignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning as evidenced\nby a functional intelligence quotient (I.Q.) of seventy (70) or below; (2) [they have\nd]eficits in adaptive behavior; and (3) [t]he intellectual disability must have been\nmanifested during the developmental period, or by eighteen (18) years of age.” Tenn.\nCode Ann. § 39-13-203(a).\n\n        Each side presented conflicting evidence concerning whether Black qualifies as\nmentally retarded. At Black’s post-conviction proceedings on his Atkins claim, he\npresented four lay and three expert witnesses, the affidavit of another expert, and\nnumerous exhibits in support of his claim. The State presented two expert witnesses in\nopposition. In addition, the state court considered the testimony of numerous lay and\nexpert witnesses who testified during the course of Black’s pre-Atkins proceedings.\n\n        1.      Black’s numerical I.Q. scores\n\n        One major category of evidence dealt with Black’s numerical I.Q. scores. In its\npost-conviction opinion on Black’s Atkins claim, the TCCA observed that Black’s\nintelligence has been tested numerous times, from his grade-school years through 2001.\nBlack v. State, No. M2004-01345-CCA-R3-PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13 (Tenn. Ct.\nCrim. App. Oct. 19, 2005). These scores can be grouped into the following three\ncategories: (1) tests that were administered while Black was in elementary school, with\nthe scores ranging from 83 to 97; (2) tests that were taken in preparation for Black’s trial\nand during his first round of post-conviction proceedings, from 1988 to 1997, which\nranged from 73 to 76; and (3) tests that were administered in 2001 by Black’s experts\nwho testified at his Atkins hearing, which ranged from 57 to 69. In addition, Black took\nachievement tests in high school. Dr. Daniel Grant, a psychologist and one of Black’s\nexpert witnesses, explained that Black’s scores on the Differential Aptitude Test in the\nninth grade placed his level of intelligence in the mentally retarded range.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 7\n\n\n          A major point of contention in the present case, and an issue that the TCCA did\nnot resolve, is which set of scores most accurately reflects Black’s level of intelligence\nby the time he was 18 years of age. Although Black’s first set of I.Q. scores were taken\nduring this key period of his life and are above 70, his experts challenge the accuracy of\nthese scores based on the sparse information concerning the testing details as well as the\nquestionable supervision of Black’s academic progress at his segregated elementary\nschool.\n\n          Black’s I.Q. scores from 1988 through 1997 were also above 70, but Dr. Grant\nopined that, when adjusted for the “Flynn Effect” and/or the standard error of\nmeasurement (SEM) that applies to these tests, these scores should be considered 70 or\nbelow. As Dr. Grant explained, the Flynn Effect calls for adjusting downward the score\nthat a subject receives on an older I.Q. test based on the idea that the general\npopulation’s level of knowledge increases over time, thereby raising the average score\nobtained on older tests. Dr. Patti van Eys, a clinical psychologist who submitted an\naffidavit regarding her evaluation of Black, noted that the Flynn Effect is “broadly\naccepted by the psychological community and recognized by the American Association\non Mental Retardation (AAMR).”\n\n          On the other hand, State witness Dr. Susan Vaught, a clinical psychologist,\ntestified that although the Flynn Effect is a recognized issue that a clinician might\nconsider when interpreting an I.Q. test, she did not think that it should be used to adjust\nthe numerical score that a subject received on his or her test. She explained that “[y]ou\ndon’t apply a numerical correction to a score that you get based on the Flynn Effect. It’s\nnot in that kind of use amongst clinicians who test[].” Dr. Eric Engum, the other clinical\npsychologist for the State, also rejected the practice of correcting for the Flynn Effect\nbecause “[o]ne cannot arbitrarily . . . go back in time and ‘correct’ or ‘recalculate’ a\npreviously obtained IQ based on [subsequent] changes in standardization.”\n\n          As for the SEM, Dr. Grant testified that because the I.Q. score achieved on any\nparticular test is fallible, the scores generally involve a SEM of five points up or down\nfrom the given score. Dr. Vaught similarly stated in her report that it is “typical and\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644           Black v. Bell                                         Page 8\n\n\nexpected” under the prevailing standard of practice “to consider the [SEM] for any given\ntest in order to determine if a patient’s score could fall below 70.”\n\n          The experts also disagree about the relevance of Black’s 2001 I.Q. scores. Dr.\nVaught conceded that, based on these most recent I.Q. scores, Black “currently meets\nthe first criterion for mental retardation.” Black, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *14. But she and\nDr. Engum were suspicious of the scores’ validity based on comparisons to other\nindications of Black’s level of intelligence. They suspected that Black was malingering\n(i.e., artificially deflating his scores) during these later tests. Black’s experts, on the\nother hand, specifically determined that he was not malingering, and they were highly\ncritical of the opinion of the State’s experts that Black was malingering based solely on\nthe written record, without having personally interviewed him.\n\n          Black’s experts determined that his I.Q. fell in the mentally retarded range by the\ntime he was age 18, but the State’s experts disagreed. Dr. Vaught, in particular, noted\nthat although Black’s poor academic performance was “highly suggestive of learning\ndisability or borderline intellectual capacity,” she found “no compelling evidence that\nthe lower-functioning picture I see now in Mr. Black’s intellectual testing emerged prior\nto 18.”\n\n          2.     Black’s brain damage\n\n          Another key point of contention is whether Black suffered from brain damage\nat an early age. Dr. Albert Globus, an expert in psychiatry and neurology who examined\nBlack in 2001 in order to assess his competency to stand trial, reexamined him just\nbefore the state court’s post-conviction hearing. In addition, Dr. Ruben Gur, an expert\nin neuropsychology, testified in a video deposition taken after the hearing regarding the\ncause of Black’s brain damage. Both Drs. Globus and Gur concluded, based on MRI\nand PET-scan images of Black’s brain, that Black has extensive brain damage that was\nlikely caused by his mother’s drinking alcohol while pregnant, but might also have been\ncaused by other occurrences during his childhood.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                          Page 9\n\n\n        The State does not contest that Black currently has brain damage. But the source\nof his condition is highly disputed. This point is important to the assessment of Black’s\nlevel of intelligence by the time he was age 18. If his current brain damage existed at\nan earlier stage of his life, then his current level of intelligence is all the more probative\nof his intellectual capacity at that earlier stage because any symptoms resulting from his\nbrain damage would have also been present earlier on. Moreover, if Black’s brain was\ndamaged earlier in his life, that determination would impact the credibility of the\nconclusion by the State’s experts—who never personally met with Black—that he was\nmalingering on his recent I.Q. tests. Rather than offer an alternative explanation for his\nbrain damage, the State argues that Black did not sufficiently prove that his brain\ndamage was caused by the time he was age 18.\n\n        3.      Expert assessments of Black’s adaptive deficits\n\n        In addition to assessing Black’s numerical I.Q. level, the various expert witnesses\nat his state post-conviction Atkins hearing testified regarding his level of adaptive\nfunctioning. These experts explained how Black functions in society and when his\nrelevant characteristics manifested themselves. They dispute whether Black displays\nadaptive deficits and, if so, when these problems arose.\n\n        Black’s experts explained that he has difficulty interacting according to ordinary\nsocial conventions and that he is paranoid, delusional, naive, and inappropriately happy.\nThey also determined that he has deficits in his communication and functional academic\nskills and that he displays symptoms of various psychiatric disorders. Based on Black’s\nchildhood experiences, as well as the alleged early onset of his brain damage, Black’s\nexperts concluded that he had adaptive deficits by the age of 18.\n\n        But the State’s experts determined that Black displayed adequate skills across a\nvariety of practical, social, and intellectual categories of behavior. Although they\nthought that Black had various personality problems and that he might suffer from\nvarious mental disorders, they did not think that Black qualified as mentally retarded.\nThe State’s experts also determined that to the extent Black displayed adaptive deficits,\nhe either strategically presented himself in that way (according to Dr. Engum) or had\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 10\n\n\ndeteriorated more recently and therefore did not display these characteristics by the age\nof 18 (according to Dr. Vaught). After recounting some of the expert testimony on these\nissues, the TCCA concluded that Black did not meet his burden of proof to show that he\nhad sufficient deficits in his adaptive behavior by the age of 18.\n\n       4.      Lay witnesses\n\n       Black presented four lay witnesses at his Atkins post-conviction hearing to testify\nregarding various aspects of his social and educational history.                    Mary\nSmithson-Craighead, who started working as an administrator at Black’s elementary\nschool in 1965 and was in charge of Black’s grade level for, at most, a year and a half,\ntestified regarding the conditions at Black’s school. Black’s sister, Melba Corley, talked\nabout Black’s upbringing. Al Dennis, Black’s high school football coach, discussed\nBlack’s experience on the football team.            Finally, Richard Corley, Black’s\nbrother-in-law, testified about Black’s job as a courier at an insurance company. Both\nsides draw on various aspects of these witnesses’ testimony to support their respective\npositions concerning Black’s level of intellectual functioning and his adaptive behavior\nby the age of 18.\n\n       5.      Prior decisions on Black’s Atkins claim\n\n       The state trial court determined that Black’s post-conviction Atkins claim merited\nan evidentiary hearing. At this evidentiary hearing, Black had the burden of showing by\na preponderance of the evidence that he met Tennessee’s definition of mental retardation\nunder Atkins. After the hearing concluded, the court summarized what it viewed as the\ndeterminative evidence from the voluminous record and, based on this evidence, denied\nBlack’s Atkins claim for post-conviction relief.\n\n       The TCCA affirmed the trial court’s rejection of Black’s claim. In its “Analysis”\nsection, the TCCA mostly reviewed, without taking a stance on, the conflicting expert\nassessments of the factual record. But the TCCA did recognize that, according to\nBlack’s experts, the Flynn Effect and/or the SEM brings his middle set of I.Q. scores\ninto the mentally retarded range. Based on Howell v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058491/howell-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 457 (Tenn.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 11\n\n\n2004), however, the TCCA determined that it was prohibited from considering these\nscientific concepts in assessing Black’s numerical I.Q. score.\n\n        The TCCA’s assessment of the factual record also makes clear that it was\nskeptical of the opinions of Drs. Globus and Gur regarding when Black’s brain damage\noccurred. But the TCCA did not go so far as to make a definitive factual conclusion\nregarding the date of onset of Black’s brain damage. The court also discounted Dr.\nGrant’s conclusion that Black displayed deficits in his adaptive behavior because,\nalthough Dr. Grant observed that Black had never engaged in a number of commonplace\nactivities, “there is no proof in the record that [Black] was unable to do these things.”\nBlack, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *15. It also pointed out that none of Black’s childhood I.Q.\nscores fell in the mentally retarded range. But the TCCA reached its ultimate conclusion\nthat “the proof in the record simply does not support that [Black’s] I.Q. was below\nseventy or that [Black] had deficits in his adaptive behavior prior to age eighteen”\nwithout stating which pieces of evidence were essential to its conclusion. Id. at *17.\n\n        In denying habeas relief to Black on his Atkins claim, the district court\napprovingly referenced the TCCA’s rejection of the application of the Flynn Effect and\nthe SEM based on Howell. It also concluded, based on a review of how other\njurisdictions have dealt with the Flynn Effect, that the TCCA’s rejection of these\nconcepts did not render the state process arbitrary, unreasonable, or less than full and\nfair.\n\n        The district court further rejected Black’s three remaining arguments in support\nof his Atkins claim. First, the court determined that the TCCA’s discounting of Dr.\nGrant’s adaptive-deficits assessment did not render the state court’s decision\nunreasonable. It found no basis to question the TCCA’s ruling that, although the record\nindicated that Black had not performed the commonplace daily tasks mentioned by Dr.\nGrant, there was no showing that Black could not perform these tasks. Second, the court\nconcluded that because Black had not shown that an aptitude test is equivalent to an I.Q.\ntest, his low ninth-grade Differential Aptitude Test scores did not mean that his I.Q. was\n70 or below by age 18.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 12\n\n\n       Finally, the district court noted that “the evidence before the state court . . . may\nor may not indicate that [Black’s brain damage] existed and caused mental retardation”\nby the time Black was 18 years of age. The court based this observation on its\ndetermination that Drs. Globus and Gur were unable to point definitively to the cause\nof Black’s brain damage or establish that this injury was the cause of Black’s mental\nretardation. It also quoted the TCCA’s reference to “Dr. Vaught’s testimony explaining\nthe difference between mental illness and mental retardation, and her conclusion that\n[Black’s] early difficulties were likely caused by mental health issues or learning\ndisabilities, rather than mental retardation.”\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\nA.

This court in Murphy set out\nthe standard of review under AEDPA as follows:\n\n               Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus\n       with respect to a “claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court\n       proceedings” if the state court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved\n       an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n       determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C.\n       § 2254(d)(1). A habeas petition may also be granted if the state court’s\n       decision “was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n       light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” Id.\n       § 2254(d)(2). A state-court decision is contrary to clearly established\n       federal law “if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing\n       law set forth in [the Supreme Court’s] cases” or “if the state court\n       confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a\n       decision of [the Supreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result\n       different from [that] precedent.” Williams [v.

The State argues that this “recent state-law decision can have no impact\non the reasonableness of the state courts’ application of federal law or on the\nreasonableness of the state courts’ factual determinations in light of the evidence\npresented in state court.”    This argument raises three distinct objections to our\nconsideration of Coleman, all of which we find have no merit.\n\n       1.      Application of Coleman in the present case\n\n       First, citing Cullen v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213842\"><a href=\"/opinion/213842/cullen-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But Cullen explicitly dealt with the parameters of the\nfactual record that the district court may consider on habeas review. Id. at 1399-1400.\nColeman, however, elucidates Tennessee’s interpretation of Atkins’s legal standard.\nCullen therefore does not prevent us from considering Coleman’s interpretation of Atkins\nunder Tennessee law.\n\n       The state also focuses on the fact that Coleman is a “recent state-law decision.”\nBut the date of the Coleman decision does not prevent us from considering its impact on\nthe present case because Atkins “has been made retroactive to cases on collateral\nreview.” In re Bowling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791801\"><a href=\"/opinion/791801/in-re-thomas-clyde-bowling-jr-movant-04-6194-thomas-clyde-bowling/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n       And because “Atkins reserved for the states ‘the task of developing appropriate\nways to enforce the constitutional restriction,’” id. at 436-37 (quoting Atkins, 536 U.S.\nat 317), federal courts conducting habeas review routinely look to state law that has been\nissued after the defendant’s state conviction has become final in order to determine how\nAtkins applies to the specific case at hand.

We will therefore consider Coleman in our review of Black’s Atkins claim\nunder AEDPA. See Fulcher v. Motley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793986\"><a href=\"/opinion/793986/elem-ray-fulcher-v-john-motley-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (6th Cir. 2006) (Clay, J.,\nconcurring) (explaining that even where a Supreme Court precedent applies\nretroactively, a federal court conducting habeas review of a state-court decision must\nstill determine whether the decision was “contrary to” the retroactively applicable\nSupreme Court precedent).\n\n       2.      Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\n\n       Under the Tennessee Code, the first requirement that a defendant must meet in\norder to be considered mentally retarded under Atkins is that he or she must have\n“[s]ignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning as evidenced by a functional\nintelligence quotient (I.Q.) of seventy (70) or below.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-203(a).\nThe Tennessee Supreme Court has determined that the statute’s incorporation of an I.Q.\nscore of 70 is a “bright-line cutoff” that does not account for “a standard error of\nmeasurement in the test scores nor consideration of any range of scores above the score\nof seventy.” Howell v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058491/howell-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 458-59 (Tenn. 2004). But even this\nbright-line cutoff allows for the consideration of more than one single source in\ndetermining a defendant’s I.Q. Because the Tennessee statute “does not provide a clear\ndirective regarding which particular test or testing method is to be used” to determine\nwhether an individual is mentally retarded for purposes of death-penalty eligibility, “[a]\ncourt may certainly give more weight to one test, but should do so only after fully\nanalyzing and considering all evidence presented.” Id. at 459.\n\n       One of the defendant’s full-scale I.Q. scores in Howell was a 73 on the WAIS–III\ntest. Id. at 453. In support of his Atkins claim, the defendant presented the testimony\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 16\n\n\nof Dr. Daniel Grant (who also testified on Black’s behalf in the present case) that a score\non an I.Q. test represents a ten-point range of possible scores based on a five-point SEM\nin either direction. Id. When the SEM was considered, according to Dr. Grant, the\ndefendant’s I.Q. score of 73 in Howell fell in the mentally retarded range. Id. at 453-54.\nBut the Tennessee Supreme Court determined that Tennessee law provides a “bright-line\ncutoff” for determining whether a defendant’s I.Q. is 70 or below. Id. at 458-59. The\nCourt therefore agreed with the trial court’s refusal to interpret “the requirement of an\nI.Q. of seventy or below, as contained in the Tennessee statute, . . . as representing a\nrange of scores between sixty-five and seventy-five or below.” Id. at 457. Based on this\nreasoning, the defendant’s score of 73 was not in the mentally retarded range. (But the\nCourt in Howell remanded the case for an evidentiary because the lower court imposed\nan overly demanding burden of proof on the defendant. Id. at 465, 467.)\n\n       Turning now to the case at hand, Black argues that the Flynn Effect and the SEM\nshould be considered in determining his functional I.Q. level. Black’s experts, as\nexplained above, applied the Flynn Effect to correct for the outdated nature of the I.Q.\ntest that was taken. I.Q. scores are scaled so that the average score on any test should\nbe 100, but the Flynn Effect postulates that the longer that an I.Q. test has been in\nexistence, the higher the average score will be. See United States v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2004137\"><a href=\"/opinion/2004137/united-states-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 472, 486 (D. Md. 2009) (explaining that “the Flynn Effect means . . . that over time,\nthe test norms become outdated, such that the average score is no longer 100, but\nsomething higher”). This increase in the general level of factual information that leads\nto higher average scores on older tests explains why I.Q. test scores would increase with\nthe age of the test “without a corresponding increase in actual intelligence in the general\npopulation.” Wiley v. Epps, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203 n.1 (5th Cir. 2010). According to the\nFlynn Effect, scores on outdated tests thus need to be corrected for this upward deviation\nin the average score. Id. The SEM, on the other hand, “is an index of the variability of\ntest scores produced by persons forming the normative sample” that “allows the\nevaluator to know the amount of error that could be present in any test.” Thomas v.\nAllen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147406\"><a href=\"/opinion/147406/thomas-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 753 (11th Cir. 2010).\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644            Black v. Bell                                    Page 17\n\n\n       As the TCCA noted, Black’s experts testified that his adult I.Q. scores, including\npre-Atkins scores, “fell within the mentally retarded range when adjusted by the [SEM]\nand/or the Flynn Effect.” Black, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *14. But the court refused to\nconsider this testimony because it concluded that Howell’s bright-line cutoff prohibited\naccounting for these adjustments under Tennessee law. Id. Coleman directly addresses\nthis interpretation of Howell.\n\n               a.       The Coleman decision\n\n       The defendant in Coleman brought an Atkins claim to challenge his death\nsentence. As part of his proof that his I.Q. score was in the mentally retarded range\nunder Tennessee law, Coleman offered evidence regarding the impact of the Flynn\nEffect and the SEM in determining his ultimate I.Q. score. But the TCCA in Coleman\ndetermined, based on Howell, that Tennessee law does not provide “for the application\nof any standard error of measurement, including the ‘Flynn effect,’ to establish an IQ\nrange rather than the bright-line cutoff of 70.”              Coleman v. State, No.\nW2007-02767-CCA-R3-PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">118696</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *18 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 13, 2010).\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court in Coleman acknowledged that Howell correctly\ninterpreted the Tennessee statute in holding that “an expert’s opinion regarding a\ncriminal defendant’s I.Q. cannot be expressed within a range (i.e., that the defendant’s\nI.Q. falls somewhere between 65 to 75) but must be expressed specifically (i.e., that the\ndefendant’s I.Q. is 75 or is ‘seventy (70) or below’ or is above 70).” Coleman, 341\nS.W.3d at 242. But the lower state courts had misinterpreted Howell by extending its\nreasoning too far. As the Tennessee Supreme Court explained,\n\n       following Howell v. State, some trial courts and the Court of Criminal\n       Appeals have construed our holding that Tenn. Code Ann.\n       § 39–13–203(a)(1) provided a “clear and objective guideline” for\n       determining whether a criminal defendant is a person with intellectual\n       disability to have established a mandatory requirement that only raw I.Q.\n       test scores may be used to determine whether a criminal defendant has\n       “significantly impaired general intellectual functioning” and that a raw\n       I.Q. test score above seventy (70) may be sufficient, by itself, to disprove\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 18\n\n\n        a criminal defendant’s claim that he or she is a person with intellectual\n        disability.\n\nId. at 240.\n\n        The Tennessee Supreme Court noted in Coleman that the Tennessee Code “does\nnot provide clear direction regarding how a person’s I.Q. should be determined and does\nnot specify any particular test or testing method that should be used. In fact, the statute\ndoes not even employ the words ‘test’ or ‘score.’” Id. at 241 (citation omitted). The\nstatute’s purpose is for the courts to arrive at the defendant’s true functional I.Q. score.\nId. But “[b]ecause the statute does not specify how a criminal defendant’s functional\nI.Q. should be determined, we have concluded that the trial courts may receive and\nconsider any relevant and admissible evidence regarding whether the defendant’s\nfunctional I.Q. at the time of the offense was seventy (70) or below.” Id. The practical\nimport of this reasoning is that\n\n        if the trial court determines that professionals who assess a person’s I.Q.\n        customarily consider a particular test’s standard error of measurement,\n        the Flynn Effect, the practice effect [which refers to increasing test scores\n        based on an individual being retested with the same or a similar test], or\n        other factors affecting the accuracy, reliability, or fairness of the\n        instrument or instruments used to assess or measure the defendant’s I.Q.,\n        an expert should be permitted to base his or her assessment of the\n        defendant’s “functional intelligence quotient” on a consideration of those\n        factors.\n\nId. at 242 n.55.\n\n        Allowing for the consideration of these factors was also found by the Court to\nbe “consistent with current clinical practice,” which may “require information from\nmultiple sources.” Id. at 244. Intelligence tests are just one of these sources. And\nbecause intelligence tests “are indirect rather than direct measures of intelligence,\nexperts in the field recognize that they, like other measures of human functioning, are\nnot actuarial determinations, that these tests cannot measure intelligence with absolute\nprecision and that these tests contain a potential for error.” Id. at 245 (citations,\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 19\n\n\nbrackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, recent practice in the\nTennessee courts\n\n       reflect[s] the parties’ and the courts’ existing awareness that, as a\n       practical matter, a criminal defendant’s “functional intelligence quotient”\n       cannot be ascertained based only on raw I.Q. test scores. More\n       importantly, they also reflect the parties’ conclusion that Tenn. Code\n       Ann. § 39–13–203(a) does not prevent them from presenting relevant and\n       competent evidence, other than the defendant’s raw I.Q. test scores,\n       either to prove or to disprove that the defendant’s “functional intelligence\n       quotient” when the crime was committed was “seventy (70) or below.”\n\nId. at 247-48.\n\n       The Coleman decision also recognized that “[a]scertaining a person’s I.Q. is not\na matter within the common knowledge of lay persons. Expert testimony in some form\nwill generally be required to assist the trial court in determining whether a criminal\ndefendant is a person with intellectual disability for the purpose of Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 39–13–203(a).” Id. at 241. “In formulating an opinion regarding a criminal\ndefendant’s I.Q. at the time of the offense, experts may bring to bear and utilize reliable\npractices, methods, standards, and data that are relevant in their particular fields.” Id.\nat 242. These expert opinions are subject to cross-examination, and the trial court is not\nbound to follow any particular expert. Id. But the trial court “must give full and fair\nconsideration to all the evidence presented.” Id.\n\n                 b.     Applying Coleman to the present case\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court went to great lengths in Coleman to explain why\nits decision comported with its own prior precedent, Tennessee statutory law, other\nstates’ statutes, current clinical practice (which Atkins itself noted is generally\nincorporated in the various statutory definitions), and current litigation practice. Id. at\n240-48. Even absent the Court’s guidance in Coleman, the TCCA in the present case\nclearly misinterpreted the Flynn Effect’s relevance under Howell. Although Howell\nemphasized the need to reach a single functional I.Q. score under Tennessee law, the\ndecision made no mention whatsoever of the Flynn Effect. The purpose of adjusting for\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 20\n\n\nthe Flynn Effect, after all, is to determine the single specific score that most accurately\nreflects the subject’s I.Q. And unlike the SEM, adjusting for the Flynn Effect yields\nonly one score. See United States v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2004137\"><a href=\"/opinion/2004137/united-states-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 472, 488 (D. Md. 2009)\n(correcting for the Flynn Effect was found appropriate in order to more accurately\ndetermine whether the defendant met the “strict numerical cutoff”). Considering the\nFlynn Effect in determining a defendant’s I.Q. score is therefore entirely consistent with\nHowell’s stated goal of assessing whether a defendant’s single I.Q. score, rather than a\nrange of scores, meets the statute’s “bright-line cutoff.”\n\n       Whether Coleman’s holding regarding the SEM clarifies Howell or deviates from\nHowell is more ambiguous. On the one hand, Coleman affirmed Howell’s holding that\nthe Tennessee statute requires that an expert’s assessment must be expressed in terms\nof a specific I.Q. score rather than a range of scores. Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at 242. On\nthe other hand, the Court held that an expert should be permitted to consider “a particular\ntest’s standard error of measurement [the SEM], the Flynn Effect, the practice effect,”\nor other “reliable practices, methods, standards, and data” in assessing the defendant’s\nI.Q. Id. at 242 & n.55. Coleman might therefore best be read as clarifying that although\nHowell prohibits interpreting the Tennessee statute “as representing a range of scores,”\nHowell, 151 S.W. 3d at 457, it does not prevent the SEM, as well as all other relevant\nscientific evidence, from being used by an expert in determining a defendant’s single\nmost accurate functional I.Q. score. See Duncan v.

In any event, regardless of whether Coleman\nclarified Howell’s holding or changed it regarding the SEM, the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt’s recent elucidation of the Atkins standard under Tennessee law must be applied\nin the present case in light of our earlier conclusion regarding Coleman’s retroactive\napplicability.\n\n       Coleman is particularly applicable because the TCCA’s decision in the present\ncase was cited to support the TCCA’s conclusion in Coleman (before Coleman reached\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v.

App. Jan. 13, 2010).\nThe TCCA in Coleman explained that “both in Black and the present case, a challenge\nis made to the veracity of the bright-line cutoff of 70 in establishing whether a defendant\nis not subject to the death penalty.” Id. It then held that because Coleman, like Black,\nwas allowed to present evidence regarding the Flynn Effect and the SEM, the\ndefendant’s due process rights were not violated. Id. But as the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt explained in Coleman, allowing defendants to present evidence regarding the\nFlynn Effect and the SEM is not enough. Tennessee courts must also consider this\nevidence in assessing a defendant’s ultimate functional I.Q. Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at\n241-42.\n\n       3.      Onset by the age of 18\n\n       In addition to having an I.Q. of 70 or below, this low level of intellectual capacity\nmust have manifested itself by age 18 in order for the defendant to qualify as\nintellectually disabled under Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-203(a). Based on this rule, the\nTCCA in the present case denied Black’s Atkins claim because it concluded that “the\nproof in the record simply does not support that [Black’s] I.Q. was below seventy\n. . . prior to age eighteen.” Black, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *17.

The TCCA’s decision is therefore contrary to the latest\nTennessee Supreme Court’s decision on this subject. See Williams v.

Black’s adaptive behavior\n\n       Even if Black’s I.Q. was 70 or below by the time he was age 18, we recognize\nthat he must also have had deficits in adaptive behavior by the time he was 18 in order\nto be considered mentally retarded under Tennessee’s Atkins standard. Tenn. Code\nAnn. § 39-13-203(a). We therefore now turn to the issue of Black’s adaptive behavior.\n\n       In addition to explaining Tennessee’s standard for determining a defendant’s\nlevel of intellectual functioning, Coleman clarified the adaptive-deficits element of\nTennessee’s Atkins standard.       The Tennessee legislature did not define what\ncharacteristics constitute “deficits in adaptive behavior,” but the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt explained that “deficits in adaptive behavior ‘means the inability of an individual\nto behave so as to adapt to the surrounding circumstances.’” Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at\n248 (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1528630\"><a href=\"/opinion/1528630/state-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 918 (Tenn. 1994)).\n\n       Although Smith did not adopt the clinical definition of deficits in adaptive\nbehavior, “Tennessee’s trial and appellate courts have repeatedly relied upon expert\nanalysis of adaptive behavior or functioning predicated upon definitions advanced within\nthe relevant medical and psychological community and authoritative texts such as the\nAAIDD Manual and the DSM–IV.” Id. These documents are, respectively, the Manual\nof the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders. As in Coleman, the TCCA in the present case looked to the definition of\ndeficits in adaptive behavior that the Tennessee Supreme Court adopted in Van Tran v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060419\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060419/van-tran-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 795 (Tenn. 2001), which in turn based its standard on the\nDSM–IV.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 24\n\n\n       The TCCA quoted the following passage from Van Tran that it had previously\nquoted in Coleman:\n\n       The second part of the definition—adaptive functioning—refers to how\n       effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well\n       they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone\n       in their particular age group, socio-cultural background, and community\n       setting. As discussed, a mentally retarded person will have significant\n       limitations in at least two of the following basic skills: communication,\n       self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community\n       resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health,\n       and safety. Influences on adaptive functioning may include the\n       individual’s education, motivation, personality characteristics, social and\n       vocational opportunities, and the mental disorders and general medical\n       conditions that may coexist with Mental Retardation.\n\nBlack, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *15 (quoting Van Tran, 66 S.W. 2d at 795 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n       The TCCA in Coleman determined that although “[Coleman] has established that\nhe has deficits in academic performance, he has not established that he suffers\nsubstantial limitations in at least two adaptive behavioral skill areas. Accordingly, he\nhas failed to establish that he has adaptive deficits by a preponderance of the evidence.”\nColeman v. State, No. W2007-02767-CCA-R3-PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">118696</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *29 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Jan. 13, 2010). The Tennessee Supreme Court disagreed with the analysis\nof both the TCCA and the trial court. It determined that their erroneous interpretation\nof Howell led them to assess the possible causes of Coleman’s apparent deficiencies in\nadaptive behavior without the benefit of “testimony indicating that Mr. Coleman’s\nintellectual capacities rendered him intellectually disabled.” Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at\n249.\n\n       The lower courts’ failure to properly consider this evidence concerning\nColeman’s intellectual capacities might have had “a substantial and injurious impact on\nthe trial court and the Court of Criminal Appeals’ decision-making in weighing the\nrelative strengths of the causes of the seeming deficits in Mr. Coleman’s adaptive\nbehavior.” Id. Notably, the Tennessee Supreme Court found that the lower courts’\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 25\n\n\nassessment of Coleman’s adaptive deficits was flawed, even though they acknowledged\nthat he had various personality problems, because they did not think that these\npersonality problems could be characterized as deficits in adaptive behavior under\nTennessee’s Atkins standard. See id.\n\n       This problem is equally present in the TCCA’s decision in the present case. Just\nas in Coleman, the TCCA here cited a number of expert assessments indicating that\nBlack had various personality problems, but it concluded that these issues did not\namount to deficits in his adaptive behavior. Black, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6-7, 10,\n15-16. Even the State’s experts acknowledged that Black has serious personality\nproblems. Coleman’s conclusion that the erroneous exclusion of expert testimony\nconcerning adjustments to Coleman’s I.Q. score might have had “a substantial and\ninjurious impact on the [lower courts’] decision-making in weighing the relative\nstrengths of the causes of the seeming deficits in Mr. Coleman’s adaptive behavior” is\ntherefore equally applicable in the present case. See Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at 249.\n\n       The relevant question, however, is whether Black displayed the requisite deficits\nin his adaptive behavior by the time he was 18 years of age. See Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 39-13-203(a).     As with the TCCA’s analysis of Black’s level of intellectual\nfunctioning, its conclusory reliance on the record as a whole and the ambiguity of the\nconflicting evidence make the TCCA’s errors in assessing Black’s adaptive deficits\nextend to the determination of whether these adaptive deficits manifested themselves by\nthe time Black was age 18. The TCCA’s analysis of the adaptive-deficits issue in the\npresent case is thus contrary to Coleman.\n\n       In addition to connecting the analysis of adaptive deficits to the proper\nassessment of intellectual capacities, Coleman contains several legal principles regarding\nadaptive deficits that are relevant to the analysis in the present case. The Tennessee\nSupreme Court held that “the definition of ‘intellectual disability’ embraces a\nheterogeneous population ranging from persons who are totally dependent to persons\nwho are nearly independent.” Id. at 231. This position supports the idea that a court\nreviewing whether a defendant is mentally retarded “must focus on Defendant’s deficits,\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 26\n\n\nnot his abilities.” United States v. Lewis, No. 1:08 CR 404, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5418901</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *30\n(N.D. Ohio Dec. 23, 2010). Various experts from both sides in the present case also\ntestified that someone might be mentally retarded but still be able to carry out any of a\nnumber of everyday activities, such as maintaining a simple job or driving a car. A full,\nindependent review of whether Black showed by a preponderance of the evidence that\nhe displayed adaptive deficits by the time he was age 18 must therefore look at his\nweaknesses instead of at his strengths.\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court in Coleman also determined that the lower courts\nerred in\n\n       their decision to distinguish between Mr. Coleman’s mental illness and\n       his intellectual disability as separate causes of his adaptive limitations.\n       By concluding that Mr. Coleman’s adaptive deficiencies were caused by\n       his mental illness alone, the lower courts treated Mr. Coleman’s mental\n       illness and intellectual disabilities as separate dichotomous spheres rather\n       than as interwoven causes.\n\nColeman, 341 SW3d at 249.\n\n       In making this point, the Tennessee Supreme Court explained that there is no\nconsensus among the various state courts around the country, nor in the scientific\nliterature, regarding “the role of causation with regard to assessing deficits in adaptive\nbehavior.” Id. at 250. The Tennessee Supreme Court in Coleman did not resolve this\nconflict because it determined that the matter should be addressed only after the record\nwas more complete. Id. at 252. But even with the less-than-complete record before it,\nthe Court noted that the expert testimony in the record established that mental retardation\nand other mental disorders are not mutually exclusive. See id. at 252-53. Rather, mental\nretardation and any number of other factors may coexist as comorbid causes of a\ndefendant’s deficient adaptive functioning. See id.\n\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court thus concluded that the TCCA had erred in\nholding that Coleman’s adaptive deficits were caused solely by his mental illness,\nwithout considering evidence that “intellectual disability and mental illness were\ninter-related and served to aggravate each other, combining to limit Mr. Coleman’s\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 27\n\n\nadaptive functionality.” Id. at 252. Moreover, although the Tennessee Supreme Court\ndid not make a conclusive legal determination concerning the causal relationship\nbetween mental retardation and mental illness, the legal precedents and scientific\nliterature that it cited explain that, at a minimum, courts must consider the possibility\nthat a defendant’s mental retardation and other mental illnesses might be comorbid\ncauses of a defendant’s personality problems. See id. at 251-53; Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">5418901</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *32 (“Indeed, individuals with intellectual disability are three to four times\nmore likely to have comorbid mental disorders than the general population.”). Coleman\nthus establishes that even where a defendant suffers from mental illness, that finding\ndoes not preclude a concomitant determination that the defendant’s personality problems\nconstitute adaptive deficits under Tennessee’s Atkins standard.\n\n       The TCCA in the present case repeatedly cited evidence that it interpreted as\nsupporting the existence of Black’s mental illness but not of his mental retardation. For\nexample, the TCCA explained that Dr. Engum “believed that Petitioner suffered from\npersonality problems, delusional problems, or psychological difficulties, [but that] those\nissues are separate and apart from the issue of whether Petitioner was mentally retarded.”\nBlack, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2662577</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16. The TCCA also concluded, based on Dr. Vaught’s\ntestimony, that mental retardation “has nothing, however, to do with mental illness.” Id.\nat *10. This reasoning is similar to the TCCA’s error in Coleman of treating “Mr.\nColeman’s mental illness and intellectual disabilities as separate dichotomous spheres\nrather than as interwoven causes.” Coleman, 341 S.W.3d at 249. On remand, a proper\nanalysis of Black’s case under Coleman must consider the potential relationship between\nmental retardation and mental illness.\n\n       5.      Conclusion on Black’s Atkins claim\n\n       Overall, the record is rife with conflicting testimony regarding Black’s level of\nintelligence and adaptive deficits by the time he was age 18. The TCCA’s decision is\nof little help because the court made so few definitive factual determinations leading up\nto its ultimate conclusion that Black did not show by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat he qualifies as mentally retarded. Moreover, the TCCA did not have the benefit of\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 28\n\n\nColeman’s guidance when it refused to consider either the Flynn Effect or the SEM in\nevaluating the mental-retardation issue. Habeas review by the district court was\nsimilarly constrained.\n\n        The rules governing what factors may be considered in determining whether a\ndefendant qualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins deal with questions of law.

Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (5th Cir. 2006) (holding that the rules\nregulating the factors involved in the ultimate determination of whether a defendant\nqualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins raise questions of law); see also Murphy v.\nOhio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457136\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457136/murphy-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510 (6th Cir. 2009) (reviewing the state court’s resolution of the\ndefendant’s Atkins claim under AEDPA’s standard for questions of law).

But these are the\nunique circumstances that we face in this case, which is why we are convinced that a\nremand to the district court for reconsideration of Black’s Atkins claim in light of\nColeman is the proper resolution of this issue.\n\nC.      Competency to stand trial\n\n        Black also challenges the state court’s determination that he was competent to\nstand trial. He argues that, at the very least, the district court should have granted him\nan evidentiary hearing on this issue. To be competent to stand trial, a defendant must\nhave “‘sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of\nrational understanding’ and ‘a rational as well as factual understanding of the\nproceedings against him.’” Filiaggi v.

Filiaggi, 445 F.3d\nat 858. Under AEDPA, assuming that the state court’s legal standard for determining\nwhether a defendant is competent is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent, the court’s factual competency\ndetermination “must be upheld unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the\ncontrary.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Black argues that neither his experts nor the State’s experts conducted a thorough\nevaluation of either his social history or his psychological and neurological impairments\nin assessing his competency to stand trial. But Black relies on evidence from his\npost-conviction proceedings, which was produced long after his trial, in order to support\nthis claim.    Although such after-the-fact evidence is relevant to competency\ndeterminations, “[t]he critical question is whether the evidence relied upon for\ndetermining a defendant’s competence at an earlier time of trial was evidence derived\nfrom knowledge contemporaneous to trial.” Bowers v.

At this hearing, a\npsychologist and one of Black’s attorneys testified on Black’s behalf that he was unable\nto understand the judicial process, did not understand his attorneys’ role, did not\nunderstand the consequences of the trial, and that he was unable to assist his attorneys.\nBut the prosecution’s three mental-health experts all interviewed Black and testified that\nalthough his intelligence was at the lower end of the normal range and that he probably\nhad a personality disorder, he was not delusional and was competent to stand trial.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 31\n\n\n       The trial court then appointed another expert, a psychiatrist, to evaluate Black.\nThis expert concluded that Black was “clearly competent.” The court adopted this\nconclusion. When Black’s attorneys raised the competency issue again after voir dire,\nthis same expert reinterviewed Black and once more found that he was competent. The\ntrial court then reaffirmed its ruling that Black was competent to stand trial. In\nreviewing Black’s competency claim on direct appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court\ndetermined that Black “understood the nature and object of the proceedings against him\nand was able to consult with and assist counsel in preparing his defense.” State v. Black,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461340\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461340/state-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174-75 (Tenn. 1991).\n\n       Our earlier review of the TCCA’s assessment concerning whether Black is\nmentally retarded under Atkins does not compel a similar result concerning his\ncompetency to stand trial because Atkins explicitly held that “[m]entally retarded persons\nfrequently know the difference between right and wrong” and can be competent to stand\ntrial. See Atkins v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (2002). The district court determined,\nand Black does not offer any evidence to the contrary, that Black’s competency\nargument relies primarily on evidence from his post-conviction proceedings. “None of\nthese experts state an opinion as to whether Petitioner met the standard for competence\nat the time of trial.” Black v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2476873\"><a href=\"/opinion/2476873/black-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843 (M.D. Tenn. 2001). The\ndistrict court thus correctly determined that Black’s evidence did not amount to “the\nclear and convincing proof required for this Court to disregard the state court’s\nfindings.” Id. And the state court’s decision was not “contrary to, [nor did it] involve[]\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n       Black further argues that the procedures used by the state trial court to determine\nwhether he was competent were inadequate under the Due Process Clause. Due process\nin a competency hearing requires “that only the most basic procedural safeguards be\nobserved.” Medina v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112775\"><a href=\"/opinion/112775/medina-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 (1992) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The court allowed both Black and the prosecution to present their expert\ntestimony at Black’s competency hearing. Then, rather than base its determination on\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                       Page 32\n\n\neither of these experts, the court appointed its own independent expert to evaluate Black.\nThe court further afforded Black a reevaluation at his attorneys’ request after the voir\ndire. Black has not pointed to any required process that he was denied. The process that\nwas undertaken in Black’s state-court competency hearing was therefore not contrary\nto, nor did it involve an unreasonable application of, the process that was required to\ndetermine Black’s competence. In rejecting Black’s challenge to the state court’s\ndetermination of his competency to stand trial, we specifically note that we make no\ndetermination regarding his claim of incompetence to be executed, which the district\ncourt dismissed without prejudice because the claim was not yet ripe. Black, 181 F.\nSupp. 2d at 882-83.\n\nD.     Ineffective assistance of counsel regarding mitigation evidence\n\n       Black next challenges the state court’s rejection of his claim that his trial\nattorneys were ineffective in investigating and presenting mitigation evidence at the\npenalty phase of his trial. He contends that his attorneys failed to investigate his social\nhistory and failed to hire a psychiatrist regarding his mental-health issues.\n\n       To establish the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Black must show that his\ncounsel’s performance (1) was deficient (i.e., that it was objectively unreasonable under\nprevailing professional norms), and (2) prejudiced the defense. See Strickland v.\nWashington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687-88 (1984).            “[A] court must indulge a strong\npresumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under\nthe circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.” Id.\nat 689 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The test for prejudice is whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\nId. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.” Id. The Strickland prejudice component “focuses on the question\nwhether counsel’s deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the\nproceeding fundamentally unfair.” Lockhart v. Fretwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112807\"><a href=\"/opinion/112807/lockhart-v-fretwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372 (1993).\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v. Bell                                        Page 33\n\n\n          Defense counsel’s failure to reasonably investigate a defendant’s background and\npresent mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance.\nWiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522-23 (2003). In assessing the reasonableness of an\nattorney’s mitigation investigation, the court considers “not only the quantum of\nevidence already known to counsel,” but also whether that evidence should have led “a\nreasonable attorney to investigate further.” Id. at 257.\n\n          Counsel has a duty to conduct an independent investigation regarding mitigating\nevidence regardless of the defendant’s reluctance to investigate and disclose such\nevidence. Harries v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791271\"><a href=\"/opinion/791271/ronald-r-harries-petitioner-appelleecross-appellant-v-ricky-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638 (6th Cir. 2005). Because of this obligation,\ncounsel cannot rely solely on information provided by the defendant and his family in\ndetermining the extent of a proper mitigation investigation. Rompilla v. Beard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388-89 (2005). But a “reasonably diligent counsel may draw a line when they have\ngood reason to think further investigation would be a waste.” Id. at 383.\n\n          As for demonstrating prejudice under Strickland, Black was required to show that\nhis new evidence differs “in a substantial way—in strength and subject matter—from the\nevidence actually presented at sentencing.” See Fautenberry v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386737\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386737/fautenberry-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n626 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]he failure to present\nadditional mitigating evidence that is merely cumulative of that already presented does\nnot rise to the level of a constitutional violation.” Nields v.

He thus argues that the\nTCCA’s requirement that his attorneys’ deficient performance would “likely” have\nresulted in a different result, see Black, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">195299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13, overstated the level\nof prejudice necessary for relief.

Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406 (2000) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).\n\n       But the district court emphasized that “[i]n discussing the Strickland prejudice\nstandard, courts frequently use the term ‘likely’ interchangeably with the phrase\n‘reasonable probability.’” Black, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 861 (citing Stanford v. Parker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775015\"><a href=\"/opinion/775015/kevin-stanford-v-phil-parker-warden-kentucky-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455 (6th Cir. 2001)). The court reasoned that, in using the term “likely,” the\nTCCA “focused on the same analysis as required by the ‘reasonable probability’\nstandard.” Id. Our review of the record supports the district court’s conclusion.\n\n       Moreover, Black’s mitigation argument would fail even de novo review. He\nsummarily argues that, had his trial counsel hired a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist would\nhave easily discovered that he “suffers serious mental illness, has neurological\nimpairments, and severe memory deficits,” which would have led to a diagnosis of brain\ndamage. But Black was in fact evaluated by various mental-health experts during the\ncompetency evaluation for his trial. Black now presents additional mental-health\nevidence that was obtained during his post-conviction process that he contends should\nhave been uncovered by his penalty-phase attorneys. But Black’s claim fails because\nthere is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Black’s trial attorneys\nshould have been aware at the time of Black’s trial (including the penalty phase) that\nany further investigation into his social history would have produced more evidence\nbeyond that already obtained by the competency experts. See Wilson v. Parker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1387475\"><a href=\"/opinion/1387475/wilson-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 698 (6th Cir. 2008) (assessing the effectiveness of defense counsel’s mitigation\nefforts by requiring a look at counsel’s conduct “at the time of its occurrence (or when\nit should have occurred in the case of omissions)” (emphasis added)).\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                      Page 35\n\n\nE.     Ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the prosecutor’s “reward”\n       argument\n       Black further claims that his trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to\nobject to the prosecution’s penalty-phase closing argument that giving Black a life\nsentence rather than the death penalty would reward him for the additional killings of\nLatoya and Lekeisha Clay because Black was already subject to a life sentence for the\nmurder of Angela Clay. This claim is based on two Tennessee Supreme Court cases,\nState v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2406030\"><a href=\"/opinion/2406030/state-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1988), and State v. Bigbee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tenn. 1994), in which the prosecutor made similar arguments to the jury. The TCCA\nin the present case incorrectly accepted the lower court’s distinction that whereas the\ndefendants in those cases “had previously received life sentences for unrelated\nmurders . . . , [Black] was facing the death penalty in the same trial for three related\nkillings. Accordingly, as the [TCCA] noted, the jury [in the present case] could not help\nbut have full knowledge of all three sentences it was considering for the three murders.”\nBlack, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 857 (quoting the TCCA’s opinion).\n\n       The defendant in Smith was in fact tried for multiple murders in the same trial,\njust as Black was here. Although the Tennessee Supreme Court in Smith determined that\nthe two separate murders should have been tried separately, it also concluded that the\nprosecution’s “reward” argument was highly prejudicial specifically because the jury\nknew about the other murders. Smith, 755 S.W.2d at 767-68. In other words, Smith held\nthat telling the jury that a life sentence will be “no additional punishment” because of\nthe defendant’s life sentence for a different murder is inherently prejudicial to the\ndefendant even where the jury properly knows about the defendant’s life sentence for\nanother murder.\n\n       But, like the trial court, the TCCA ultimately did not decide whether counsel’s\nperformance was deficient because it agreed with the trial court that even if defense\ncounsel did make a mistake and “should have objected to the argument,” this error was\nnot prejudicial because “it is unlikely that the objection would have had any effect on\nthe jury’s decision.” Id. Black, however, claims that the prosecutor’s argument was\nprejudicial because the jury sent a note asking the trial judge whether multiple terms for\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 36\n\n\nthe murders would be served concurrently or consecutively, and it deliberated for 13\nhours, allegedly showing that the jury was considering a life sentence. But, as the TCCA\nnoted, the prosecutor made his “reward” argument about both of Angela’s daughters, yet\nthe jury sentenced Black to death for only Lakeisha’s murder. Moreover, Black’s death\nsentence was supported by six aggravating factors. We therefore agree that Black has\nnot shown a reasonable probability that, but for the prosecutor’s reward argument, the\nresult of his penalty phase would have been different.\n\nF.     Instructing the jury regarding Black’s parole eligibility\n\n       Finally, Black argues that the trial court violated his due process rights by failing\nto answer the jury’s questions regarding how long a life sentence actually was in\nTennessee, and whether he could be paroled from a life sentence. Black contends that\nhe had a due process right to have the jury receive instructions in response to these\nquestions so that he could rebut the prosecution’s improper argument that a life sentence\nwould reward Black for the murders of Latoya and Lakeisha.\n\n       In support of this argument, Black cites Gardner v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109622\"><a href=\"/opinion/109622/gardner-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977),\nSkipper v.

But none of these cases dealt\nwith the type of prosecutorial-misconduct argument that Black raises here. Gardner\ninvolved a defendant’s right to rebut information contained in a presentence report. And\nSkipper concerned a defendant’s right to offer evidence of his good behavior in prison\nin order to rebut the prosecution’s arguments regarding the defendant’s future\ndangerousness.\n\n       Simmons and Shafer provide the closest analogy to the present case. In Simmons,\nthe Court held that “where a defendant’s future dangerousness is at issue, and state law\nprohibits the defendant’s release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury\nbe informed that the defendant is not eligible for parole.” Black, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 870.\nBut if “parole is an option for a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment, . . . the\nSimmons Court emphasized that it will not second-guess the refusal of a State to allow\nproof, instruction, or argument to the jury on the availability of parole.” State v. Bush,\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v.

And, as the district court\nexplained, “[b]ecause Tennessee is a state in which defendants sentenced to life\nimprisonment are eligible for parole, . . . Simmons does not require that the jury be given\ninformation about parole availability.” Black, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 870 (citing Bush, 942\nS.W. 2d at 503).\n\n       In fact, Shafer itself explains that Simmons does not apply where, as here, the\ndefendant might be eligible for parole based on the jury’s decision. Shafer, 532 U.S. at\n51 (“Simmons applies where[,] as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole if the\njury decides the appropriate sentence is life in prison.” (emphasis and internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Moreover, Black does not contend that the prosecutor’s reward\nargument put his dangerousness at issue. We therefore agree with the district court’s\ndenial of Black’s claim that he had a due process right to have the trial court answer the\njury’s questions regarding his parole eligibility and the length of his sentence.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of\nBlack’s habeas petition regarding his non-Atkins claims, VACATE the court’s judgment\nregarding the denial of Black’s petition concerning his Atkins claim, and REMAND the\ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644          Black v.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1044035\"><a href=\"/opinion/1044035/colemen-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn.\n2011)—decided after oral argument in this case—the Tennessee Supreme Court\nconstrued a Tennessee statute prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded defendants\nunder Tennessee law. The panel remands Black’s case to the district court in light of\nColeman, reasoning that Coleman “elucidates Tennessee’s interpretation of Atkins’s\nlegal standard.” See Maj. Op. at p. 14. A thorough reading of Coleman reveals no such\nelucidation. Coleman is purely a construction of a state statute that makes only fleeting\nreferences to Atkins. For this reason, I cannot join the panel, and respectfully dissent.\n\n                                               A\n\n        There are three major flaws with the panel’s opinion.\n\n        First, the panel contends that it is appropriate to “look to state law that has been\nissued after the defendant’s state conviction has become final in order to determine how\nAtkins applies to the specific case at hand.” This position, while correct in the abstract,\nis not supported by the two precedents cited. In Hill v. Anderson, this court remanded\nHill’s Atkins habeas claim to the Ohio state courts—in which Hill had not yet exhausted\nhis “retardation claim”—to allow the courts to “develop [their] own procedures for\ndetermining whether a particular claimant is retarded and ineligible for death.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778778\"><a href=\"/opinion/778778/danny-hill-v-carl-anderson-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682 (6th Cir. 2002). Hill, decided in the uncertain aftermath of Atkins, has no\nbearing on this case. Black has had ample opportunity to exhaust and has exhausted his\nAtkins claim in state courts, and in federal courts. To the extent that Coleman has any\nbearing on Black’s case, the appropriate forum to relitigate such a claim is in state court,\nnot on remand to a federal district court.\n\n        The other case cited, Wiley v. Epps, is readily distinguishable, in light of the Fifth\nCircuit’s finding that AEDPA deference was unwarranted where the “case was\nintertwined with the alleged due process violation by the state court's failure to conduct\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644         Black v. Bell                                        Page 39\n\n\na hearing.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (5th Cir. 2010). “Wiley was convicted before Atkins was\ndecided” and on collateral review was not offered an evidentiary hearing to develop his\nclaim of mental retardation. Ibid. As such, a remand was appropriate to afford Wiley an\nopportunity to state his Atkins claim. Id. at 213 (“[I]t was an unreasonable application\nof clearly established federal law for the Mississippi Supreme Court to deny Wiley’s\nAtkins claim without a hearing, and the district court correctly concluded that it was not\nbound to afford the state court's decision deference.”). In contrast, as the majority notes,\nthe state trial court “held an evidentiary hearing, but ultimately determined that Black\n[was] not mentally retarded under the Atkins standard.” See Maj. Op. at p. 4. Black has\nhad numerous opportunities to argue his Atkins claim, and the state court’s determination\nis entitled to deference. Coleman, a creature of state law, does nothing to implicate his\nAtkins claim.\n\n                                              B\n\n        Second, the state law in question, enacted in 1990, has nothing to do with Atkins\nand its resulting jurisprudence, other than the fact that it relates to the execution of\nmentally retarded individuals. Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-203(a) prohibits the execution\nof an individual with an “intellectual disability” specifically defined as “[s]ignificantly\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning as evidenced by a functional intelligence\nquotient (I.Q.) of seventy (70) or below.” The Tennessee Supreme Court announced in\nVan Tran v. State that the execution of mentally retarded individuals also violated the\nTennessee Constitution. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060419\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060419/van-tran-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 812 (Tenn. 2001). Noteworthy for our purposes,\nVan Tran was decided seven months before the Supreme Court’s opinion in Atkins v.\nVirginia, but after certiorari was granted. Id. at 800. The Coleman opinion itself\ndiscusses Atkins only in the background section. The Tennessee Supreme Court’s\nanalysis in Coleman—which contains only fleeting references to journal articles about\nAtkins—focuses on “construing [the state] statute,” Coleman, at 241. Coleman offers\nno “elucidation” of Atkins.\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644        Black v. Bell                                       Page 40\n\n\n                                             C\n\n       Third, and perhaps most importantly, even assuming that Coleman explicated\nAtkins, such analysis would be of no moment for purposes of AEDPA. Although “Atkins\nreserved for the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the\nconstitutional restriction,” In re Bowling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791801\"><a href=\"/opinion/791801/in-re-thomas-clyde-bowling-jr-movant-04-6194-thomas-clyde-bowling/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436-37 (6th Cir. 2005), the\nmajority is incorrect in reasoning that Coleman “enforce[s] the constitutional\nrestriction.” The Tennessee Supreme Court in Van Tran went out of its way to stress that\nits opinion—issued seven months before Atkins—was grounded on state, and not federal\nconstitutional law. 66 S.W.3d at 801 (“Accordingly, although we will refer to relevant\nanalysis under the Eighth Amendment, all of our opinions and conclusions with respect\nto the execution of mentally retarded individuals—an issue of first impression for this\nCourt—are separately and independently based upon article I, § 16 of the Tennessee\nConstitution.”). Indeed, even if the Tennessee Supreme Court did rely on an\ninterpretation of Atkins, it could not alter or elucidate the relevant AEDPA\ninquiry—which is what was “clearly established federal law” as of 2006, when the\n“TCCA affirmed” the state trial court’s decision that “Black is not mentally retarded\nunder the Atkins standard.” See Maj. Op. at p. 4.\n\n       The majority’s remand cannot be reconciled with this court’s limited role under\nAEDPA to grant relief only for an “unreasonable applications of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1)(emphasis added). See Bobby v. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"616807\"><a href=\"/opinion/616807/bobby-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011) (per curiam).\nColeman decided how a Tennessee state statute should apply to a Tennessee state court\nopinion decided under the Tennessee state Constitution. This case was not decided based\non the Federal Constitution, and does not implicate Black’s federal habeas challenge.\nAEDPA forecloses consideration of this state court precedent as a ground for relief.\n\n                                      *      *   *\n\n       I find no possibility that a federal court’s consideration of Coleman could afford\nBlack any remedy. Remand is unnecessary, inappropriate, and flatly contrary to federal\nlaw. Just as Coleman did, Black can seek relief under this new precedent in Tennessee\n\fNos. 02-5032; 08-5644        Black v. Bell                                      Page 41\n\n\nstate courts “in the form of a motion to re-open his prior post-conviction petition.”\nColeman, 341 S.W.3d.at 226.\n\n       Because Black’s remedy does not lie in the federal courts, I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
