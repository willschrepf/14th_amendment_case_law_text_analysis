The plaintiffs-appellants in this consolidated\nappeal are non-profit entities affiliated with the Catholic Church who have religious objections to\ncertain preventive care standards under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nSpecifically, the appellants object to the requirement that their employer-based health insurance\nplans cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraception, sterilization methods, and\ncounseling. All of the appellants are eligible for either an exemption from the requirement or an\naccommodation to the requirement, through which the entities will not pay for the contraceptive\nproducts and services and the coverage will be independently administered by an insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator. Nonetheless, in their complaints filed in the District Courts\nfor the Middle District of Tennessee and Western District of Michigan, the appellants alleged\nthat the contraceptive-coverage requirement violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; the\nFree Speech, Free Exercise, and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment; and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.            Both district courts denied the appellants’ motions for a\n\n\n        *\n          The Honorable John T. Nixon, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.

Factual Background\n\n         The appellants allege that they are Catholic entities that provide “spiritual, educational,\nsocial, and financial services to members of their communities, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.”\nMCC R. 1 (MCC Compl. at ¶ 1) (Page ID #2); CDN R. 1 (CDN Compl. at ¶ 2) (Page ID #2).1\n\n         All appellants currently provide health plans to their employees. Michigan Catholic\nConference (“MCC”) offers a self-insured group health plan that is “administered by separate\nthird party administrators, 2 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Express Scripts.” MCC R.\n1 (Compl. at ¶ 41) (Page ID #13). Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo is a “Covered Unit[]” whose\nemployees may participate in the plan that MCC offers its employees. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at\n¶¶ 41, 50–51) (Page ID #13, 15). The remaining appellants—the Catholic Diocese of Nashville\n(“CDN”);3 Catholic Charities of Tennessee, Inc. (“Catholic Charities of Tennessee”); Camp\nMarymount, Inc. (“Camp Marymount”); Mary, Queen of Angels, Inc. (“MQA”); St. Mary Villa,\nInc. (“St. Mary Villa”); Aquinas College; and Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia Congregation\n(“St. Cecilia Congregation”)—offer fully-insured group health plans.4 CDN R. 1 (Compl. at\n¶¶ 43, 61, 71, 79, 80, 107, 129) (Page ID #13, 17, 19, 20, 25, 30).\n\n\n\n         1\n        MCC R. refers to documents in Michigan Catholic Conference et al. v. Burwell et al., No. 13-2723, and\nCDN R. refers to documents in Catholic Diocese of Nashville et al. v. Burwell et al., No. 13-6640.\n         2\n           “A self-insured plan is one in which benefits are paid from contributions supplied by the employer without\nthe assistance of outside insurance.” 1A Steven Plitt, et al., Couch on Insurance § 10.1 n.1 (3d ed. 2013). “An\nemployer is said to have a ‘self-insured’ plan if [the employer] bears the financial risk of paying claims.”\nGovernment Br. at 7 n.1. Many companies that offer self-insured plans hire an insurance company or other outside\nentity, referred to as a third-party administrator, “to administer their plans, performing functions such as developing\nnetworks of providers, negotiating payment rates, and processing claims.” Id.\n         3\n          CDN offers its employees a choice including a preferred provider option (“PPO plan”) and a high-\ndeductible option. CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 43) (Page ID #13). The PPO plan meets the definition of a\n“grandfathered plan” under the ACA; thus, at this time, that plan is exempt from the contraceptive-coverage\nrequirement. CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 46) (Page ID #13).\n         4\n          “An insured plan, also known as a fully insured plan, is one in which insurance is purchased from a\nregulated insurance company.” 1A Steven Plitt, et al., Couch on Insurance § 10.1 n.1 (3d ed. 2013).\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640       Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 4\n\nMCC, CDN, and St. Cecilia Congregation allege that they are eligible for the total exemption\nfrom the contraceptive-coverage requirement for “religious employers,” meaning that their\nhealth plans need not provide contraceptive coverage. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 9) (Page ID #4);\nCDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 14) (Page ID #7). The remaining appellants allege that they are eligible\nfor the accommodation for certain religiously affiliated non-profits. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 11)\n(Page ID #5); CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 10) (Page ID #5).\n\n                                    Regulatory Background\n\n       The enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) in 2010\nestablished new minimum standards requiring employer-based group health plans and health\ninsurance issuers to cover certain services without cost-sharing through a deductible or other\npayment by the plan participant or beneficiary. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. The term “group health\nplan” is broadly defined to include both insured group health plans and self-insured group health\nplans: “[t]he term ‘group health plan’ means an employee welfare benefit plan . . . to the extent\nthat the plan provides medical care (as defined in paragraph (2)) and including items and services\npaid for as medical care) to employees or their dependents (as defined under the terms of the\nplan) directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).\nCongressional hearings emphasized the importance of coverage without cost-sharing for\nwomen’s specific healthcare needs because “women have different health needs than men, and\nthese needs often generate additional costs.” 155 Cong. Rec. 29049, 29070 (Dec. 2, 2009)\n(statement of Sen. Feinstein). “Women of childbearing age spent 68 percent more in out-of-\npocket health care costs than men.” Id. Additionally, the legislative debates recognized that\nmedical costs disproportionately discourage women from seeking treatment: “[w]omen are more\nlikely than men to neglect care or treatment because of cost.” 155 Cong. Rec. S11985, S11987\n(daily ed. Nov. 30. 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski). The enacted law thus required coverage\nfor, “with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for\nin comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.”\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4); see also Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating\nto Coverage of Preventive Services under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640             Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                  Page 5\n\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725-01, 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590; 45 C.F.R. pt.\n147).\n\n        For assistance in developing the guidelines for covered “preventive care and screenings,”\nid., the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) asked the Institute of Medicine\n(“IOM”) to bring together a committee to “conduct a review of effective preventive services to\nensure women’s health and well-being.” IOM, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing\nthe Gaps (“Closing the Gaps”) (2011), 1.5 “The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970\nby the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate\nprofessions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public.” Id. at iv.\nThe members of the Committee on Preventive Services for Women (“Committee”) included\n“specialists in disease prevention, women’s health issues, adolescent health issues, and evidence-\nbased guidelines.” Id. at 2. The Committee recommended preventive measures that “met the\nfollowing criteria:\n\n        ●          The condition to be prevented affects a broad population;\n        ●          The condition to be prevented has a large potential impact on health and\n                   well-being; and\n        ●          The quality and strength of the evidence is supportive.\n\nId. at 8. The Committee made eight recommendations6 for preventive services for women,\nincluding coverage for “the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive\nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with\nreproductive capacity.” Id. at 10; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725. This recommendation was\nbased on the Committee’s concern about the high rate of unintended pregnancy in the United\nStates; forty-nine percent of pregnancies in 2001 “were unintended—defined as unwanted or\nmistimed at the time of conception,” a rate much higher than comparable developed countries.\nClosing the Gaps at 102. The rate of unintended pregnancy “is more likely among women who\nare aged 18 to 24 years and unmarried, who have a low income, who are not high school\ngraduates, and who are members of a racial or ethnic minority group.” Id. The Committee\n\n        5\n          The report may be read online for free at:         http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Clinical-Preventive-\nServices-for-Women-Closing-the-Gaps.aspx.\n        6\n            One of the sixteen members of the Committee, Anthony Lo Sasso, dissented from the report.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640          Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                  Page 6\n\nconcluded that contraceptive coverage would greatly decrease the risk of unwanted pregnancies,\nadverse pregnancy outcomes, and other negative health consequences, and significantly reduce\nwomen’s medical costs.          Id. at 102–07.        The regulations promulgated by the agencies\nimplementing the ACA required group health plans and insurance issuers offering group or\nindividual health insurance coverage to provide coverage without cost-sharing for preventive\ncare and screenings provided for in guidelines supported by the HRSA.                        See 26 C.F.R.\n§ 54.9815-2713A (Tax); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A (Labor); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131 (Health and\nHuman Services).7\n\n        The regulations provide for a religious-employer exemption from the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement and an accommodation for certain non-profits that do not qualify for the\nexemption but that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds. The government first\ndeveloped the religious-employer exemption, under which HRSA is authorized to “establish an\nexemption . . . with respect to a group health plan established or maintained by a religious\nemployer (and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan\nestablished or maintained by a religious employer) with respect to any requirement to cover\ncontraceptive services under such guidelines.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). A “religious employer”\nis defined as “an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred\nto in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a); see 26 U.S.C. §§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii) (referring to “churches, their\nintegrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches” and “the exclusively\nreligious activities of any religious order.”).\n\n        Based on objections that the religious-employer exemption as borrowed from the Tax\nCode was drawn too narrowly, the government developed a special accommodation for certain\nnon-profits. The accommodation was intended to “meet two goals—providing contraceptive\ncoverage without cost-sharing to individuals who want it and accommodating non-exempted,\nnon-profit organizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive services.” 77 Fed. Reg.\n\n\n        7\n         The Department of Treasury, Department of Labor, and Department of Health and Human Services\npromulgated identical regulations regarding the framework. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A; 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131. For the sake of simplicity, we cite only the Department of Labor regulations.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640         Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 7\n\nat 8727. The final regulations permitted “eligible organization[s]” to obtain the accommodation\nif the organization “satisfies all of the following requirements:\n\n       (1)     The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n               contraceptive services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on\n               account of religious objections.\n       (2)     The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity.\n       (3)     The organization holds itself out as a religious organization.\n       (4)     The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by the\n               Secretary, that it satisfies the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of\n               this section, and makes such self-certification available for examination\n               upon request[.]\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b).\n\n       The process by which an organization obtains the exemption and the accommodation will\nbe discussed as relevant to the appellants’ claims.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n       MCC and Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo (together, “MCC plaintiffs”) filed suit in the\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Michigan on November 14, 2013. CDN, Catholic\nCharities of Tennessee, Camp Marymount, MQA, St. Mary Villa, St. Cecilia Congregation, and\nAquinas College (together, “CDN plaintiffs”) filed suit in the District Court for the Middle\nDistrict of Tennessee on November 22, 2013.             Both sets of plaintiffs alleged that the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; the Free\nExercise, Free Speech, and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.        In November 2013, the plaintiffs moved for preliminary\ninjunctions in their respective district courts. The District Court for the Western District of\nMichigan denied a preliminary injunction on all claims because the plaintiffs had not shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claims. Michigan Catholic Conference v. Sebelius\nNo. 1:13-CV-1247, 2013 WL 6838707, at *13 (W.D. Mich. Dec. 27, 2013). The District Court\nfor the Middle District of Tennessee held that the plaintiffs waived their claims under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, and denied a preliminary injunction on all other claims because\nthe plaintiffs had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.

Sebelius, No. 3:13-01303, 2013 WL 6834375, at *4–10 (M.D. Tenn.\nDec. 26, 2013).\n\nThe appellants now appeal the denials of their motions for a preliminary injunction.\n\n                                         II. ANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       As we recently stated in a unanimous en banc decision, there are:\n\n       four factors [the district court] must balance when considering a motion for\n       preliminary injunction: (1) whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success\n       on the merits; (2) whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury without the\n       injunction; (3) whether issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to\n       others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuance of the\n       injunction. When a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the basis of a\n       potential constitutional violation, the likelihood of success on the merits often will\n       be the determinative factor. Whether the movant is likely to succeed on the\n       merits is a question of law we review de novo. We review for abuse of discretion,\n       however, the district court’s ultimate determination as to whether the four\n       preliminary injunction factors weigh in favor of granting or denying preliminary\n       injunctive relief. This standard is deferential, but the court may reverse the\n       district court if it improperly applied the governing law, used an erroneous legal\n       standard, or relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact.\n\nCity of Pontiac Retired Emps.

May 5, 2014) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). “The party seeking\na preliminary injunction bears a burden of justifying such relief, including showing irreparable\nharm and likelihood of success.” McNeilly v. Land, 684 F.3d 611, 615 (6th Cir. 2012).\n\nB. Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n\n       The appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement violates the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) because it imposes a substantial burden on their exercise of\nreligion by forcing them to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to insurance coverage for\ncontraception, and the contraceptive-coverage requirement is not the least restrictive means to\nfurther a compelling government interest. Both district courts concluded that the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement does not impose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion because\nthe plaintiffs were eligible for either the exemption or the accommodation from the requirement.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640           Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                   Page 9\n\n        To analyze properly the appellants’ claim under RFRA, we begin with the genesis of the\nlaw. In Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), the Court held that if a state law survived\nconstitutional challenge, it would be “because any incidental burden on the free exercise of\nappellant’s religion may be justified by a ‘compelling state interest in the regulation of a subject\nwithin the State’s constitutional power to regulate . . . .” Id. at 403 (quoting NAACP v. Button,\n371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963)).            The Supreme Court rejected the compelling-interest test in\nEmployment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872\n(1990), stating that:\n\n        The government’s ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially\n        harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, cannot\n        depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious\n        objector’s spiritual development. To make an individual’s obligation to obey\n        such a law contingent upon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs,\n        except where the State’s interest is compelling—permitting him, by virtue of his\n        beliefs, to become a law unto himself—contradicts both constitutional tradition\n        and common sense.\n\nId. at 884–85 (quotation marks and internal citations omitted).                     In “direct response” to\nEmployment Division v. Smith, Congress enacted RFRA. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507,\n512 (1997). RFRA’s stated purposes are:\n\n        (1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner,\n        374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) and to\n        guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is\n        substantially burdened; and\n        (2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is\n        substantially burdened by government.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b). Under RFRA, the government may not “substantially burden a person’s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless the\ngovernment demonstrates that application of the burden “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling\ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\ngovernmental interest.” 8 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1(a), (b).\n\n\n        8\n          As a preliminary matter, we note two questions that have not been raised by the parties in this case and\nthat, because we conclude that the contraceptive-coverage requirement does not violate RFRA, we need not address.\nFirst, whether the appellants, all of whom are non-profit corporations, are “persons” capable of the “exercise of\nreligion” within the meaning of RFRA. Second, whether RFRA applies to a later-enacted statute. RFRA contains\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 10\n\nWe follow a two-step process for analyzing RFRA claims:\n\n         First, the plaintiff must make out a prima facie case by establishing Article III\n         standing and showing that the law in question would (1) substantially burden (2) a\n         sincere (3) religious exercise. If the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, it falls\n         to the government to demonstrate[ ] that application of the burden to the person\n         (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\n         restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. The\n         government carries the burdens of both production and persuasion when it seeks\n         to justify a substantial burden on a sincere religious practice.\n\nAutocam Corp. v. Sebelius, 730 F.3d 618, 625 (6th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). “Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct\nproscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by\nreligious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to\nviolate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Emp’t Sec.\nDiv., 450 U.S. 707, 717–18 (1981). But a government action does not constitute a substantial\nburden on the exercise of religion even if “the challenged Government action would interfere\nsignificantly with private persons’ ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own\nreligious beliefs” if the governmental action does not coerce the individuals to violate their\nreligious beliefs or deny them the “rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.”\nLyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 449 (1988).\n\n\n\n\nan express-reference requirement providing that “[f]ederal statutory law adopted after November 16, 1993 is subject\nto this chapter unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this chapter.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-3(b). Essentially, RFRA purports to bind all later Congresses unless they specifically reject the\napplication of RFRA by the means specified by the earlier Congress that enacted RFRA. The Supreme Court has\nquestioned the binding effect of express-reference requirements. Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 310 (1955)\n(refusing “to require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from” a\npreviously enacted statute). In Dorsey v. United States, the Court treated a savings statute with an express-reference\nrequirement as:\n         in effect a less demanding interpretive requirement. That is because statutes enacted by one\n         Congress cannot bind a later Congress, which remains free to repeal the earlier statute, to exempt\n         the current statute from the earlier statute, to modify the earlier statute, or to apply the earlier\n         statute but as modified. And Congress remains free to express any such intention either expressly\n         or by implication as it chooses.\n--U.S.--, 132 S. Ct. 2321, 2331 (2012) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). See also Lockhart v. United States,\n546 U.S. 142, 149–50 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring) (identifying RFRA as a statute with an express-reference\nrequirement and remarking that “it does no favor to the Members of Congress, and to those who assist in drafting\ntheir legislation, to keep secret the fact that such express-reference provisions are ineffective.”). Thus, Congress\nmay reject the application of RFRA to a later-enacted statute without explicitly stating that RFRA does not apply.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640           Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.        Page 11\n\n        The exercise of religion that appellants argue is burdened by the contraceptive-coverage\nrequirement is their “refus[al] to take certain actions in furtherance of a regulatory scheme to\nprovide their employees with coverage for abortion-inducing products, contraceptives,\nsterilization, and related education and counseling.” Appellant Br. at 26–27. The government\ndoes not dispute that the appellants’ desire not to participate in the provision of contraception is a\nsincere religious belief.\n\n        The government does argue, however, that the contraceptive-coverage requirement does\nnot impose a substantial burden on the appellants’ exercise of religion. Because the appellants\nall concede that they are eligible for either the exemption or the accommodation, they need not\nactually participate in the contraceptive-coverage requirement. Government Br. at 18–19. The\nappellants respond that the exemption and accommodation do not alleviate the burden of the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement because the process to obtain the exemption or\naccommodation forces the appellants “to play an integral role in the delivery of objectionable\nproducts and services to their employees.” Appellant Br. at 27–29.\n\n        First, we must address the appellants’ argument that the court should defer to their\nconclusion that the exemption and accommodation arrangement forces them to provide, pay for,\nand/or facilitate access to contraceptive coverage. See Appellant Br. at 18–20 (describing the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the contraceptive-coverage requirement imposes a burden on third\nparties, not the appellants, as a “foray into the theology behind Catholic precepts on\ncontraception [that] was manifestly improper”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Appellant Br.\nat 36 (“Whether the accommodation relieves Appellants of moral culpability for their actions\n(i.e., allows them to opt out) or makes them complicit in a grave moral wrong is a question of\nreligious conscience for [Appellants] to decide.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).            Put\nanother way, the appellants appear to ask the court to defer not only to their belief that requesting\nthe exemption or the accommodation makes them complicit in sin, but also to defer to their\nunderstanding of how the regulatory measure actually works.\n\n        But as was recently explained, “there is nothing about RFRA or First Amendment\njurisprudence that requires the Court to accept plaintiffs’ characterization of the regulatory\nscheme on its face.” Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. Sebelius, --F. Supp. 2d--, No.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.           Page 12\n\n13-1441, 2013 WL 6729515, at *14 (D.D.C. Dec. 20, 2013), injunction granted pending appeal,\nNo. 13-5371 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 31, 2013)). Although we are in no position to determine the moral\nor theological consequences of appellants requesting the exemption or accommodation, we must\ndetermine the legal consequences. Whether a government obligation substantially burdens the\nexercise of religion is a question of law, not a “question[] of fact, proven by the credibility of the\nclaimant.” Mahoney v. Doe, 642 F.3d 1112, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). We “accept[ ] as true the\nfactual allegations that [appellants’] beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature—but not the\nlegal conclusion, cast as a factual allegation, that [their] religious exercise is substantially\nburdened.” Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 679 (D.C Cir. 2008). Thus, although we\nacknowledge that the appellants believe that the regulatory framework makes them complicit in\nthe provision of contraception, we will independently determine what the regulatory provisions\nrequire and whether they impose a substantial burden on appellants’ exercise of religion.\n\n       1. Appellants Eligible for the Exemption\n\n       MCC, CDN, and St. Cecilia Congregation allege that they are eligible for the religious-\nemployer exemption from the contraceptive-coverage requirement. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 9)\n(Page ID #4); CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 14) (Page ID #7). The government agrees that these three\nappellants are “exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement under 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(a).” Government Br. at 9–10, 18; see also Government Br. at 13. The appellants do\nnot object to any specific act that they must engage in to obtain the exemption. Indeed, the\ngovernment states that these “[p]laintiffs are . . . already exempt from the requirement to provide\ncontraceptive coverage.” Government Br. at 13. Because both parties agree that MCC, CDN,\nand St. Cecilia Congregation are eligible for the exemption and because the appellants do not\nidentify any particular action that they must take to obtain the exemption that burdens their\nexercise of religion, appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the\nmerits of this claim.\n\n       2. Appellants Eligible for the Accommodation\n\n       The contraceptive-coverage framework does not impose a burden on the exercise of\nreligion by those remaining appellants who are eligible for the accommodation. If an entity has\nan insured group health insurance plan, all that the entity must do to obtain the accommodation is\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 13\n\n“furnish[] a copy of the self-certification . . . to each issuer that would otherwise provide such\ncoverage in connection with the group health plan.”9 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1). If an\nentity has a self-insured plan, such as Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo, all that the entity must do\nto obtain the accommodation is “[c]ontract with one or more third party administrators”10 and\n“provide[] each third party administrator that will process claims for any contraceptive services11\n. . . with a copy of the self-certification.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(i), (ii). That is the\nentirety of the conduct that the objecting organization must engage in to obtain the\naccommodation.\n\n         The appellants are not required to “provide” contraceptive coverage.                        They are not\nrequired physically to distribute contraception to their employees upon request, and the eligible\norganization’s health plan does not host the coverage. Upon receipt of the self-certification\nform, the insurance issuer “must—(A) Expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group\nhealth insurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan.”                            29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(i)(A). In the self-insured context, the self-certification form declares to\nthe third-party administrator that “[t]he eligible organization will not act as the plan\nadministrator or claims administrator with respect to claims for contraceptive services.”\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(A).                Instead, the third-party administrator “shall be\nresponsible for . . . compliance with” the preventive care and screenings provided for in the\nHRSA guidelines.          29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b), (b)(1) (referencing obligations in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300gg-13 and 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)). Thus, although the insurance issuer or\nthird-party administrator will provide contraceptive coverage, the appellants will not.\n\n\n\n\n         9\n          Nothing in the record indicates that any of the insurance issuers with which the appellants contract has\nrefused to provide contraceptive coverage upon receipt of a self-certification form.\n         10\n            Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo, the only appellant alleging that it is eligible for the accommodation and\nhas a self-insured plan, already contracts with a third-party administrator. This appellant participates in the MCC\nPlan, “which consists of self-funded medical and prescription benefits administered by separate third party\nadministrators, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Express Scripts, respectively.” MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶¶ 41,\n50) (Page ID #13, 15).\n         11\n            Nothing in the record indicates that Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo’s third-party administrator has\nrefused to provide contraceptive coverage upon receipt of a self-certification form.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 14\n\n       The appellants are not required to “pay for” contraceptive coverage. When an insurance\nissuer receives the self-certification form, it “must . . . Provide separate payments for any\ncontraceptive services.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(i)(B). The eligible organization’s\nmoney will not fund the contraceptive coverage: “[t]he issuer must segregate premium revenue\ncollected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for\ncontraceptive services.”      29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(ii).          When a third-party\nadministrator receives the self-certification form, it must “provide or arrange payments for\ncontraceptive services” either by providing the payments itself or arranging for an issuer or\nanother entity to provide the payments. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2)(i), (ii). In either\nsituation, whoever is providing the payments may not “impose[] a premium, fee, or other charge,\nor any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan,\nor plan participants or beneficiaries.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2)(i), (ii); (c)(2)(ii). The\naccommodated entity does not even need to be the one to tell the employees about the\ncontraceptive coverage. The regulations require the insurance issuer or third-party administrator\nto provide written notice to plan participants and beneficiaries “specify[ing] that the eligible\norganization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third party\nadministrator or issuer, as applicable, provides separate payments for contraceptive services.”\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d). Thus, although the insurance issuer or third-party administrator\nwill pay for contraceptive coverage, the appellants will not.\n\n       Moreover, the appellants are not required to “facilitate access to” contraceptive coverage.\nThe crux of the appellants’ “facilitation” argument is that providing the self-certification form to\nthe insurance issuer or third-party administrator “triggers” the provision of the contraceptive\ncoverage to their employees. Appellant Br. at 9, 27–31. This argument rests on two assumptions\nthat are, perhaps, two sides of the same coin: first, that the insurance issuer and third-party\nadministrator could not provide the coverage until they receive a self-certification form and\nsecond, that the insurance issuer and third-party administrator then provide the coverage because\nthey received the self-certification form.\n\n       Submitting the self-certification form to the insurance issuer or third-party administrator\ndoes not “trigger” contraceptive coverage; it is federal law that requires the insurance issuer or\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 15\n\nthe third-party administrator to provide this coverage. The ACA requires “[a] group health\nplan12 and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage” to\n“provide coverage for . . . with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings\n. . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg-13(a), (a)(4). Thus, under the ACA, the appellants’ health\nplans and insurance issuers must provide contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing, whether\nor not the appellants decide to self-certify. “Federal law, not the religious organization’s signing\nand mailing the form, requires health-care insurers, along with third-party administrators of self-\ninsured health plans, to cover contraceptive services.” Univ. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554.\n“Because Congress has imposed an independent obligation on insurers to provide contraceptive\ncoverage to Appellants’ employees, those employees will receive contraceptive coverage from\ntheir insurers even if Appellants self-certify—but not because Appellants self-certify.” Roman\nCatholic Archbishop of Washington v. Sebelius, No. 13-5371; Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of\nHealth and Human Servs., No. 13-5368 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 31, 2013) (Tatel, J., dissenting from\ninjunction pending appeal). The obligation to cover contraception will not be triggered by the\nact of self-certification—it already was triggered by the enactment of the ACA.\n\n         The appellants allege that providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to\ncontraceptive coverage burdens their exercise of religion. As discussed supra, the exemption\nand accommodation framework does not require them to do any of these things. The framework\ndoes not permit them to prevent their insurance issuer or third-party administrator from\nproviding contraceptive coverage to their employees pursuant to independent obligations under\nfederal law. However, the inability to “restrain the behavior of a third party that conflicts with\nthe [appellants’] religious beliefs,” Michigan Catholic Conference, 2013 WL 6838707, at *7,\ndoes not impose a burden on the appellants’ exercise of religion. “[W]hile a religious institution\nhas broad immunity from being required to engage in acts that violate the tenets of its faith, it has\n\n\n\n         12\n           Group health plan is broadly defined and includes both insured group health plans and self-insured group\nhealth plans: “[t]he term ‘group health plan’ means an employee welfare benefit plan . . . to the extent that the plan\nprovides medical care (as defined in paragraph (2)) and including items and services paid for as medical care) to\nemployees or their dependents (as defined under the terms of the plan) directly or through insurance, reimbursement,\nor otherwise.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 16\n\nno right to prevent other institutions, whether the government or a health insurance company,\nfrom engaging in acts that merely offend the institution.” Univ. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 552.\n\n       The government’s imposition of an independent obligation on a third party does not\nimpose a substantial burden on the appellants’ exercise of religion. In Bowen v. Roy, a pre-Smith\nFree Exercise case, the Supreme Court rejected a Free Exercise claim against the government’s\nuse of a Native American child’s Social Security number. The father of the child “believe[d] the\nuse of the number may harm his daughter’s spirit.” 476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986). The Court\nconcluded that the Free Exercise Clause did not allow an individual to force the Government to\nconform its conduct to the individual’s religious beliefs. “Never to our knowledge has the Court\ninterpreted the First Amendment to require the Government itself to behave in ways that the\nindividual believes will further his or her spiritual development or that of his or her family.” Id.\nThe family “may not demand that the Government join in their chosen religious practices . . . .\nAs a result, Roy may no more prevail on his religious objection to the Government’s use of a\nSocial Security number for his daughter than he could on a sincere religious objection to the size\nor color of the Government’s filing cabinets.” Id. at 700. Just as the government’s use of the\nchild’s Social Security number “does not itself in any degree impair [the family’s] ‘freedom to\nbelieve, express, and exercise[e]’ [their] religion,” id., the Government’s instruction to insurance\nissuers and third-party administrators to provide contraceptive coverage does not force the\nappellants to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to the coverage.\n\n       Similarly, in Kaemmerling v. Lappin the D.C. Circuit rejected a RFRA claim because the\nchallenged government action did not require anything of the challenger. A prisoner expressed\nreligious objections to the government collecting and analyzing his DNA profile pursuant to the\nDNA Act. 553 F.3d 669, 678–79 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The court held that the prisoner “cannot\nidentify any ‘exercise’ which is the subject of the burden to which he objects” because the\ngovernmental process of extracting DNA “involves no action or forbearance on [the prisoner’s]\npart, nor does it otherwise interfere with any religious act in which he engages.” Id. at 679.\nHere, the only thing that the exemption and accommodation framework requires of the appellants\nis conduct in which they already engage. They will continue to sponsor health plans, contract\nwith insurance issuers or third-party administrators, and declare their opposition to providing\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 17\n\ncontraceptive coverage to their insurance issuer and third-party administrator.           Michigan\nCatholic Conference, 2013 WL 6838707, at *7. The only difference in conduct is on the part of\nthe insurance issuer or third-party administrator; appellants “are not required to ‘modify [their]\nbehavior.’ Rather, it is the TPA [or insurance issuer] that is required to modify its behavior and\ntake action by providing contraceptive services—without the assistance of” the appellant. Id.\nEmployees and beneficiaries will receive contraceptive coverage, but that coverage will be\n“despite plaintiffs’ religious objections, not because of them.” Government Br. at 26. Again, the\ninsurance issuers and third-party administrators are not parties to this suit and have not expressed\nany opposition to complying with the contraceptive-coverage requirement. The fact that the\nregulations require the insurance issuers and third-party administrators to modify their behavior\ndoes not demonstrate a substantial burden on the appellants.\n\n        In addition to the objection to the self-certification form, the appellants raise various\nprocedural objections to the accommodation framework, none of which is meritorious. The\nappellants object to having to offer enrollment paperwork to allow employees to enroll in the\nplan overseen by the third party and to sending health-plan enrollment paperwork to the third\nparty. Appellant Br. at 29. The regulations do not require either of these acts; the regulations\nspecifically provide that the third-party administrator or insurance issuer (not the accommodated\neligible organization) notifies plan participants and beneficiaries of the availability of payments\nfor contraceptive services. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 2590.715-2713A(d). The appellants object to\nhaving to “[i]dentify for a third party which of their employees will participate in the plan.”\nAppellant Br. at 29. Again, this is not required by the regulations. Moreover, because these\nappellants already contract with insurance issuers and third-party administrators, the insurance\nissuers and third-party administrators presumably already have lists of plan participants and\nbeneficiaries. Finally, the appellants object to having to “[r]efrain from canceling their insurance\narrangement with a third party authorized to provide the objectionable products and services.”\nAppellant Br. at 29. Once again, the regulations do not prohibit the appellants from canceling an\ninsurance arrangement, and the appellants have not expressed any actual intent to do so.\nBecause these objections do not go to actual requirements of the contraceptive-coverage\nframework, they clearly do not demonstrate a substantial burden on appellants’ exercise of\nreligion.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 18\n\n       The appellants argue that the exemption and accommodation mechanism pressures them\nto modify their behavior and violate their religious beliefs because previously they informed\ntheir insurance issuer or third-party administrator of their opposition to contraception and those\nentities did not cover contraception, but now they will inform their insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator of their opposition and those entities will cover contraception. But that is an\nobjection to the later independent action of a third party, not to an obligation imposed on the\nappellants by the government. It is not the act of self-certification that causes the insurance\nissuer and the third-party administrator to cover contraception, it is the law of the United States\nthat does that. Self-certification allows the eligible organization to tell the insurance issuer and\nthird-party administrator “‘we’re excused from the new federal obligation relating to\ncontraception,’ and in turn, the government tells those insurance companies, ‘but you’re not.’”\nUniv. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 557. Perhaps the appellants would like to retain the authority\nto prevent their insurance issuer or third-party administrator from providing contraceptive\ncoverage to appellants’ employees, but “RFRA is not a mechanism to advance a generalized\nobjection to a governmental policy choice, even if it is one sincerely based upon religion.”\nRoman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, 2013 WL 6729515, at *2.\n\n       Because these appellants may obtain the accommodation from the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement without providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to contraception,\nthe contraceptive-coverage requirement does not impose a substantial burden on these\nappellants’ exercise of religion. Therefore, these appellants have not demonstrated a strong\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their RFRA claim.\n\nC. First Amendment\n       1. Free Speech Clause\n\n       “It is . . . a basic First Amendment principle that freedom of speech prohibits the\ngovernment from telling people what they must say.” Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance for Open\nSoc’y Int’l, Inc., --U.S.--, 133 S. Ct. 2321, 2327 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). “The\ngovernment may not prohibit the dissemination of ideas that it disfavors, nor compel the\nendorsement of ideas that it approves.” Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000, --U.S.--,\n132 S. Ct. 2277, 2288 (2012). The appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 19\n\nviolates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment by forcing them to provide, pay for,\nand/or facilitate access to contraception counseling; forcing them to speak against their beliefs by\nfilling out the self-certification form; and imposing a “gag order” by prohibiting them from\ninterfering with or seeking to influence a third-party administrator’s decision to cover\ncontraception. We conclude that the contraceptive coverage requirement does not violate the\nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and will address each of the subclaims in turn.\n\n               a. Contraceptive counseling\n\n       First, the appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement unconstitutionally\ncompels speech by forcing them to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to counseling about\ncontraception, and that this obligation violates their religious opposition “to providing any\nsupport for ‘counseling’ that encourages, promotes, or facilitates such practices.” Appellant Br.\nat 57–58. The guidelines recommended coverage without cost-sharing for “the full range of\nFood and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and\npatient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.” Closing the Gaps at\n10; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725. Presumably, this counseling would include discussion of the\nrange of contraceptive options, how the various products work, and what may be a good fit for\nthe counseled individual’s health profile and lifestyle.\n\n       The regulations certainly do not require the accommodated entity to “provide” this\ncounseling. The accommodated entity need not discuss or acknowledge the existence of the\ncounseling coverage; the regulations require the insurance issuer or third-party administrator to\ninform plan participants and beneficiaries that separate payments are available for counseling\nand other contraceptive services. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 2590.715-2713A(d). The regulations make\nno attempt to stop the appellants’ practice of “counsel[ing] men and women against” using\ncontraception. Appellant Br. at 57, 58. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional\nRights, Inc. (“FAIR”), 547 U.S. 47, 65 (2006) (upholding a statute against a free-exercise\nchallenge; the statute required law schools to give military recruiters equal access to other\nrecruiters as a condition on receipt of certain federal funds, but “[n]othing about recruiting\nsuggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon\nAmendment restricts what the law schools may say about the military’s policies.”). Thus, in no\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 20\n\nway do the regulations compel the appellants’ speech by forcing them to provide contraceptive\ncounseling.\n\n       The regulations also do not compel the appellants’ speech by forcing them to pay for\ncontraceptive counseling. As discussed supra, the regulations specifically prohibit an insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator from passing on the cost of complying with the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement, which includes the cost of contraceptive counseling. See 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(2), (c)(2).\n\n       Finally, the requirements do not force the appellants to facilitate access to contraceptive\ncounseling. It is not clear what speech, exactly, the appellants believe is compelled by the\nfacilitation of such coverage; in any event, as discussed supra, it is federal law, not the\nappellants’ actions, that requires their insurance issuer or third-party administrator to provide\ninsurance coverage for contraceptive counseling.        The contraceptive coverage is provided\nthrough a government regulation of the insurance issuer and third-party administrator, not\nthrough the appellants’ health insurance plan. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(i)(A)\n(upon receipt of the self-certification form, the insurance issuer “must—(A) Expressly exclude\ncontraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with\nthe group health plan”); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(A) (the self-certification form\ndeclares to the third-party administrator that “[t]he eligible organization will not act as the plan\nadministrator or claims administrator with respect to claims for contraceptive services”). Thus,\nthe framework does not require appellants to “host or accommodate another speaker’s message”\nthrough their insurance plan. FAIR, 547 U.S. at 63; cf. Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian &\nBisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 566 (1995) (requiring a parade organizer to allow\na group whose message it opposes to participate in the parade is unconstitutional forced\naccommodation of speech); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm’n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1,\n20–21 (1986) (plurality opinion) (forcing a utility company to include a third-party\norganization’s newsletter with the utility bill is unconstitutional forced accommodation of\nspeech).\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640       Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 21\n\n       The contraceptive counseling provision does not violate the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment. Thus, appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the\nmerits of this claim.\n\n               b. Self-certification Form\n\n       Second, the appellants argue that the requirement that they complete the self-certification\nform in order to obtain the accommodation “compels Appellants to engage in speech that triggers\nprovision of the objectionable products and services, and [ ] deprives Appellants of the freedom\nto speak on the issue of abortion and contraception on their own terms, at a time and place of\ntheir own choosing, outside of the confines of the Government’s regulatory scheme.” Appellant\nBr. at 58. As discussed supra, the self-certification form does not trigger the provision of\ncontraceptive coverage, but instead it triggers the entities’ disassociation from what they deem to\nbe the objectionable coverage. Thus, this framework is nothing like the unconstitutional state\ncampaign finance law in Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, where\nthe state provided matching funds for publicly financed candidates when a privately financed\ncandidate or independent expenditure group spent over a certain amount on the election, thus\nmaking the privately financed candidate’s political expenditures a trigger of funding to his or her\nadversary. --U.S.--, 131 S. Ct. 2806, 2818 (2011). The self-certification form does not have a\nsimilar triggering function. Additionally, the self-certification form does not deprive appellants\nof the freedom to speak out about abortion and contraception on their own terms. The form\nrequires the appellants to assert their opposition to contraception in order to opt out of a\ngenerally applicable government program. Successful compelled-speech cases are those when\n“an individual is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees with, imposed by the\ngovernment.” Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, 544 U.S. 550, 557 (2005). Even assuming that\nthe government is compelling this speech, it is not speech that the appellants disagree with and\nso cannot be the basis of a First Amendment claim. Thus, the self-certification requirement does\nnot compel speech in violation of the First Amendment, and so the appellants have not\ndemonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 22\n\n                  c. “Gag Order”\n\n         Finally, the appellants argue that the accommodation framework imposes an\nunconstitutional “gag order” by prohibiting eligible organizations with self-insured group plans\nfrom interfering with, or seeking to influence, a third-party administrator’s decision to provide\ncontraceptive coverage. Specifically, the regulation provides:\n\n         The eligible organization must not, directly or indirectly, seek to interfere with a\n         third party administrator’s arrangements to provide or arrange separate payments\n         for contraceptive services for participants or beneficiaries, and must not, directly\n         or indirectly, seek to influence the third party administrator’s decision to make\n         any such arrangements.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(iii). A footnote in the commentary to the regulations states that\n“[n]othing in these final regulations prohibits an eligible organization from expressing its\nopposition to the use of contraceptives.” Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\nAffordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39870, 39880 n.41 (July 2, 2013) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2510, 2590; 45 C.F.R. § 147, 156). The regulations thus draw a line between impermissible\nefforts to interfere with or influence a third-party administrator’s provision of contraceptive\ncoverage and permissible expressions of opposition to contraceptives.\n\n         The appellants have presented their objections to this regulation at a very high level of\ngenerality and fail to identify what protected speech this regulation chills.13 It is not clear what\nthe appellants want to do or say that they believe this regulation prohibits. Do the appellants feel\nchilled from having a calm discussion with their third-party administrator about Catholic\ndoctrine, discouraging third-party administrators from entering into or maintaining contractual\nrelationships with religiously affiliated organizations, encouraging the insurance issuer to violate\nfederal law and refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, or something else altogether? We do\n\n         13\n            Only the MCC plaintiffs raised this claim in their complaint, where they allege that contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement “impos[es] a gag order that prohibits Plaintiffs from speaking out in any way that might\n‘influence,’ ‘directly or indirectly,’ the decision of a third party administrator to provide or procure contraceptive\nproducts and services to Plaintiffs’ employees.” MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 188) (Page ID #44–45). In their motion for\na preliminary injunction in the district court, they repeated this general argument and asserted that “[p]laintiffs\nbelieve that contraception is immoral, and by expressing that conviction they routinely seek to ‘influence’ or\npersuade their fellow citizens of that view.” MCC R. 15 (Prelim. Inj. Memo at 38) (Page ID #639). In their brief to\nthis court, the appellants make a brief, general argument that they “believe that contraception is contrary to their\nfaith, and speak and act accordingly. The Government has no authority to outlaw such expression.” Appellant Br.\nat 55.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640       Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.           Page 23\n\nnot know. Not all speech is protected by the First Amendment; for example, “an employer is\nfree to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism” but may not\nmake “a ‘threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.” N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co.,\n395 U.S. 575, 618 (1969). Given the failure to “[tell] us what [they] want[] to say but fear[] to\nsay” and the fact that “the government hasn’t clearly embraced an interpretation of the regulation\nthat would give rise to the [First Amendment] concerns,” Univ. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 561,\nthe appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.\n\n       2. Free Exercise Clause\n\n       The Free Exercise Clause is not violated by neutral laws of general applicability, “even if\nthe law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.” Church of the\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah (“Church of the L.B.A.”), 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993).\nA law that is not neutral and of general applicability still does not violate the Free Exercise\nClause if the law is “justified by a compelling governmental interest” and “narrowly tailored to\nadvance that interest.” Id. at 531–32. The appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage\nrequirement is not a neutral law of general applicability because they say it was targeted at\nCatholic entities and has many exemptions. Appellant Br. at 53–54. On the contrary, the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement is a neutral law of general applicability and does not violate\nthe Free Exercise Clause.\n\n       A law is not neutral “if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because\nof their religious motivation.” Church of the L.B.A., 508 U.S. at 533. “A law lacks facial\nneutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernible from the\nlanguage or context.” Id. However, “[f]acial neutrality is not determinative . . . ‘The Court must\nsurvey meticulously the circumstances of governmental categories to eliminate, as it were,\nreligious gerrymanders.’” Id. at 534 (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm’n of New York City, 397 U.S.\n664, 696 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)). The contraceptive-coverage requirement is a neutral\nlaw. Neither the text nor the history of the statute and regulations promulgated pursuant to the\nstatute demonstrate that the requirement was targeted at a particular religious practice. There is\nno evidence that Congress and the executive branch agencies “had as their object the suppression\nof religion.” Id. at 542. The record does not “disclose[] animosity” towards the Catholic\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 24\n\npractice of refusing to support access to contraception, the framework does not “by [its] own\nterms target this religious exercise,” the program was not “gerrymandered with care to proscribe”\nthe Catholic exercise of religion with respect to contraception but not secular opposition to\ncontraception; and the arrangement does not “suppress much more religious conduct than is\nnecessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense.” Id. at 542. The\nappellants argue that the Government was aware of the refusal of Catholic employers to provide\ncontraceptive coverage and enacted the requirement to force Catholic employers to violate their\nreligious beliefs.   Appellant Br. at 54.     This argument is unpersuasive; the fact that the\nGovernment has required a religiously affiliated entity to do something that it does not want to\non the basis of religion does not, ipso facto, mean that the law was targeted at religious practice.\nAccordingly, the framework is neutral.\n\n       A law is not of general applicability if it “in a selective manner impose[s] burdens only\non conduct motivated by religious belief,” Church of the L.B.A., 508 U.S. at 543. The appellants\nargue that the requirement is not generally applicable because grandfathered plans, small\nbusinesses, and religious employers that obtain an exemption need not comply with the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement. This argument misunderstands the meaning of general\napplicability under our Free Exercise jurisprudence.       “General applicability does not mean\nabsolute universality.” See Olsen v. Mukasey, 541 F.3d 827, 832 (8th Cir. 2008). A law need\nnot apply to every person or business in America to be generally applicable. A law is generally\napplicable if it does not make distinctions based on religion. To determine this, we consider\nwhether the “legislature decide[d] that the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy\nof being pursued only against conduct with a religious motivation.” Church of the L.B.A.,\n508 U.S. at 542–43. The requirement at issue here does not pursue the governmental interest in\ncontraceptive coverage only against entities with a religiously motivated objection to providing\nsuch coverage; that interest is pursued uniformly against all businesses that are not grandfathered\nand have more than fifty employees.        This includes entities that have no objection to the\nrequirement, entities that object for non-religious reasons such as general opposition to\ngovernment dictating healthcare requirements, and entities that object to the requirement for\nreligious reasons. See, e.g., Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1134 (9th Cir. 2009)\n(holding a rule was generally applicable because “pharmacists who do not have a religious\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.            Page 25\n\nobjection to Plan B must comply with the rules to the same extent—no more and no less—than\npharmacies and pharmacists who may have a religious objection to Plan B”). In fact, the\navailability of the exemption and the accommodation means that the law imposes a lesser burden\non those who object for religious reasons because they do not have to pay for the coverage.\nAccordingly, the program is generally applicable.\n\n         Because the law requiring contraceptive coverage is neutral and generally applicable, it\ndoes not violate the Free Exercise Clause even if it incidentally burdens the exercise of religion.\nThus, the appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of this\nclaim.\n\n         3. Establishment Clause\n\n         “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” U.S. Const.\namend. I. However, “[the Supreme] Court has long recognized that the government may (and\nsometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the\nEstablishment Clause.” Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 144–\n45 (1987). The appellants argue that allowing some entities with a religious mission to obtain\nthe exemption and others to obtain only the accommodation violates the Establishment Clause\nbecause the distinction “favors some types of religious organizations and denominations over\nothers” and creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion. Appellant Br.\nat 59. Because the law’s distinction does not favor a certain denomination and does not cause\nexcessive entanglement between government and religion, the framework does not violate the\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n         “The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination\ncannot be officially preferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982).\n“[N]o State can ‘pass laws which aid one religion’ or that ‘prefer one religion over another.’” Id.\nat 246 (quoting Everson v. Bd. of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15 (1947)). For a claim such as this based\non the allegedly disparate treatment of religions, “the constitutional value at issue is ‘neutrality.’”\nGillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 450 (1971).            The line that the exemption and\naccommodation framework draws between eligibility for the exemption and for the\naccommodation is based on organizational form and purpose, not religious denomination. Such\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.         Page 26\n\na distinction does not violate the Establishment Clause. “[R]eligious employers, defined as in\nthe cited regulation, have long enjoyed advantages (notably tax advantages) over other entities,\n26 U.S.C. §§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii), without these advantages being thought to violate the\nestablishment clause.” Univ. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 560 (citing Walz, 397 U.S. at 672–73).\nThe appellants’ reliance on the Tenth Circuit’s decision in Colorado Christian University v.\nWeaver, 534 F.3d 1245 (10th Cir. 2008), is misplaced. There, the Tenth Circuit held that a state\nlaw permitting scholarship funding for students attending religious schools only if the school was\nnot “pervasively” sectarian violated the Establishment Clause. Id. at 1258–60. The law did not\nmake distinctions based on organizational form, as here; the Colorado law violated the\nEstablishment Clause because it discriminated based on the nature of religious belief and\npractice at the university.   Accordingly, that case provides no support for the appellants’\nargument. The fact that all of the appellants are affiliated with the Catholic Church and some are\neligible for the exemption while others are eligible for the accommodation demonstrates that the\nframework does not discriminate based on denomination.               Because the exemption and\naccommodation arrangement distinguishes between entities based on organizational form, not\ndenomination, it does not express an unconstitutional state preference on the basis of religion.\n\n       Further, the provisions do not excessively entangle government and religion.            The\nregulations define a “religious employer” as “an organization that is organized and operates as a\nnonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The referenced sections of the Internal\nRevenue Code provide exceptions from certain tax-return filing requirements for “churches, their\nintegrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches” and “the exclusively\nreligious activities of any religious order.”     26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii).    The IRS\nconsiders numerous factors to determine if an entity is eligible for the exceptions in\n§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii). See Am. Guidance Found., Inc. v. United States, 490 F. Supp. 304, 306\n(D.D.C. 1980). The appellants argue that “these factors favor some religious groups over others\n. . . on the basis of intrusive judgments regarding beliefs, practices, and organizational\nstructures.” Appellant Br. at 63–64. However, the government argues that the “qualification for\nthe religious employer exemption does not require the government to make any determination,\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640             Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                     Page 27\n\nwhether as a result of the application of the non-exhaustive, non-binding list or otherwise.”\nGovernment Br. at 54–55. Plaintiffs have not shown how this is not correct.\n\n         Because the exemption and accommodation provisions do not prefer a denomination or\nexcessively entangle government in religious practice, they do not violate the Establishment\nClause. Thus, the appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits\nof this claim.\n\nD. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n         Finally, the MCC appellants14 argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement violates\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the requirement violates the Weldon\nAmendment and thus is “not in accordance with law,” and because the IOM guidelines\nrecommending that contraception be included as preventive care were not subject to notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking requirements. We conclude that the appellants have not demonstrated a\nstrong likelihood of success on the merits of the Weldon Amendment claim, and we decline to\nreach the notice-and-comment claim.\n\n         1. Weldon Amendment\n\n         The MCC appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement violates the\nWeldon Amendment and therefore is “not in accordance with law,” as required by the APA. The\nAPA provides that a “reviewing court shall . . . (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action,\nfindings, and conclusions found to be—(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The Weldon Amendment is a\nrider to an appropriations bill that denies funding to federal agencies or programs “if such\nagency, program, or government subjects any institutional or individual health care entity to\ndiscrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage\nof, or refer for abortions.”15 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div.\n\n         14\n           Although the CDN plaintiffs included an APA claim in their complaint, that claim was not raised in the\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, and so the district court correctly treated the claim as waived for purposes of the\npreliminary injunction. Catholic Diocese of Nashville, 2013 WL 6834375, at *10 n.13.\n         15\n           It is not clear that any of the MCC appellants who properly raised this claim is an “institutional or\nindividual health care entity” within the meaning of the Weldon Amendment. The Weldon Amendment defines\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 28\n\nF, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 Stat. 786, 1111 (2011). The district court held that the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement does not violate the Weldon Amendment because the FDA-approved\nemergency contraceptives are not defined as abortion-inducing products under federal law. The\nappellants argue that this analysis is in error because the court should defer to the plan provider’s\ndefinition of “abortion” and the appellants believe that the “morning-after pill (Plan B) and\nUlipristal (HRP 2000 or [e]lla)” are “abortion-inducing products.” Appellant Br. at 65.\n\n         The appellants are correct that the Weldon Amendment does not define abortion. The\nappellants argue that the absence of a statutory definition means that the court should defer to\ntheir independent interpretation of “abortion.” That is not how statutory interpretation works.\nRather, the federal courts will utilize traditional methods of statutory interpretation to determine\nwhether “abortion” in the Weldon Amendment includes FDA-approved emergency\ncontraceptives.\n\n         The        government           notes        that       the       FDA-approved             labels        for\nPlan B and ella describe these products              as      emergency           contraceptives          and      do\nnot mention abortion. See FDA-approved label for Plan                          B,            available             at\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021045s015lbl.pdf;                        FDA-approved\nlabel for ella http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/022474s002lbl.pdf.\nThe appellants do not identify any statutory or regulatory definition of abortion that includes\n\n“[h]ealth care entity” as “an individual physician or other health care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored\norganization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care facility,\norganization, or plan.” Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(2).\nThe appellants allege that the Michigan Catholic Conference Second Amended and Restated Group Health Benefit\nPlan for Employees (“MCC Benefit Plan”) is a health plan. MCC R. 1 (MCC Compl. at ¶ 16) (Page ID #7).\nHowever, it is not clear that the MCC Benefit Plan is an actual plaintiff in this case. The complaint is captioned\n“MICHIGAN CATHOLIC CONFERENCE in its own name and on behalf of the MICHIGAN CATHOLIC\nCONFERENCE SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED GROUP HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN FOR\nEMPLOYEES . . . .” MCC R. 1 (MCC Compl. at 1) (Page ID #1). Although the complaint describes MCC and\nCatholic Charities as “plaintiff[s],” it does not describe the MCC Benefit Plan as a plaintiff. See id. at ¶¶ 16, 17\n(Page ID #7). However, because we affirm the denial of the preliminary injunction on this claim, we need not\ndecide this issue at this time.\n         We also question the appellants’ assumption that MCC is discriminated against for refusing to provide\ncontraceptive coverage. MCC concedes that it is eligible for the religious-employer exemption. MCC R. 1 (Compl.\nat ¶ 9) (Page ID #4). Consequently, its health insurance plan need not cover contraception or emergency\ncontraception. Thus, it is not clear how MCC is discriminated against for refusing to provide contraceptive\ncoverage. See Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, 2013 WL 6729515, at *46 (holding that the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement is consistent with the Weldon Amendment for entities that are eligible for the\nexemption or the accommodation).\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640          Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.         Page 29\n\nemergency contraceptives. Because the burden is on the appellants to demonstrate a strong\nlikelihood of success on the merits, and the appellants have neither asserted nor argued nor\npresented evidence that the federal government classifies these drugs as abortifacients, they have\nnot shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claim.\n\n          2. Notice and Comment\n\n          The appellants argue that the government violated the APA because it did not subject the\nIOM recommendation that preventive services include contraceptive coverage to notice and\ncomment rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 553(b). Appellant Br. 66–68. This claim was not\nproperly raised in or decided by the district court, so we decline to address it for the first time on\nappeal.\n\n          As discussed supra, the CDN plaintiffs did not raise any APA claims in their motion for a\npreliminary injunction. The MCC plaintiffs’ only reference to a notice-and-comment claim is a\nsingle sentence in the introduction section of their memorandum in support of the motion for a\npreliminary injunction:      “Finally, the Mandate violates the Administrative Procedure Act\n(‘APA’) because Defendants failed to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking, and it\ncontravenes the clear terms of the Weldon Amendment.” MCC R. 15 (Prelim. Inj. Memo. at 3)\n(Page ID #604). In the argument section of the memorandum the MCC plaintiffs discussed the\nWeldon Amendment issue, but did not return to the notice-and-comment issue. See id. at 44–45\n(Page ID #645–46). The district court did not address the notice-and-comment argument in its\ndecision. See Michigan Catholic Conference, 2013 WL 6838707, at *13.\n\n          We generally do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. In re Cannon,\n277 F.3d 838, 848 (6th Cir. 2002). “Factors guiding the determination of whether to consider an\nissue for the first time on appeal include:\n\n          1) whether the issue newly raised on appeal is a question of law, or whether it\n          requires or necessitates a determination of facts; 2) whether the proper resolution\n          of the new issue is clear and beyond doubt; 3) whether failure to take up the issue\n          for the first time on appeal will result in a miscarriage of justice or a denial of\n          substantial justice; and 4) the parties’ right under our judicial system to have the\n          issues in their suit considered by both a district judge and an appellate court.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 30\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to\naddress this claim.\n\nE. Other Factors for Injunctive Relief\n\n       We conclude that the appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on\nthe merits of any of their properly raised claims. The other three factors that we consider in\nevaluating a request for a preliminary injunction are: (2) whether the movant would suffer\nirreparable injury without the injunction; (3) whether issuance of the injunction would cause\nsubstantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuance of the\ninjunction. City of Pontiac Retired Emps. Ass’n, 2014 WL 1758913, at *2. When the alleged\ninjury is to a First Amendment freedom, as here, the strong likelihood of success on the merits\nfactor merges with the irreparable injury factor. “To the extent that [appellant] can establish a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of its First Amendment claim, it also has established the\npossibility of irreparable harm as a result of the deprivation of the claimed free speech rights.”\nConnection Distrib. Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 288 (6th Cir. 1998). Conversely, if appellant\n“does not have a likelihood of success on the merits . . . his argument that he is irreparably\nharmed by the deprivation of his First Amendment right also fails.” McNeilly, 684 F.3d at 615.\nBecause the appellants do not demonstrate a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their\nclaims, they also do not demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable injury without the\ninjunction.\n\n       The district courts did not abuse their discretion by denying preliminary injunctions.\n\n                                      III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district courts’ denial of preliminary\ninjunctions. We lift the stay temporarily issued by this court pending resolution of this appeal.\n\f",

The plaintiffs-appellants in this consolidated\nappeal are non-profit entities affiliated with the Catholic Church who have religious objections to\ncertain preventive care standards under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nSpecifically, the appellants object to the requirement that their employer-based health insurance\nplans cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraception, sterilization methods, and\ncounseling. All of the appellants are eligible for either an exemption from the requirement or an\naccommodation to the requirement, through which the entities will not pay for the contraceptive\nproducts and services and the coverage will be independently administered by an insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator. Nonetheless, in their complaints filed in the District Courts\nfor the Middle District of Tennessee and Western District of Michigan, the appellants alleged\nthat the contraceptive-coverage requirement violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; the\nFree Speech, Free Exercise, and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment; and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.            Both district courts denied the appellants’ motions for a\n\n\n        *\n          The Honorable John T.

Factual Background\n\n         The appellants allege that they are Catholic entities that provide “spiritual, educational,\nsocial, and financial services to members of their communities, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.”\nMCC R. 1 (MCC Compl. at ¶ 1) (Page ID #2); CDN R. 1 (CDN Compl. at ¶ 2) (Page ID #2).1\n\n         All appellants currently provide health plans to their employees. Michigan Catholic\nConference (“MCC”) offers a self-insured group health plan that is “administered by separate\nthird party administrators, 2 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Express Scripts.” MCC R.\n1 (Compl. at ¶ 41) (Page ID #13). Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo is a “Covered Unit[]” whose\nemployees may participate in the plan that MCC offers its employees. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at\n¶¶ 41, 50–51) (Page ID #13, 15). The remaining appellants—the Catholic Diocese of Nashville\n(“CDN”);3 Catholic Charities of Tennessee, Inc. (“Catholic Charities of Tennessee”); Camp\nMarymount, Inc. (“Camp Marymount”); Mary, Queen of Angels, Inc. (“MQA”); St. Mary Villa,\nInc. (“St. Mary Villa”); Aquinas College; and Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia Congregation\n(“St. Cecilia Congregation”)—offer fully-insured group health plans.4 CDN R. 1 (Compl. at\n¶¶ 43, 61, 71, 79, 80, 107, 129) (Page ID #13, 17, 19, 20, 25, 30).\n\n\n\n         1\n        MCC R. refers to documents in Michigan Catholic Conference et al. v. Burwell et al., No. 13-2723, and\nCDN R. refers to documents in Catholic Diocese of Nashville et al. v. Burwell et al., No. 13-6640.\n         2\n           “A self-insured plan is one in which benefits are paid from contributions supplied by the employer without\nthe assistance of outside insurance.” 1A Steven Plitt, et al., Couch on Insurance § 10.1 n.1 (3d ed. 2013). “An\nemployer is said to have a ‘self-insured’ plan if [the employer] bears the financial risk of paying claims.”\nGovernment Br. at 7 n.1. Many companies that offer self-insured plans hire an insurance company or other outside\nentity, referred to as a third-party administrator, “to administer their plans, performing functions such as developing\nnetworks of providers, negotiating payment rates, and processing claims.” Id.\n         3\n          CDN offers its employees a choice including a preferred provider option (“PPO plan”) and a high-\ndeductible option. CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 43) (Page ID #13). The PPO plan meets the definition of a\n“grandfathered plan” under the ACA; thus, at this time, that plan is exempt from the contraceptive-coverage\nrequirement. CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 46) (Page ID #13).\n         4\n          “An insured plan, also known as a fully insured plan, is one in which insurance is purchased from a\nregulated insurance company.” 1A Steven Plitt, et al., Couch on Insurance § 10.1 n.1 (3d ed. 2013).\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640       Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 4\n\nMCC, CDN, and St. Cecilia Congregation allege that they are eligible for the total exemption\nfrom the contraceptive-coverage requirement for “religious employers,” meaning that their\nhealth plans need not provide contraceptive coverage. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 9) (Page ID #4);\nCDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 14) (Page ID #7). The remaining appellants allege that they are eligible\nfor the accommodation for certain religiously affiliated non-profits. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 11)\n(Page ID #5); CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 10) (Page ID #5).\n\n                                    Regulatory Background\n\n       The enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) in 2010\nestablished new minimum standards requiring employer-based group health plans and health\ninsurance issuers to cover certain services without cost-sharing through a deductible or other\npayment by the plan participant or beneficiary. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. The term “group health\nplan” is broadly defined to include both insured group health plans and self-insured group health\nplans: “[t]he term ‘group health plan’ means an employee welfare benefit plan . . . to the extent\nthat the plan provides medical care (as defined in paragraph (2)) and including items and services\npaid for as medical care) to employees or their dependents (as defined under the terms of the\nplan) directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).\nCongressional hearings emphasized the importance of coverage without cost-sharing for\nwomen’s specific healthcare needs because “women have different health needs than men, and\nthese needs often generate additional costs.” 155 Cong. Rec. 29049, 29070 (Dec. 2, 2009)\n(statement of Sen. Feinstein). “Women of childbearing age spent 68 percent more in out-of-\npocket health care costs than men.” Id. Additionally, the legislative debates recognized that\nmedical costs disproportionately discourage women from seeking treatment: “[w]omen are more\nlikely than men to neglect care or treatment because of cost.” 155 Cong. Rec. S11985, S11987\n(daily ed. Nov. 30. 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski). The enacted law thus required coverage\nfor, “with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as provided for\nin comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.”\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4); see also Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating\nto Coverage of Preventive Services under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640             Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                  Page 5\n\n77 Fed. Reg. 8725-01, 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590; 45 C.F.R. pt.\n147).\n\n        For assistance in developing the guidelines for covered “preventive care and screenings,”\nid., the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) asked the Institute of Medicine\n(“IOM”) to bring together a committee to “conduct a review of effective preventive services to\nensure women’s health and well-being.” IOM, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing\nthe Gaps (“Closing the Gaps”) (2011), 1.5 “The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970\nby the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate\nprofessions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public.” Id. at iv.\nThe members of the Committee on Preventive Services for Women (“Committee”) included\n“specialists in disease prevention, women’s health issues, adolescent health issues, and evidence-\nbased guidelines.” Id. at 2. The Committee recommended preventive measures that “met the\nfollowing criteria:\n\n        ●          The condition to be prevented affects a broad population;\n        ●          The condition to be prevented has a large potential impact on health and\n                   well-being; and\n        ●          The quality and strength of the evidence is supportive.\n\nId. at 8. The Committee made eight recommendations6 for preventive services for women,\nincluding coverage for “the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive\nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with\nreproductive capacity.” Id. at 10; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725. This recommendation was\nbased on the Committee’s concern about the high rate of unintended pregnancy in the United\nStates; forty-nine percent of pregnancies in 2001 “were unintended—defined as unwanted or\nmistimed at the time of conception,” a rate much higher than comparable developed countries.\nClosing the Gaps at 102. The rate of unintended pregnancy “is more likely among women who\nare aged 18 to 24 years and unmarried, who have a low income, who are not high school\ngraduates, and who are members of a racial or ethnic minority group.” Id. The Committee\n\n        5\n          The report may be read online for free at:         http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Clinical-Preventive-\nServices-for-Women-Closing-the-Gaps.aspx.\n        6\n            One of the sixteen members of the Committee, Anthony Lo Sasso, dissented from the report.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640          Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                  Page 6\n\nconcluded that contraceptive coverage would greatly decrease the risk of unwanted pregnancies,\nadverse pregnancy outcomes, and other negative health consequences, and significantly reduce\nwomen’s medical costs.          Id. at 102–07.        The regulations promulgated by the agencies\nimplementing the ACA required group health plans and insurance issuers offering group or\nindividual health insurance coverage to provide coverage without cost-sharing for preventive\ncare and screenings provided for in guidelines supported by the HRSA.                        See 26 C.F.R.\n§ 54.9815-2713A (Tax); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A (Labor); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131 (Health and\nHuman Services).7\n\n        The regulations provide for a religious-employer exemption from the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement and an accommodation for certain non-profits that do not qualify for the\nexemption but that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds. The government first\ndeveloped the religious-employer exemption, under which HRSA is authorized to “establish an\nexemption . . . with respect to a group health plan established or maintained by a religious\nemployer (and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan\nestablished or maintained by a religious employer) with respect to any requirement to cover\ncontraceptive services under such guidelines.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). A “religious employer”\nis defined as “an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred\nto in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a); see 26 U.S.C. §§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii) (referring to “churches, their\nintegrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches” and “the exclusively\nreligious activities of any religious order.”).\n\n        Based on objections that the religious-employer exemption as borrowed from the Tax\nCode was drawn too narrowly, the government developed a special accommodation for certain\nnon-profits. The accommodation was intended to “meet two goals—providing contraceptive\ncoverage without cost-sharing to individuals who want it and accommodating non-exempted,\nnon-profit organizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive services.” 77 Fed. Reg.\n\n\n        7\n         The Department of Treasury, Department of Labor, and Department of Health and Human Services\npromulgated identical regulations regarding the framework. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A; 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A; 45 C.F.R. § 147.131. For the sake of simplicity, we cite only the Department of Labor regulations.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640         Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 7\n\nat 8727.

Both sets of plaintiffs alleged that the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; the Free\nExercise, Free Speech, and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.        In November 2013, the plaintiffs moved for preliminary\ninjunctions in their respective district courts. The District Court for the Western District of\nMichigan denied a preliminary injunction on all claims because the plaintiffs had not shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claims.

ANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       As we recently stated in a unanimous en banc decision, there are:\n\n       four factors [the district court] must balance when considering a motion for\n       preliminary injunction: (1) whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success\n       on the merits; (2) whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury without the\n       injunction; (3) whether issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to\n       others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuance of the\n       injunction. When a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the basis of a\n       potential constitutional violation, the likelihood of success on the merits often will\n       be the determinative factor. Whether the movant is likely to succeed on the\n       merits is a question of law we review de novo. We review for abuse of discretion,\n       however, the district court’s ultimate determination as to whether the four\n       preliminary injunction factors weigh in favor of granting or denying preliminary\n       injunctive relief. This standard is deferential, but the court may reverse the\n       district court if it improperly applied the governing law, used an erroneous legal\n       standard, or relied upon clearly erroneous findings of fact.\n\nCity of Pontiac Retired Emps.

Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n\n       The appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement violates the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) because it imposes a substantial burden on their exercise of\nreligion by forcing them to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to insurance coverage for\ncontraception, and the contraceptive-coverage requirement is not the least restrictive means to\nfurther a compelling government interest. Both district courts concluded that the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement does not impose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion because\nthe plaintiffs were eligible for either the exemption or the accommodation from the requirement.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640           Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                   Page 9\n\n        To analyze properly the appellants’ claim under RFRA, we begin with the genesis of the\nlaw. In Sherbert v.

To make an individual’s obligation to obey\n        such a law contingent upon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs,\n        except where the State’s interest is compelling—permitting him, by virtue of his\n        beliefs, to become a law unto himself—contradicts both constitutional tradition\n        and common sense.\n\nId. at 884–85 (quotation marks and internal citations omitted).

Under RFRA, the government may not “substantially burden a person’s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless the\ngovernment demonstrates that application of the burden “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling\ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\ngovernmental interest.” 8 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1(a), (b).\n\n\n        8\n          As a preliminary matter, we note two questions that have not been raised by the parties in this case and\nthat, because we conclude that the contraceptive-coverage requirement does not violate RFRA, we need not address.\nFirst, whether the appellants, all of whom are non-profit corporations, are “persons” capable of the “exercise of\nreligion” within the meaning of RFRA. Second, whether RFRA applies to a later-enacted statute. RFRA contains\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 10\n\nWe follow a two-step process for analyzing RFRA claims:\n\n         First, the plaintiff must make out a prima facie case by establishing Article III\n         standing and showing that the law in question would (1) substantially burden (2) a\n         sincere (3) religious exercise. If the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, it falls\n         to the government to demonstrate[ ] that application of the burden to the person\n         (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\n         restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. The\n         government carries the burdens of both production and persuasion when it seeks\n         to justify a substantial burden on a sincere religious practice.\n\nAutocam Corp. v.

But a government action does not constitute a substantial\nburden on the exercise of religion even if “the challenged Government action would interfere\nsignificantly with private persons’ ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own\nreligious beliefs” if the governmental action does not coerce the individuals to violate their\nreligious beliefs or deny them the “rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.”\nLyng v.

Essentially, RFRA purports to bind all later Congresses unless they specifically reject the\napplication of RFRA by the means specified by the earlier Congress that enacted RFRA.

Thus, Congress\nmay reject the application of RFRA to a later-enacted statute without explicitly stating that RFRA does not apply.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640           Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.        Page 11\n\n        The exercise of religion that appellants argue is burdened by the contraceptive-coverage\nrequirement is their “refus[al] to take certain actions in furtherance of a regulatory scheme to\nprovide their employees with coverage for abortion-inducing products, contraceptives,\nsterilization, and related education and counseling.” Appellant Br. at 26–27. The government\ndoes not dispute that the appellants’ desire not to participate in the provision of contraception is a\nsincere religious belief.\n\n        The government does argue, however, that the contraceptive-coverage requirement does\nnot impose a substantial burden on the appellants’ exercise of religion. Because the appellants\nall concede that they are eligible for either the exemption or the accommodation, they need not\nactually participate in the contraceptive-coverage requirement. Government Br. at 18–19. The\nappellants respond that the exemption and accommodation do not alleviate the burden of the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement because the process to obtain the exemption or\naccommodation forces the appellants “to play an integral role in the delivery of objectionable\nproducts and services to their employees.” Appellant Br. at 27–29.\n\n        First, we must address the appellants’ argument that the court should defer to their\nconclusion that the exemption and accommodation arrangement forces them to provide, pay for,\nand/or facilitate access to contraceptive coverage. See Appellant Br. at 18–20 (describing the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the contraceptive-coverage requirement imposes a burden on third\nparties, not the appellants, as a “foray into the theology behind Catholic precepts on\ncontraception [that] was manifestly improper”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Appellant Br.\nat 36 (“Whether the accommodation relieves Appellants of moral culpability for their actions\n(i.e., allows them to opt out) or makes them complicit in a grave moral wrong is a question of\nreligious conscience for [Appellants] to decide.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).            Put\nanother way, the appellants appear to ask the court to defer not only to their belief that requesting\nthe exemption or the accommodation makes them complicit in sin, but also to defer to their\nunderstanding of how the regulatory measure actually works.\n\n        But as was recently explained, “there is nothing about RFRA or First Amendment\njurisprudence that requires the Court to accept plaintiffs’ characterization of the regulatory\nscheme on its face.” Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. Sebelius, --F. Supp. 2d--, No.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.

Although we are in no position to determine the moral\nor theological consequences of appellants requesting the exemption or accommodation, we must\ndetermine the legal consequences. Whether a government obligation substantially burdens the\nexercise of religion is a question of law, not a “question[] of fact, proven by the credibility of the\nclaimant.” Mahoney v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219205\"><a href=\"/opinion/219205/mahoney-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). We “accept[ ] as true the\nfactual allegations that [appellants’] beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature—but not the\nlegal conclusion, cast as a factual allegation, that [their] religious exercise is substantially\nburdened.” Kaemmerling v.

Thus, although we\nacknowledge that the appellants believe that the regulatory framework makes them complicit in\nthe provision of contraception, we will independently determine what the regulatory provisions\nrequire and whether they impose a substantial burden on appellants’ exercise of religion.\n\n       1. Appellants Eligible for the Exemption\n\n       MCC, CDN, and St. Cecilia Congregation allege that they are eligible for the religious-\nemployer exemption from the contraceptive-coverage requirement. MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 9)\n(Page ID #4); CDN R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 14) (Page ID #7). The government agrees that these three\nappellants are “exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement under 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(a).” Government Br. at 9–10, 18; see also Government Br. at 13. The appellants do\nnot object to any specific act that they must engage in to obtain the exemption. Indeed, the\ngovernment states that these “[p]laintiffs are . . . already exempt from the requirement to provide\ncontraceptive coverage.” Government Br. at 13. Because both parties agree that MCC, CDN,\nand St. Cecilia Congregation are eligible for the exemption and because the appellants do not\nidentify any particular action that they must take to obtain the exemption that burdens their\nexercise of religion, appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the\nmerits of this claim.\n\n       2. Appellants Eligible for the Accommodation\n\n       The contraceptive-coverage framework does not impose a burden on the exercise of\nreligion by those remaining appellants who are eligible for the accommodation. If an entity has\nan insured group health insurance plan, all that the entity must do to obtain the accommodation is\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 13\n\n“furnish[] a copy of the self-certification . . . to each issuer that would otherwise provide such\ncoverage in connection with the group health plan.”9 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(1). If an\nentity has a self-insured plan, such as Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo, all that the entity must do\nto obtain the accommodation is “[c]ontract with one or more third party administrators”10 and\n“provide[] each third party administrator that will process claims for any contraceptive services11\n. . . with a copy of the self-certification.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(i), (ii). That is the\nentirety of the conduct that the objecting organization must engage in to obtain the\naccommodation.\n\n         The appellants are not required to “provide” contraceptive coverage.                        They are not\nrequired physically to distribute contraception to their employees upon request, and the eligible\norganization’s health plan does not host the coverage. Upon receipt of the self-certification\nform, the insurance issuer “must—(A) Expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group\nhealth insurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan.”                            29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(i)(A). In the self-insured context, the self-certification form declares to\nthe third-party administrator that “[t]he eligible organization will not act as the plan\nadministrator or claims administrator with respect to claims for contraceptive services.”\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(A).                Instead, the third-party administrator “shall be\nresponsible for . . . compliance with” the preventive care and screenings provided for in the\nHRSA guidelines.          29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b), (b)(1) (referencing obligations in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300gg-13 and 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)). Thus, although the insurance issuer or\nthird-party administrator will provide contraceptive coverage, the appellants will not.\n\n\n\n\n         9\n          Nothing in the record indicates that any of the insurance issuers with which the appellants contract has\nrefused to provide contraceptive coverage upon receipt of a self-certification form.\n         10\n            Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo, the only appellant alleging that it is eligible for the accommodation and\nhas a self-insured plan, already contracts with a third-party administrator. This appellant participates in the MCC\nPlan, “which consists of self-funded medical and prescription benefits administered by separate third party\nadministrators, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Express Scripts, respectively.” MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶¶ 41,\n50) (Page ID #13, 15).\n         11\n            Nothing in the record indicates that Catholic Charities of Kalamazoo’s third-party administrator has\nrefused to provide contraceptive coverage upon receipt of a self-certification form.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 14\n\n       The appellants are not required to “pay for” contraceptive coverage. When an insurance\nissuer receives the self-certification form, it “must . . . Provide separate payments for any\ncontraceptive services.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(i)(B). The eligible organization’s\nmoney will not fund the contraceptive coverage: “[t]he issuer must segregate premium revenue\ncollected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for\ncontraceptive services.”      29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(ii).          When a third-party\nadministrator receives the self-certification form, it must “provide or arrange payments for\ncontraceptive services” either by providing the payments itself or arranging for an issuer or\nanother entity to provide the payments. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2)(i), (ii). In either\nsituation, whoever is providing the payments may not “impose[] a premium, fee, or other charge,\nor any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan,\nor plan participants or beneficiaries.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2)(i), (ii); (c)(2)(ii). The\naccommodated entity does not even need to be the one to tell the employees about the\ncontraceptive coverage. The regulations require the insurance issuer or third-party administrator\nto provide written notice to plan participants and beneficiaries “specify[ing] that the eligible\norganization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third party\nadministrator or issuer, as applicable, provides separate payments for contraceptive services.”\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d). Thus, although the insurance issuer or third-party administrator\nwill pay for contraceptive coverage, the appellants will not.\n\n       Moreover, the appellants are not required to “facilitate access to” contraceptive coverage.\nThe crux of the appellants’ “facilitation” argument is that providing the self-certification form to\nthe insurance issuer or third-party administrator “triggers” the provision of the contraceptive\ncoverage to their employees. Appellant Br. at 9, 27–31. This argument rests on two assumptions\nthat are, perhaps, two sides of the same coin: first, that the insurance issuer and third-party\nadministrator could not provide the coverage until they receive a self-certification form and\nsecond, that the insurance issuer and third-party administrator then provide the coverage because\nthey received the self-certification form.\n\n       Submitting the self-certification form to the insurance issuer or third-party administrator\ndoes not “trigger” contraceptive coverage; it is federal law that requires the insurance issuer or\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 15\n\nthe third-party administrator to provide this coverage. The ACA requires “[a] group health\nplan12 and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage” to\n“provide coverage for . . . with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings\n. . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 300gg-13(a), (a)(4). Thus, under the ACA, the appellants’ health\nplans and insurance issuers must provide contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing, whether\nor not the appellants decide to self-certify. “Federal law, not the religious organization’s signing\nand mailing the form, requires health-care insurers, along with third-party administrators of self-\ninsured health plans, to cover contraceptive services.” Univ. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554.\n“Because Congress has imposed an independent obligation on insurers to provide contraceptive\ncoverage to Appellants’ employees, those employees will receive contraceptive coverage from\ntheir insurers even if Appellants self-certify—but not because Appellants self-certify.” Roman\nCatholic Archbishop of Washington v. Sebelius, No. 13-5371; Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of\nHealth and Human Servs., No. 13-5368 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 31, 2013) (Tatel, J., dissenting from\ninjunction pending appeal). The obligation to cover contraception will not be triggered by the\nact of self-certification—it already was triggered by the enactment of the ACA.\n\n         The appellants allege that providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to\ncontraceptive coverage burdens their exercise of religion. As discussed supra, the exemption\nand accommodation framework does not require them to do any of these things. The framework\ndoes not permit them to prevent their insurance issuer or third-party administrator from\nproviding contraceptive coverage to their employees pursuant to independent obligations under\nfederal law. However, the inability to “restrain the behavior of a third party that conflicts with\nthe [appellants’] religious beliefs,” Michigan Catholic Conference, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6838707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7,\ndoes not impose a burden on the appellants’ exercise of religion. “[W]hile a religious institution\nhas broad immunity from being required to engage in acts that violate the tenets of its faith, it has\n\n\n\n         12\n           Group health plan is broadly defined and includes both insured group health plans and self-insured group\nhealth plans: “[t]he term ‘group health plan’ means an employee welfare benefit plan . . . to the extent that the plan\nprovides medical care (as defined in paragraph (2)) and including items and services paid for as medical care) to\nemployees or their dependents (as defined under the terms of the plan) directly or through insurance, reimbursement,\nor otherwise.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-91(a)(1).\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 16\n\nno right to prevent other institutions, whether the government or a health insurance company,\nfrom engaging in acts that merely offend the institution.” Univ. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 552.\n\n       The government’s imposition of an independent obligation on a third party does not\nimpose a substantial burden on the appellants’ exercise of religion. In Bowen v. Roy, a pre-Smith\nFree Exercise case, the Supreme Court rejected a Free Exercise claim against the government’s\nuse of a Native American child’s Social Security number. The father of the child “believe[d] the\nuse of the number may harm his daughter’s spirit.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111688\"><a href=\"/opinion/111688/bowen-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699 (1986). The Court\nconcluded that the Free Exercise Clause did not allow an individual to force the Government to\nconform its conduct to the individual’s religious beliefs. “Never to our knowledge has the Court\ninterpreted the First Amendment to require the Government itself to behave in ways that the\nindividual believes will further his or her spiritual development or that of his or her family.” Id.\nThe family “may not demand that the Government join in their chosen religious practices . . . .\nAs a result, Roy may no more prevail on his religious objection to the Government’s use of a\nSocial Security number for his daughter than he could on a sincere religious objection to the size\nor color of the Government’s filing cabinets.” Id. at 700. Just as the government’s use of the\nchild’s Social Security number “does not itself in any degree impair [the family’s] ‘freedom to\nbelieve, express, and exercise[e]’ [their] religion,” id., the Government’s instruction to insurance\nissuers and third-party administrators to provide contraceptive coverage does not force the\nappellants to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to the coverage.\n\n       Similarly, in Kaemmerling v. Lappin the D.C. Circuit rejected a RFRA claim because the\nchallenged government action did not require anything of the challenger. A prisoner expressed\nreligious objections to the government collecting and analyzing his DNA profile pursuant to the\nDNA Act. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187263\"><a href=\"/opinion/187263/kaemmerling-v-lappin/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678–79 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The court held that the prisoner “cannot\nidentify any ‘exercise’ which is the subject of the burden to which he objects” because the\ngovernmental process of extracting DNA “involves no action or forbearance on [the prisoner’s]\npart, nor does it otherwise interfere with any religious act in which he engages.” Id. at 679.\nHere, the only thing that the exemption and accommodation framework requires of the appellants\nis conduct in which they already engage. They will continue to sponsor health plans, contract\nwith insurance issuers or third-party administrators, and declare their opposition to providing\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 17\n\ncontraceptive coverage to their insurance issuer and third-party administrator.           Michigan\nCatholic Conference, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6838707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7. The only difference in conduct is on the part of\nthe insurance issuer or third-party administrator; appellants “are not required to ‘modify [their]\nbehavior.’ Rather, it is the TPA [or insurance issuer] that is required to modify its behavior and\ntake action by providing contraceptive services—without the assistance of” the appellant. Id.\nEmployees and beneficiaries will receive contraceptive coverage, but that coverage will be\n“despite plaintiffs’ religious objections, not because of them.” Government Br. at 26. Again, the\ninsurance issuers and third-party administrators are not parties to this suit and have not expressed\nany opposition to complying with the contraceptive-coverage requirement. The fact that the\nregulations require the insurance issuers and third-party administrators to modify their behavior\ndoes not demonstrate a substantial burden on the appellants.\n\n        In addition to the objection to the self-certification form, the appellants raise various\nprocedural objections to the accommodation framework, none of which is meritorious. The\nappellants object to having to offer enrollment paperwork to allow employees to enroll in the\nplan overseen by the third party and to sending health-plan enrollment paperwork to the third\nparty. Appellant Br. at 29. The regulations do not require either of these acts; the regulations\nspecifically provide that the third-party administrator or insurance issuer (not the accommodated\neligible organization) notifies plan participants and beneficiaries of the availability of payments\nfor contraceptive services. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 2590.715-2713A(d). The appellants object to\nhaving to “[i]dentify for a third party which of their employees will participate in the plan.”\nAppellant Br. at 29. Again, this is not required by the regulations. Moreover, because these\nappellants already contract with insurance issuers and third-party administrators, the insurance\nissuers and third-party administrators presumably already have lists of plan participants and\nbeneficiaries. Finally, the appellants object to having to “[r]efrain from canceling their insurance\narrangement with a third party authorized to provide the objectionable products and services.”\nAppellant Br. at 29. Once again, the regulations do not prohibit the appellants from canceling an\ninsurance arrangement, and the appellants have not expressed any actual intent to do so.\nBecause these objections do not go to actual requirements of the contraceptive-coverage\nframework, they clearly do not demonstrate a substantial burden on appellants’ exercise of\nreligion.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 18\n\n       The appellants argue that the exemption and accommodation mechanism pressures them\nto modify their behavior and violate their religious beliefs because previously they informed\ntheir insurance issuer or third-party administrator of their opposition to contraception and those\nentities did not cover contraception, but now they will inform their insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator of their opposition and those entities will cover contraception. But that is an\nobjection to the later independent action of a third party, not to an obligation imposed on the\nappellants by the government. It is not the act of self-certification that causes the insurance\nissuer and the third-party administrator to cover contraception, it is the law of the United States\nthat does that. Self-certification allows the eligible organization to tell the insurance issuer and\nthird-party administrator “‘we’re excused from the new federal obligation relating to\ncontraception,’ and in turn, the government tells those insurance companies, ‘but you’re not.’”\nUniv. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 557. Perhaps the appellants would like to retain the authority\nto prevent their insurance issuer or third-party administrator from providing contraceptive\ncoverage to appellants’ employees, but “RFRA is not a mechanism to advance a generalized\nobjection to a governmental policy choice, even if it is one sincerely based upon religion.”\nRoman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6729515</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.\n\n       Because these appellants may obtain the accommodation from the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement without providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to contraception,\nthe contraceptive-coverage requirement does not impose a substantial burden on these\nappellants’ exercise of religion. Therefore, these appellants have not demonstrated a strong\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their RFRA claim.\n\nC. First Amendment\n       1.

Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 19\n\nviolates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment by forcing them to provide, pay for,\nand/or facilitate access to contraception counseling; forcing them to speak against their beliefs by\nfilling out the self-certification form; and imposing a “gag order” by prohibiting them from\ninterfering with or seeking to influence a third-party administrator’s decision to cover\ncontraception. We conclude that the contraceptive coverage requirement does not violate the\nFree Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and will address each of the subclaims in turn.\n\n               a. Contraceptive counseling\n\n       First, the appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement unconstitutionally\ncompels speech by forcing them to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to counseling about\ncontraception, and that this obligation violates their religious opposition “to providing any\nsupport for ‘counseling’ that encourages, promotes, or facilitates such practices.” Appellant Br.\nat 57–58. The guidelines recommended coverage without cost-sharing for “the full range of\nFood and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and\npatient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.” Closing the Gaps at\n10; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725. Presumably, this counseling would include discussion of the\nrange of contraceptive options, how the various products work, and what may be a good fit for\nthe counseled individual’s health profile and lifestyle.\n\n       The regulations certainly do not require the accommodated entity to “provide” this\ncounseling. The accommodated entity need not discuss or acknowledge the existence of the\ncounseling coverage; the regulations require the insurance issuer or third-party administrator to\ninform plan participants and beneficiaries that separate payments are available for counseling\nand other contraceptive services. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 2590.715-2713A(d). The regulations make\nno attempt to stop the appellants’ practice of “counsel[ing] men and women against” using\ncontraception. Appellant Br. at 57, 58. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional\nRights, Inc. (“FAIR”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-rights-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (2006) (upholding a statute against a free-exercise\nchallenge; the statute required law schools to give military recruiters equal access to other\nrecruiters as a condition on receipt of certain federal funds, but “[n]othing about recruiting\nsuggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon\nAmendment restricts what the law schools may say about the military’s policies.”). Thus, in no\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 20\n\nway do the regulations compel the appellants’ speech by forcing them to provide contraceptive\ncounseling.\n\n       The regulations also do not compel the appellants’ speech by forcing them to pay for\ncontraceptive counseling. As discussed supra, the regulations specifically prohibit an insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator from passing on the cost of complying with the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement, which includes the cost of contraceptive counseling. See 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(2), (c)(2).\n\n       Finally, the requirements do not force the appellants to facilitate access to contraceptive\ncounseling. It is not clear what speech, exactly, the appellants believe is compelled by the\nfacilitation of such coverage; in any event, as discussed supra, it is federal law, not the\nappellants’ actions, that requires their insurance issuer or third-party administrator to provide\ninsurance coverage for contraceptive counseling.        The contraceptive coverage is provided\nthrough a government regulation of the insurance issuer and third-party administrator, not\nthrough the appellants’ health insurance plan. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(i)(A)\n(upon receipt of the self-certification form, the insurance issuer “must—(A) Expressly exclude\ncontraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with\nthe group health plan”); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(A) (the self-certification form\ndeclares to the third-party administrator that “[t]he eligible organization will not act as the plan\nadministrator or claims administrator with respect to claims for contraceptive services”). Thus,\nthe framework does not require appellants to “host or accommodate another speaker’s message”\nthrough their insurance plan. FAIR, 547 U.S. at 63; cf. Hurley v. Irish-Am.

Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.          Page 21\n\n       The contraceptive counseling provision does not violate the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment. Thus, appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the\nmerits of this claim.\n\n               b. Self-certification Form\n\n       Second, the appellants argue that the requirement that they complete the self-certification\nform in order to obtain the accommodation “compels Appellants to engage in speech that triggers\nprovision of the objectionable products and services, and [ ] deprives Appellants of the freedom\nto speak on the issue of abortion and contraception on their own terms, at a time and place of\ntheir own choosing, outside of the confines of the Government’s regulatory scheme.” Appellant\nBr. at 58. As discussed supra, the self-certification form does not trigger the provision of\ncontraceptive coverage, but instead it triggers the entities’ disassociation from what they deem to\nbe the objectionable coverage. Thus, this framework is nothing like the unconstitutional state\ncampaign finance law in Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, where\nthe state provided matching funds for publicly financed candidates when a privately financed\ncandidate or independent expenditure group spent over a certain amount on the election, thus\nmaking the privately financed candidate’s political expenditures a trigger of funding to his or her\nadversary. --U.S.--, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219735\"><a href=\"/opinion/219735/arizona-free-enterprise-clubs-freedom-club-pac-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2818 (2011). The self-certification form does not have a\nsimilar triggering function. Additionally, the self-certification form does not deprive appellants\nof the freedom to speak out about abortion and contraception on their own terms. The form\nrequires the appellants to assert their opposition to contraception in order to opt out of a\ngenerally applicable government program. Successful compelled-speech cases are those when\n“an individual is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees with, imposed by the\ngovernment.” Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142895\"><a href=\"/opinion/142895/johanns-v-livestock-marketing-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557 (2005). Even assuming that\nthe government is compelling this speech, it is not speech that the appellants disagree with and\nso cannot be the basis of a First Amendment claim. Thus, the self-certification requirement does\nnot compel speech in violation of the First Amendment, and so the appellants have not\ndemonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 22\n\n                  c. “Gag Order”\n\n         Finally, the appellants argue that the accommodation framework imposes an\nunconstitutional “gag order” by prohibiting eligible organizations with self-insured group plans\nfrom interfering with, or seeking to influence, a third-party administrator’s decision to provide\ncontraceptive coverage. Specifically, the regulation provides:\n\n         The eligible organization must not, directly or indirectly, seek to interfere with a\n         third party administrator’s arrangements to provide or arrange separate payments\n         for contraceptive services for participants or beneficiaries, and must not, directly\n         or indirectly, seek to influence the third party administrator’s decision to make\n         any such arrangements.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(iii). A footnote in the commentary to the regulations states that\n“[n]othing in these final regulations prohibits an eligible organization from expressing its\nopposition to the use of contraceptives.” Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\nAffordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39870, 39880 n.41 (July 2, 2013) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2510, 2590; 45 C.F.R. § 147, 156). The regulations thus draw a line between impermissible\nefforts to interfere with or influence a third-party administrator’s provision of contraceptive\ncoverage and permissible expressions of opposition to contraceptives.\n\n         The appellants have presented their objections to this regulation at a very high level of\ngenerality and fail to identify what protected speech this regulation chills.13 It is not clear what\nthe appellants want to do or say that they believe this regulation prohibits. Do the appellants feel\nchilled from having a calm discussion with their third-party administrator about Catholic\ndoctrine, discouraging third-party administrators from entering into or maintaining contractual\nrelationships with religiously affiliated organizations, encouraging the insurance issuer to violate\nfederal law and refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, or something else altogether? We do\n\n         13\n            Only the MCC plaintiffs raised this claim in their complaint, where they allege that contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement “impos[es] a gag order that prohibits Plaintiffs from speaking out in any way that might\n‘influence,’ ‘directly or indirectly,’ the decision of a third party administrator to provide or procure contraceptive\nproducts and services to Plaintiffs’ employees.” MCC R. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 188) (Page ID #44–45). In their motion for\na preliminary injunction in the district court, they repeated this general argument and asserted that “[p]laintiffs\nbelieve that contraception is immoral, and by expressing that conviction they routinely seek to ‘influence’ or\npersuade their fellow citizens of that view.” MCC R. 15 (Prelim. Inj. Memo at 38) (Page ID #639). In their brief to\nthis court, the appellants make a brief, general argument that they “believe that contraception is contrary to their\nfaith, and speak and act accordingly. The Government has no authority to outlaw such expression.” Appellant Br.\nat 55.\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640       Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.           Page 23\n\nnot know.

The appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage\nrequirement is not a neutral law of general applicability because they say it was targeted at\nCatholic entities and has many exemptions. Appellant Br. at 53–54. On the contrary, the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement is a neutral law of general applicability and does not violate\nthe Free Exercise Clause.\n\n       A law is not neutral “if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because\nof their religious motivation.” Church of the L.B.A., 508 U.S. at 533. “A law lacks facial\nneutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernible from the\nlanguage or context.” Id.

This argument is unpersuasive; the fact that the\nGovernment has required a religiously affiliated entity to do something that it does not want to\non the basis of religion does not, ipso facto, mean that the law was targeted at religious practice.\nAccordingly, the framework is neutral.\n\n       A law is not of general applicability if it “in a selective manner impose[s] burdens only\non conduct motivated by religious belief,” Church of the L.B.A., 508 U.S. at 543. The appellants\nargue that the requirement is not generally applicable because grandfathered plans, small\nbusinesses, and religious employers that obtain an exemption need not comply with the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement. This argument misunderstands the meaning of general\napplicability under our Free Exercise jurisprudence.       “General applicability does not mean\nabsolute universality.” See Olsen v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1441390\"><a href=\"/opinion/1441390/olsen-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (8th Cir. 2008). A law need\nnot apply to every person or business in America to be generally applicable. A law is generally\napplicable if it does not make distinctions based on religion. To determine this, we consider\nwhether the “legislature decide[d] that the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy\nof being pursued only against conduct with a religious motivation.” Church of the L.B.A.,\n508 U.S. at 542–43. The requirement at issue here does not pursue the governmental interest in\ncontraceptive coverage only against entities with a religiously motivated objection to providing\nsuch coverage; that interest is pursued uniformly against all businesses that are not grandfathered\nand have more than fifty employees.        This includes entities that have no objection to the\nrequirement, entities that object for non-religious reasons such as general opposition to\ngovernment dictating healthcare requirements, and entities that object to the requirement for\nreligious reasons. See, e.g., Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382726\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382726/stormans-inc-v-selecky/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1134 (9th Cir. 2009)\n(holding a rule was generally applicable because “pharmacists who do not have a religious\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich.

Page 25\n\nobjection to Plan B must comply with the rules to the same extent—no more and no less—than\npharmacies and pharmacists who may have a religious objection to Plan B”). In fact, the\navailability of the exemption and the accommodation means that the law imposes a lesser burden\non those who object for religious reasons because they do not have to pay for the coverage.\nAccordingly, the program is generally applicable.\n\n         Because the law requiring contraceptive coverage is neutral and generally applicable, it\ndoes not violate the Free Exercise Clause even if it incidentally burdens the exercise of religion.\nThus, the appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of this\nclaim.\n\n         3. Establishment Clause\n\n         “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” U.S. Const.\namend. I. However, “[the Supreme] Court has long recognized that the government may (and\nsometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the\nEstablishment Clause.” Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm’n of Fla., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111826\"><a href=\"/opinion/111826/hobbie-v-unemployment-appeals-commn-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 144–\n45 (1987). The appellants argue that allowing some entities with a religious mission to obtain\nthe exemption and others to obtain only the accommodation violates the Establishment Clause\nbecause the distinction “favors some types of religious organizations and denominations over\nothers” and creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion. Appellant Br.\nat 59. Because the law’s distinction does not favor a certain denomination and does not cause\nexcessive entanglement between government and religion, the framework does not violate the\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n         “The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination\ncannot be officially preferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110697\"><a href=\"/opinion/110697/larson-v-valente/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (1982).\n“[N]o State can ‘pass laws which aid one religion’ or that ‘prefer one religion over another.’” Id.\nat 246 (quoting Everson v.

The line that the exemption and\naccommodation framework draws between eligibility for the exemption and for the\naccommodation is based on organizational form and purpose, not religious denomination. Such\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640        Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.         Page 26\n\na distinction does not violate the Establishment Clause. “[R]eligious employers, defined as in\nthe cited regulation, have long enjoyed advantages (notably tax advantages) over other entities,\n26 U.S.C. §§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii), without these advantages being thought to violate the\nestablishment clause.” Univ. of Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 560 (citing Walz, 397 U.S. at 672–73).\nThe appellants’ reliance on the Tenth Circuit’s decision in Colorado Christian University v.\nWeaver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171011\"><a href=\"/opinion/171011/colorado-christian-university-v-weaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2008), is misplaced. There, the Tenth Circuit held that a state\nlaw permitting scholarship funding for students attending religious schools only if the school was\nnot “pervasively” sectarian violated the Establishment Clause. Id. at 1258–60. The law did not\nmake distinctions based on organizational form, as here; the Colorado law violated the\nEstablishment Clause because it discriminated based on the nature of religious belief and\npractice at the university.   Accordingly, that case provides no support for the appellants’\nargument. The fact that all of the appellants are affiliated with the Catholic Church and some are\neligible for the exemption while others are eligible for the accommodation demonstrates that the\nframework does not discriminate based on denomination.               Because the exemption and\naccommodation arrangement distinguishes between entities based on organizational form, not\ndenomination, it does not express an unconstitutional state preference on the basis of religion.\n\n       Further, the provisions do not excessively entangle government and religion.            The\nregulations define a “religious employer” as “an organization that is organized and operates as a\nnonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The referenced sections of the Internal\nRevenue Code provide exceptions from certain tax-return filing requirements for “churches, their\nintegrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches” and “the exclusively\nreligious activities of any religious order.”     26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii).    The IRS\nconsiders numerous factors to determine if an entity is eligible for the exceptions in\n§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii). See Am. Guidance Found., Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1905553\"><a href=\"/opinion/1905553/american-guidance-foundation-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306\n(D.D.C. 1980). The appellants argue that “these factors favor some religious groups over others\n. . . on the basis of intrusive judgments regarding beliefs, practices, and organizational\nstructures.” Appellant Br. at 63–64. However, the government argues that the “qualification for\nthe religious employer exemption does not require the government to make any determination,\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640             Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                     Page 27\n\nwhether as a result of the application of the non-exhaustive, non-binding list or otherwise.”\nGovernment Br. at 54–55. Plaintiffs have not shown how this is not correct.\n\n         Because the exemption and accommodation provisions do not prefer a denomination or\nexcessively entangle government in religious practice, they do not violate the Establishment\nClause. Thus, the appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits\nof this claim.\n\nD. Administrative Procedure Act\n\n         Finally, the MCC appellants14 argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement violates\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the requirement violates the Weldon\nAmendment and thus is “not in accordance with law,” and because the IOM guidelines\nrecommending that contraception be included as preventive care were not subject to notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking requirements. We conclude that the appellants have not demonstrated a\nstrong likelihood of success on the merits of the Weldon Amendment claim, and we decline to\nreach the notice-and-comment claim.\n\n         1. Weldon Amendment\n\n         The MCC appellants argue that the contraceptive-coverage requirement violates the\nWeldon Amendment and therefore is “not in accordance with law,” as required by the APA. The\nAPA provides that a “reviewing court shall . . . (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action,\nfindings, and conclusions found to be—(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The Weldon Amendment is a\nrider to an appropriations bill that denies funding to federal agencies or programs “if such\nagency, program, or government subjects any institutional or individual health care entity to\ndiscrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage\nof, or refer for abortions.”15 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div.\n\n         14\n           Although the CDN plaintiffs included an APA claim in their complaint, that claim was not raised in the\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, and so the district court correctly treated the claim as waived for purposes of the\npreliminary injunction. Catholic Diocese of Nashville, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6834375</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10 n.13.\n         15\n           It is not clear that any of the MCC appellants who properly raised this claim is an “institutional or\nindividual health care entity” within the meaning of the Weldon Amendment. The Weldon Amendment defines\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640            Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.                    Page 28\n\nF, tit. V, § 507(d)(1), 125 Stat. 786, 1111 (2011). The district court held that the contraceptive-\ncoverage requirement does not violate the Weldon Amendment because the FDA-approved\nemergency contraceptives are not defined as abortion-inducing products under federal law. The\nappellants argue that this analysis is in error because the court should defer to the plan provider’s\ndefinition of “abortion” and the appellants believe that the “morning-after pill (Plan B) and\nUlipristal (HRP 2000 or [e]lla)” are “abortion-inducing products.” Appellant Br. at 65.\n\n         The appellants are correct that the Weldon Amendment does not define abortion. The\nappellants argue that the absence of a statutory definition means that the court should defer to\ntheir independent interpretation of “abortion.” That is not how statutory interpretation works.\nRather, the federal courts will utilize traditional methods of statutory interpretation to determine\nwhether “abortion” in the Weldon Amendment includes FDA-approved emergency\ncontraceptives.\n\n         The        government           notes        that       the       FDA-approved             labels        for\nPlan B and ella describe these products              as      emergency           contraceptives          and      do\nnot mention abortion. See FDA-approved label for Plan                          B,            available             at\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021045s015lbl.pdf;                        FDA-approved\nlabel for ella http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/022474s002lbl.pdf.\nThe appellants do not identify any statutory or regulatory definition of abortion that includes\n\n“[h]ealth care entity” as “an individual physician or other health care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored\norganization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care facility,\norganization, or plan.” Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, div. F, tit. V, § 507(d)(2).\nThe appellants allege that the Michigan Catholic Conference Second Amended and Restated Group Health Benefit\nPlan for Employees (“MCC Benefit Plan”) is a health plan. MCC R. 1 (MCC Compl. at ¶ 16) (Page ID #7).\nHowever, it is not clear that the MCC Benefit Plan is an actual plaintiff in this case. The complaint is captioned\n“MICHIGAN CATHOLIC CONFERENCE in its own name and on behalf of the MICHIGAN CATHOLIC\nCONFERENCE SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED GROUP HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN FOR\nEMPLOYEES . . . .” MCC R. 1 (MCC Compl. at 1) (Page ID #1). Although the complaint describes MCC and\nCatholic Charities as “plaintiff[s],” it does not describe the MCC Benefit Plan as a plaintiff. See id. at ¶¶ 16, 17\n(Page ID #7). However, because we affirm the denial of the preliminary injunction on this claim, we need not\ndecide this issue at this time.\n         We also question the appellants’ assumption that MCC is discriminated against for refusing to provide\ncontraceptive coverage. MCC concedes that it is eligible for the religious-employer exemption. MCC R. 1 (Compl.\nat ¶ 9) (Page ID #4). Consequently, its health insurance plan need not cover contraception or emergency\ncontraception. Thus, it is not clear how MCC is discriminated against for refusing to provide contraceptive\ncoverage. See Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6729515</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *46 (holding that the\ncontraceptive-coverage requirement is consistent with the Weldon Amendment for entities that are eligible for the\nexemption or the accommodation).\n\fNos. 13-2723/6640          Mich. Catholic Conf. et al. v. Burwell et al.         Page 29\n\nemergency contraceptives. Because the burden is on the appellants to demonstrate a strong\nlikelihood of success on the merits, and the appellants have neither asserted nor argued nor\npresented evidence that the federal government classifies these drugs as abortifacients, they have\nnot shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claim.\n\n          2. Notice and Comment\n\n          The appellants argue that the government violated the APA because it did not subject the\nIOM recommendation that preventive services include contraceptive coverage to notice and\ncomment rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 553(b). Appellant Br. 66–68. This claim was not\nproperly raised in or decided by the district court, so we decline to address it for the first time on\nappeal.\n\n          As discussed supra, the CDN plaintiffs did not raise any APA claims in their motion for a\npreliminary injunction. The MCC plaintiffs’ only reference to a notice-and-comment claim is a\nsingle sentence in the introduction section of their memorandum in support of the motion for a\npreliminary injunction:      “Finally, the Mandate violates the Administrative Procedure Act\n(‘APA’) because Defendants failed to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking, and it\ncontravenes the clear terms of the Weldon Amendment.” MCC R. 15 (Prelim. Inj. Memo. at 3)\n(Page ID #604). In the argument section of the memorandum the MCC plaintiffs discussed the\nWeldon Amendment issue, but did not return to the notice-and-comment issue. See id. at 44–45\n(Page ID #645–46). The district court did not address the notice-and-comment argument in its\ndecision. See Michigan Catholic Conference, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6838707</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13.\n\n          We generally do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.

Other Factors for Injunctive Relief\n\n       We conclude that the appellants have not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on\nthe merits of any of their properly raised claims. The other three factors that we consider in\nevaluating a request for a preliminary injunction are: (2) whether the movant would suffer\nirreparable injury without the injunction; (3) whether issuance of the injunction would cause\nsubstantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuance of the\ninjunction.

When the alleged\ninjury is to a First Amendment freedom, as here, the strong likelihood of success on the merits\nfactor merges with the irreparable injury factor. “To the extent that [appellant] can establish a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of its First Amendment claim, it also has established the\npossibility of irreparable harm as a result of the deprivation of the claimed free speech rights.”\nConnection Distrib.

Conversely, if appellant\n“does not have a likelihood of success on the merits . . . his argument that he is irreparably\nharmed by the deprivation of his First Amendment right also fails.” McNeilly, 684 F.3d at 615.\nBecause the appellants do not demonstrate a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their\nclaims, they also do not demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable injury without the\ninjunction.\n\n       The district courts did not abuse their discretion by denying preliminary injunctions.\n\n                                      III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district courts’ denial of preliminary\ninjunctions. We lift the stay temporarily issued by this court pending resolution of this appeal.\n\f</pre>",
