Almeda\n\fcounterclaimed for accelerated rent, repayment of rental concessions, and\n\nattorney’s fees. The trial court granted summary judgment in Almeda’s favor,\n\nruling that the appellants take nothing by their claims and awarding Almeda\n\ndamages and attorney’s fees.        On appeal, the appellants bring eight issues\n\ncontesting the trial court’s take-nothing summary judgment on each of their causes\n\nof action and the trial court’s summary judgment for Almeda on its counterclaim.\n\nWe reverse the trial court’s judgment in part as to the award of attorney’s fees. We\n\naffirm the judgment of the trial court in all other respects.\n\n                                     Background\n\n      Steven and Michelle Richardson visited the Equinox Apartments to inquire\n\nabout renting an apartment. The apartment complex is owned by Almeda, and it is\n\nlocated near the medical center in Houston, Texas. The Richardsons met the\n\napartment manager, Susan Franz. During this conversation, they told her that their\n\noccupations—emergency helicopter pilot and emergency room nurse—required\n\nthat they work irregular hours. They therefore required an apartment that would be\n\nquiet enough to allow them to sleep night or day, and they asked if the apartments\n\nwere noisy. Michelle said that Franz “reassured me countless times that it was a\n\nquiet place.” Michelle never put her concerns about noise in writing; Franz never\n\nput her representations that the apartment was quiet in writing, either. According\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fto the Richardsons, Franz recommended apartment 175, a ground-floor apartment\n\nnear a meditation fountain, which she told them would be a quiet area.\n\n      Michelle also had concerns about the security of the apartment complex, and\n\nshe conceded that she knew it was not a crime-free area before she signed the\n\nlease. However, she said that Franz assured her about the safety of the apartment\n\ncomplex saying that “there wasn’t crime,” that “it was a secure property,” and\n\nbecause “it was a gated community . . . the only people that could come in and out\n\nwere with the remote gates . . . .”\n\n      The Richardsons also told Franz that Michelle’s father, Richard Day, would\n\nbe living with them, and that he was a disabled Vietnam veteran. They requested a\n\nground-floor apartment, telling Franz that Day’s back and knee problems required\n\nsuch access as well as an accessible parking spot. Although Day testified that he\n\nhad no input into the choice of the apartment, he testified that the apartment\n\nmanager represented that the apartment was “very quiet, very peaceful” and\n\nsuitable for his needs. Day also told Franz that he would need an accessible\n\nparking spot, and he testified that he had no complaints about the availability of\n\nsuitable parking. Nobody informed Franz or any other representative of Almeda\n\nthat Day suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. None of the appellants ever\n\nmade a written request for accommodations for Day’s disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      The Richardsons and Day all signed the lease agreement. The term of the\n\nlease was from February 9, 2009 to March 29, 2010, and thereafter it would\n\nautomatically continue month-to-month unless either party gave written notice 60\n\ndays before termination. The lease included several provisions that would entitle a\n\ntenant to terminate without penalty, including (1) delay of occupancy caused by\n\nconstruction, repairs, cleaning or a prior resident’s holding over, (2) provisions\n\napplicable to military personnel, (3) breach of certain responsibilities owed by\n\nAlmeda and in accordance with Section 92.056 of the Texas Property Code, and\n\n(4) moving out after giving proper notice at the expiration of a lease term.\n\nHowever, the lease also provided that if those termination provisions did not apply,\n\n“you won’t be released from this Lease Contract for any reason . . . . You will still\n\nbe liable for the entire Lease Contract term if you move out early.”\n\n      Under the lease, failure to pay rent, violation of the lease or any apartment\n\nrules, and abandonment of the apartment are among the actions that would\n\nconstitute default by the resident. The lease provided that “[a]ll monthly rent for\n\nthe rest of the Lease Contract term” would be “accelerated automatically” and\n\nimmediately due if the tenant moved out without consent and without paying all\n\nrent for the entire lease term. The lease specifically stated that Almeda “may\n\nreport unpaid amounts to credit agencies,” and it reserved the right to exercise “all\n\nother legal remedies” in the event of a tenant’s default.\n\n                                          4\n\f      The lease included several other provisions that are relevant to the parties’\n\neventual dispute.   With respect to the tenants’ conduct while living in the\n\napartment, it provided:\n\n      18. COMMUNITY POLICIES OR RULES. You and all guests\n      and occupants must comply with any written apartment rules and\n      community policies, including instructions for care of our property.\n      Our rules are considered part of this Lease Contract. . . .\n\n      19. LIMITATIONS ON CONDUCT. . . . We may exclude from the\n      apartment community guests or others who, in our judgment, have\n      been violating the law, violating this Lease Contract or any apartment\n      rules, or disturbing other residents, neighbors, visitors, or owner\n      representatives. . . .\n\n      20. PROHIBITED CONDUCT. You and your occupants or guests\n      may not engage in the following activities: criminal conduct;\n      behaving in a loud or obnoxious manner; disturbing or threatening the\n      rights, comfort, health, safety, or convenience of others (including our\n      agents and employees) in or near the apartment community . . . .\n\nTwo separate sections of the lease included provisions addressing safety and\n\nsecurity. The following provisions appeared in the section of the lease entitled\n\n“While You’re Living in the Apartment”:\n\n      24. RESIDENT SAFETY AND LOSS. You and all occupants and\n      guests must exercise due care for your own and others’ safety and\n      security, especially in the use of smoke alarms and other detection\n      devices, door and window locks, and other safety or security\n      devices. . . .\n      ....\n\n      Loss. We’re not liable to any resident, guest, or occupant for personal\n      injury or damage, loss of personal property, or business or personal\n      income from any cause, including, but not limited to . . . theft,\n\n                                         5\n\f      negligent or intentional acts of residents, occupants or guests, or\n      vandalism unless otherwise required by law. . . .\n\n      ....\n\n      Crime or Emergency. Dial 911 or immediately call local medical\n      emergency, fire, or police personnel in case of accident, fire, smoke,\n      suspected criminal activity, or other emergency involving imminent\n      harm. You should then contact our representative. You won’t treat\n      any of our security measures as an express or implied warranty of\n      security, or as a guarantee against crime or of reduced risk of crime.\n      Unless otherwise provided by law, we’re not liable to you or any\n      guests or occupants for injury, damage, or loss to person or property\n      caused by criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary,\n      assault, vandalism, or other crimes. . . .\n\nThe section of the lease entitled “Security Guidelines for Residents” included the\n\nfollowing provision:\n\n      36. SECURITY GUIDELINES. We care about your safety and that\n      of other occupants and guests. No security system is failsafe. Even\n      the best system can’t prevent crime. Always act as if security systems\n      don’t exist since they are subject to malfunction, tampering, and\n      human error. We disclaim any express or implied warranties of\n      security. The best safety measures are the ones you perform as a\n      matter of common sense and habit.\n\n(Emphasis in original.) Paragraph 36 also urged adherence to 20 specific crime-\n\nprevention tips listed in the lease agreement.\n\n      In addition, the lease included a merger clause, disclaiming any oral\n\npromises or representations by the apartment’s representatives:\n\n      33. MISCELLANEOUS. Neither we nor any of our representatives\n      have made any oral promises, representations, or agreements. This\n      Lease Contract is the entire agreement between you and us. Our\n      representatives (including management personnel, employees, and\n                                          6\n\f      agents) have no authority to waive, amend, or terminate this Lease\n      Contract or any part of it, unless in writing, and no authority to make\n      promises, representations, or agreements that impose security duties\n      or other obligations on us or our representatives unless in writing. . . .\n      Written notice to or from our managers constitutes notice to or from\n      us. Any person giving a notice under this Lease Contract should\n      retain a copy of the memo, letter, or fax that was given, as well as any\n      fax transmittal verification. Fax or electronic signatures are binding.\n      All notices must be signed. Notices may not be given by email or\n      other electronic transmission.\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\n\n      Initially, Michelle loved the apartment. She said:\n\n      When we moved in, when we first went—I’m not gonna lie, I fell in\n      love with the apartments. They are beautiful. I was very happy to\n      move there, very happy with everything about the apartments. . . .\n      [W]hen we first moved in, it was quiet, before the neighbors moved\n      in. It was nice, wonderful.\n\nBut then, noisy neighbors moved into apartment 174, which was next door to the\n\nappellants’ apartment. According to the Richardsons, the residents of apartment\n\n174 played loud music and hosted parties until the early morning hours. Michelle\n\nalso complained about the noise of sexual activity occurring in the neighboring\n\napartment, which she described as “constant.”\n\n      Neither of the Richardsons ever spoke to the neighbors about the noise or\n\nleft any notes. They did not know if other residents complained of the noise in\n\ntheir vicinity. Day said he spoke to the neighbor about the noise once in passing,\n\nand his neighbor agreed to keep the volume of music lower. But, according to\n\nDay, the neighbor failed to do so.\n                                          7\n\f      The Richardsons contacted apartment management numerous times\n\nregarding their noisy neighbors. They made telephone calls and twice sent letters\n\nwith their rent checks reiterating that they needed a quiet place to sleep because\n\ntheir jobs required them to be alert. They requested help in resolving the issue.\n\nFranz initially asked them not to call the police and to allow management to\n\naddress the noise problem. However, they nevertheless called the police several\n\ntimes about the noisy neighbors. Steven testified in his deposition that he got high\n\nblood pressure as a result of noise in the apartment.\n\n      In addition to the noise, the appellants were also troubled by security issues.\n\nSteven’s motorcycle was stolen from the apartment complex, and the appellants\n\nsometimes noticed people they described as vagrants sleeping in the hallway.\n\n      To address the appellants’ complaints about the noise, Almeda offered them\n\na different apartment, which was on a higher floor and farther from the elevators.\n\nNone of the appellants informed any Almeda representative that Day’s disability\n\nmade this offer unacceptable, nor did they request any other accommodation.\n\nRather, the Richardsons were concerned about the expense of moving to another\n\napartment, which Almeda did not offer to reimburse. Day testified that he felt that\n\nAlmeda was discriminating against him by suggesting that the appellants move to\n\nanother apartment instead of requiring that the neighbors move. Day said, “[H]e\n\nwas the problem, why not ask him to move . . . .”\n\n                                          8\n\f      In September 2009, the appellants vacated their apartment. They did not\n\nprovide written notice in accordance with the lease provisions, but they paid rent in\n\na prorated amount to cover the days they occupied the apartment during that\n\nmonth.\n\n      Almeda secured a new tenant for apartment 175 and sought to collect\n\naccelerated rent and reimbursement for rental concessions that it believed the\n\nappellants owed under the terms of the lease, less the amount it received from the\n\nnew tenant in mitigation of its damages. Almeda engaged National Credit Audit\n\nCorporation (NCAC) to collect the debt. Michelle testified that she sent NCAC a\n\nletter disputing the debt. In the letter, Michelle stated, “I am a disabled person,”\n\nand she argued that Almeda had violated the Fair Housing Act by “tell[ing] us we\n\nhad to move to the third floor.”      Approximately a month later, NCAC sent\n\nMichelle a second letter stating that because she had not responded, “we are now\n\nlegally entitled to assume that you acknowledge the debt but are refusing to pay\n\nvoluntarily.”\n\n      Approximately seven months later, the Richardsons and Day sued NCAC\n\nand Almeda.     They alleged the following causes of action against Almeda:\n\n(1) violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act by (i) engaging in an\n\nunconscionable action or course of action, (ii) making misrepresentations or failing\n\nto disclose information in violation of Section 17.46(b) of the Texas Business &\n\n                                         9\n\fCommerce Code, and (iii) violating the Texas Debt Collection Act; (2) breach of\n\ncontract; (3) constructive eviction; (4) violation of the Texas Fair Housing Act; and\n\n(5) violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act.\n\n      They also alleged that NCAC violated the Texas Debt Collection Practices\n\nAct and the National Fair Debt Collection Practices Act while acting on behalf of\n\nAlmeda. While the appellants later settled with NCAC, they alleged that Almeda\n\nwas liable for NCAC’s actions under an agency theory.           They sought actual\n\ndamages (including out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use, loss of benefit of the\n\nbargain, and costs of medical and psychiatric care), mental anguish damages,\n\nexemplary damages, and attorney’s fees. Almeda counterclaimed to recover the\n\nunpaid accelerated rent, reimbursement for rental concessions, and attorney’s fees.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment on its counterclaim and on each of\n\nthe appellants’ causes of action, challenging one or more elements of each cause of\n\naction on traditional or no-evidence grounds. The trial court granted Almeda’s\n\ntraditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment without specifying the\n\ngrounds upon which it based its ruling. The court awarded Almeda damages as\n\nwell as $8,000 in attorney’s fees incurred in defending the appellants’ claims and\n\n$4,000 in attorney’s fees for prosecuting its breach-of-contract counterclaim. It\n\nalso awarded contingent appellate attorney’s fees in a maximum aggregate amount\n\nof $40,000. Finally, the court dismissed with prejudice each of the appellants’\n\n                                         10\n\fcauses of action against Almeda including the causes of action for violation of the\n\nTexas Debt Collection Act and the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\nThe Richardsons and Day appealed.\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      We review de novo the trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary\n\njudgment. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d\n\n844, 848 (Tex. 2009). The party moving for traditional summary judgment bears\n\nthe burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see also Provident\n\nLife & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215–16 (Tex. 2003). A\n\ndefendant moving for summary judgment must conclusively negate at least one\n\nessential element of each of the plaintiff’s causes of action or conclusively\n\nestablish each element of an affirmative defense. Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez,\n\n941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex. 1997).\n\n      A no-evidence summary judgment is essentially a directed verdict granted\n\nbefore trial, to which we apply a legal-sufficiency standard of review. Mack\n\nTrucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 581–82 (Tex. 2006). Under the no-\n\nevidence summary-judgment rule, the movant may move for summary judgment if,\n\nafter adequate time for discovery, there is no evidence of one or more essential\n\nelements of a claim or defense on which the nonmovant would have the burden of\n\n                                        11\n\fproof at trial. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). The motion must state the elements as to\n\nwhich there is no evidence. Id. The reviewing court must grant the motion unless\n\nthe nonmovant produces summary-judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact. Id.; Mack Trucks, 206 S.W.3d at 582. A genuine issue of material\n\nfact exists if the nonmovant produces evidence that would enable reasonable and\n\nfair-minded jurors to differ in their conclusions. Hamilton v. Wilson, 249 S.W.3d\n\n425, 426 (Tex. 2008) (citing City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 816 (Tex.\n\n2005)).\n\n      I.    Fair Housing Act claims\n\n      In their fourth issue, the appellants allege that the trial court erred by\n\ngranting summary judgment on Day’s claims for violation of the Federal and\n\nTexas Fair Housing Acts. In the first amended petition, Day alleged that Almeda\n\nviolated both fair housing acts by failing to make reasonable accommodations\n\nregarding rules, policies, practices, or services when such accommodation was\n\nnecessary to afford him an equal opportunity to enjoy the premises.\n\n      Under the Federal Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful to discriminate against a\n\nperson “in the terms, conditions, or privileges of . . . rental of a dwelling . . .\n\nbecause of a handicap of . . . that person or . . . a person residing . . . in the\n\ndwelling after it is . . . rented . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2). “[D]iscrimination\n\nincludes . . . a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies,\n\n                                        12\n\fpractices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such\n\nperson equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” Id. § 3604(f)(3)(B). One\n\npurpose of the Texas Fair Housing Act is to “provide rights and remedies\n\nsubstantially equivalent to those granted under federal law.” TEX. PROP. CODE\n\nANN. § 301.002 (West 2013). Under the Texas Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful for\n\na person to discriminate against another “in the terms, conditions, or privileges of .\n\n. . rental of a dwelling . . . because of a disability of . . . the other person [or] a\n\nperson residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is . . . rented . . . .”\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 301.025(b) (West 2007). “[D]iscrimination includes . . .\n\na refusal to make a reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices, or\n\nservices if the accommodation may be necessary to afford the person equal\n\nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling . . . .” Id. § 301.025(c)(2). Implicit in the\n\nconcept of “refusal” is the notion that the plaintiff must make a request for an\n\naccommodation. Cf. Groome Res. Ltd., L.L.C. v. Parish of Jefferson, 234 F.3d\n\n192, 198 (5th Cir. 2000); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (defining\n\ndiscrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act to include “not making\n\nreasonable accommodations”); Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155,\n\n165 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that absent a request from an employee for a\n\nreasonable accommodation, the employer cannot be held liable for failing to\n\nprovide one).\n\n                                            13\n\f      Thus, under both statutes, to prevail on a cause of action for violation of the\n\n“reasonable accommodation” provision, the plaintiff must show that he requested a\n\nreasonable accommodation and the defendant refused to make it. Cf. Groome Res.,\n\n234 F.3d at 198; Taylor, 93 F.3d at 165.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment on the ground that there is no\n\nevidence that it failed to make a reasonable accommodation that was necessary to\n\nafford Day an equal opportunity to enjoy the premises. In response, Day argued\n\nthat the apartment complex knew that he was disabled due to his arthritic knees,\n\nthat he requested an accommodation in the form of an accessible parking spot, and\n\nthat he was deprived of the use of his apartment and the serenity pool area because\n\nof noise. On appeal Day argues that there is a material issue of fact as to whether\n\nAlmeda’s failure to make and enforce rules for use of the serenity pool area and its\n\n“moving [Day] to a much further walk on his arthritic knees” constituted a failure\n\nto make a reasonable accommodation in violation of the state and federal fair\n\nhousing acts.\n\n      As summary-judgment proof, Day provided his affidavit and those of the\n\nRichardsons, which stated that prior to signing the lease, they informed Franz that:\n\n(1) Day is a disabled veteran, (2) he has arthritic knees, (3) he could not walk far\n\nfrom his car to the door, (4) he would require an accessible parking space, (5) he\n\nneeded a ground-floor apartment, and (6) due to his disability, he required quiet.\n\n                                           14\n\fSteven’s deposition testimony also showed that he had informed Franz and another\n\nrepresentative of the apartment complex that Day had a bad back. Steven said they\n\nchose a ground-floor apartment because it would be easier for Day to get around.\n\n      However, in Michelle’s deposition, she specifically testified that she did not\n\ninform the apartment representatives that her father suffered from PTSD. Neither\n\nDay’s deposition excerpt nor Almeda’s interrogatory answers provide any\n\nadditional information about Day’s disability or his fair housing claims. There is\n\nno evidence pertaining to making or enforcing rules for use of the serenity pool,\n\nnor is there evidence that Almeda moved Day to a “much further walk on his\n\narthritic knees.”\n\n      The evidence shows that in response to the appellants’ initial request for a\n\nground-floor apartment, they were given a ground-floor apartment. It also shows\n\nthat Day had an opportunity to use the accessible parking spots and that neither\n\nDay nor the Richardsons ever made any other request for an accommodation for\n\nDay. Rather, in response to Almeda’s offer to allow the appellants to move to\n\nanother apartment, the appellants abandoned the lease without requesting an\n\naccommodation.\n\n      Almeda’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment attacked the element\n\nof failure to make a reasonable accommodation. In light of the conclusive proof\n\nthat there was no request for an accommodation and the complete absence of\n\n                                        15\n\fevidence that the apartment complex refused to make a requested reasonable\n\naccommodation, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary\n\njudgment on Day’s state and federal fair housing causes of action. Cf. Groome\n\nRes., 234 F.3d at 198; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Taylor, 93 F.3d at 165.\n\n      II.    Constructive eviction\n\n      In their fifth issue, the appellants allege that the trial court erred by granting\n\nsummary judgment on their constructive eviction claim. In their first amended\n\npetition, the appellants alleged that their lease included an implied covenant of\n\nquiet enjoyment, which Almeda breached. The petition does not allege any facts\n\nshowing how Almeda constructively evicted the appellants.             “A constructive\n\neviction occurs when the tenant leaves the leased premises due to conduct by the\n\nlandlord which materially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the\n\npremises.” Fidelity Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Robert P. Kaminsky, M.D., P.A., 768\n\nS.W.2d 818, 819 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1989, no writ). “Texas law\n\nrelieves the tenant of contractual liability for any remaining rentals due under the\n\nlease if he can establish a constructive eviction by the landlord.” Id. “Constructive\n\neviction essentially terminates mutuality of obligation as to the lease terms,\n\nbecause the fundamental reason for the lease’s existence has been destroyed by the\n\nlandlord’s conduct.”    Downtown Realty, Inc. v. 509 Tremont Bldg., Inc., 748\n\nS.W.2d 309, 313 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1988, no writ). The elements\n\n                                          16\n\fof a cause of action for constructive eviction are (1) an intention on the part of the\n\nlandlord that the tenant shall no longer enjoy the premises, (2) a material act by the\n\nlandlord that substantially interferes with the tenant’s intended use and enjoyment\n\nof the premises, (3) an act that permanently deprives the tenant of the use and\n\nenjoyment of the premises, and (4) abandonment of the premises by the tenant\n\nwithin a reasonable time after the commission of the act. Lazell v. Stone, 123\n\nS.W.3d 6, 11–12 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\n\n      The landlord’s intent may be inferred from the circumstances. Id. at 12. For\n\nexample, in Lazell, this court held that changing the locks and informing a\n\ncommercial tenant that she is not welcome on the property when rent was only a\n\nfew days late and no notice of default had been given was evidence of the\n\nlandlord’s intent to constructively evict the tenant. See id. at 8, 12.\n\n      In Columbia/HCA v. Tea Cake French Bakery & Tea Room, 8 S.W.3d 18\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied), HCA purchased land and a\n\nshopping center in a location where it intended to build a hospital. 8 S.W.3d at 19.\n\nHCA negotiated early termination of all the shopping center tenants’ leases, except\n\nfor that of Tea Cake. Id. HCA began construction of the hospital before the\n\nexpiration of Tea Cake’s lease but without demolishing the shopping center. Id.\n\nOn appeal from a directed verdict on Tea Cake’s constructive eviction claim, the\n\ncourt of appeals held that there was a question of fact because (1) the landlord paid\n\n                                           17\n\ftenants to leave the premises, (2) the shopping center was nearly vacant, and\n\n(3) the near vacancy of the shopping center destroyed a significant portion of Tea\n\nCake’s walk-in business. Id. at 22.\n\n      However, in Quitta v. Fossati, 808 S.W.2d 636 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n1991, writ denied), the court of appeals held that the landlord’s threat to “get the\n\nsheriff” to evict the tenants was not evidence of constructive eviction. 808 S.W.2d\n\nat 643. The court explained that there must be evidence of “some additional\n\nfeature, such as harassing incidents disturbing to the tenant’s peaceful possession\n\nand occurring on the property.” Id.\n\n      Among other grounds, Almeda moved for summary judgment on this cause\n\nof action because there was no evidence of intent. In response, the appellants\n\nsubmitted their own affidavits and Steven’s deposition testimony. The affidavits\n\nshow that all three appellants were troubled by the noise and that complaints to the\n\napartment complex sometimes resulted in a temporary cessation of noise but\n\nsometimes brought no relief. In addition, the affidavits and deposition testimony\n\nshowed that rather than requiring the neighbors to be quiet, the apartment complex\n\noffered the appellants an opportunity to move to another apartment at their own\n\nexpense. The evidence does not show that the apartment complex in any way\n\nrequired the appellants to move or otherwise disturbed their possession of the\n\napartment. That Almeda offered the appellants an alternative apartment is not\n\n                                        18\n\fevidence that they were being deprived of their leased apartment or that Almeda\n\nintended to evict them. We overrule this issue.\n\n      III.   Texas Debt Collection Practices Act\n\n      In their sixth issue, the appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting\n\nsummary judgment on their claims for violation of the Texas Debt Collection\n\nPractices Act. See TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. §§ 392.001–.404 (West 2006). In their\n\nfirst amended petition, they alleged that NCAC, acting as an agent for Almeda,\n\nviolated the TDCPA by: (1) misrepresenting or threatening to misrepresent to\n\nanother person that they willfully refused to pay a nondisputed consumer debt\n\nwhen the debt was in dispute and the NCAC had been notified in writing of the\n\ndispute, see id. § 392.301(a)(3); (2) threatening to take actions prohibited by law,\n\nsee id. § 392.301(a)(8); and (3) misrepresenting the character, extent, or amount of\n\na consumer debt, see id. § 392.304(a)(8). They also alleged that they suffered\n\nactual damages and mental anguish, but the pleading did not provide any specific\n\nfacts pertaining to these elements of damages.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment asserting, among other grounds, that\n\nthere was no evidence that the appellants suffered any injury as a result of the\n\nalleged violations of the TDCPA. In response to Almeda’s traditional motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the appellants attached an unsworn amended response to a\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\frequest for disclosure which included the following factual statements pertaining to\n\ndamages:\n\n            Plaintiffs Steven and Michelle Richardson incurred moving\n      expenses of $10,000.00. From September 7, 2009 through March 1,\n      2010 (the latter date being the day the lease ended) Plaintiff Steven\n      Richardson incurred commute expenses of $2,000.00. Plaintiff\n      Michelle Richardson incurred additional commute expenses of\n      $1,500.00. Plaintiff Steven Richardson’s motorcycle at the time of its\n      theft had a fair market value of $8,500.00. Plaintiff Steven\n      Richardson has incurred medical expenses in excess of $1,000.00.\n      The apartment we paid for cost $1777.00 per month and was\n      worthless. We paid rent, including the prorated portion of the month\n      we moved out, in the amount of $10,789.00. Plaintiff Michelle\n      Richardson and Plaintiff Steven Richardson suffered overlapping\n      economic damages in the amount [of] $33,786.00.\n\n            Plaintiff Richard Day suffered $2,000.00 in damages for\n      increased commuter costs.\n\n      In response to Almeda’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment as to\n\ntheir TDCPA claim, the appellants did not respond to the contention that there was\n\nno evidence of damages.       Even considering the appellants’ response to the\n\ntraditional motion for summary judgment on the element of TDCPA damages, we\n\nconclude that there is no evidence of damages from a violation of the TDCPA\n\nbecause the appellants’ unsworn discovery disclosure includes no factual allegation\n\nof any harm resulting from the alleged TDCPA violation, and in any case it is not\n\ncompetent summary-judgment evidence. See Schulz v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\n\nCo., 930 S.W.2d 872, 876 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ)\n\n(“Answers to interrogatories and discovery responses may only be used against the\n                                        20\n\fparty who answered them.”). We hold that the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment as to the appellants’ TDCPA claim. We overrule this issue.\n\n      IV.    Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n\n      In their seventh issue, the appellants argue that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment on their claims for violation of the Federal Fair Debt\n\nCollection Practices Act. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692–1692p. In their first amended\n\npetition, the appellants alleged that NCAC, while acting on behalf of Almeda:\n\n(1) violated 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(a)(2) by “misrepresenting the character or amount\n\nof a consumer debt” because they owed nothing or were excused from performing\n\nunder the lease by Almeda’s prior breach; (2) violated 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e)(a)(5)\n\nby “threatening to take action that cannot be legally taken or that was not intended\n\nto be taken” by threatening to report the debt as undisputed when they previously\n\ninformed NCAC in writing that they disputed the debt; and (3) violated 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1692e(a)(8) by “threatening to communicate false credit information, including\n\nthat the failure to communicate that a disputed debt is disputed,” specifically by\n\nstating in the February 17, 2010 collection letter that it intended to report the debt\n\nas undisputed to credit agencies. The appellants further alleged that they suffered\n\nactual damages including mental anguish as a result of the violations of the Federal\n\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f       The February 17, 2010 letter that forms the basis of the appellants’ debt\n\ncollection claims was addressed only to Michelle. In the subject line it identified\n\n“Equinox Apt 175,” showed a file number, and stated a balance of $3,257.30. The\n\nletter stated:\n\n             We have corresponded with you previously, concerning the\n       above referenced account.\n\n            Unfortunately, you have failed to respond in a timely manner.\n       As a consequence, we are now legally entitled to assume that you\n       acknowledge the debt but are refusing to pay voluntarily.\n\n              My client expects me to pursue all available legal remedies to\n       effect collection of your account. I urge you to make additional\n       collection efforts unnecessary by remitting the balance or contacting\n       me immediately to discuss payment options. . . . For your\n       convenience, we can accept at no additional cost, checks by phone,\n       Western Union Quick Collect, credit and debit cards.\n\n             Further procrastination on your part will only result in greater\n       expense as well as other undesirable consequences. Act now to\n       protect your credit. I will allow 7 days for your response.\n\nThe bottom of the letter read, “This is an attempt to collect a debt.           Any\n\ninformation obtained will be used for that purpose.”\n\n       Almeda moved for traditional summary judgment on the grounds that it is\n\nnot a debt collector and the appellants were not injured. Almeda also argued that\n\neven if it were a debt collector, there still was no evidence that it used a false,\n\ndeceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fof a debt against the appellants, or that the appellants were injured as a result of the\n\nalleged conduct.\n\n      The Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits a debt collector\n\nfrom using “any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in\n\nconnection with the collection of any debt.” 15 U.S.C. § 1692e. A prevailing\n\nplaintiff may recover actual damages, additional damages up to $1,000, costs, and\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees for prosecuting the civil action. Id. § 1692k. “Actual\n\ndamages can include damages for emotional distress, out-of-pocket expenses,\n\npersonal humiliation, embarrassment, or mental anguish.” Agueros v. Hudson &\n\nKeyse, LLC, No. 04-09-00449-CV, 2010 WL 3418286, at *6 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio Aug. 31, 2010, no pet.) (citing Harrington v. Nat’l Enter. Sys., Inc., No.\n\n4:08cv422, 2010 WL 890176, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 9, 2010)). However, the\n\ndebtor must prove he suffered some specific loss to recover actual damages. Id.\n\n“Generally, an award of mental anguish damages must be supported by direct\n\nevidence that the nature, duration, and severity of mental anguish was sufficient to\n\ncause, and caused, either a substantial disruption in the plaintiff’s daily routine or a\n\nhigh degree of mental pain and distress.” Serv. Corp. Int’l v. Guerra, 348 S.W.3d\n\n221, 231 (Tex. 2011). Thus “evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of the\n\nmental anguish is required.” Id. To overcome Almeda’s no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the appellants must have produced some evidence that, as a\n\n                                          23\n\fresult of the allegedly improper debt collection activities, they each suffered “a\n\nhigh degree of mental pain and distress” that is “more than mere worry, anxiety,\n\nvexation, embarrassment, or anger,” or that substantially disrupted their routines.\n\nSee Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 444 (Tex. 1995).\n\n       First, the record shows that the allegedly improper debt collection letter was\n\naddressed and sent only to Michelle, not to Steven or her father. However, the\n\nappellants all produced affidavits to support their allegations that they were injured\n\nas a result of the alleged violations of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices\n\nAct.\n\n       Steven’s affidavit in relevant part primarily addressed injuries resulting from\n\nthe noise he encountered at the apartment complex and his subsequent move. That\n\nportion of the affidavit did not show that any of his claimed economic damages\n\nresulted from the debt collection actions, about which he said:\n\n       13. As a result of National Credit Audit Corporation trying to\n       collect an invalid debt from me, threatening to take legal action they\n       could not take, and threatening to report the debt as undisputed,\n       caused me to suffer even more indignation and embarrassment\n       causing further disruption of my daily routine. I was caused to feel\n       constantly indignant, tense, disgusted, physically ill, and upset.\n\nHowever, these statements are conclusory because they lack factual support as to\n\nthe nature, duration, or extent of the stated emotional distress or how his daily\n\nroutine was disrupted. Therefore, these statements are insufficient to overcome a\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fno-evidence challenge to the element of injury as to Steven. See Serv. Corp. Int’l,\n\n348 S.W.3d at 231; Parkway Co., 901 S.W.2d at 444.\n\n      Likewise, Michelle’s affidavit described the bothersome noise and its\n\nimpacts on her family, as well as the costs associated with vacating the apartment.\n\nShe specifically addressed the debt collection activities, saying:\n\n              As a result of [NCAC] trying to collect an invalid debt from us,\n      threatening to take legal action they could not take, and threatening to\n      report the debt as undisputed, caused me to suffer even more\n      indignation and embarrassment causing further disruption of my daily\n      routine. I was caused to feel constantly indignant, tense, disgusted,\n      physically ill, and upset. The debt was invalid because they breached\n      the contract first and also forced us to move out. They threatened to\n      represent that the debt was undisputed because . . . the letter states that\n      we failed to ‘timely respond’ and they could ‘assume’ our\n      acknowledgement of the debt but are refusing to pay voluntarily.\n      They therefore, also threatened to take action they legally could not\n      take. They also threatened to report it to a credit bureau. This letter,\n      just like their previous letter, misrepresented the extent or nature of a\n      debt, because of [Almeda’s] conduct, we did not owe them anything.\n\n      The exact same paragraph appears in Day’s affidavit, and it, too, is his only\n\nevidence of injury sustained as a result of the debt collection practices. As with\n\nSteven’s affidavit, these statements are conclusory because they lack factual\n\nsupport as to the nature, duration, or extent of the alleged emotional distress or\n\nhow their daily routines were disrupted.           Therefore, these statements are\n\ninsufficient to overcome a no-evidence challenge to the element of injury as to\n\nMichelle and Day. See Serv. Corp. Int’l, 348 S.W.3d at 231; Parkway Co., 901\n\nS.W.2d at 444.\n                                          25\n\f      Because there is no evidence upon which a reasonable fact finder could find\n\nthat any of the appellants suffered damages as a result of the allegedly improper\n\ndebt collection practices, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment as to the FDCPA claim. We overrule this issue.\n\n      V.     Breach of contract\n\n      In their second and third issues, the appellants challenge the trial court’s\n\nsummary-judgment rulings on their cause of action for breach of contract and on\n\nAlmeda’s counterclaim for breach of contract.\n\n             A. The appellants’ contract claim\n\n      In their first amended petition, the appellants alleged that Almeda breached\n\nthe lease agreement based upon the following events: (1) Almeda represented that\n\nthe apartment would be suitable for the appellants and that there had been no\n\nreports of theft; (2) the appellants were disturbed by noise from the neighboring\n\napartment during late hours of the night and early hours of the morning; (3)\n\nAlmeda proposed that the appellants move to a different apartment on a higher\n\nfloor of the apartment building; (4) Steven’s motorcycle was stolen from the\n\napartment complex; and (5) the noise, theft of personal property, and\n\n“discrimination on the basis of disability” constituted constructive eviction.\n\n      Almeda inquired about the breach-of-contract allegations during each\n\nappellant’s deposition. Michelle testified that Almeda breached the part of the\n\n                                         26\n\fcontract that required them to “provide a quiet environment, safe environment.”\n\nSteven testified that he believed Almeda breached its contract by failing to resolve\n\ntheir noise complaints. He said he did not know which provision of the contract\n\nwas breached in this way, but he said, “There’s a clause in there that talks about\n\nthe right to peace and quiet and things like that. . . . [T]here’s something in there\n\nthat references the fact that if there’s a problem, this is the way you should notify\n\nthe management company and do it in writing, and we did that. And, also, we\n\nmade the verbal requests and things of such, and there was no resolve ever\n\noffered.” Day testified that he believed Almeda breached the lease by suggesting\n\nthat the appellants move instead of suggesting that the noisy neighbors move and\n\nby failing to give them a quiet place.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment on grounds that (1) the appellants did\n\nnot perform or tender performance under the lease and were not excused from\n\nperformance, (2) none of the allegations against Almeda constitute a breach of the\n\nlease, and (3) there is no evidence that (i) the appellants performed, tendered\n\nperformance, or were excused from performing their obligations under the lease,\n\n(ii) Almeda breached the lease, or (iii) the appellants were injured by any alleged\n\nbreach of the lease by Almeda. In response to the motion, the appellants argued,\n\namong other things, that they performed under the lease until they were\n\nconstructively evicted and that the constructive eviction excused further\n\n                                         27\n\fperformance under the lease. They also argued that Almeda breached the contract\n\nby breaching the implied covenant of quiet use and enjoyment and by failing to\n\ncomply with fair housing laws.\n\n      The essential elements of a breach-of-contract claim are: (1) the existence of\n\na valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff;\n\n(3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages sustained by the\n\nplaintiff as a result of the breach. Luccia v. Ross, 274 S.W.3d 140, 146 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). “A breach of the covenant of quiet\n\nenjoyment requires an eviction, actual or constructive, brought about by the acts of\n\nthe landlord, those acting for the landlord, or those acting with the landlord’s\n\npermission.” Holmes v. P.K. Pipe & Tubing, Inc., 856 S.W.2d 530, 539 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, no writ). We have already held that the trial court\n\ndid not err by granting summary judgment on the appellants’ cause of action for\n\nconstructive eviction. “In the absence of constructive eviction, there can be no\n\nbreach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.” Id. at 541. Therefore, we hold that\n\nthe appellants’ summary-judgment evidence does not create a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to Almeda’s alleged breach of the implied covenant of quiet use\n\nand enjoyment. See id.\n\n      The appellants correctly state that the lease required Almeda to\n\n“substantially comply with all applicable laws regarding . . . fair housing.”\n\n                                        28\n\fHowever, we have already held that the trial court did not err by granting summary\n\njudgment as to the appellants’ fair housing causes of action because there is no\n\nevidence that Almeda refused to make a requested accommodation. We likewise\n\nconclude that there is no evidence that Almeda breached the lease by failing to\n\nsubstantially comply with all applicable laws regarding fair housing.\n\n      Finally, the evidence is undisputed that the appellants did not provide\n\nwritten notice of their intention to vacate the apartment 60 days in advance and that\n\nthey did not pay the full amount of rent due through the end of the lease term.\n\nBecause the appellants did not fully perform under the contract and because their\n\nnon-performance was not excused by constructive eviction, we conclude that there\n\nis no genuine issue of material fact as to that element of the appellants’ breach-of-\n\ncontract claim.\n\n      We hold that the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment on the\n\nappellants’ breach-of-contract cause of action, and we overrule this issue.\n\n             B. Almeda’s contract counterclaim\n\n      In its first amended counterclaim, Almeda alleged that the appellants\n\nbreached the lease by vacating the premises before the expiration of the lease term\n\nwithout giving 60 days’ notice and without paying the accelerated rent and other\n\namounts that were due under the lease. Almeda moved for traditional summary\n\njudgment on its counterclaim, attaching as evidence the appellants’ original\n\n                                         29\n\fpetition, the lease agreement, an affidavit from Susan Franz, a copy of a resident\n\nledger showing amounts paid on the appellants’ account, and transcripts from the\n\nappellents’ depositions. In response, the appellants argued that their breach of the\n\nlease was excused by Almeda’s breach of its implied covenant of quiet use and\n\nenjoyment. The appellants proffered evidence to support their contentions that\n\ntheir neighbors were noisy, that the noise was troublesome to them and caused\n\nthem stress, that they complained to apartment management about the noise, and\n\nthat management offered them an alternative apartment on a higher floor. They\n\nfurther argued that there was no evidence that Almeda “attempted to move, evict,\n\nor otherwise remedy the noise violations vis a vis the noisy neighbors in the\n\nadjacent apartment.” The appellants also argued about the rental concessions,\n\nstating that Almeda’s motion for summary judgment failed to “state how paragraph\n\n32 of the parties’ lease agreement justifies the concession charges charged by\n\n[Almeda] and therefore fails to provide adequate notice on what basis summary\n\njudgment is sought.” The appellants did not provide any evidence pertinent to the\n\nissue of concession fees.\n\n      We have already held that there is no genuine issue of material fact on the\n\nappellants’ cause of action for breach of contract based on a breach of the implied\n\ncovenant of quiet use and enjoyment. See Holmes, 856 S.W.2d at 541. The\n\nappellants brought forth no evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\n                                         30\n\fthe justification for the rental concession charges. Thus, the trial court’s summary\n\njudgment as to Almeda’s breach-of-contract counterclaim is proper if Almeda’s\n\nsummary-judgment evidence shows that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see also Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 128\n\nS.W.3d at 215–16.\n\n      It is undisputed that the appellants signed the lease agreement. It is also\n\nundisputed that the lease expired March 29, 2010, and that the appellants vacated\n\nthe apartment in September 2009 without providing 60 days’ written notice and\n\nwithout Almeda’s consent. There is neither evidence nor argument that any of the\n\nother contractual justifications for termination of the lease apply in this case, other\n\nthan those that we have already held to be unavailing. Franz’s affidavit shows that\n\nthe appellants owed $3,955.11 for accelerated rent and reimbursement of rental\n\nconcessions based on (i) the date of their departure, (ii) their monthly rent, (iii) the\n\ndate when a new tenant moved into the vacated apartment, mitigating Almeda’s\n\ndamages, and (iv) credits for prorated September 2009 rent paid by the appellants\n\nand other deposits. The trial court rendered summary judgment in Almeda’s favor\n\nfor the amount of $3,955.11. We hold that it did not err in doing so, and we\n\noverrule this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f   VI.   DTPA claims\n\n      In their first issue, the appellants challenge the trial court’s summary-\n\njudgment ruling on their causes of action for violation of the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practices Act. In their first amended petition, the appellants alleged that\n\nAlmeda violated the DTPA by (1) engaging in an unconscionable action or course\n\nof action, TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. §§ 17.45(5) & 17.50(a)(3) (West 2011);\n\n(2) engaging in false, misleading, or decetive acts or practices in the conduct of\n\ntrade or commerce by (i) representing that goods or services have sponsorship,\n\napproval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities which they do\n\nnot have, id. § 17.46(b)(5), (ii) representing that an agreement concerning goods or\n\nservices confers or involves rights, remedies, or obligations which it does not have\n\nor involve, id. § 17.46(b)(12), and (iii) failing to disclose information concerning\n\ngoods or services which was known at the time of the transaction with the intention\n\nto induce the consumer into a transaction into which the consumer would not have\n\nentered had the information been disclosed id. § 17.46(b)(24); and (3) by engaging\n\nin false, misleading, or deceptive acts prohibited by the Texas Debt Collection Act,\n\nsee TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. § 392.404(a). The appellants did not specify which\n\nstatements or actions formed the basis for each alleged misrepresentation or\n\nunconscionable act, and Almeda did not specially except to the pleading.\n\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\f      Almeda moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) as a matter of\n\nlaw, a merger clause in the lease agreement negated any assertion of\n\nmisrepresentation, and (2) the lease agreement expressly disclaimed the existence\n\nof express or implied warranties. Almeda also moved on the grounds that there\n\nwas no evidence that it: (3) engaged in a false, misleading, or deceptive act or\n\npractice that is specifically enumerated in section 17.46(b) of the DTPA;\n\n(4) breached an express or implied warranty; (5) engaged in an unconscionable\n\naction or course of action; or (6) engaged in any action that was a producing cause\n\nof any damages suffered by the Richardsons or Day.\n\n      In   response,   the   appellants   alleged   that   the   following   Almeda\n\nmisrepresentations are actionable as violations of section 17.46(b)(5): (1) that “the\n\napartment they were renting provided the safe, quiet environment they specifically\n\nrequired”; (2) that “the apartment was free from extraneous noise to the extent that\n\nPlaintiffs would obtain sufficient rest to perform their occupations”; and (3) that “a\n\nlocation near the serenity pool would provide even greater degree of quiet.” The\n\nappellants further argued that the following Almeda misrepresentations are\n\nactionable as violations of section 17.46(b)(12): (1) that Almeda told the appellants\n\nthey could do nothing about noise violations and (2) that “if Plaintiffs wanted quiet\n\nenjoyment of their lease they had to move to another floor at their expense for even\n\nhigher rent.” But as to alleged violations of section 17.46(b)(24), the appellants\n\n                                          33\n\fdid not identify any specific statements or actions as violating this provision. The\n\nappellants argued that Almeda further engaged in the following unconscionable\n\nactions or course of actions: (1) representing at the time of the transaction that the\n\napartment would be quiet enough for them to obtain rest needed to perform their\n\noccupations; (2) representing that the area near the serenity pool would “enhance\n\nthe placidity” and “provide suitable lack of noise”; (3) representing that there was a\n\nlack of criminal activity on the premises; (4) refusing to properly address noise\n\ncomplaints; (5) failing to conduct an adequate investigation; (6) refusing to enforce\n\nrules or policies contained in the lease; and (7) misrepresenting to the appellants\n\nthat their sole remedy was to move to another apartment on another floor at greater\n\nexpense and at the appellants’ inconvenience.\n\n      “The DTPA grants consumers a cause of action for false, misleading, or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices.” Amstadt v. U.S. Brass Corp., 919 S.W.2d 644, 649\n\n(Tex. 1996); TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 17.50(a)(1) (West 2011). To prevail\n\nunder the DTPA, a plaintiff must show that (1) he was a consumer; (2) the use or\n\nemployment of a false, misleading or deceptive act or practice that is either (i) a\n\nspecifically enumerated “laundry-list” violation under DTPA section 17.46(b) on\n\nwhich he detrimentally relied or (ii) any unconscionable action or course of action;\n\nand (3) the wrongful act was a producing cause of his economic or mental-anguish\n\ndamages. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 17.50.\n\n                                         34\n\f      First, to the extent that the appellants’ DTPA claims are based on violation\n\nof the Texas Debt Collection Practices Act, in light of our holdings as to\n\nconstructive eviction, breach of contract, and violation of the Texas Debt\n\nCollection Practices Act, we further hold that the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment as to any DTPA claims based on this tie-in statute.\n\n      Second, as to the representations made prior to or contemporaneous with the\n\nsigning of the lease, the appellants brought forth no evidence to refute Almeda’s\n\nno-evidence motion for summary judgment. Generally, an act is false, misleading,\n\nor deceptive if it has the capacity to deceive an “ignorant, unthinking, or credulous\n\nperson.” Doe v. Boys Clubs of Greater Dallas, Inc., 907 S.W.2d 472, 479–80 (Tex.\n\n1995) (quoting Spradling v. Williams, 566 S.W.2d 561, 562 (Tex. 1978)). Absent\n\nevidence that the defendant’s statement was false, a DTPA action for\n\nmisrepresentation cannot survive summary judgment.           Id.; see Pennington v.\n\nSingleton, 606 S.W.2d 682, 687 (Tex. 1980) (finding assertions that an engine\n\nhousing was in “excellent” and “perfect” condition were actionable under the\n\nDTPA because they misrepresented its actual characteristics). The DTPA’s\n\npurpose in making misrepresentations actionable is “to ensure that descriptions of\n\ngoods or services offered for sale are accurate.” Id.; Pennington, 606 S.W.2d at\n\n687. While the appellants correctly note that there is no requirement that Almeda\n\nor its representative have knowledge of the falsity of the statement to be actionable\n\n                                         35\n\funder the DTPA, the statement still must be shown to have been false. See Doe,\n\n907 S.W.2d at 479–80. The appellants’ summary-judgment evidence shows only\n\nthat, more than a month after they moved in, the apartment was not quiet or free\n\nfrom crime. There was no evidence that the apartment was noisy or that the\n\napartment complex was unsafe or not secure when Franz allegedly made the\n\nrepresentations about noise and security. Because there was no evidence that\n\nFranz’s alleged statements were false, the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment on this basis. Id.\n\n      Third, as to the appellants’ allegations that Almeda violated the DTPA by\n\nengaging in an unconscionable action or course of action by not investigating their\n\ncomplaints, not enforcing community rules, and offering them an alternative\n\napartment, we likewise conclude that the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment. “‘Unconscionable action or course of action’ means an act or\n\npractice which, to a consumer’s detriment, takes advantage of the lack of\n\nknowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of the consumer to a grossly unfair\n\ndegree.” TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. §17.45(5). Unconscionability under the\n\nDTPA is an objective standard for which scienter is irrelevant. See Chastain v.\n\nKoonce, 700 S.W.2d 579, 583 (Tex. 1985); see also Bradford v. Vento, 48 S.W.3d\n\n749, 760 (Tex. 2001); Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Morris, 981 S.W.2d 667, 677 (Tex.\n\n1998). To be actionable under the statutory standard, the defendant must have\n\n                                        36\n\ftaken advantage of the consumer “to a grossly unfair degree,” meaning that “the\n\nresulting unfairness was glaringly noticeable, flagrant, complete and unmitigated.”\n\nChastain, 700 S.W.2d at 583–84. This determination is made “by examining the\n\nentire transaction and not by inquiring whether the defendant intended to take\n\nadvantage of the consumer or acted with knowledge or conscious indifference.”\n\nId. at 583.\n\n      The appellants’ summary-judgment evidence on this issue included\n\naffidavits from the Richardsons and Day stating that Almeda refused to address\n\ntheir issue with the noisy neighbors. Michelle testified that Almeda “would require\n\nus to move at our expense and inconvenience.”         They also offered Steven’s\n\ndeposition testimony describing the noise issues and how that made the apartment\n\nunusable. However, the portions of his deposition testimony proffered in response\n\nto both the traditional and no-evidence motions for summary judgment did not\n\naddress any actions taken by Almeda. Similarly, the portions of Day’s deposition\n\nthat the appellants relied upon to refute Almeda’s no-evidence motion say nothing\n\nabout the actions of the apartment complex. Finally, the appellants also produced\n\nleases for their neighbors’ apartments, which contain the same boilerplate\n\nprovisions regarding limitations on conduct, such as a prohibition against behaving\n\nin “a loud or obnoxious manner.” However, the leases all also say that Almeda\n\n“may” exclude guests or others who “in our judgment” violate the lease or\n\n                                        37\n\fapartment rules. Though the appellants’ evidence shows that Almeda declined to\n\nexclude or evict the noisy neighbors, in light of the discretion afforded in the lease\n\ncontract, none of the appellants’ evidence shows that Almeda took advantage of\n\nthe appellants “to a grossly unfair degree,” See id. at 583–84. Accordingly, we\n\nhold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on this ground,\n\nand we overrule the appellants’ first issue.\n\n   VII. Attorney’s fees\n\n      In their eighth issue, the appellants challenge the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Almeda. In its motion for summary judgment, Almeda argued\n\nthat it had incurred “approximately $8,000.00 in reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees defending against Plaintiffs’ claims and $4,000.00 in reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees prosecuting [its] counterclaims.” Almeda attached\n\nthe affidavit of its attorney, James Muska, to support its fees claim. Muska’s\n\naffidavit described the actions taken in the course of his representation. He also\n\nattested that his hourly rate is $175 and that he spent approximately 68 hours\n\nworking on the matter, with approximately 46 hours spent “defending against\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims asserted in this action” and approximately 22 hours “for\n\nprosecuting Defendant’s counterclaims.” Finally, he attested to a total of $40,000\n\nin contingent appellate attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f      In response, the appellants produced no controverting evidence, but they\n\nargued that Almeda was not entitled to attorney’s fees on its counterclaim because\n\nit was not entitled to prevail on that claim. They also argued that Almeda was not\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees for defending against their claims because the evidence\n\nwas insufficient to establish that contractual and noncontractual claims were\n\ninextricably intertwined.\n\n      First, although the appellants challenge the full $12,000 award of trial\n\nattorney’s fees, they made no challenge to the $4,000 award for the counterclaim\n\nexcept to say that Almeda was not entitled to such fees unless it prevailed. Under\n\nTexas law, a party may recover reasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or\n\ncorporation, in addition to the amount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for\n\nbreach of an oral or written contract. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 38.001(8) (West 2008). The lease provided certain remedies upon a tenant’s\n\ndefault, including recovery of costs and attorney’s fees:\n\n      Unless a party is seeking exemplary, punitive, sentimental, or\n      personal-injury damages, the prevailing party may recover from the\n      non-prevailing party attorney’s fees and all other litigation costs. We\n      [Almeda] may recover attorney’s fees in connection with enforcing\n      our rights under this Lease Contract.\n\nBecause the summary-judgment evidence does not create a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to the award of $4,000 in attorney’s fees for prosecution of its\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fbreach-of-contract counterclaim, we hold that the trial court did not err in\n\nrendering such judgment.\n\n      Second, we consider the award of $8,000 in trial attorney’s fees for\n\ndefending against the appellants’ claims. In its first amended answer, Almeda\n\nalleged that the appellants’ DTPA claims, TDCPA claims, and fair housing act\n\nclaims were brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. However,\n\nAlmeda made no mention in its motion for summary judgment of entitlement to\n\nattorney’s fees as a sanction. Thus, the trial court’s summary judgment for $8,000\n\nis not supportable on the ground that it is a sanction. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c)\n\n(“Issues not expressly presented to the trial court by written motion, answer or\n\nother response shall not be considered on appeal as grounds for reversal.”).\n\n      Thus, we must determine if Almeda’s summary-judgment proof established\n\nits entitlement to the $8,000 attorney’s fee award. Cf. McConnell v. Southside\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 343 (Tex. 1993) (“[S]ummary judgments must\n\nstand or fall on their own merits, and the non-movant’s failure to answer or\n\nrespond cannot supply by default the summary judgment proof necessary to\n\nestablish the movant’s right.”).    The general rule is that fee claimants must\n\n“segregate fees between claims for which they are recoverable and claims for\n\nwhich they are not.” Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311\n\n(Tex. 2006). Relying on Stewart Title Guaranty Co. v. Aiello, 941 S.W.2d 68\n\n                                         40\n\f(Tex. 1997), Almeda argues it is entitled to all of its attorney’s fees because all of\n\nthe claims rely on “essentially the same facts.” See 941 S.W.2d at 73. The\n\nSupreme Court of Texas has held that “when the causes of action involved in the\n\nsuit are dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances and thus are\n\n‘interwined to the point of being inseparable,’ the party suing for attorney’s fees\n\nmay recover the entire amount covering all claims.” Stewart Title Guar. Co. v.\n\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Tex. 1991); accord Aiello, 941 S.W.3d at 73.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court of Texas modified this holding in Tony Gullo Motors\n\nI, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299 (Tex. 2006), in which it held, “Intertwined facts\n\ndo not make tort fees recoverable; it is only when discrete legal services advance\n\nboth a recoverable and unrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they\n\nneed not be segregated.” 212 S.W.3d at 313–14. The Court noted:\n\n      But Sterling was certainly correct that many if not most legal fees in\n      such cases cannot and need not be precisely allocated to one claim or\n      the other. Many of the services involved in preparing a contract or\n      DTPA claim for trial must still be incurred if tort claims are appended\n      to it; adding the latter claims does not render the former services\n      unrecoverable. Requests for standard disclosures, proof of background\n      facts, depositions of the primary actors, discovery motions and\n      hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of other services may be\n      necessary whether a claim is filed alone or with others. To the extent\n      such services would have been incurred on a recoverable claim alone,\n      they are not disallowed simply because they do double service.\n\nId. at 313.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\f      The summary-judgment evidence in this case affirmatively demonstrates\n\nthat some discrete legal services were rendered only for claims for which\n\nattorney’s fees are not recoverable. For example, Muska’s affidavit attests that he\n\nreviewed DTPA demand letters and conferred with his client about the allegations\n\nin them. The DTPA provides that “[e]ach consumer who prevails shall be awarded\n\ncourt costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees.” TEX. BUS. & COM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 17.50. But the statute makes no other provision for attorney’s fees\n\nfor defending a non-frivolous DTPA claim. The same is true for the Fair Housing\n\nAct and Debt Collection Act claims.          Because Almeda’s summary-judgment\n\nevidence shows discrete legal services rendered for some claims for which\n\nattorney’s fees are unrecoverable, yet does not show segregation of attorney’s fees\n\nbetween recoverable and non-recoverable claims, we hold that the trial court erred\n\nin awarding $8,000 in attorney’s fees for defending against all of the appellants’\n\nclaims.   See Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313–14.           Because Almeda\n\nprevailed in its motion for summary judgment on the appellants’ breach-of-\n\ncontract claim, and the lease specifically provided that “the prevailing party may\n\nrecover from the non-prevailing party attorney’s fees,” remand is appropriate. See\n\nSilver Lion, Inc. v. Dolphin St., Inc., No. 01-07-00370-CV, 2010 WL 2025749, at\n\n*18 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] May 20, 2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.)\n\n(holding that defendant was prevailing party when court entered take-nothing\n\n                                        42\n\fjudgment in his favor); see also Epps v. Fowler, 351 S.W.3d 862, 868–69 (Tex.\n\n2011) (holding that defendant is prevailing party for purposes of award of\n\nattorney’s fees when plaintiff nonsuits case with prejudice).        Because the\n\nsummary-judgment evidence does not conclusively prove Almeda’s entitlement to\n\n$8,000 in attorney’s fees for defending against appellants’ claims, we sustain the\n\nappellants’ eighth issue in part, and we remand this issue to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the judgment of the trial court to the extent it awarded Almeda\n\n$8,000 in attorney’s fees for defending against the appellants’ claims, and we\n\nremand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion. The judgment of the trial court is otherwise affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Michael Massengale\n                                             Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Jennings, Bland, and Massengale.\n\n\n\n\n                                        43\n\f",

The apartment complex is owned by Almeda, and it is\n\nlocated near the medical center in Houston, Texas. The Richardsons met the\n\napartment manager, Susan Franz. During this conversation, they told her that their\n\noccupations—emergency helicopter pilot and emergency room nurse—required\n\nthat they work irregular hours. They therefore required an apartment that would be\n\nquiet enough to allow them to sleep night or day, and they asked if the apartments\n\nwere noisy. Michelle said that Franz “reassured me countless times that it was a\n\nquiet place.” Michelle never put her concerns about noise in writing; Franz never\n\nput her representations that the apartment was quiet in writing, either. According\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fto the Richardsons, Franz recommended apartment 175, a ground-floor apartment\n\nnear a meditation fountain, which she told them would be a quiet area.\n\n      Michelle also had concerns about the security of the apartment complex, and\n\nshe conceded that she knew it was not a crime-free area before she signed the\n\nlease. However, she said that Franz assured her about the safety of the apartment\n\ncomplex saying that “there wasn’t crime,” that “it was a secure property,” and\n\nbecause “it was a gated community . . . the only people that could come in and out\n\nwere with the remote gates . . . .”\n\n      The Richardsons also told Franz that Michelle’s father, Richard Day, would\n\nbe living with them, and that he was a disabled Vietnam veteran. They requested a\n\nground-floor apartment, telling Franz that Day’s back and knee problems required\n\nsuch access as well as an accessible parking spot. Although Day testified that he\n\nhad no input into the choice of the apartment, he testified that the apartment\n\nmanager represented that the apartment was “very quiet, very peaceful” and\n\nsuitable for his needs. Day also told Franz that he would need an accessible\n\nparking spot, and he testified that he had no complaints about the availability of\n\nsuitable parking. Nobody informed Franz or any other representative of Almeda\n\nthat Day suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. None of the appellants ever\n\nmade a written request for accommodations for Day’s disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      The Richardsons and Day all signed the lease agreement. The term of the\n\nlease was from February 9, 2009 to March 29, 2010, and thereafter it would\n\nautomatically continue month-to-month unless either party gave written notice 60\n\ndays before termination. The lease included several provisions that would entitle a\n\ntenant to terminate without penalty, including (1) delay of occupancy caused by\n\nconstruction, repairs, cleaning or a prior resident’s holding over, (2) provisions\n\napplicable to military personnel, (3) breach of certain responsibilities owed by\n\nAlmeda and in accordance with Section 92.056 of the Texas Property Code, and\n\n(4) moving out after giving proper notice at the expiration of a lease term.\n\nHowever, the lease also provided that if those termination provisions did not apply,\n\n“you won’t be released from this Lease Contract for any reason . . . . You will still\n\nbe liable for the entire Lease Contract term if you move out early.”\n\n      Under the lease, failure to pay rent, violation of the lease or any apartment\n\nrules, and abandonment of the apartment are among the actions that would\n\nconstitute default by the resident. The lease provided that “[a]ll monthly rent for\n\nthe rest of the Lease Contract term” would be “accelerated automatically” and\n\nimmediately due if the tenant moved out without consent and without paying all\n\nrent for the entire lease term. The lease specifically stated that Almeda “may\n\nreport unpaid amounts to credit agencies,” and it reserved the right to exercise “all\n\nother legal remedies” in the event of a tenant’s default.\n\n                                          4\n\f      The lease included several other provisions that are relevant to the parties’\n\neventual dispute.   With respect to the tenants’ conduct while living in the\n\napartment, it provided:\n\n      18. COMMUNITY POLICIES OR RULES. You and all guests\n      and occupants must comply with any written apartment rules and\n      community policies, including instructions for care of our property.\n      Our rules are considered part of this Lease Contract. . . .\n\n      19. LIMITATIONS ON CONDUCT. . . . We may exclude from the\n      apartment community guests or others who, in our judgment, have\n      been violating the law, violating this Lease Contract or any apartment\n      rules, or disturbing other residents, neighbors, visitors, or owner\n      representatives. . . .\n\n      20. PROHIBITED CONDUCT. You and your occupants or guests\n      may not engage in the following activities: criminal conduct;\n      behaving in a loud or obnoxious manner; disturbing or threatening the\n      rights, comfort, health, safety, or convenience of others (including our\n      agents and employees) in or near the apartment community . . . .\n\nTwo separate sections of the lease included provisions addressing safety and\n\nsecurity. The following provisions appeared in the section of the lease entitled\n\n“While You’re Living in the Apartment”:\n\n      24. RESIDENT SAFETY AND LOSS. You and all occupants and\n      guests must exercise due care for your own and others’ safety and\n      security, especially in the use of smoke alarms and other detection\n      devices, door and window locks, and other safety or security\n      devices. . . .\n      ....\n\n      Loss. We’re not liable to any resident, guest, or occupant for personal\n      injury or damage, loss of personal property, or business or personal\n      income from any cause, including, but not limited to . . . theft,\n\n                                         5\n\f      negligent or intentional acts of residents, occupants or guests, or\n      vandalism unless otherwise required by law. . . .\n\n      ....\n\n      Crime or Emergency. Dial 911 or immediately call local medical\n      emergency, fire, or police personnel in case of accident, fire, smoke,\n      suspected criminal activity, or other emergency involving imminent\n      harm. You should then contact our representative. You won’t treat\n      any of our security measures as an express or implied warranty of\n      security, or as a guarantee against crime or of reduced risk of crime.\n      Unless otherwise provided by law, we’re not liable to you or any\n      guests or occupants for injury, damage, or loss to person or property\n      caused by criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary,\n      assault, vandalism, or other crimes. . . .\n\nThe section of the lease entitled “Security Guidelines for Residents” included the\n\nfollowing provision:\n\n      36. SECURITY GUIDELINES. We care about your safety and that\n      of other occupants and guests. No security system is failsafe. Even\n      the best system can’t prevent crime. Always act as if security systems\n      don’t exist since they are subject to malfunction, tampering, and\n      human error. We disclaim any express or implied warranties of\n      security. The best safety measures are the ones you perform as a\n      matter of common sense and habit.\n\n(Emphasis in original.) Paragraph 36 also urged adherence to 20 specific crime-\n\nprevention tips listed in the lease agreement.\n\n      In addition, the lease included a merger clause, disclaiming any oral\n\npromises or representations by the apartment’s representatives:\n\n      33. MISCELLANEOUS. Neither we nor any of our representatives\n      have made any oral promises, representations, or agreements. This\n      Lease Contract is the entire agreement between you and us. Our\n      representatives (including management personnel, employees, and\n                                          6\n\f      agents) have no authority to waive, amend, or terminate this Lease\n      Contract or any part of it, unless in writing, and no authority to make\n      promises, representations, or agreements that impose security duties\n      or other obligations on us or our representatives unless in writing. . . .\n      Written notice to or from our managers constitutes notice to or from\n      us. Any person giving a notice under this Lease Contract should\n      retain a copy of the memo, letter, or fax that was given, as well as any\n      fax transmittal verification. Fax or electronic signatures are binding.\n      All notices must be signed. Notices may not be given by email or\n      other electronic transmission.\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\n\n      Initially, Michelle loved the apartment. She said:\n\n      When we moved in, when we first went—I’m not gonna lie, I fell in\n      love with the apartments. They are beautiful. I was very happy to\n      move there, very happy with everything about the apartments. . . .\n      [W]hen we first moved in, it was quiet, before the neighbors moved\n      in. It was nice, wonderful.\n\nBut then, noisy neighbors moved into apartment 174, which was next door to the\n\nappellants’ apartment. According to the Richardsons, the residents of apartment\n\n174 played loud music and hosted parties until the early morning hours. Michelle\n\nalso complained about the noise of sexual activity occurring in the neighboring\n\napartment, which she described as “constant.”\n\n      Neither of the Richardsons ever spoke to the neighbors about the noise or\n\nleft any notes. They did not know if other residents complained of the noise in\n\ntheir vicinity. Day said he spoke to the neighbor about the noise once in passing,\n\nand his neighbor agreed to keep the volume of music lower. But, according to\n\nDay, the neighbor failed to do so.\n                                          7\n\f      The Richardsons contacted apartment management numerous times\n\nregarding their noisy neighbors. They made telephone calls and twice sent letters\n\nwith their rent checks reiterating that they needed a quiet place to sleep because\n\ntheir jobs required them to be alert. They requested help in resolving the issue.\n\nFranz initially asked them not to call the police and to allow management to\n\naddress the noise problem. However, they nevertheless called the police several\n\ntimes about the noisy neighbors. Steven testified in his deposition that he got high\n\nblood pressure as a result of noise in the apartment.\n\n      In addition to the noise, the appellants were also troubled by security issues.\n\nSteven’s motorcycle was stolen from the apartment complex, and the appellants\n\nsometimes noticed people they described as vagrants sleeping in the hallway.\n\n      To address the appellants’ complaints about the noise, Almeda offered them\n\na different apartment, which was on a higher floor and farther from the elevators.\n\nNone of the appellants informed any Almeda representative that Day’s disability\n\nmade this offer unacceptable, nor did they request any other accommodation.\n\nRather, the Richardsons were concerned about the expense of moving to another\n\napartment, which Almeda did not offer to reimburse. Day testified that he felt that\n\nAlmeda was discriminating against him by suggesting that the appellants move to\n\nanother apartment instead of requiring that the neighbors move. Day said, “[H]e\n\nwas the problem, why not ask him to move . . . .”\n\n                                          8\n\f      In September 2009, the appellants vacated their apartment. They did not\n\nprovide written notice in accordance with the lease provisions, but they paid rent in\n\na prorated amount to cover the days they occupied the apartment during that\n\nmonth.\n\n      Almeda secured a new tenant for apartment 175 and sought to collect\n\naccelerated rent and reimbursement for rental concessions that it believed the\n\nappellants owed under the terms of the lease, less the amount it received from the\n\nnew tenant in mitigation of its damages. Almeda engaged National Credit Audit\n\nCorporation (NCAC) to collect the debt. Michelle testified that she sent NCAC a\n\nletter disputing the debt. In the letter, Michelle stated, “I am a disabled person,”\n\nand she argued that Almeda had violated the Fair Housing Act by “tell[ing] us we\n\nhad to move to the third floor.”      Approximately a month later, NCAC sent\n\nMichelle a second letter stating that because she had not responded, “we are now\n\nlegally entitled to assume that you acknowledge the debt but are refusing to pay\n\nvoluntarily.”\n\n      Approximately seven months later, the Richardsons and Day sued NCAC\n\nand Almeda.     They alleged the following causes of action against Almeda:\n\n(1) violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act by (i) engaging in an\n\nunconscionable action or course of action, (ii) making misrepresentations or failing\n\nto disclose information in violation of Section 17.46(b) of the Texas Business &\n\n                                         9\n\fCommerce Code, and (iii) violating the Texas Debt Collection Act; (2) breach of\n\ncontract; (3) constructive eviction; (4) violation of the Texas Fair Housing Act; and\n\n(5) violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act.\n\n      They also alleged that NCAC violated the Texas Debt Collection Practices\n\nAct and the National Fair Debt Collection Practices Act while acting on behalf of\n\nAlmeda. While the appellants later settled with NCAC, they alleged that Almeda\n\nwas liable for NCAC’s actions under an agency theory.           They sought actual\n\ndamages (including out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use, loss of benefit of the\n\nbargain, and costs of medical and psychiatric care), mental anguish damages,\n\nexemplary damages, and attorney’s fees. Almeda counterclaimed to recover the\n\nunpaid accelerated rent, reimbursement for rental concessions, and attorney’s fees.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment on its counterclaim and on each of\n\nthe appellants’ causes of action, challenging one or more elements of each cause of\n\naction on traditional or no-evidence grounds. The trial court granted Almeda’s\n\ntraditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment without specifying the\n\ngrounds upon which it based its ruling. The court awarded Almeda damages as\n\nwell as $8,000 in attorney’s fees incurred in defending the appellants’ claims and\n\n$4,000 in attorney’s fees for prosecuting its breach-of-contract counterclaim. It\n\nalso awarded contingent appellate attorney’s fees in a maximum aggregate amount\n\nof $40,000. Finally, the court dismissed with prejudice each of the appellants’\n\n                                         10\n\fcauses of action against Almeda including the causes of action for violation of the\n\nTexas Debt Collection Act and the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\nThe Richardsons and Day appealed.\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      We review de novo the trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary\n\njudgment.

Fair Housing Act claims\n\n      In their fourth issue, the appellants allege that the trial court erred by\n\ngranting summary judgment on Day’s claims for violation of the Federal and\n\nTexas Fair Housing Acts. In the first amended petition, Day alleged that Almeda\n\nviolated both fair housing acts by failing to make reasonable accommodations\n\nregarding rules, policies, practices, or services when such accommodation was\n\nnecessary to afford him an equal opportunity to enjoy the premises.\n\n      Under the Federal Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful to discriminate against a\n\nperson “in the terms, conditions, or privileges of . . . rental of a dwelling . . .\n\nbecause of a handicap of . . . that person or . . . a person residing . . . in the\n\ndwelling after it is . . . rented . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2). “[D]iscrimination\n\nincludes . . . a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies,\n\n                                        12\n\fpractices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such\n\nperson equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” Id. § 3604(f)(3)(B). One\n\npurpose of the Texas Fair Housing Act is to “provide rights and remedies\n\nsubstantially equivalent to those granted under federal law.” TEX. PROP. CODE\n\nANN. § 301.002 (West 2013). Under the Texas Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful for\n\na person to discriminate against another “in the terms, conditions, or privileges of .\n\n. . rental of a dwelling . . . because of a disability of . . . the other person [or] a\n\nperson residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is . . . rented . . . .”\n\nTEX.

Implicit in the\n\nconcept of “refusal” is the notion that the plaintiff must make a request for an\n\naccommodation. Cf. Groome Res. Ltd., L.L.C. v.

Cf. Groome Res.,\n\n234 F.3d at 198; Taylor, 93 F.3d at 165.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment on the ground that there is no\n\nevidence that it failed to make a reasonable accommodation that was necessary to\n\nafford Day an equal opportunity to enjoy the premises. In response, Day argued\n\nthat the apartment complex knew that he was disabled due to his arthritic knees,\n\nthat he requested an accommodation in the form of an accessible parking spot, and\n\nthat he was deprived of the use of his apartment and the serenity pool area because\n\nof noise. On appeal Day argues that there is a material issue of fact as to whether\n\nAlmeda’s failure to make and enforce rules for use of the serenity pool area and its\n\n“moving [Day] to a much further walk on his arthritic knees” constituted a failure\n\nto make a reasonable accommodation in violation of the state and federal fair\n\nhousing acts.\n\n      As summary-judgment proof, Day provided his affidavit and those of the\n\nRichardsons, which stated that prior to signing the lease, they informed Franz that:\n\n(1) Day is a disabled veteran, (2) he has arthritic knees, (3) he could not walk far\n\nfrom his car to the door, (4) he would require an accessible parking space, (5) he\n\nneeded a ground-floor apartment, and (6) due to his disability, he required quiet.\n\n                                           14\n\fSteven’s deposition testimony also showed that he had informed Franz and another\n\nrepresentative of the apartment complex that Day had a bad back. Steven said they\n\nchose a ground-floor apartment because it would be easier for Day to get around.\n\n      However, in Michelle’s deposition, she specifically testified that she did not\n\ninform the apartment representatives that her father suffered from PTSD. Neither\n\nDay’s deposition excerpt nor Almeda’s interrogatory answers provide any\n\nadditional information about Day’s disability or his fair housing claims. There is\n\nno evidence pertaining to making or enforcing rules for use of the serenity pool,\n\nnor is there evidence that Almeda moved Day to a “much further walk on his\n\narthritic knees.”\n\n      The evidence shows that in response to the appellants’ initial request for a\n\nground-floor apartment, they were given a ground-floor apartment. It also shows\n\nthat Day had an opportunity to use the accessible parking spots and that neither\n\nDay nor the Richardsons ever made any other request for an accommodation for\n\nDay. Rather, in response to Almeda’s offer to allow the appellants to move to\n\nanother apartment, the appellants abandoned the lease without requesting an\n\naccommodation.\n\n      Almeda’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment attacked the element\n\nof failure to make a reasonable accommodation. In light of the conclusive proof\n\nthat there was no request for an accommodation and the complete absence of\n\n                                        15\n\fevidence that the apartment complex refused to make a requested reasonable\n\naccommodation, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary\n\njudgment on Day’s state and federal fair housing causes of action. Cf. Groome\n\nRes., 234 F.3d at 198; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Taylor, 93 F.3d at 165.\n\n      II.    Constructive eviction\n\n      In their fifth issue, the appellants allege that the trial court erred by granting\n\nsummary judgment on their constructive eviction claim. In their first amended\n\npetition, the appellants alleged that their lease included an implied covenant of\n\nquiet enjoyment, which Almeda breached. The petition does not allege any facts\n\nshowing how Almeda constructively evicted the appellants.             “A constructive\n\neviction occurs when the tenant leaves the leased premises due to conduct by the\n\nlandlord which materially interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the\n\npremises.” Fidelity Mut.

The court explained that there must be evidence of “some additional\n\nfeature, such as harassing incidents disturbing to the tenant’s peaceful possession\n\nand occurring on the property.” Id.\n\n      Among other grounds, Almeda moved for summary judgment on this cause\n\nof action because there was no evidence of intent. In response, the appellants\n\nsubmitted their own affidavits and Steven’s deposition testimony. The affidavits\n\nshow that all three appellants were troubled by the noise and that complaints to the\n\napartment complex sometimes resulted in a temporary cessation of noise but\n\nsometimes brought no relief. In addition, the affidavits and deposition testimony\n\nshowed that rather than requiring the neighbors to be quiet, the apartment complex\n\noffered the appellants an opportunity to move to another apartment at their own\n\nexpense. The evidence does not show that the apartment complex in any way\n\nrequired the appellants to move or otherwise disturbed their possession of the\n\napartment. That Almeda offered the appellants an alternative apartment is not\n\n                                        18\n\fevidence that they were being deprived of their leased apartment or that Almeda\n\nintended to evict them. We overrule this issue.\n\n      III.   Texas Debt Collection Practices Act\n\n      In their sixth issue, the appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting\n\nsummary judgment on their claims for violation of the Texas Debt Collection\n\nPractices Act. See TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. §§ 392.001–.404 (West 2006). In their\n\nfirst amended petition, they alleged that NCAC, acting as an agent for Almeda,\n\nviolated the TDCPA by: (1) misrepresenting or threatening to misrepresent to\n\nanother person that they willfully refused to pay a nondisputed consumer debt\n\nwhen the debt was in dispute and the NCAC had been notified in writing of the\n\ndispute, see id. § 392.301(a)(3); (2) threatening to take actions prohibited by law,\n\nsee id. § 392.301(a)(8); and (3) misrepresenting the character, extent, or amount of\n\na consumer debt, see id. § 392.304(a)(8). They also alleged that they suffered\n\nactual damages and mental anguish, but the pleading did not provide any specific\n\nfacts pertaining to these elements of damages.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment asserting, among other grounds, that\n\nthere was no evidence that the appellants suffered any injury as a result of the\n\nalleged violations of the TDCPA. In response to Almeda’s traditional motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the appellants attached an unsworn amended response to a\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\frequest for disclosure which included the following factual statements pertaining to\n\ndamages:\n\n            Plaintiffs Steven and Michelle Richardson incurred moving\n      expenses of $10,000.00. From September 7, 2009 through March 1,\n      2010 (the latter date being the day the lease ended) Plaintiff Steven\n      Richardson incurred commute expenses of $2,000.00. Plaintiff\n      Michelle Richardson incurred additional commute expenses of\n      $1,500.00. Plaintiff Steven Richardson’s motorcycle at the time of its\n      theft had a fair market value of $8,500.00. Plaintiff Steven\n      Richardson has incurred medical expenses in excess of $1,000.00.\n      The apartment we paid for cost $1777.00 per month and was\n      worthless. We paid rent, including the prorated portion of the month\n      we moved out, in the amount of $10,789.00. Plaintiff Michelle\n      Richardson and Plaintiff Steven Richardson suffered overlapping\n      economic damages in the amount [of] $33,786.00.\n\n            Plaintiff Richard Day suffered $2,000.00 in damages for\n      increased commuter costs.\n\n      In response to Almeda’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment as to\n\ntheir TDCPA claim, the appellants did not respond to the contention that there was\n\nno evidence of damages.       Even considering the appellants’ response to the\n\ntraditional motion for summary judgment on the element of TDCPA damages, we\n\nconclude that there is no evidence of damages from a violation of the TDCPA\n\nbecause the appellants’ unsworn discovery disclosure includes no factual allegation\n\nof any harm resulting from the alleged TDCPA violation, and in any case it is not\n\ncompetent summary-judgment evidence.

We hold that the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment as to the appellants’ TDCPA claim. We overrule this issue.\n\n      IV.    Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n\n      In their seventh issue, the appellants argue that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment on their claims for violation of the Federal Fair Debt\n\nCollection Practices Act. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692–1692p. In their first amended\n\npetition, the appellants alleged that NCAC, while acting on behalf of Almeda:\n\n(1) violated 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(a)(2) by “misrepresenting the character or amount\n\nof a consumer debt” because they owed nothing or were excused from performing\n\nunder the lease by Almeda’s prior breach; (2) violated 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e)(a)(5)\n\nby “threatening to take action that cannot be legally taken or that was not intended\n\nto be taken” by threatening to report the debt as undisputed when they previously\n\ninformed NCAC in writing that they disputed the debt; and (3) violated 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1692e(a)(8) by “threatening to communicate false credit information, including\n\nthat the failure to communicate that a disputed debt is disputed,” specifically by\n\nstating in the February 17, 2010 collection letter that it intended to report the debt\n\nas undisputed to credit agencies. The appellants further alleged that they suffered\n\nactual damages including mental anguish as a result of the violations of the Federal\n\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f       The February 17, 2010 letter that forms the basis of the appellants’ debt\n\ncollection claims was addressed only to Michelle. In the subject line it identified\n\n“Equinox Apt 175,” showed a file number, and stated a balance of $3,257.30. The\n\nletter stated:\n\n             We have corresponded with you previously, concerning the\n       above referenced account.\n\n            Unfortunately, you have failed to respond in a timely manner.\n       As a consequence, we are now legally entitled to assume that you\n       acknowledge the debt but are refusing to pay voluntarily.\n\n              My client expects me to pursue all available legal remedies to\n       effect collection of your account. I urge you to make additional\n       collection efforts unnecessary by remitting the balance or contacting\n       me immediately to discuss payment options. . . . For your\n       convenience, we can accept at no additional cost, checks by phone,\n       Western Union Quick Collect, credit and debit cards.\n\n             Further procrastination on your part will only result in greater\n       expense as well as other undesirable consequences. Act now to\n       protect your credit. I will allow 7 days for your response.\n\nThe bottom of the letter read, “This is an attempt to collect a debt.           Any\n\ninformation obtained will be used for that purpose.”\n\n       Almeda moved for traditional summary judgment on the grounds that it is\n\nnot a debt collector and the appellants were not injured. Almeda also argued that\n\neven if it were a debt collector, there still was no evidence that it used a false,\n\ndeceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\fof a debt against the appellants, or that the appellants were injured as a result of the\n\nalleged conduct.\n\n      The Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits a debt collector\n\nfrom using “any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in\n\nconnection with the collection of any debt.” 15 U.S.C. § 1692e. A prevailing\n\nplaintiff may recover actual damages, additional damages up to $1,000, costs, and\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees for prosecuting the civil action.

Thus “evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of the\n\nmental anguish is required.” Id. To overcome Almeda’s no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the appellants must have produced some evidence that, as a\n\n                                          23\n\fresult of the allegedly improper debt collection activities, they each suffered “a\n\nhigh degree of mental pain and distress” that is “more than mere worry, anxiety,\n\nvexation, embarrassment, or anger,” or that substantially disrupted their routines.\n\nSee Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2454480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2454480/parkway-co-v-woodruff/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (Tex. 1995).\n\n       First, the record shows that the allegedly improper debt collection letter was\n\naddressed and sent only to Michelle, not to Steven or her father. However, the\n\nappellants all produced affidavits to support their allegations that they were injured\n\nas a result of the alleged violations of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices\n\nAct.\n\n       Steven’s affidavit in relevant part primarily addressed injuries resulting from\n\nthe noise he encountered at the apartment complex and his subsequent move. That\n\nportion of the affidavit did not show that any of his claimed economic damages\n\nresulted from the debt collection actions, about which he said:\n\n       13. As a result of National Credit Audit Corporation trying to\n       collect an invalid debt from me, threatening to take legal action they\n       could not take, and threatening to report the debt as undisputed,\n       caused me to suffer even more indignation and embarrassment\n       causing further disruption of my daily routine. I was caused to feel\n       constantly indignant, tense, disgusted, physically ill, and upset.\n\nHowever, these statements are conclusory because they lack factual support as to\n\nthe nature, duration, or extent of the stated emotional distress or how his daily\n\nroutine was disrupted. Therefore, these statements are insufficient to overcome a\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fno-evidence challenge to the element of injury as to Steven. See Serv. Corp. Int’l,\n\n348 S.W.3d at 231; Parkway Co., 901 S.W.2d at 444.\n\n      Likewise, Michelle’s affidavit described the bothersome noise and its\n\nimpacts on her family, as well as the costs associated with vacating the apartment.\n\nShe specifically addressed the debt collection activities, saying:\n\n              As a result of [NCAC] trying to collect an invalid debt from us,\n      threatening to take legal action they could not take, and threatening to\n      report the debt as undisputed, caused me to suffer even more\n      indignation and embarrassment causing further disruption of my daily\n      routine. I was caused to feel constantly indignant, tense, disgusted,\n      physically ill, and upset. The debt was invalid because they breached\n      the contract first and also forced us to move out. They threatened to\n      represent that the debt was undisputed because . . . the letter states that\n      we failed to ‘timely respond’ and they could ‘assume’ our\n      acknowledgement of the debt but are refusing to pay voluntarily.\n      They therefore, also threatened to take action they legally could not\n      take. They also threatened to report it to a credit bureau. This letter,\n      just like their previous letter, misrepresented the extent or nature of a\n      debt, because of [Almeda’s] conduct, we did not owe them anything.\n\n      The exact same paragraph appears in Day’s affidavit, and it, too, is his only\n\nevidence of injury sustained as a result of the debt collection practices. As with\n\nSteven’s affidavit, these statements are conclusory because they lack factual\n\nsupport as to the nature, duration, or extent of the alleged emotional distress or\n\nhow their daily routines were disrupted.           Therefore, these statements are\n\ninsufficient to overcome a no-evidence challenge to the element of injury as to\n\nMichelle and Day. See Serv. Corp. Int’l, 348 S.W.3d at 231; Parkway Co., 901\n\nS.W.2d at 444.\n                                          25\n\f      Because there is no evidence upon which a reasonable fact finder could find\n\nthat any of the appellants suffered damages as a result of the allegedly improper\n\ndebt collection practices, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment as to the FDCPA claim. We overrule this issue.\n\n      V.     Breach of contract\n\n      In their second and third issues, the appellants challenge the trial court’s\n\nsummary-judgment rulings on their cause of action for breach of contract and on\n\nAlmeda’s counterclaim for breach of contract.\n\n             A. The appellants’ contract claim\n\n      In their first amended petition, the appellants alleged that Almeda breached\n\nthe lease agreement based upon the following events: (1) Almeda represented that\n\nthe apartment would be suitable for the appellants and that there had been no\n\nreports of theft; (2) the appellants were disturbed by noise from the neighboring\n\napartment during late hours of the night and early hours of the morning; (3)\n\nAlmeda proposed that the appellants move to a different apartment on a higher\n\nfloor of the apartment building; (4) Steven’s motorcycle was stolen from the\n\napartment complex; and (5) the noise, theft of personal property, and\n\n“discrimination on the basis of disability” constituted constructive eviction.\n\n      Almeda inquired about the breach-of-contract allegations during each\n\nappellant’s deposition. Michelle testified that Almeda breached the part of the\n\n                                         26\n\fcontract that required them to “provide a quiet environment, safe environment.”\n\nSteven testified that he believed Almeda breached its contract by failing to resolve\n\ntheir noise complaints. He said he did not know which provision of the contract\n\nwas breached in this way, but he said, “There’s a clause in there that talks about\n\nthe right to peace and quiet and things like that. . . . [T]here’s something in there\n\nthat references the fact that if there’s a problem, this is the way you should notify\n\nthe management company and do it in writing, and we did that. And, also, we\n\nmade the verbal requests and things of such, and there was no resolve ever\n\noffered.” Day testified that he believed Almeda breached the lease by suggesting\n\nthat the appellants move instead of suggesting that the noisy neighbors move and\n\nby failing to give them a quiet place.\n\n      Almeda moved for summary judgment on grounds that (1) the appellants did\n\nnot perform or tender performance under the lease and were not excused from\n\nperformance, (2) none of the allegations against Almeda constitute a breach of the\n\nlease, and (3) there is no evidence that (i) the appellants performed, tendered\n\nperformance, or were excused from performing their obligations under the lease,\n\n(ii) Almeda breached the lease, or (iii) the appellants were injured by any alleged\n\nbreach of the lease by Almeda. In response to the motion, the appellants argued,\n\namong other things, that they performed under the lease until they were\n\nconstructively evicted and that the constructive eviction excused further\n\n                                         27\n\fperformance under the lease. They also argued that Almeda breached the contract\n\nby breaching the implied covenant of quiet use and enjoyment and by failing to\n\ncomply with fair housing laws.\n\n      The essential elements of a breach-of-contract claim are: (1) the existence of\n\na valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff;\n\n(3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages sustained by the\n\nplaintiff as a result of the breach.

We have already held that the trial court\n\ndid not err by granting summary judgment on the appellants’ cause of action for\n\nconstructive eviction. “In the absence of constructive eviction, there can be no\n\nbreach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.” Id. at 541. Therefore, we hold that\n\nthe appellants’ summary-judgment evidence does not create a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to Almeda’s alleged breach of the implied covenant of quiet use\n\nand enjoyment. See id.\n\n      The appellants correctly state that the lease required Almeda to\n\n“substantially comply with all applicable laws regarding . . . fair housing.”\n\n                                        28\n\fHowever, we have already held that the trial court did not err by granting summary\n\njudgment as to the appellants’ fair housing causes of action because there is no\n\nevidence that Almeda refused to make a requested accommodation. We likewise\n\nconclude that there is no evidence that Almeda breached the lease by failing to\n\nsubstantially comply with all applicable laws regarding fair housing.\n\n      Finally, the evidence is undisputed that the appellants did not provide\n\nwritten notice of their intention to vacate the apartment 60 days in advance and that\n\nthey did not pay the full amount of rent due through the end of the lease term.\n\nBecause the appellants did not fully perform under the contract and because their\n\nnon-performance was not excused by constructive eviction, we conclude that there\n\nis no genuine issue of material fact as to that element of the appellants’ breach-of-\n\ncontract claim.\n\n      We hold that the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment on the\n\nappellants’ breach-of-contract cause of action, and we overrule this issue.\n\n             B. Almeda’s contract counterclaim\n\n      In its first amended counterclaim, Almeda alleged that the appellants\n\nbreached the lease by vacating the premises before the expiration of the lease term\n\nwithout giving 60 days’ notice and without paying the accelerated rent and other\n\namounts that were due under the lease. Almeda moved for traditional summary\n\njudgment on its counterclaim, attaching as evidence the appellants’ original\n\n                                         29\n\fpetition, the lease agreement, an affidavit from Susan Franz, a copy of a resident\n\nledger showing amounts paid on the appellants’ account, and transcripts from the\n\nappellents’ depositions. In response, the appellants argued that their breach of the\n\nlease was excused by Almeda’s breach of its implied covenant of quiet use and\n\nenjoyment. The appellants proffered evidence to support their contentions that\n\ntheir neighbors were noisy, that the noise was troublesome to them and caused\n\nthem stress, that they complained to apartment management about the noise, and\n\nthat management offered them an alternative apartment on a higher floor. They\n\nfurther argued that there was no evidence that Almeda “attempted to move, evict,\n\nor otherwise remedy the noise violations vis a vis the noisy neighbors in the\n\nadjacent apartment.” The appellants also argued about the rental concessions,\n\nstating that Almeda’s motion for summary judgment failed to “state how paragraph\n\n32 of the parties’ lease agreement justifies the concession charges charged by\n\n[Almeda] and therefore fails to provide adequate notice on what basis summary\n\njudgment is sought.” The appellants did not provide any evidence pertinent to the\n\nissue of concession fees.\n\n      We have already held that there is no genuine issue of material fact on the\n\nappellants’ cause of action for breach of contract based on a breach of the implied\n\ncovenant of quiet use and enjoyment. See Holmes, 856 S.W.2d at 541. The\n\nappellants brought forth no evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\n                                         30\n\fthe justification for the rental concession charges. Thus, the trial court’s summary\n\njudgment as to Almeda’s breach-of-contract counterclaim is proper if Almeda’s\n\nsummary-judgment evidence shows that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see also Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 128\n\nS.W.3d at 215–16.\n\n      It is undisputed that the appellants signed the lease agreement. It is also\n\nundisputed that the lease expired March 29, 2010, and that the appellants vacated\n\nthe apartment in September 2009 without providing 60 days’ written notice and\n\nwithout Almeda’s consent. There is neither evidence nor argument that any of the\n\nother contractual justifications for termination of the lease apply in this case, other\n\nthan those that we have already held to be unavailing. Franz’s affidavit shows that\n\nthe appellants owed $3,955.11 for accelerated rent and reimbursement of rental\n\nconcessions based on (i) the date of their departure, (ii) their monthly rent, (iii) the\n\ndate when a new tenant moved into the vacated apartment, mitigating Almeda’s\n\ndamages, and (iv) credits for prorated September 2009 rent paid by the appellants\n\nand other deposits. The trial court rendered summary judgment in Almeda’s favor\n\nfor the amount of $3,955.11. We hold that it did not err in doing so, and we\n\noverrule this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f   VI.   DTPA claims\n\n      In their first issue, the appellants challenge the trial court’s summary-\n\njudgment ruling on their causes of action for violation of the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practices Act. In their first amended petition, the appellants alleged that\n\nAlmeda violated the DTPA by (1) engaging in an unconscionable action or course\n\nof action, TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. §§ 17.45(5) & 17.50(a)(3) (West 2011);\n\n(2) engaging in false, misleading, or decetive acts or practices in the conduct of\n\ntrade or commerce by (i) representing that goods or services have sponsorship,\n\napproval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities which they do\n\nnot have, id. § 17.46(b)(5), (ii) representing that an agreement concerning goods or\n\nservices confers or involves rights, remedies, or obligations which it does not have\n\nor involve, id. § 17.46(b)(12), and (iii) failing to disclose information concerning\n\ngoods or services which was known at the time of the transaction with the intention\n\nto induce the consumer into a transaction into which the consumer would not have\n\nentered had the information been disclosed id. § 17.46(b)(24); and (3) by engaging\n\nin false, misleading, or deceptive acts prohibited by the Texas Debt Collection Act,\n\nsee TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. § 392.404(a). The appellants did not specify which\n\nstatements or actions formed the basis for each alleged misrepresentation or\n\nunconscionable act, and Almeda did not specially except to the pleading.\n\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\f      Almeda moved for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) as a matter of\n\nlaw, a merger clause in the lease agreement negated any assertion of\n\nmisrepresentation, and (2) the lease agreement expressly disclaimed the existence\n\nof express or implied warranties. Almeda also moved on the grounds that there\n\nwas no evidence that it: (3) engaged in a false, misleading, or deceptive act or\n\npractice that is specifically enumerated in section 17.46(b) of the DTPA;\n\n(4) breached an express or implied warranty; (5) engaged in an unconscionable\n\naction or course of action; or (6) engaged in any action that was a producing cause\n\nof any damages suffered by the Richardsons or Day.\n\n      In   response,   the   appellants   alleged   that   the   following   Almeda\n\nmisrepresentations are actionable as violations of section 17.46(b)(5): (1) that “the\n\napartment they were renting provided the safe, quiet environment they specifically\n\nrequired”; (2) that “the apartment was free from extraneous noise to the extent that\n\nPlaintiffs would obtain sufficient rest to perform their occupations”; and (3) that “a\n\nlocation near the serenity pool would provide even greater degree of quiet.” The\n\nappellants further argued that the following Almeda misrepresentations are\n\nactionable as violations of section 17.46(b)(12): (1) that Almeda told the appellants\n\nthey could do nothing about noise violations and (2) that “if Plaintiffs wanted quiet\n\nenjoyment of their lease they had to move to another floor at their expense for even\n\nhigher rent.” But as to alleged violations of section 17.46(b)(24), the appellants\n\n                                          33\n\fdid not identify any specific statements or actions as violating this provision. The\n\nappellants argued that Almeda further engaged in the following unconscionable\n\nactions or course of actions: (1) representing at the time of the transaction that the\n\napartment would be quiet enough for them to obtain rest needed to perform their\n\noccupations; (2) representing that the area near the serenity pool would “enhance\n\nthe placidity” and “provide suitable lack of noise”; (3) representing that there was a\n\nlack of criminal activity on the premises; (4) refusing to properly address noise\n\ncomplaints; (5) failing to conduct an adequate investigation; (6) refusing to enforce\n\nrules or policies contained in the lease; and (7) misrepresenting to the appellants\n\nthat their sole remedy was to move to another apartment on another floor at greater\n\nexpense and at the appellants’ inconvenience.\n\n      “The DTPA grants consumers a cause of action for false, misleading, or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices.” Amstadt v.

See TEX. BUS. & COM.

Generally, an act is false, misleading,\n\nor deceptive if it has the capacity to deceive an “ignorant, unthinking, or credulous\n\nperson.” Doe v.

Absent\n\nevidence that the defendant’s statement was false, a DTPA action for\n\nmisrepresentation cannot survive summary judgment.

The DTPA’s\n\npurpose in making misrepresentations actionable is “to ensure that descriptions of\n\ngoods or services offered for sale are accurate.” Id.; Pennington, 606 S.W.2d at\n\n687. While the appellants correctly note that there is no requirement that Almeda\n\nor its representative have knowledge of the falsity of the statement to be actionable\n\n                                         35\n\funder the DTPA, the statement still must be shown to have been false. See Doe,\n\n907 S.W.2d at 479–80. The appellants’ summary-judgment evidence shows only\n\nthat, more than a month after they moved in, the apartment was not quiet or free\n\nfrom crime. There was no evidence that the apartment was noisy or that the\n\napartment complex was unsafe or not secure when Franz allegedly made the\n\nrepresentations about noise and security. Because there was no evidence that\n\nFranz’s alleged statements were false, the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment on this basis. Id.\n\n      Third, as to the appellants’ allegations that Almeda violated the DTPA by\n\nengaging in an unconscionable action or course of action by not investigating their\n\ncomplaints, not enforcing community rules, and offering them an alternative\n\napartment, we likewise conclude that the trial court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment. “‘Unconscionable action or course of action’ means an act or\n\npractice which, to a consumer’s detriment, takes advantage of the lack of\n\nknowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of the consumer to a grossly unfair\n\ndegree.” TEX.

To be actionable under the statutory standard, the defendant must have\n\n                                        36\n\ftaken advantage of the consumer “to a grossly unfair degree,” meaning that “the\n\nresulting unfairness was glaringly noticeable, flagrant, complete and unmitigated.”\n\nChastain, 700 S.W.2d at 583–84. This determination is made “by examining the\n\nentire transaction and not by inquiring whether the defendant intended to take\n\nadvantage of the consumer or acted with knowledge or conscious indifference.”\n\nId. at 583.\n\n      The appellants’ summary-judgment evidence on this issue included\n\naffidavits from the Richardsons and Day stating that Almeda refused to address\n\ntheir issue with the noisy neighbors. Michelle testified that Almeda “would require\n\nus to move at our expense and inconvenience.”         They also offered Steven’s\n\ndeposition testimony describing the noise issues and how that made the apartment\n\nunusable. However, the portions of his deposition testimony proffered in response\n\nto both the traditional and no-evidence motions for summary judgment did not\n\naddress any actions taken by Almeda. Similarly, the portions of Day’s deposition\n\nthat the appellants relied upon to refute Almeda’s no-evidence motion say nothing\n\nabout the actions of the apartment complex. Finally, the appellants also produced\n\nleases for their neighbors’ apartments, which contain the same boilerplate\n\nprovisions regarding limitations on conduct, such as a prohibition against behaving\n\nin “a loud or obnoxious manner.” However, the leases all also say that Almeda\n\n“may” exclude guests or others who “in our judgment” violate the lease or\n\n                                        37\n\fapartment rules. Though the appellants’ evidence shows that Almeda declined to\n\nexclude or evict the noisy neighbors, in light of the discretion afforded in the lease\n\ncontract, none of the appellants’ evidence shows that Almeda took advantage of\n\nthe appellants “to a grossly unfair degree,” See id. at 583–84. Accordingly, we\n\nhold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on this ground,\n\nand we overrule the appellants’ first issue.\n\n   VII. Attorney’s fees\n\n      In their eighth issue, the appellants challenge the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Almeda. In its motion for summary judgment, Almeda argued\n\nthat it had incurred “approximately $8,000.00 in reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees defending against Plaintiffs’ claims and $4,000.00 in reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees prosecuting [its] counterclaims.” Almeda attached\n\nthe affidavit of its attorney, James Muska, to support its fees claim. Muska’s\n\naffidavit described the actions taken in the course of his representation. He also\n\nattested that his hourly rate is $175 and that he spent approximately 68 hours\n\nworking on the matter, with approximately 46 hours spent “defending against\n\nPlaintiffs’ claims asserted in this action” and approximately 22 hours “for\n\nprosecuting Defendant’s counterclaims.” Finally, he attested to a total of $40,000\n\nin contingent appellate attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f      In response, the appellants produced no controverting evidence, but they\n\nargued that Almeda was not entitled to attorney’s fees on its counterclaim because\n\nit was not entitled to prevail on that claim. They also argued that Almeda was not\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees for defending against their claims because the evidence\n\nwas insufficient to establish that contractual and noncontractual claims were\n\ninextricably intertwined.\n\n      First, although the appellants challenge the full $12,000 award of trial\n\nattorney’s fees, they made no challenge to the $4,000 award for the counterclaim\n\nexcept to say that Almeda was not entitled to such fees unless it prevailed. Under\n\nTexas law, a party may recover reasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or\n\ncorporation, in addition to the amount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for\n\nbreach of an oral or written contract. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 38.001(8) (West 2008). The lease provided certain remedies upon a tenant’s\n\ndefault, including recovery of costs and attorney’s fees:\n\n      Unless a party is seeking exemplary, punitive, sentimental, or\n      personal-injury damages, the prevailing party may recover from the\n      non-prevailing party attorney’s fees and all other litigation costs. We\n      [Almeda] may recover attorney’s fees in connection with enforcing\n      our rights under this Lease Contract.\n\nBecause the summary-judgment evidence does not create a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to the award of $4,000 in attorney’s fees for prosecution of its\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fbreach-of-contract counterclaim, we hold that the trial court did not err in\n\nrendering such judgment.\n\n      Second, we consider the award of $8,000 in trial attorney’s fees for\n\ndefending against the appellants’ claims. In its first amended answer, Almeda\n\nalleged that the appellants’ DTPA claims, TDCPA claims, and fair housing act\n\nclaims were brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. However,\n\nAlmeda made no mention in its motion for summary judgment of entitlement to\n\nattorney’s fees as a sanction. Thus, the trial court’s summary judgment for $8,000\n\nis not supportable on the ground that it is a sanction. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c)\n\n(“Issues not expressly presented to the trial court by written motion, answer or\n\nother response shall not be considered on appeal as grounds for reversal.”).\n\n      Thus, we must determine if Almeda’s summary-judgment proof established\n\nits entitlement to the $8,000 attorney’s fee award.

The\n\nSupreme Court of Texas has held that “when the causes of action involved in the\n\nsuit are dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances and thus are\n\n‘interwined to the point of being inseparable,’ the party suing for attorney’s fees\n\nmay recover the entire amount covering all claims.” Stewart Title Guar.

Chapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2006), in which it held, “Intertwined facts\n\ndo not make tort fees recoverable; it is only when discrete legal services advance\n\nboth a recoverable and unrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they\n\nneed not be segregated.” 212 S.W.3d at 313–14. The Court noted:\n\n      But Sterling was certainly correct that many if not most legal fees in\n      such cases cannot and need not be precisely allocated to one claim or\n      the other. Many of the services involved in preparing a contract or\n      DTPA claim for trial must still be incurred if tort claims are appended\n      to it; adding the latter claims does not render the former services\n      unrecoverable. Requests for standard disclosures, proof of background\n      facts, depositions of the primary actors, discovery motions and\n      hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of other services may be\n      necessary whether a claim is filed alone or with others. To the extent\n      such services would have been incurred on a recoverable claim alone,\n      they are not disallowed simply because they do double service.\n\nId. at 313.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\f      The summary-judgment evidence in this case affirmatively demonstrates\n\nthat some discrete legal services were rendered only for claims for which\n\nattorney’s fees are not recoverable. For example, Muska’s affidavit attests that he\n\nreviewed DTPA demand letters and conferred with his client about the allegations\n\nin them. The DTPA provides that “[e]ach consumer who prevails shall be awarded\n\ncourt costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees.” TEX. BUS. & COM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 17.50. But the statute makes no other provision for attorney’s fees\n\nfor defending a non-frivolous DTPA claim. The same is true for the Fair Housing\n\nAct and Debt Collection Act claims.          Because Almeda’s summary-judgment\n\nevidence shows discrete legal services rendered for some claims for which\n\nattorney’s fees are unrecoverable, yet does not show segregation of attorney’s fees\n\nbetween recoverable and non-recoverable claims, we hold that the trial court erred\n\nin awarding $8,000 in attorney’s fees for defending against all of the appellants’\n\nclaims.   See Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313–14.           Because Almeda\n\nprevailed in its motion for summary judgment on the appellants’ breach-of-\n\ncontract claim, and the lease specifically provided that “the prevailing party may\n\nrecover from the non-prevailing party attorney’s fees,” remand is appropriate.
