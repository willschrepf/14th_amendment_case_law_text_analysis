First Amended Complaint for Declaratory\n\nRelief (“Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 43 -45. The defendant denies breaching the settlement\n\nagreement and has filed a counterclaim seeking, inter alia, a declaration from the Court\n\nthat it was in fact the plaintiffs who breached the settlement agreement. First Amended\n\nCounterclaim; Jury Trial Demanded (“Am. Countercl.”) ¶¶ 37-42. Currently before the\n\nCourt is the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and the defendant’s cross-motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), and the\n\nplaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, and VII of the defendant’s\n\ncounterclaim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Upon careful review\n\nof the pleadings filed by the parties, their motions, and all memoranda and exhibits\n\nsubmitted in support of those motions, for the reasons that follow, the Court will grant\n\fsummary judgment to the plaintiffs and deny the defendant’s cross-motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment. The Court will also grant the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Counts I,\n\nIII, IV, V, VI, and VII of the defendant’s counterclaim.\n\n                                           I. Factual Background1\n\n        A.         The Relationship Between the Parties\n\n        The parties’ underlying relationship began in 2001 when the plaintiffs, a law firm\n\nand Mr. Cuneo, who “holds an interest in [the firm,]” initially employed the defendant as\n\none of the firm’s staff attorneys, Am. Compl. ¶ 12; Verified Answer to the First\n\nAmended Complaint and Counterclaim2 (“Verified Answer”) ¶ 12; Memorandum of\n\nPoints and Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to their\n\nAction for Declaratory Judgment and Plaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss and/or for Summary\n\nJudgment as to Defendant Joseph’s Counterclaims (“Pls.’ Mem. I”) ¶ 2,3 and later as an\n\nindependent contractor, Pl.’s Mem. I, Affidavit of Jonathan W. Cuneo (“Cuneo Aff.”) ¶\n\n2. While employed by the plaintiffs, the defendant worked on “the preliminary stages”\n\nof three contingency fee cases, the Gold Train, Leatherman, and Kwikset cases. Pls.’\n\n\n\n        1\n            The facts set forth below are either admitted or are not in dispute.\n        2\n           The defendant combined his answer and counterclaim into his Verified Answer to the First\nAmended Complaint and Counterclaim (“Verified Answer”). The defendant later amended his\ncounterclaim in his First Amended Counterclaim without amending the Verified Answer. Therefore, when\nreferring to the defendant’s answer to the plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Declaratory Relief, the\nCourt will reference the defendant’s initial Verified Answer.\n        3\n          The plaintiffs filed their initial motion for summary judgment on March 27, 2008; however,\nbecause the defendant filed an amended counterclaim, the plaintiffs filed a new motion for summary\njudgment on June 11, 2008. Their new motion and supporting memorandum incorporate the original\narguments advanced in their initial motion and supporting memorandum without further reiteration.\nBecause the original arguments are incorporated in this manner, the court will have to reference both\nmemoranda in this opinion and distinguish them by referring to the first submission as “I” and the second\nsubmission as “II.”\n\n                                                        2\n\fMem. I, Cuneo Aff.” ¶ 2; Am. Compl. ¶ 20; Pls.’ Mem. I at 1. The relationship between\n\nthe plaintiffs and the defendant began to deteriorate for a variety of reasons and was\n\nultimately terminated when the defendant filed a lawsuit against the plaintiffs on August\n\n20, 2001 (the “2001 Lawsuit”). Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 3 & Exhibit (“Ex.”) A\n\n(Complaint, Joseph v. Cuneo Law Group, P.C., No. 1:01CV01755, Oct. 3, 2001) (“2001\n\nCompl.”). In the 2001 Lawsuit, the defendant alleged, inter alia, that the plaintiffs: (1)\n\nwere liable for breach of the employment contract between him and the law firm, and (2)\n\nthat the plaintiffs were guilty of unjust enrichment and conversion. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo\n\nAff. ¶ 3 & Ex. A, (“2001 Compl.”). Furthermore, the defendant demanded payment of\n\nany money that the plaintiffs owed him. Am. Compl. ¶ 15; Verified Answer ¶ 15. The\n\nplaintiffs refused to pay the funds being requested by the defendant because they had\n\nreceived a garnishment notice from the District of Columbia, which required that any\n\npayment owed to the defendant be delayed.4 Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13-14; Verified Answer ¶¶\n\n13-14. While the 2001 Lawsuit was in litigation, the defendant filed liens in the\n\nplaintiffs’ pending cases and contacted the plaintiffs’ various co-counsel in those cases.\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 16; Verified Answer ¶ 16. Ultimately, the parties entered into a settlement\n\nagreement on March 15, 2002, resolving the defendant’s 2001 Lawsuit. Pls.’ Mem. I,\n\nCuneo Aff. ¶ 4 & Ex. B (Agreement of Release) (the “2002 Settlement Agreement”).\n\n\n\n\n         4\n           The defendant objects to Cuneo’s reasoning for withholding payment, asserting that the plaintiffs\nwere holding “[t]he funds . . . in trust for payment of a health insurance policy for [the defendant] and his\nthree sons,” and therefore, according to the defendant, “had no right not to pay the insurance premium.”\nVerified Answer ¶ 14.\n\n                                                     3\n\f         B.       The 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\n         The 2002 Settlement Agreement “provided that [the defendant] was to receive 20\n\npercent (20%) of Cuneo’s net fees, if any, in three (3) then-pending plaintiffs’\n\ncontingency fee cases, referred to as the Gold Train Case, the Leatherman Case, and the\n\nKwikset Case.” Am. Compl. ¶ 20; Verified Answer ¶ 20. The parties included a non-\n\ninterference clause in the 2002 Settlement Agreement, which states that “[the defendant]\n\nshall make no attempt to interfere with the pending cases or cases that follow, nor shall\n\nhe attempt to file liens or notices of claims, or correspond with the litigants. If [the\n\ndefendant] does he has breached the agreement and waives his percentages.” Pls.’ Mem.\n\nI, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (2002 Settlement Agreement). The defendant “also agreed in\n\nwriting to ‘release all liens’ and ‘not file any independent fee applications’ and to\n\n‘cooperate’ with [the plaintiffs] ‘reasonably in the prosecution of [the three pending\n\ncontingency fee] cases.’” Am. Compl. ¶ 22; Verified Answer ¶ 22.\n\n         C.       The Defendant’s Alleged Breach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\n         The plaintiffs allege that in January 2006, payment was received for the Gold\n\nTrain case,5 Am. Compl. ¶ 23, and from those funds the plaintiffs paid and the defendant\n\naccepted $240,895 in accordance with the 2002 Settlement Agreement.6 Pls.’ Mem. I,\n\n\n\n         5\n         The defendant states that he believes the plaintiffs received payment in the Gold Train case in\nDecember 2005. Verified Answer ¶ 23.\n         6\n            The defendant never disputes the amount that the plaintiffs assert was forwarded to him pursuant\nto the 20% he was entitled to receive under the terms of the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Furthermore, the\nplaintiffs “withheld $50,000 as a reserve to cover [expenses associated with the disbursement of the\nsettlement agreement], and paid [the defendant] 20% of [the plaintiffs’] fees after such amount was\nwithheld.” See Statement of Material Facts as to which there is No Genuine Issue in Support of Plaintiffs’\nOpposition to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to his Breach of Contract Claim ¶ 12.\nAccording to the defendant, he was told by an individual associated with the plaintiff law firm that he\nwould receive the withheld funds “within 90 days.” Verified Answer ¶ 24.\n\n                                                     4\n\fCuneo Aff. ¶ 7; Am. Compl. ¶ 24; Verified Answer ¶ 24. However, despite accepting\n\nthis payment and in disregard of the 2002 Settlement Agreement, the defendant contacted\n\nthe plaintiffs’ co-counsel in the Gold Train case, demanding an additional 20% “finders\n\nfee” for his work on that case. Am. Compl. ¶ 26; Verified Answer ¶ 26, 31; Pls.’ Mem. I,\n\nCuneo Aff. ¶ 8.7 Upon receipt of the defendant’s demand letter, the plaintiffs’ co-counsel\n\nin the Gold Train case notified the plaintiffs of the defendant’s demand, Pls.’ Mem. I at\n\n2; Cuneo Aff. ¶ 8 & Ex. E (Letter to the defendant from the plaintiffs’ counsel, Jan, 19,\n\n2006.), and the plaintiffs informed the defendant that his conduct constituted a material\n\nbreach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement, id. Then, on February 24, 2006, the defendant\n\nfiled a complaint against the plaintiffs’ co-counsel seeking one-third of their fees from\n\nthe Gold Train case. Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 9 & Ex. F (Complaint, Joseph v.\n\nDubbin, No. 06-20464, Feb. 24, 2006). On December 22, 2006, the case against the\n\nplaintiffs’ co-counsel was dismissed with prejudice, which Joseph appealed. Id., Cuneo\n\nAff. ¶ 9 & Ex. H (Docket, Joseph v. Dubbin, No. 06-20464). The parties to that lawsuit\n\nthen engaged in negotiations, which resulted in a settlement, and the case was dismissed\n\nwith prejudice on March 15, 2007. Id.\n\n         On February 12, 2008, the plaintiffs “received payment in the Leatherman Case.”\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 41. The plaintiffs promptly filed the present lawsuit claiming that the\n\ndefendant had “lost . . . entitlement to any share [of] the fee in the Leatherman Case” due\n\nto his prior interference in the Gold Train case. Id. ¶ 42. Consequently, pursuant to the\n\n\n         7\n            The plaintiffs contend that the amount the defendant initially demanded was for an additional\nfinders fee of 20 %, although the defendant does not explicitly admit that he demanded an amount equal to\n20%, he never disputes the plaintiffs’ contention as to the amount. Furthermore, the record reflects that he\ndid in fact demand an additional finders fee.\n\n                                                      5\n\fterms of the 2002 Settlement Agreement, the plaintiffs refused to release any of the\n\nproceeds from the Leatherman case to the defendant on the ground that he “waived his\n\nentitlement to a percentage of the Leatherman fee . . . .” Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶13.\n\n       D.      The Current Dispute\n\n       On February 15, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in this case, and\n\non February 26, 2008, they filed their amended complaint. After filing an initial answer\n\nand counterclaim on March 5, 2008, on May 22, 2008, the defendant filed an amended\n\ncounterclaim and answer asserting claims of legal malpractice; breach of the settlement\n\nagreement; quantum meruit; unjust enrichment; unfair trade practices under the District\n\nof Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act; intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress; and conversion. Am. Countercl. On June 11, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their\n\nmotion for summary judgment as to their request for declaratory judgement and their\n\nmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for motion for summary judgment on the\n\ndefendant’s counterclaim. The defendant then filed a memorandum on June 23, 2008, in\n\nopposition to the plaintiffs’ motions and also a separate cross-motion for partial summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                                     II. Legal Analysis\n\n       A.      The Plaintiffs’ Summary Judgment Motion\n\n       To grant a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56(c), this Court must find\n\nthat “the pleadings, the discovery, and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The Court must also view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Bayer v. U.S. Dept. of the\n\n                                             6\n\fTreasury, 956 F.2d 330, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1992). However, the nonmoving party cannot\n\nrely on “mere allegations or denials . . . but . . . must set forth specific facts showing that\n\nthere [are] genuine issue[s] for trial.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248\n\n(1986) (citation omitted) (some alterations in original). Therefore, under Rule 56(c), if a\n\nparty fails to “establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on\n\nwhich that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,” summary judgment is warranted.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). However, the party moving for\n\nsummary judgment bears the burden of establishing that there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the non-moving party’s case. Id. at 325.\n\n                1.      The Plaintiffs’ Breach of the Settlement Agreement Claim\n\n        The plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on their\n\nsettlement breach claim, arguing that the defendant materially breached the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement by interfering with the then-pending contingency fee cases, filing\n\na lawsuit against the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in one of those cases, and corresponding with\n\nthe litigants in that case, which violated the terms of the settlement agreement’s non-\n\ninterference clause. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-45. The defendant responds that he did not\n\nmaterially breach the 2002 Settlement Agreement because he contacted only “co-\n\ncounsel” and not the actual parties. Verified Answer ¶¶ 2, 25-26, 31. He further asserts\n\nthat “even if he did [breach the agreement], the paragraph in question [in the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement] . . . constitute[s] an illegal liquidated damages clause and [is\n\ntherefore] invalid.” Verified Answer ¶¶ 2, 31, 42, 44. The Court’s first task is to\n\ndetermine what the parties intended when they executed the non-interference clause of\n\nthe 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n                                               7\n\f                            a.       The Terms of the Non-Interference Clause of the 2002\n                                     Settlement Agreement\n\n         The parties dispute the meaning of the terms litigants and pending contained in\n\nthe 2002 Settlement Agreement. The defendant contends the term “litigants” does not\n\ninclude lawyers and the term “pending” means a case that has not been “settled.”8\n\nDefendant’s Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment and the Motion to Dismiss\n\nthe Counterclaim and Statement of Points and Authorities in Support of the Motion for\n\nPartial Summary Judgment (“Def.’s Opp’n I”) at 3.9 On the contrary, the plaintiffs argue\n\nthat “the term ‘litigants’ was intended to include [both the] parties and their attorneys”\n\nbecause “[n]one of the defendants in the pending cases were natural persons[,]” as\n\n“[t]hey were the United States and two corporations,” and therefore, the only way the\n\ndefendant “could have corresponded with a party defendant would be through its\n\nattorney.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 10. Furthermore, the plaintiffs contend that the term\n\n“pending” includes all cases covered by the settlement agreement, even if a case was\n\n“administratively closed,”10 so long as the settlement remained outstanding and the case\n\n\n\n\n         8\n           Although the defendant never adopts the term administratively closed, it is the Court’s\nunderstanding that the defendant is asserting that once a case has been “settled” and is closed, it is no\nlonger in a pending status.\n         9\n            Like the plaintiffs, see supra at n.2, the defendant filed his initial memorandum opposing\nplaintiffs’ motion for dismissal or summary judgment on April 14, 2008. After the plaintiffs filed a new\nmotion for summary judgment or dismissal, the defendant filed a new memorandum in opposition to that\nmotion on June 23, 2008, incorporating the arguments made in his original memorandum without actually\nfurther reiterating them. The Court will therefore have to reference both memoranda and will distinguish\nthem by referring to the first submission as “I” and the second submission as “II.”\n         10\n             The case that was the subject of the settlement agreement was also assigned to the judge in this\ncase at the time of the settlement. Cases are administratively closed by this judge solely for statistical and\ncase management purposes. Cases in this status usually have been settled but remain under the Court’s\nsupervision and can be administratively opened in the event problems arise with the settlement and the\nCourt’s intervention becomes necessary.\n\n                                                       8\n\fwas still under the Court’s jurisdiction, which was the status of the case the parties had\n\nagreed to settle. Id. at 10-11.\n\n       Settlement agreements “are in the nature of contracts.” America v. Preston, 468\n\nF. Supp. 2d 118, 122 (D.D.C. 2006) (quoting Makins v. District of Columbia, 277 F.3d\n\n544, 546-47 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (applying contract law to a settlement agreement dispute)).\n\nThus, “[t]he enforceability of a settlement agreement is governed by [ ] principles of\n\ncontract law.” Village of Kaktovik v. Watt, 689 F.2d 222, 230 & n.62 (D.C. Cir. 1982)\n\n(referring to United States v. ITT Cont’l Banking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238 (1975)); see\n\nalso Lloyd v. Mukasey, 568 F. Supp. 2d 2, 16 (D.D.C. 2008); Simon v. Circle Assocs.,\n\nInc., 753 A.2d 1006, 1012 (D.C. 2000).\n\n       When construing a contract to determine whether an interpretation of its terms is\n\nreasonable, courts “consider[] the intent of the parties entering the agreement and\n\nwhether a reasonable person in the position of the parties, knowing the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the agreement and the usages that either party knew or should have known,\n\nwould find it reasonable.” C&E Servs., Inc. v. Ashland Inc., 498 F. Supp. 2d 242, 265\n\n(D.D.C. 2007). “A court must honor the intentions of the parties as reflected in the\n\nsettled usage of the terms they accepted in the contract . . . and will not torture words to\n\nimport ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity.”\n\nUnfoldment, Inc. v. D.C. Contract Appeals Bd., 909 A.2d 204, 209 (D.C. 2006) (internal\n\ncitation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. Id. A contract is “not\n\nambiguous where the court can determine its meaning without any other guid[ance] than\n\na knowledge of the simple facts on which, from the nature of language in general, its\n\n                                              9\n\fmeaning depends.” Wash. Props., Inc. v. Chin, Inc., 760 A.2d 546, 548 (D.C. 2000)\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). On the other hand, “if there is more than\n\none interpretation that a reasonable person could ascribe to the contract, while viewing\n\nthe contract in context of the circumstances surrounding its making, the contract is\n\nambiguous.” Gryce v. Lavine, 675 A.2d 67, 69 (D.C. 1996).\n\n         Here, the issue of whether the parties intended the terms litigants to include\n\nlawyers and pending to include the implementation stage of the settlement distribution\n\nmust be derived from the language of the 2002 Settlement Agreement and what a\n\nreasonable person in the position of the parties would have intended each term to mean.\n\nThe pertinent part of the 2002 Settlement Agreement states: “Joel Joseph shall make no\n\nattempt to interfere with the pending case or cases that follow, nor shall he attempt to file\n\nliens or notices of claim, or correspond with the litigants. If he does he has breached the\n\nagreement and waives his percentages.” Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 4 & Ex. B (2002\n\nSettlement Agreement).\n\n         The plaintiffs’ argument that the parties intended the term “litigants” to also\n\ninclude the attorneys representing the parties is persuasive. The three lawsuits covered\n\nby the 2002 Settlement Agreement involved class action suits against the United States\n\nand two corporations. Plaintiffs’ Reply in Support of their Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment as to their Action for Declaratory Judgment and Motion to Dismiss and/or for\n\nSummary Judgment as to Defendant Joseph’s Counterclaims (“Pls.’ Reply I”) at 4.11\n\n\n         11\n            The Court notes that the plaintiffs assert that the three continency fee cases involved the United\nStates and two corporations, and the defendant never disputes this contention. Furthermore, the plaintiffs\ninclude a copy of the Final Order and Judgment in the Gold Train case, which illustrates that Gold Train\nwas in fact against the United States. See Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. C (Final Order and Judgment).\n\n                                                      10\n\fTherefore, the only plausible means of corresponding with the defendants would\n\nnecessarily have been through their attorneys. Consequently, a reasonable person in the\n\nposition of either the plaintiffs or the defendant, all of whom were attorneys, would have\n\nunderstood that the term litigants included the attorneys representing the parties. The\n\ndefendant’s assertion that the term litigants excluded the attorneys, absent any such\n\nexclusionary language, totally lacks credibility.\n\n       Additionally, the plaintiffs’ argument that the parties intended the term “pending\n\ncases” to include “administratively closed” cases covered by the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement while the settlement remained outstanding is equally persuasive. Pls.’ Mem.\n\nI at 10-11. The context in which the 2002 Settlement Agreement was executed is an\n\nimportant consideration. See C&E Servs., 498 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (stating that a court\n\nmust consider “the intent of the parties entering the agreement and whether a reasonable\n\nperson in the position of the parties, knowing the circumstances surrounding the\n\nagreement and the usages that either party knew or should have known, would find [the\n\nterm pending cases] reasonable.”) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Both parties\n\nwere aware of the cases that were covered by the agreement, Pl.’s Mem. I, Ex. B (Cuneo\n\nAff.) ¶ 7 (“The terms set forth in the attached exhibits are part of this release”) & Ex. A\n\n(listing “the Gold Train, Leatherman, and Kwikset cases as well as any directly related\n\nlitigation” as the cases covered by the settlement agreement), and there is no indication in\n\nthe agreement that some unspecified event would exempt any of these cases from the\n\nagreement’s coverage. Therefore, any reasonable person would interpret the term\n\npending cases to include all three cases until such time as the conditions of the settlement\n\nagreement were satisfied. The defendant’s efforts to inject non-existent limiting\n\n                                             11\n\flanguage, specifically that a case that has been settled and closed is no longer “pending,”\n\nDef’s Opp’n I at 3, into the agreement echo the efforts of the plaintiff in Howell ex rel.\n\nD.H. v. District of Columbia and must be rejected for the same reason here. See 522 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 57, 63 (D.D.C. 2007) (noting that “[t]he plaintiff bases her entire breach of\n\ncontract argument on language that simply does not appear in the settlement agreement . .\n\n. .”).\n\n         In Howell, the court rejected the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant breached a\n\nsettlement agreement. Id. While the settlement agreement itself did not include a\n\nspecific time frame during which the defendant would provide the agreed-to services, the\n\nnotes of the resolution meeting indicated that the defendant would require “at least 90\n\ndays” to provide the services. Id. The court stated that, “although the [language in the]\n\nsettlement agreement [] ma[de] no mention” or express limitation of the time frame\n\nduring which the defendant would provide the services, the court would accept the\n\n“settled usage” of the express terms that the parties memorialized in their meeting, not\n\nthe limiting language that the plaintiff alleged. Id. Therefore, the plaintiff could not\n\ninject her proposed limiting language into the agreement.\n\n         In this case, the defendant attempts to limit the meaning of the term pending cases\n\njust as the plaintiff in Howell attempted to impose an unexpressed limitation on the\n\nphrase “at least 90-days” in her settlement agreement to mean that after ninety days the\n\ndefendant was in breach. Id. The Howell Court rejected the plaintiff’s attempts to\n\n“torture” the agreement’s terms to benefit her reasoning and, instead, “honor[ed]” the\n\naccepted language of the terms of the contract. Id. This Court agrees with the court’s\n\nreasoning in Howell, concluding that the term pending cases, in the face of specific cases\n\n                                              12\n\fbeing expressly identified in the agreement, leaves no room for any interpretation other\n\nthan the parties were referring to the cases identified in the agreement, and that these\n\ncases would remain subject to the terms of the agreement until such time as the\n\nconditions of the agreement were satisfied. Therefore, the Court must “honor the\n\nintentions of the parties as reflected in the settled usage of the terms they accepted in the\n\ncontract . . . and will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning\n\nleaves not room for ambiguity.” Id. at 63 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted,\n\nemphases added).\n\n                       b.      Did the defendant’s actions constitute a material breach of\n                               the 2002 Settlement Agreement?\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the defendant materially breached the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement by “deliberately” interfering with the Gold Train case despite repeated\n\nwarnings by the plaintiffs. Pls.’ Mem. I at 10. The defendant contends that he did not\n\nbreach the 2002 Settlement Agreement, but that even if he did, “such breach was minor\n\nand did not substantially harm [the] plaintiff[s].” Am. Countercl. ¶ 40.\n\n       If the defendant engaged in conduct that constituted a material breach of the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement, conduct that “go[es] to the essence and frustrate[s] substantially\n\nthe purpose for which the contract was agreed to by the injured party,” then under the\n\nterms of the settlement agreement, he is not entitled to any payments provided by the\n\nagreement. Draim v. Virtual Geosatellite Holdings, Inc., 522 F.3d 452, 454-55 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting Keefe Co. v. Americable Int’l, Inc., 755 A.2d 469, 475 (D.C. 2000).\n\n“[W]hether a material breach has occurred is generally a question of fact[]” unless “there\n\nis only one reasonable conclusion,” with the result being that the “court must address\n\n\n                                             13\n\fwhat is ordinarily a factual question as a question of law.” 23 Williston on Contracts §\n\n63:3 (4th ed. 2009); see also America, 468 F. Supp. 2d at 122.\n\n       In determining whether a material breach has occurred, the Court must consider:\n\n       the extent to which [the] plaintiff[s] will be deprived of the benefit which\n       [they] reasonably expected under the contract; the extent to which the\n       plaintiff[s] can be adequately compensated for the part of that benefit of\n       which [they] will be deprived; the extent to which the defendant will\n       suffer forfeiture; the likelihood that the defendant will cure his failure,\n       taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable\n       assurances; and the extent to which the behavior of the defendant\n       comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nAmerica, 468 F. Supp. 2d at 125 (citing Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Bender, 595 F. Supp.\n\n1209, 1224 (D.D.C. 1984)). The Court may also consider the extent to which “the\n\ncontract has been performed at the time of the breach[,]” whether the breach was willful\n\nrather than “by negligence or by extraneous circumstances[,]” and whether “the breach\n\nwas quantitatively serious.” Greyhound, 595 F. Supp. at 1224 (internal citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Here, the question that must be answered is whether the defendant’s\n\ncommunication with the plaintiffs’ co-counsel went to the essence of the agreement, and\n\nthus, interfered with or substantially frustrated the purpose for which the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement was reached. The plaintiffs contend that the non-interference clause was\n\nadded to the 2002 Settlement Agreement due to the defendant’s “prior conduct,” which\n\nincluded filing liens in other cases in which the plaintiff law firm was involved as\n\ncounsel. Pls.’ Mem. I at 8. The defendant disputes the plaintiffs’ contention, but does\n\nnot offer an alternative argument as to why the parties agreed to include the non-\n\ninterference clause. Def.’s Opp’n I at 1. The Court finds that the plaintiffs’ position is\n\n\n                                             14\n\fthe only reasonable explanation for the inclusion of the clause in the absence of any other\n\nexplanation provided by the defendant. Moreover, the prior history between the parties\n\nalso supports the plaintiffs’ position, illustrated by the fact that in 2001 the plaintiffs took\n\nexception to the defendant’s behavior at that time, which consisted of the defendant filing\n\nliens and contacting the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in their pending cases. Am. Compl. ¶ 16.\n\nTo prevent the defendant from engaging in similar behavior, the parties entered into the\n\n2002 Settlement Agreement. See Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 5. These circumstances\n\nlogically support the plaintiffs’ position that the non-interference clause was included in\n\nthe settlement agreement because of the defendant’s behavior during the course of the\n\nprior lawsuit between the parties. As further support for the plaintiffs’ position, the last\n\nsentence in paragraph six of the 2002 Settlement Agreement makes it strikingly clear that\n\nthe non-interference requirement was essential to the continued validity of the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement. Pls.’ Mem. I at 6. Specifically, the language states that if the\n\ndefendant attempted to interfere with the pending cases, attempted to file liens or notices\n\nof claims, or corresponded with the litigants in the cases that were covered by the\n\nagreement, “he [will have] breached the [2002 Settlement] Agreement and waiv[ed] his\n\npercentages” of the fees agreed to in the agreement Id.\n\n        The plaintiffs assert that the defendant improperly interfered in the Gold Train\n\ncase, Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 9, when he deliberately contacted their co-counsel on\n\nseveral occasions despite the language of the 2002 Settlement Agreement prohibiting\n\nsuch behavior. As noted earlier, the defendant demanded a 20% fee from the plaintiffs’\n\nco-counsel in one of the three cases covered by the settlement agreement for work he\n\nperformed in that case even though he had already received $240,895 in accordance with\n\n                                              15\n\fthe settlement agreement. Pls.’ Mem. I at 2. The defendant was made aware by the\n\nplaintiffs that his actions were not in compliance with the 2002 Settlement Agreement,\n\nbut he nonetheless continued to communicate with the plaintiffs’ co-counsel,\n\ndisregarding multiple letters from the plaintiffs informing him that he was in material\n\nbreach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement by doing so. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. E.\n\n(Letter from the plaintiffs’ counsel to the defendant, Feb. 10, 2006.)\n\n       In America, the court found that the defendant breached a settlement agreement\n\nwhich contained a provision stating that “all inquiries [about the plaintiff] from\n\nprospective employers received by [the defendant’s agency] shall be referred to and\n\nhandled by the Agency’s Office of Human Resources.” 468 F. Supp. 2d at 123. The\n\ncourt found that the defendant breached the settlement agreement when two of the\n\ndefendant’s employees failed to refer calls inquiring about the plaintiff to the human\n\nresources department “as required by . . . the settlement agreement.” Id. at 124. The\n\ncourt noted that “the provision [at issue] requir[ed] an employee of the defendant to have\n\nno substantive communications with prospective employers, and to immediately forward\n\ncalls from such persons to its Human Resources Department.” Id. The Court further\n\npointed out that “[t]here [was] no question that [the employees] reasonably believed that\n\nthe caller [who was making an inquiry about the plaintiff] was in fact a prospective\n\nemployer and they still did not comply with that requirement.” Id. The court, therefore\n\nheld that the defendant had breached the settlement agreement.\n\n       Here, the settlement agreement contains express language forbidding the\n\ndefendant from “fil[ing] any independent fee applications, and [failing to] . . . cooperate\n\nwith the Cuneo Law Group reasonably in the prosecution of these cases,” or “mak[ing]\n\n                                             16\n\f[any] attempt to file liens or notices of claim, or correspond with the litigants,” Pls.’\n\nMem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. B, just as the settlement agreement in America prohibited the\n\ndefendant’s agency from failing to refer inquiries about the plaintiff to the agency’s\n\nhuman resources department. Moreover, whereas the defendant in America only had\n\n“reasonabl[e] belie[f]” that the defendant was in breach of the settlement agreement, 468\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 124, the plaintiffs in this case actually warned the defendant that he was\n\nbreaching the settlement agreement. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 8. Thus, the Court is\n\ncompelled to find that the defendant materially breached the 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n       The magnitude of the breach cannot be considered minor because the defendant’s\n\nconduct went further than simply communicating with litigants, as he subsequently filed\n\na claim against the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in the Gold Train case in the federal District\n\nCourt in Miami, suing not for just 20% as he previously demanded on January 10, 2006,\n\nfrom the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in that case, Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 8, but rather “1/3\n\nof their fees.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 2. And when the defendant filed suit against the plaintiffs’\n\nco-counsel, “[t]o avoid further interference and disruption to the Gold Train case,” the\n\nplaintiffs “agreed to indemnify [their] co-counsel against [the defendant’s] suit.\n\nStatement of Material Facts as to which there is No Genuine Issue in Support of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to His Breach of\n\nContract Counterclaim (“Pls.’ Stmt.”) ¶ 9. [However, the plaintiffs also] retained counsel\n\nto defend the suit in Miami[, and] Miami counsel succeeded twice in having [the\n\ndefendant’s] suit dismissed for failure to state a claim, the second time with prejudice.\n\nId. [The plaintiffs] ultimately paid a sum of money to settle the case on behalf of [their]\n\nco-counsel.” Id. As a result of the defendant pursuing the Miami litigation, the plaintiffs\n\n                                              17\n\fincurred “out-of-pocket costs, including the settlement, but excluding the time spent and\n\nthe plaintiffs’ overhead costs, were in excess of $35,000.” Id. And in addition to the\n\nplaintiffs’ monetary expenses, they expended nearly one year defending against the\n\nMiami case. Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo’s Aff. ¶ 9 & Ex. H (Docket, Joseph v. Dubbin, No.\n\n1:06-cv-20464). These expenditures of time and money were exactly what the plaintiffs\n\nsought to avoid through the execution of the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Nonetheless,\n\nthe defendant insists that the Court should disregard his actions, even if they amounted to\n\na breach of the settlement agreement, and focus on the extent of the harm he will suffer if\n\nthe Court enforces the 2002 Settlement Agreement’s forfeiture clause.\n\n       Although the defendant disagrees, Def.’s Opp’n I at 5, the extent of his loss\n\nresulting from the forfeiture provided in the settlement agreement is but one of eight\n\nfactors that the Court may consider when assessing the materiality of a breach. See\n\nAmerica, 468 F. Supp. 2d at 125 (delineating factors that a court is to consider when\n\ndetermining whether there has been a material breach of an agreement). Accordingly,\n\nwhile the defendant’s loss from the forfeiture would exceed $400,000, this factor alone\n\nis insufficient to defeat the plaintiffs’ forfeiture claims. See S. Brooke Purll, Inc. V.\n\nVailes, 850 A.2d 1135, 1139 (D.C. 2004) (rejecting the trial court’s determination that a\n\nforfeiture clause was an invalid penalty because it was completely disproportionate to the\n\ncontractor’s actual loss and instead finding that the “burden was on the owner”of the\n\nhouse being renovated to show that the clause was “disproportionate to the contractor’s\n\nanticipated damages in the event of a breach”)(emphasis added). This is particularly true\n\nin this case because any loss sustained by the defendant would have been occasioned by\n\nhis own conduct. As previously demonstrated, the defendant knowingly and deliberately\n\n                                              18\n\facted in a manner that was directly at odds with the non-interference clause of the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement. While courts will not enforce forfeiture provisions that constitute\n\na penalty, such provisions will be upheld where it is otherwise appropriate to do so, as the\n\nNeuffer v. Bakery & Confectionary Workers International Union of American case\n\ndemonstrates. 307 F.2d 671, 671-73 (D.C. Cir. 1962). In Neuffer, a plaintiff\n\nunsuccessfully sought the resumption of pension payments from his union after violating\n\na provision under which individuals forfeited all benefits upon being found in violation\n\nof the Union’s constitution. Id. The court in Neuffer held that the plaintiff was not\n\nentitled to his pension because he had voluntarily brought himself within the terms of an\n\nexpress forfeiture clause, noting that while a trivial offense might not justify complete\n\nforfeiture, the plaintiff’s efforts to induce the Union’s members to join a rival union did\n\nnot qualify as trivial. Id. at 672-73. Similarly, in this case, the defendant’s anti-forfeiture\n\nargument fails because he voluntarily brought himself within the terms of the forfeiture\n\nclause and his non-compliant conduct was not trivial; in fact, it frustrated a critical\n\ncomponent and objective of the 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n       In addition, the defendant’s behavior was not a breach based on a mere\n\ntechnicality; rather, his behavior caused the plaintiffs to spend more than $35,000\n\ndefending against the Miami litigation, which took nearly a year to resolve. On this\n\nrecord, the Court can only conclude that the plaintiffs were deprived of a critical benefit\n\nfor which they had bargained when they entered into the settlement agreement with the\n\ndefendant and that the defendant’s actions therefore amounted to a material breach of the\n\n2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f                       c.      Was the non-interference clause a liquidated damages\n                               provision?\n\n       The defendant relies on District Cablevision Ltd. Partnership v. Bassin, 828 A.2d\n\n714 (D.C. 2003), for the proposition that “voiding [his] $460,000 fee [would]\n\nconsititute[] an illegal penalty” because the amount “bears no reasonable relationship to\n\nthe actual costs incurred by [the plaintiffs],” which he contends at most totaled\n\n“$12,500.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 5. The plaintiffs argue, on the other hand, that the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement is not an unlawful liquidated damages penalty because “[i]t states\n\nno amount, percentage, or other formula. It does not state that [the defendant] owes [the\n\nplaintiffs] anything in the event of a breach.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 12.\n\n       The defendant’s reliance on Bassin is misplaced. Bassin states, as the defendant\n\naccurately quotes in his opposition memorandum, that a penalty occurs:\n\n       when a contract specifies a single sum in damages for any and all breaches\n       even though it is apparent that all are not of the same gravity, the\n       specification is not a reasonable effort to estimate damages; and when in\n       addition the fixed sum greatly exceeds the actual damages likely to be\n       inflicted by a minor breach . . . 828 A.2d at 724 (citation and internal\n       quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, the 2002 Settlement Agreement does not specify a single sum in damages that\n\nthe plaintiff would receive if the agreement was breached; instead, the settlement\n\nagreement simply states that the defendant will forfeit his percentages if he does not\n\ncomply with paragraph six (the non-interference clause) of the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement. In addition, as indicated above, the breach occasioned by the defendant’s\n\nconduct was not minor, but to the contrary was significant. Therefore, the Bassin\n\nproscription is not applicable to the facts presented in this case.\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       As previously noted, part of the 2002 Settlement Agreement states that “Joseph\n\nshall make no attempt to interfere with the pending cases or cases that follow, nor shall\n\nhe attempt to file liens or notices of claim, or correspond with the litigants. If he does he\n\nhas breached the agreement and waives his percentages.” Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex.\n\nB. In assessing whether a provision in a contract amounts to a liquidated damages\n\nclause, the Court’s first inquiry is whether the clause serves as a remedy for the breach of\n\nthe contract. See Red Sage Ltd. P’ship v. Despa Deutsche Sparkassen Immobilien-\n\nAnlage-Gasells-Chaft MBH, 254 F.3d 1120, 1125 (D.C. Cir. 2001). To determine if a\n\ncontractual clause is a remedy, District of Columbia law requires that courts look to the\n\nwritten language of the contract which governs the dispute, “unless it is not susceptible of\n\na clear meaning.” Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In Red Sage, a District of Columbia restaurant sought a declaration from the\n\ncourt that its landlord breached an exclusive-use contract that was part of its lease. Id. at\n\n1122. The restaurant alleged that its landlord breached the agreement by leasing space to\n\na specialty cake shop in the same building. Id. Furthermore, the restaurant claimed that\n\nanother clause in the lease agreement reduced its monthly rent by 50% during the period\n\nwhile the competing-use business operated on the premises. Id. at 1123. Specifically,\n\nthe clause in question stated that “rent . . . shall be abated” by 50% if the landlord\n\nviolated his obligations under the contract. Id. Additionally, the contract stated that the\n\nrent abatement “shall not limit any other remedies which [the t]enant may have against\n\n[the l]andlord for violating its obligations under this Section.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\nWhile the restaurant claimed that this was not a liquidated damages clause, and was\n\ninstead a readjustment of its rent based on changed conditions, the court concluded that\n\n                                              21\n\fthe language created a liquidated damage clause because it indicated the parties’ intent to\n\nprovide a remedy in the event the lease was breached as a result of space in the building\n\nbeing leased to a competing business. Id. at 1125\n\n       As in Red Sage, the language used in this case in the 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\nindicates that the non-interference clause was intended to be a liquidated damages clause.\n\nTo reiterate, the clause reads, in part, that “Joseph shall make no attempt to interfere with\n\nthe pending cases or cases that follow, nor shall he attempt to file liens or notices of\n\nclaim, or correspond with the litigants. If he does he has breached the agreement and\n\nwaives his percentages.” See Pls.’ Mem. I at 6 (emphasis added) (citing 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement ¶ 6). The clause in Red Sage used nearly identical language, such as use of\n\nthe terms “shall be” and “shall not.” 254 F.3d at 1125. The language in the settlement\n\nagreement indicates that a remedy has been provided in the event of a breach, i.e. the\n\ndefendant “waives his percentages.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 6. While the plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe non-interference clause does not state an “amount, percentage[,] or other formula”\n\nand does not state that the defendant owes the plaintiffs “anything in the event of a\n\nbreach,” Pls.’ Mem. I at 12, there is no requirement in the law that such clauses do so in\n\norder to qualify as a liquidated damages clause. Moreover, the non-interference clause\n\ndoes refer to percentages that the defendant would have received in the three cases if\n\nthere had been no breach of the settlement agreement. As a result, the non-interference\n\nclause was designed to act as a remedy to redress the types of breaches designated in the\n\nclause. Therefore, the non-interference clause is a liquidated damages clause, and the\n\nCourt must now determine whether the clause is enforceable.\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\f                        d.      Is the non-interference clause enforceable?\n\n        District of Columbia “jurisprudence has been tolerant of liquidated damages\n\nclauses unless they are demonstrated unreasonable.” S. Brooke Purll, Inc., 850 A.2d at\n\n1138. Thus, under District of Columbia law, contractual clauses providing for liquidated\n\ndamages in the event of a contractual breach are unenforceable only when the remedy\n\nprovided is deemed a penalty. See Dist. Cablevision Ltd. P’ship v. Bassin, 828 A.2d 714,\n\n724 (D.C. 2003) (holding that a liquidated damages clause specifying a single sum for all\n\ncontractual breaches that bore no “reasonable” relationship to actual damages was\n\nunenforceable as a penalty); Red Sage, 254 F.3d at 1126 (citing Davy v. Crawford, 147\n\nF.2d 574, 575 (D.C. Cir. 1945) (holding that while “parties to a contract may agree in\n\nadvance to a sum certain which shall be forfeited as liquidated damages for breach of the\n\ncontract,” if that “agreement is for a penalty it is void”)).\n\n        Courts examine a number of variables when assessing whether a particular\n\nliquidated damages clause amounts to a penalty. For instance, a liquidated damages\n\nclause will not be deemed a penalty if the contracting parties reasonably believed that\n\nany damages arising from the breach of the contract would be difficult to ascertain, and\n\nthus determined that such a provision was a “reasonable protection against uncertain\n\nfuture litigation.” Order of Am. Hellenic Educ. Progressive Ass’n v. Travel Consultants,\n\nInc., 367 A.2d 119, 126 (D.C. 1976); see also Red Sage, 254 F.3d at 1127 (citing Davy,\n\n147 F.2d at 575); Barnette v. Sayers, 289 F. 567, 570 (D.C. Cir. 1923) (“Uncertainty in\n\namount and difficulty of ascertainment of damages are regarded as supporting the view\n\nthat a contract provides for liquidated damages rather than a penalty . . . .”). Also, “[so]\n\nlong “as a liquidated sum bears a reasonable relation to the damages foreseeable at the\n\n                                              23\n\ftime of contracting the clause is enforceable.” S. Brooke Purll, Inc., 850 A.2d at 1138\n\n(internal brackets omitted) (quoting Christacos v. Blackie’s House of Beef, 583 A.2d\n\n191, 197 (D.C. 1990) (citing Burns v. Hanover Ins. Co., 454 A.2d 325, 327 (D.C.\n\n1982))); see also Ashcraft & Gerel v. Coady, 244 F.3d 948, 955 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (citing\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 356(1) (1981)) (explaining that damages may be\n\nliquidated in a contract “but only at an amount that is reasonable in [] light of the\n\nanticipated or actual loss caused by the breach . . . .”)); Davy, 147 F.2d at 575 (“damages\n\nstipulated in advance should not be more than those which at the time of execution of the\n\ncontract can be reasonably expected from its future breach . . . . ”). Further, if the\n\nliquidated damages clause was “the product of fair arm’s length bargaining, particularly\n\nbetween sophisticated parties, . . . [greater] latitude [is] afforded the contracting parties to\n\nargue as they wish on the remedies for a breach.” Dist. Cablevision, 828 A.2d at 723-24\n\n(citations omitted); Red Sage, 254 F.3d at 1129 (noting that under District of Columbia\n\nlaw, courts “are generally reluctant to disturb terms agreed upon by [sophisticated]\n\nparties”). Thus, if a liquidated damages clause bears no reasonable relation to\n\nforeseeable damages, does not serve as a reasonable protection against uncertain future\n\nlitigation, or “appears” to make the “default of the party against whom it runs more\n\nprofitable to the other party than performance would be,” then the clause “will be void as\n\na penalty.” Order of Am. Hellenic Educ. Progressive Ass’n, 367 A.2d at 126.\n\n        In Red Sage, the Circuit Court held the liquidated damages clause enforceable\n\nunder District of Columbia law, reasoning that at the time the parties signed the\n\nagreement they could have reasonably believed that damages arising from the breach\n\nwould be difficult to ascertain due to the fact that isolating lost sales caused entirely by a\n\n                                              24\n\fcompetitor is difficult to determine. 254 F.3d at 1127. Moreover, the court found that\n\nthe 50% rent abatement was not “plainly without reasonable relation to any probable\n\ndamage which may follow a breach.” Id. (quoting Davy, 147 F.2d at 575). The court\n\nreasoned that because “the rent abatement provision” encompassed “a wide variety of\n\ncompeting uses” that could constitute a breach, both parties could have reasonably\n\nanticipated that damages might be higher or lower than 50% of the monthly rent, and\n\ntherefore ultimately agreed upon a single formula intended to capture “a wide range of\n\npossible damages.” Red Sage, 254 F.3d at 1128. The Circuit Court determined that such\n\na design was not “unreasonable as a matter of law.” Id. The court also found that\n\nbecause of the uncertainty of potential future damages, “the provision [did] not guarantee\n\nRed Sage a certain windfall in case of a breach.” Id. Furthermore, because the contract\n\nwas negotiated by sophisticated parties, which the Circuit found “perhaps most\n\nimportant,” id. at 1129, it concluded that “the rent abatement provision in Red Sage’s\n\nlease [was] enforceable as a matter of law,” id. at 1130.\n\n       In Ashcraft & Gerel, 244 F.3d at 949, the plaintiff law firm sued a former\n\nemployee, an attorney, for a breach of his employment contract and sought damages\n\nunder the liquidated damages clause of the plaintiff’s employment contract, id. at 949,\n\nwhich totaled $400,000 at the time of the alleged breach, id. at 950. The court rejected\n\nthe defendant’s challenge to the reasonableness of the provision, in part because it was\n\n“triggered” only upon a “material” breach, and also because the amount recoverable\n\nunder the provision was not deemed unreasonable under District of Columbia law, given\n\nthe fact that it increased every year in conjunction with the defendant’s increasing value\n\nto the firm. Id. at 955. The court took note of the fact that the plaintiff was not “only the\n\n                                             25\n\fhead of the [firm’s] Boston office, but . . . he was [also] the only lawyer in that office\n\nwith substantial experience in the firm’s Boston practice areas[, and c]onsequently [] the\n\nfirm [could] reasonably argue that his termination for cause would likely be disruptive\n\nand create both considerable losses and expenses while the firm sought to replace him[,\n\nwhich] a firm partner [estimated would result in lost] business opportunities ... [of]\n\nbetween $1 million and $1.5 million.” See id. (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       In S. Brooke Purll, Inc., a contractor filed a counterclaim seeking liquidated\n\ndamages pursuant to a contract clause, which stated that in the event of a breach,\n\nliquidated damages would be 35% of the full contract price. 850 A.2d at 1136. In\n\nholding this liquidated damages provision enforceable, the District of Columbia Court of\n\nAppeals found that the percentage in the provision was not disproportionate to the actual\n\ndamages, which, according to the evidence, was within 1.67% to 10% of the contractor’s\n\nexpected profit. Id. at 1139.\n\n       Similarly, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held in Order of American\n\nHellenic that a liquidated damages provision was enforceable because of the difficulty in\n\ndetermining the amount of damages that would be sustained in the event of a breach, and\n\nthat the “reasonable estimate of the [plaintiff’s] net profit” approximated the minimum\n\nsum of $100,000 selected by the parties as the liquidated damages amount was close in\n\nvalue to what the actual damages may have been. 367 A.2d at 127.\n\n       All of the cases discussed above support the conclusion that the non-interference\n\nclause in the parties’ 2002 Settlement Agreement is an enforceable liquidated damages\n\nclause. Just as damages were too difficult to assess in Red Sage, S. Brooke Purll, Inc.,\n\n                                              26\n\fand Order of American Hellenic when the agreements in those cases were executed, the\n\nextent of the damages that would be occasioned by a breach resulting from the\n\ndefendant’s interference with the three then-pending class action lawsuits would have\n\nbeen difficult, if not impossible to assess when the settlement agreement was executed\n\nfor several reasons. First, before a settlement of those three lawsuits was attained, it\n\nwould have been entirely speculative to assume that any funds would be acquired, and if\n\nso, in what amount, as the fees the plaintiffs would have been awarded and the share the\n\ndefendant would receive hinged entirely on the outcome of the three unresolved\n\ncontingency fee cases. Second, as the non-interference clause itself recognized, the\n\nnature of any breach could occur in a number of different ways, e.g., any “attempt to\n\ninterfere with the pending cases or cases that follow,” any “attempt to file liens or notice\n\nof claims,” or “correspond with the litigants.” Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶5 & Ex. B\n\n(2002 Settlement Agreement). And, the nature of a breach could quite possibly have\n\nvarying degrees of impact on the settlement process and therefore the prospects of\n\nwhether settlements in the pending cases would occur, and if so, at what amounts.\n\nAssessing these variables before they occurred with any degree of accuracy would have\n\namounted to nothing more than a game of chance at best.\n\n       Additionally, the defendant’s loss of his percentage of the legal fees bore a\n\nreasonable relation to the potential damages the plaintiff could suffer as a result of a\n\nbreach caused by the defendant. If the defendant’s interference led to an unfavorable\n\noutcome in any of the pending cases, then obviously the plaintiffs would incur a\n\nmonetary loss, and considering the fees ultimately acquired by the plaintiffs in two of the\n\ncases–$3.85 million in the Gold Train case, id., Cuneo Aff. ¶ 7, and $2,190,982 in the\n\n                                             27\n\fLeatherman case, id. ¶¶ 11-12–it is evident that the damages the plaintiffs would\n\npotentially sustain could have far exceeded the amounts provided by the liquidated\n\ndamages provision. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Ashcraft & Gerel and\n\nOrder of American Hellenic concluded that the liquidated damages provisions in those\n\ncases provided reasonable estimations of the actual damages that would be incurred, and\n\nthe facts of this case provide no basis to depart from those rulings. Not only has the\n\ndefendant failed to make any showing that the liquidated damages provision did not\n\nfollow the guidance provided in Red Sage and the legal authority upon which it relied,\n\nbut his argument that the actual damages sustained by the plaintiffs was minimal, as\n\ncompared to the actual liquidated damages amount, is irrelevant. The fact remains that\n\nthe extent of the damages could not be reasonably calculated when the settlement\n\nagreement was executed and the plaintiffs were deprived of a material benefit they\n\nbargained for, causing them to expend more than $35,000 and considerable time\n\ndefending against and resolving the defendant’s interfering behavior.\n\n       Finally, while the defendant cites District Cablevision as support for his position\n\nthat the non-interference clause is unenforceable, the ruling in that case actually\n\nundermines his position. In District Cablevision, two consumers on behalf of a class of\n\ncable television subscribers brought an action against the District Cablevision Limited\n\nPartnership claiming they were charged excessive late payment fees of $5.00 each for\n\nfailure to make timely monthly payments for their television service. 828 A.2d at 717-\n\n18. The late fee was originally $2.00, but in 1990, District Cablevision “unilaterally”\n\nincreased the fee to $5.00 without any analysis or estimate to determine the actual\n\ndamages incurred as a result of customers failing to pay their bills on time. Id. at 718.\n\n                                             28\n\fRather, the increase was implemented “simply to ‘motivate’ subscribers to pay in a\n\ntimely fashion.” Id. On appeal, the court found that based on the evidence presented\n\nduring the trial, a jury could reasonably find that the “charge[s were] arbitrary, excessive,\n\n[and] designed . . . [to take] advantage of many thousands of individual customers,”\n\neffectively “ma[king] their cumulative defaults millions of dollars more profitable to\n\n[District Cablevision] than their timely performance would have been.” Id. at 725.\n\nMoreover, the increase having been unilaterally imposed by District Cablevision, the\n\ncourt found that it was not the product of fair arm’s length bargaining between\n\nsophisticated parties. Id. at 723-24. In contrast to what occurred in District Cablevision,\n\nhere, as lawyers and a law firm, the parties were sufficiently sophisticated to appreciate\n\nwhat they were agreeing to when the 2002 Settlement Agreement was executed, and the\n\nnon-interference clause of the settlement agreement was not unilaterally imposed by the\n\nplaintiffs, but rather was the product of negotiation between the parties. Thus, there can\n\nbe no claim by the defendant that the clause was the product of unfair bargaining.\n\nAccordingly, District Cablevision actually supports the conclusion that the non-\n\ninterference clause in the 2002 Settlement Agreement is an enforceable liquidated\n\ndamages provision.\n\n         B.        The Plaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss the Defendant’s Counterclaims\n\n         The defendant’s counterclaim asserts the following claims: legal malpractice\n\n(Count I)12, breach of the settlement agreement (Count II), quantum meruit (Count III),\n\n\n         12\n             In the defendant’s amended counterclaim he titles his “first cause of action” as a claim for\n“Breach of Obligations of Attorney to Client.” Am. Countercl. ¶ 30. However, in the parties subsequent\nfilings, they both refer to the claim as one for legal malpractice; therefore, the Court will take the liberty of\n                                                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                                       29\n\funjust enrichment (Count IV), unfair trade practices under the District of Columbia\n\nConsumer Protection Procedures Act (the “D.C. Consumer Act”)(Count V), intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress (Count VI), and conversion (Count VII). The plaintiffs’\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) motion seeks dismissal of all of these\n\nclaims.\n\n           A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests whether\n\na party asserting a claim has properly stated a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n\nWoodruff v. DiMario, 197 F.R.D. 191, 193 (D.D.C. 2000). For a counterclaim to survive\n\na Rule 12(b)(6) motion, it need only provide “a short and plain statement of the claim\n\nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and accords the\n\nopponent “fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds on which it rests,” Bell Atl.\n\nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citation omitted). “Although detailed\n\nfactual allegations are not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, to\n\nprovide the grounds of entitlement to relief, a [party asserting a claim] must furnish more\n\nthan labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of\n\naction.” Hinson ex rel N.H. v. Merritt Educational Ctr., 521 F. Supp. 2d 22, 27 (D.D.C.\n\n2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Or, as the\n\nSupreme Court more recently stated, “[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a [counterclaim]\n\nmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is\n\nplausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009)\n\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Furthermore, a claim is facially plausible “when [a\n\n\n12\n     (...continued)\ncontinuing to address the claim as both parties have.\n\n                                                        30\n\fparty asserting a claim] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw a reasonable\n\ninference that the [opposing parties are] liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. (quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556). Moreover, under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court “must treat the\n\n[counterclaim’s] factual allegations as true and must grant [the party asserting a claim]\n\nthe benefit of all reasonable inferences [that can be derived] from the facts alleged.”\n\nTrudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal quotation and citation\n\nomitted). Finally, factual challenges are not permitted under Rule 12(b)(6); instead, the\n\nCourt may only consider the factual allegations set forth in the [counterclaim], any\n\ndocuments attached as exhibits thereto (or incorporated therein), and matters subject to\n\njudicial notice in weighing the merits of the motion. EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier\n\nParochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The Court’s focus is therefore\n\nrestricted to the facts as alleged by the [party asserting a claim], which must be sufficient\n\n“to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the 2002 Settlement Agreement precludes the defendant\n\nfrom pursuing his counterclaims for legal malpractice (Count I), quantum meruit (Count\n\nIII), and unjust enrichment (Count IV). Pls.’ Mem. I at 14-16. The defendant responds,\n\narguing that the “[p]laintiffs’ breach of the settlement agreement reopens the underlying\n\nclaims.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 5. In addition, the plaintiffs assert that the defendant has\n\nfailed to state viable claims with regards to his unfair trade practices (Count V),\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI), Pls.’ Mem. I at 17-20, and\n\nconversion (Count VII) claims, Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and/or to Dismiss Defendant Joseph’s First\n\nAmended Counterclaim (“Pls.’ Mem. II”) at 5. The defendant counters this point by also\n\n                                             31\n\farguing stating that the plaintiffs “breach of the settlement agreement reopens the\n\nunderlying claims.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 5.13\n\n         The defendant submitted a copy of the 2002 Settlement Agreement with his\n\nVerified Answer, see Verified Answer, Exs. 1 (Exhibit A, 2002 Settlement Agreement)\n\n& 2 (Agreement of Release, 2002 Settlement Agreement),14 and he asserts a breach of\n\ncontract claim, which arises out of that agreement. Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 25, 37-42.\n\nTherefore, consideration of the 2002 Settlement Agreement for the purpose of addressing\n\nthe plaintiffs’ dismissal motion will not convert the motion into one for summary\n\njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). E.E.O.C., 117 F.3d at 624.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will consider the parties’ 2002 Settlement Agreement in\n\naddressing the plaintiffs’ Rule 12(b)(6) challenge.\n\n                  1.       Is the 2002 Settlement Agreement a bar to the defendant’s legal\n                           malpractice, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment claims?\n\n         The 2002 Settlement Agreement stems from a lawsuit the defendant in this action\n\nbrought in this Court against the plaintiffs in 2001 seeking compensation for work he\n\nperformed in the same three contingency fee cases while employed as a staff attorney,\n\nand later as a contract attorney, by the plaintiffs. In that lawsuit, the defendant asserted\n\nclaims for, inter alia, “breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and\n\npromissory estoppel. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. A (2001 Compl.) at 1. As noted\n\n\n\n         13\n           The defendant also asserts that his “claim regarding malpractice is not time barred as [he]\ncontinues to suffer harm.” Id. For the reasons expressed later, infra at 33 n.15, the Court need not address\nthe defendant’s statute of limitations argument because he is foreclosed from pursuing his malpractice\nclaim under the terms of the 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n         14\n           The Court has taken the liberty of assigning numbers to the defendant’s exhibits in his\nopposition memorandum and to the exhibits in his Verified Answer as he has failed to do so.\n\n                                                     32\n\fabove, in 2002, the parties reached an agreement settling those claims (the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement), and providing for the defendant to receive twenty percent of the\n\nnet fees the plaintiffs acquired in the three pending contingency fee cases. Further, the\n\ndefendant agreed to release all liens, not file any independent fee applications, not to\n\nmake contact with the litigants in the three pending cases, and to cooperate with the\n\nplaintiffs in the prosecution of the those cases. As the Court has already explained, the\n\ndefendant breached the parties’ settlement agreement, and moreover, as will be\n\nexplained later, infra at 38-39, the defendant, having first breached the settlement\n\nagreement, cannot maintain his breach of contract claim against the plaintiffs in this\n\naction.\n\n          Earlier, the Court noted that “[a]n agreement to settle a legal dispute is a contract.\n\nEach party agrees to extinguish those legal rights it sought to enforce through litigation\n\nin exchange for those rights secured by the contract.” Green v. Small, No. Civ.A.\n\n05-1055(ESH), 2006 WL 148740 *8 (D.D.C. Jan. 19, 2006) (quoting Village of\n\nKaktovik, 689 F.2d at 230). If a party breaches the settlement agreement, “the non-\n\nbreaching party may choose either to enforce the agreement or to rescind it and sue on\n\nthe original claims.” Hazel v. WMATA, Civ.A. No. 02-1375 (RWR), 2006 WL\n\n3623693 *9 (D.D.C. Dec. 4, 2006).\n\n          Here, when the defendant agreed to resolve his case by entering into the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement with the plaintiffs, he forfeited his legal right to a determination\n\non the merits of his legal malpractice, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment claims.15\n\n\n          15\n               Specifically, the defendant and the plaintiffs agreed to “make a full and final settlement and\n                                                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                                         33\n\fGreen, 2006 WL 148740 *8. In exchange, the defendant received the plaintiffs’ binding\n\npromise to pay him 20% of the net fees they received from the three pending\n\ncontingency fee cases referenced in the agreement, provided the defendant did not\n\nbreach the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Moreover, the 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\nclearly bars the defendant from bringing these claims. The plain language of the\n\nagreement states that: “[t]he parties intend to make a full and final settlement and release\n\nof any and all claims of any type whatsoever that they do or may have against each other\n\n. . . .” Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 4 & Ex. B (2002 Settlement Agreement). The\n\nagreement further states that “[t]he parties release each other of any and all claims of any\n\ntype whatsoever including but not limited to the civil action in the civil division of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia.” Id. Thus, the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement, by its own terms, precludes the Court from entertaining the\n\ndefendant’s legal malpractice, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment counterclaims.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the defendant’s position, nothing the plaintiffs have done merits a\n\ndifferent result.\n\n\n\n\n15\n     (...continued)\nrelease of any and all claims of any type whatsoever that they do or may have against each other and they\nacknowledge that there is good and valuable consideration for this Agreement.” Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff.,\nEx. B. (emphasis in original). Clearly, the claims being asserted in Counts I, III, and IV of the defendant’s\ncounterclaim arose out of events that occurred before the defendant initiated the lawsuit in 2001 and could\nhave been pursued in that action, as in fact two of the three Counts were. However, the defendant\nknowingly abandoned those claims and any other future claims he could have pursued in consideration for a\n20% interest in the net fees the plaintiffs acquired in the three pending contingency fee cases.\n\n                                                     34\n\f               2.     Has the defendant failed to allege a counterclaim of unfair trade\n                      practice pursuant to the District of Columbia Consumer Protection\n                      Procedures Act?\n\n       The defendant’s unfair trade practice claim is based on his theory that the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement’s non-interference clause is an unfair and improper trade practice\n\nunder the D.C. Consumer Act, D.C. Code § 28-3901 (2001). Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 60-62.\n\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant both advance arguments concerning their perspectives\n\nof what is a “trade practice” under the D.C. Consumer Act. The defendant argues that\n\nthe term must be interpreted broadly and when construed from this perspective “the\n\n[2002 Settlement Agreement] between [the plaintiffs] and [the defendant] was incidental\n\nto the supply of legal services to consumers and comes within the broad reach of the\n\nD.C. Consumer . . . Act.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 6. The plaintiffs respond that the defendant\n\nreads the term too broadly and that “[w]hile it may be true the [the plainitffs are] in the\n\nbusiness of providing consumer legal services, the dispute between [the parties,] which\n\nthe Settlement Agreement resolved[,] concerned the employment relation between [the\n\nparties] and only indirectly the provision of those legal services.” Pls.’ Reply I at 10.\n\nThe Court agrees with the plaintiff that the defendant has failed to state a claim under the\n\nD.C. Consumer Act.\n\n       The defendant’s theory is that the plaintiff’s action in attempting to enforce an\n\ninvalid liquidated damages clause is an unfair and improper trade practice under the\n\nD.C. Consumer Act. Am. Countercl. ¶ 62. Therefore, the defendant’s claim hinges on\n\nthe Court finding that the non-interference clause is invalid, a proposition that the Court\n\nhas already rejected. See supra Part III.A.3. Thus, the defendant’s claim must be\n\ndismissed.\n\n                                             35\n\f       Even in absence of the Court’s finding that the non-interference clause is an\n\nenforceable liquidated damages provision, the defendant’s counterclaim would\n\nnevertheless have to be dismissed because under the D.C. Consumer Act the term “trade\n\npractice” does not apply to the 2002 Settlement Agreement in any respect. The Act\n\ndefines “trade practice” as “any act which does or would create, alter, repair, furnish,\n\nmake available, provide information about, or, directly or indirectly, solicit or offer for\n\nor effectuate, a sale, lease or transfer, of consumer goods or services.” D.C. Code § 28-\n\n3901(6). The Act defines a “consumer” as “a person who does or would purchase . . . or\n\nreceive consumer goods or services . . . or a person who does or would provide the\n\neconomic demand for a trade practice[,]” and “as an adjective, ‘consumer’ describes\n\nanything, without exception, which is primarily for personal, household or family use[.]”\n\nId. § 28-3901(2). Finally, the Act defines “merchant” as “a person who in the ordinary\n\ncourse of business does or would supply the goods or services which are or would be the\n\nsubject matter of a trade practice.” Id. § 28-3901(3). Here, the defendant’s actions, in\n\nregards to the settlement agreement, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be\n\nconstrued as purchasing activity, but instead involved negotiations between attorneys\n\nand their subsequent execution of an agreement settling their dispute. As such, the\n\nplaintiffs’ participation in the process that brought about the settlement agreement did\n\nnot involve them in providing the defendant with any consumer services, and thus the\n\ndefendant’s claim falls outside the scope of a consumer-merchant relationship, which the\n\nD.C. Consumer Act regulates. See Ford v. Chartone, Inc., 908 A.2d 72, 81 (D.C. 2006)\n\n(stating that “the [D.C. Consumer Act] was designed to police trade practices arising\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\fonly out of consumer-merchant relationships”) (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       Finally, the defendant cites Banks v. District of Columbia Department of\n\nConsumer and Regulatory Affairs, 634 A.2d 433 (D.C. 1993), as support for the viability\n\nof his unfair trade practice claim; however, this case is distinguishable from Banks. In\n\nBanks, the court found that providing legal services was a trade practice within the\n\ndefinition of the Act. Id. at 437. However, in that case, the defendant provided legal\n\nadvice to an individual in no capacity other than that of someone purporting to be an\n\nattorney to a layman who sought and paid for legal advice. Id. at 435. As previously\n\nstated, the present case, by contrast, concerns a former employee of the plaintiffs who,\n\nfollowing the termination of his employment as an attorney, negotiated and executed a\n\nsettlement agreement with his former employer. Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot be\n\nsaid to have “ma[d]e available,” or “provide[d] information about, a service[]” that is\n\n“part[] of the economic output by society[,]” as the Court in Banks found had occurred\n\nin that case. Id. at 437.\n\n               3.      Should the defendant’s intentional infliction of emotional distress\n                       counterclaim be dismissed because he has failed to assert extreme\n                       and outrageous conduct by the plaintiffs?\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that the defendant’s intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress counterclaim should be dismissed because the defendant fails to provide a\n\n“description of the emotional distress supposedly suffered,” a description of the effect of\n\nthe distress upon him, and an explanation for how a “contract dispute involving payment\n\nof a sum of money in a business context” amounts to “outrageous” conduct that goes\n\n“beyond all possible bounds of decency[.]” Pls.’ Mem. I at 20. The defendant argues\n\n                                            37\n\fthat he has adequately asserted a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in\n\nhis counterclaim. Def.’s Opp’n I at 7. Specifically, he states that the plaintiffs “acted\n\nunreasonably and in bad faith in failing to pay the sum due as agreed in the settlement\n\nagreement,” id., and that this “conduct was truly outrageous and should not be justified\n\nin a civilized society” because they had “no valid argument for failing to pay [him],\n\nother than to punish him for recovering compensation from other lawyers for a case that\n\nhe created,” id. at 8.\n\n        An intentional infliction of emotional distress claim “requires a showing of (1)\n\nextreme and outrageous conduct on the part of the defendant which (2) intentionally or\n\nrecklessly (3) causes the plaintiff[, here the defendant,] severe emotional distress.”\n\nKhan v. Parsons Global Servs., Ltd., 521 F.3d 421, 428 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting\n\nDarrow v. Dillingham & Murphy, LLP., 902 A.2d 135, 139 (D.C. 2006)); see also\n\nKaseem v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 513 F.3d 251, 255 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The alleged conduct\n\nmust be “so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all\n\npossible bounds of decency.” Williams v. Fed. Nat’l Mortg. Ass’n, Civ.A. No. 05-\n\n1483(JDB), 2006 WL 1774252* 9 (D.D.C. June 26, 2006) (citing Duncan v. Children’s\n\nNat’l Med. Ctr., 702 A.2d 207, 211 (D.C. 1997)). The plaintiff may not merely state\n\n“labels and conclusions” in an attempt to meet the necessary standard. Grandison v.\n\nWaskenhut Servs., Inc., 514 F. Supp. 2d 12, 18 (D.D.C. 2007) (dismissing claim because\n\nthe plaintiff merely “allege[d], in conclusory fashion, that [the defendant’s] actions in\n\nterminating [the plaintiff] were ‘extreme and outrageous and willfully performed [and]\n\ncaused severe emotional distress to [the plaintiff]’”).\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\f       In Williams, the Court held that the complaint failed to state a claim for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, where the plaintiff alleged that the defendants\n\nhad “active[ly], conspiratorial[ly], malicious[ly], and secretive[ly] attempt[ed] to curtail\n\nor terminate [the plaintiff’s] prospective and ongoing business relationships.” 2006 WL\n\n1774252 *10. The complaint also stated that the defendants intended through their\n\nactions to damage “[the plaintiff’s] personal and business reputation,” by having\n\n“refused to contract with her because of her race and engaged in a campaign to prevent\n\nothers from doing business with her.” Id. Despite these allegations, the court found that\n\nthe defendants’ conduct failed to rise to the level required to satisfy a claim for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress. Id.\n\n       Furthermore, in Tiefenbacher v. AARP, No. 05-1802(CKK), 2006 WL 1126841\n\nat *1 (D.D.C. April 27, 2006), the court found that plaintiff’s allegations that her\n\nemployer humiliated her through demeaning and vulgar expletives, made obscene and\n\nsexually offensive statements, terminated plaintiff’s employment without providing her\n\nseverance or vacation pay, and escorted her from the premises like a common criminal\n\nwere, even if true, were not sufficient to support a finding of extreme and outrageous\n\nconduct, id. at *4. Likewise, in Duncan v. Children’s National Medical Center, 702\n\nA.2d 207 (D.C. 1997), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial\n\ncourt’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,\n\nwhere the plaintiff alleged that after becoming pregnant her employer “forc[ed] her to\n\ncontinue to either work in [a job position], where her fetus would be exposed to\n\nradiation, or to lose her job,” id. at 211, finding that the employer’s conduct was “not\n\n\n\n                                             39\n\fsufficiently ‘outrageous’ as a matter of law to sustain the cause of action . . . .,” id. at\n\n212.\n\n        In this case, the defendant’s counterclaim is based on his assertion that he was\n\ndenied the payment of money owed to him. None of the allegations presented in support\n\nof the defendant’s counterclaims even rise to the level of the defendants’ actions in\n\nTiefenbacher or Duncan, which the courts in both cases deemed insufficient to show\n\nextreme and outrageous conduct. Id. Further, as the court in Tiefenbacher noted, claims\n\nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress have been denied under even more severe\n\nfacts than were present in that case. See 2006 WL 1126841 at *4 (citing Kerrigan v.\n\nBritches of Georgetowne, Inc., 705 A.2d 624, 628 (D.C. 1997)).\n\n        Similar to the plaintiffs in the cases discussed above, the defendant has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that if his allegations are proven true, he is entitled to relief. Even assuming\n\nthe accuracy of his allegation that the plaintiffs intentionally, recklessly, and deliberately\n\n“depriv[ed the] defendant of his share of proceeds from the Leatherman case,” Am.\n\nCountercl. ¶ 65, not only was the withholding a justifiable response to the defendant’s\n\nbreach of the settlement agreement, but the plaintiffs’ conduct cannot be described, as a\n\nmatter of law, to have been extreme and outrageous to such a degree as to cause the\n\ndefendant severe emotional distress. See Williams, 2006 WL 1774252 at *10. In other\n\nwords, “[the plaintiff’s] alleged conduct is not atrocious and outside the bounds of\n\ncivilized society under District of Columbia law. In the commercial arena and\n\nelsewhere, it is commonplace that . . . contracts fail to materialize for [numerous]\n\nreasons,” and such conduct “does not rise to the level of outrageous behavior required to\n\nsupport a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.” Id. And this is\n\n                                              40\n\fespecially true here, where it was the defendant’s own conduct that precipitated the\n\nplaintiffs’ legitimate response about which the defendant is complaining. Accordingly,\n\nthe defendant has failed to allege facts sufficient to maintain his counterclaim for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.\n               4.      Should the defendant’s conversion counterclaim be dismissed for\n                       failure to state a claim?\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the defendant’s conversion counterclaim fails because\n\n“the failure to pay a sum of money pursuant to a contract, even if wrongful, does not\n\nconstitute a . . . conversion.” Pls.’ Mem. II at 5. The defendant contends that the\n\nplaintiffs unlawfully “exercised control, and continued to exercise control” of money\n\nthat is due to him pursuant to the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Defendant’s\n\nMemorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment and/or to Dismiss the\n\nFirst Amended Counterclaims and in Support of his Motion for Partial Summary\n\nJudgment (“Def.’s Mem. II”) at 3. Both parties rely on Curaflex Health Services, Inc. v.\n\nBruni, 877 F. Supp. 30 (D.D.C. 1995) and Government of Rwanda v. Rwanda Working\n\nGroup, 227 F. Supp. 2d 45 (D.D.C. 2002) to support their respective positions.\n\n       Conversion is “any unlawful exercise of ownership, dominion or control over the\n\npersonal property of another in denial or repudiation of his rights thereto.” Curaflex,\n\n877 F. Supp. at 32 (quoting Duggan v. Keto, 554 A.2d 1126, 1137 (D.C. 1989)). “One\n\nmay be liable for conversion to a person who is in possession of property or who has the\n\nright to immediate possession of the property.” Id. (citation omitted). To establish a\n\nclaim of conversion when money is the object of the claim, a plaintiff must have “the\n\nright to a specific identifiable fund of money.” Id. However, a claim for conversion of\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\fmoney may not be maintained to enforce a contractual obligation for payment of money.\n\nCalvetti v. Antcliff, 346 F. Supp. 2d 92, 106 (D.D.C 2004); see also Curaflex, 877 F.\n\nSupp. at 32 (citing Scherer v. Laborers’ Int’l Union of N. Am., 746 F. Supp. 73, 84\n\n(N.D. Fla. 1988) (rejecting the plaintiff’s conversion claim because her action was “for\n\nrecovery of an ordinary debt based on a [employment] contract”)).\n\n       In Curaflex, a contractual relationship existed between the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendants that required the plaintiff to provide products and services to the defendants’\n\npatients regardless of whether the patients paid the defendants. 877 F. Supp. at 31. The\n\ndefendants, in returned for the products and services, were obligated to pay the plaintiff\n\n70% of the revenues it billed for those goods and services. Id. at 33. The plaintiff\n\nargued that the defendant corporation was obligated under the parties’ contract “to\n\nsegregate from its general revenue all amounts it received for services [the plaintiff]\n\nrendered, to deposit the segregated funds into a separate designated lock box account\n\nand to transfer the lock box to [the plaintiff].” Id. at 32. The plaintiff was then to retain\n\n70% of the funds for itself and transfer the remaining funds to the defendant corporation.\n\nId. at 33. Based on this arrangement concerning the handling of the funds, the plaintiff\n\nalleged “that the [contract] clearly and unambiguously created in [the plaintiff] a\n\nproperty right to a specific and identifiable fund of money[,]” and that when the\n\ndefendant corporation failed to act in compliance with how the money for the plaintiff’s\n\nservices was to be handled and ultimately delivered to the plaintiff, “it converted [the\n\nplaintiff’s] property.” Id. The court rejected the plaintiff’s position, concluding that the\n\ndefendant’s failure to transfer the funds to the plaintiff was a breach of the contract\n\nbetween the parties, but not a conversion of those funds. Id. The court reached this\n\n                                             42\n\fconclusion because it found that “[w]hile the monies in the lock box were a specific,\n\nidentifiable fund,” the plaintiff had no “immediate right to possession or control of the\n\n[money,]” as its “ability to gain possession or control of the funds in the lock box was\n\nwholly contingent on [the defendant corporation] meeting its obligation [under the\n\ncontract] to instruct the bank [where the lock box was maintained] to transfer the funds\n\nfrom the lock box to [the plaintiff’s] . . . bank account.” Id. Therefore, the court found\n\nthat the plaintiff could not maintain its conversion claims “[a]s a matter of law.” Id.\n\n       In Rwanda, a contractual relationship also existed between the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendant, which required the plaintiff to pay the defendant a specific sum of money for\n\nwork that would then be performed on behalf of the plaintiff. 227 F. Supp. 2d at 50, 63.\n\nThe plaintiff paid the defendant $28,000 and $55,000 as specified in two separate\n\ncontracts, however, the defendant failed to use the funds in a manner that would benefit\n\nthe plaintiff as anticipated by the terms of the contracts. Id. The plaintiff therefore\n\ndemanded that the defendant return the money that was paid to him pursuant to the\n\ncontracts. Id. Because the defendant had received a specific identifiable sum of money\n\nfrom the plaintiffs, did not perform the services required by the contract, and did not\n\nreturn the money when requested to do so by the plaintiffs, the court held that the\n\ndefendant unlawfully converted the plaintiff’s money. Id.\n\n       The facts in this case more resemble those in Curaflex. First, when the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement was executed, there was no specified amount of money the\n\ndefendant was entitled to receive under the agreement, rather he was entitled to receive a\n\nspecific percentage of an unspecified sum based on the fees the plaintiffs might be\n\nawarded if the three cases covered by the settlement agreement settled. See Curaflex,\n\n                                             43\n\f877 F. Supp. at 32-33 (the amount of funds Curaflex would be entitled to receive would\n\nbe based on an unspecified sum of services paid by the defendants’ patients). Second,\n\nthe defendant had no ownership interest in, or even control or possession over the funds\n\nthat are the object of the dispute in this case. See id. (The funds were delivered to the\n\ndefendants and never made their way to the plaintiff). In Rwanda, by contrast, the\n\nmoney originated with the plaintiff, the plaintiff paid the funds to defendant, and then\n\nthe plaintiff demanded the return of the money because the defendant failed to do what\n\nhe was hired to do according to the terms of the parties’ two contracts. 227 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 62. Here, the money the defendant claims was diverted did not originate with him but\n\ncame, or would have come, from a third party. This Court is in total agreement with the\n\nconclusions reached by its colleagues in both Curaflex and Rwanda, as it is clear why on\n\nthe facts of those cases its colleagues ruled as they did. Finding remarkable similarities\n\nbetween the facts in this case and Curaflex, as compared to the distinct dissimilarities\n\nbetween the circumstances in Rwanda, the Court finds that the defendant cannot\n\nmaintain his conversion counterclaim. As the Court in Curaflex observed, 877 F. Supp.\n\nat 33, 35, what the defendant is asserting here is a claim for breach of contract, not\n\nconversion.\n\n         C.       The Defendant’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on his Breach of\n                  Contract claim.16\n\n         The defendant seeks partial summary judgment on his second counterclaim for\n\nthe plaintiffs’ alleged breach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Defendant’s Motion\n\n\n\n        16\n            The defendant also requested summary judgment on his conversion claim. The request is being\ndenied for the same reason the plaintiffs are entitled to dismissal on their Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n\n                                                  44\n\ffor Partial Summary Judgment at 1. Specifically, he argues that the “[p]laintiffs\n\nwillfully and maliciously breached the settlement agreement by failing to promptly pay\n\n[him] twenty percent of the amount received regarding the Leatherman case.” Am.\n\nCountercl. ¶ 38. The plaintiffs argue, on the other hand, that the defendant has “fail[ed]\n\nto demonstrate that he is entitled to summary judgment” because they “ha[ve] already\n\ndemonstrated that summary judgment should be granted in [their] favor” and the\n\ndefendant’s summary judgment request “concerns the identical issue.” Memorandum of\n\nPoints and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for a Partial Summary\n\nJudgment at 3. The Court agrees with the plaintiffs.\n\n       A party’s material breach of a settlement agreement generally excuses the other\n\nparty’s obligation to perform its end of the bargain under the agreement. Hazel, 2006\n\nWL 3623693 *9. Thus, under contract law, the party that first breaches the contract may\n\nnot recover for the subsequent failure of the other party to perform. Ashcraft & Gerel,\n\n244 F.3d at 952) (“[A] party to a contract may defend [a breach of contract claim] on the\n\nground that there existed . . . a legal excuse for non-performance . . .”); 14 Williston on\n\nContracts §43:5 (4th ed.) (“[T]he party first in default under a bilateral contract cannot\n\nrecover for the subsequent failure of the other party to perform.”); Restatement (Second)\n\nof Contracts § 237 (1981); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §241 cmt. e (1981) (“A\n\nmaterial failure of one party gives the other party the right to withhold further\n\nperformance”); see also Steel v. Isikoff, 130 F. Supp. 2d 23, 32 (D.D.C. 2000). Here,\n\nbecause the defendant materially breached the 2002 Settlement Agreement, see supra\n\nPart III.A.2., the plaintiffs were relieved of their duty to pay him 20% of the net fees\n\nthey acquired in the Leatherman and Kwikset cases, as would have been required by the\n\n                                            45\n\f2002 Settlement Agreement. This case is therefore distinguishable from those cases\n\nwhere the record raises questions as to whether an injured party was relieved of its\n\ncontractual duties when the other party had breached only some of its obligations. See\n\nManganaro Corp. v. HITT Contracting, Inc., 193 F. Supp. 2d 88, 98 (D.D.C. 2002)\n\n(stating that a party who has performed certain obligations under a contract may demand\n\nthat the other party honor the contract provided that the demanding party’s lack of\n\nperformance was not material to the contract. “The corollary is that if a party has\n\nmaterially breached the contract in a manner that goes to the very root of the contract, he\n\ncannot then terminate his performance and demand that the other party perform.”); see\n\nalso 14 Williston on Contracts § 43:6 (4th ed.) (“Material failure of performance under a\n\ncontract calling for an exchange of performances will suspend or discharge the other\n\nparty’s duty to perform”). Here, because defendant breached the non-interference clause\n\nof the 2002 Settlement Agreement, which was a material component of the settlement\n\nagreement, see supra Part III.A.2., the plaintiffs were no longer obligated to pay the\n\ndefendant based on the agreement. See Ferguson v. Caspar, 359 A.2d 17, 25 (D.C.\n\n1976) (affirming trial court and finding that “by [the appellants] own conduct, [they]\n\nprecluded their right to obtain specific performance of the contract” when they failed to\n\ncomply with a material obligation of the agreement).\n\n                                     IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the defendant materially\n\nbreached the 2002 Settlement Agreement, while on the other hand no breach of the\n\nagreement was committed by the plaintiffs. Therefore, the plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment on their claim for breach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement is\n\n                                            46\n\fGRANTED. In addition, the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, and\n\nVII of the defendant’s seven counterclaims is GRANTED. Finally, the defendant’s\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment on his breach of contract and conversion\n\ncounterclaims is DENIED.\n\n         SO ORDERED.17\n\n                                                                    REGGIE B.

The Relationship Between the Parties\n\n        The parties’ underlying relationship began in 2001 when the plaintiffs, a law firm\n\nand Mr. Cuneo, who “holds an interest in [the firm,]” initially employed the defendant as\n\none of the firm’s staff attorneys, Am.

I”) ¶ 2,3 and later as an\n\nindependent contractor, Pl.’s Mem. I, Affidavit of Jonathan W. Cuneo (“Cuneo Aff.”) ¶\n\n2. While employed by the plaintiffs, the defendant worked on “the preliminary stages”\n\nof three contingency fee cases, the Gold Train, Leatherman, and Kwikset cases. Pls.’\n\n\n\n        1\n            The facts set forth below are either admitted or are not in dispute.\n        2\n           The defendant combined his answer and counterclaim into his Verified Answer to the First\nAmended Complaint and Counterclaim (“Verified Answer”). The defendant later amended his\ncounterclaim in his First Amended Counterclaim without amending the Verified Answer. Therefore, when\nreferring to the defendant’s answer to the plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Declaratory Relief, the\nCourt will reference the defendant’s initial Verified Answer.\n        3\n          The plaintiffs filed their initial motion for summary judgment on March 27, 2008; however,\nbecause the defendant filed an amended counterclaim, the plaintiffs filed a new motion for summary\njudgment on June 11, 2008. Their new motion and supporting memorandum incorporate the original\narguments advanced in their initial motion and supporting memorandum without further reiteration.\nBecause the original arguments are incorporated in this manner, the court will have to reference both\nmemoranda in this opinion and distinguish them by referring to the first submission as “I” and the second\nsubmission as “II.”\n\n                                                        2\n\fMem. I, Cuneo Aff.” ¶ 2; Am. Compl. ¶ 20; Pls.’ Mem. I at 1. The relationship between\n\nthe plaintiffs and the defendant began to deteriorate for a variety of reasons and was\n\nultimately terminated when the defendant filed a lawsuit against the plaintiffs on August\n\n20, 2001 (the “2001 Lawsuit”). Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 3 & Exhibit (“Ex.”) A\n\n(Complaint, Joseph v. Cuneo Law Group, P.C., No. 1:01CV01755, Oct. 3, 2001) (“2001\n\nCompl.”). In the 2001 Lawsuit, the defendant alleged, inter alia, that the plaintiffs: (1)\n\nwere liable for breach of the employment contract between him and the law firm, and (2)\n\nthat the plaintiffs were guilty of unjust enrichment and conversion. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo\n\nAff. ¶ 3 & Ex. A, (“2001 Compl.”). Furthermore, the defendant demanded payment of\n\nany money that the plaintiffs owed him. Am. Compl. ¶ 15; Verified Answer ¶ 15. The\n\nplaintiffs refused to pay the funds being requested by the defendant because they had\n\nreceived a garnishment notice from the District of Columbia, which required that any\n\npayment owed to the defendant be delayed.4 Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13-14; Verified Answer ¶¶\n\n13-14. While the 2001 Lawsuit was in litigation, the defendant filed liens in the\n\nplaintiffs’ pending cases and contacted the plaintiffs’ various co-counsel in those cases.\n\nAm.

B (Agreement of Release) (the “2002 Settlement Agreement”).\n\n\n\n\n         4\n           The defendant objects to Cuneo’s reasoning for withholding payment, asserting that the plaintiffs\nwere holding “[t]he funds . . . in trust for payment of a health insurance policy for [the defendant] and his\nthree sons,” and therefore, according to the defendant, “had no right not to pay the insurance premium.”\nVerified Answer ¶ 14.\n\n                                                     3\n\f         B.       The 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\n         The 2002 Settlement Agreement “provided that [the defendant] was to receive 20\n\npercent (20%) of Cuneo’s net fees, if any, in three (3) then-pending plaintiffs’\n\ncontingency fee cases, referred to as the Gold Train Case, the Leatherman Case, and the\n\nKwikset Case.” Am. Compl. ¶ 20; Verified Answer ¶ 20. The parties included a non-\n\ninterference clause in the 2002 Settlement Agreement, which states that “[the defendant]\n\nshall make no attempt to interfere with the pending cases or cases that follow, nor shall\n\nhe attempt to file liens or notices of claims, or correspond with the litigants. If [the\n\ndefendant] does he has breached the agreement and waives his percentages.” Pls.’ Mem.\n\nI, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 5 & Ex. B (2002 Settlement Agreement). The defendant “also agreed in\n\nwriting to ‘release all liens’ and ‘not file any independent fee applications’ and to\n\n‘cooperate’ with [the plaintiffs] ‘reasonably in the prosecution of [the three pending\n\ncontingency fee] cases.’” Am. Compl. ¶ 22; Verified Answer ¶ 22.\n\n         C.       The Defendant’s Alleged Breach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\n         The plaintiffs allege that in January 2006, payment was received for the Gold\n\nTrain case,5 Am. Compl. ¶ 23, and from those funds the plaintiffs paid and the defendant\n\naccepted $240,895 in accordance with the 2002 Settlement Agreement.6 Pls.’ Mem. I,\n\n\n\n         5\n         The defendant states that he believes the plaintiffs received payment in the Gold Train case in\nDecember 2005. Verified Answer ¶ 23.\n         6\n            The defendant never disputes the amount that the plaintiffs assert was forwarded to him pursuant\nto the 20% he was entitled to receive under the terms of the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Furthermore, the\nplaintiffs “withheld $50,000 as a reserve to cover [expenses associated with the disbursement of the\nsettlement agreement], and paid [the defendant] 20% of [the plaintiffs’] fees after such amount was\nwithheld.” See Statement of Material Facts as to which there is No Genuine Issue in Support of Plaintiffs’\nOpposition to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to his Breach of Contract Claim ¶ 12.\nAccording to the defendant, he was told by an individual associated with the plaintiff law firm that he\nwould receive the withheld funds “within 90 days.” Verified Answer ¶ 24.\n\n                                                     4\n\fCuneo Aff. ¶ 7; Am. Compl. ¶ 24; Verified Answer ¶ 24. However, despite accepting\n\nthis payment and in disregard of the 2002 Settlement Agreement, the defendant contacted\n\nthe plaintiffs’ co-counsel in the Gold Train case, demanding an additional 20% “finders\n\nfee” for his work on that case. Am. Compl. ¶ 26; Verified Answer ¶ 26, 31; Pls.’ Mem. I,\n\nCuneo Aff. ¶ 8.7 Upon receipt of the defendant’s demand letter, the plaintiffs’ co-counsel\n\nin the Gold Train case notified the plaintiffs of the defendant’s demand, Pls.’ Mem. I at\n\n2; Cuneo Aff. ¶ 8 & Ex. E (Letter to the defendant from the plaintiffs’ counsel, Jan, 19,\n\n2006.), and the plaintiffs informed the defendant that his conduct constituted a material\n\nbreach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement, id. Then, on February 24, 2006, the defendant\n\nfiled a complaint against the plaintiffs’ co-counsel seeking one-third of their fees from\n\nthe Gold Train case. Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 9 & Ex. F (Complaint, Joseph v.\n\nDubbin, No. 06-20464, Feb. 24, 2006). On December 22, 2006, the case against the\n\nplaintiffs’ co-counsel was dismissed with prejudice, which Joseph appealed. Id., Cuneo\n\nAff. ¶ 9 & Ex. H (Docket, Joseph v. Dubbin, No. 06-20464). The parties to that lawsuit\n\nthen engaged in negotiations, which resulted in a settlement, and the case was dismissed\n\nwith prejudice on March 15, 2007. Id.\n\n         On February 12, 2008, the plaintiffs “received payment in the Leatherman Case.”\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 41. The plaintiffs promptly filed the present lawsuit claiming that the\n\ndefendant had “lost . . . entitlement to any share [of] the fee in the Leatherman Case” due\n\nto his prior interference in the Gold Train case. Id. ¶ 42. Consequently, pursuant to the\n\n\n         7\n            The plaintiffs contend that the amount the defendant initially demanded was for an additional\nfinders fee of 20 %, although the defendant does not explicitly admit that he demanded an amount equal to\n20%, he never disputes the plaintiffs’ contention as to the amount. Furthermore, the record reflects that he\ndid in fact demand an additional finders fee.\n\n                                                      5\n\fterms of the 2002 Settlement Agreement, the plaintiffs refused to release any of the\n\nproceeds from the Leatherman case to the defendant on the ground that he “waived his\n\nentitlement to a percentage of the Leatherman fee . . . .” Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶13.\n\n       D.      The Current Dispute\n\n       On February 15, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in this case, and\n\non February 26, 2008, they filed their amended complaint. After filing an initial answer\n\nand counterclaim on March 5, 2008, on May 22, 2008, the defendant filed an amended\n\ncounterclaim and answer asserting claims of legal malpractice; breach of the settlement\n\nagreement; quantum meruit; unjust enrichment; unfair trade practices under the District\n\nof Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act; intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress; and conversion. Am. Countercl. On June 11, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their\n\nmotion for summary judgment as to their request for declaratory judgement and their\n\nmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for motion for summary judgment on the\n\ndefendant’s counterclaim. The defendant then filed a memorandum on June 23, 2008, in\n\nopposition to the plaintiffs’ motions and also a separate cross-motion for partial summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                                     II. Legal Analysis\n\n       A.      The Plaintiffs’ Summary Judgment Motion\n\n       To grant a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56(c), this Court must find\n\nthat “the pleadings, the discovery, and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The Court must also view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Bayer v. U.S. Dept. of the\n\n                                             6\n\fTreasury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577670\"><a href=\"/opinion/577670/michael-d-bayer-v-united-states-department-of-the-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1992). However, the nonmoving party cannot\n\nrely on “mere allegations or denials . . . but . . . must set forth specific facts showing that\n\nthere [are] genuine issue[s] for trial.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248\n\n(1986) (citation omitted) (some alterations in original). Therefore, under Rule 56(c), if a\n\nparty fails to “establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on\n\nwhich that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,” summary judgment is warranted.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322 (1986). However, the party moving for\n\nsummary judgment bears the burden of establishing that there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the non-moving party’s case. Id. at 325.\n\n                1.      The Plaintiffs’ Breach of the Settlement Agreement Claim\n\n        The plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on their\n\nsettlement breach claim, arguing that the defendant materially breached the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement by interfering with the then-pending contingency fee cases, filing\n\na lawsuit against the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in one of those cases, and corresponding with\n\nthe litigants in that case, which violated the terms of the settlement agreement’s non-\n\ninterference clause. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44-45. The defendant responds that he did not\n\nmaterially breach the 2002 Settlement Agreement because he contacted only “co-\n\ncounsel” and not the actual parties. Verified Answer ¶¶ 2, 25-26, 31. He further asserts\n\nthat “even if he did [breach the agreement], the paragraph in question [in the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement] . . . constitute[s] an illegal liquidated damages clause and [is\n\ntherefore] invalid.” Verified Answer ¶¶ 2, 31, 42, 44. The Court’s first task is to\n\ndetermine what the parties intended when they executed the non-interference clause of\n\nthe 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n                                               7\n\f                            a.       The Terms of the Non-Interference Clause of the 2002\n                                     Settlement Agreement\n\n         The parties dispute the meaning of the terms litigants and pending contained in\n\nthe 2002 Settlement Agreement. The defendant contends the term “litigants” does not\n\ninclude lawyers and the term “pending” means a case that has not been “settled.”8\n\nDefendant’s Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment and the Motion to Dismiss\n\nthe Counterclaim and Statement of Points and Authorities in Support of the Motion for\n\nPartial Summary Judgment (“Def.’s Opp’n I”) at 3.9 On the contrary, the plaintiffs argue\n\nthat “the term ‘litigants’ was intended to include [both the] parties and their attorneys”\n\nbecause “[n]one of the defendants in the pending cases were natural persons[,]” as\n\n“[t]hey were the United States and two corporations,” and therefore, the only way the\n\ndefendant “could have corresponded with a party defendant would be through its\n\nattorney.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 10. Furthermore, the plaintiffs contend that the term\n\n“pending” includes all cases covered by the settlement agreement, even if a case was\n\n“administratively closed,”10 so long as the settlement remained outstanding and the case\n\n\n\n\n         8\n           Although the defendant never adopts the term administratively closed, it is the Court’s\nunderstanding that the defendant is asserting that once a case has been “settled” and is closed, it is no\nlonger in a pending status.\n         9\n            Like the plaintiffs, see supra at n.2, the defendant filed his initial memorandum opposing\nplaintiffs’ motion for dismissal or summary judgment on April 14, 2008. After the plaintiffs filed a new\nmotion for summary judgment or dismissal, the defendant filed a new memorandum in opposition to that\nmotion on June 23, 2008, incorporating the arguments made in his original memorandum without actually\nfurther reiterating them. The Court will therefore have to reference both memoranda and will distinguish\nthem by referring to the first submission as “I” and the second submission as “II.”\n         10\n             The case that was the subject of the settlement agreement was also assigned to the judge in this\ncase at the time of the settlement. Cases are administratively closed by this judge solely for statistical and\ncase management purposes. Cases in this status usually have been settled but remain under the Court’s\nsupervision and can be administratively opened in the event problems arise with the settlement and the\nCourt’s intervention becomes necessary.\n\n                                                       8\n\fwas still under the Court’s jurisdiction, which was the status of the case the parties had\n\nagreed to settle.

If he does he has breached the\n\nagreement and waives his percentages.” Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 4 & Ex. B (2002\n\nSettlement Agreement).\n\n         The plaintiffs’ argument that the parties intended the term “litigants” to also\n\ninclude the attorneys representing the parties is persuasive. The three lawsuits covered\n\nby the 2002 Settlement Agreement involved class action suits against the United States\n\nand two corporations. Plaintiffs’ Reply in Support of their Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment as to their Action for Declaratory Judgment and Motion to Dismiss and/or for\n\nSummary Judgment as to Defendant Joseph’s Counterclaims (“Pls.’ Reply I”) at 4.11\n\n\n         11\n            The Court notes that the plaintiffs assert that the three continency fee cases involved the United\nStates and two corporations, and the defendant never disputes this contention. Furthermore, the plaintiffs\ninclude a copy of the Final Order and Judgment in the Gold Train case, which illustrates that Gold Train\nwas in fact against the United States. See Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. C (Final Order and Judgment).\n\n                                                      10\n\fTherefore, the only plausible means of corresponding with the defendants would\n\nnecessarily have been through their attorneys. Consequently, a reasonable person in the\n\nposition of either the plaintiffs or the defendant, all of whom were attorneys, would have\n\nunderstood that the term litigants included the attorneys representing the parties. The\n\ndefendant’s assertion that the term litigants excluded the attorneys, absent any such\n\nexclusionary language, totally lacks credibility.\n\n       Additionally, the plaintiffs’ argument that the parties intended the term “pending\n\ncases” to include “administratively closed” cases covered by the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement while the settlement remained outstanding is equally persuasive. Pls.’ Mem.\n\nI at 10-11. The context in which the 2002 Settlement Agreement was executed is an\n\nimportant consideration. See C&E Servs., 498 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (stating that a court\n\nmust consider “the intent of the parties entering the agreement and whether a reasonable\n\nperson in the position of the parties, knowing the circumstances surrounding the\n\nagreement and the usages that either party knew or should have known, would find [the\n\nterm pending cases] reasonable.”) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Both parties\n\nwere aware of the cases that were covered by the agreement, Pl.’s Mem. I, Ex. B (Cuneo\n\nAff.) ¶ 7 (“The terms set forth in the attached exhibits are part of this release”) & Ex. A\n\n(listing “the Gold Train, Leatherman, and Kwikset cases as well as any directly related\n\nlitigation” as the cases covered by the settlement agreement), and there is no indication in\n\nthe agreement that some unspecified event would exempt any of these cases from the\n\nagreement’s coverage. Therefore, any reasonable person would interpret the term\n\npending cases to include all three cases until such time as the conditions of the settlement\n\nagreement were satisfied. The defendant’s efforts to inject non-existent limiting\n\n                                             11\n\flanguage, specifically that a case that has been settled and closed is no longer “pending,”\n\nDef’s Opp’n I at 3, into the agreement echo the efforts of the plaintiff in Howell ex rel.\n\nD.H. v. District of Columbia and must be rejected for the same reason here. See 522 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 57, 63 (D.D.C. 2007) (noting that “[t]he plaintiff bases her entire breach of\n\ncontract argument on language that simply does not appear in the settlement agreement . .\n\n. .”).\n\n         In Howell, the court rejected the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant breached a\n\nsettlement agreement. Id. While the settlement agreement itself did not include a\n\nspecific time frame during which the defendant would provide the agreed-to services, the\n\nnotes of the resolution meeting indicated that the defendant would require “at least 90\n\ndays” to provide the services. Id. The court stated that, “although the [language in the]\n\nsettlement agreement [] ma[de] no mention” or express limitation of the time frame\n\nduring which the defendant would provide the services, the court would accept the\n\n“settled usage” of the express terms that the parties memorialized in their meeting, not\n\nthe limiting language that the plaintiff alleged. Id. Therefore, the plaintiff could not\n\ninject her proposed limiting language into the agreement.\n\n         In this case, the defendant attempts to limit the meaning of the term pending cases\n\njust as the plaintiff in Howell attempted to impose an unexpressed limitation on the\n\nphrase “at least 90-days” in her settlement agreement to mean that after ninety days the\n\ndefendant was in breach. Id. The Howell Court rejected the plaintiff’s attempts to\n\n“torture” the agreement’s terms to benefit her reasoning and, instead, “honor[ed]” the\n\naccepted language of the terms of the contract. Id. This Court agrees with the court’s\n\nreasoning in Howell, concluding that the term pending cases, in the face of specific cases\n\n                                              12\n\fbeing expressly identified in the agreement, leaves no room for any interpretation other\n\nthan the parties were referring to the cases identified in the agreement, and that these\n\ncases would remain subject to the terms of the agreement until such time as the\n\nconditions of the agreement were satisfied. Therefore, the Court must “honor the\n\nintentions of the parties as reflected in the settled usage of the terms they accepted in the\n\ncontract . . . and will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning\n\nleaves not room for ambiguity.” Id. at 63 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted,\n\nemphases added).\n\n                       b.      Did the defendant’s actions constitute a material breach of\n                               the 2002 Settlement Agreement?\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the defendant materially breached the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement by “deliberately” interfering with the Gold Train case despite repeated\n\nwarnings by the plaintiffs. Pls.’ Mem. I at 10. The defendant contends that he did not\n\nbreach the 2002 Settlement Agreement, but that even if he did, “such breach was minor\n\nand did not substantially harm [the] plaintiff[s].” Am. Countercl. ¶ 40.\n\n       If the defendant engaged in conduct that constituted a material breach of the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement, conduct that “go[es] to the essence and frustrate[s] substantially\n\nthe purpose for which the contract was agreed to by the injured party,” then under the\n\nterms of the settlement agreement, he is not entitled to any payments provided by the\n\nagreement.

The Court may also consider the extent to which “the\n\ncontract has been performed at the time of the breach[,]” whether the breach was willful\n\nrather than “by negligence or by extraneous circumstances[,]” and whether “the breach\n\nwas quantitatively serious.” Greyhound, 595 F. Supp. at 1224 (internal citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Here, the question that must be answered is whether the defendant’s\n\ncommunication with the plaintiffs’ co-counsel went to the essence of the agreement, and\n\nthus, interfered with or substantially frustrated the purpose for which the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement was reached. The plaintiffs contend that the non-interference clause was\n\nadded to the 2002 Settlement Agreement due to the defendant’s “prior conduct,” which\n\nincluded filing liens in other cases in which the plaintiff law firm was involved as\n\ncounsel. Pls.’ Mem. I at 8. The defendant disputes the plaintiffs’ contention, but does\n\nnot offer an alternative argument as to why the parties agreed to include the non-\n\ninterference clause. Def.’s Opp’n I at 1. The Court finds that the plaintiffs’ position is\n\n\n                                             14\n\fthe only reasonable explanation for the inclusion of the clause in the absence of any other\n\nexplanation provided by the defendant. Moreover, the prior history between the parties\n\nalso supports the plaintiffs’ position, illustrated by the fact that in 2001 the plaintiffs took\n\nexception to the defendant’s behavior at that time, which consisted of the defendant filing\n\nliens and contacting the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in their pending cases. Am. Compl. ¶ 16.\n\nTo prevent the defendant from engaging in similar behavior, the parties entered into the\n\n2002 Settlement Agreement. See Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 5. These circumstances\n\nlogically support the plaintiffs’ position that the non-interference clause was included in\n\nthe settlement agreement because of the defendant’s behavior during the course of the\n\nprior lawsuit between the parties. As further support for the plaintiffs’ position, the last\n\nsentence in paragraph six of the 2002 Settlement Agreement makes it strikingly clear that\n\nthe non-interference requirement was essential to the continued validity of the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement. Pls.’ Mem. I at 6. Specifically, the language states that if the\n\ndefendant attempted to interfere with the pending cases, attempted to file liens or notices\n\nof claims, or corresponded with the litigants in the cases that were covered by the\n\nagreement, “he [will have] breached the [2002 Settlement] Agreement and waiv[ed] his\n\npercentages” of the fees agreed to in the agreement Id.\n\n        The plaintiffs assert that the defendant improperly interfered in the Gold Train\n\ncase, Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 9, when he deliberately contacted their co-counsel on\n\nseveral occasions despite the language of the 2002 Settlement Agreement prohibiting\n\nsuch behavior. As noted earlier, the defendant demanded a 20% fee from the plaintiffs’\n\nco-counsel in one of the three cases covered by the settlement agreement for work he\n\nperformed in that case even though he had already received $240,895 in accordance with\n\n                                              15\n\fthe settlement agreement. Pls.’ Mem. I at 2. The defendant was made aware by the\n\nplaintiffs that his actions were not in compliance with the 2002 Settlement Agreement,\n\nbut he nonetheless continued to communicate with the plaintiffs’ co-counsel,\n\ndisregarding multiple letters from the plaintiffs informing him that he was in material\n\nbreach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement by doing so. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. E.\n\n(Letter from the plaintiffs’ counsel to the defendant, Feb. 10, 2006.)\n\n       In America, the court found that the defendant breached a settlement agreement\n\nwhich contained a provision stating that “all inquiries [about the plaintiff] from\n\nprospective employers received by [the defendant’s agency] shall be referred to and\n\nhandled by the Agency’s Office of Human Resources.” 468 F. Supp. 2d at 123. The\n\ncourt found that the defendant breached the settlement agreement when two of the\n\ndefendant’s employees failed to refer calls inquiring about the plaintiff to the human\n\nresources department “as required by . . . the settlement agreement.” Id. at 124. The\n\ncourt noted that “the provision [at issue] requir[ed] an employee of the defendant to have\n\nno substantive communications with prospective employers, and to immediately forward\n\ncalls from such persons to its Human Resources Department.” Id. The Court further\n\npointed out that “[t]here [was] no question that [the employees] reasonably believed that\n\nthe caller [who was making an inquiry about the plaintiff] was in fact a prospective\n\nemployer and they still did not comply with that requirement.” Id. The court, therefore\n\nheld that the defendant had breached the settlement agreement.\n\n       Here, the settlement agreement contains express language forbidding the\n\ndefendant from “fil[ing] any independent fee applications, and [failing to] . . . cooperate\n\nwith the Cuneo Law Group reasonably in the prosecution of these cases,” or “mak[ing]\n\n                                             16\n\f[any] attempt to file liens or notices of claim, or correspond with the litigants,” Pls.’\n\nMem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. B, just as the settlement agreement in America prohibited the\n\ndefendant’s agency from failing to refer inquiries about the plaintiff to the agency’s\n\nhuman resources department. Moreover, whereas the defendant in America only had\n\n“reasonabl[e] belie[f]” that the defendant was in breach of the settlement agreement, 468\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 124, the plaintiffs in this case actually warned the defendant that he was\n\nbreaching the settlement agreement. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 8. Thus, the Court is\n\ncompelled to find that the defendant materially breached the 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n       The magnitude of the breach cannot be considered minor because the defendant’s\n\nconduct went further than simply communicating with litigants, as he subsequently filed\n\na claim against the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in the Gold Train case in the federal District\n\nCourt in Miami, suing not for just 20% as he previously demanded on January 10, 2006,\n\nfrom the plaintiffs’ co-counsel in that case, Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 8, but rather “1/3\n\nof their fees.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 2. And when the defendant filed suit against the plaintiffs’\n\nco-counsel, “[t]o avoid further interference and disruption to the Gold Train case,” the\n\nplaintiffs “agreed to indemnify [their] co-counsel against [the defendant’s] suit.\n\nStatement of Material Facts as to which there is No Genuine Issue in Support of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to His Breach of\n\nContract Counterclaim (“Pls.’ Stmt.”) ¶ 9. [However, the plaintiffs also] retained counsel\n\nto defend the suit in Miami[, and] Miami counsel succeeded twice in having [the\n\ndefendant’s] suit dismissed for failure to state a claim, the second time with prejudice.\n\nId. [The plaintiffs] ultimately paid a sum of money to settle the case on behalf of [their]\n\nco-counsel.” Id. As a result of the defendant pursuing the Miami litigation, the plaintiffs\n\n                                              17\n\fincurred “out-of-pocket costs, including the settlement, but excluding the time spent and\n\nthe plaintiffs’ overhead costs, were in excess of $35,000.” Id. And in addition to the\n\nplaintiffs’ monetary expenses, they expended nearly one year defending against the\n\nMiami case. Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo’s Aff. ¶ 9 & Ex. H (Docket, Joseph v. Dubbin, No.\n\n1:06-cv-20464). These expenditures of time and money were exactly what the plaintiffs\n\nsought to avoid through the execution of the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Nonetheless,\n\nthe defendant insists that the Court should disregard his actions, even if they amounted to\n\na breach of the settlement agreement, and focus on the extent of the harm he will suffer if\n\nthe Court enforces the 2002 Settlement Agreement’s forfeiture clause.\n\n       Although the defendant disagrees, Def.’s Opp’n I at 5, the extent of his loss\n\nresulting from the forfeiture provided in the settlement agreement is but one of eight\n\nfactors that the Court may consider when assessing the materiality of a breach. See\n\nAmerica, 468 F. Supp. 2d at 125 (delineating factors that a court is to consider when\n\ndetermining whether there has been a material breach of an agreement). Accordingly,\n\nwhile the defendant’s loss from the forfeiture would exceed $400,000, this factor alone\n\nis insufficient to defeat the plaintiffs’ forfeiture claims. See S. Brooke Purll, Inc. V.\n\nVailes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1139 (D.C. 2004) (rejecting the trial court’s determination that a\n\nforfeiture clause was an invalid penalty because it was completely disproportionate to the\n\ncontractor’s actual loss and instead finding that the “burden was on the owner”of the\n\nhouse being renovated to show that the clause was “disproportionate to the contractor’s\n\nanticipated damages in the event of a breach”)(emphasis added). This is particularly true\n\nin this case because any loss sustained by the defendant would have been occasioned by\n\nhis own conduct. As previously demonstrated, the defendant knowingly and deliberately\n\n                                              18\n\facted in a manner that was directly at odds with the non-interference clause of the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement. While courts will not enforce forfeiture provisions that constitute\n\na penalty, such provisions will be upheld where it is otherwise appropriate to do so, as the\n\nNeuffer v. Bakery & Confectionary Workers International Union of American case\n\ndemonstrates. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"258183\"><a href=\"/opinion/258183/hugo-neuffer-v-bakery-and-confectionery-workers-international-union-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671-73 (D.C. Cir. 1962). In Neuffer, a plaintiff\n\nunsuccessfully sought the resumption of pension payments from his union after violating\n\na provision under which individuals forfeited all benefits upon being found in violation\n\nof the Union’s constitution. Id. The court in Neuffer held that the plaintiff was not\n\nentitled to his pension because he had voluntarily brought himself within the terms of an\n\nexpress forfeiture clause, noting that while a trivial offense might not justify complete\n\nforfeiture, the plaintiff’s efforts to induce the Union’s members to join a rival union did\n\nnot qualify as trivial. Id. at 672-73. Similarly, in this case, the defendant’s anti-forfeiture\n\nargument fails because he voluntarily brought himself within the terms of the forfeiture\n\nclause and his non-compliant conduct was not trivial; in fact, it frustrated a critical\n\ncomponent and objective of the 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n       In addition, the defendant’s behavior was not a breach based on a mere\n\ntechnicality; rather, his behavior caused the plaintiffs to spend more than $35,000\n\ndefending against the Miami litigation, which took nearly a year to resolve. On this\n\nrecord, the Court can only conclude that the plaintiffs were deprived of a critical benefit\n\nfor which they had bargained when they entered into the settlement agreement with the\n\ndefendant and that the defendant’s actions therefore amounted to a material breach of the\n\n2002 Settlement Agreement.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f                       c.      Was the non-interference clause a liquidated damages\n                               provision?\n\n       The defendant relies on District Cablevision Ltd. Partnership v. Bassin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">714</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. 2003), for the proposition that “voiding [his] $460,000 fee [would]\n\nconsititute[] an illegal penalty” because the amount “bears no reasonable relationship to\n\nthe actual costs incurred by [the plaintiffs],” which he contends at most totaled\n\n“$12,500.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 5. The plaintiffs argue, on the other hand, that the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement is not an unlawful liquidated damages penalty because “[i]t states\n\nno amount, percentage, or other formula. It does not state that [the defendant] owes [the\n\nplaintiffs] anything in the event of a breach.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 12.\n\n       The defendant’s reliance on Bassin is misplaced. Bassin states, as the defendant\n\naccurately quotes in his opposition memorandum, that a penalty occurs:\n\n       when a contract specifies a single sum in damages for any and all breaches\n       even though it is apparent that all are not of the same gravity, the\n       specification is not a reasonable effort to estimate damages; and when in\n       addition the fixed sum greatly exceeds the actual damages likely to be\n       inflicted by a minor breach . . . 828 A.2d at 724 (citation and internal\n       quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, the 2002 Settlement Agreement does not specify a single sum in damages that\n\nthe plaintiff would receive if the agreement was breached; instead, the settlement\n\nagreement simply states that the defendant will forfeit his percentages if he does not\n\ncomply with paragraph six (the non-interference clause) of the 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement. In addition, as indicated above, the breach occasioned by the defendant’s\n\nconduct was not minor, but to the contrary was significant. Therefore, the Bassin\n\nproscription is not applicable to the facts presented in this case.\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       As previously noted, part of the 2002 Settlement Agreement states that “Joseph\n\nshall make no attempt to interfere with the pending cases or cases that follow, nor shall\n\nhe attempt to file liens or notices of claim, or correspond with the litigants. If he does he\n\nhas breached the agreement and waives his percentages.” Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex.\n\nB. In assessing whether a provision in a contract amounts to a liquidated damages\n\nclause, the Court’s first inquiry is whether the clause serves as a remedy for the breach of\n\nthe contract. See Red Sage Ltd. P’ship v. Despa Deutsche Sparkassen Immobilien-\n\nAnlage-Gasells-Chaft MBH, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185471\"><a href=\"/opinion/185471/red-sage-ltd-prtnshp-v-despa-deutsche/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1125 (D.C. Cir. 2001). To determine if a\n\ncontractual clause is a remedy, District of Columbia law requires that courts look to the\n\nwritten language of the contract which governs the dispute, “unless it is not susceptible of\n\na clear meaning.” Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In Red Sage, a District of Columbia restaurant sought a declaration from the\n\ncourt that its landlord breached an exclusive-use contract that was part of its lease. Id. at\n\n1122. The restaurant alleged that its landlord breached the agreement by leasing space to\n\na specialty cake shop in the same building. Id. Furthermore, the restaurant claimed that\n\nanother clause in the lease agreement reduced its monthly rent by 50% during the period\n\nwhile the competing-use business operated on the premises. Id. at 1123. Specifically,\n\nthe clause in question stated that “rent . . . shall be abated” by 50% if the landlord\n\nviolated his obligations under the contract. Id. Additionally, the contract stated that the\n\nrent abatement “shall not limit any other remedies which [the t]enant may have against\n\n[the l]andlord for violating its obligations under this Section.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\nWhile the restaurant claimed that this was not a liquidated damages clause, and was\n\ninstead a readjustment of its rent based on changed conditions, the court concluded that\n\n                                              21\n\fthe language created a liquidated damage clause because it indicated the parties’ intent to\n\nprovide a remedy in the event the lease was breached as a result of space in the building\n\nbeing leased to a competing business. Id. at 1125\n\n       As in Red Sage, the language used in this case in the 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\nindicates that the non-interference clause was intended to be a liquidated damages clause.\n\nTo reiterate, the clause reads, in part, that “Joseph shall make no attempt to interfere with\n\nthe pending cases or cases that follow, nor shall he attempt to file liens or notices of\n\nclaim, or correspond with the litigants. If he does he has breached the agreement and\n\nwaives his percentages.” See Pls.’ Mem. I at 6 (emphasis added) (citing 2002 Settlement\n\nAgreement ¶ 6). The clause in Red Sage used nearly identical language, such as use of\n\nthe terms “shall be” and “shall not.” 254 F.3d at 1125. The language in the settlement\n\nagreement indicates that a remedy has been provided in the event of a breach, i.e. the\n\ndefendant “waives his percentages.” Pls.’ Mem. I at 6. While the plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe non-interference clause does not state an “amount, percentage[,] or other formula”\n\nand does not state that the defendant owes the plaintiffs “anything in the event of a\n\nbreach,” Pls.’ Mem. I at 12, there is no requirement in the law that such clauses do so in\n\norder to qualify as a liquidated damages clause. Moreover, the non-interference clause\n\ndoes refer to percentages that the defendant would have received in the three cases if\n\nthere had been no breach of the settlement agreement. As a result, the non-interference\n\nclause was designed to act as a remedy to redress the types of breaches designated in the\n\nclause. Therefore, the non-interference clause is a liquidated damages clause, and the\n\nCourt must now determine whether the clause is enforceable.\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\f                        d.      Is the non-interference clause enforceable?\n\n        District of Columbia “jurisprudence has been tolerant of liquidated damages\n\nclauses unless they are demonstrated unreasonable.” S. Brooke Purll, Inc., 850 A.2d at\n\n1138. Thus, under District of Columbia law, contractual clauses providing for liquidated\n\ndamages in the event of a contractual breach are unenforceable only when the remedy\n\nprovided is deemed a penalty.

Cir. 2001) (citing\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 356(1) (1981)) (explaining that damages may be\n\nliquidated in a contract “but only at an amount that is reasonable in [] light of the\n\nanticipated or actual loss caused by the breach . . . .”)); Davy, 147 F.2d at 575 (“damages\n\nstipulated in advance should not be more than those which at the time of execution of the\n\ncontract can be reasonably expected from its future breach . . . . ”). Further, if the\n\nliquidated damages clause was “the product of fair arm’s length bargaining, particularly\n\nbetween sophisticated parties, . . . [greater] latitude [is] afforded the contracting parties to\n\nargue as they wish on the remedies for a breach.” Dist. Cablevision, 828 A.2d at 723-24\n\n(citations omitted); Red Sage, 254 F.3d at 1129 (noting that under District of Columbia\n\nlaw, courts “are generally reluctant to disturb terms agreed upon by [sophisticated]\n\nparties”). Thus, if a liquidated damages clause bears no reasonable relation to\n\nforeseeable damages, does not serve as a reasonable protection against uncertain future\n\nlitigation, or “appears” to make the “default of the party against whom it runs more\n\nprofitable to the other party than performance would be,” then the clause “will be void as\n\na penalty.” Order of Am. Hellenic Educ. Progressive Ass’n, 367 A.2d at 126.\n\n        In Red Sage, the Circuit Court held the liquidated damages clause enforceable\n\nunder District of Columbia law, reasoning that at the time the parties signed the\n\nagreement they could have reasonably believed that damages arising from the breach\n\nwould be difficult to ascertain due to the fact that isolating lost sales caused entirely by a\n\n                                              24\n\fcompetitor is difficult to determine. 254 F.3d at 1127. Moreover, the court found that\n\nthe 50% rent abatement was not “plainly without reasonable relation to any probable\n\ndamage which may follow a breach.” Id. (quoting Davy, 147 F.2d at 575). The court\n\nreasoned that because “the rent abatement provision” encompassed “a wide variety of\n\ncompeting uses” that could constitute a breach, both parties could have reasonably\n\nanticipated that damages might be higher or lower than 50% of the monthly rent, and\n\ntherefore ultimately agreed upon a single formula intended to capture “a wide range of\n\npossible damages.” Red Sage, 254 F.3d at 1128. The Circuit Court determined that such\n\na design was not “unreasonable as a matter of law.” Id. The court also found that\n\nbecause of the uncertainty of potential future damages, “the provision [did] not guarantee\n\nRed Sage a certain windfall in case of a breach.” Id. Furthermore, because the contract\n\nwas negotiated by sophisticated parties, which the Circuit found “perhaps most\n\nimportant,” id. at 1129, it concluded that “the rent abatement provision in Red Sage’s\n\nlease [was] enforceable as a matter of law,” id. at 1130.\n\n       In Ashcraft & Gerel, 244 F.3d at 949, the plaintiff law firm sued a former\n\nemployee, an attorney, for a breach of his employment contract and sought damages\n\nunder the liquidated damages clause of the plaintiff’s employment contract, id. at 949,\n\nwhich totaled $400,000 at the time of the alleged breach, id. at 950. The court rejected\n\nthe defendant’s challenge to the reasonableness of the provision, in part because it was\n\n“triggered” only upon a “material” breach, and also because the amount recoverable\n\nunder the provision was not deemed unreasonable under District of Columbia law, given\n\nthe fact that it increased every year in conjunction with the defendant’s increasing value\n\nto the firm. Id. at 955. The court took note of the fact that the plaintiff was not “only the\n\n                                             25\n\fhead of the [firm’s] Boston office, but . . . he was [also] the only lawyer in that office\n\nwith substantial experience in the firm’s Boston practice areas[, and c]onsequently [] the\n\nfirm [could] reasonably argue that his termination for cause would likely be disruptive\n\nand create both considerable losses and expenses while the firm sought to replace him[,\n\nwhich] a firm partner [estimated would result in lost] business opportunities ... [of]\n\nbetween $1 million and $1.5 million.” See id. (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       In S. Brooke Purll, Inc., a contractor filed a counterclaim seeking liquidated\n\ndamages pursuant to a contract clause, which stated that in the event of a breach,\n\nliquidated damages would be 35% of the full contract price. 850 A.2d at 1136. In\n\nholding this liquidated damages provision enforceable, the District of Columbia Court of\n\nAppeals found that the percentage in the provision was not disproportionate to the actual\n\ndamages, which, according to the evidence, was within 1.67% to 10% of the contractor’s\n\nexpected profit. Id. at 1139.\n\n       Similarly, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held in Order of American\n\nHellenic that a liquidated damages provision was enforceable because of the difficulty in\n\ndetermining the amount of damages that would be sustained in the event of a breach, and\n\nthat the “reasonable estimate of the [plaintiff’s] net profit” approximated the minimum\n\nsum of $100,000 selected by the parties as the liquidated damages amount was close in\n\nvalue to what the actual damages may have been. 367 A.2d at 127.\n\n       All of the cases discussed above support the conclusion that the non-interference\n\nclause in the parties’ 2002 Settlement Agreement is an enforceable liquidated damages\n\nclause. Just as damages were too difficult to assess in Red Sage, S. Brooke Purll, Inc.,\n\n                                              26\n\fand Order of American Hellenic when the agreements in those cases were executed, the\n\nextent of the damages that would be occasioned by a breach resulting from the\n\ndefendant’s interference with the three then-pending class action lawsuits would have\n\nbeen difficult, if not impossible to assess when the settlement agreement was executed\n\nfor several reasons. First, before a settlement of those three lawsuits was attained, it\n\nwould have been entirely speculative to assume that any funds would be acquired, and if\n\nso, in what amount, as the fees the plaintiffs would have been awarded and the share the\n\ndefendant would receive hinged entirely on the outcome of the three unresolved\n\ncontingency fee cases. Second, as the non-interference clause itself recognized, the\n\nnature of any breach could occur in a number of different ways, e.g., any “attempt to\n\ninterfere with the pending cases or cases that follow,” any “attempt to file liens or notice\n\nof claims,” or “correspond with the litigants.” Pl.’s Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶5 & Ex. B\n\n(2002 Settlement Agreement). And, the nature of a breach could quite possibly have\n\nvarying degrees of impact on the settlement process and therefore the prospects of\n\nwhether settlements in the pending cases would occur, and if so, at what amounts.\n\nAssessing these variables before they occurred with any degree of accuracy would have\n\namounted to nothing more than a game of chance at best.\n\n       Additionally, the defendant’s loss of his percentage of the legal fees bore a\n\nreasonable relation to the potential damages the plaintiff could suffer as a result of a\n\nbreach caused by the defendant. If the defendant’s interference led to an unfavorable\n\noutcome in any of the pending cases, then obviously the plaintiffs would incur a\n\nmonetary loss, and considering the fees ultimately acquired by the plaintiffs in two of the\n\ncases–$3.85 million in the Gold Train case, id., Cuneo Aff. ¶ 7, and $2,190,982 in the\n\n                                             27\n\fLeatherman case, id. ¶¶ 11-12–it is evident that the damages the plaintiffs would\n\npotentially sustain could have far exceeded the amounts provided by the liquidated\n\ndamages provision. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Ashcraft & Gerel and\n\nOrder of American Hellenic concluded that the liquidated damages provisions in those\n\ncases provided reasonable estimations of the actual damages that would be incurred, and\n\nthe facts of this case provide no basis to depart from those rulings. Not only has the\n\ndefendant failed to make any showing that the liquidated damages provision did not\n\nfollow the guidance provided in Red Sage and the legal authority upon which it relied,\n\nbut his argument that the actual damages sustained by the plaintiffs was minimal, as\n\ncompared to the actual liquidated damages amount, is irrelevant. The fact remains that\n\nthe extent of the damages could not be reasonably calculated when the settlement\n\nagreement was executed and the plaintiffs were deprived of a material benefit they\n\nbargained for, causing them to expend more than $35,000 and considerable time\n\ndefending against and resolving the defendant’s interfering behavior.\n\n       Finally, while the defendant cites District Cablevision as support for his position\n\nthat the non-interference clause is unenforceable, the ruling in that case actually\n\nundermines his position. In District Cablevision, two consumers on behalf of a class of\n\ncable television subscribers brought an action against the District Cablevision Limited\n\nPartnership claiming they were charged excessive late payment fees of $5.00 each for\n\nfailure to make timely monthly payments for their television service. 828 A.2d at 717-\n\n18. The late fee was originally $2.00, but in 1990, District Cablevision “unilaterally”\n\nincreased the fee to $5.00 without any analysis or estimate to determine the actual\n\ndamages incurred as a result of customers failing to pay their bills on time. Id. at 718.\n\n                                             28\n\fRather, the increase was implemented “simply to ‘motivate’ subscribers to pay in a\n\ntimely fashion.” Id. On appeal, the court found that based on the evidence presented\n\nduring the trial, a jury could reasonably find that the “charge[s were] arbitrary, excessive,\n\n[and] designed . . . [to take] advantage of many thousands of individual customers,”\n\neffectively “ma[king] their cumulative defaults millions of dollars more profitable to\n\n[District Cablevision] than their timely performance would have been.” Id. at 725.\n\nMoreover, the increase having been unilaterally imposed by District Cablevision, the\n\ncourt found that it was not the product of fair arm’s length bargaining between\n\nsophisticated parties. Id. at 723-24. In contrast to what occurred in District Cablevision,\n\nhere, as lawyers and a law firm, the parties were sufficiently sophisticated to appreciate\n\nwhat they were agreeing to when the 2002 Settlement Agreement was executed, and the\n\nnon-interference clause of the settlement agreement was not unilaterally imposed by the\n\nplaintiffs, but rather was the product of negotiation between the parties. Thus, there can\n\nbe no claim by the defendant that the clause was the product of unfair bargaining.\n\nAccordingly, District Cablevision actually supports the conclusion that the non-\n\ninterference clause in the 2002 Settlement Agreement is an enforceable liquidated\n\ndamages provision.\n\n         B.        The Plaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss the Defendant’s Counterclaims\n\n         The defendant’s counterclaim asserts the following claims: legal malpractice\n\n(Count I)12, breach of the settlement agreement (Count II), quantum meruit (Count III),\n\n\n         12\n             In the defendant’s amended counterclaim he titles his “first cause of action” as a claim for\n“Breach of Obligations of Attorney to Client.” Am. Countercl. ¶ 30. However, in the parties subsequent\nfilings, they both refer to the claim as one for legal malpractice; therefore, the Court will take the liberty of\n                                                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                                       29\n\funjust enrichment (Count IV), unfair trade practices under the District of Columbia\n\nConsumer Protection Procedures Act (the “D.C. Consumer Act”)(Count V), intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress (Count VI), and conversion (Count VII). The plaintiffs’\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) motion seeks dismissal of all of these\n\nclaims.\n\n           A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests whether\n\na party asserting a claim has properly stated a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n\nWoodruff v.

Furthermore, a claim is facially plausible “when [a\n\n\n12\n     (...continued)\ncontinuing to address the claim as both parties have.\n\n                                                        30\n\fparty asserting a claim] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw a reasonable\n\ninference that the [opposing parties are] liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. (quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556). Moreover, under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court “must treat the\n\n[counterclaim’s] factual allegations as true and must grant [the party asserting a claim]\n\nthe benefit of all reasonable inferences [that can be derived] from the facts alleged.”\n\nTrudeau v.

Finally, factual challenges are not permitted under Rule 12(b)(6); instead, the\n\nCourt may only consider the factual allegations set forth in the [counterclaim], any\n\ndocuments attached as exhibits thereto (or incorporated therein), and matters subject to\n\njudicial notice in weighing the merits of the motion.

Cir. 1997). The Court’s focus is therefore\n\nrestricted to the facts as alleged by the [party asserting a claim], which must be sufficient\n\n“to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the 2002 Settlement Agreement precludes the defendant\n\nfrom pursuing his counterclaims for legal malpractice (Count I), quantum meruit (Count\n\nIII), and unjust enrichment (Count IV). Pls.’ Mem. I at 14-16. The defendant responds,\n\narguing that the “[p]laintiffs’ breach of the settlement agreement reopens the underlying\n\nclaims.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 5. In addition, the plaintiffs assert that the defendant has\n\nfailed to state viable claims with regards to his unfair trade practices (Count V),\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI), Pls.’ Mem.

II”) at 5. The defendant counters this point by also\n\n                                             31\n\farguing stating that the plaintiffs “breach of the settlement agreement reopens the\n\nunderlying claims.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 5.13\n\n         The defendant submitted a copy of the 2002 Settlement Agreement with his\n\nVerified Answer, see Verified Answer, Exs. 1 (Exhibit A, 2002 Settlement Agreement)\n\n& 2 (Agreement of Release, 2002 Settlement Agreement),14 and he asserts a breach of\n\ncontract claim, which arises out of that agreement. Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 25, 37-42.\n\nTherefore, consideration of the 2002 Settlement Agreement for the purpose of addressing\n\nthe plaintiffs’ dismissal motion will not convert the motion into one for summary\n\njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). E.E.O.C., 117 F.3d at 624.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will consider the parties’ 2002 Settlement Agreement in\n\naddressing the plaintiffs’ Rule 12(b)(6) challenge.\n\n                  1.       Is the 2002 Settlement Agreement a bar to the defendant’s legal\n                           malpractice, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment claims?\n\n         The 2002 Settlement Agreement stems from a lawsuit the defendant in this action\n\nbrought in this Court against the plaintiffs in 2001 seeking compensation for work he\n\nperformed in the same three contingency fee cases while employed as a staff attorney,\n\nand later as a contract attorney, by the plaintiffs. In that lawsuit, the defendant asserted\n\nclaims for, inter alia, “breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and\n\npromissory estoppel. Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff., Ex. A (2001 Compl.) at 1. As noted\n\n\n\n         13\n           The defendant also asserts that his “claim regarding malpractice is not time barred as [he]\ncontinues to suffer harm.” Id. For the reasons expressed later, infra at 33 n.15, the Court need not address\nthe defendant’s statute of limitations argument because he is foreclosed from pursuing his malpractice\nclaim under the terms of the 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n         14\n           The Court has taken the liberty of assigning numbers to the defendant’s exhibits in his\nopposition memorandum and to the exhibits in his Verified Answer as he has failed to do so.\n\n                                                     32\n\fabove, in 2002, the parties reached an agreement settling those claims (the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement), and providing for the defendant to receive twenty percent of the\n\nnet fees the plaintiffs acquired in the three pending contingency fee cases. Further, the\n\ndefendant agreed to release all liens, not file any independent fee applications, not to\n\nmake contact with the litigants in the three pending cases, and to cooperate with the\n\nplaintiffs in the prosecution of the those cases. As the Court has already explained, the\n\ndefendant breached the parties’ settlement agreement, and moreover, as will be\n\nexplained later, infra at 38-39, the defendant, having first breached the settlement\n\nagreement, cannot maintain his breach of contract claim against the plaintiffs in this\n\naction.\n\n          Earlier, the Court noted that “[a]n agreement to settle a legal dispute is a contract.\n\nEach party agrees to extinguish those legal rights it sought to enforce through litigation\n\nin exchange for those rights secured by the contract.” Green v.

In exchange, the defendant received the plaintiffs’ binding\n\npromise to pay him 20% of the net fees they received from the three pending\n\ncontingency fee cases referenced in the agreement, provided the defendant did not\n\nbreach the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Moreover, the 2002 Settlement Agreement\n\nclearly bars the defendant from bringing these claims. The plain language of the\n\nagreement states that: “[t]he parties intend to make a full and final settlement and release\n\nof any and all claims of any type whatsoever that they do or may have against each other\n\n. . . .” Pls.’ Mem. I, Cuneo Aff. ¶ 4 & Ex. B (2002 Settlement Agreement). The\n\nagreement further states that “[t]he parties release each other of any and all claims of any\n\ntype whatsoever including but not limited to the civil action in the civil division of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia.” Id. Thus, the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement, by its own terms, precludes the Court from entertaining the\n\ndefendant’s legal malpractice, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment counterclaims.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the defendant’s position, nothing the plaintiffs have done merits a\n\ndifferent result.\n\n\n\n\n15\n     (...continued)\nrelease of any and all claims of any type whatsoever that they do or may have against each other and they\nacknowledge that there is good and valuable consideration for this Agreement.” Pls.’ Mem.

Clearly, the claims being asserted in Counts I, III, and IV of the defendant’s\ncounterclaim arose out of events that occurred before the defendant initiated the lawsuit in 2001 and could\nhave been pursued in that action, as in fact two of the three Counts were. However, the defendant\nknowingly abandoned those claims and any other future claims he could have pursued in consideration for a\n20% interest in the net fees the plaintiffs acquired in the three pending contingency fee cases.\n\n                                                     34\n\f               2.     Has the defendant failed to allege a counterclaim of unfair trade\n                      practice pursuant to the District of Columbia Consumer Protection\n                      Procedures Act?\n\n       The defendant’s unfair trade practice claim is based on his theory that the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement’s non-interference clause is an unfair and improper trade practice\n\nunder the D.C. Consumer Act, D.C. Code § 28-3901 (2001). Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 60-62.\n\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant both advance arguments concerning their perspectives\n\nof what is a “trade practice” under the D.C. Consumer Act. The defendant argues that\n\nthe term must be interpreted broadly and when construed from this perspective “the\n\n[2002 Settlement Agreement] between [the plaintiffs] and [the defendant] was incidental\n\nto the supply of legal services to consumers and comes within the broad reach of the\n\nD.C. Consumer . . . Act.” Def.’s Opp’n I at 6. The plaintiffs respond that the defendant\n\nreads the term too broadly and that “[w]hile it may be true the [the plainitffs are] in the\n\nbusiness of providing consumer legal services, the dispute between [the parties,] which\n\nthe Settlement Agreement resolved[,] concerned the employment relation between [the\n\nparties] and only indirectly the provision of those legal services.” Pls.’ Reply I at 10.\n\nThe Court agrees with the plaintiff that the defendant has failed to state a claim under the\n\nD.C. Consumer Act.\n\n       The defendant’s theory is that the plaintiff’s action in attempting to enforce an\n\ninvalid liquidated damages clause is an unfair and improper trade practice under the\n\nD.C. Consumer Act. Am. Countercl. ¶ 62. Therefore, the defendant’s claim hinges on\n\nthe Court finding that the non-interference clause is invalid, a proposition that the Court\n\nhas already rejected. See supra Part III.A.3. Thus, the defendant’s claim must be\n\ndismissed.\n\n                                             35\n\f       Even in absence of the Court’s finding that the non-interference clause is an\n\nenforceable liquidated damages provision, the defendant’s counterclaim would\n\nnevertheless have to be dismissed because under the D.C. Consumer Act the term “trade\n\npractice” does not apply to the 2002 Settlement Agreement in any respect. The Act\n\ndefines “trade practice” as “any act which does or would create, alter, repair, furnish,\n\nmake available, provide information about, or, directly or indirectly, solicit or offer for\n\nor effectuate, a sale, lease or transfer, of consumer goods or services.” D.C. Code § 28-\n\n3901(6). The Act defines a “consumer” as “a person who does or would purchase . . . or\n\nreceive consumer goods or services . . . or a person who does or would provide the\n\neconomic demand for a trade practice[,]” and “as an adjective, ‘consumer’ describes\n\nanything, without exception, which is primarily for personal, household or family use[.]”\n\nId. § 28-3901(2). Finally, the Act defines “merchant” as “a person who in the ordinary\n\ncourse of business does or would supply the goods or services which are or would be the\n\nsubject matter of a trade practice.” Id. § 28-3901(3). Here, the defendant’s actions, in\n\nregards to the settlement agreement, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be\n\nconstrued as purchasing activity, but instead involved negotiations between attorneys\n\nand their subsequent execution of an agreement settling their dispute. As such, the\n\nplaintiffs’ participation in the process that brought about the settlement agreement did\n\nnot involve them in providing the defendant with any consumer services, and thus the\n\ndefendant’s claim falls outside the scope of a consumer-merchant relationship, which the\n\nD.C. Consumer Act regulates. See Ford v.

Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot be\n\nsaid to have “ma[d]e available,” or “provide[d] information about, a service[]” that is\n\n“part[] of the economic output by society[,]” as the Court in Banks found had occurred\n\nin that case.

Def.’s Opp’n I at 7. Specifically, he states that the plaintiffs “acted\n\nunreasonably and in bad faith in failing to pay the sum due as agreed in the settlement\n\nagreement,” id., and that this “conduct was truly outrageous and should not be justified\n\nin a civilized society” because they had “no valid argument for failing to pay [him],\n\nother than to punish him for recovering compensation from other lawyers for a case that\n\nhe created,” id. at 8.\n\n        An intentional infliction of emotional distress claim “requires a showing of (1)\n\nextreme and outrageous conduct on the part of the defendant which (2) intentionally or\n\nrecklessly (3) causes the plaintiff[, here the defendant,] severe emotional distress.”\n\nKhan v.

Fla. 1988) (rejecting the plaintiff’s conversion claim because her action was “for\n\nrecovery of an ordinary debt based on a [employment] contract”)).\n\n       In Curaflex, a contractual relationship existed between the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendants that required the plaintiff to provide products and services to the defendants’\n\npatients regardless of whether the patients paid the defendants. 877 F. Supp. at 31. The\n\ndefendants, in returned for the products and services, were obligated to pay the plaintiff\n\n70% of the revenues it billed for those goods and services. Id. at 33. The plaintiff\n\nargued that the defendant corporation was obligated under the parties’ contract “to\n\nsegregate from its general revenue all amounts it received for services [the plaintiff]\n\nrendered, to deposit the segregated funds into a separate designated lock box account\n\nand to transfer the lock box to [the plaintiff].” Id. at 32. The plaintiff was then to retain\n\n70% of the funds for itself and transfer the remaining funds to the defendant corporation.\n\nId. at 33. Based on this arrangement concerning the handling of the funds, the plaintiff\n\nalleged “that the [contract] clearly and unambiguously created in [the plaintiff] a\n\nproperty right to a specific and identifiable fund of money[,]” and that when the\n\ndefendant corporation failed to act in compliance with how the money for the plaintiff’s\n\nservices was to be handled and ultimately delivered to the plaintiff, “it converted [the\n\nplaintiff’s] property.” Id. The court rejected the plaintiff’s position, concluding that the\n\ndefendant’s failure to transfer the funds to the plaintiff was a breach of the contract\n\nbetween the parties, but not a conversion of those funds. Id. The court reached this\n\n                                             42\n\fconclusion because it found that “[w]hile the monies in the lock box were a specific,\n\nidentifiable fund,” the plaintiff had no “immediate right to possession or control of the\n\n[money,]” as its “ability to gain possession or control of the funds in the lock box was\n\nwholly contingent on [the defendant corporation] meeting its obligation [under the\n\ncontract] to instruct the bank [where the lock box was maintained] to transfer the funds\n\nfrom the lock box to [the plaintiff’s] . . . bank account.” Id. Therefore, the court found\n\nthat the plaintiff could not maintain its conversion claims “[a]s a matter of law.” Id.\n\n       In Rwanda, a contractual relationship also existed between the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendant, which required the plaintiff to pay the defendant a specific sum of money for\n\nwork that would then be performed on behalf of the plaintiff. 227 F. Supp. 2d at 50, 63.\n\nThe plaintiff paid the defendant $28,000 and $55,000 as specified in two separate\n\ncontracts, however, the defendant failed to use the funds in a manner that would benefit\n\nthe plaintiff as anticipated by the terms of the contracts. Id. The plaintiff therefore\n\ndemanded that the defendant return the money that was paid to him pursuant to the\n\ncontracts. Id. Because the defendant had received a specific identifiable sum of money\n\nfrom the plaintiffs, did not perform the services required by the contract, and did not\n\nreturn the money when requested to do so by the plaintiffs, the court held that the\n\ndefendant unlawfully converted the plaintiff’s money. Id.\n\n       The facts in this case more resemble those in Curaflex. First, when the 2002\n\nSettlement Agreement was executed, there was no specified amount of money the\n\ndefendant was entitled to receive under the agreement, rather he was entitled to receive a\n\nspecific percentage of an unspecified sum based on the fees the plaintiffs might be\n\nawarded if the three cases covered by the settlement agreement settled. See Curaflex,\n\n                                             43\n\f877 F. Supp. at 32-33 (the amount of funds Curaflex would be entitled to receive would\n\nbe based on an unspecified sum of services paid by the defendants’ patients). Second,\n\nthe defendant had no ownership interest in, or even control or possession over the funds\n\nthat are the object of the dispute in this case. See id. (The funds were delivered to the\n\ndefendants and never made their way to the plaintiff). In Rwanda, by contrast, the\n\nmoney originated with the plaintiff, the plaintiff paid the funds to defendant, and then\n\nthe plaintiff demanded the return of the money because the defendant failed to do what\n\nhe was hired to do according to the terms of the parties’ two contracts. 227 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 62. Here, the money the defendant claims was diverted did not originate with him but\n\ncame, or would have come, from a third party. This Court is in total agreement with the\n\nconclusions reached by its colleagues in both Curaflex and Rwanda, as it is clear why on\n\nthe facts of those cases its colleagues ruled as they did. Finding remarkable similarities\n\nbetween the facts in this case and Curaflex, as compared to the distinct dissimilarities\n\nbetween the circumstances in Rwanda, the Court finds that the defendant cannot\n\nmaintain his conversion counterclaim. As the Court in Curaflex observed, 877 F. Supp.\n\nat 33, 35, what the defendant is asserting here is a claim for breach of contract, not\n\nconversion.\n\n         C.

Here,\n\nbecause the defendant materially breached the 2002 Settlement Agreement, see supra\n\nPart III.A.2., the plaintiffs were relieved of their duty to pay him 20% of the net fees\n\nthey acquired in the Leatherman and Kwikset cases, as would have been required by the\n\n                                            45\n\f2002 Settlement Agreement. This case is therefore distinguishable from those cases\n\nwhere the record raises questions as to whether an injured party was relieved of its\n\ncontractual duties when the other party had breached only some of its obligations.

HITT Contracting, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518402\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518402/manganaro-corp-v-hitt-contracting-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (D.D.C. 2002)\n\n(stating that a party who has performed certain obligations under a contract may demand\n\nthat the other party honor the contract provided that the demanding party’s lack of\n\nperformance was not material to the contract. “The corollary is that if a party has\n\nmaterially breached the contract in a manner that goes to the very root of the contract, he\n\ncannot then terminate his performance and demand that the other party perform.”); see\n\nalso 14 Williston on Contracts § 43:6 (4th ed.) (“Material failure of performance under a\n\ncontract calling for an exchange of performances will suspend or discharge the other\n\nparty’s duty to perform”). Here, because defendant breached the non-interference clause\n\nof the 2002 Settlement Agreement, which was a material component of the settlement\n\nagreement, see supra Part III.A.2., the plaintiffs were no longer obligated to pay the\n\ndefendant based on the agreement. See Ferguson v. Caspar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (D.C.\n\n1976) (affirming trial court and finding that “by [the appellants] own conduct, [they]\n\nprecluded their right to obtain specific performance of the contract” when they failed to\n\ncomply with a material obligation of the agreement).\n\n                                     IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the defendant materially\n\nbreached the 2002 Settlement Agreement, while on the other hand no breach of the\n\nagreement was committed by the plaintiffs. Therefore, the plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment on their claim for breach of the 2002 Settlement Agreement is\n\n                                            46\n\fGRANTED. In addition, the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Counts I, III, IV, V, VI, and\n\nVII of the defendant’s seven counterclaims is GRANTED. Finally, the defendant’s\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment on his breach of contract and conversion\n\ncounterclaims is DENIED.\n\n         SO ORDERED.17\n\n                                                                    REGGIE B.
