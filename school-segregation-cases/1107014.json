(US Airways),\nappeals the district court’s dismissal of Oakey’s claim under\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29\n\f                                2\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1001 et seq., seeking benefits from a collectively-\nbargained pilot disability plan. We conclude that section 204\nof the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq.,\nvests in the “applicable adjustment board” exclusive\njurisdiction over Oakey’s claim because it is grounded in the\napplication and interpretation of a collective bargaining\nagreement. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal for lack of\njurisdiction.\n                                I.\n                   A. Statutory Background\n     ERISA is a “comprehensive statute designed to promote\nthe interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee\nbenefit plans” and “to provide a uniform regulatory regime\nover employee benefit plans.” Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,\n463 U.S. 85, 90 (1983); Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S.\n200, 208 (2004). ERISA requires notice of the denial of an\nemployee disability claim, “ ‘setting forth the specific reasons\nfor such denial, written in a manner calculated to be\nunderstood by the participant,’ ” and a reasonable opportunity\nfor a “ ‘a full and fair review’ ” of the denial. Heller v. Fortis\nBenefits Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 487, 492 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting\n29 U.S.C. § 1133). ERISA also grants a disability claimant\nthe right to “sue ‘to recover benefits due to him under the\nterms of his plan.’ ” Fitts v. Fed. Nat’l. Mortg. Ass’n, 236\nF.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(a)(1)(B)). Its “comprehensive legislative scheme”\nincludes “an integrated system of procedures for\nenforcement” that the Congress intended to be “exclusive”\nand to preempt “any state-law cause of action that duplicates,\nsupplements, or supplants the ERISA civil enforcement\nremedy.” Davila, 542 U.S. at 208-09 (quotation marks\nomitted); see 29 U.S.C. § 1144. Exclusive jurisdiction over\nan ERISA-based claim lies in federal district court. Bd. of\nTrustees of Hotel & Rest. Emps. Local 25 v. Madison Hotel,\n\f                               3\n\nInc., 97 F.3d 1479, 1483-84 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citing 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1132(e)(1)).\n     The more narrowly focused RLA was initially limited to\nthe railroad industry but has been applied to disputes between\nair carriers and their employees since 1936. Air Line Pilots\nAss’n, Int’l v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 863 F.2d 87, 88 (D.C.\nCir. 1988) (citing 45 U.S.C. § 181 (1982)); see also Int’l\nAss’n of Machinists v. Cent. Airlines, Inc., 372 U.S. 682,\n685-86 (1963)). It was enacted “to promote stability in\nlabor-management relations by providing a comprehensive\nframework for resolving labor disputes.” Hawaiian Airlines,\nInc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 252 (1994). Under section 204\nof the RLA, such disputes “growing out of grievances, or out\nof the interpretation or application of agreements concerning\nrates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . may be referred\nby petition of the parties or by either party to an appropriate\nadjustment board.” 45 U.S.C. § 184. Each air carrier has a\nduty “to establish a board of adjustment,” id., and the\nstatutory grievance procedure is “ ‘mandatory, exclusive, and\ncomprehensive,’ ” Delta Airlines, 863 F.2d at 88 (quoting\nBhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co.,\n373 U.S. 33, 38 (1963)). Judicial review of the board of\nadjustment’s decision is limited to three categories expressly\nset out in the RLA. Id. (citing Union Pac. R.R. v. Sheehan,\n439 U.S. 89, 93 (1978); 45 U.S.C. § 153 First (p)).\n                   B. Factual Background\n     Oakey was employed as an airline pilot by US Airways\nfrom 1988 to 2002 and was enrolled in the US Airways Pilot\nDisability Plan (Plan), which initially took effect on January\n1, 1975—the effective date of ERISA—as the result of\ncollective bargaining between US Airways’ predecessor\n(Allegheny Airlines) and the Air Line Pilots Association\n(ALPA).      The original Plan agreement contained the\nfollowing provision governing the term of its coverage: “Each\n\f                               4\n\npilot will become covered for benefits on the date he is\nemployed and is classified as being in active service. If a\npilot becomes classified as being other than in active service,\nhe will no longer be covered as of the date of such change in\nemployment status.” Allegheny Airlines Pilot’s Long Term\nDisability & Loss of License Plan (1975 Disability Plan) art.\n5.1 (Jan. 1, 1975) (JA 593). The 1975 Disability Plan does\nnot define “active service” or address the effect of a pilot’s\nfurlough status on benefits eligibility. In 1997, however, US\nAirways produced an “amended and restated” version of the\nplan. USAir, Inc. Pilot Disability Plan (effective Feb. 18,\n1997) (1997 Amendment) (JA 63). The 1997 Amendment is\nsigned by a US Airways officer but not by an ALPA\nrepresentative. Id. at 18-19. It defines “active service” as\n“those periods during which the Employee is in active payroll\nstatus with the Employer,” id. art. 1.2, and specifically\nprovides that “[b]enefits payable [t]hereunder shall cease\nupon . . . the date the Participant is placed on furlough status\nfrom the Employer,” id. art. 3.6.\n     Under both the 1975 Disability Plan and the 1997\nAmendment, benefit claims are reviewed and decided by the\nUS Airways Retirement Board, see also Letter of Agreement\nBetween US Air, Inc. and the airline Pilots re: RETIREMENT\nBOARD (JA 558) § 1.6. (Feb. 9, 1990). The Retirement\nBoard consists of four members—two selected by US\nAirways and two by ALPA. A decision by agreement of three\nor more Retirement Board members is “final and binding.”\nId. Absent such agreement, an “Impartial Referee” is\ndesignated to sit as a fifth member of the Retirement Board\nand a subsequent decision by three or more members is then\n“final and binding upon all parties.” Id. § 2.1.\n    In 2001, after he was diagnosed with leukemia, Oakey\nsubmitted a claim for disability benefits to the Retirement\nBoard, which approved the claim effective January 30, 2002.\n\f                              5\n\nThe following January, US Airways notified Oakey he was to\nbe “furloughed” effective February 4, 2003 as part of a fleet\nreduction. Letter of US Airways to Michael S. Oakey (Jan. 9,\n2003) (JA 441). On March 11, 2003, the Administrator of the\nPlan (Administrator) advised Oakey that, based on his\nfurlough date, his disability benefits had terminated on\nFebruary 4, 2003.\n     Oakey subsequently requested, through legal counsel,\nthat the Administrator provide a “copy of the disability\npolicy.” Letter from Bruce E. Woodske to ING at 1 (Mar. 25,\n2003) (JA 175). Oakey’s counsel was referred to US\nAirways, which transmitted a copy of Article 3.6 of the 1997\nAmendment stating, to repeat, that disability benefits cease on\nthe date a participant is “placed on furlough status.”\nFacsimile from US AIRWAYS to Bruce E. Woodske (Apr. 1,\n2003) (JA 182). Oakey’s counsel subsequently requested “the\nentire benefits plan with all amendments to the present.”\nFacsimile from Bruce E. Woodske to US Airways (Apr. 21,\n2003) (JA 190). Nonetheless, Oakey “never received a copy\nof the Disability Plan from US Airways, despite the\nrequirement of ERISA § 104(b)(4), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(b)(4),\nthat such plan documents be provided promptly upon\nrequest.” Second Am. Compl. (Compl.) ¶ 27. In August\n2003, Oakey took early (and reduced) retirement.\n     In November 2003, Oakey and six other retired US\nAirways pilots filed an action under ERISA against, inter alia,\nUS Airways and the Plan for benefits allegedly owed. On\nOctober 21, 2011, Oakey, the only remaining plaintiff, filed a\n“Second Amended Complaint” (Complaint) against the Plan,\nthe only remaining defendant, alleging a single claim for\nunpaid benefits resulting from the wrongful termination of his\ndisability benefits in February 2003. The Complaint asserts\nthat the 1997 Amendment was ineffective because it was not\nsigned by an ALPA representative, Compl. ¶¶ 7-10, and that\n\f                                6\n\nOakey’s disability coverage was therefore governed by the\n1975 Disability Plan, which does not terminate benefits upon\nan employee’s furlough. Compl. ¶¶ 10, 40-42.\n     On December 12, 2011, the Plan moved under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction on the ground that the RLA’s mandatory\narbitration provision deprived the district court of jurisdiction.\nOn March 19, 2012, the district court granted the Plan’s\nmotion and dismissed the action. Oakey v. U.S. Airways\nPilots Disability Income Plan, 839 F. Supp. 2d 225 (D.D.C.\n2012). Oakey timely appealed.\n                               II.\n    We review de novo the district court’s grant of a motion\nto dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Nat’l Air\nTraffic Controllers Ass’n v. Fed. Serv. Impasses Panel, 606\nF.3d 780, 786 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quotation marks omitted).\nFor the reasons set out below, we agree with the district\ncourt’s Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal.\n     In Air Line Pilots Association, International v. Northwest\nAirlines, Inc., 627 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1980), we first\naddressed the interplay between the RLA and ERISA and\nconcluded that the latter (and later-enacted)\nstatute—notwithstanding its broad preemption of state law\nremedies—has no preemptive effect on other federal\nenactments—including the RLA. As we noted in Northwest,\nthe Congress “made its will very clear” on this point when it\ndeclared in section 514(d) of ERISA:\n         “Nothing in this title [] shall be construed to\n    alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede\n    any law of the United States (except as provided in\n    sections 1031 and 1137(b) of this title) or any rule or\n    regulation issued under any such law.”\n\f                               7\n\n627 F.2d at 275 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1144(d) (alterations in\noriginal)).    Given the “strong, comprehensive, express\nstatement that ERISA is not to be read as displacing by\nimplication any pre-existing federal legislation,” the\nNorthwest court concluded that ERISA has no effect on RLA\nsection 204’s “mandate[ that] the carrier or the union [] refer\ndisputes over the application or interpretation of bargaining\nagreements covering [rates of pay, rules, or working\nconditions’ terms including employee pensions], if they\ncannot be resolved informally, to arbitration.” Id. at 275-76\n(quoting 45 U.S.C. § 184 (emphasis added)). In Northwest,\nwe emphasized that referral to the board of adjustment for\narbitration “is a compulsory statutory obligation.” Id. at 275.\nThus, referral to the Retirement Board is compulsory for\nOakey because the dispute is plainly “over the application or\ninterpretation” of the Plan, which controls the outcome\nwhether the 1975 or the 1997 version governs. Accordingly,\nunder Northwest, exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute lies\nwith the Retirement Board and the district court correctly\ndismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. Nonetheless,\nOakey challenges the district court’s dismissal on three\ngrounds.\n            A. Continuing Vitality of Northwest\n     First, Oakey asserts that Northwest is no longer good law\nand that we should overrule it through an “Irons footnote.” It\nis true that, in a case “in which action by the court en banc\nmay be called for, but the circumstances of the case or the\nimportance of the legal questions presented do not warrant the\nheavy administrative burdens of full en banc hearing,” a panel\nof the court may use an “Irons footnote” to “overrul[e] a . . .\nprecedent which, due to an intervening Supreme Court\ndecision, or the combined weight of authority from other\ncircuits, a panel is convinced is clearly an incorrect statement\nof current law.” Policy Statement on En Banc Endorsement\n\f                                  8\n\nof Panel Decisions (Irons Footnote Policy) at 1 (Jan. 17,\n1996).1 But we are not the least convinced intervening\ncaselaw has vitiated Northwest’s rationale.\n     Oakey contends that Northwest is inconsistent with the\nUnited States Supreme Court’s holding in Atchison, Topeka &\nSanta Fe Ry. Co. v. Buell, 480 U.S. 557 (1987), which he\ncharacterizes as “highly suggestive that the RLA does not\npreclude ERISA claims.” Appellant’s Br. 35. We disagree.\nIn Buell, the Court concluded that the RLA did not preclude\nthe plaintiff’s negligence claim against his employer under the\nFederal Employers’ Liability Act, which “provides railroad\nworkers with substantive protection against negligent conduct\nthat is independent of the employer’s obligations under its\ncollective-bargaining agreement [and] also affords injured\nworkers a remedy suited to their needs.” 480 U.S. at 565\n(emphasis added). In so holding, however, the Buell Court\nconfirmed its decision in Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville\nR.R. Co., 406 U.S. 320, 325 (1972), that for a “claim based\nsquarely on an alleged breach of the collective-bargaining\nagreement,” the Congress “intended the RLA dispute\nresolution mechanism to be mandatory” and “courts were\ntherefore foreclosed from addressing claims that properly\narise under the RLA.” Buell, 480 U.S. at 566. In Northwest,\nwe recognized the same distinction between a claim involving\n“the application and interpretation of the pension plan,” for\nwhich arbitration was compulsory under the RLA, and those\nclaims stating “violations of ERISA which are independent of\nthe coverage and meaning of the pension plan,” noting that\nthe latter may be litigated in court. Northwest, 627 F.2d at\n\n  1\n    In an Irons footnote, named after the holding in Irons v. Diamond,\n670 F.2d 265, 267-68 & n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the panel “seek[s] for\nits proposed decision the endorsement of the en banc court, and\nannounce[s] that endorsement in a footnote to the panel’s opinion.”\nIrons Footnote Policy at 1.\n\f                              9\n\n274. Oakey’s claim for unpaid disability benefits is of the\nformer type because it involves the application and\ninterpretation of the 1975 Disability Plan and/or the 1997\nAmendment.\n     Oakey also argues Northwest is “contrary to” Supreme\nCourt decisions that narrowly construe ERISA’s exception to\nits state law preemption provision for “any law of any State\nwhich regulates insurance,” 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A). See\nPilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 54 (1987); Rush\nPrudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U.S. 355 (2002); Aetna\nHealth Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200 (2004). We see no\nconflict between Northwest and the cited decisions.\nPreemption of state law is the rule for ERISA enforcement\nand is expansively and inclusively worded, directing that\nERISA’s provisions “shall supersede any and all State laws\ninsofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee\nbenefit plan described.” See 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). It is\nsubject to only a few express statutory exceptions, including\nthe narrowly circumscribed exception for state laws regulating\ninsurance. See 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b). It is therefore no\nsurprise that the Supreme Court accords the preemption\nprovision an “expansive sweep.” Dedeaux, 481 U.S. at 47;\nsee also Davila, 542 U.S. at 208-09 (2004) (citing ERISA’s\n“expansive pre-emption provisions”); Rush Prudential HMO,\n536 U.S. at 376 (noting ERISA’s “extraordinarily preemptive\npower”). The language of ERISA section 514(d) is no less\nexpansive or unequivocal in clarifying that “[n]othing” in\nERISA can “alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or\nsupersede any law of the United States”—including the RLA.\n29 U.S.C. § 1144(d) (emphases added). Section 514(d)\ntherefore warrants a comparably broad application.\n     Finally, we note that notwithstanding Oakey’s claim\nNorthwest’s force has faded in the years since it issued, every\ncircuit that has considered the issue has reached the same\n\f                                 10\n\nconclusion as Northwest: that the district court lacks ERISA\njurisdiction over a dispute involving the interpretation of a\ncollectively-bargained benefit plan within the exclusive\njurisdiction of the appropriate adjustment board pursuant to\nthe RLA. See, e.g., Ballew v. Cont’l Airlines, Inc., 668 F.3d\n777, 782-87 (5th Cir. 2012); Stephens v. Ret. Income Plan for\nPilots of U.S. Air, Inc., 464 F.3d 606, 613-14 (6th Cir. 2006);2\nCoker v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 165 F.3d 579, 583-84\n(7th Cir. 1999); Long v. Flying Tiger Line, Inc. Fixed Pension\nPlan for Pilots, 994 F.2d 692, 695 (9th Cir. 1993); Bowe v.\nNorthwest Airlines, Inc., 974 F.2d 101, 103 (8th Cir. 1992); de\nla Rosa Sanchez v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., 574 F.2d 29, 31-33\n(1st Cir. 1978).\n                     B. Arbitration Standard\n     Second, Oakey asserts that, even if Northwest’s\npreclusion rule survives, it does not apply here. He contends\nthat for the rule to apply (1) the claim “must involve\ninterpretation or construction of the [collective bargaining\nagreement]’s terms,” Appellant’s Br. 22 (citing Air Line\nPilots Ass’n, Int’l v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 869 F.2d 1518,\n1521 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (emphasis in brief)) and (2) “the\ninterpretative issue must be dispositive or conclusive” of the\nclaim, id. at 23 (citing Brown v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 254 F.3d\n654, 668 (7th Cir. 2001) (emphasis in brief)). As we held in\nNorthwest, “non-frivolous statutory claim[s] under ERISA”\nare not subject to RLA preclusion if they are “independent of\nthe correct construction of the pension plan.” 627 F.2d at\n277; see also Brown, 254 F.3d at 658 (“[T]he claim will be\npreempted if it cannot be adjudicated without interpreting the\nCBA, or if it can be conclusively resolved by interpreting the\n\n\n  2\n   The Sixth Circuit has since held that the adjustment board referral\nrequirement is not jurisdictional. See Emswiler v. CSX Transp., Inc.,\n691 F.3d 782, 788 (6th Cir. 2012), discussed infra pp.17-19.\n\f                                   11\n\nCBA.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Everett v. USAir\nGroup, 927 F. Supp. 478, 482 (D.D.C. 1996) (“RLA’s\nmandatory arbitration procedures apply . . . to issues arising\nout of the interpretation of the collective bargaining\nagreement and not to independent statutory claims under\nERISA.”), aff’d, 194 F.3d 137 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (mem.).\nSection 204 refers to arbitration of only those “disputes . . .\ngrowing . . . out of the interpretation or application of\nagreements.” 45 U.S.C. § 184. But Oakey’s claim is plainly\nsuch a dispute. He acknowledges that if the 1997 Amendment\nwas effective, his benefits were properly terminated pursuant\nto its unambiguous terms. See Appellant’s Br. 11 (“The Plan\nwould win if the 1997 Restatement controls because Oakey\ndoes not contest that it contains a provision requiring the\ntermination of disability benefits upon a furlough.”). If, as\nOakey asserts, the 1997 Amendment was ineffective—\nbecause it was not signed by an ALPA representative, see\n1997 Amendment at 19—Oakey might be entitled to benefits\nunder the 1975 Disability Plan if his furlough did not render\nhim “classified as being other than in active service” so as to\nend his benefits coverage thereunder—again, an issue of\ncontract interpretation and one that is dispositive. Whichever\nversion of the Plan agreement controls, its interpretation or\napplication governs the outcome.3\n\n   3\n    Oakey claims the Plan is foreclosed from arguing that arbitration\nwas required based on the need to interpret the 1975 Disability Plan\nbecause “the Plan’s defense must stand or fall” on whether the 1997\nAmendment—which, he claims, the Plan sent Oakey’s counsel “as the\nreason for its determination”—“is legitimate.” Appellant’s Br. 25\n(asserting Plan “sent Oakey as the reason for its determination the one\npage of the purported 1997 Restatement that includes the section\nallowing for termination of benefits upon furlough”). “This is so,” he\nmaintains, “because it is a cardinal rule of ERISA jurisprudence that\na plan’s decision to deny benefits can be upheld, if at all, solely upon\n‘[the] rationales that were specifically articulated in the administrative\n\f                                    12\n\n              C. Forfeiture of Preclusion Argument\n     Finally, Oakey argues the Plan forfeited reliance on\nNorthwest’s preclusion rule. Recognizing that if the rule is\n“jurisdictional”—that is, if section 514(d) vests exclusive\njurisdiction over this dispute in the Retirement Board—his\nforfeiture argument fails, he asserts that the arbitration\nrequirement is “a non-jurisdictional, claims-processing rule\n. . . subject to forfeiture.”4 Appellant’s Br. 50 (citing\nMenominee Indian Tribe of Wis. v. United States, 614 F.3d\n519, 524 (D.C. Cir. 2010)); see Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546\nU.S. 500, 514 (2006) (“ ‘[S]ubject-matter jurisdiction,\nbecause it involves a court’s power to hear a case, can never\nbe forfeited or waived.’ ” (quoting United States v. Cotton,\n\n\nrecord as the basis.’ ” Id. at 24-25 (quoting Flinders v. Workforce\nStabilization Plan of Phillips Petroleum Co., 491 F.3d 1180, 1190\n(10th Cir. 2007)). Oakey’s argument overlooks that there is no\nadministrative record because Oakey failed to pursue mandatory\narbitration to create one. Had he done so and challenged the validity\nof the 1997 Amendment, the Plan would have provided a response and\nwe would have an administrative record to review. But we do not.\n    4\n      The Plan asserts Oakey waived his non-jurisdictional argument\nby failing to raise it below. Appellee’s Br. 35. We believe it\nappropriate, however, to address the argument as it bears on subject\nmatter jurisdiction. See Beckett v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, 59 F.3d 1276,\n1278 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“ ‘[E]very federal appellate court has a\nspecial obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but\nalso that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the\nparties are prepared to concede it.’ ” (quoting Bender v. Williamsport\nArea Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986) (quotation marks omitted;\nalteration in original)); see also Roosevelt v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours\n& Co., 958 F.2d 416, 419 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“Courts of appeals are\nnot rigidly limited to issues raised in the tribunal of first instance; they\nhave a fair measure of discretion to determine what questions to\nconsider and resolve for the first time on appeal.”).\n\f                               13\n\n535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002))). In Northwest, we treated RLA\nsection 204 as vesting exclusive jurisdiction of covered\ndisputes in the applicable adjustment board. See Northwest,\n627 F.32d at 275 (“The arbitral board’s jurisdiction is\nexclusive and cannot be avoided by efforts to bring the\ndispute directly into court.”). Revisiting the issue now, we\nreach the same conclusion.\n    In recent decisions, the Supreme Court has warned\nagainst the “profligate” use of “jurisdictional” to describe\nwhat are in fact non-jurisdictional requirements, specifically\nclaim-processing rules. In Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., the Court\nadvised:\n         “Jurisdiction,” this Court has observed, “is a\n    word of many, too many, meanings.” Steel Co. v.\n    Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 90\n    (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\n    Court, no less than other courts, has sometimes been\n    profligate in its use of the term. For example, this\n    Court and others have occasionally described a\n    nonextendable time limit as “mandatory and\n    jurisdictional.” See, e.g., United States v. Robinson,\n    361 U.S. 220, 229 (1960). But in recent decisions,\n    we have clarified that time prescriptions, however\n    emphatic, “are not properly typed ‘jurisdictional.’ ”\n    Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 414 (2004).\n    . . .        On the subject-matter jurisdiction/\n    ingredient-of-claim-for-relief dichotomy, this Court\n    and others have been less than meticulous. . . .\n    Judicial opinions, the Second Circuit incisively\n    observed, “often obscure the issue by stating that the\n    court is dismissing ‘for lack of jurisdiction’ when\n    some threshold fact has not been established, without\n    explicitly considering whether the dismissal should\n    be for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure\n\f                              14\n\n    to state a claim.” Da Silva [v. Kinsho Int’l Corp., 229\n    F.3d 358, 361 (2d Cir. 2000)]. We have described\n    such unrefined dispositions as “drive-by\n    jurisdictional rulings” that should be accorded “no\n    precedential effect” on the question whether the\n    federal court had authority to adjudicate the claim in\n    suit. Steel Co., 523 U.S., at 91.\n546 U.S. at 515-16; see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n559 U.S. 154 (2010); Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Bhd. of\nLocomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment,\n558 U.S. 67, 71 (2009); Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.S.\n12, 16-19 (2005) (per curiam); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S.\n443, 454-55 (2004); Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416,\n434-35 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., concurring). In order to address\nthe mislabeling point, Arbaugh drew a “readily administrable\nbright line” to segregate jurisdictional prerequisites from non-\njurisdictional mandatory claim-processing rules:\n    If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold\n    limitation on a statute’s scope shall count as\n    jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly\n    instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the\n    issue. But when Congress does not rank a statutory\n    limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts\n    should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in\n    character.\nArbaugh, 546 U.S. at 515–16 (citation and footnote omitted).\nApplying this test, the Arbaugh court concluded that the 15-\nemployee threshold for coverage under Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b), is not\njurisdictional, noting that “the 15-employee threshold appears\nin a separate provision [from Title VII’s jurisdictional\nprovision] that ‘does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer\nin any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.’ ” Id. at\n\f                              15\n\n515 (quoting Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S.\n385, 394 (1982)). We find this to be a quite different case.\n     The jurisdictional inquiry requires an “examination of the\n‘condition’s text, context, and relevant historical treatment,”\nChevron Mining, Inc. v. NLRB, 684 F.3d 1318, 1328 (D.C.\nCir. 2012) (quoting Reed Elsevier, 559 U.S. at 166). We\nbegin, as with all statutory construction, with the text itself.\nSection 204 of the RLA provides in full:\n         The disputes between an employee or group of\n    employees and a carrier or carriers by air growing\n    out of grievances, or out of the interpretation or\n    application of agreements concerning rates of pay,\n    rules, or working conditions, including cases pending\n    and unadjusted on April 10, 1936 before the National\n    Labor Relations Board, shall be handled in the usual\n    manner up to and including the chief operating\n    officer of the carrier designated to handle such\n    disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this\n    manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of\n    the parties or by either party to an appropriate\n    adjustment board, as hereinafter provided, with a full\n    statement of the facts and supporting data bearing\n    upon the disputes.\n         It shall be the duty of every carrier and of its\n    employees, acting through their representatives,\n    selected in accordance with the provisions of this\n    subchapter, to establish a board of adjustment of\n    jurisdiction not exceeding the jurisdiction which may\n    be lawfully exercised by system, group, or regional\n    boards of adjustment, under the authority of section\n    153 of this title.\n        Such boards of adjustment may be established\n    by agreement between employees and carriers either\n\f                              16\n\n    on any individual carrier, or system, or group of\n    carriers by air and any class or classes of its or their\n    employees; or pending the establishment of a\n    permanent National Board of Adjustment as\n    hereinafter provided. Nothing in this chapter shall\n    prevent said carriers by air, or any class or classes of\n    their employees, both acting through their\n    representatives selected in accordance with\n    provisions of this subchapter, from mutually\n    agreeing to the establishment of a National Board of\n    Adjustment of temporary duration and of similarly\n    limited jurisdiction.\n45 U.S.C. § 184. The statutory language “clearly states” that\nthe arbitration requirement is jurisdictional, expressly\n“ ‘speak[ing] in jurisdictional terms.’ ” Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at\n515 (quoting Zipes, 455 U.S. at 394). It directs that “every\ncarrier and . . . its employees” establish a board of adjustment\n“of jurisdiction not exceeding the jurisdiction which may be\nlawfully exercised by . . . boards of adjustment, under [RLA\n§ 3, 45 U.S.C. § 153]”—which cited provision establishes a\n“ ‘National Railroad Adjustment Board [(NRAB)] . . . [t]o\nhave jurisdiction over disputes involving” various rail carrier\nemployees. 45 U.S.C. § 153 First. In fact, the Supreme Court\nrecently confirmed, in a non-drive-by-ruling, that section 204\nis jurisdictional.      In Union Pacific Railroad Co. v.\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers & Trainmen General\nCommittee of Adjustment, the Court concluded that, while the\nCongress “authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the\npresentation and processing of claims,” such rules as the\nNRAB might adopt are not jurisdictional because “Congress\nalone controls the [NRAB’s] jurisdiction.” 558 U.S. at 71.\nThe Court explained that in RLA section 3 the Congress\n“vested in the [NRAB] jurisdiction to adjudicate grievances of\nrailroad employees that remain unsettled after pursuit of\ninternal procedures.” Id.; see also id. at 82 (“The [NRAB’s]\n\f                               17\n\njurisdiction extends to all disputes between carriers and their\nemployees growing out of grievances or out of the\ninterpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of\npay, rules, or working conditions . . . . ” (ellipsis in original;\nquotation marks omitted)). Given that section 204 expressly\ngrants the adjustment boards jurisdiction co-extensive with\nthe NRAB’s, we can but conclude that the provision is\njurisdictional regarding its adjustment board arbitration\nrequirement. Cf. Chevron Mining, 684 F.3d at 1329 (finding\nNational Labor Relation Act section 10(e)’s exhaustion\nrequirement jurisdictional because its “text is virtually\nidentical to section 313 of the Federal Power Act, which we\nhave held is a model of the ‘clear and unequivocal statement’\nrequired to make exhaustion a jurisdictional prerequisite”\n(quoting EEOC v. Lutheran Soc. Servs., 186 F.3d 959, 962–63\n(D.C. Cir. 1999)). Moreover, the Supreme Court’s “historical\ntreatment” of RLA § 3 as conferring “exclusive” jurisdiction\nover collective bargaining agreement disputes further supports\nour conclusion that jurisdiction lies with the adjustment board.\nSee Consol. Rail Corp. v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 491 U.S.\n299, 304 (1989); Locomotive Eng’rs v. Louisville & Nashville\nR.R. Co., 373 U.S. 33, 38 (1963); Penn. R.R. v. Day, 360 U.S.\n548, 552 (1959); Slocum v. Del., Lackawanna & W. R.R. Co.,\n339 U.S. 239, 244 (1950).\n     In urging that section 204’s arbitration requirement is not\njurisdictional, Oakey relies heavily on the Sixth Circuit’s\nopinion in Emswiler v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 691 F.3d\n782, 788 (6th Cir. 2012), the only circuit decision to hold that\nsection 204’s arbitration requirement is not jurisdictional. We\nrespectfully decline to join our sister circuit in its singular\nperspective.\n    In Emswiler, the Sixth Circuit based its holding on three\npremises.   First, it observed that collective bargaining\nagreement disputes “raise a question ‘arising under’ federal\n\f                               18\n\nlaw” and therefore should be subject to the district court’s\nfederal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.” Id. at\n789. But the “federal law” in question here is RLA section\n204, which expressly and unequivocally consigns\ninterpretation/application disputes to arbitration before the\nappropriate adjustment board—with no mention of federal\ncourt jurisdiction. Second, the Sixth Circuit asserts that the\nfailure to arbitrate affects the plaintiff’s “ability to prove the\ndefendant bound by the federal law asserted as the predicate\nfor relief—a merits-related determination.” Id. (quoting\nArbaugh, 546 U.S. at 511 (quotation marks omitted)). The\nselection of the proper statutory forum, however—unlike the\n15-employee threshold Arbaugh described—is not a “merits-\nrelated determination.” Finally, the Sixth Circuit reasoned\nthat “[t]he fact that courts have recognized exceptions to the\nRLA arbitral requirement supports the conclusion that the\nrequirement is a nonjurisdictional restriction.” Id. at 790. In\nparticular, the court relied on an exception if “pursuing\narbitral mechanisms would be futile due to collusion between\nthe union and employer.” Id. (citing Glover v. St. Louis-S.F.\nRy. Co., 393 U.S. 324, 331 (1969)). In Glover, however, the\nSupreme Court explained that the RLA’s arbitration\nrequirement did not confer jurisdiction over the dispute there\nbecause “the suit was one brought by the employees against\ntheir own union, claiming breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation,” while RLA § 3 First (i) (like section 204)\n“applies only to ‘disputes between an employee or group of\nemployees and a carrier or carriers.’ ” 393 U.S. at 328\n(quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 44 (1957) (quoting\n45 U.S.C. § 153 First (i))). Moreover, the Court in Glover\nexpressly affirmed that it had previously “held that the\nRailroad Adjustment Board has exclusive jurisdiction, under\n[RLA § 3 First (i)] . . . to interpret the meaning of the terms\nof a collective bargaining agreement.” Id. (footnote omitted;\nemphasis added). As we have already noted, the statutory\n\f                             19\n\nlanguage—to which Arbaugh unequivocally directs us for our\nanswer—“clearly states” the adjustment board has\njurisdiction. The Sixth Circuit strayed in directing its focus\nelsewhere.\n    For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\njudgment of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n                                                  So ordered.\n\f",

Factual Background\n     Oakey was employed as an airline pilot by US Airways\nfrom 1988 to 2002 and was enrolled in the US Airways Pilot\nDisability Plan (Plan), which initially took effect on January\n1, 1975—the effective date of ERISA—as the result of\ncollective bargaining between US Airways’ predecessor\n(Allegheny Airlines) and the Air Line Pilots Association\n(ALPA).      The original Plan agreement contained the\nfollowing provision governing the term of its coverage: “Each\n\f                               4\n\npilot will become covered for benefits on the date he is\nemployed and is classified as being in active service. If a\npilot becomes classified as being other than in active service,\nhe will no longer be covered as of the date of such change in\nemployment status.” Allegheny Airlines Pilot’s Long Term\nDisability & Loss of License Plan (1975 Disability Plan) art.\n5.1 (Jan. 1, 1975) (JA 593). The 1975 Disability Plan does\nnot define “active service” or address the effect of a pilot’s\nfurlough status on benefits eligibility. In 1997, however, US\nAirways produced an “amended and restated” version of the\nplan. USAir, Inc. Pilot Disability Plan (effective Feb. 18,\n1997) (1997 Amendment) (JA 63). The 1997 Amendment is\nsigned by a US Airways officer but not by an ALPA\nrepresentative. Id. at 18-19. It defines “active service” as\n“those periods during which the Employee is in active payroll\nstatus with the Employer,” id. art. 1.2, and specifically\nprovides that “[b]enefits payable [t]hereunder shall cease\nupon . . . the date the Participant is placed on furlough status\nfrom the Employer,” id. art. 3.6.\n     Under both the 1975 Disability Plan and the 1997\nAmendment, benefit claims are reviewed and decided by the\nUS Airways Retirement Board, see also Letter of Agreement\nBetween US Air, Inc. and the airline Pilots re: RETIREMENT\nBOARD (JA 558) § 1.6. (Feb. 9, 1990). The Retirement\nBoard consists of four members—two selected by US\nAirways and two by ALPA. A decision by agreement of three\nor more Retirement Board members is “final and binding.”\nId. Absent such agreement, an “Impartial Referee” is\ndesignated to sit as a fifth member of the Retirement Board\nand a subsequent decision by three or more members is then\n“final and binding upon all parties.” Id. § 2.1.\n    In 2001, after he was diagnosed with leukemia, Oakey\nsubmitted a claim for disability benefits to the Retirement\nBoard, which approved the claim effective January 30, 2002.\n\f                              5\n\nThe following January, US Airways notified Oakey he was to\nbe “furloughed” effective February 4, 2003 as part of a fleet\nreduction. Letter of US Airways to Michael S. Oakey (Jan. 9,\n2003) (JA 441). On March 11, 2003, the Administrator of the\nPlan (Administrator) advised Oakey that, based on his\nfurlough date, his disability benefits had terminated on\nFebruary 4, 2003.\n     Oakey subsequently requested, through legal counsel,\nthat the Administrator provide a “copy of the disability\npolicy.” Letter from Bruce E. Woodske to ING at 1 (Mar. 25,\n2003) (JA 175). Oakey’s counsel was referred to US\nAirways, which transmitted a copy of Article 3.6 of the 1997\nAmendment stating, to repeat, that disability benefits cease on\nthe date a participant is “placed on furlough status.”\nFacsimile from US AIRWAYS to Bruce E. Woodske (Apr. 1,\n2003) (JA 182). Oakey’s counsel subsequently requested “the\nentire benefits plan with all amendments to the present.”\nFacsimile from Bruce E. Woodske to US Airways (Apr. 21,\n2003) (JA 190). Nonetheless, Oakey “never received a copy\nof the Disability Plan from US Airways, despite the\nrequirement of ERISA § 104(b)(4), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(b)(4),\nthat such plan documents be provided promptly upon\nrequest.” Second Am. Compl. (Compl.) ¶ 27. In August\n2003, Oakey took early (and reduced) retirement.\n     In November 2003, Oakey and six other retired US\nAirways pilots filed an action under ERISA against, inter alia,\nUS Airways and the Plan for benefits allegedly owed. On\nOctober 21, 2011, Oakey, the only remaining plaintiff, filed a\n“Second Amended Complaint” (Complaint) against the Plan,\nthe only remaining defendant, alleging a single claim for\nunpaid benefits resulting from the wrongful termination of his\ndisability benefits in February 2003. The Complaint asserts\nthat the 1997 Amendment was ineffective because it was not\nsigned by an ALPA representative, Compl. ¶¶ 7-10, and that\n\f                                6\n\nOakey’s disability coverage was therefore governed by the\n1975 Disability Plan, which does not terminate benefits upon\nan employee’s furlough. Compl. ¶¶ 10, 40-42.\n     On December 12, 2011, the Plan moved under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction on the ground that the RLA’s mandatory\narbitration provision deprived the district court of jurisdiction.\nOn March 19, 2012, the district court granted the Plan’s\nmotion and dismissed the action.

Cir. 1980), we first\naddressed the interplay between the RLA and ERISA and\nconcluded that the latter (and later-enacted)\nstatute—notwithstanding its broad preemption of state law\nremedies—has no preemptive effect on other federal\nenactments—including the RLA. As we noted in Northwest,\nthe Congress “made its will very clear” on this point when it\ndeclared in section 514(d) of ERISA:\n         “Nothing in this title [] shall be construed to\n    alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede\n    any law of the United States (except as provided in\n    sections 1031 and 1137(b) of this title) or any rule or\n    regulation issued under any such law.”\n\f                               7\n\n627 F.2d at 275 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1144(d) (alterations in\noriginal)).    Given the “strong, comprehensive, express\nstatement that ERISA is not to be read as displacing by\nimplication any pre-existing federal legislation,” the\nNorthwest court concluded that ERISA has no effect on RLA\nsection 204’s “mandate[ that] the carrier or the union [] refer\ndisputes over the application or interpretation of bargaining\nagreements covering [rates of pay, rules, or working\nconditions’ terms including employee pensions], if they\ncannot be resolved informally, to arbitration.” Id. at 275-76\n(quoting 45 U.S.C. § 184 (emphasis added)). In Northwest,\nwe emphasized that referral to the board of adjustment for\narbitration “is a compulsory statutory obligation.” Id. at 275.\nThus, referral to the Retirement Board is compulsory for\nOakey because the dispute is plainly “over the application or\ninterpretation” of the Plan, which controls the outcome\nwhether the 1975 or the 1997 version governs. Accordingly,\nunder Northwest, exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute lies\nwith the Retirement Board and the district court correctly\ndismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. Nonetheless,\nOakey challenges the district court’s dismissal on three\ngrounds.\n            A. Continuing Vitality of Northwest\n     First, Oakey asserts that Northwest is no longer good law\nand that we should overrule it through an “Irons footnote.” It\nis true that, in a case “in which action by the court en banc\nmay be called for, but the circumstances of the case or the\nimportance of the legal questions presented do not warrant the\nheavy administrative burdens of full en banc hearing,” a panel\nof the court may use an “Irons footnote” to “overrul[e] a . . .\nprecedent which, due to an intervening Supreme Court\ndecision, or the combined weight of authority from other\ncircuits, a panel is convinced is clearly an incorrect statement\nof current law.” Policy Statement on En Banc Endorsement\n\f                                  8\n\nof Panel Decisions (Irons Footnote Policy) at 1 (Jan. 17,\n1996).1 But we are not the least convinced intervening\ncaselaw has vitiated Northwest’s rationale.\n     Oakey contends that Northwest is inconsistent with the\nUnited States Supreme Court’s holding in Atchison, Topeka &\nSanta Fe Ry. Co. v. Buell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111843\"><a href=\"/opinion/111843/atchison-t-sfr-co-v-buell/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), which he\ncharacterizes as “highly suggestive that the RLA does not\npreclude ERISA claims.” Appellant’s Br. 35. We disagree.\nIn Buell, the Court concluded that the RLA did not preclude\nthe plaintiff’s negligence claim against his employer under the\nFederal Employers’ Liability Act, which “provides railroad\nworkers with substantive protection against negligent conduct\nthat is independent of the employer’s obligations under its\ncollective-bargaining agreement [and] also affords injured\nworkers a remedy suited to their needs.” 480 U.S. at 565\n(emphasis added). In so holding, however, the Buell Court\nconfirmed its decision in Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville\nR.R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108534\"><a href=\"/opinion/108534/andrews-v-louisville-nashville-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325 (1972), that for a “claim based\nsquarely on an alleged breach of the collective-bargaining\nagreement,” the Congress “intended the RLA dispute\nresolution mechanism to be mandatory” and “courts were\ntherefore foreclosed from addressing claims that properly\narise under the RLA.” Buell, 480 U.S. at 566. In Northwest,\nwe recognized the same distinction between a claim involving\n“the application and interpretation of the pension plan,” for\nwhich arbitration was compulsory under the RLA, and those\nclaims stating “violations of ERISA which are independent of\nthe coverage and meaning of the pension plan,” noting that\nthe latter may be litigated in court. Northwest, 627 F.2d at\n\n  1\n    In an Irons footnote, named after the holding in Irons v. Diamond,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399262\"><a href=\"/opinion/399262/edward-s-irons-v-sidney-a-diamond-commissioner-of-patents-edward-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267-68 & n.11 (D.C.

Oakey’s claim for unpaid disability benefits is of the\nformer type because it involves the application and\ninterpretation of the 1975 Disability Plan and/or the 1997\nAmendment.\n     Oakey also argues Northwest is “contrary to” Supreme\nCourt decisions that narrowly construe ERISA’s exception to\nits state law preemption provision for “any law of any State\nwhich regulates insurance,” 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A). See\nPilot Life Ins. Co. v.

We see no\nconflict between Northwest and the cited decisions.\nPreemption of state law is the rule for ERISA enforcement\nand is expansively and inclusively worded, directing that\nERISA’s provisions “shall supersede any and all State laws\ninsofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee\nbenefit plan described.” See 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). It is\nsubject to only a few express statutory exceptions, including\nthe narrowly circumscribed exception for state laws regulating\ninsurance. See 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b). It is therefore no\nsurprise that the Supreme Court accords the preemption\nprovision an “expansive sweep.” Dedeaux, 481 U.S. at 47;\nsee also Davila, 542 U.S. at 208-09 (2004) (citing ERISA’s\n“expansive pre-emption provisions”); Rush Prudential HMO,\n536 U.S. at 376 (noting ERISA’s “extraordinarily preemptive\npower”). The language of ERISA section 514(d) is no less\nexpansive or unequivocal in clarifying that “[n]othing” in\nERISA can “alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or\nsupersede any law of the United States”—including the RLA.\n29 U.S.C. § 1144(d) (emphases added). Section 514(d)\ntherefore warrants a comparably broad application.\n     Finally, we note that notwithstanding Oakey’s claim\nNorthwest’s force has faded in the years since it issued, every\ncircuit that has considered the issue has reached the same\n\f                                 10\n\nconclusion as Northwest: that the district court lacks ERISA\njurisdiction over a dispute involving the interpretation of a\ncollectively-bargained benefit plan within the exclusive\njurisdiction of the appropriate adjustment board pursuant to\nthe RLA.

But Oakey’s claim is plainly\nsuch a dispute. He acknowledges that if the 1997 Amendment\nwas effective, his benefits were properly terminated pursuant\nto its unambiguous terms. See Appellant’s Br. 11 (“The Plan\nwould win if the 1997 Restatement controls because Oakey\ndoes not contest that it contains a provision requiring the\ntermination of disability benefits upon a furlough.”). If, as\nOakey asserts, the 1997 Amendment was ineffective—\nbecause it was not signed by an ALPA representative, see\n1997 Amendment at 19—Oakey might be entitled to benefits\nunder the 1975 Disability Plan if his furlough did not render\nhim “classified as being other than in active service” so as to\nend his benefits coverage thereunder—again, an issue of\ncontract interpretation and one that is dispositive. Whichever\nversion of the Plan agreement controls, its interpretation or\napplication governs the outcome.3\n\n   3\n    Oakey claims the Plan is foreclosed from arguing that arbitration\nwas required based on the need to interpret the 1975 Disability Plan\nbecause “the Plan’s defense must stand or fall” on whether the 1997\nAmendment—which, he claims, the Plan sent Oakey’s counsel “as the\nreason for its determination”—“is legitimate.” Appellant’s Br. 25\n(asserting Plan “sent Oakey as the reason for its determination the one\npage of the purported 1997 Restatement that includes the section\nallowing for termination of benefits upon furlough”). “This is so,” he\nmaintains, “because it is a cardinal rule of ERISA jurisprudence that\na plan’s decision to deny benefits can be upheld, if at all, solely upon\n‘[the] rationales that were specifically articulated in the administrative\n\f                                    12\n\n              C. Forfeiture of Preclusion Argument\n     Finally, Oakey argues the Plan forfeited reliance on\nNorthwest’s preclusion rule. Recognizing that if the rule is\n“jurisdictional”—that is, if section 514(d) vests exclusive\njurisdiction over this dispute in the Retirement Board—his\nforfeiture argument fails, he asserts that the arbitration\nrequirement is “a non-jurisdictional, claims-processing rule\n. . . subject to forfeiture.”4 Appellant’s Br. 50 (citing\nMenominee Indian Tribe of Wis. v.

In order to address\nthe mislabeling point, Arbaugh drew a “readily administrable\nbright line” to segregate jurisdictional prerequisites from non-\njurisdictional mandatory claim-processing rules:\n    If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold\n    limitation on a statute’s scope shall count as\n    jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly\n    instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the\n    issue. But when Congress does not rank a statutory\n    limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts\n    should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in\n    character.\nArbaugh, 546 U.S. at 515–16 (citation and footnote omitted).\nApplying this test, the Arbaugh court concluded that the 15-\nemployee threshold for coverage under Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b), is not\njurisdictional, noting that “the 15-employee threshold appears\nin a separate provision [from Title VII’s jurisdictional\nprovision] that ‘does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer\nin any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.’ ” Id. at\n\f                              15\n\n515 (quoting Zipes v.

We find this to be a quite different case.\n     The jurisdictional inquiry requires an “examination of the\n‘condition’s text, context, and relevant historical treatment,”\nChevron Mining, Inc. v.

We\nbegin, as with all statutory construction, with the text itself.\nSection 204 of the RLA provides in full:\n         The disputes between an employee or group of\n    employees and a carrier or carriers by air growing\n    out of grievances, or out of the interpretation or\n    application of agreements concerning rates of pay,\n    rules, or working conditions, including cases pending\n    and unadjusted on April 10, 1936 before the National\n    Labor Relations Board, shall be handled in the usual\n    manner up to and including the chief operating\n    officer of the carrier designated to handle such\n    disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this\n    manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of\n    the parties or by either party to an appropriate\n    adjustment board, as hereinafter provided, with a full\n    statement of the facts and supporting data bearing\n    upon the disputes.\n         It shall be the duty of every carrier and of its\n    employees, acting through their representatives,\n    selected in accordance with the provisions of this\n    subchapter, to establish a board of adjustment of\n    jurisdiction not exceeding the jurisdiction which may\n    be lawfully exercised by system, group, or regional\n    boards of adjustment, under the authority of section\n    153 of this title.\n        Such boards of adjustment may be established\n    by agreement between employees and carriers either\n\f                              16\n\n    on any individual carrier, or system, or group of\n    carriers by air and any class or classes of its or their\n    employees; or pending the establishment of a\n    permanent National Board of Adjustment as\n    hereinafter provided. Nothing in this chapter shall\n    prevent said carriers by air, or any class or classes of\n    their employees, both acting through their\n    representatives selected in accordance with\n    provisions of this subchapter, from mutually\n    agreeing to the establishment of a National Board of\n    Adjustment of temporary duration and of similarly\n    limited jurisdiction.\n45 U.S.C. § 184. The statutory language “clearly states” that\nthe arbitration requirement is jurisdictional, expressly\n“ ‘speak[ing] in jurisdictional terms.’ ” Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at\n515 (quoting Zipes, 455 U.S. at 394). It directs that “every\ncarrier and . . . its employees” establish a board of adjustment\n“of jurisdiction not exceeding the jurisdiction which may be\nlawfully exercised by . . . boards of adjustment, under [RLA\n§ 3, 45 U.S.C. § 153]”—which cited provision establishes a\n“ ‘National Railroad Adjustment Board [(NRAB)] . . . [t]o\nhave jurisdiction over disputes involving” various rail carrier\nemployees. 45 U.S.C. § 153 First. In fact, the Supreme Court\nrecently confirmed, in a non-drive-by-ruling, that section 204\nis jurisdictional.      In Union Pacific Railroad Co. v.\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers & Trainmen General\nCommittee of Adjustment, the Court concluded that, while the\nCongress “authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the\npresentation and processing of claims,” such rules as the\nNRAB might adopt are not jurisdictional because “Congress\nalone controls the [NRAB’s] jurisdiction.” 558 U.S. at 71.\nThe Court explained that in RLA section 3 the Congress\n“vested in the [NRAB] jurisdiction to adjudicate grievances of\nrailroad employees that remain unsettled after pursuit of\ninternal procedures.” Id.; see also id. at 82 (“The [NRAB’s]\n\f                               17\n\njurisdiction extends to all disputes between carriers and their\nemployees growing out of grievances or out of the\ninterpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of\npay, rules, or working conditions . . . . ” (ellipsis in original;\nquotation marks omitted)). Given that section 204 expressly\ngrants the adjustment boards jurisdiction co-extensive with\nthe NRAB’s, we can but conclude that the provision is\njurisdictional regarding its adjustment board arbitration\nrequirement. Cf. Chevron Mining, 684 F.3d at 1329 (finding\nNational Labor Relation Act section 10(e)’s exhaustion\nrequirement jurisdictional because its “text is virtually\nidentical to section 313 of the Federal Power Act, which we\nhave held is a model of the ‘clear and unequivocal statement’\nrequired to make exhaustion a jurisdictional prerequisite”\n(quoting EEOC v.

CSX Transportation, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">782</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788 (6th Cir. 2012), the only circuit decision to hold that\nsection 204’s arbitration requirement is not jurisdictional. We\nrespectfully decline to join our sister circuit in its singular\nperspective.\n    In Emswiler, the Sixth Circuit based its holding on three\npremises.   First, it observed that collective bargaining\nagreement disputes “raise a question ‘arising under’ federal\n\f                               18\n\nlaw” and therefore should be subject to the district court’s\nfederal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.” Id. at\n789. But the “federal law” in question here is RLA section\n204, which expressly and unequivocally consigns\ninterpretation/application disputes to arbitration before the\nappropriate adjustment board—with no mention of federal\ncourt jurisdiction. Second, the Sixth Circuit asserts that the\nfailure to arbitrate affects the plaintiff’s “ability to prove the\ndefendant bound by the federal law asserted as the predicate\nfor relief—a merits-related determination.” Id. (quoting\nArbaugh, 546 U.S. at 511 (quotation marks omitted)). The\nselection of the proper statutory forum, however—unlike the\n15-employee threshold Arbaugh described—is not a “merits-\nrelated determination.” Finally, the Sixth Circuit reasoned\nthat “[t]he fact that courts have recognized exceptions to the\nRLA arbitral requirement supports the conclusion that the\nrequirement is a nonjurisdictional restriction.” Id. at 790. In\nparticular, the court relied on an exception if “pursuing\narbitral mechanisms would be futile due to collusion between\nthe union and employer.” Id. (citing Glover v. St. Louis-S.F.\nRy. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107819\"><a href=\"/opinion/107819/glover-v-st-louis-san-francisco-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331 (1969)). In Glover, however, the\nSupreme Court explained that the RLA’s arbitration\nrequirement did not confer jurisdiction over the dispute there\nbecause “the suit was one brought by the employees against\ntheir own union, claiming breach of the duty of fair\nrepresentation,” while RLA § 3 First (i) (like section 204)\n“applies only to ‘disputes between an employee or group of\nemployees and a carrier or carriers.’ ” 393 U.S. at 328\n(quoting Conley v. Gibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44 (1957) (quoting\n45 U.S.C. § 153 First (i))). Moreover, the Court in Glover\nexpressly affirmed that it had previously “held that the\nRailroad Adjustment Board has exclusive jurisdiction, under\n[RLA § 3 First (i)] . . . to interpret the meaning of the terms\nof a collective bargaining agreement.” Id. (footnote omitted;\nemphasis added). As we have already noted, the statutory\n\f                             19\n\nlanguage—to which Arbaugh unequivocally directs us for our\nanswer—“clearly states” the adjustment board has\njurisdiction. The Sixth Circuit strayed in directing its focus\nelsewhere.\n    For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\njudgment of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n                                                  So ordered.\n\f</pre>",
