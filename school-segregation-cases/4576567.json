The District Court\ngranted that request, finding likely violations of Pennsylvania\nlaw and a provision of a federal statute we’ve never\naddressed—the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974\n(EEOA), 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f). The School District appeals,\nasking us to vacate that order. We will affirm based on the\nEEOA violations but not on the state law violations.\n                               I\n                              A\n       The named plaintiffs, now the appellees, are\nimmigrants, ages 18 to 21. They fled war, violence, and\npersecution in their native countries to come to the United\nStates, arriving here since 2014. International refugee\nagencies resettled them in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. None are\nnative English speakers. As students, all fall within a\nsubgroup of ELLs called SLIFE—students with limited or\ninterrupted formal education. SLIFE are English language\nlearners who are two or more years behind their appropriate\ngrade level, possess limited or no literacy in any language,\n\n\n\n                              4\n\fhave limited or interrupted formal educational backgrounds,\nand have endured stressful experiences causing acculturation\nchallenges. The named plaintiffs embody these traits.\n       Born in January 1998, Khadidja Issa, 19, fled Sudan\nwhen she was 5 to escape “insecurity” under President Omar\nal-Bashir. J.A. 568–69, 980. Until age 17, she lived in refugee\ncamps in Chad where she received her only prior schooling.\nHer native language is Fur. She also speaks Arabic. After\nimmigrating here in October 2015, she was resettled with her\nfamily in Lancaster. When she first arrived, she couldn’t\nspeak, read, write, or understand any English. She’s eligible\nto attend public school in Pennsylvania through 2019, the\nyear she turns 21.1\n       Qasin Hassan (or Q. M. H.), 18, was born in Somalia\nin September 1998. When he was 12, al-Shabaab militants\nkilled his father. He fled to Egypt. A native Somali speaker,\nhe took private lessons at home and learned “a little bit” of\nArabic, but he wasn’t accepted into Egyptian schools. J.A.\n575. He arrived in Lancaster with his family in September\n2015 speaking only “a few words” of English. Id. Like Issa,\nhe’s eligible to attend public school in Pennsylvania through\n2019, the year he turns 21.\n\n\n     1\n         Pennsylvania law provides that “[e]very child”\nbetween ages 6 and 21 “may attend the public schools in his\ndistrict” and that a child who reaches age 21 “during the\nschool term and who has not graduated from high school may\ncontinue to attend the public schools in his district free of\ncharge until the end of the school term.” 24 Pa. Stat. § 13-\n1301. “A child’s right to be admitted to school may not be\nconditioned on the child’s immigration status.” 22 Pa. Code §\n11.11(d).\n\n\n\n                              5\n\f        Sisters Sui Hnem Sung and Van Ni Iang (or V. N. I.),\nborn in October 1996 and October 1998, fled Burma when\ntheir father was forced into labor there. Sung, 20, and Iang,\n18, arrived with their family in Lancaster in November 2015.\nBy then, Sung had completed ninth grade and Iang eighth, but\nneither spoke or understood any English. Their native\nlanguage is Hakha Chin. Sung is eligible to attend public\nschool in Pennsylvania through 2017, the year she turns 21,\nand Iang is eligible through 2019, when she turns 21.\n       War forced brothers Alembe and Anyemu Dunia, ages\n21 and 19, to flee “very bad” circumstances in Tanzania to\nMozambique, where life in refugee camps remained “very\nbad” and “very difficult.” J.A. 615–16, 618. Native Swahili\nspeakers, they were taught in Portuguese until the eighth or\nninth grade when they could no longer afford schooling. With\n\n\n\n\n                             6\n\ftheir family, they arrived in Lancaster in November 2014\nspeaking “just basic” English, like “hello” and “hi.” J.A. 618.2\n         The International School and Phoenix Academy\n       The School District of Lancaster, the appellant in this\ncase, administers numerous schools. Two are relevant here:\nMcCaskey High School, which the School District operates\ndirectly, and Phoenix Academy, operated by Camelot Schools\n\n\n\n     2\n        After the preliminary injunction issued, Alembe and\nAnyemu Dunia decided they no longer wished to attend\nschool in the School District. Alembe is now 21 and Anyemu\nalready earned a high school diploma at Phoenix, so both\n“wish to further their education at community college.”\nAppellees’ Resp. to Stay Mot. 4 n.2. Though the complaint’s\nrequest for “supplemental educational services” as\ncompensatory relief for the School District’s alleged\nviolations (J.A. 97) might in other circumstances sustain a\nlive claim, here, the brothers have “chose[n] not to enroll”\nand disavowed any intention to “further their education”\nwithin the School District. Appellees’ Resp. to Stay Mot. 4\nn.2. Their claims for equitable relief are therefore moot. See\nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 136 S. Ct. 663, 669 (2016)\n(“If an intervening circumstance deprives the plaintiff of a\npersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit, at any point\nduring litigation, [his or her claims] can no longer proceed\nand must be dismissed as moot.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). On remand, the District Court should dismiss them\nas such. Nevertheless, because the brothers’ testimony and\nother evidence about their experiences with the School\nDistrict formed, in part, the basis for this preliminary\ninjunction, we consider it on appeal.\n\n\n\n                               7\n\fof Pennsylvania, LLC, a private, for-profit company under\ncontract with the School District.\n       McCaskey High School consists of two smaller\nschools. One is J.P. McCaskey, a traditional public high\nschool. The other is McCaskey East, known as the\nInternational School. The International School is a program\ndesigned primarily to teach language skills to students who\nspeak little, if any, English.3 Those students generally attend\nthe International School for one year, after which they join\nJ.P. McCaskey’s general population. During that year, they\nreceive “intensive ESL” (English as a second language)\nsupport through two 48-minute ESL courses per day. J.A.\n901, 1071. For “content” classes—science, math, social\nstudies, and other “enrichment subjects”—ELLs at the\nInternational School receive “content-based ESL” teaching\nthrough a method called “sheltered instruction.” J.A. 901.\nUnder that method, ELLs, including SLIFE, are grouped\ntogether in content courses with other ELLs at comparable\nEnglish-proficiency levels. ELLs are hence “sheltered” in\nthose classes from other ELLs at higher proficiency levels\nand from native English speakers. To foster English-language\nproficiency, the International School also introduces ELLs to\nnew American “cultural values and beliefs” while respecting\ntheir “cultural diversity” and embraces “close communication\n\n\n     3\n      Under 22 Pa. Code § 4.26, “[e]very school district shall\nprovide a program for each student whose dominant language\nis not English for the purpose of facilitating the student’s\nachievement of English proficiency and the academic\nstandards” of 22 Pa. Code § 4.12. Programs “shall include\nappropriate bilingual-bicultural or English as a second\nlanguage (ESL) instruction.” Id. § 4.26.\n\n\n\n                              8\n\fwith families” and “access to appropriate translation\nservices.” Id.\n        Phoenix Academy is, as the District Court said, “a\nlittle different.” Issa v. Sch. Dist. of Lancaster, No. 16-3881,\n2016 WL 4493202, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 26, 2016). It’s an\n“alternative education program” intended to serve “at-risk\nStudents” over-age for their grade, under-credited, and in\ndanger of not graduating high school before they age out of\npublic-school eligibility at 21. J.A. 904, 910. Phoenix’s\nprincipal missions are to ensure that students accumulate\nenough credits to graduate and to change students’ negative\nbehaviors—not to further their academic proficiencies. A\nsignificant portion of grading is therefore based on students’\nbehavior and attendance, known as “seat time.” J.A. 544, 639.\nIn step with its mission to change students’ “anti-social”\nbehaviors, J.A. 1039, Phoenix enforces stringent security\nmeasures not in effect at McCaskey, including daily pat-down\nsearches. Phoenix bars its students from bringing in or out\nany personal belongings, like backpacks, food, books, and\neven homework. And a strict dress code is in place. Based on\na hierarchical system, students are rewarded with different\ncolored shirts as they demonstrate improved behavior.\n       Teaching is also different at Phoenix. All Phoenix\nstudents, including ELLs, take an accelerated curriculum\nallowing them to earn a high school diploma in roughly half\n(but sometimes less than half) the time of a traditional four-\nyear high school, like McCaskey. Phoenix students take five\n80-minute classes per day, generally completing each class in\nhalf an academic year (90 days). McCaskey students, in\ncontrast, take seven 48-minute classes per day, generally\ncompleting each class in a full academic year (180 days).\nUnder these different schedules, McCaskey students receive\n\n\n\n\n                               9\n\fabout 1,440 more minutes, or twenty-four more hours, of\ninstruction per class than do students at Phoenix, the\nequivalent of about thirty more 48-minute class periods per\nclass. The upshot is, as one former Phoenix teacher put it, that\nPhoenix’s curriculum must be taught “double time.” J.A. 632.\n        Phoenix’s program for teaching English to ELLs also\ndiffers from the International School’s. Phoenix offers ELLs\nof all levels, with no special accommodations for SLIFE, one\n80-minute ESL course per day. Otherwise, ELLs, including\nSLIFE, take all their content courses—science, math, social\nstudies—with Phoenix’s general population under the\naccelerated model. In those content classes, ELLs aren’t\nsheltered from each other by their English proficiency or from\nnative English speakers like they are at the International\nSchool.\n       How does the School District empirically evaluate the\nefficacy of Phoenix’s ESL program? It doesn’t. The School\nDistrict does not assess in any measurable way whether\nPhoenix’s program helps ELLs overcome their language\nbarriers. It hasn’t attempted to weigh concretely the impact\nPhoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program has on ELLs,\nincluding SLIFE. Raw data about Phoenix’s ESL program\napparently exists. But the School District doesn’t\ndisaggregate it from data about the International School’s\nESL program. Because the two programs rely on different\nESL teaching methods, commingling the data means the\nSchool District cannot quantify whether Phoenix’s ESL\nprogram is successful.\n  The School District’s Enrollment Policies and Practices\n       Enrollment in Phoenix rather than McCaskey is\nusually a choice offered to students and their families. But\none group of prospective students isn’t offered that choice:\n\n\n\n                              10\n\fnew-to-the-District students over age 17 and under-credited.\nFor students in that category (which included the plaintiffs),\nthe choice is made for them: The School District unilaterally\nassigns them to Phoenix and doesn’t allow them to transfer to\nMcCaskey. This mandatory enrollment rule applies regardless\nof a student’s English proficiency or educational background\nand even if the student has several years of public school\neligibility left under Pennsylvania law. The School District\ndoes this, it says, because these students represent a higher\nrisk of dropping out or aging out at age 21 before earning a\nhigh school diploma, which is a prerequisite for future\nadvancement. But the School District’s funding and\nevaluations also turn, in part, on its graduation rates, which\ndecline when students drop out or age out at 21.\n       Actual enrollment at Phoenix hasn’t been a smooth\nprocess for these plaintiffs. While the School District\nunilaterally assigned them to Phoenix under the mandatory\nenrollment rule, their actual placement there proved far more\ndifficult. They experienced significant delays between when\nthey applied for enrollment and when they were either\nallowed to attend Phoenix or denied enrollment outright. The\nDistrict Court said it well: In “no case” did the School District\n“accomplish the enrollment of the plaintiffs within the five-\nday period mandated by state law.” Issa, 2016 WL 4493202,\nat *2. Iang and Sung were not permitted to start at Phoenix\nuntil December 2015 and February 2016, though they\nenrolled in November 2015. Issa enrolled in November 2015\nbut wasn’t allowed to start at Phoenix until February 2016.\nHassan was initially denied enrollment outright. He was later\nenrolled when the School District learned he was 17, not 19, a\nfactor with “no legal significance” under Pennsylvania law.\nId. And by when the injunction issued in late-August 2016,\nthe School District had yet to enroll Alembe Dunia, despite\n\n\n\n                               11\n\fhis “repeated attempts to enroll dating back to at least January\n2015.” Id.\n       How Attending Phoenix Affected the Plaintiffs\n       For those plaintiffs ultimately admitted to Phoenix, a\n“common complaint” was that they didn’t understand the\n“vast majority” of content taught in their non-ESL classes.\nIssa, 2016 WL 4493202, at *3. The plaintiffs all testified—\nthrough interpreters—that Phoenix’s accelerated curriculum\nmoved too quickly for them to grasp. Apart from their\nPhoenix ESL courses, the plaintiffs explained, they couldn’t\nunderstand most of what their teachers and classmates were\nsaying. Despite these difficulties, they accrued credits and\nadvanced to higher grade levels.\n       Through her interpreter, Issa testified that Phoenix’s\nclasses went “very fast” and she didn’t “understand\nanything.” J.A. 572–73. She felt she wasn’t “benefiting” there\nand wanted to attend a school “slower in pace.” J.A. 573.\nWhen asked, she couldn’t explain what two of her classes\nwere about. In those classes, she said, her teachers and\nclassmates spoke and wrote only in English, which she\ncouldn’t understand. Nevertheless, she was promoted to the\nnext grade. Of eighty-four students in her class, she was\nranked first.\n       Hassan testified through his interpreter that learning at\nPhoenix was “impossible” and he only understood his ESL\nteacher. J.A. 580. He couldn’t understand his content-class\nteachers or classmates.\n       Through their interpreter, Iang and Sung explained\nthey too had great difficulty understanding their content\nclasses at Phoenix because they were all taught in English.\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fThey couldn’t understand their teachers or classmates, and\nthere were “never” interpreters there to help. J.A. 558.\n       Anyemu Dunia graduated from Phoenix during the\nevidentiary hearing, earning a diploma in just sixteen months.\nHe did so although he arrived in the United States without\nany academic credits or English-language proficiency, all\nwhile amassing forty-seven total absences. Despite his\n“readily apparent difficulties conversing in English” and his\ntestimony that Phoenix’s classes moved too “fast” for him, he\ngraduated sixth in his class of 107. Issa, 2016 WL 4493202,\nat *3 & n.2; see J.A. 620, 1357.\n                              B\n       In July 2016, the plaintiffs sued the School District in\nthe District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nrequesting a preliminary injunction allowing them and\nsimilarly situated ELLs to enroll in and attend McCaskey. On\nbehalf of a putative class, they allege violations of the EEOA,\n20 U.S.C. § 1703(f); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.; the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due\nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses; and 24 Pa. Stat. § 13-\n1301 of the Pennsylvania Public School Code of 1949 and\nvarious Pennsylvania regulations.\n       Following expedited discovery on the plaintiffs’\npreliminary-injunction motion, the District Court held a five-\nday evidentiary hearing. Eighteen witnesses testified and\ndozens of exhibits were entered into evidence. The plaintiffs’\nexpert, Dr. Helaine Marshall, a specialist in teaching English\nto speakers of other languages (TESOL) and teaching ESL to\nSLIFE, testified at length.\n        On August 26, 2016, the District Court granted the\nplaintiffs’ preliminary-injunction motion, finding likely\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\fviolations of the EEOA and state law. Issa, 2016 WL\n4493202; see Order, 2016 WL 4493201.4 On the plaintiffs’\nEEOA claims, the District Court held that the School District\nfailed on prongs one and three of the three-part test penned in\nCastaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1009–10 (5th Cir. 1981),\na case we discuss in detail below. On their state law claims,\nthe District Court found likely violations of the Public School\nCode and regulations in light of the School District’s\nenrollment delays. It entered the following order:\n         [P]ending final resolution of this matter, the\n         school district shall:\n          1. Enroll and permit the school-age plaintiffs,\n          who so wish, to attend the main high school,\n          McCaskey, beginning on August 29, 2016;\n          2. Ensure that all plaintiffs are properly\n          assessed for language proficiency and receive\n          an appropriate and adequate program of\n          language instruction, including assignment to\n          the International School if appropriate, ESL\n          instruction, modifications in the delivery of\n          instruction and testing to facilitate their\n          achievement of English proficiency and state\n          academic standards, and interpretation and\n          translation services, as required by law, to\n          enable the plaintiffs and their parents to\n\n     4\n       The District Court found it “unnecessary” to address\nthe plaintiffs’ “Title VI and constitutional claims” because\nrelief granted on the EEOA and state law claims was\n“sufficient to resolve” the preliminary-injunction motion.\nIssa, 2016 WL 4493202, at *4. That conclusion is\nunchallenged on appeal.\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f        meaningfully      participate   in    education\n        decisions;\n        3. Ensure that the plaintiffs have equal access\n        to the full range of educational opportunities\n        provided to their peers, including curricular\n        and non-curricular programs and activities;\n        and\n        4. The plaintiffs shall post a nominal bond of\n        $1.00.\nOrder, 2016 WL 4493201, at *1. The District Court deferred\ndeciding the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification but\nurged the School District to “fairly apply” its preliminary-\ninjunction order to “school-age refugees similarly situated” to\nthe plaintiffs in “language proficiency.” Id. at *1 n.1.\n        The School District filed this timely appeal, asking our\nCourt to stay the injunction’s enforcement. It informed us\nthat, as of September 16, 2016, four of six named plaintiffs—\nexcluding Alembe and Anyemu Dunia—and five similarly\nsituated ELLs transferred to the International School after the\ninjunction issued, one of whom requested reinstatement at\nPhoenix. Appellant’s Resp. to Sep. 16, 2016 Order 1; see\nsupra note 2. Later, our Court denied the School District’s\nstay motion and ordered expedited briefing. The United States\nDepartment of Justice filed an amicus brief supporting the\nplaintiffs.\n                              II\n       The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§\n1331 and 1367(a). We have jurisdiction over this\ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). D.M. v.\nN.J. Dep’t of Educ., 801 F.3d 205, 211 (3d Cir. 2015).\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\f        At the outset, we underscore the School District’s\nheavy burden on appeal. In reviewing a preliminary-\ninjunction order, findings of fact are assessed for clear error,\nlegal conclusions are reviewed de novo, and the ultimate\ndecision to grant relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\nDel. Strong Families v. Attorney Gen. of Del., 793 F.3d 304,\n308 (3d Cir. 2015). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous only\nif it’s “completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support\ndisplaying some hue of credibility or bears no rational\nrelationship to the supportive evidentiary data.” Havens v.\nMobex Network Servs., LLC, 820 F.3d 80, 92 (3d Cir. 2016)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). An abuse of discretion\noccurs only if the decision reviewed rests upon a clearly\nerroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law, or an\nimproper application of law to fact. Mancini v. Northampton\nCty., 836 F.3d 308, 314 (3d Cir. 2016). With these principles\nin mind, we turn to the legal standards for the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction.\n                              III\n       A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy\ngranted in limited circumstances. Ferring Pharm., Inc. v.\nWatson Pharm., Inc., 765 F.3d 205, 210 (3d Cir. 2014).\nThose seeking one must establish that (A) they are likely to\nsucceed on the merits of their claims, (B) they are likely to\nsuffer irreparable harm without relief, (C) the balance of\nharms favors them, and (D) relief is in the public interest. Id.\nWe address each element seriatim.\n                               A\n       We turn first to whether the plaintiffs demonstrated a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their EEOA and state\nlaw claims. To satisfy this requirement for preliminary relief,\nthe movant need only prove a “prima facie case,” not a\n\n\n\n                              16\n\f“certainty” she’ll win. Highmark, Inc. v. UPMC Health Plan,\nInc., 276 F.3d 160, 173 (3d Cir. 2001). We do not require that\nthe right to a final decision after trial be “wholly without\ndoubt”; the movant need only show a “reasonable\nprobability” of success. Punnett v. Carter, 621 F.2d 578, 583\n(3d Cir. 1980) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Singer\nMgmt. Consultants, Inc. v. Milgram, 650 F.3d 223, 229 (3d\nCir. 2011) (en banc). We address the plaintiffs’ EEOA claims\nfirst, followed by their state law claims.\n                               1\n        This appeal requires us to interpret § 1703(f) of the\nEEOA, a provision we’ve never addressed and that the\nSupreme Court and our fellow Courts of Appeals have\ninfrequently applied. We start where we always do when\ninterpreting a statute: with its text. Passed in 1974 as a floor\namendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\nof 1965, the EEOA states in § 1703(f) that “[n]o State shall\ndeny equal educational opportunity to an individual on\naccount of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by\n. . . the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate\naction to overcome language barriers that impede equal\nparticipation by its students in its instructional programs.” 20\nU.S.C. § 1703(f). An “individual” denied an equal\neducational opportunity may bring a civil action in federal\ncourt “against such parties, and for such relief, as may be\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fappropriate.”5 Id. § 1706. The EEOA limits court-ordered\nremedies to those that are “‘essential to correct particular\ndenials of equal educational opportunity.’” Horne v. Flores,\n557 U.S. 433, 450 (2009) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1712).\n       Based upon these provisions, we hold that an\nindividual alleging a violation of § 1703(f) must satisfy four\nelements: (1) the defendant must be an educational agency,\n(2) the plaintiff must face language barriers impeding her\nequal participation in the defendant’s instructional programs,\n(3) the defendant must have failed to take appropriate action\nto overcome those barriers, and (4) the plaintiff must have\nbeen denied equal educational opportunity on account of her\n\n\n\n\n     5\n         We note there’s no dispute the plaintiffs are\n“individuals” under the EEOA, their refugee status\nnotwithstanding. The EEOA was “enacted pursuant to § 5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment,” Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433,\n440 n.1 (2009) (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1), (b)), and\nentitles “all children enrolled in public schools” equal\neducational opportunity, 20 U.S.C. § 1701(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded). It is well established that the Fourteenth Amendment\nguarantees immigrant children, whatever their legal status,\nequal access to public education. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,\n216–24 (1982).\n\n\n\n\n                             18\n\frace, color, sex, or national origin. See 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f);\nid. § 1720(a) (defining “educational agency”).6\n        Here, there is no dispute the plaintiffs satisfied §\n1703(f)’s first element. The School District does not quibble\nwith the District Court’s conclusion that it is an “educational\nagency” under §§ 1703(f) and 1720(a). See Issa, 2016 WL\n4493202, at *1 & n.1. We see no reason to disturb that\nconclusion on appeal, as the EEOA expressly contemplates\n“local educational agencies,” like the School District, in\ndefining an “educational agency.” 20 U.S.C. § 1720(a); see\nid. § 7801(30)(A).\n\n\n\n     6\n       The District Court said that to prevail under § 1703(f),\na plaintiff need only show “(1) language barriers; (2)\ndefendant’s failure to take appropriate action to overcome\nthese barriers; and (3) a resulting impediment to students’\nequal participation in instructional programs.” Issa, 2016 WL\n4493202, at *5. It relied on a Middle District of Pennsylvania\ndecision to so hold. Id. (citing CG v. Pa. Dep’t of Educ., 888\nF. Supp. 2d 534, 575 (M.D. Pa. 2012)). We affirmed\njudgment in CG but had no occasion to reach the EEOA\nclaims at issue there. CG v. Pa. Dep’t of Educ., 734 F.3d 229\n(3d Cir. 2013). Addressing § 1703(f) directly here for the first\ntime, we find this three-element test incomplete. It ignores §\n1703(f)’s “educational agency” and “on account of”\nlanguage. The four-element test we set forth above gives\nproper effect to all of § 1703(f)’s text, as required. See Corley\nv. United States, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009) (stating that a\nstatute “should be construed so that effect is given to all its\nprovisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,\nvoid or insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n\n\n                               19\n\f        Likewise, there is no genuine dispute the plaintiffs\nsatisfied § 1703(f)’s second element. The record here is\nreplete with evidence the named plaintiffs, all SLIFE, face\nformidable language barriers. All testified through\ninterpreters that they couldn’t understand their content\ncourses taught in English at Phoenix. Given this evidence, we\nagree the plaintiffs demonstrated language barriers impeding\ntheir equal participation in the School District’s instructional\nprograms, satisfying § 1703(f)’s second element. See Issa,\n2016 WL 4493202, at *7 n.5 (stating that the parties “do not\ndispute” the plaintiffs’ language barriers and crediting the\nplaintiffs’ testimony that “their participation was impeded”).\n       Because elements one and two of § 1703(f)’s prima\nfacie case are met, we move to § 1703(f)’s more difficult\nthird and fourth elements.\n  Section 1703(f)’s Third Element: “Appropriate Action”\n       To satisfy § 1703(f)’s third element in the context of a\npreliminary-injunction motion, the plaintiffs must adduce\nevidence of a reasonable probability that the School District\nfailed to take “appropriate action” to “overcome” their\nlanguage barriers. Because the EEOA itself doesn’t define\n“appropriate action,” we must look elsewhere for guidance.\n        We turn first to the Supreme Court’s decision in Lau v.\nNichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), issued just before Congress\npassed the EEOA. There, a school district failed to provide\nany English-language instruction to a significant number\n(about 60 percent) of its Chinese students. Id. at 564. Those\nstudents filed suit, alleging violations of Title VI, which\nrestricts federal funding for entities that discriminate based on\nrace, color, or national origin. Id. at 565. Finding adequate\nproof of a Title VI violation, the Court stressed the\nimportance of language instruction in American education.\n\n\n\n                               20\n\f       There is no equality of treatment merely by\n       providing students with the same facilities,\n       textbooks, teachers, and curriculum; for\n       students who do not understand English are\n       effectively foreclosed from any meaningful\n       education. Basic English skills are at the very\n       core of what . . . public schools teach.\n       Imposition of a requirement that, before a child\n       can effectively participate in the educational\n       program, he must already have acquired those\n       basic skills is to make a mockery of public\n       education. We know that those who do not\n       understand English are certain to find their\n       classroom          experiences           wholly\n       incomprehensible and in no way meaningful.\nId. at 566. Because no “specific remedy” was requested, the\nCourt left that question open, suggesting the school district\nhad latitude to decide how it would comply with Title VI:\n“Teaching English to the students of Chinese ancestry who do\nnot speak the language is one choice. Giving instructions to\nthis group in Chinese is another. There may be others.” Id. at\n564–65.\n        Lau’s pronouncements about Title VI were later called\ninto question, and the Supreme Court ultimately recognized\nits abrogation on that ground. See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532\nU.S. 275, 285 (2001) (“[W]e have since rejected Lau’s\ninterpretation of [Title VI.]”). In enacting § 1703(f), however,\nCongress embraced Lau’s “essential holding” that “schools\nare not free to ignore the need of limited English speaking\nchildren for language assistance.” Castaneda, 648 F.2d at\n1008.\n\n\n\n\n                              21\n\f       Following Lau and § 1703(f)’s enactment, the Fifth\nCircuit handed down Castaneda v. Pickard in 1981. Claiming\nviolations of § 1703(f), Mexican-American students sued\ntheir school district, alleging its failure to implement a\nbilingual-education program impeded their ability to\novercome language barriers. Id. at 992. Measuring § 1703(f)’s\nreach, the Fifth Circuit found that by using the “less specific\nterm, ‘appropriate action,’” Congress left state and local\nauthorities a “substantial amount of latitude” to choose the\n“programs and techniques they would use” to satisfy §\n1703(f)’s mandate. Id. at 1008. But too much latitude, the\ncourt cautioned, would render § 1703(f) a nullity.\nAccordingly, the Fifth Circuit held that state educational\nagencies must make a “genuine and good faith effort,\nconsistent with local circumstances and resources, to remedy\nthe language deficiencies of their students” under § 1703(f),\nand noted that Congress “deliberately placed on federal courts\nthe difficult responsibility of determining whether that\nobligation [is] met.” Id. at 1009. Without guidance from\nCongress on what “appropriate action” looks like, however,\nthe Fifth Circuit found itself, like we are now,\n      confronted with a type of task which federal\n      courts are ill-equipped to perform and which we\n      are often criticized for undertaking—\n      prescribing substantive standards and policies\n      for institutions whose governance is properly\n      reserved to other levels and branches of our\n      government (i.e., state and local educational\n      agencies) which are better able to assimilate and\n      assess the knowledge of professionals in the\n      field.\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\fId. Nevertheless, the court charted a path forward, fashioning\na “mode of analysis” to fulfill the responsibility Congress\nreposed in the federal courts under § 1703(f) without “unduly\nsubstituting” its “educational values and theories” for the\n“educational and political decisions” reserved to state and\nlocal school authorities and the “expert knowledge of\neducators.” Id. That “mode of analysis,” it said, is threefold.\nFirst, courts\n       examine carefully the evidence the record\n       contains concerning the soundness of the\n       educational theory or principles upon which the\n       challenged program is based. This, of course, is\n       not to be done with any eye toward discerning\n       the relative merits of sound but competing\n       bodies of expert educational opinion . . . . The\n       court’s responsibility . . . is only to ascertain\n       that a school system is [pursuing] a program\n       informed by an educational theory recognized\n       as sound by some experts in the field or, at\n       least, deemed a legitimate experimental\n       strategy.\nId. Second, courts determine whether the programs and\npractices “actually used” by the school system are\n“reasonably calculated to implement effectively the\neducational theory adopted by the school.” Id. at 1010. And\nthird, if an otherwise-sound and effectively-implemented\nprogram fails to “produce results” indicating that language\nbarriers are “actually being overcome,” it may “no longer\nconstitute appropriate action.” Id. Applying this test, the Fifth\nCircuit found “serious doubts” under prong two about the\nlanguage competency of teachers employed in the school\n\n\n\n\n                               23\n\fdistrict’s bilingual classrooms and remanded for an\nevidentiary hearing. Id. at 1012–13, 1015.\n       Courts have consistently followed Castaneda’s\napproach to apply § 1703(f)’s third element, requiring\n“appropriate action.” See, e.g., United States v. Texas, 601\nF.3d 354, 365–73 (5th Cir. 2010); Mumid v. Abraham Lincoln\nHigh Sch., 618 F.3d 789, 796 (8th Cir. 2010); Gomez v. Ill.\nState Bd. of Educ., 811 F.2d 1030, 1037, 1040–42 (7th Cir.\n1987); United States v. Texas, 680 F.2d 356, 371 (5th Cir.\n1982). And in Horne v. Flores, the Supreme Court relied on\nCastaneda to apply § 1703(f), 557 U.S. at 440–41, 454–55,\nthough it did not adopt the Fifth Circuit’s test explicitly, id. at\n458 n.8 (expressing no view on “whether or not this test\nprovides much concrete guidance regarding the meaning of\n‘appropriate action’”). Given these decisions and the parties’\nagreement that Castaneda should here guide our analysis, we\nwill apply the Fifth Circuit’s three-part test. Though we\ndecline to adopt “without qualification” Castaneda’s\nframework and think “fine tuning must await future cases,”\nwe believe this test, as a general matter, properly balances §\n1703(f)’s “allocation of responsibilities between the courts\nand the schools” and hence provides a “fruitful starting point”\nfor our analysis under § 1703(f)’s third element. Gomez, 811\nF.2d at 1041.\n        Applying Castaneda here to resolve whether the\nSchool District took “appropriate action” to overcome the\nplaintiffs’ language barriers under § 1703(f), we agree with\n\n\n\n\n                                24\n\fthe District Court: The School District foundered on\nCastaneda’s first and third prongs. We explain why below.7\n                    Castaneda Prong One\n       On Castaneda’s first prong—satisfied where an\neducational agency fails to pursue a program informed by an\neducational theory recognized as sound by some experts in\nthe field—the plaintiffs showed a reasonable probability of\nsuccess. Their expert, Dr. Marshall, testified consistently and\nat length that Phoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program\nfor ELLs is unsound for SLIFE (again, students with limited\nor interrupted formal education). The plaintiffs and two\nformer Phoenix teachers corroborated her testimony. The\nSchool District did not rebut it with another expert or through\ncontrary research. We see no clear error here.\n      SLIFE, Dr. Marshall emphasized, generally struggle or\nhave yet to learn to read or write in any language, including\n\n     7\n        Because the District Court concluded Phoenix’s\naccelerated, non-sheltered program doesn’t satisfy\nCastaneda’s first and third prongs, it didn’t address\nCastaneda’s second prong—whether the programs and\npractices actually used by the School District are reasonably\ncalculated to implement effectively the educational theory\nadopted. This wasn’t error. The District Court was right that\nCastaneda’s test is “conjunctive.” Issa, 2016 WL 4493202, at\n*6. All three prongs must be met for an educational agency’s\nprogram to satisfy § 1703(f)’s “appropriate action” element.\nSee Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1009–10. While we thank the\nUnited States as amicus curiae for its thoughtful analysis of\nCastaneda’s second prong, given the plaintiffs’ successful\nshowings under prongs one and three, we need not and do not\nreach Castaneda’s second prong here.\n\n\n\n                              25\n\ftheir native languages. Not only must they learn English in\nAmerican schools, she explained, they must learn how to\nlearn there. See J.A. 651 (“[W]e have to teach [SLIFE] for\nthe first time how to read in a language that isn’t even a\nlanguage they speak yet.”); J.A. 652 (describing how teaching\nin the United States relies on “decontextualized tasks”—\nmultiple choice, matching, and true-false questions—that\nforeign students are “completely unaware of”). Dr. Marshall\nsaid that for SLIFE to succeed, teaching must “go more\nslowly and build, build the language, build the literacy,” and\n“fill in the gaps.” J.A. 656. This testimony went\nunchallenged.\n        Given SLIFE’s need for unhurried and deliberate\nliteracy and language development, Dr. Marshall opined that\nPhoenix’s accelerated curriculum is “totally inappropriate”\nfor them. Id.; see J.A. 671 (“For SLIFE . . . it is\ncontraindicated. It is the opposite of what they need.”).\nStudents like the plaintiffs who are “behind academically”\nand “don’t understand English,” she explained, “cannot be\nexpected to go faster through content when they haven’t\nreached a threshold of English.” J.A. 656. Her view, she\nattested, accords with those of other experts in the field. She\nwas unaware of any contrary research, and the School District\ndidn’t point to any. “Uniformly,” she said, “the field in\ntalking about [SLIFE] talks about going more slowly,\nbuilding in redundancy, building in repetition, and having\nthem become familiar with material in many different ways in\norder for them to learn it, and not to go at double time.” Id.\n(emphasis added); see J.A. 658 (“Again and again they say\nthe key is to take your time, present [the material] in a variety\nof ways, make sure they get it . . . and nobody is talking about\naccelerating.”). No evidence was presented that an\n\n\n\n\n                               26\n\faccelerated curriculum, on its own, is accepted as sound\neducational theory for SLIFE.\n       Dr. Marshall also opined consistently that “sheltered\ninstruction” content classes, like those offered at the\nInternational School, are “needed” for SLIFE, J.A. 661–63,\n667, and that Phoenix’s commingling of SLIFE with higher-\nlevel ELLs and native English speakers, when combined with\naccelerated content courses, is not accepted as sound\neducational theory, J.A. 666 (“[I]f you’re going to try and\nhave newcomers with very little English . . . mixed in with\nfluid English speakers . . . what happens is that it becomes\noverwhelming for the lower level ELLs.”); see J.A. 667\n(“SLIFE need an entire day of instruction that’s tailored to\nthem.”); J.A. 669 (“[W]hen [SLIFE are] in their content\nclasses with native speakers . . . they’re not understanding\nwhat’s happening, they’re really not progressing, they’re not\nmoving forward . . . [b]ecause they’re not actually learning\nthe material.”). Here too, no evidence was adduced that\naccelerated, unsheltered instruction is accepted as sound\neducational theory for SLIFE. The plaintiffs’ own testimony,\ncited extensively above, confirmed their great difficulty in\nunderstanding their accelerated, non-sheltered content classes\nat Phoenix.\n       Former Phoenix teacher Jandy Rivera reinforced Dr.\nMarshall’s and the plaintiffs’ testimony, explaining that her\n“refugee students” were “not able to master the material” in\nPhoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program. J.A. 633. She\nstated that “[a]t the fast pace and atmosphere at Phoenix,”\nrefugee students were “not able to learn”; that these students\n“needed a regularly paced atmosphere, or perhaps even an\nextended learning atmosphere in order to master the\nmaterial”; and that in her experience, Phoenix’s program\n\n\n\n\n                             27\n\f“didn’t work” for newly arrived ELLs. Id. Phoenix’s lead-\nESL teacher, Marianne Ortiz, similarly corroborated Dr.\nMarshall’s testimony, stating that the International School is a\n“better placement for entering students” because it’s not\n“accelerated” and gives ELLs “sheltered [instruction] content\nclasses.” J.A. 837. Given this evidence, we see no clear error\nin the District Court’s findings that\n       [w]hen a student with no ability to speak or\n       understand English, such as the plaintiffs, is\n       placed in accelerated classes, the student will\n       cover material twice as fast as a normal school,\n       but that material is also taught in a language\n       that student does not understand. On its face,\n       this practice appears to be counterintuitive;\n       expert testimony confirmed that the practice\n       was unsound . . . . The District did not offer any\n       expert to the contrary. Instead, the District\n       offered its ESL Coordinator [Amber Hilt], who\n       testified that the “structured immersion”\n       technique is a sound theory generally for\n       overcoming language barriers, but nothing\n       persuasive to the court to contradict Dr.\n       Marshall’s testimony that this technique was\n       not recognized as sound for an accelerated,\n       credit-recovery program. The Phoenix model of\n       accelerated    learning     presents      different\n       language barriers than a traditional education\n       program, and is particularly imposing for\n       students who cannot yet understand the\n       language in which the courses are taught.\nIssa, 2016 WL 4493202, at *3, *6 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f       On appeal, the School District attempts merely to\nimpeach the credibility of Dr. Marshall’s testimony. It points\nout, for example, that Dr. Marshall “neglected” to “personally\nobserve” Phoenix’s “classrooms/environments,” although\nRivera and Ortiz and all six named plaintiffs reinforced her\ntestimony. Appellant’s Br. 43. It says Dr. Marshall was a\nmere “teacher of teachers,” not an ESL instructor, without\nexplaining why that might render the District Court’s reliance\non her testimony clearly erroneous. Id. And it says Dr.\nMarshall contradicted herself when she testified that\n“immersion” of ELLs in content classes with native speakers\nimpeded their progress, not necessarily acceleration. Id. at 44.\nBut when we consider the record en bloc, these alleged\nblemishes in Dr. Marshall’s testimony fail to persuade us that\nthe District Court’s findings are “completely devoid of\nminimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of\ncredibility” or bear “no rational relationship to the supportive\nevidentiary data,” as required to show clear error. Havens,\n820 F.3d at 92 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n       For these reasons, the District Court did not err in\nconcluding that the plaintiffs showed a reasonable probability\nthat Phoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program isn’t\ninformed by an educational theory recognized as sound by\nsome experts in the field, as required under Castaneda’s first\nprong.\n                   Castaneda Prong Three\n       On Castaneda’s third prong—satisfied where an\neducational agency’s programs fail to produce results\nindicating that language barriers are actually being\novercome—we agree with the District Court that the plaintiffs\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success. The evidence shows\nthat the School District doesn’t keep separate data on the\n\n\n\n                              29\n\fefficacy of Phoenix’s ESL program. This rendered it difficult,\nif not impossible, for the District Court to ascertain whether\nthe plaintiffs’ language barriers were actually being overcome\nat Phoenix. Given this evidence, we see no clear error in the\nDistrict Court’s findings, unchallenged on appeal, that\n       [u]ndisputed testimony offered in court shows\n       that the District does not evaluate whether the\n       “language barriers confronting students are\n       actually being overcome” at Phoenix [as\n       required by Castaneda]. The ESL Coordinator\n       [Hilt] acknowledged that “there is no data . . .\n       that would allow us to determine whether . . .\n       the ESL delivered to these students in . . .\n       Phoenix[’s] accelerated model is working or\n       not.” [J.A. 734.] Because the District did not\n       disaggregate the Phoenix data to make this\n       assessment, it could not demonstrate the\n       effectiveness of the program to the court.\n       Through her own efforts, Dr. Marshall was able\n       to discern from limited data provided by the\n       District that Phoenix’s performance on literacy\n       measures—the core measure of “overcoming\n       language barriers”—was far worse than\n       McCaskey’s.\nIssa, 2016 WL 4493202, at *6. The School District’s\nSuperintendent, Dr. Damaris Rau, confirmed that the\neffectiveness of Phoenix’s ESL program had yet to be\nevaluated. J.A. 746–47. This further supports the District\nCourt’s findings.\n       On appeal, the School District argues Phoenix’s ESL\ninstruction “is and continues to be successful.” Appellant’s\nBr. 44. To bolster that point, it notes that one named plaintiff,\n\n\n\n                               30\n\fAnyemu Dunia, graduated from Phoenix and read an essay\naloud in court, while “many” other unspecified ELLs have\ngone on to college after graduating Phoenix. Id. (citing J.A.\n627). Though he could read an essay aloud in court, the\nDistrict Court found that Anyemu had “readily apparent\ndifficulties conversing in English,” Issa, 2016 WL 4493202,\nat *3 n.2, and Anyemu himself testified that he could only\n“catch . . . some word[s]” when his English-speaking teachers\ntalked to him in class, J.A. 620. Even if we were to accept this\nas sufficient indicia of Anyemu’s progress, his ability to read\na portion of an essay in court says nothing about whether the\nother four named plaintiffs were overcoming their own\nlanguage barriers at Phoenix. The record here amply supports\nthe District Court’s conclusion that they were not. As\nexplained before, all testified they couldn’t understand what\ntheir teachers and classmates were saying in their content\nclasses at Phoenix. This argument therefore fails to show\nclear error.\n        We also find unavailing the School District’s\ncontention, in its papers and at oral argument, that an ELL’s\nability to graduate Phoenix, on its own, weighs in the School\nDistrict’s favor under § 1703(f). On this record, we see little\nevidence of a meaningful connection between ELLs\ngraduating from Phoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered\nprogram and ELLs actually overcoming their language\nbarriers there. On the contrary, there is ample evidence\nsupporting the District Court’s finding that “[a]lthough the\nstudent earns (or at least is issued) a diploma and all of the\nattendant benefits, the student will likely graduate [Phoenix]\nwith limited ability, if any, to converse in English—also often\na prerequisite to future advancement—and limited\nunderstanding of the content of the courses he actually took.”\nIssa, 2016 WL 4493202, at *3. We therefore conclude that\n\n\n\n                              31\n\fthe plaintiffs showed a likelihood that Phoenix’s program\nfails to produce results indicating that their language barriers\nare actually being overcome, as required under Castaneda’s\nthird prong.\n      Because the plaintiffs showed a likelihood of success\nunder Castaneda’s three-part test, they met § 1703(f)’s third\nelement, requiring proof that the School District failed to take\n“appropriate action” to “overcome” their language barriers.\n   Section 1703(f)’s Fourth Element: “On Account of” a\n                  Protected Characteristic\n        We now address § 1703(f)’s fourth and final element,\nwhich requires proof the plaintiffs were denied equal\neducational opportunity on account of their race, color, sex,\nor national origin. See 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f). We hold they met\nthis element.\n      The Supreme Court has yet to address how the\npreamble to § 1703, which includes the “on account of”\nlanguage here in issue, interacts with the rest of § 1703 and\nsubsection (f) in particular. The Court did not discuss the\nmatter in Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, so we look\nelsewhere. In its entirety, § 1703 provides that\n       [n]o State shall deny equal educational\n       opportunity to an individual on account of his\n       or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by—\n        (a) the deliberate segregation by an\n        educational agency of students on the basis of\n        race, color, or national origin among or within\n        schools;\n\n\n\n\n                              32\n\f(b) the failure of an educational agency which\nhas formerly practiced such deliberate\nsegregation to take affirmative steps,\nconsistent with part 4 of this subchapter, to\nremove the vestiges of a dual school system;\n(c) the assignment by an educational agency of\na student to a school, other than the one closest\nto his or her place of residence within the\nschool district in which he or she resides, if the\nassignment results in a greater degree of\nsegregation of students on the basis of race,\ncolor, sex, or national origin among the\nschools of such agency than would result if\nsuch student were assigned to the school\nclosest to his or her place of residence within\nthe school district of such agency providing\nthe appropriate grade level and type of\neducation for such student;\n(d) discrimination by an educational agency\non the basis of race, color, or national origin in\nthe employment, employment conditions, or\nassignment to schools of its faculty or staff,\nexcept to fulfill the purposes of subsection (f)\nbelow;\n(e) the transfer by an educational agency,\nwhether voluntary or otherwise, of a student\nfrom one school to another if the purpose and\neffect of such transfer is to increase\nsegregation of students on the basis of race,\ncolor, or national origin among the schools of\nsuch agency; or\n\n\n\n\n                      33\n\f         (f) the failure by an educational agency to take\n         appropriate action to overcome language\n         barriers that impede equal participation by its\n         students in its instructional programs.\n        The School District suggests § 1703’s preamble\nrequires the plaintiffs to prove it failed to take appropriate\naction to overcome their language barriers on account of their\nnational origins under § 1703(f). The School District\ninterprets “on account of” to require a showing of intentional\ndiscrimination, contending there’s insufficient evidence the\nplaintiffs’ national origins “motivated their placement at\nPhoenix.” Reply Br. 3–4.8 We reject this reading of § 1703.\n       We start with what § 1703(f) doesn’t require when\nread together with § 1703’s “on account of” language: a\nshowing of discrimination of any kind, intentional or\notherwise, on account of an EEOA-protected characteristic.\nCongress expressly included the word “discrimination” in §\n\n\n     8\n        The School District raised this argument only in\npassing in the District Court and for the first time on appeal in\nits reply brief. We could therefore consider it waived. See\nPrometheus Radio Project v. FCC, 824 F.3d 33, 53 (3d Cir.\n2016) (arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are\nwaived on appeal); P.R.B.A. Corp. v. HMS Host Toll Roads,\nInc., 808 F.3d 221, 224 n.1 (3d Cir. 2015) (arguments not\nsquarely put before the district court are waived on appeal).\nBut the School District’s “on account of” argument turns on a\npure question of law about a matter of public importance, so\nwe’ll exercise our discretion to consider it. See Huber v.\nTaylor, 469 F.3d 67, 74 (3d Cir. 2006); Bagot v. Ashcroft, 398\nF.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir. 2005); Loretangeli v. Critelli, 853 F.2d\n186, 190 n.5 (3d Cir. 1988).\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f1703(d) but omitted it from § 1703(f). See Castaneda, 648\nF.2d at 1007–08. And in subsections (a) and (e) of § 1703,\nCongress explicitly required showings of “deliberate” and\n“purpose[ful]” conduct, but merely required proof of a\n“fail[ure]” to take appropriate action under § 1703(f). See id.\nWhere Congress “includes particular language in one section\nof a statute”—here, the word “discrimination” and language\nconnoting intentional conduct in subsections (a), (d), and\n(e)—but “omits it in another section of the same Act”—here,\nsubsection (f)—we presume it acted “intentionally and\npurposely” in so doing. Dean v. United States, 556 U.S. 568,\n573 (2009); see Bd. of Trustees of IBT Local 863 Pension\nFund v. C & S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 802 F.3d 534, 545\n(3d Cir. 2015). We therefore join the Fifth Circuit in holding\nthat § 1703(f) prohibits the mere failure by an educational\nagency to take appropriate action to overcome students’\nlanguage barriers, “regardless of whether such a failure is\nmotivated by an intent to discriminate against those students.”\nCastaneda, 648 F.2d at 1008. And we add that, because §\n1703(f) doesn’t say “discrimination,” there’s no requirement\nunder it to prove discrimination of any kind, including, for\nexample, disparate impact discrimination.9 This reading\n\n     9\n       The School District’s argument is premised on the\nnotion that “on account of” in § 1703’s preamble not only\nmodifies the denial of “equal educational opportunity” but\nalso the particular state action or inaction proscribed in each\nof § 1703’s subsections. The statute’s language, however,\ndoesn’t support that reading. The preamble merely states a\ngeneral prohibition on the denial of equal educational\nopportunity “on account of” a protected characteristic\nviolated per se “by” the state acting or failing to act in\naccordance with subsections (a) through (f). Each subsection\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fthus creates a separate cause of action for the denial of equal\neducational opportunity on account of an EEOA-protected\ncharacteristic, and none requires proof that the state’s action\nor inaction was itself “on account of” such a characteristic.\n      The School District’s reading also fails to distinguish\nbetween the phrase “on the basis of” a protected\ncharacteristic—which Congress has used traditionally and in\nthis very statute to designate discriminatory intent, see §§\n1702(a)(1), 1703(a), (e)—and the phrase “on account of” a\nprotected characteristic, which we presume, consistent with\nbasic canons of statutory construction, Congress used\nintentionally in § 1703’s preamble to convey a different\nmeaning. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 711 n.9\n(2004); William A. Graham Co. v. Haughey, 568 F.3d 425,\n435 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\n\n\n                              36\n\faccords with the Supreme Court’s observation in Horne, 557\nU.S. at 472, that § 1703(f) requires educational agencies to\n“tak[e] ‘appropriate action’ to teach English to students who\ngrew up speaking another language,” and with Lau’s\n“essential holding” that “schools are not free to ignore the\n\n\n\n\n       Further, as applied to § 1703’s other subsections, the\nSchool District’s “on account of” interpretation would violate\ntwo more canons of construction. First, it would render\nportions of § 1703(a), (c), and (d) superfluous by requiring a\nplaintiff to prove that the “segregation” or “discrimination”\nthese subsections already specify was “on the basis of race,\ncolor, or national origin” and “on account of race, color, sex,\nor national origin.” See Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S.\n561, 574 (1995); Zimmerman v. Norfolk S. Corp., 706 F.3d\n170, 185 (3d Cir. 2013). Second, it would render § 1703(b)\nand (e) nonsensical by requiring a plaintiff to establish both\nthat the state failed to affirmatively remediate the disparate\nimpact of past discrimination on the basis of race, color, or\nnational origin and that the failure itself was “on account of\n. . . race, color, sex, or national origin.” See Corley, 556 U.S.\nat 314; G.L. v. Ligonier Valley Sch. Dist. Auth., 802 F.3d 601,\n615 (3d Cir. 2015). We therefore reject the School District’s\nreading of § 1703’s “on account of” language.\n\n\n\n\n                               37\n\fneed of limited English speaking children for language\nassistance,” Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1008.10\n       We end with what § 1703(f) does require when read\ntogether with § 1703’s “on account of” language: a nexus\nbetween the lost educational opportunity alleged and an\nEEOA-protected characteristic. Stated differently, we hold\nthat the denial of the equal educational opportunity—in §\n1703(f)’s case, the language barrier that is not being\novercome—must stem from race, color, sex, or national\norigin, rather than from, for example, a cognitive disability\ncovered by a different remedial scheme, like the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.\nApplying this reading here, we conclude the record fully\nsupports that the plaintiffs’ language barriers, and hence their\n\n     10\n          The School District says the Eighth Circuit’s 2010\ndecision in Mumid v. Abraham Lincoln High School, 618\nF.3d 789, controls this issue. It doesn’t. Specifically, the\nSchool District points to Mumid’s statement that a “policy\nthat treats students with limited English proficiency\ndifferently than other students . . . does not facially\ndiscriminate based on national origin.” Id. at 795. The School\nDistrict omits, however, that the Eighth Circuit said that in\naddressing Title VI claims, not EEOA claims. See id. at 793–\n95. When the Court of Appeals dealt with the students’\nEEOA claims in Mumid, it did so on standing grounds, noting\nexpressly that it would “assume” without deciding that\nevidence of the school’s failure to take appropriate action to\novercome language barriers “could support a finding that the\nDistrict denied equal educational opportunity ‘on account of\n. . . national origin.’” Id. at 795–96 (emphasis added). Mumid\ntherefore doesn’t support—and actually hurts—the School\nDistrict’s position.\n\n\n\n                              38\n\flost educational opportunities, stem from their national\norigins.\n       Thus, the plaintiffs satisfied § 1703(f)’s fourth\nelement, as they were denied equal educational opportunity\n“on account of” an EEOA-protected characteristic: their\nnational origins. Given the plaintiffs’ successful showings\nunder all four of § 1703(f)’s elements, we agree with the\nDistrict Court that they demonstrated a likelihood of success\non their EEOA claims.\n                               2\n        We turn now to whether the plaintiffs demonstrated a\nreasonable probability of success on the merits of their state\nlaw claims. Because neither the plaintiffs nor the District\nCourt addressed the threshold question whether the plaintiffs’\nstate law claims are cognizable, we’ll remand for the District\nCourt to consider that question in the first instance.\n        In Pennsylvania, every child who hasn’t graduated\nfrom high school “may attend” the public schools in her\ndistrict until the end of the school year in which she turns 21.\n24 Pa. Stat. § 13-1301; see 22 Pa. Code §§ 11.12, 12.1(a). “A\nchild’s right to be admitted to school may not be conditioned\non the child’s immigration status.” 22 Pa. Code § 11.11(d). A\nschool district “shall normally enroll a child the next business\nday, but no later than [within] 5 business days of application.”\nId. § 11.11(b). The District Court concluded the plaintiffs\nshowed likely violations of these state laws because none was\nenrolled within five days and one—Alembe Dunia—was\n“still not enrolled” when the injunction issued. Issa, 2016 WL\n4493202, at *5.\n      While the School District’s enrollment delays are\nindeed troubling, we must conclude the District Court erred\n\n\n\n\n                              39\n\fas a matter of law in finding that the plaintiffs showed a\nlikelihood of success on their state law claims. Unlike the\nEEOA, which explicitly grants “individual[s]” the right to\n“institute a civil action” in court for equitable relief, 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1706, 1713, our de novo review reveals nothing in\n24 Pa. Stat. § 13-1301 or elsewhere in the Public School Code\nthat expressly grants individuals, like students or their\nparents, a private cause of action to enforce the statute in\ncourt through equitable remedies.11 See 24 Pa. Stat. §§ 1-101\nto 27-2702. Likewise, 22 Pa. Code § 11.11(b), a regulation\npromulgated by Pennsylvania’s State Board of Education,\ndoesn’t expressly grant private litigants a cause of action to\n\n\n     11\n          In its entirety, 24 Pa. Stat. § 13-1301 states that\n          [e]very child, being a resident of any school\n          district, between the ages of six (6) and twenty-\n          one (21) years, may attend the public schools in\n          his district, subject to the provisions of this act.\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of law to\n          the contrary, a child who attains the age of\n          twenty-one (21) years during the school term\n          and who has not graduated from high school\n          may continue to attend the public schools in his\n          district free of charge until the end of the school\n          term. The board of school directors of any\n          school district may admit to the schools of the\n          district, with or without the payment of tuition,\n          any non-resident child temporarily residing in\n          the district, and may require the attendance of\n          such non-resident child in the same manner and\n          on the same conditions as it requires the\n          attendance of a resident child.\n\n\n\n                                  40\n\fremedy enrollment delays or denials in court through\nequitable relief, assuming a regulation can ever do so under\nPennsylvania law.12\n        In the absence of an express private cause of action\nunder a Pennsylvania statute, we look to whether the statute\n“implicitly” creates one. Estate of Witthoeft v. Kiskaddon, 733\nA.2d 623, 626 (Pa. 1999) (emphasis added). When there’s\nsufficient indicia of the General Assembly’s intent,\nPennsylvania courts have recognized the possibility of\nimplied private causes of action and remedies stemming from\nstate statutes that don’t expressly provide for them. See, e.g.,\nSchappell v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co., 934 A.2d 1184, 1188–\n90 (Pa. 2007) (inferring a private cause of action from\nPennsylvania’s Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law);\nEstate of Witthoeft, 733 A.2d at 625–28 (declining to infer a\nprivate cause of action from Pennsylvania’s Motor Vehicle\n\n     12\n          In its entirety, 22 Pa. Code § 11.11(b) states that\n          [a] school district or charter school shall\n          normally enroll a child the next business day,\n          but no later than 5 business days of application.\n          The school district or charter school has no\n          obligation to enroll a child until the parent,\n          guardian or other person having control or\n          charge of the student making the application has\n          supplied proof of the child’s age, residence, and\n          immunizations as required by law. School\n          districts and charter schools receiving requests\n          for educational records from another school\n          district or charter school shall forward the\n          records within 10 business days of receipt of the\n          request.\n\n\n\n                                 41\n\fCode and regulations); Solomon v. U.S. Healthcare Sys. of\nPa., Inc., 797 A.2d 346, 352–53 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2002)\n(finding no implied private cause of action under\nPennsylvania’s Health Care Act). Here, to the extent\nPennsylvania decisions can be read to support an implied\nprivate cause of action, they suggest that exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies may be required in the first instance.\nSee Velazquez ex rel. Speaks-Velazquez v. E. Stroudsburg\nArea Sch. Dist., 949 A.2d 354, 360 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2008).\nBut neither the District Court nor the parties cited any\nauthority concerning the viability of an administrative\nexhaustion requirement or an implied private cause of action\nfor equitable relief stemming from the Pennsylvania statute\nand regulations in issue. The District Court thus implicitly\nassumed such a private cause of action and remedy may be so\ninferred without exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n        Without any briefing on these issues—which appear to\nbe matters of first impression under Pennsylvania law—we\ndecline to resolve them. We’ll leave them for the District\nCourt to address in the first instance on remand, assuming\nthey’re raised by the parties. See Young v. Martin, 801 F.3d\n172, 182 (3d Cir. 2015) (leaving legal questions not reached\nin the district court and not briefed on appeal “for the District\nCourt to address in the first instance on remand”). Suffice it\nto say that, without any analysis of whether the plaintiffs can\nbring private causes of action for equitable relief without\nexhausting administrative remedies under these state laws, the\nDistrict Court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the\nplaintiffs are likely to prevail on their state law claims.\n      We note, however, that nothing about the District\nCourt’s preliminary-injunction order relies specifically on a\nconclusion that the plaintiffs proved likely violations of\n\n\n\n\n                               42\n\fPennsylvania law. Thus, we need not vacate any part of it on\nthat ground. And even without proving likely violations of\nstate law, the plaintiffs’ successful showings under the EEOA\nmay support a preliminary injunction. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1712,\n1713 (contemplating equitable relief for EEOA violations).\nWe therefore proceed to the next element they must prove to\njustify one—irreparable harm.\n                               B\n       A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must prove\nirreparable harm is “likely” in the absence of relief. Winter v.\nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008); see\nFerring Pharm., 765 F.3d at 213–14, 217.\n        We agree with the District Court that without\npreliminary relief, irreparable harm was likely for these\nplaintiffs, who would have remained in Phoenix’s\naccelerated, non-sheltered program for at least the duration of\nthis litigation. The plaintiffs already demonstrated a\nreasonable probability that Phoenix’s programs are unsound\nfor them and fail to actually overcome their language barriers\nunder the EEOA. And these plaintiffs, all SLIFE, must\novercome uniquely difficult challenges to learning. Time is of\nthe essence: Their eligibility to attend public school in\nPennsylvania is dwindling. We recognize that a sound\neducational program has power to “change the trajectory of a\nchild’s life,” G.L. v. Ligonier Valley School District\nAuthority, 802 F.3d 601, 625 (3d Cir. 2015), while even a\n“few months” in an unsound program can make a “world of\ndifference in harm” to a child’s educational development,\nNieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 121–22 (1st\nCir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Plyler v.\nDoe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982) (noting the “lasting impact of\n[education’s] deprivation on the life of the child”). In\n\n\n\n                              43\n\faccordance with this injunction, moreover, four named\nplaintiffs now attend McCaskey, where they say they’re\n“flourishing.” Appellees’ Br. 45 n.11. Jockeying them back to\nPhoenix now would thus cause them greater harm, as the\nSchool District conceded during oral argument. Given these\nfactors, we are satisfied the plaintiffs showed a likelihood of\nirreparable harm absent this injunction.\n                                C\n        We must now balance the parties’ relative harms; that\nis, the potential injury to the plaintiffs without this injunction\nversus the potential injury to the defendant with it in place.\nNovartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-Merck\nConsumer Pharm. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 596 (3d Cir. 2002).\n        We already identified the irreparable harm the\nplaintiffs would likely suffer absent this injunction. And we\nagree with the District Court that the School District has “no\ninterest in continuing practices” that violate § 1703(f) of the\nEEOA. Issa, 2016 WL 4493202, at *8. The School District\nargues the plaintiffs fail on this element because the\ninjunction “permits usurpation” of its “decisionmaking\nauthority” to place “older, non-credited students where they\ncan best be educated,” which could lead to “future litigation”\nin other unspecified “areas of . . . discretion” and to the\n“erosion” of unspecified “authority and funds.” Appellant’s\nBr. 54. The record before us, however, belies the School\nDistrict’s contention that Phoenix is where the plaintiffs “can\nbest be educated.” Under the EEOA, we reject an educational\nagency’s call for unfettered decision-making authority when\nits programs fall short of § 1703(f)’s mandate. See Gomez,\n811 F.2d at 1041 (“[W]e cannot accord such sweeping\ndeference to state and local agencies that judicial review\nbecomes in practice judicial abdication.”). By the School\n\n\n\n                               44\n\fDistrict’s own representations, we know only eight students\ntransferred from Phoenix to McCaskey after the preliminary\ninjunction issued: four named plaintiffs and four similarly\nsituated students. The School District therefore retains\nsubstantial “decisionmaking authority” over the affairs of the\nvast majority of its students, this injunction notwithstanding.\nWe agree with the District Court that the balance of harms\nfavors the plaintiffs.\n                               D\n        Finally, we must weigh whether the public interest\nfavors this preliminary injunction. Doing so is “often fairly\nroutine.” Kos Pharm., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 730\n(3d Cir. 2004). If a plaintiff proves “both” a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits and irreparable injury, it “almost always\nwill be the case” that the public interest favors preliminary\nrelief. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Winback & Conserve Program,\nInc., 42 F.3d 1421, 1427 n.8 (3d Cir. 1994). The District\nCourt found that it’s “undeniably in the public interest for\nproviders of public education to comply with the\nrequirements” of the EEOA. Issa, 2016 WL 4493202, at *8\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We agree. Preliminary\nrelief is in the public interest here.\n                        *      *      *\n       Because the plaintiffs showed they’re likely to succeed\non the merits of their EEOA claims, they’re likely to suffer\nirreparable harm without relief, the balance of harms favors\nthem, and relief is in the public interest, we hold the District\n\n\n\n\n                              45\n\fCourt did not abuse its discretion in granting their\npreliminary-injunction motion.13\n                             IV\n       For the reasons explained above, we will affirm the\nDistrict Court’s preliminary-injunction order and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n         Though we will affirm this preliminary-injunction\norder, we recognize that significant administrative and\nbudgetary implications may arise when a federal court orders\nthe transfer of students across a school district. We note the\nSchool District wasn’t given the opportunity to propose its\nown remedy before the injunction issued. While the timing of\nthe injunction right before the start of the school year may\nhave made alternative relief impracticable at that time, the\nDistrict Court should allow the School District an opportunity\nto propose a legally compliant solution, among other\nalternatives considered by the Court, before the issuance of\nany permanent injunction, if the plaintiffs ultimately succeed\non the merits of their EEOA claims. See Horne, 557 U.S. at\n454 (stating that the EEOA, “while requiring a State to take\n‘appropriate action to overcome language barriers,’” leaves\nstate and local educational authorities a “‘substantial amount\nof latitude in choosing’ how this obligation is met” (quoting\nCastaneda, 648 F.2d at 1009)).\n\n\n\n                             46\n\f",

The District Court\ngranted that request, finding likely violations of Pennsylvania\nlaw and a provision of a federal statute we’ve never\naddressed—the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974\n(EEOA), 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f). The School District appeals,\nasking us to vacate that order. We will affirm based on the\nEEOA violations but not on the state law violations.\n                               I\n                              A\n       The named plaintiffs, now the appellees, are\nimmigrants, ages 18 to 21. They fled war, violence, and\npersecution in their native countries to come to the United\nStates, arriving here since 2014. International refugee\nagencies resettled them in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. None are\nnative English speakers. As students, all fall within a\nsubgroup of ELLs called SLIFE—students with limited or\ninterrupted formal education. SLIFE are English language\nlearners who are two or more years behind their appropriate\ngrade level, possess limited or no literacy in any language,\n\n\n\n                              4\n\fhave limited or interrupted formal educational backgrounds,\nand have endured stressful experiences causing acculturation\nchallenges. The named plaintiffs embody these traits.\n       Born in January 1998, Khadidja Issa, 19, fled Sudan\nwhen she was 5 to escape “insecurity” under President Omar\nal-Bashir. J.A. 568–69, 980. Until age 17, she lived in refugee\ncamps in Chad where she received her only prior schooling.\nHer native language is Fur. She also speaks Arabic. After\nimmigrating here in October 2015, she was resettled with her\nfamily in Lancaster. When she first arrived, she couldn’t\nspeak, read, write, or understand any English. She’s eligible\nto attend public school in Pennsylvania through 2019, the\nyear she turns 21.1\n       Qasin Hassan (or Q. M. H.), 18, was born in Somalia\nin September 1998. When he was 12, al-Shabaab militants\nkilled his father. He fled to Egypt. A native Somali speaker,\nhe took private lessons at home and learned “a little bit” of\nArabic, but he wasn’t accepted into Egyptian schools. J.A.\n575. He arrived in Lancaster with his family in September\n2015 speaking only “a few words” of English. Id. Like Issa,\nhe’s eligible to attend public school in Pennsylvania through\n2019, the year he turns 21.\n\n\n     1\n         Pennsylvania law provides that “[e]very child”\nbetween ages 6 and 21 “may attend the public schools in his\ndistrict” and that a child who reaches age 21 “during the\nschool term and who has not graduated from high school may\ncontinue to attend the public schools in his district free of\ncharge until the end of the school term.” 24 Pa. Stat. § 13-\n1301. “A child’s right to be admitted to school may not be\nconditioned on the child’s immigration status.” 22 Pa. Code §\n11.11(d).\n\n\n\n                              5\n\f        Sisters Sui Hnem Sung and Van Ni Iang (or V. N. I.),\nborn in October 1996 and October 1998, fled Burma when\ntheir father was forced into labor there. Sung, 20, and Iang,\n18, arrived with their family in Lancaster in November 2015.\nBy then, Sung had completed ninth grade and Iang eighth, but\nneither spoke or understood any English. Their native\nlanguage is Hakha Chin. Sung is eligible to attend public\nschool in Pennsylvania through 2017, the year she turns 21,\nand Iang is eligible through 2019, when she turns 21.\n       War forced brothers Alembe and Anyemu Dunia, ages\n21 and 19, to flee “very bad” circumstances in Tanzania to\nMozambique, where life in refugee camps remained “very\nbad” and “very difficult.” J.A. 615–16, 618. Native Swahili\nspeakers, they were taught in Portuguese until the eighth or\nninth grade when they could no longer afford schooling. With\n\n\n\n\n                             6\n\ftheir family, they arrived in Lancaster in November 2014\nspeaking “just basic” English, like “hello” and “hi.” J.A. 618.2\n         The International School and Phoenix Academy\n       The School District of Lancaster, the appellant in this\ncase, administers numerous schools. Two are relevant here:\nMcCaskey High School, which the School District operates\ndirectly, and Phoenix Academy, operated by Camelot Schools\n\n\n\n     2\n        After the preliminary injunction issued, Alembe and\nAnyemu Dunia decided they no longer wished to attend\nschool in the School District. Alembe is now 21 and Anyemu\nalready earned a high school diploma at Phoenix, so both\n“wish to further their education at community college.”\nAppellees’ Resp. to Stay Mot. 4 n.2. Though the complaint’s\nrequest for “supplemental educational services” as\ncompensatory relief for the School District’s alleged\nviolations (J.A. 97) might in other circumstances sustain a\nlive claim, here, the brothers have “chose[n] not to enroll”\nand disavowed any intention to “further their education”\nwithin the School District. Appellees’ Resp. to Stay Mot. 4\nn.2. Their claims for equitable relief are therefore moot. See\nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3170730\"><a href=\"/opinion/3170730/campbell-ewald-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On remand, the District Court should dismiss them\nas such. Nevertheless, because the brothers’ testimony and\nother evidence about their experiences with the School\nDistrict formed, in part, the basis for this preliminary\ninjunction, we consider it on appeal.\n\n\n\n                               7\n\fof Pennsylvania, LLC, a private, for-profit company under\ncontract with the School District.\n       McCaskey High School consists of two smaller\nschools. One is J.P. McCaskey, a traditional public high\nschool. The other is McCaskey East, known as the\nInternational School. The International School is a program\ndesigned primarily to teach language skills to students who\nspeak little, if any, English.3 Those students generally attend\nthe International School for one year, after which they join\nJ.P. McCaskey’s general population. During that year, they\nreceive “intensive ESL” (English as a second language)\nsupport through two 48-minute ESL courses per day. J.A.\n901, 1071. For “content” classes—science, math, social\nstudies, and other “enrichment subjects”—ELLs at the\nInternational School receive “content-based ESL” teaching\nthrough a method called “sheltered instruction.” J.A. 901.\nUnder that method, ELLs, including SLIFE, are grouped\ntogether in content courses with other ELLs at comparable\nEnglish-proficiency levels. ELLs are hence “sheltered” in\nthose classes from other ELLs at higher proficiency levels\nand from native English speakers. To foster English-language\nproficiency, the International School also introduces ELLs to\nnew American “cultural values and beliefs” while respecting\ntheir “cultural diversity” and embraces “close communication\n\n\n     3\n      Under 22 Pa. Code § 4.26, “[e]very school district shall\nprovide a program for each student whose dominant language\nis not English for the purpose of facilitating the student’s\nachievement of English proficiency and the academic\nstandards” of 22 Pa.

Sch. Dist. of Lancaster, No. 16-3881,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 26, 2016). It’s an\n“alternative education program” intended to serve “at-risk\nStudents” over-age for their grade, under-credited, and in\ndanger of not graduating high school before they age out of\npublic-school eligibility at 21. J.A. 904, 910. Phoenix’s\nprincipal missions are to ensure that students accumulate\nenough credits to graduate and to change students’ negative\nbehaviors—not to further their academic proficiencies. A\nsignificant portion of grading is therefore based on students’\nbehavior and attendance, known as “seat time.” J.A. 544, 639.\nIn step with its mission to change students’ “anti-social”\nbehaviors, J.A. 1039, Phoenix enforces stringent security\nmeasures not in effect at McCaskey, including daily pat-down\nsearches. Phoenix bars its students from bringing in or out\nany personal belongings, like backpacks, food, books, and\neven homework. And a strict dress code is in place. Based on\na hierarchical system, students are rewarded with different\ncolored shirts as they demonstrate improved behavior.\n       Teaching is also different at Phoenix. All Phoenix\nstudents, including ELLs, take an accelerated curriculum\nallowing them to earn a high school diploma in roughly half\n(but sometimes less than half) the time of a traditional four-\nyear high school, like McCaskey. Phoenix students take five\n80-minute classes per day, generally completing each class in\nhalf an academic year (90 days). McCaskey students, in\ncontrast, take seven 48-minute classes per day, generally\ncompleting each class in a full academic year (180 days).\nUnder these different schedules, McCaskey students receive\n\n\n\n\n                               9\n\fabout 1,440 more minutes, or twenty-four more hours, of\ninstruction per class than do students at Phoenix, the\nequivalent of about thirty more 48-minute class periods per\nclass. The upshot is, as one former Phoenix teacher put it, that\nPhoenix’s curriculum must be taught “double time.” J.A. 632.\n        Phoenix’s program for teaching English to ELLs also\ndiffers from the International School’s. Phoenix offers ELLs\nof all levels, with no special accommodations for SLIFE, one\n80-minute ESL course per day. Otherwise, ELLs, including\nSLIFE, take all their content courses—science, math, social\nstudies—with Phoenix’s general population under the\naccelerated model. In those content classes, ELLs aren’t\nsheltered from each other by their English proficiency or from\nnative English speakers like they are at the International\nSchool.\n       How does the School District empirically evaluate the\nefficacy of Phoenix’s ESL program? It doesn’t. The School\nDistrict does not assess in any measurable way whether\nPhoenix’s program helps ELLs overcome their language\nbarriers. It hasn’t attempted to weigh concretely the impact\nPhoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program has on ELLs,\nincluding SLIFE. Raw data about Phoenix’s ESL program\napparently exists. But the School District doesn’t\ndisaggregate it from data about the International School’s\nESL program. Because the two programs rely on different\nESL teaching methods, commingling the data means the\nSchool District cannot quantify whether Phoenix’s ESL\nprogram is successful.\n  The School District’s Enrollment Policies and Practices\n       Enrollment in Phoenix rather than McCaskey is\nusually a choice offered to students and their families. But\none group of prospective students isn’t offered that choice:\n\n\n\n                              10\n\fnew-to-the-District students over age 17 and under-credited.\nFor students in that category (which included the plaintiffs),\nthe choice is made for them: The School District unilaterally\nassigns them to Phoenix and doesn’t allow them to transfer to\nMcCaskey. This mandatory enrollment rule applies regardless\nof a student’s English proficiency or educational background\nand even if the student has several years of public school\neligibility left under Pennsylvania law. The School District\ndoes this, it says, because these students represent a higher\nrisk of dropping out or aging out at age 21 before earning a\nhigh school diploma, which is a prerequisite for future\nadvancement. But the School District’s funding and\nevaluations also turn, in part, on its graduation rates, which\ndecline when students drop out or age out at 21.\n       Actual enrollment at Phoenix hasn’t been a smooth\nprocess for these plaintiffs. While the School District\nunilaterally assigned them to Phoenix under the mandatory\nenrollment rule, their actual placement there proved far more\ndifficult. They experienced significant delays between when\nthey applied for enrollment and when they were either\nallowed to attend Phoenix or denied enrollment outright. The\nDistrict Court said it well: In “no case” did the School District\n“accomplish the enrollment of the plaintiffs within the five-\nday period mandated by state law.” Issa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat *2. Iang and Sung were not permitted to start at Phoenix\nuntil December 2015 and February 2016, though they\nenrolled in November 2015. Issa enrolled in November 2015\nbut wasn’t allowed to start at Phoenix until February 2016.\nHassan was initially denied enrollment outright. He was later\nenrolled when the School District learned he was 17, not 19, a\nfactor with “no legal significance” under Pennsylvania law.\nId. And by when the injunction issued in late-August 2016,\nthe School District had yet to enroll Alembe Dunia, despite\n\n\n\n                               11\n\fhis “repeated attempts to enroll dating back to at least January\n2015.” Id.\n       How Attending Phoenix Affected the Plaintiffs\n       For those plaintiffs ultimately admitted to Phoenix, a\n“common complaint” was that they didn’t understand the\n“vast majority” of content taught in their non-ESL classes.\nIssa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. The plaintiffs all testified—\nthrough interpreters—that Phoenix’s accelerated curriculum\nmoved too quickly for them to grasp. Apart from their\nPhoenix ESL courses, the plaintiffs explained, they couldn’t\nunderstand most of what their teachers and classmates were\nsaying. Despite these difficulties, they accrued credits and\nadvanced to higher grade levels.\n       Through her interpreter, Issa testified that Phoenix’s\nclasses went “very fast” and she didn’t “understand\nanything.” J.A. 572–73. She felt she wasn’t “benefiting” there\nand wanted to attend a school “slower in pace.” J.A. 573.\nWhen asked, she couldn’t explain what two of her classes\nwere about. In those classes, she said, her teachers and\nclassmates spoke and wrote only in English, which she\ncouldn’t understand. Nevertheless, she was promoted to the\nnext grade. Of eighty-four students in her class, she was\nranked first.\n       Hassan testified through his interpreter that learning at\nPhoenix was “impossible” and he only understood his ESL\nteacher. J.A. 580. He couldn’t understand his content-class\nteachers or classmates.\n       Through their interpreter, Iang and Sung explained\nthey too had great difficulty understanding their content\nclasses at Phoenix because they were all taught in English.\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fThey couldn’t understand their teachers or classmates, and\nthere were “never” interpreters there to help.

Despite his\n“readily apparent difficulties conversing in English” and his\ntestimony that Phoenix’s classes moved too “fast” for him, he\ngraduated sixth in his class of 107.

We start where we always do when\ninterpreting a statute: with its text. Passed in 1974 as a floor\namendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\nof 1965, the EEOA states in § 1703(f) that “[n]o State shall\ndeny equal educational opportunity to an individual on\naccount of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by\n. . . the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate\naction to overcome language barriers that impede equal\nparticipation by its students in its instructional programs.” 20\nU.S.C. § 1703(f). An “individual” denied an equal\neducational opportunity may bring a civil action in federal\ncourt “against such parties, and for such relief, as may be\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fappropriate.”5 Id. § 1706.

Because the EEOA itself doesn’t define\n“appropriate action,” we must look elsewhere for guidance.\n        We turn first to the Supreme Court’s decision in Lau v.\nNichols, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108910\"><a href=\"/opinion/108910/lau-v-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), issued just before Congress\npassed the EEOA. There, a school district failed to provide\nany English-language instruction to a significant number\n(about 60 percent) of its Chinese students. Id. at 564. Those\nstudents filed suit, alleging violations of Title VI, which\nrestricts federal funding for entities that discriminate based on\nrace, color, or national origin. Id. at 565. Finding adequate\nproof of a Title VI violation, the Court stressed the\nimportance of language instruction in American education.\n\n\n\n                               20\n\f       There is no equality of treatment merely by\n       providing students with the same facilities,\n       textbooks, teachers, and curriculum; for\n       students who do not understand English are\n       effectively foreclosed from any meaningful\n       education. Basic English skills are at the very\n       core of what . . . public schools teach.\n       Imposition of a requirement that, before a child\n       can effectively participate in the educational\n       program, he must already have acquired those\n       basic skills is to make a mockery of public\n       education. We know that those who do not\n       understand English are certain to find their\n       classroom          experiences           wholly\n       incomprehensible and in no way meaningful.\nId. at 566. Because no “specific remedy” was requested, the\nCourt left that question open, suggesting the school district\nhad latitude to decide how it would comply with Title VI:\n“Teaching English to the students of Chinese ancestry who do\nnot speak the language is one choice. Giving instructions to\nthis group in Chinese is another. There may be others.” Id. at\n564–65.\n        Lau’s pronouncements about Title VI were later called\ninto question, and the Supreme Court ultimately recognized\nits abrogation on that ground. See Alexander v. Sandoval, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620697\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620697/alexander-v-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (2001) (“[W]e have since rejected Lau’s\ninterpretation of [Title VI.]”). In enacting § 1703(f), however,\nCongress embraced Lau’s “essential holding” that “schools\nare not free to ignore the need of limited English speaking\nchildren for language assistance.” Castaneda, 648 F.2d at\n1008.\n\n\n\n\n                              21\n\f       Following Lau and § 1703(f)’s enactment, the Fifth\nCircuit handed down Castaneda v. Pickard in 1981. Claiming\nviolations of § 1703(f), Mexican-American students sued\ntheir school district, alleging its failure to implement a\nbilingual-education program impeded their ability to\novercome language barriers. Id. at 992. Measuring § 1703(f)’s\nreach, the Fifth Circuit found that by using the “less specific\nterm, ‘appropriate action,’” Congress left state and local\nauthorities a “substantial amount of latitude” to choose the\n“programs and techniques they would use” to satisfy §\n1703(f)’s mandate. Id. at 1008. But too much latitude, the\ncourt cautioned, would render § 1703(f) a nullity.\nAccordingly, the Fifth Circuit held that state educational\nagencies must make a “genuine and good faith effort,\nconsistent with local circumstances and resources, to remedy\nthe language deficiencies of their students” under § 1703(f),\nand noted that Congress “deliberately placed on federal courts\nthe difficult responsibility of determining whether that\nobligation [is] met.” Id. at 1009. Without guidance from\nCongress on what “appropriate action” looks like, however,\nthe Fifth Circuit found itself, like we are now,\n      confronted with a type of task which federal\n      courts are ill-equipped to perform and which we\n      are often criticized for undertaking—\n      prescribing substantive standards and policies\n      for institutions whose governance is properly\n      reserved to other levels and branches of our\n      government (i.e., state and local educational\n      agencies) which are better able to assimilate and\n      assess the knowledge of professionals in the\n      field.\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\fId. Nevertheless, the court charted a path forward, fashioning\na “mode of analysis” to fulfill the responsibility Congress\nreposed in the federal courts under § 1703(f) without “unduly\nsubstituting” its “educational values and theories” for the\n“educational and political decisions” reserved to state and\nlocal school authorities and the “expert knowledge of\neducators.” Id. That “mode of analysis,” it said, is threefold.\nFirst, courts\n       examine carefully the evidence the record\n       contains concerning the soundness of the\n       educational theory or principles upon which the\n       challenged program is based. This, of course, is\n       not to be done with any eye toward discerning\n       the relative merits of sound but competing\n       bodies of expert educational opinion . . . . The\n       court’s responsibility . . . is only to ascertain\n       that a school system is [pursuing] a program\n       informed by an educational theory recognized\n       as sound by some experts in the field or, at\n       least, deemed a legitimate experimental\n       strategy.\nId. Second, courts determine whether the programs and\npractices “actually used” by the school system are\n“reasonably calculated to implement effectively the\neducational theory adopted by the school.” Id. at 1010. And\nthird, if an otherwise-sound and effectively-implemented\nprogram fails to “produce results” indicating that language\nbarriers are “actually being overcome,” it may “no longer\nconstitute appropriate action.” Id. Applying this test, the Fifth\nCircuit found “serious doubts” under prong two about the\nlanguage competency of teachers employed in the school\n\n\n\n\n                               23\n\fdistrict’s bilingual classrooms and remanded for an\nevidentiary hearing. Id. at 1012–13, 1015.\n       Courts have consistently followed Castaneda’s\napproach to apply § 1703(f)’s third element, requiring\n“appropriate action.” See, e.g., United States v.

And in Horne v. Flores, the Supreme Court relied on\nCastaneda to apply § 1703(f), 557 U.S. at 440–41, 454–55,\nthough it did not adopt the Fifth Circuit’s test explicitly, id. at\n458 n.8 (expressing no view on “whether or not this test\nprovides much concrete guidance regarding the meaning of\n‘appropriate action’”). Given these decisions and the parties’\nagreement that Castaneda should here guide our analysis, we\nwill apply the Fifth Circuit’s three-part test. Though we\ndecline to adopt “without qualification” Castaneda’s\nframework and think “fine tuning must await future cases,”\nwe believe this test, as a general matter, properly balances §\n1703(f)’s “allocation of responsibilities between the courts\nand the schools” and hence provides a “fruitful starting point”\nfor our analysis under § 1703(f)’s third element. Gomez, 811\nF.2d at 1041.\n        Applying Castaneda here to resolve whether the\nSchool District took “appropriate action” to overcome the\nplaintiffs’ language barriers under § 1703(f), we agree with\n\n\n\n\n                                24\n\fthe District Court: The School District foundered on\nCastaneda’s first and third prongs. We explain why below.7\n                    Castaneda Prong One\n       On Castaneda’s first prong—satisfied where an\neducational agency fails to pursue a program informed by an\neducational theory recognized as sound by some experts in\nthe field—the plaintiffs showed a reasonable probability of\nsuccess. Their expert, Dr. Marshall, testified consistently and\nat length that Phoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program\nfor ELLs is unsound for SLIFE (again, students with limited\nor interrupted formal education). The plaintiffs and two\nformer Phoenix teachers corroborated her testimony. The\nSchool District did not rebut it with another expert or through\ncontrary research. We see no clear error here.\n      SLIFE, Dr. Marshall emphasized, generally struggle or\nhave yet to learn to read or write in any language, including\n\n     7\n        Because the District Court concluded Phoenix’s\naccelerated, non-sheltered program doesn’t satisfy\nCastaneda’s first and third prongs, it didn’t address\nCastaneda’s second prong—whether the programs and\npractices actually used by the School District are reasonably\ncalculated to implement effectively the educational theory\nadopted. This wasn’t error. The District Court was right that\nCastaneda’s test is “conjunctive.” Issa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*6. All three prongs must be met for an educational agency’s\nprogram to satisfy § 1703(f)’s “appropriate action” element.\nSee Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1009–10. While we thank the\nUnited States as amicus curiae for its thoughtful analysis of\nCastaneda’s second prong, given the plaintiffs’ successful\nshowings under prongs one and three, we need not and do not\nreach Castaneda’s second prong here.\n\n\n\n                              25\n\ftheir native languages. Not only must they learn English in\nAmerican schools, she explained, they must learn how to\nlearn there. See J.A. 651 (“[W]e have to teach [SLIFE] for\nthe first time how to read in a language that isn’t even a\nlanguage they speak yet.”); J.A. 652 (describing how teaching\nin the United States relies on “decontextualized tasks”—\nmultiple choice, matching, and true-false questions—that\nforeign students are “completely unaware of”). Dr. Marshall\nsaid that for SLIFE to succeed, teaching must “go more\nslowly and build, build the language, build the literacy,” and\n“fill in the gaps.” J.A. 656. This testimony went\nunchallenged.\n        Given SLIFE’s need for unhurried and deliberate\nliteracy and language development, Dr. Marshall opined that\nPhoenix’s accelerated curriculum is “totally inappropriate”\nfor them. Id.; see J.A. 671 (“For SLIFE . . . it is\ncontraindicated. It is the opposite of what they need.”).\nStudents like the plaintiffs who are “behind academically”\nand “don’t understand English,” she explained, “cannot be\nexpected to go faster through content when they haven’t\nreached a threshold of English.” J.A. 656. Her view, she\nattested, accords with those of other experts in the field. She\nwas unaware of any contrary research, and the School District\ndidn’t point to any. “Uniformly,” she said, “the field in\ntalking about [SLIFE] talks about going more slowly,\nbuilding in redundancy, building in repetition, and having\nthem become familiar with material in many different ways in\norder for them to learn it, and not to go at double time.” Id.\n(emphasis added); see J.A. 658 (“Again and again they say\nthe key is to take your time, present [the material] in a variety\nof ways, make sure they get it . . . and nobody is talking about\naccelerating.”). No evidence was presented that an\n\n\n\n\n                               26\n\faccelerated curriculum, on its own, is accepted as sound\neducational theory for SLIFE.\n       Dr. Marshall also opined consistently that “sheltered\ninstruction” content classes, like those offered at the\nInternational School, are “needed” for SLIFE, J.A. 661–63,\n667, and that Phoenix’s commingling of SLIFE with higher-\nlevel ELLs and native English speakers, when combined with\naccelerated content courses, is not accepted as sound\neducational theory, J.A. 666 (“[I]f you’re going to try and\nhave newcomers with very little English . . . mixed in with\nfluid English speakers . . . what happens is that it becomes\noverwhelming for the lower level ELLs.”); see J.A. 667\n(“SLIFE need an entire day of instruction that’s tailored to\nthem.”); J.A. 669 (“[W]hen [SLIFE are] in their content\nclasses with native speakers . . . they’re not understanding\nwhat’s happening, they’re really not progressing, they’re not\nmoving forward . . . [b]ecause they’re not actually learning\nthe material.”). Here too, no evidence was adduced that\naccelerated, unsheltered instruction is accepted as sound\neducational theory for SLIFE. The plaintiffs’ own testimony,\ncited extensively above, confirmed their great difficulty in\nunderstanding their accelerated, non-sheltered content classes\nat Phoenix.\n       Former Phoenix teacher Jandy Rivera reinforced Dr.\nMarshall’s and the plaintiffs’ testimony, explaining that her\n“refugee students” were “not able to master the material” in\nPhoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program. J.A. 633. She\nstated that “[a]t the fast pace and atmosphere at Phoenix,”\nrefugee students were “not able to learn”; that these students\n“needed a regularly paced atmosphere, or perhaps even an\nextended learning atmosphere in order to master the\nmaterial”; and that in her experience, Phoenix’s program\n\n\n\n\n                             27\n\f“didn’t work” for newly arrived ELLs. Id. Phoenix’s lead-\nESL teacher, Marianne Ortiz, similarly corroborated Dr.\nMarshall’s testimony, stating that the International School is a\n“better placement for entering students” because it’s not\n“accelerated” and gives ELLs “sheltered [instruction] content\nclasses.” J.A. 837. Given this evidence, we see no clear error\nin the District Court’s findings that\n       [w]hen a student with no ability to speak or\n       understand English, such as the plaintiffs, is\n       placed in accelerated classes, the student will\n       cover material twice as fast as a normal school,\n       but that material is also taught in a language\n       that student does not understand. On its face,\n       this practice appears to be counterintuitive;\n       expert testimony confirmed that the practice\n       was unsound . . . . The District did not offer any\n       expert to the contrary. Instead, the District\n       offered its ESL Coordinator [Amber Hilt], who\n       testified that the “structured immersion”\n       technique is a sound theory generally for\n       overcoming language barriers, but nothing\n       persuasive to the court to contradict Dr.\n       Marshall’s testimony that this technique was\n       not recognized as sound for an accelerated,\n       credit-recovery program. The Phoenix model of\n       accelerated    learning     presents      different\n       language barriers than a traditional education\n       program, and is particularly imposing for\n       students who cannot yet understand the\n       language in which the courses are taught.\nIssa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3, *6 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f       On appeal, the School District attempts merely to\nimpeach the credibility of Dr. Marshall’s testimony. It points\nout, for example, that Dr. Marshall “neglected” to “personally\nobserve” Phoenix’s “classrooms/environments,” although\nRivera and Ortiz and all six named plaintiffs reinforced her\ntestimony. Appellant’s Br. 43. It says Dr. Marshall was a\nmere “teacher of teachers,” not an ESL instructor, without\nexplaining why that might render the District Court’s reliance\non her testimony clearly erroneous. Id. And it says Dr.\nMarshall contradicted herself when she testified that\n“immersion” of ELLs in content classes with native speakers\nimpeded their progress, not necessarily acceleration. Id. at 44.\nBut when we consider the record en bloc, these alleged\nblemishes in Dr. Marshall’s testimony fail to persuade us that\nthe District Court’s findings are “completely devoid of\nminimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of\ncredibility” or bear “no rational relationship to the supportive\nevidentiary data,” as required to show clear error. Havens,\n820 F.3d at 92 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n       For these reasons, the District Court did not err in\nconcluding that the plaintiffs showed a reasonable probability\nthat Phoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered program isn’t\ninformed by an educational theory recognized as sound by\nsome experts in the field, as required under Castaneda’s first\nprong.\n                   Castaneda Prong Three\n       On Castaneda’s third prong—satisfied where an\neducational agency’s programs fail to produce results\nindicating that language barriers are actually being\novercome—we agree with the District Court that the plaintiffs\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success. The evidence shows\nthat the School District doesn’t keep separate data on the\n\n\n\n                              29\n\fefficacy of Phoenix’s ESL program. This rendered it difficult,\nif not impossible, for the District Court to ascertain whether\nthe plaintiffs’ language barriers were actually being overcome\nat Phoenix. Given this evidence, we see no clear error in the\nDistrict Court’s findings, unchallenged on appeal, that\n       [u]ndisputed testimony offered in court shows\n       that the District does not evaluate whether the\n       “language barriers confronting students are\n       actually being overcome” at Phoenix [as\n       required by Castaneda]. The ESL Coordinator\n       [Hilt] acknowledged that “there is no data . . .\n       that would allow us to determine whether . . .\n       the ESL delivered to these students in . . .\n       Phoenix[’s] accelerated model is working or\n       not.” [J.A. 734.] Because the District did not\n       disaggregate the Phoenix data to make this\n       assessment, it could not demonstrate the\n       effectiveness of the program to the court.\n       Through her own efforts, Dr. Marshall was able\n       to discern from limited data provided by the\n       District that Phoenix’s performance on literacy\n       measures—the core measure of “overcoming\n       language barriers”—was far worse than\n       McCaskey’s.\nIssa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. The School District’s\nSuperintendent, Dr. Damaris Rau, confirmed that the\neffectiveness of Phoenix’s ESL program had yet to be\nevaluated. J.A. 746–47. This further supports the District\nCourt’s findings.\n       On appeal, the School District argues Phoenix’s ESL\ninstruction “is and continues to be successful.” Appellant’s\nBr. 44. To bolster that point, it notes that one named plaintiff,\n\n\n\n                               30\n\fAnyemu Dunia, graduated from Phoenix and read an essay\naloud in court, while “many” other unspecified ELLs have\ngone on to college after graduating Phoenix. Id. (citing J.A.\n627). Though he could read an essay aloud in court, the\nDistrict Court found that Anyemu had “readily apparent\ndifficulties conversing in English,” Issa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat *3 n.2, and Anyemu himself testified that he could only\n“catch . . . some word[s]” when his English-speaking teachers\ntalked to him in class, J.A. 620. Even if we were to accept this\nas sufficient indicia of Anyemu’s progress, his ability to read\na portion of an essay in court says nothing about whether the\nother four named plaintiffs were overcoming their own\nlanguage barriers at Phoenix. The record here amply supports\nthe District Court’s conclusion that they were not. As\nexplained before, all testified they couldn’t understand what\ntheir teachers and classmates were saying in their content\nclasses at Phoenix. This argument therefore fails to show\nclear error.\n        We also find unavailing the School District’s\ncontention, in its papers and at oral argument, that an ELL’s\nability to graduate Phoenix, on its own, weighs in the School\nDistrict’s favor under § 1703(f). On this record, we see little\nevidence of a meaningful connection between ELLs\ngraduating from Phoenix’s accelerated, non-sheltered\nprogram and ELLs actually overcoming their language\nbarriers there. On the contrary, there is ample evidence\nsupporting the District Court’s finding that “[a]lthough the\nstudent earns (or at least is issued) a diploma and all of the\nattendant benefits, the student will likely graduate [Phoenix]\nwith limited ability, if any, to converse in English—also often\na prerequisite to future advancement—and limited\nunderstanding of the content of the courses he actually took.”\nIssa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4493202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. We therefore conclude that\n\n\n\n                              31\n\fthe plaintiffs showed a likelihood that Phoenix’s program\nfails to produce results indicating that their language barriers\nare actually being overcome, as required under Castaneda’s\nthird prong.\n      Because the plaintiffs showed a likelihood of success\nunder Castaneda’s three-part test, they met § 1703(f)’s third\nelement, requiring proof that the School District failed to take\n“appropriate action” to “overcome” their language barriers.\n   Section 1703(f)’s Fourth Element: “On Account of” a\n                  Protected Characteristic\n        We now address § 1703(f)’s fourth and final element,\nwhich requires proof the plaintiffs were denied equal\neducational opportunity on account of their race, color, sex,\nor national origin. See 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f). We hold they met\nthis element.\n      The Supreme Court has yet to address how the\npreamble to § 1703, which includes the “on account of”\nlanguage here in issue, interacts with the rest of § 1703 and\nsubsection (f) in particular. The Court did not discuss the\nmatter in Horne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145850\"><a href=\"/opinion/145850/horne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, so we look\nelsewhere. In its entirety, § 1703 provides that\n       [n]o State shall deny equal educational\n       opportunity to an individual on account of his\n       or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by—\n        (a) the deliberate segregation by an\n        educational agency of students on the basis of\n        race, color, or national origin among or within\n        schools;\n\n\n\n\n                              32\n\f(b) the failure of an educational agency which\nhas formerly practiced such deliberate\nsegregation to take affirmative steps,\nconsistent with part 4 of this subchapter, to\nremove the vestiges of a dual school system;\n(c) the assignment by an educational agency of\na student to a school, other than the one closest\nto his or her place of residence within the\nschool district in which he or she resides, if the\nassignment results in a greater degree of\nsegregation of students on the basis of race,\ncolor, sex, or national origin among the\nschools of such agency than would result if\nsuch student were assigned to the school\nclosest to his or her place of residence within\nthe school district of such agency providing\nthe appropriate grade level and type of\neducation for such student;\n(d) discrimination by an educational agency\non the basis of race, color, or national origin in\nthe employment, employment conditions, or\nassignment to schools of its faculty or staff,\nexcept to fulfill the purposes of subsection (f)\nbelow;\n(e) the transfer by an educational agency,\nwhether voluntary or otherwise, of a student\nfrom one school to another if the purpose and\neffect of such transfer is to increase\nsegregation of students on the basis of race,\ncolor, or national origin among the schools of\nsuch agency; or\n\n\n\n\n                      33\n\f         (f) the failure by an educational agency to take\n         appropriate action to overcome language\n         barriers that impede equal participation by its\n         students in its instructional programs.\n        The School District suggests § 1703’s preamble\nrequires the plaintiffs to prove it failed to take appropriate\naction to overcome their language barriers on account of their\nnational origins under § 1703(f). The School District\ninterprets “on account of” to require a showing of intentional\ndiscrimination, contending there’s insufficient evidence the\nplaintiffs’ national origins “motivated their placement at\nPhoenix.” Reply Br. 3–4.8 We reject this reading of § 1703.\n       We start with what § 1703(f) doesn’t require when\nread together with § 1703’s “on account of” language: a\nshowing of discrimination of any kind, intentional or\notherwise, on account of an EEOA-protected characteristic.\nCongress expressly included the word “discrimination” in §\n\n\n     8\n        The School District raised this argument only in\npassing in the District Court and for the first time on appeal in\nits reply brief. We could therefore consider it waived. See\nPrometheus Radio Project v.

We therefore join the Fifth Circuit in holding\nthat § 1703(f) prohibits the mere failure by an educational\nagency to take appropriate action to overcome students’\nlanguage barriers, “regardless of whether such a failure is\nmotivated by an intent to discriminate against those students.”\nCastaneda, 648 F.2d at 1008. And we add that, because §\n1703(f) doesn’t say “discrimination,” there’s no requirement\nunder it to prove discrimination of any kind, including, for\nexample, disparate impact discrimination.9 This reading\n\n     9\n       The School District’s argument is premised on the\nnotion that “on account of” in § 1703’s preamble not only\nmodifies the denial of “equal educational opportunity” but\nalso the particular state action or inaction proscribed in each\nof § 1703’s subsections. The statute’s language, however,\ndoesn’t support that reading. The preamble merely states a\ngeneral prohibition on the denial of equal educational\nopportunity “on account of” a protected characteristic\nviolated per se “by” the state acting or failing to act in\naccordance with subsections (a) through (f). Each subsection\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fthus creates a separate cause of action for the denial of equal\neducational opportunity on account of an EEOA-protected\ncharacteristic, and none requires proof that the state’s action\nor inaction was itself “on account of” such a characteristic.\n      The School District’s reading also fails to distinguish\nbetween the phrase “on the basis of” a protected\ncharacteristic—which Congress has used traditionally and in\nthis very statute to designate discriminatory intent, see §§\n1702(a)(1), 1703(a), (e)—and the phrase “on account of” a\nprotected characteristic, which we presume, consistent with\nbasic canons of statutory construction, Congress used\nintentionally in § 1703’s preamble to convey a different\nmeaning.

Stated differently, we hold\nthat the denial of the equal educational opportunity—in §\n1703(f)’s case, the language barrier that is not being\novercome—must stem from race, color, sex, or national\norigin, rather than from, for example, a cognitive disability\ncovered by a different remedial scheme, like the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.\nApplying this reading here, we conclude the record fully\nsupports that the plaintiffs’ language barriers, and hence their\n\n     10\n          The School District says the Eighth Circuit’s 2010\ndecision in Mumid v.

It doesn’t. Specifically, the\nSchool District points to Mumid’s statement that a “policy\nthat treats students with limited English proficiency\ndifferently than other students . . . does not facially\ndiscriminate based on national origin.” Id. at 795. The School\nDistrict omits, however, that the Eighth Circuit said that in\naddressing Title VI claims, not EEOA claims. See id. at 793–\n95. When the Court of Appeals dealt with the students’\nEEOA claims in Mumid, it did so on standing grounds, noting\nexpressly that it would “assume” without deciding that\nevidence of the school’s failure to take appropriate action to\novercome language barriers “could support a finding that the\nDistrict denied equal educational opportunity ‘on account of\n. . . national origin.’” Id. at 795–96 (emphasis added). Mumid\ntherefore doesn’t support—and actually hurts—the School\nDistrict’s position.\n\n\n\n                              38\n\flost educational opportunities, stem from their national\norigins.\n       Thus, the plaintiffs satisfied § 1703(f)’s fourth\nelement, as they were denied equal educational opportunity\n“on account of” an EEOA-protected characteristic: their\nnational origins. Given the plaintiffs’ successful showings\nunder all four of § 1703(f)’s elements, we agree with the\nDistrict Court that they demonstrated a likelihood of success\non their EEOA claims.\n                               2\n        We turn now to whether the plaintiffs demonstrated a\nreasonable probability of success on the merits of their state\nlaw claims. Because neither the plaintiffs nor the District\nCourt addressed the threshold question whether the plaintiffs’\nstate law claims are cognizable, we’ll remand for the District\nCourt to consider that question in the first instance.\n        In Pennsylvania, every child who hasn’t graduated\nfrom high school “may attend” the public schools in her\ndistrict until the end of the school year in which she turns 21.\n24 Pa.

A\nschool district “shall normally enroll a child the next business\nday, but no later than [within] 5 business days of application.”\nId. § 11.11(b).

Unlike the\nEEOA, which explicitly grants “individual[s]” the right to\n“institute a civil action” in court for equitable relief, 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1706, 1713, our de novo review reveals nothing in\n24 Pa.

The District Court thus implicitly\nassumed such a private cause of action and remedy may be so\ninferred without exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n        Without any briefing on these issues—which appear to\nbe matters of first impression under Pennsylvania law—we\ndecline to resolve them.

Suffice it\nto say that, without any analysis of whether the plaintiffs can\nbring private causes of action for equitable relief without\nexhausting administrative remedies under these state laws, the\nDistrict Court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the\nplaintiffs are likely to prevail on their state law claims.\n      We note, however, that nothing about the District\nCourt’s preliminary-injunction order relies specifically on a\nconclusion that the plaintiffs proved likely violations of\n\n\n\n\n                               42\n\fPennsylvania law. Thus, we need not vacate any part of it on\nthat ground. And even without proving likely violations of\nstate law, the plaintiffs’ successful showings under the EEOA\nmay support a preliminary injunction. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1712,\n1713 (contemplating equitable relief for EEOA violations).\nWe therefore proceed to the next element they must prove to\njustify one—irreparable harm.\n                               B\n       A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must prove\nirreparable harm is “likely” in the absence of relief.

The School District\nargues the plaintiffs fail on this element because the\ninjunction “permits usurpation” of its “decisionmaking\nauthority” to place “older, non-credited students where they\ncan best be educated,” which could lead to “future litigation”\nin other unspecified “areas of . . . discretion” and to the\n“erosion” of unspecified “authority and funds.” Appellant’s\nBr. 54. The record before us, however, belies the School\nDistrict’s contention that Phoenix is where the plaintiffs “can\nbest be educated.” Under the EEOA, we reject an educational\nagency’s call for unfettered decision-making authority when\nits programs fall short of § 1703(f)’s mandate. See Gomez,\n811 F.2d at 1041 (“[W]e cannot accord such sweeping\ndeference to state and local agencies that judicial review\nbecomes in practice judicial abdication.”). By the School\n\n\n\n                               44\n\fDistrict’s own representations, we know only eight students\ntransferred from Phoenix to McCaskey after the preliminary\ninjunction issued: four named plaintiffs and four similarly\nsituated students. The School District therefore retains\nsubstantial “decisionmaking authority” over the affairs of the\nvast majority of its students, this injunction notwithstanding.\nWe agree with the District Court that the balance of harms\nfavors the plaintiffs.\n                               D\n        Finally, we must weigh whether the public interest\nfavors this preliminary injunction.

We note the\nSchool District wasn’t given the opportunity to propose its\nown remedy before the injunction issued. While the timing of\nthe injunction right before the start of the school year may\nhave made alternative relief impracticable at that time, the\nDistrict Court should allow the School District an opportunity\nto propose a legally compliant solution, among other\nalternatives considered by the Court, before the issuance of\nany permanent injunction, if the plaintiffs ultimately succeed\non the merits of their EEOA claims.
