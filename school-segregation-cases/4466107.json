McNutt\n\nmade a gift of the north 2000 acres of his ranch to his daughter, Sherry McNutt,\n\nAppellee, in 1983.     The trial court found that William H. McNutt gifted the\n\n“foreman’s house” and five acres of land that was located on the north 2000 acres\n\nof his ranch, but also found that he did not gift the entire north side of the ranch to\n\n\n                                           1\n\fher. The case was appealed to this court which upheld the decision that there was\n\nnot a gift of the entire north side of the ranch, but remanded the case for a new trial\n\non the issues of whether there was a gift of the foreman’s house and an appropriate\n\namount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n      After the second trial, the jury once again found that William H. McNutt\n\ngifted the foreman’s house to Appellee and that “1/2 of the North Side” was the\n\nnecessary amount of land to allow Appellee an appropriate amount of acreage for\n\nthe full use and enjoyment of the house. Appellants have appealed the judgment of\n\nthe trial court awarding Appellee the foreman’s house and ½ of the North Side of\n\nthe ranch.\n\n              STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellee does not believe that oral argument will aid this Court in\n\ndetermining the issues presented by this appeal. The facts in this case are straight-\n\nforward and the issues in this case have previously been addressed by this Court.\n\n\n                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      In 1983, William H. McNutt called his daughter, Appellee, Sherry McNutt,\n\nand asked her to return to the ranch and run it for him. William H. McNutt told\n\nSherry McNutt that if she agreed to return half the ranch was hers. Sherry McNutt\n\nreturned to the ranch, made substantial improvements to the foreman’s house and\n\nto the surrounding area, garden, and barns. She ran two operations, livestock and\n\n                                          2\n\fgoats and sheep, until the family and herself ventured into exotics. Sherry McNutt\n\nmanaged the South side exotic operation for her dad, William H. McNutt until\n\n2001 when William H. McNutt gave the all the wildlife to Mrs. McNutt and to\n\nSherry McNutt including the income thereof.\n\n      At no time prior to his death did William H. McNutt ever try to dispossess\n\nSherry McNutt of the foreman’s house. William never sought to undo the finality\n\nof the 1983 gift of the foreman’s house and the appropriate amount of acreage for\n\nthe full use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n      After a bench trial in 2011, Judge Loving found that William H. McNutt\n\ngave the foreman’s house to Sherry McNutt. On appeal, this Court found that\n\nthere was sufficient evidence of a gift of the foreman’s house and remanded the\n\ncase to determine the appropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment\n\nof the house. After a second trial, the jury again found that William H. McNutt\n\ngave the foreman’s house to Sherry McNutt, and after hearing the testimony the\n\njury found that ½ of the North Side was the appropriate amount of acreage for the\n\nfull use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The gift of the foreman’s house legally meets the requirements of an oral gift\n\nof real property. The evidence at trial establishes that William H. McNutt gave the\n\nforeman’s house to Sherry McNutt in 1983. Since the evidence at trial was legally\n\n\n                                           3\n\fand factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding of a gift to Sherry McNutt, the\n\nCourt did not err in refusing to grant the Appellant’s Motion for Directed Verdict\n\nand Motion for Judgment N.O.V.\n\n       This case was remanded for the determination of two issues: (1) was there an\n\noral gift of the foreman’s house to Appellee, and; (2) what amount of land an\n\nappropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house. These\n\nissues were correctly submitted to the jury in the form of the jury charge given by\n\nthe trial court.\n\n       Although Appellants argue that misconduct occurred during the jury\n\ndeliberations, they have failed to present any admissible evidence of the alleged\n\nmisconduct.\n\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\n   I. Oral Gifts of Real Property.\n\n       There are three elements required to establish an oral gift of real property:\n\n(1) a gift in praesenti, (2) possession under the gift by the donee with the donor's\n\nconsent, and (3) permanent and valuable improvements made on the property by\n\nthe donee with the donor's knowledge or consent or, without improvements, the\n\nexistence of such facts as would make it a fraud upon the donee not to enforce the\n\ngift. Thompson v. Dart, 746 S.W.2d 821, 825 (Tex.App. —San Antonio 1988, no\n\nwrit); see also Hooks v. Bridgewater, 111 Tex. 122, 229 S.W. 1114, 1116 (1921).\n\n                                          4\n\f“In praesenti” means at the present time; thus, to be a gift in praesenti, the donor\n\nmust, at the time he makes it, intend an immediate divestiture of the rights of\n\nownership out of himself and a consequent immediate vesting of such rights in the\n\ndonee. Id.\n\n      However, a presumption of gift arises if a parent delivers possession,\n\nconveys title, or purchases property in the name of a child. Oadra v. Stegall, 871\n\nS.W.2d 882, 891 (Tex.App. —Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no pet.); Richardson v.\n\nLaney, 911 S.W.2d 489, 492 (Tex.App. —Texarkana 1995, no writ); Woodworth v.\n\nCortez, 660 S.W.2d 561, 564 (Tex.App. —San Antonio 1983, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\nThis is a rebuttable presumption that the opponent must show by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence at trial. Richardson, 911 S.W.2d at 492.\n\nII.   The evidence introduced at trial was legally and factually sufficient to\n      support the jury’s finding that William H. McNutt gave Appellee the\n      foreman’s house and ½ of the North Side in 1983.\n\n      Appellants’ fourth issue challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that William H. McNutt gave the foreman’s\n\nhouse and ½ of the North Side of the ranch in 1983. A review of the testimony at\n\ntrial shows that the overwhelming weight of the evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfindings.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      a.     Appellate Review of Clear and Convincing Evidence.\n\n\n      When the burden of proof at trial requires clear and convincing evidence, the\n\nCourt of Appeals must review the sufficiency of the evidence by giving “due\n\nconsideration to evidence that the fact finder could reasonably have found to be\n\nclear and convincing.” In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256, 266 (Tex. 2002); (relying on In\n\nre C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 25 (Tex.2002)); In re C.E., 100 S.W.3d 368, 370\n\n(Tex.App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.). In a legal sufficiency review, we look at\n\nall the evidence in the light most favorable to the fact finding to determine whether\n\na reasonable trier of fact could have formed a firm belief or conviction that the\n\nfinding was true. In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d at 266. Unless the Court determines that\n\nno reasonable fact finder could form a firm belief or conviction that the fact is true,\n\nthe Court must conclude that the evidence is legally sufficient. Id.\n\n      In a factual sufficiency review, the Court must give due consideration to\n\nevidence that the fact finder could reasonably have found to be clear and\n\nconvincing. Id., citing In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d at 25. The Court should consider\n\nwhether disputed evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could not have\n\nresolved the dispute in favor of its finding. Id. On Appeal, the Court may not\n\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder because the fact-finder “[is] the\n\nsole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their\n\ntestimony.” City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 819 (Tex. 2005); see also\n                                           6\n\fMarin Real Estate Partners, L.P. v. Vogt, 373 S.W.3d 57, 83 (Tex.App.—San\n\nAntonio 2011, no pet.). The evidence is factually sufficient if a factfinder could\n\nreasonably form a firm belief or conviction about the truth of the matter to be\n\nproven. In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d at 266; see also In re M.M., 184 S.W.3d 416, 418\n\n(Tex.App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.).\n\n      b.     Testimony of Witnesses at Trial.\n\n      The following testimony supports the jury’s verdict that William H. McNutt\n\ngave his daughter the foreman’s hours in 1983:\n\nTestimony of David Ross\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) Now, Mr. Ross, regarding the house that's on the\n      north side of I-10 on the McNutt Ranch --\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. -- did you ever have any conversations with Bill McNutt regarding\n      that house?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. What did he tell you?\n\n      A. Well, that it was the previous ranch foreman's house and that it was\n      given to Sherry. In fact, I helped Sherry remodel that house, helped\n      her furnish it, spent time there as a guest with other projects that she\n      worked on around there, building barns, building her gardens,\n      landscaping, et cetera.\n\n      Q. All right. My question to you, sir, was Bill McNutt clear or unclear\n      about that statement that you just made?\n\n      A. I felt it was clear.\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f      Q. All right, and my second part of my question was, was his\n      statement to you convincing or unconvincing?\n\n      A. It would be convincing.\n\n      Q. All right, and through the years that you went out to the McNutt\n      Ranch, did you ever hear Bill McNutt make any statements in\n      contravention of what you just testified to?\n\n      A. No. I did not.\n\n      Q. All right. So the home that's on the north side, to paraphrase your\n      testimony, he said that's Sherry's home.\n\n      A. Correct.\n\nRR 1; p. 153, l. 15 – p. 154, l. 20.\n\n      Q. All right. Now -- so from the time that you met him, your\n      testimony is never at any time did he ever modify, retract, or make\n      any statements regarding Sherry McNutt's use of the acreage on the\n      north side of that for the full use and enjoyment of the house?\n\n      A. No.\n\nRR 1; p. 157, ll. 19-24.\n\nTestimony of Tom Mayo\n\n      Q. All right, and what -- did he ever refer to any restrictions on\n      Sherry's use, occupation, possession of that acreage on the north side\n      of I-10?\n\n      A. No. It was her place.\n\nRR 1; p. 194; ll. 3-7.\n\nTestimony of Sherry McNutt\n      Q. All right. So the residence that's on that north side which is I guess\n      referred to sometimes as the foreman's house?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      Q. Did you -- when you moved back, did you occupy that residence?\n\n      A. There was construction going on when I first moved back.\n\n      Q. All right.\n\n      A. When my parents were aware that I was coming, they had asked\n      me to come, they started to fix it up. I actually stayed with my parents\n      in their home until an unfortunate accident -- I mean, incident that the\n      carpenters were terminated, and so I moved in with the house\n      unfinished really, and I finished it myself.\n\n      Q. Okay. Now, Mr. Ross who testified as our first witness here --\n\n      A. Uh-huh.\n\n      Q. -- he testified that he worked and did work on that ranch shortly\n      after you came back and that you did too. Correct or not correct?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. All right, and so you worked yourself to make improvements to\n      that house?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. And for what period of time do you suspect that it was -- that you\n      worked and did clean-up, paint-up, fix-up?\n\n      A. It was ongoing.\n\n      Q. Okay, and from 1983 till what period of time did you more or less\n      have the full occupancy of that residence on the north side?\n\n      A. Until the lawyers and accountants and my dad became ill and my\n      sister showed up.\n\nRR 1; p. 243, l. 20 – p. 245, l. 3\n\n      Q. And Exhibit No. 3[sic], how do -- how do they refer to that house\n      on there, the foreman's house that you --\n\n      A. Your house.\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      Q. Your home or your house?\n\n      A. I'm sorry. \"Your home.\" Yes.\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. All right, and was that consistent or inconsistent with his conduct\n      all the way up to that point?\n\n      A. Consistent.\n\nRR 1; p. 259. ll. 2-13\n\n      Q. And describe the conversation that you had with your father when\n      he gave you that foreman's house.\n\n      A. He called me in Colorado and asked me to come home. The\n      foreman had died in 1981. He and mother tried to -- to run the ranch\n      themselves and were, I guess, incapable of -- they didn't want to do it\n      anymore. So they asked me to come home to run the ranch, and he\n      would give me half the ranch.\n\n      Q. It's your testimony that in 1981, your daddy wasn't capable of\n      running that ranch. Is that what you just testified to?\n\n      A. That's what he told me in '83. I went home in '83. He ran it from\n      '81 into '83.\n\n      Q. Okay. So he called you --\n\n      A. Or he and mother did.\n\n      Q. He called you and what did he say?\n\n      A. If I would come home and run the ranch, he would give me half the\n      ranch.\n\n      Q. Okay, and -- and he said he would give you half the ranch.\n\n      A. Yeah.\n\n      Q. Something in the future.\n\n                                        10\n\f      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. Not necessarily in the future.\n\n      Q. But didn't you just say --\n\n      A. He gave it to me when I went home.\n\nRR 2; p. 42, l. 10 – p. 43, l.11\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) Tell -- then tell the lady and the gentlemen of the\n      jury as closely as possible what he told you in that telephone\n      conversation in 1983.\n\n      A. That he needed me and he wanted me to come back, and of course\n      that had been my lifelong dream. He told me he would give me half\n      the ranch when I came back.\n\n      Q. Did he say which half?\n\n      A. Specifically at that time, no, but when I moved into the foreman's\n      house, it became the -- the north side --\n\n      Q. All right.\n\n      A. -- and my sister lives on the south side. Q. All right, and at that\n      point in time from\n\n      1983 -- are you sure as to the date, 1983? A. Yes.\n\n      Q. All right. So his statement, if you would come back, he would do\n      this, and you came back and therefore he did that.\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\nRR 2; p.116, l. 17 – p. 117, l. 12.\n\n      With respect to the amount of land that Appellee needed in order to enjoy\n\nher gift of the foreman’s house, Appellant testified as follows:\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f       Q. Okay. Now -- now, what kind of operations were you running on\n       the McNutt Ranch on the south side that you received a salary for?\n\n       A. Cattle, sheep, goats, deer, wild game or exotic game.\n\n       Q. All right. What about over on the other side of I-10?\n\n       A. Same.\n\n       Q. Same thing?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. What do you feel would be necessary for you to have for the full\n       use and enjoyment of that house over there on the north side of I-10?\n\n       A. Acreage enough to run those operations.\n\nRR 2; p. 10, l. 14 – p. 11, l. 2.\n\n       The only evidence introduced at trial to rebut the presumption of a gift was\n\nthat Appellant did not pay taxes on the property and that Bill McNutt did not file a\n\ngift tax return in 1983 with respect to his gift of the foreman’s house to his\n\ndaughter. However, there was plenty of evidence at trial to rebut this argument:\n\nTestimony of Tom Mayo\n\n       Q. In fact, all your properties that you've ever owned you've had a\n       warranty deed, correct, a deed of trust?\n\n       A. No.\n\n       Q. Okay. What were the circumstances that you didn't have a deed of\n       trust?\n\n       A. Land was granted to me by my father or it was going to be granted\n       by mother and father, but they didn't grant it because they wanted to\n       take certain deductions on whatever they were spending on the house\n       -- on the property, in this case land.\n\n                                         12\n\fRR 1; p.208, ll. 6-12.\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) All right. If you want the tax write-off on a piece\n      of property or an operation, isn't it -- isn't it in your best interest to\n      keep it in your name?\n\n      A. Sure.\n\nRR 1; p. 210, ll.18-22.\n\nTestimony of Sherry McNutt\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) All right. Looking at the demonstrative aid, do\n      you see pastures 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. All right. Did you have a conversation with your dad about you\n      paying the taxes on that property?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. All right, and tell the lady and the gentlemen of the jury what his\n      response was.\n\n      A. He wanted the tax write-off.\n\n      Q. All right. So he paid the taxes. He got the tax write-off.\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\nRR1; p. 238, ll.10-22.\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) Okay. What did you tell your father about paying\n      the taxes on the house?\n\n      A. I would pay them.\n\n      Q. All right. What did he say?\n\n      A. He wanted them for a write-off.\n\nRR 2; p. 21, ll. 21-25.\n\n                                         13\n\f         The evidence is undisputed that Bill McNutt delivered possession of the\n\nforeman’s house to his daughter in 1983. Since that time, Bill McNutt continually\n\nreferred to the foreman’s house as his daughter’s house. He even admitted as such\n\nin his attempts, through his attorney, to place restrictions on Appellee’s use of the\n\nhouse.     Moreover, there is evidence that Appellee made improvements to the\n\nforeman’s house. Appellants describe all of this evidence as meager; yet it was\n\nsufficient to convince a judge and a jury that William H. McNutt gave his daughter\n\nthe foreman’s house in 1983. Further, two members of this panel believed there\n\nwas enough evidence of a gift to remand this case for a new trial. Interestingly,\n\nmost of the evidence cited by Appellants’ to support their position that there was\n\nno gift comes from the first trial and has no bearing on this analysis.\n\n         Appellants argue that the evidence detailed above was not specific enough to\n\nsupport a finding that Appellee received a gift of ½ of the North Side of the ranch.\n\nInterestingly, the record is replete with objections from Appellants’ counsel\n\nwhenever anyone attempted to testify about a specific piece of property.\n\n         After reviewing all of this evidence, there is legally sufficient evidence that a\n\nreasonable fact finder could conclude that William H. McNutt gifted his daughter\n\nthe foreman’s house and an appropriate amount of land that encompassed half of\n\nthe north side of his ranch. The evidence is also factually sufficient to support the\n\njury’s findings. The only evidence that there was not a gift of the foreman’s house\n\n\n                                             14\n\fwas that William H. McNutt did not file a gift tax return and continued to pay taxes\n\non the property at issue. Given the testimony that William H. McNutt wanted to\n\ncontinue to receive tax benefits from the property, a reasonable fact finder could\n\nhave easily decided that this evidence did not negate a finding that William H.\n\nMcNutt gave the foreman’s house and an appropriate amount of land to his\n\ndaughter.\n\nIII.   The Trial Court Did Not Err In Refusing To Grant A Directed Verdict\n       Or A Judgment N.O.V.\n\n       a.     Standard of Review\n\n       A trial court may order a directed verdict in favor of a defendant when: (1) a\n\nplaintiff fails to present evidence raising a fact issue essential to the plaintiff's right\n\nof recovery; or (2) the plaintiff admits or the evidence conclusively establishes a\n\ndefense to the plaintiff's cause of action. See Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Fin. Rev.\n\nServs., Inc., 29 S. W. 3d 74, 77 (Tex. 2000). A motion for judgment n.o.v. should\n\nbe granted only if the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's findings\n\nor if a directed verdict would have been proper because a legal principle precludes\n\nrecovery. TEX. R. CIV. P. 301; see Fort Bend Cnty. Drainage Dist. v. Sbrusch, 818\n\nS. W. 2d 392, 394 (Tex. 1991).\n\n       A directed verdict is appropriate when reasonable minds can draw only one\n\nconclusion from the evidence. Collora v. Navarro, 574 S.W.2d 65, 68 (Tex.1978);\n\nM.J. Sheridan & Son Co. v. Seminole Pipeline Co., 731 S.W.2d 620, 623\n                                            15\n\f(Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, no writ). In evaluating a directed verdict, we\n\ndetermine if there was legally sufficient evidence that would support each of the\n\nelements of the cause of action. M.J. Sheridan, 731 S.W.2d at 623. If the Smiths\n\nintroduced some evidence on each of the elements for design defect, the trial court\n\nerred in granting Aqua–Flo's motion for directed verdict. Id. at 624. In evaluating\n\nthe evidence, we examine it in the light most favorable to the party against whom\n\nthe verdict was rendered, and disregard all contrary evidence and inferences.\n\nQantel Bus. Sys., Inc. v. Custom Controls, 761 S.W.2d 302, 303 (Tex.1988); M.J.\n\nSheridan, 731 S.W.2d at 623.\n\n      A trial court may disregard a jury's findings and grant a motion for JNOV\n\nonly when there is no evidence upon which the jury could have made its findings.\n\nMancorp, Inc. v. Culpepper, 802 S.W.2d 226, 227 (Tex.1990). When determining\n\nwhether the trial court erred in granting a motion for JNOV, the appellate court\n\nmust consider only the evidence and the reasonable inferences that support the\n\njury's answers. Best v. Ryan Auto Group, Inc., 786 S.W.2d 670, 671 (Tex.1990).\n\nThe record is reviewed in the light most favorable to the jury's finding, considering\n\nonly the evidence and inferences that support the finding and rejecting the\n\nevidence and inferences contrary to the finding. Navarette v. Temple Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., 706 S.W.2d 308, 309 (Tex.1986). To uphold a JNOV, the appellate court\n\nmust decide that no evidence supports the jury's findings. Mancorp, 802 S.W.2d at\n\n\n                                         16\n\f227–28; Aquila Southwest Pipeline, Inc. v. Harmony Exploration, Inc., 48 S.W.3d\n\n225, 245 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 2001, rev. denied). Richardson v. Wal–Mart\n\nStores, Inc., 963 S.W.2d 162, 164 (Tex.App.—Texarkana 1998, no pet.). The\n\nJNOV should be reversed when there is more than a scintilla of competent\n\nevidence to support the jury's finding. Aquila Southwest Pipeline, Inc., 48 S.W.3d\n\nat 245.\n\n      In City of Keller v. Wilson, the Court discussed, both from the historical and\n\nlegal perspective, the standard for review for each of the subject motions and\n\ndecided that “the standards for taking any case from the jury should be the\n\nsame…” 168 S.W.3d at 811. Whether the inclusive or exclusive standard, if\n\nproperly applied, is used to decide whether the evidence at trial would enable\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review, the resulting\n\ndecision should be the same. Id.\n\n      b.    The Evidence Was Legally Sufficient To Withstand The Motion\n            For Directed Verdict and Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding\n            the Verdict.\n\n      In the first appeal, this Court of Appeals upheld the trial court’s decision that\n\nMr. William H. McNutt had orally gifted the house, previously known as the\n\nforeman’s house, situated in the specifically identified and completely segregated\n\npart of the McNutt ranch, referred to as the “North side” and remanded to have the\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\ftrier of fact determine “an appropriate amount of acreage necessary for the full use\n\nand enjoyment of the house…”\n\n      The 13th Amended Petition, which was the live pleading at trial and\n\nadmitted into evidence, asserted that the gift of the house included 5 acres\n\nsurrounding the house and parcel 9, consisting of approximately 700 acres. The\n\ntrial court prevented direct testimony as to any particular parcel of real estate in the\n\nNorth side, and limited the testimony to an oral gift of the house and an appropriate\n\namount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house. As detailed above,\n\nthere was legally and factually sufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict.\n\nThe trial court correctly denied the motion for directed verdict and motion for\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n\nIV.   The Jury Charge Submitted To The Jury Was Correct.\n\n      The standard of review for error in the court's charge is abuse of discretion.\n\nTexas Dep't of Human Servs. v. E.B., 802 S.W.2d 647, 649 (Tex.1990). In order for\n\nthe appellate court to reverse on a jury charge error, the appellant must show\n\nharmful error. Boatland of Houston, Inc. v. Bailey, 609 S.W.2d 743, 749–50\n\n(Tex.1980); Aquila Southwest Pipeline, Inc. v. Harmony Exploration, Inc., 48\n\nS.W.3d 225, 232 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 2001, rev. denied). Error in the jury\n\ncharge is reversible only if it probably caused the rendition of an improper\n\njudgment or probably prevented the appellant from properly presenting the case on\n\n\n                                          18\n\fappeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a); Timberwalk Apts., Partners, Inc. v. Cain, 972\n\nS.W.2d 749 (Tex.1998). To determine whether an alleged error in the charge is\n\nreversible, the reviewing court must consider the pleadings of the parties, the\n\nevidence presented at trial, and the charge in its entirety. See Id at 756; Island\n\nRecreational Dev. Corp. v. Republic of Texas Sav. Ass'n, 710 S.W.2d 551, 555\n\n(Tex.1986).   An improper jury charge requires reversal only when, under the\n\ncircumstances of the case, including the charge as a whole and the statements and\n\narguments of counsel, the error was calculated to cause and probably did cause the\n\nrendition of an improper judgment. Berry Prop. Mgmt., Inc. v. Bliskey, 850 S.W.2d\n\n644, 661 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1993, writ dism'd by agr.).\n\n      Appellants’ argument is essentially that its trial strategy backfired on them.\n\nAppellants’ repeatedly objected to any testimony as to a specific parcel of land that\n\naccompanied the gift of the foreman’s house to Appellant in 1983, and the trial\n\ncourt sustained these objections. RR 1; p. 194, l.8 – p. 201, l.2; p.262, l.13 – p.275,\n\nl. 18. Appellants now complain that there is no evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding that “½ of the North Side” of the ranch was an appropriate amount of\n\nacreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house. Appellee testified at trial\n\nregarding what was necessary to fully enjoy the foreman’s house. Appellants’\n\nproposed question is tantamount to including a specific amount of damages in a\n\ndamages question.\n\n\n                                          19\n\f         The controlling issue on retrial, consistent with the “law of the case”\n\nprinciple was submitted to the jury in two questions with the proper legal standard.\n\nThe first question, the gift to Sherry McNutt of the “foreman’s” house was again\n\ndetermined by the fact finder in the affirmative. It was not submitted as an oral gift\n\nof the entire 2000 acre/North side issue, in accord with the “law of the case”\n\nprinciple. The second question was submitted to the jury in the specific language\n\nthat this Court remanded for determination and it was done within the limitation of\n\n“no oral gift of the entire 2000 acre/North side” context. Question 2 was decided\n\nby the fact finder from the testimony relevant to the amount of acres, if any, is an\n\nappropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house. The\n\ncharge submitted is verbatim from this Court’s opinion.\n\n         Question 2 permitted the jury to only determine, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, an appropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the\n\nhouse.      This Court specifically remanded the case for that same identical\n\ndetermination. Appellee understands that Judge Loving’s statements at the pre-\n\ntrial hearing as to a “presumption” were not submitted nor binding on the jury, but\n\nthis particular “foreman’s” house already determined to have been gifted to Sherry\n\nMcNutt has always been situated on the specifically identifiable North side. In the\n\ncontext of the house gift, excluding the entire 2,000 acre/North side and following\n\nthe “law of the case”, Appellee presented without objection, and with the wavier\n\n\n                                         20\n\fand acquiescence of Appellant’s trial counsel, during various cross-examination,\n\ntestimony relevant to the twenty year plus history of the possession of the house\n\nand property without limitation or restriction by William H. McNutt for Sherry\n\nMcNutt’s full use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n      Moreover, it was the Appellants that objected to any parcel within the entire\n\n2000 acre/North side, being identified, and they should not be allowed to benefit\n\nfrom the limitations they urged.\n\n      The trial court submitted its charge based on the pleadings, the oral gift\n\nexception to the statute of frauds as to the “foreman’s” house and the equitable\n\nexception concerning the developed testimony on the appropriate acreage for the\n\nfull use and enjoyment of the “foreman’s” house.\n\n      The proposed submission by the Ranch entities is not substantially correct.\n\nFirst, the proposed charge does not contain a date reference. Second, the proposed\n\ncharge is a comment on the evidence. Third, the proposed charge confuses the\n\ninitial gift of property as to the entire 2000 acres/North side, and the specific\n\nremand instruction concerning the appropriate amount of acreage for the full use\n\nand enjoyment of the “foreman’s” house. Fourth, the proposed charge sponsored a\n\nmetes and bounds description on the North side, that would have been contrary to\n\nthe completed oral gift of the “foreman’s” house and the acres to have full use and\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\fenjoyment thereof. Lastly, the proposed charge called for multi-issue resolution\n\nthat would leave any answer therein from being directly traced.\n\n      The trial court submitted the charge that reflected all the admitted evidence,\n\nwhether from direct examination or cross-examination, tried by consent, or waived,\n\nbut before the jury and the “law of the case”.\n\n      Sherry McNutt did not relitigate the 1983 oral gift of the entire 2,000\n\nacre/North side issue.    Sherry McNutt tried only the very specific fact to be\n\ndetermined on remand, and not determined in the first trial. If appellant’s position\n\nis correct, the Ranch entities might have prevailed by for a pre-trial disposition as a\n\nmatter of law. The Ranch entities allowed the fact issues, raised by the testimony,\n\nto be submitted to the jury.\n\n      Appellee’s live pleading, provided notice of the 1983 oral gift of the\n\n“foreman’s” house with the surrounding five (5) acres and parcel A that Appellee\n\nestimates as being 700 acres and in the prayer for a relief that included general\n\nrelief and specific as Appellee may show herself justly entitled.\n\n      The pleadings at trial allowed for the testimony admitted to be submitted to\n\nthe jury in the form of Question 1 and Question 2 that are within the bounds of the\n\n“law of the case” and the specific fact remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fV.    Appellants failed to properly present evidence of juror misconduct that\n      would be sufficient to set aside the jury’s verdict.\n\n      In their fifth issue, the Appellants argue that juror misconduct resulted in an\n\nimproper verdict. In support of their Amended Motion for New Trial, Appellants\n\nsubmitted the affidavit of two of the jurors, Daniel Meyer and Dale Gipson,\n\nalleging that two of the other jurors injected facts into the deliberations that were\n\noutside the evidence.\n\n      To warrant a new trial for jury misconduct, the movant must establish (1)\n\nthat the misconduct occurred, (2) it was material, and (3) probably caused injury.”\n\nGolden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 24 S.W.3d 362, 372 (Tex.2000). Jurors are\n\nprohibited from testifying about matters and statements occurring during\n\ndeliberations. Tex. R. Civ. P. 327(b); Id. at 370. Proof of a juror’s failure to\n\ndisclose bias must come from some source other than a fellow juror’s testimony\n\nabout deliberations.” Id.\n\n      The evidence presented by Appellants relates to statements allegedly made\n\nby jurors during deliberations and is not provided from a source outside the jury.\n\nAs such, the affidavits presented by Appellants are inadmissible to show jury\n\nmisconduct. Accordingly, this Court should overrule Appellants’ Issue Number 5.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      Three fact finders have determined that William H. McNutt in 1983 gave his\n\ndaughter, Sherry McNutt, the foreman’s house.         On remand, Sherry McNutt\n                                         23\n\fpresented evidence of her own ranching operations, cattle and sheep and goats,\n\nlater Sherry McNutt and William McNutt, together and separately, ventured into\n\nthe exotic market. Sherry McNutt managed William H. McNutt’s exotics on the\n\n“South” side of the ranch until 2001, when William H. McNutt gave all the wild\n\ngame to Mrs. Johnie Beth McNutt and Sherry McNutt including the income from\n\nhunting and the sale of exotics. Never during William H. McNutt’s lifetime did he\n\nundertake an act inconsistent with the completed gift in 1983, no limitation in the\n\nuse of the “North” side as exercised by Sherry McNutt. Sherry McNutt committed\n\nher life to the 1983 gift by William H. McNutt, she believed and relied upon the\n\nword of her dad, as a true Texan, a man’s word is his bond, plus William H.\n\nMcNutt was her trusted and confidential companion, to undo William H. McNutt’s\n\nword is a detriment to Sherry McNutt.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      Appellee, Sherry McNutt, prays that the Court will affirm the judgment of\n\nthe trial court, and for such further relief to which she may be entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n                                              /s/ Gene Garcia\n                                             GENE GARCIA\n                                             State Bar No. 07634500\n                                             809 S.

McNutt\n\nmade a gift of the north 2000 acres of his ranch to his daughter, Sherry McNutt,\n\nAppellee, in 1983.     The trial court found that William H. McNutt gifted the\n\n“foreman’s house” and five acres of land that was located on the north 2000 acres\n\nof his ranch, but also found that he did not gift the entire north side of the ranch to\n\n\n                                           1\n\fher. The case was appealed to this court which upheld the decision that there was\n\nnot a gift of the entire north side of the ranch, but remanded the case for a new trial\n\non the issues of whether there was a gift of the foreman’s house and an appropriate\n\namount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n      After the second trial, the jury once again found that William H. McNutt\n\ngifted the foreman’s house to Appellee and that “1/2 of the North Side” was the\n\nnecessary amount of land to allow Appellee an appropriate amount of acreage for\n\nthe full use and enjoyment of the house. Appellants have appealed the judgment of\n\nthe trial court awarding Appellee the foreman’s house and ½ of the North Side of\n\nthe ranch.\n\n              STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellee does not believe that oral argument will aid this Court in\n\ndetermining the issues presented by this appeal. The facts in this case are straight-\n\nforward and the issues in this case have previously been addressed by this Court.\n\n\n                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      In 1983, William H. McNutt called his daughter, Appellee, Sherry McNutt,\n\nand asked her to return to the ranch and run it for him. William H. McNutt told\n\nSherry McNutt that if she agreed to return half the ranch was hers. Sherry McNutt\n\nreturned to the ranch, made substantial improvements to the foreman’s house and\n\nto the surrounding area, garden, and barns. She ran two operations, livestock and\n\n                                          2\n\fgoats and sheep, until the family and herself ventured into exotics. Sherry McNutt\n\nmanaged the South side exotic operation for her dad, William H. McNutt until\n\n2001 when William H. McNutt gave the all the wildlife to Mrs. McNutt and to\n\nSherry McNutt including the income thereof.\n\n      At no time prior to his death did William H. McNutt ever try to dispossess\n\nSherry McNutt of the foreman’s house. William never sought to undo the finality\n\nof the 1983 gift of the foreman’s house and the appropriate amount of acreage for\n\nthe full use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n      After a bench trial in 2011, Judge Loving found that William H. McNutt\n\ngave the foreman’s house to Sherry McNutt. On appeal, this Court found that\n\nthere was sufficient evidence of a gift of the foreman’s house and remanded the\n\ncase to determine the appropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment\n\nof the house. After a second trial, the jury again found that William H. McNutt\n\ngave the foreman’s house to Sherry McNutt, and after hearing the testimony the\n\njury found that ½ of the North Side was the appropriate amount of acreage for the\n\nfull use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The gift of the foreman’s house legally meets the requirements of an oral gift\n\nof real property. The evidence at trial establishes that William H. McNutt gave the\n\nforeman’s house to Sherry McNutt in 1983. Since the evidence at trial was legally\n\n\n                                           3\n\fand factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding of a gift to Sherry McNutt, the\n\nCourt did not err in refusing to grant the Appellant’s Motion for Directed Verdict\n\nand Motion for Judgment N.O.V.\n\n       This case was remanded for the determination of two issues: (1) was there an\n\noral gift of the foreman’s house to Appellee, and; (2) what amount of land an\n\nappropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house. These\n\nissues were correctly submitted to the jury in the form of the jury charge given by\n\nthe trial court.\n\n       Although Appellants argue that misconduct occurred during the jury\n\ndeliberations, they have failed to present any admissible evidence of the alleged\n\nmisconduct.\n\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\n   I. Oral Gifts of Real Property.\n\n       There are three elements required to establish an oral gift of real property:\n\n(1) a gift in praesenti, (2) possession under the gift by the donee with the donor's\n\nconsent, and (3) permanent and valuable improvements made on the property by\n\nthe donee with the donor's knowledge or consent or, without improvements, the\n\nexistence of such facts as would make it a fraud upon the donee not to enforce the\n\ngift.

McNutt gave Appellee the\n      foreman’s house and ½ of the North Side in 1983.\n\n      Appellants’ fourth issue challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that William H. McNutt gave the foreman’s\n\nhouse and ½ of the North Side of the ranch in 1983. A review of the testimony at\n\ntrial shows that the overwhelming weight of the evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfindings.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      a.     Appellate Review of Clear and Convincing Evidence.\n\n\n      When the burden of proof at trial requires clear and convincing evidence, the\n\nCourt of Appeals must review the sufficiency of the evidence by giving “due\n\nconsideration to evidence that the fact finder could reasonably have found to be\n\nclear and convincing.” In re J.F.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377577/in-re-jfc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (Tex. 2002); (relying on In\n\nre C.H., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1353786\"><a href=\"/opinion/1353786/in-re-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (Tex.2002)); In re C.E., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491243\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491243/in-re-ce/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370\n\n(Tex.App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.).

In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d at 266. Unless the Court determines that\n\nno reasonable fact finder could form a firm belief or conviction that the fact is true,\n\nthe Court must conclude that the evidence is legally sufficient.

Testimony of Witnesses at Trial.\n\n      The following testimony supports the jury’s verdict that William H. McNutt\n\ngave his daughter the foreman’s hours in 1983:\n\nTestimony of David Ross\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) Now, Mr. Ross, regarding the house that's on the\n      north side of I-10 on the McNutt Ranch --\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. -- did you ever have any conversations with Bill McNutt regarding\n      that house?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. What did he tell you?\n\n      A. Well, that it was the previous ranch foreman's house and that it was\n      given to Sherry. In fact, I helped Sherry remodel that house, helped\n      her furnish it, spent time there as a guest with other projects that she\n      worked on around there, building barns, building her gardens,\n      landscaping, et cetera.\n\n      Q. All right. My question to you, sir, was Bill McNutt clear or unclear\n      about that statement that you just made?\n\n      A. I felt it was clear.\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f      Q. All right, and my second part of my question was, was his\n      statement to you convincing or unconvincing?\n\n      A. It would be convincing.\n\n      Q. All right, and through the years that you went out to the McNutt\n      Ranch, did you ever hear Bill McNutt make any statements in\n      contravention of what you just testified to?\n\n      A. No. I did not.\n\n      Q. All right. So the home that's on the north side, to paraphrase your\n      testimony, he said that's Sherry's home.\n\n      A. Correct.\n\nRR 1; p. 153, l. 15 – p. 154, l. 20.\n\n      Q. All right. Now -- so from the time that you met him, your\n      testimony is never at any time did he ever modify, retract, or make\n      any statements regarding Sherry McNutt's use of the acreage on the\n      north side of that for the full use and enjoyment of the house?\n\n      A. No.\n\nRR 1; p. 157, ll. 19-24.\n\nTestimony of Tom Mayo\n\n      Q. All right, and what -- did he ever refer to any restrictions on\n      Sherry's use, occupation, possession of that acreage on the north side\n      of I-10?\n\n      A. No. It was her place.\n\nRR 1; p. 194; ll. 3-7.\n\nTestimony of Sherry McNutt\n      Q. All right. So the residence that's on that north side which is I guess\n      referred to sometimes as the foreman's house?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      Q. Did you -- when you moved back, did you occupy that residence?\n\n      A. There was construction going on when I first moved back.\n\n      Q. All right.\n\n      A. When my parents were aware that I was coming, they had asked\n      me to come, they started to fix it up. I actually stayed with my parents\n      in their home until an unfortunate accident -- I mean, incident that the\n      carpenters were terminated, and so I moved in with the house\n      unfinished really, and I finished it myself.\n\n      Q. Okay. Now, Mr. Ross who testified as our first witness here --\n\n      A. Uh-huh.\n\n      Q. -- he testified that he worked and did work on that ranch shortly\n      after you came back and that you did too. Correct or not correct?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. All right, and so you worked yourself to make improvements to\n      that house?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. And for what period of time do you suspect that it was -- that you\n      worked and did clean-up, paint-up, fix-up?\n\n      A. It was ongoing.\n\n      Q. Okay, and from 1983 till what period of time did you more or less\n      have the full occupancy of that residence on the north side?\n\n      A. Until the lawyers and accountants and my dad became ill and my\n      sister showed up.\n\nRR 1; p. 243, l. 20 – p. 245, l. 3\n\n      Q. And Exhibit No. 3[sic], how do -- how do they refer to that house\n      on there, the foreman's house that you --\n\n      A. Your house.\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      Q. Your home or your house?\n\n      A. I'm sorry. \"Your home.\" Yes.\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. All right, and was that consistent or inconsistent with his conduct\n      all the way up to that point?\n\n      A. Consistent.\n\nRR 1; p. 259. ll. 2-13\n\n      Q. And describe the conversation that you had with your father when\n      he gave you that foreman's house.\n\n      A. He called me in Colorado and asked me to come home. The\n      foreman had died in 1981. He and mother tried to -- to run the ranch\n      themselves and were, I guess, incapable of -- they didn't want to do it\n      anymore. So they asked me to come home to run the ranch, and he\n      would give me half the ranch.\n\n      Q. It's your testimony that in 1981, your daddy wasn't capable of\n      running that ranch. Is that what you just testified to?\n\n      A. That's what he told me in '83. I went home in '83. He ran it from\n      '81 into '83.\n\n      Q. Okay. So he called you --\n\n      A. Or he and mother did.\n\n      Q. He called you and what did he say?\n\n      A. If I would come home and run the ranch, he would give me half the\n      ranch.\n\n      Q. Okay, and -- and he said he would give you half the ranch.\n\n      A. Yeah.\n\n      Q. Something in the future.\n\n                                        10\n\f      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. Not necessarily in the future.\n\n      Q. But didn't you just say --\n\n      A. He gave it to me when I went home.\n\nRR 2; p. 42, l. 10 – p. 43, l.11\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) Tell -- then tell the lady and the gentlemen of the\n      jury as closely as possible what he told you in that telephone\n      conversation in 1983.\n\n      A. That he needed me and he wanted me to come back, and of course\n      that had been my lifelong dream. He told me he would give me half\n      the ranch when I came back.\n\n      Q. Did he say which half?\n\n      A. Specifically at that time, no, but when I moved into the foreman's\n      house, it became the -- the north side --\n\n      Q. All right.\n\n      A. -- and my sister lives on the south side. Q. All right, and at that\n      point in time from\n\n      1983 -- are you sure as to the date, 1983? A. Yes.\n\n      Q. All right. So his statement, if you would come back, he would do\n      this, and you came back and therefore he did that.\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\nRR 2; p.116, l. 17 – p. 117, l. 12.\n\n      With respect to the amount of land that Appellee needed in order to enjoy\n\nher gift of the foreman’s house, Appellant testified as follows:\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f       Q. Okay. Now -- now, what kind of operations were you running on\n       the McNutt Ranch on the south side that you received a salary for?\n\n       A. Cattle, sheep, goats, deer, wild game or exotic game.\n\n       Q. All right. What about over on the other side of I-10?\n\n       A. Same.\n\n       Q. Same thing?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. What do you feel would be necessary for you to have for the full\n       use and enjoyment of that house over there on the north side of I-10?\n\n       A. Acreage enough to run those operations.\n\nRR 2; p. 10, l. 14 – p. 11, l. 2.\n\n       The only evidence introduced at trial to rebut the presumption of a gift was\n\nthat Appellant did not pay taxes on the property and that Bill McNutt did not file a\n\ngift tax return in 1983 with respect to his gift of the foreman’s house to his\n\ndaughter. However, there was plenty of evidence at trial to rebut this argument:\n\nTestimony of Tom Mayo\n\n       Q. In fact, all your properties that you've ever owned you've had a\n       warranty deed, correct, a deed of trust?\n\n       A. No.\n\n       Q. Okay. What were the circumstances that you didn't have a deed of\n       trust?\n\n       A. Land was granted to me by my father or it was going to be granted\n       by mother and father, but they didn't grant it because they wanted to\n       take certain deductions on whatever they were spending on the house\n       -- on the property, in this case land.\n\n                                         12\n\fRR 1; p.208, ll. 6-12.\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) All right. If you want the tax write-off on a piece\n      of property or an operation, isn't it -- isn't it in your best interest to\n      keep it in your name?\n\n      A. Sure.\n\nRR 1; p. 210, ll.18-22.\n\nTestimony of Sherry McNutt\n\n      Q. (By Mr. Nichols) All right.

Did you have a conversation with your dad about you\n      paying the taxes on that property?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. All right, and tell the lady and the gentlemen of the jury what his\n      response was.\n\n      A. He wanted the tax write-off.\n\n      Q. All right. So he paid the taxes.

I would pay them.\n\n      Q. All right. What did he say?\n\n      A. He wanted them for a write-off.\n\nRR 2; p. 21, ll. 21-25.\n\n                                         13\n\f         The evidence is undisputed that Bill McNutt delivered possession of the\n\nforeman’s house to his daughter in 1983. Since that time, Bill McNutt continually\n\nreferred to the foreman’s house as his daughter’s house. He even admitted as such\n\nin his attempts, through his attorney, to place restrictions on Appellee’s use of the\n\nhouse.     Moreover, there is evidence that Appellee made improvements to the\n\nforeman’s house. Appellants describe all of this evidence as meager; yet it was\n\nsufficient to convince a judge and a jury that William H. McNutt gave his daughter\n\nthe foreman’s house in 1983. Further, two members of this panel believed there\n\nwas enough evidence of a gift to remand this case for a new trial. Interestingly,\n\nmost of the evidence cited by Appellants’ to support their position that there was\n\nno gift comes from the first trial and has no bearing on this analysis.\n\n         Appellants argue that the evidence detailed above was not specific enough to\n\nsupport a finding that Appellee received a gift of ½ of the North Side of the ranch.\n\nInterestingly, the record is replete with objections from Appellants’ counsel\n\nwhenever anyone attempted to testify about a specific piece of property.\n\n         After reviewing all of this evidence, there is legally sufficient evidence that a\n\nreasonable fact finder could conclude that William H. McNutt gifted his daughter\n\nthe foreman’s house and an appropriate amount of land that encompassed half of\n\nthe north side of his ranch. The evidence is also factually sufficient to support the\n\njury’s findings. The only evidence that there was not a gift of the foreman’s house\n\n\n                                             14\n\fwas that William H. McNutt did not file a gift tax return and continued to pay taxes\n\non the property at issue. Given the testimony that William H. McNutt wanted to\n\ncontinue to receive tax benefits from the property, a reasonable fact finder could\n\nhave easily decided that this evidence did not negate a finding that William H.\n\nMcNutt gave the foreman’s house and an appropriate amount of land to his\n\ndaughter.\n\nIII.

The\n\ntrial court prevented direct testimony as to any particular parcel of real estate in the\n\nNorth side, and limited the testimony to an oral gift of the house and an appropriate\n\namount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house.

RR 1; p. 194, l.8 – p. 201, l.2; p.262, l.13 – p.275,\n\nl. 18. Appellants now complain that there is no evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding that “½ of the North Side” of the ranch was an appropriate amount of\n\nacreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house. Appellee testified at trial\n\nregarding what was necessary to fully enjoy the foreman’s house. Appellants’\n\nproposed question is tantamount to including a specific amount of damages in a\n\ndamages question.\n\n\n                                          19\n\f         The controlling issue on retrial, consistent with the “law of the case”\n\nprinciple was submitted to the jury in two questions with the proper legal standard.\n\nThe first question, the gift to Sherry McNutt of the “foreman’s” house was again\n\ndetermined by the fact finder in the affirmative. It was not submitted as an oral gift\n\nof the entire 2000 acre/North side issue, in accord with the “law of the case”\n\nprinciple. The second question was submitted to the jury in the specific language\n\nthat this Court remanded for determination and it was done within the limitation of\n\n“no oral gift of the entire 2000 acre/North side” context. Question 2 was decided\n\nby the fact finder from the testimony relevant to the amount of acres, if any, is an\n\nappropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the house. The\n\ncharge submitted is verbatim from this Court’s opinion.\n\n         Question 2 permitted the jury to only determine, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, an appropriate amount of acreage for the full use and enjoyment of the\n\nhouse.      This Court specifically remanded the case for that same identical\n\ndetermination. Appellee understands that Judge Loving’s statements at the pre-\n\ntrial hearing as to a “presumption” were not submitted nor binding on the jury, but\n\nthis particular “foreman’s” house already determined to have been gifted to Sherry\n\nMcNutt has always been situated on the specifically identifiable North side. In the\n\ncontext of the house gift, excluding the entire 2,000 acre/North side and following\n\nthe “law of the case”, Appellee presented without objection, and with the wavier\n\n\n                                         20\n\fand acquiescence of Appellant’s trial counsel, during various cross-examination,\n\ntestimony relevant to the twenty year plus history of the possession of the house\n\nand property without limitation or restriction by William H. McNutt for Sherry\n\nMcNutt’s full use and enjoyment of the house.\n\n      Moreover, it was the Appellants that objected to any parcel within the entire\n\n2000 acre/North side, being identified, and they should not be allowed to benefit\n\nfrom the limitations they urged.\n\n      The trial court submitted its charge based on the pleadings, the oral gift\n\nexception to the statute of frauds as to the “foreman’s” house and the equitable\n\nexception concerning the developed testimony on the appropriate acreage for the\n\nfull use and enjoyment of the “foreman’s” house.\n\n      The proposed submission by the Ranch entities is not substantially correct.\n\nFirst, the proposed charge does not contain a date reference. Second, the proposed\n\ncharge is a comment on the evidence. Third, the proposed charge confuses the\n\ninitial gift of property as to the entire 2000 acres/North side, and the specific\n\nremand instruction concerning the appropriate amount of acreage for the full use\n\nand enjoyment of the “foreman’s” house. Fourth, the proposed charge sponsored a\n\nmetes and bounds description on the North side, that would have been contrary to\n\nthe completed oral gift of the “foreman’s” house and the acres to have full use and\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\fenjoyment thereof. Lastly, the proposed charge called for multi-issue resolution\n\nthat would leave any answer therein from being directly traced.\n\n      The trial court submitted the charge that reflected all the admitted evidence,\n\nwhether from direct examination or cross-examination, tried by consent, or waived,\n\nbut before the jury and the “law of the case”.\n\n      Sherry McNutt did not relitigate the 1983 oral gift of the entire 2,000\n\nacre/North side issue.    Sherry McNutt tried only the very specific fact to be\n\ndetermined on remand, and not determined in the first trial. If appellant’s position\n\nis correct, the Ranch entities might have prevailed by for a pre-trial disposition as a\n\nmatter of law. The Ranch entities allowed the fact issues, raised by the testimony,\n\nto be submitted to the jury.\n\n      Appellee’s live pleading, provided notice of the 1983 oral gift of the\n\n“foreman’s” house with the surrounding five (5) acres and parcel A that Appellee\n\nestimates as being 700 acres and in the prayer for a relief that included general\n\nrelief and specific as Appellee may show herself justly entitled.\n\n      The pleadings at trial allowed for the testimony admitted to be submitted to\n\nthe jury in the form of Question 1 and Question 2 that are within the bounds of the\n\n“law of the case” and the specific fact remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fV.    Appellants failed to properly present evidence of juror misconduct that\n      would be sufficient to set aside the jury’s verdict.\n\n      In their fifth issue, the Appellants argue that juror misconduct resulted in an\n\nimproper verdict. In support of their Amended Motion for New Trial, Appellants\n\nsubmitted the affidavit of two of the jurors, Daniel Meyer and Dale Gipson,\n\nalleging that two of the other jurors injected facts into the deliberations that were\n\noutside the evidence.\n\n      To warrant a new trial for jury misconduct, the movant must establish (1)\n\nthat the misconduct occurred, (2) it was material, and (3) probably caused injury.”\n\nGolden Eagle Archery, Inc. v.

Proof of a juror’s failure to\n\ndisclose bias must come from some source other than a fellow juror’s testimony\n\nabout deliberations.” Id.\n\n      The evidence presented by Appellants relates to statements allegedly made\n\nby jurors during deliberations and is not provided from a source outside the jury.\n\nAs such, the affidavits presented by Appellants are inadmissible to show jury\n\nmisconduct. Accordingly, this Court should overrule Appellants’ Issue Number 5.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      Three fact finders have determined that William H. McNutt in 1983 gave his\n\ndaughter, Sherry McNutt, the foreman’s house.         On remand, Sherry McNutt\n                                         23\n\fpresented evidence of her own ranching operations, cattle and sheep and goats,\n\nlater Sherry McNutt and William McNutt, together and separately, ventured into\n\nthe exotic market. Sherry McNutt managed William H. McNutt’s exotics on the\n\n“South” side of the ranch until 2001, when William H. McNutt gave all the wild\n\ngame to Mrs. Johnie Beth McNutt and Sherry McNutt including the income from\n\nhunting and the sale of exotics. Never during William H. McNutt’s lifetime did he\n\nundertake an act inconsistent with the completed gift in 1983, no limitation in the\n\nuse of the “North” side as exercised by Sherry McNutt. Sherry McNutt committed\n\nher life to the 1983 gift by William H. McNutt, she believed and relied upon the\n\nword of her dad, as a true Texan, a man’s word is his bond, plus William H.\n\nMcNutt was her trusted and confidential companion, to undo William H. McNutt’s\n\nword is a detriment to Sherry McNutt.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      Appellee, Sherry McNutt, prays that the Court will affirm the judgment of\n\nthe trial court, and for such further relief to which she may be entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n                                              /s/ Gene Garcia\n                                             GENE GARCIA\n                                             State Bar No. 07634500\n                                             809 S.
