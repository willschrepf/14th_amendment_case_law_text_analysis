Ct. No. SCV 226091)\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         Martin Reilley purports to appeal from a “final judgment after remand” entered on\nMarch 19, 2013, though the appeal seeks to review an order denying attorney fees entered\nmore than a year earlier on February 6, 2012. Don and Kathy Zeppenfeld (respondents)\nhave moved for sanctions and attorney fees, contending that the appeal is frivolous. We\ndismiss the appeal and remand the matter to the trial court for a determination of the\namount of attorney fees to be awarded on appeal.\n                                   I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n         We have previously set forth the underlying facts in this action in Zeppenfeld v.\nReilley (Dec. 21, 2007, A110461 [nonpub. opn.]. In summary, we affirmed the jury\nverdict in favor of respondents on their fraud cause of action against Reilley which arose\nin connection with the construction of a new home in Santa Rosa. In addition, we\nreversed the trial court’s order granting Reilley’s motion for summary adjudication of\nrespondents’ causes of action for breach of contract and breach of express warranty,\nconcluding that there were triable issues of fact on whether the contract between the\nparties encompassed an agreement to repair leaks on the property, whether repairs were\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fwarranted and whether the warranties were disclaimed by the contract. We therefore\nremanded the matter for further proceedings.\n       This court issued the remittitur in the action on April 25, 2008. Respondents\nproceeded to make attempts to execute on the judgment. They abandoned their\ncontractual causes of action.\n       On August 1, 2008, the trial court notified the parties that all trial exhibits would\nbe destroyed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1952 unless either party\nrequested preservation of the exhibits or made arrangements to withdraw them. Counsel\nfor respondents assumed that the court would thereafter close its file.\n       Instead, on May 12, 2011, Reilley moved for mandatory dismissal of the action\npursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.320, subdivision (a)(3), for failure to\nbring the matter to trial within three years of the filing of the remittitur. Respondents\nopposed the motion and filed a request for voluntary dismissal with prejudice of the\ncontract and warranty causes of action. On July 14, 2011, the trial court granted Reilley’s\nmotion, and ordered the breach of contract and breach of express warranty causes of\naction dismissed with prejudice pursuant to section 583.320, subdivision (a)(3).\n       On September 15, 2011, Reilly moved for attorney fees contending that he was\nentitled to an award of attorney fees because he was successful in the defense of the\ncontract causes of action in respondents’ complaint. The trial court denied the motion. It\nfound that it was bound by Judge Champlin’s August 16, 2005 ruling that respondents\nwere the prevailing party under a broad contractual clause for attorney fees. 1 The court\nnoted that “Judge Champlin impliedly found the work on the various causes of action to\nbe too intertwined for segregation.” On February 10, 2012, the court entered notice of\nentry of the order denying Reilley’s motion for attorney fees.\n       On March 19, 2013, the court, upon Reilley’s request, entered a “Final Judgment\nAfter Remand” setting forth the judgment, attorney fees, and costs order entered in favor\nof respondents in 2005, the 2011 order dismissing the contract causes of action that were\n\n       1\n       The trial court awarded respondents their attorney fees through May 19, 2005, in\nthe amount of $519,063.78.\n\n                                              2\n\fthe subject of Reilleys’ mandatory dismissal motion, and the 2012 order denying his\nmotion for attorney fees. Reilley filed a notice of appeal on May 10, 2013.\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n       Respondents contend that the appeal must be dismissed because it is untimely.\nWe agree.\n       An order denying an award of attorney fees is appealable as an order entered after\njudgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(2). (Lakin v.\nWatkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 654–655; Whiteside v. Tenet\nHealthcare Corp. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 693, 706.) The order denying Reilley attorney\nfees here contemplated no further action, and disposed of all of the issues between the\nparties. (See Laraway v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 579, 582\n(Laraway).) The subsequent March 13 judgment, entered over a year later, summarized\nthe proceedings in the case, reiterated the judgment entered in favor of respondents on\nAugust 16, 2005, and noted the 2011 dismissal of respondents’ breach of contract and\nexpress warranty causes of action and the denial of Reilley’s motion for attorney fees in\n2012. The 2011 dismissal constituted a judgment under section 581d. The subsequent\nMarch 2013 judgment added nothing to the judgment and orders already entered in the\ncase. “Once a final, appealable order or judgment has been entered, the time to appeal\nbegins to run. The Rules of Court do not provide, once a judgment or appealable order\nhas been entered, that the time to appeal can be restarted or extended by the filing of a\nsubsequent judgment or appealable order making the same decision.” (Id. at p. 583.)\n       Here, the trial court entered the order denying Reilley’s motion for attorney fees\non February 6, 2012. Respondents served notice of entry of the order denying Reilley’s\nmotion for an award of attorney fees on February 10, 2012. Reilley was therefore\nrequired to serve the notice of appeal within 60 days of the notice of entry of the order.\n(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.104(a)(1)(B).)\n       “Compliance with the time for filing a notice of appeal is mandatory and\njurisdictional. [Citation.] If a notice of appeal is not timely, the appellate court must\ndismiss the appeal.” (Laraway, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at p. 582.) Because Reilley failed\n\n\n                                              3\n\fto timely appeal the court’s order denying his motion for attorney fees within 60 days\nafter the February 10, 2012 notice of entry of the order, his appeal, filed on May 10,\n2013, was untimely and must be dismissed.\n          Respondents move for sanctions and request attorney fees contending that\nReilley’s appeal is frivolous and “obvious litigation gamesmanship.” We agree that the\nappeal is frivolous; it has no arguable merit and appears to have been brought for an\nimproper motive. We need not decide, however, whether sanctions are appropriate.\nRespondents are entitled to fees as the prevailing parties pursuant to the contract\nprovision in the real estate purchase contract between the parties. (Amtower v. Photon\nDynamics, Inc. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1582, 1610 [where party is entitled by contract to\nrecover fees as the prevailing party, right includes fees incurred on appeal].) While we\nhave the power to decide the amount of fees to be awarded on appeal, the better practice\nis to remand the matter to the trial court to determine the appropriate amount of fees.\n(Ibid.)\n                                     III. DISPOSITION\n          The appeal is dismissed. Respondents are to recover their costs and attorney fees\non appeal. The matter is remanded to the trial court for a determination of the amount of\nattorney fees to be awarded on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                   _________________________\n                                                   Rivera, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nReardon, Acting P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nHumes, J.\n\n\n                                               4\n\f",
