St. Clair.    For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n              I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiffs-Appellants1 are students and parents of students\n\nwho attend schools situated in the Forney Independent School\n\nDistrict (“Forney”) in Forney, Texas.    Plaintiffs-Appellants sued\n\nDefendants-Appellees asserting several constitutional challenges\n\nto the mandatory school uniform policy (“Uniform Policy” or\n\n“Policy”) adopted by Forney.    Defendants-Appellees are Forney;\n\nChester St. Clair, General Superintendent of Forney; and Keith\n\nBell, Kenneth Cleaver, Clarence Doggan, Jay Calvin, Jim Jacobs,\n\nRick Townsend, and David Walker, Members of the Forney Board of\n\nTrustees (collectively referred to hereinafter as “Defendants”).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        Plaintiffs-Appellants are Sissy Littlefield, David\nLittlefield, Joel Odom, Susan Becmer, Nicholas Becmer, Jonathan\nBecmer, Stan Bland, Glenda Bland, Jennifer Bland, Jeffery Bland,\nSteve Calvery, Greta Calvery, Ashley Calvery, Scott Ryan Calvery,\nLenny McKinney, Opal McKinney, Beverly McKinney, Rebecca\nMcKinney, Virginia McLaren, Natalie Johnson, Tom Napper, Brandi\nNapper, Kevin Napper, Chelsea Napper, Mary Penn, Haley Penn,\nLynzi Anderson, Drew Anderson, William Tapley, Norma Tapley,\nKaytie Elizabeth Tapley, Cindy Woods, Dustin Woods, Benjamin\nWoods, Chad Woods, Aaron Woods, Tammy Winner, Mark Winner, Ryan\nWinner, Daniel Ingram, Cliff Clipp, Kim Clipp, Michael Lamberth,\nCash Clipp, Joe Don Law, Brad Law, David Lowery, Vinita Lowery,\nand Madeline Lowery.\n\n                                  2\n\f     In the spring of 1999, Forney, acting pursuant to Texas\n\nEducation Code § 11.1622 adopted a district-wide mandatory\n\nUniform Policy applicable to its students.    The Uniform Policy\n\napparently originated as a result of the efforts of General\n\nSuperintendent St. Clair, who observed the successful\n\nimplementation of uniform policies employed in other Texas school\n\ndistricts.   In addition to St. Clair, school board members and\n\nschool officials conferred with their counterparts at other Texas\n\npublic schools and reviewed studies on the efficacy of school\n\nuniform policies.   As found by the district court,\n\n     St. Clair came to the conclusion that the implementation of\n     a school uniform program would, according to his research,\n     have the following beneficial effects on the students and\n     the system as a whole: improve student performance, instill\n\n     2\n        Section 11.162 of the Texas Education Code provides in\nrelevant part:\n\n     (a) The board of trustees of an independent school district\n     may adopt rules that require students at a school in the\n     district to wear school uniforms if the board determines\n     that the requirement would improve the learning environment\n     at the school.\n     (b) The rules the board of trustees adopts must designate a\n     source of funding that shall be used in providing uniforms\n     for students at the school who are educationally\n     disadvantaged.\n     (c) A parent or guardian of a student assigned to attend a\n     school at which students are required to wear school\n     uniforms may choose for the student to be exempted from the\n     requirement or to transfer to a school at which students are\n     not required to wear uniforms and at which space is\n     available if the parent or guardian provides a written\n     statement that, as determined by the board of trustees,\n     states a bona fide religious or philosophical objection to\n     the requirement.\n\nSee TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 11.162 (Vernon 1996).\n\n                                 3\n\f     self-confidence, foster self-esteem, increase attendance,\n     decrease disciplinary referrals, and lower drop-out rates.\n\nSee Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist., 108 F. Supp. 2d 681,\n\n686 (N.D. Tex. 2000).   Forney also sought input from parents\n\nregarding the proposed Policy.    In March 1999, a “take-home”\n\nsurvey was sent home with elementary, middle, and junior-high\n\nschool students in order to elicit parental approval of the\n\nproposed Uniform Policy.   The district court found that, of the\n\nthirty-four percent of parents who responded, approximately sixty\n\npercent of that group was in favor of mandatory uniforms.    Forney\n\nalso conducted two “town hall” style meetings on the subject.    At\n\nthese meetings, parents were provided the opportunity to comment\n\non the proposed Uniform Policy.\n\n     As a result of this information, the Forney School Board\n\nmade factual findings that the school uniforms would improve the\n\nlearning environment at the schools, and on April 19, 1999,\n\nadopted the Uniform Policy now at issue.    The Uniform Policy\n\napplied to all 2,500 students in each of the schools within the\n\ndistrict and was implemented at the beginning of the 1999-2000\n\nschool year.\n\n     The disputed Uniform Policy requires students to wear solid\n\ncolor polo-type shirts with collars, oxford-type shirts, or\n\nblouses with collars in one of four colors (white, yellow, red,\n\n\n\n\n                                  4\n\for navy blue).3    The shirts may be either short- or long-sleeved\n\nbut must be tucked in at all times.    Students must also wear\n\neither blue or khaki colored pants, shorts, skirts, or jumpers.\n\nThe shorts and skirts must be of appropriate size and length (no\n\nshorter than three inches above the knee).    The Policy prohibits\n\nthe wearing of, inter alia, denim, leather, suede, or vinyl, or\n\nany clothing that suggests gang affiliation, could conceal\n\ncontraband, or could create a distraction.    Certain other\n\nclothing items are also banned, such as open-heeled sandals,\n\nflip-flops, military boots, overalls, athletic pants, spandex,\n\nbaggy clothing, and sleeveless shirts.    The Uniform Policy also\n\nregulates the sizes of manufacturer logos permitted on clothing.\n\nPrior to the adoption of the Policy, Forney had a dress code that\n\nprohibited certain types of clothing deemed unsafe, immodest, or\n\notherwise inimical to the educational process.\n\n     Forney asserts that the Uniform Policy was adopted to\n\npromote school spirit and school values, and “to promote decorum\n\n(and thereby the notion that school is a place of order and\n\nwork), to promote respect for authority, to decrease\n\nsocioeconomic tensions, to increase attendance, and to reduce\n\ndrop out rates.”    Forney also asserts that it intended the Policy\n\n\n     3\n        There are slight differences between the mandatory\nuniform policies covering the primary and intermediate schools\nand the policy covering the secondary schools. These\ndifferences, however, are not relevant to the disposition of this\nappeal.\n\n                                  5\n\f“to increase student safety by reducing gang and drug related\n\nactivity as well as the likelihood of students bringing weapons\n\nto school undetected and by allowing teachers to more readily\n\ndistinguish Forney students from outsiders.”\n\n     Failure to comply with the Uniform Policy results in\n\ndisciplinary action, which could lead to expulsion.   As stated in\n\nthe Forney District-Wide Student Handbook, “if a non-exempt\n\nstudent attends school in violation of this uniform policy, the\n\nfollowing disciplinary steps will be taken in order: [1] the\n\nstudent will be placed immediately in isolation on the campus,\n\neither until the parent can bring appropriate clothing or for the\n\nentire day, whichever comes first; [2] the student will be sent\n\nto BAM [Behavioral Adjustment Modification] for a minimum of 3\n\ndays for the second infraction; [3] if the student still refuses\n\nto comply, the student will remain in BAM for a maximum of two\n\nweeks; [4] if the student still refuses to comply following the\n\ntwo week BAM assignment, the principal will pursue due process\n\nfor AEP [Alternative Education Program] or expulsion.”\n\n     In compliance with the requirement of Texas Education Code\n\n§ 11.162(c), the Uniform Policy includes an “opt-out” provision\n\nwhereby parents and students with “bona fide” religious or\n\nphilosophical objections to the wearing of a uniform can apply\n\nfor an exemption to the Policy.   The opt-out provision requires\n\nparents to request an Application for Exemption and fill out a\n\nquestionnaire designed to gauge the sincerity of the beliefs of\n\n                                  6\n\fthose parents who assert objections.   This questionnaire asks\n\nwhether the student has ever participated in any of a number of\n\nactivities that would have required him or her to wear a\n\nuniform.4   Families granted exemptions from the Uniform Policy\n\nmust reapply each school year.   A three-step grievance system was\n\ncreated to address issues arising from the opt-out procedure.5\n\n     The district court found that the parents of seventy-two\n\nstudents sought exemptions from compliance with the Uniform\n\nPolicy, of which twelve exemptions were granted.6   A few of the\n\nPlaintiffs-Appellants were within the group of students who were\n\ngranted exemptions from the Policy.    Most students who had based\n\ntheir objections on philosophical or religious grounds were\n\n\n\n\n     4\n        For example, the questionnaire asks if a student has\never worn a uniform to participate in activities such as girl\nscouts, boy scouts, non-school organized sports teams, school-\nsponsored sports teams, band, choir, drill team or whether a\nstudent has ever worn a uniform to work at a business, at church,\nor at a church-related activity. In addition, the questionnaire\nasks whether the parents have ever participated in activities\nthat might require a uniform.\n     5\n        Parents requesting an exemption from the Policy for\ntheir children are required to meet with a designated\nadministrator to discuss the Policy and the nature of the\nobjection. These “Level I” hearings are conducted by the campus\nprincipal or an assistant principal. Level I hearings may be\nappealed to a “Level II” hearing at the district level. Level II\nhearings are to be conducted by Defendant St. Clair or a deputy\nadministrator designated by him. A final “Level III” hearing is\navailable before the School Board Trustees.\n     6\n        Several of these opt-out exemptions were granted for\nmedical reasons.\n\n                                 7\n\fdenied exemptions because they had worn some type of uniform in\n\nthe past.\n\n     Several Plaintiffs-Appellants unsuccessfully sought\n\nexemption from the Uniform Policy through established\n\nadministrative channels.   Other Plaintiffs-Appellants refused to\n\nrespond to the questionnaire based on constitutional or personal\n\nobjections.   Plaintiffs-Appellants then brought suit under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and\n\ndamages.\n\n     Relevant to this appeal, Plaintiffs-Appellants bring three\n\nseparate, substantive constitutional challenges to the Uniform\n\nPolicy.    First, the student-Plaintiffs-Appellants subject to the\n\nUniform Policy assert that the compulsory wearing of uniforms\n\nviolates the First Amendment because the wearing of uniforms is\n\nboth a form of coerced speech, in that, it compels them to\n\nexpress ideas with which they may not agree, and, at the same\n\ntime, it is an infringement on free expression, in that it\n\nprevents them from freely expressing particular messages they do\n\nwish to convey.   Second, the parent-Plaintiffs-Appellants claim\n\nthat the compulsory Uniform Policy violates their “fundamental”\n\nright to control the upbringing and education of their children\n\nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.   Finally, four family-\n\nPlaintiffs-Appellants (parents seeking relief on behalf of their\n\nchildren), who sought exemption from the Uniform Policy on\n\nreligious grounds, allege that the existing opt-out procedures\n\n                                  8\n\frestrict their freedom to exercise their religious beliefs in\n\nviolation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment\n\nbecause the opt-out questionnaire and hearing procedures\n\nimpermissibly delve into the substance of their religious\n\nbeliefs.   Further, these four family-Plaintiffs-Appellants\n\ncontend that the opt-out procedures favor certain established\n\nreligions at the expense of other religions and thus violate the\n\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n     Defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) and moved for summary judgment based on\n\nqualified immunity.    The district court treated the motion to\n\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment and granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Defendants, concluding that no\n\nconstitutional violation occurred in this case.    The district\n\ncourt did not reach the qualified immunity issue.\n\n     Plaintiffs timely appeal the grant of summary judgment.\n\n                       II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant.   See Smith v. Brenoettsy, 158 F.3d 908, 911 (5th Cir.\n\n1998); see also Tolson v. Avondale Indus., Inc., 141 F.3d 604,\n\n608 (5th Cir. 1998).    “Summary judgment is proper ‘if the\n\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\n                                   9\n\fthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’”\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (quoting FED.\n\nR. CIV. P. 56(c)).   The moving party bears the burden of showing\n\nthe district court that there is an absence of evidence to\n\nsupport the nonmoving party’s case.    See id. at 325.   “If the\n\nmoving party fails to meet this initial burden, the motion must\n\nbe denied, regardless of the nonmovant’s response.    If the movant\n\ndoes, however, meet this burden, the nonmovant must go beyond the\n\npleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.”    Tubacex, Inc. v. M/V Risan, 45 F.3d\n\n951, 954 (5th Cir. 1995).    “A dispute over a material fact is\n\ngenuine ‘if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could\n\nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.’”    Smith, 158 F.3d at\n\n911 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248\n\n(1986)).    The substantive law determines which facts are\n\nmaterial.    See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.\n\n            III. FIRST AMENDMENT EXPRESSIVE CONDUCT CLAIMS\n\n     The First Amendment protects not only verbal and written\n\nexpression, but also symbols and conduct that constitute\n\n“symbolic speech.”    See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch.\n\nDist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-06 (1969).    As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained in Texas v. Johnson:\n\n     While we have rejected the view that an apparently limitless\n     variety of conduct can be labeled speech whenever the person\n     engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea,\n     we have acknowledged that conduct may be sufficiently imbued\n\n\n                                  10\n\f     with elements of communication to fall within the scope of\n     the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n491 U.S. 397, 404 (1989) (citations and internal quotations\n\nomitted).   In evaluating whether particular conduct possesses\n\n“sufficient communicative elements” to implicate First Amendment\n\nprotections, courts must ask whether “[a]n intent to convey a\n\nparticularized message was present, and . . . [whether] the\n\nlikelihood was great that the message would be understood by\n\nthose who viewed it.”    Id. (alterations in original) (quoting\n\nSpence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11 (1974)).\n\n     The protection of the First Amendment depends not only on\n\nwhether the conduct is expressive, but also on the context in\n\nwhich that expression takes place.    In the public school arena,\n\nthe free expression rights of students are balanced by the\n\ncorresponding interest of furthering the educational mission of\n\nschools.    Compare Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506 (recognizing that\n\nstudents do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of\n\nspeech or expression at the schoolhouse gate”), with Hazelwood\n\nSch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266 (1988) (“A school need\n\nnot tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic\n\neducational mission, even though the government could not censor\n\nsimilar speech outside the school.” (citations and internal\n\nquotations omitted)), and Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser,\n\n478 U.S. 675, 682 (1986) (recognizing that the First Amendment\n\nrights of public school students “are not automatically\n\n\n                                 11\n\fcoextensive with the rights of adults in other settings”).\n\nPublic schools, therefore, while responsible for inculcating the\n\nvalues of the First Amendment necessary for citizenship, are not\n\nthemselves unbounded forums for practicing those freedoms.\n\n     The student-Plaintiffs-Appellants (referred to in this\n\nsection as the “Students”) raise two separate free expression\n\narguments based on the First Amendment.7   The Students claim that\n\nthe Uniform Policy acts as a form of “coerced speech” in that it\n\nforces the Students to convey a state-approved message that\n\n\n\n     7\n        The district court found that the Plaintiffs-Appellants\nhad established the requisite Article III injury to challenge the\nUniform Policy. The district court stated:\n\n     [T]he Forney I.S.D. Student Uniform Policy specifically\n     provides that if a student persists in his refusal to comply\n     with the uniform policy, his ultimate sanction is the\n     alternative education program or expulsion. Thus, it is\n     apparent that the penalty of expulsion from school may be\n     imposed on those students who, for whatever reason, refuse\n     to wear the prescribed uniform. Moreover, Plaintiffs seek\n     remedies, including damages, for injuries which have already\n     occurred. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\n     have established a particularized, imminent or actual\n     injury, for purposes of Article III.\n\nSee Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 688. We agree. Students and\nparents may challenge unconstitutional actions in the public\nschools that directly affect the students. See e.g., Sch. Dist.\nof Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 224 (1963) (“The\nparties here are school children and their parents, who are\ndirectly affected by the laws and practices against which their\ncomplaints are directed. These interests surely suffice to give\nthe parties standing to complain.”). Of course, as will be\ndiscussed infra in the text, each subset of the Plaintiffs-\nAppellants (“Students,” “Parents,” and the four families with\nreligious objections) has standing only to challenge the\nparticular legal claim for which that subset can demonstrate\ninjury, causation, and redressability.\n\n                               12\n\fstudents do not wish to send,8 see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S.\n\n705, 714 (1977); West Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,\n\n633 (1943), and that the Uniform Policy acts as a “prior\n\nrestraint” by preventing the Students from freely expressing any\n\nmessage at all through their attire (other than the state-\n\napproved message).9   See United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367,\n\n376 (1968).\n\n     Defendants argue that the choice of student clothing is not\n\nexpressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, and thus,\n\nany rational regulation10 of such nonexpressive conduct should\n\n\n     8\n        Regarding the “coerced speech” argument, the Students\nargue that mandatory uniforms convey a particularized message\nthat the school district wishes to express, namely that students\nhave respect for the authority of teachers and administrators,\nhave Forney school and civic pride, and support the school\npolicies. The Students argue that this message is also\nunderstood by school officials, students, and the public, which\nis the exact reason why the Uniform Policy was adopted (or else\nit would have no rational purpose). The Students also adduced\nevidence from student depositions that these students did not\nwish to convey the message intended by Forney. Thus, the\nStudents conclude that mandatory uniforms coerce students to\nconvey a particular message, which Forney wishes them to express,\nbut which they oppose.\n     9\n        As to the “prior restraint” argument, the Students argue\nthat because the Uniform Policy precludes the use of clothing to\nexpress any message — no matter how specific or particularized —\nand that school children do wear clothing that sends political,\ncultural, and social messages, this restriction is a content-\nbased prior restraint on speech.\n     10\n        Defendants contend that this court should review the\nUniform Policy under rational-basis scrutiny. Under this\nstandard, courts look for a rational relationship between the\nregulation and a conceivable governmental interest. See FM Prop.\nOperating Co. v. City of Austin, 93 F.3d 167, 174-75 (5th Cir.\n1996).\n\n                                13\n\fsurvive constitutional scrutiny.      Defendants also contend that\n\nthe wearing of school uniforms does not convey a sufficiently\n\nparticularized message to be considered coerced speech, see\n\nSpence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409 (1974), and thus cannot\n\nbe considered a prior restraint on expression prohibited by the\n\nFirst Amendment.11   See Karr v. Schmidt, 460 F.2d 609, 613-14\n\n(5th Cir. 1972) (en banc).12\n\n     The threshold question, then, is whether the expression at\n\nissue is entitled to protection under the First Amendment.      The\n\ndistrict court agreed with Defendants and held that the mandatory\n\nUniform Policy did not implicate “expressive conduct” protected\n\nby the First Amendment.   See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 694\n\n(relying on Spence, 418 U.S. at 409, and Karr, 460 F.2d at 613-\n\n14, to find student clothing not to be protected expression under\n\nthe First Amendment).   However, subsequent to the district\n\ncourt’s issuance of its opinion, this court, in Canady v. Bossier\n\n\n     11\n        Defendants argue that the First Amendment only protects\nparticularized expression and that the only particularized\nmessage that the Students wish to convey by wearing non-uniform\nclothes is “individuality,” but that individuality, almost by\ndefinition, is not sufficiently particularized to be protected by\nthe First Amendment. Further, Defendants argue that there is no\nevidence that other people at school would be likely to\nunderstand the students’ message of “individuality.”\n     12\n        In Karr, this court rejected a constitutional challenge\nto a portion of a public school dress code that regulated the\nlength of hair for boys. See 460 F.2d at 613-14. The court\ndetermined that the decision to wear long hair is not expressive\nactivity protected by the First Amendment. See id. at 614 (“[W]e\nthink it inappropriate that the protection of the First Amendment\nbe extended to the wearing of long hair.”).\n\n                                 14\n\fParish School Board, explicitly addressed the First Amendment\n\nimplications of a mandatory school uniform policy and cast doubt\n\non the district court’s reasoning.     See 240 F.3d 437, 440 (5th\n\nCir. 2001) (disagreeing with the district court in Littlefield\n\nthat the rationale in Karr could be applied to students’ choice\n\nof attire).\n\n     In Canady, this court resolved a First Amendment challenge\n\nto a mandatory school uniform policy adopted by the Bossier\n\nParish School Board in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.    The Bossier\n\nuniform policy involved a similar requirement of one of several\n\ncolors of collared shirts and a similar choice between blue or\n\nkhaki pants.   In addressing the threshold question of expression,\n\nthis court assumed without deciding that “an individual’s choice\n\nof attire . . . may be endowed with sufficient levels of\n\nintentional expression to elicit First Amendment shelter.”     Id.\n\nFaced with an almost identical First Amendment challenge to a\n\nuniform policy, this court reasoned:\n\n     A person’s choice of clothing is infused with intentional\n     expression on many levels. In some instances, clothing\n     functions as pure speech. A student may choose to wear\n     shirts or jackets with written messages supporting political\n     candidates or important social issues. Words printed on\n     clothing qualify as pure speech and are protected under the\n     First Amendment. . . . Clothing may also symbolize ethnic\n     heritage, religious beliefs, and political and social views.\n     Individuals regularly use their clothing to express ideas\n     and opinions. . . . The choice to wear clothing as a symbol\n     of an opinion or cause is undoubtedly protected under the\n     First Amendment if the message is likely to be understood by\n     those intended to view it. . . . Finally, students in\n     particular often choose their attire with the intent to\n     signify the social group to which they belong, their\n\n                                15\n\f     participation in different activities, and their general\n     attitudes toward society and the school environment. While\n     the message students intend to communicate about their\n     identity and interests may be of little value to some\n     adults, it has a considerable [e]ffect, whether positive or\n     negative, on a young person’s social development.\n\nId. at 440-41 (citations omitted).     The Canady court then went on\n\nto state that while “this sort of expression may not convey a\n\nparticularized message to warrant First Amendment protection in\n\nevery instance, we cannot declare that expression of one’s\n\nidentity and affiliation to unique social groups through choice\n\nof clothing will never amount to protected speech.”     Id. at\n\n441.13    Assuming the First Amendment applies to the students’\n\nchoice of expression, the court then applied the First Amendment\n\nframework of United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968),\n\nrelating to content-neutral restrictions on expressive\n\nactivities, to hold that the Bossier Parish mandatory school\n\nuniform policy did not violate the First Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n          The court further qualified its conclusion:\n\n     We do not conclude that every choice of clothing expresses a\n     particularized message, and we make no judgment as to the\n     extent or type of clothing necessary to communicate a\n     discrete message in order to afford First Amendment\n     protection. Our analysis simply acknowledges that certain\n     choices of clothing may have sufficient communicative\n     content to qualify as First Amendment activity.\n\nCanady, 240 F.3d at 441 n.3.\n\n                                  16\n\f     For the purposes of this opinion, we follow the reasoning of\n\nthe Canady court14 and again, assume without deciding, that the\n\nFirst Amendment applies to the expressive conduct implicated in\n\nthe mandatory Uniform Policy.   However, applying the O’Brien\n\ntest, we hold that the Uniform Policy does not violate the First\n\nAmendment.\n\n     In O’Brien, the Supreme Court created an analytical\n\nframework to evaluate content-neutral restrictions on expressive\n\nactivities.   The Court held that “when ‘speech’ and ‘nonspeech’\n\nelements are combined in the same course of conduct, a\n\nsufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the\n\nnonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First\n\nAmendment freedoms.”   391 U.S. at 376.   Applying O’Brien to the\n\nchallenged governmental policy at issue, the Uniform Policy will\n\n\n     14\n        At issue in Canady was only a “prior restraint”-type\nargument. However, the assumption that student clothing, and\nthus the Uniform Policy, implicates expressive conduct also\napplies to the “coerced speech” challenge. In fact, as discussed\ninfra in the text, the requirement that all students wear a\ncertain type of uniform in order to further a certain\nparticularized message of the school district is arguably a\nstronger justification to find potential expressive conduct and,\nthus, to apply Canady and O’Brien. The Students have set forth\naffidavits from Forney officials that the Uniform Policy was\nintended to express a particular institutional image. In\ndeposition testimony, Forney school officials stated that the\npurpose of the uniform was, inter alia, to convey respect for\n“the values of the Forney schools” and the “City of Forney.”\nThus, because Forney implemented the Uniform Policy with the\nintention of conveying that message, we find it permissible to\nassume that the expression involved was intentional and\nparticularized and, thus, follow the logic of Canady in\nevaluating the coerced speech claim. As in Canady, however, we\nneed not and do not decide the issue.\n\n                                17\n\fsurvive constitutional scrutiny if (1) it is within the\n\nconstitutional power of the government, (2) it furthers an\n\nimportant or substantial governmental interest, (3) the interest\n\nis unrelated to the suppression of student expression, and (4)\n\nthe incidental restrictions on First Amendment activities are no\n\nmore than is necessary to facilitate that interest.         See id. at\n\n377.    The O’Brien standard is applicable to both the Students’\n\n“coerced speech” arguments, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705,\n\n716 (1977), and their “prior restraint”/”free expression”\n\narguments.      See Canady, 430 F.3d at 443.\n\n       We have little difficulty in concluding that the Uniform\n\nPolicy passes constitutional scrutiny under the O’Brien standard.\n\nFirst, there is no question that, pursuant to state law,\n\nDefendants have the power to pass a mandatory school uniform\n\npolicy.      See TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 11.162 (Vernon 1996).15\n\n       Second, improving the educational process is undoubtably an\n\nimportant and substantial interest of Forney and the school\n\nboard.      See Canady, 240 F.3d at 443; see also Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S.\n\nat 271-72.      The Uniform Policy was adopted to improve student\n\nperformance, instill self-confidence, foster self-esteem,\n\nincrease attendance, decrease disciplinary referrals, and lower\n\ndrop-out rates.      See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 686.     Such\n\ninterests in the health, safety, and order of public schools are\n\n\n       15\n        Plaintiffs-Appellants concede that § 11.162 of the Texas\nEducation Code is constitutional.\n\n                                     18\n\fsufficient government interests under O’Brien.    While the\n\nStudents argue that Defendants have failed to produce evidence of\n\nany need to further these improvements in Forney, we are\n\nsatisfied that, on this record, Defendants have established the\n\nrequisite connection between the Uniform Policy and the stated\n\ninterests in improving Forney schools.16    As has been well\n\nrecognized, federal courts should defer to school boards to\n\ndecide, within constitutional bounds, what constitutes\n\nappropriate behavior and dress in public schools.    See Canady,\n\n240 F.3d at 441, 444 (“[I]t is not the job of federal courts to\n\ndetermine the most effective way to educate our nation’s\n\nyouth.”); see also Fraser, 478 U.S. at 683.\n\n     Third, the Students have not established issues of material\n\nfact sufficient to demonstrate that the Defendants’ interest in\n\nenacting the Uniform Policy was to suppress expression.       See\n\nO’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377.   The record demonstrates that the\n\nUniform Policy was adopted for other legitimate reasons unrelated\n\nto the suppression of student expression.    For example, Forney\n\nasserts that the Policy was implemented to increase safety by\n\nproviding a means to differentiate Forney students from\n\n\n\n     16\n        The Forney School Board Policy included findings by the\nBoard that the requirement of wearing school uniforms would\nimprove the learning environment in the district. In addition,\nschool officials evaluated uniform policies in other school\ndistricts. This evaluation was made in an attempt to find\nsolutions to improve student performance and further the\ninterests discussed in the text.\n\n                                19\n\fnonstudents who might enter Forney campuses.    In addition, the\n\nUniform Policy was intended to decrease socioeconomic disparities\n\nand tensions between students, increase attendance (because\n\ntruants would be easily identified), and reduce gang and drug-\n\nrelated activity, as well as the likelihood of students bringing\n\nweapons to school undetected.17    Following Canady, we hold that\n\nForney’s purpose in enacting the Uniform Policy cannot be deemed\n\nan attempt to suppress or coerce speech.     Cf. Canady, 240 F.3d at\n\n443 (“The School Board’s purpose for enacting the uniform policy\n\nis to increase test scores and reduce disciplinary problems\n\nthroughout the school system.     This purpose is in no way related\n\nto the suppression of student speech.”).\n\n     Finally, we are satisfied that, because of the limited\n\nnature of the restriction, “the incidental restrictions on First\n\nAmendment activities are no more than is necessary to facilitate\n\n[Forney’s] interest.”   O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377.    The\n\nrestrictions pertain only to student attire during school hours\n\nand do not affect other means of communication.     Again, following\n\nCanady,\n\n     Although students are restricted from wearing clothing of\n     their choice at school, students remain free to wear what\n     they want after school hours. Students may still express\n\n\n     17\n        In fact, Forney has submitted evidence that three out of\nthe four campuses had an increase in attendance and a decline in\nnon-dress code disciplinary referrals. Further, in three\ninstances, four nonstudents on campus were intercepted and asked\nto leave the school grounds, in part, because they were\nidentifiable as non-Forney students.\n\n                                  20\n\f     their views through other mediums during the school day.\n     The uniform requirement does not bar the important “personal\n     intercommunication among students” necessary to an effective\n     educational process.\n\nId. at 443 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 512).     Thus, we hold that\n\nthe Uniform Policy survives First Amendment scrutiny under the\n\nO’Brien test and, because there are no genuine issues of material\n\nfact regarding the application of the O’Brien test, we affirm the\n\njudgment of the district court.\n\n        IV. PARENTAL RIGHTS UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT\n\n     The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits States from depriving\n\npersons “of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\n\nlaw.”   See U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.   As the Supreme Court\n\nrecently reaffirmed: “We have long recognized that the\n\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause, like its Fifth Amendment\n\ncounterpart, ‘guarantees more than fair process.’    The Clause\n\nalso includes a substantive component that ‘provides heightened\n\nprotection against government interference with certain\n\nfundamental rights and liberty interests.’”     Troxel v. Granville,\n\n530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) (quoting Washington v.\n\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719, 720 (1997)).\n\n     One of “the fundamental liberty interests” recognized by the\n\nCourt is the “interest of parents in the care, custody, and\n\ncontrol of their children.”   See id., at 65-66 (“[I]t cannot now\n\nbe doubted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make\n\n\n                                  21\n\fdecisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their\n\nchildren.”); see also Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923)\n\n(recognizing that the liberty interest protected by due process\n\nincludes the right of parents “to control the education of their\n\nown”); Pierce v. Soc’y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-35 (1925)\n\n(recognizing that “the liberty of parents and guardians” includes\n\nthe right “to direct the upbringing and education of children\n\nunder their control”); Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166\n\n(1944) (recognizing that there is a constitutional interest in\n\nparents directing the “custody, care and nurture of the child”).\n\n     The parent-Plaintiffs-Appellants (referred to in this\n\nsection as the “Parents”) argue that their right to control their\n\nchildren’s education is a fundamental right entitled to\n\nheightened constitutional protection.   Specifically, the Parents\n\nclaim that the mandatory school uniforms interfere with their\n\nparental rights to teach their children to be guided by one’s own\n\nconscience in making decisions, to understand the importance of\n\nappropriate grooming and attire, to understand the importance of\n\none’s own individuality, and to respect the individuality of\n\nothers.   The Parents argue that the implementation of mandatory\n\nuniforms presumes that parents are either incapable or unwilling\n\nto act in the best interests of their children.   Because the\n\nParents assert that this right of “control” has been recognized\n\nas “fundamental,” see Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65, the Parents contend\n\n\n\n                                22\n\fthat a “strict-scrutiny”18 level of analysis must be applied to\n\nthe Uniform Policy.\n\n     Defendants argue, in contrast, that while parents may have a\n\nfundamental liberty interest in their children’s upbringing, this\n\ninterest cannot usurp the state’s role in determining appropriate\n\nbehavior at public schools, including the role of determining\n\nappropriate dress codes in the district.    Defendants argue that\n\nnotwithstanding the Supreme Court’s recent reaffirmation of\n\nparental rights as fundamental rights in Troxel, that decision\n\ndoes not in any way extend parents’ rights to frustrate basic\n\nschool rules reasonably required to regulate the educational\n\nsystem.   Defendants argue, therefore, that a rational-\n\nrelationship/rational-basis19 test is the appropriate standard to\n\njudge the school Uniform Policy at issue.\n\n     The district court agreed with Defendants and applied a\n\nrational-basis test, concluding that Forney’s Uniform Policy did\n\nnot infringe the Parents’ fundamental right to control the\n\n\n\n     18\n        The Due Process Clause provides “heightened protection\nagainst government interference with certain fundamental rights\nand liberty interests.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702,\n720 (1997). Government actions that burden the exercise of those\nfundamental rights or liberty interests are subject to strict\nscrutiny and will be upheld only when they are narrowly tailored\nto a compelling governmental interest. See Reno v. Flores, 507\nU.S. 292, 302 (1993) (reaffirming that due process “forbids the\ngovernment to infringe certain ‘fundamental’ liberty interests at\nall, . . . unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve\na compelling state interest”).\n     19\n          See supra note 10.\n\n                                23\n\frearing and education of their children.    See Littlefield, 108 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 703.   The district court rejected the Parents’\n\nargument that the Supreme Court’s determination in Troxel — that\n\nthe Due Process Clause protects the fundamental right of parents\n\nto make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of\n\ntheir children — could be read to cover complaints about a school\n\nUniform Policy.    See id. at 702 (“The fundamental right of\n\nfiliation and companionship with one’s children, which the\n\nSupreme Court examined in Troxel, is an entirely different\n\nbalance of interests from the right of parents to send their\n\nchildren to a public school in clothes of their own choosing.”).\n\nWe agree with the impressively reasoned decision of the district\n\ncourt on this issue.\n\n      In Troxel, the Court struck down a Washington State statute\n\nthat allowed “any person,” including a grandparent, to petition\n\nfor visitation rights at any time, if it was in the best\n\ninterests of the child.    See 530 U.S. at 63.   The Court found the\n\nstatute offensive to the parental rights of the mother in that it\n\nunconstitutionally interfered with the mother’s right to make\n\ndecisions concerning the upbringing of her child.     See id. at 69-\n\n70.   While the Supreme Court in Troxel recognized that there\n\nexists a fundamental right of parents to direct their children’s\n\nupbringing, it failed to articulate a standard of judicial\n\n\n\n\n                                 24\n\fscrutiny to be applied.20   See id. at 80 (Thomas, J., concurring)\n\n(“The opinions of the plurality, Justice Kennedy, and Justice\n\nSouter recognize such a right, but curiously none of them\n\narticulates the appropriate standard of review.”)).\n\n     The dispositive question at issue is whether the sweeping\n\nstatements of the plurality opinion in Troxel regarding the\n\n“fundamental” “interest of parents in the care, custody, and\n\ncontrol of their children,” see id. at 65, mandate a strict\n\nstandard of scrutiny for the Parents’ Fourteenth Amendment\n\nchallenge to the Uniform Policy.      We do not read Troxel to create\n\na fundamental right for parents to control the clothing their\n\nchildren wear to public schools and, thus, instead follow almost\n\neighty years of precedent analyzing parental rights in the\n\ncontext of public education under a rational-basis standard.\n\n     Before the Supreme Court’s Troxel opinion, the Court had\n\naddressed the issue of parental rights in public schools in three\n\nmajor opinions.   First, in Meyer v. Nebraska, the Court held\n\nunconstitutional a law that forbade schools from teaching foreign\n\n\n\n     20\n        The Court also failed to reach agreement on the\nparameters of the right at issue. See Troxel, 530 U.S. at 78\n(Souter, J., concurring) (“Our cases . . . have not set out exact\nmetes and bounds to the protected interest of a parent in the\nrelationship with his child.”); see id. at 95 (Kennedy, J.,\ndissenting) (“The principle [that the Fourteenth Amendment\nprotects parental rights] exists, then, in broad formulation; yet\ncourts must use considerable restraint, including careful\nadherence to the incremental instruction given by the precise\nfacts of particular cases, as they seek to give further and more\nprecise definition to the right.”).\n\n                                 25\n\flanguages to students below the eighth grade, applying the\n\nequivalent of a rational-basis review.21   See 262 U.S. 390, 396-\n\n97, 403 (1923) (“We are constrained to conclude that the statute\n\nas applied is arbitrary, and without reasonable relation to any\n\nend within the competency of the state.” (emphasis added)).   The\n\nSupreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the\n\nright “to marry, establish a home, and bring up children.”    Id.\n\nat 399.\n\n     Two years later, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Court\n\nstruck down a state law prohibiting parents from sending their\n\nchildren to private school, again utilizing the equivalent of a\n\nrational-basis test.   See 268 U.S. 510, 530-31 (1925).   The Court\n\ninvalidated the statute because it “unreasonably interfer[ed]\n\nwith the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the\n\nupbringing and education of children under their control.”    Id.\n\nat 534-35 (emphasis added).\n\n     Finally, in Wisconsin v. Yoder, members of the Old Order\n\nAmish religion and the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church argued\n\nthat mandatory school attendance beyond the eighth grade violated\n\ntheir rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the First\n\nAmendment’s Free Exercise Clause.    See 406 U.S. 205, 207 (1972).\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed that, as it applied to the Amish, the\n\n\n\n     21\n        We use the term “equivalent” because both Meyer and\nPierce were decided before the Supreme Court adopted its tiered-\nscrutiny method of analysis.\n\n                                26\n\fstate law was unconstitutional.    See id. at 234.   Yoder was\n\ndecided based on the Free Exercise Clause, but it informs the\n\ndiscussion about the balancing of interests regarding parental\n\nrights implicated under the Fourteenth Amendment.    The Court\n\nacknowledged both the state interest in providing and regulating\n\na state public education system and the parental interest in\n\ncontrolling a child’s religious upbringing and education.        See\n\nid. at 213-14.   As the district court in this case reasoned:\n\n     Understanding the full import of Yoder, which refined the\n     parental rights announced in Meyer and Pierce, is critical\n     to properly analyze the claims presented in the present\n     case. In Yoder, the Supreme Court, while reaffirming the\n     general notion that parental rights are a protected liberty\n     interest under the due process clause, recognized the “high\n     responsibility” and regulatory power of the state in matters\n     of public education. Furthermore, while fundamental\n     religious practices may excuse parents from complying with\n     educational policies, secular objections to such policies\n     are insufficient to avoid compliance.\n\nLittlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 699 (emphasis added).    The Yoder\n\nCourt went on to state that “[a] way of life, however virtuous\n\nand admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable\n\nstate regulation of education if it is based on purely secular\n\nconsiderations.”   Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215 (emphasis added).22\n\n\n     22\n        In striking down the statute as applied to the Amish,\nthe Supreme Court applied a stricter standard than rational basis\nreview because the parental interests were combined with free\nexercise interests. See Yoder, 406 U.S. at 233 (“[W]hen the\ninterests of parenthood are combined with a free exercise claim\nof the nature revealed by this record, more than merely a\nreasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the\nState is required to sustain the validity of the State’s\nrequirement under the First Amendment.” (citations and internal\nquotations omitted)).\n\n                                  27\n\f       Thus, as the district court recognized: “[w]hile the Court\n\nemployed more than a rational basis standard with reference to\n\nthe First Amendment free exercise clause, it is clear that the\n\ndue process interest of parents to direct the upbringing and\n\neducation of their children, standing alone, warranted no more\n\nthan rational-basis review.”    Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n699.    As such, the district court concluded that Meyer, Pierce,\n\nand Yoder, taken together, support the argument that a rational-\n\nbasis review is the appropriate standard in this case.   This\n\nconclusion is in accord with other circuit courts of appeals that\n\nhave addressed the issue, pre-Troxel.    See Herndon v. Chapel Hill\n\n— Carrboro City Bd. of Educ., 89 F.3d 174, 177-79 (4th Cir.\n\n1996); Immediato v. Rye Neck Sch. Dist., 73 F.3d 454, 461 (2d\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n       Troxel does not change the above reasoning in the context of\n\nparental rights concerning public education.    While Parents may\n\nhave a fundamental right in the upbringing and education of their\n\nchildren, this right does not cover the Parents’ objection to a\n\npublic school Uniform Policy.    It has long been recognized that\n\nparental rights are not absolute in the public school context and\n\ncan be subject to reasonable regulation.    See, e.g., Runyon v.\n\nMcCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 177 (1976) (recognizing no parental right\n\nto educate children in private segregated academies); Kite v.\n\nMarshall, 661 F.2d 1027, 1029 (5th Cir. 1981); see also Swanson\n\nv. Guthrie Indep. Sch. Dist., 135 F.3d 694, 698 (10th Cir. 1998)\n\n                                 28\n\f(recognizing that cases in this area establish that “parents\n\nsimply do not have a constitutional right to control each and\n\nevery aspect of their children’s education and oust the state’s\n\nauthority over that subject”); Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods.,\n\nInc., 68 F.3d 525, 533 (1st Cir. 1995); Fleischfresser v. Dir. of\n\nSch. Dist. 200, 15 F.3d 680, 690 (7th Cir. 1994); Murphy v.\n\nArkansas, 852 F.2d 1039, 1044 (8th Cir. 1988); Fellowship Baptist\n\nChurch v. Benton, 815 F.2d 485, 491 (8th Cir. 1987).   These cases\n\nsupport the determinations in Meyer, Pierce, and Yoder that a\n\nrational-basis test is the appropriate level of scrutiny for\n\nparental rights in the public school context.\n\n     Applying the rational-basis test, we conclude that the\n\nUniform Policy is rationally related to the state’s interest in\n\nfostering the education of its children and furthering the\n\nlegitimate goals of improving student safety, decreasing\n\nsocioeconomic tensions, increasing attendance, and reducing drop-\n\nout rates.   Therefore, we affirm the district court’s summary\n\njudgment determination that the Uniform Policy does not violate\n\nthe Parents’ Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n     V. FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE AND ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE CLAIMS\n\n     We find no merit in the family-Plaintiffs-Appellants’\n\n(referred to in this section as the “Families”) claims under the\n\nFree Exercise and the Establishment Clauses of the First\n\n\n\n\n                                29\n\fAmendment.23   On appeal, the Families do not challenge the\n\nconstitutionality of Texas Education Code § 11.162(c),24 focusing\n\ninstead on the application of the “opt-out” procedures by the\n\nDefendants (hereinafter referred to as the “opt-out policy”).\n\nThe district court properly dismissed these First Amendment\n\nchallenges in its well-reasoned opinion.   See Littlefield, 108 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 703-08.   We agree with the district court that the\n\nForney opt-out policy neither infringes on the families’ free\n\nexercise of religion nor violates the Establishment Clause.\n\n                      A. Free Exercise Claim25\n\n\n     23\n        Only four families (parents and children) have Article\nIII standing to bring the Free Exercise and Establishment Clause\nclaims, see supra note 7, because only these four families sought\nexemption from the Uniform Policy on religious grounds. These\nfamilies are: Virginia McLaren and her daughter Natalie Johnson\n(the “McLaren/Johnson” family), Mary Penn and her children Lynzi\nand Drew Anderson (the “Penn/Anderson” family), William and Norma\nTapley and their daughter Kaytie Tapley (the “Tapleys”), and\nDavid and Vinita Lowery and their daughter Madeline Lowery (the\n“Lowerys”) (collectively the “Families”). As the standing\nanalysis for the Free Exercise Claim and the Establishment Clause\nClaim differ, we address the standing inquiry for each claim at\nthe outset of each analytical section. See infra notes 25 & 31.\n     24\n          See supra note 2.\n     25\n        To have Article III standing to pursue an alleged\nviolation of the Free Exercise Clause, a plaintiff must allege\nthat his or her own “particular religious freedoms are\ninfringed.” Sch. Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 204, 224\nn.9 (1963); Altman v. Bedford Cent. Sch. Dist., 245 F.3d 49, 71\n(2d Cir. 2001); see also Fleischfresser, 15 F.3d at 684\n(recognizing standing because “[o]ne aspect of the religious\nfreedom of parents is the right to control the religious\nupbringing and training of their minor children”). Each family\nhas alleged that the opt-out policy, by requiring them to\nexplain, defend, and conform their religious practices in an\neffort not to have their children disciplined or expelled from\n\n                                 30\n\f     The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has\n\nbeen made applicable to the states by incorporation into the\n\nFourteenth Amendment26 provides that “Congress shall make no law\n\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free\n\nexercise thereof.”   U.S. CONST. amend. I.   In Employment Division,\n\nDepartment of Human Resources v. Smith, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat a neutral, generally applicable governmental regulation will\n\nwithstand a free exercise challenge when the regulation is\n\nreasonably related to a legitimate state interest.     See 494 U.S.\n\n872, 879 (1990); Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of\n\nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (“In addressing the\n\nconstitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our\n\ncases establish the general proposition that a law that is\n\nneutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a\n\ncompelling governmental interest even if the law has the\n\nincidental effect of burdening a particular religious\n\npractice.”).\n\n\n\nschool, thereby infringes on their right to freely exercise their\nreligious beliefs. Due to the opt-out policy, the\nMcLaren/Johnson family removed Natalie from the Forney school\ndistrict, rather than be subject to what they allege was a\nviolation of their First Amendment rights. The Penn/Anderson\nfamily and the Tapleys refused to participate in the opt-out\nquestionnaire, claiming that the procedures themselves were\nviolative of their religious freedom. The Lowerys were granted a\nreligious exemption, but because the policy requires them to re-\napply every year, they claim that the policy threatens a future\ninjury.\n     26\n          See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940).\n\n                                 31\n\f     On its face, the opt-out policy enacted by Forney is neutral\n\nand of general application, in that it applies to all persons who\n\nmight wish to attend Forney and choose to opt-out of the Uniform\n\nPolicy.   All parties also agree that the opt-out policy was not\n\nenacted to inhibit religion and, in fact, recognize that the\n\nstatutory provision was enacted to protect the reasonable state\n\ninterest of fostering the free exercise of religion.   As a\n\nthreshold matter, then, the opt-out policy survives\n\nconstitutional scrutiny under Smith.\n\n     The Families’ specific complaint, however, is that in the\n\nprocess of legitimately inquiring about the religious beliefs of\n\nfamilies seeking exemption from the Uniform Policy, Defendants\n\nhave “crossed the line between the legitimate inquiry into the\n\nsincerity of Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs and prohibited inquiry\n\ninto the substance of those beliefs.”   The Families argue that,\n\nbecause there was no established school policy for determining\n\nwho would be granted an exception, Defendants have become\n\narbiters of the substance of religions in a manner that infringes\n\nthe Families’ free exercise of their beliefs.27\n\n\n     27\n        The Families have abandoned allegations of a “hybrid-\nrights” challenge to the opt-out policy. The “hybrid-rights”\nargument is based on the Supreme Court’s language in Smith, which\nrecognized that a heightened standard of review may be required\nwhen a Free Exercise Clause claim is combined with another\nconstitutional protection such as free expression or parental\nrights. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 881 (“The only decisions in which\nwe have held that the First Amendment bars application of a\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action\nhave involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free\n\n                                32\n\f     The difficulty for the Families is twofold.      First, the\n\nFamilies concede that it is permissible for Forney to examine the\n\n“sincerity” of their beliefs.   Second, on this record there\n\nexists an established district policy that Defendants have\n\nfollowed in a consistent manner.      We address these issues\n\ntogether.\n\n     Section 11.162(c) of the Texas Education Code provides that\n\nparents may exempt their children from the Uniform Policy if they\n\ncan provide a bona fide religious or philosophical objection to\n\nthe wearing of the uniform.28   In an effort to provide an\n\nobjective means of determining the sincerity of the “bona fides”\n\nof a religious belief, Forney established a process of requiring\n\nwritten objection, the completion of a questionnaire that\n\nrequests information regarding whether students had worn uniforms\n\nin the past, and personal meetings with the parents.29     This\n\nprocess to determine the sincerity of a religious objection,\n\nwhile fraught with difficulty, is necessary to separate sincere\n\n\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional\nprotections.”). The district court rejected the argument.         We do\nnot address it.\n     28\n          See supra note 2.\n     29\n        Contrary to the Families’ claims, the Forney opt-out\npolicy was not solely dependant on parents’ responses to the\nquestionnaire. For example, the Lowerys initially refused to\nfill out the questionnaire. On appeal to the Board of Trustees,\nhowever, the Lowerys were granted an exemption based on their\nstated belief that their Native American ancestry combined with\ntheir Catholic beliefs deriving from their interpretation of the\n“Vatican II” proscribed the wearing of uniforms.\n\n                                 33\n\fbeliefs from fraudulent beliefs.     See Patrick v. LeFevre, 745\n\nF.2d 153, 157 (2d Cir. 1984) (“Sincerity analysis seeks to\n\ndetermine an adherent’s good faith in the expression of his\n\nreligious belief.   This test provides a rational means of\n\ndifferentiating between those beliefs that are held as a matter\n\nof conscience and those that are animated by motives of deception\n\nand fraud.” (citations omitted)); see also Hernandez v.\n\nCommissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 696-97 (1989); United States v. Daly,\n\n756 F.2d 1076, 1081 (5th Cir. 1985) (“Although courts may not\n\ndetermine whether a given belief is or is not a religion, the\n\ntrier of fact may determine whether a belief is truly held\n\nwithout violating the First Amendment.” (citations omitted)).\n\n     Because the opt-out procedures are a neutral and rational\n\nmeans to determine sincerity, as a legal matter under Smith, they\n\ndo not interfere with the free exercise of religion.     See 494\n\nU.S. at 877.   Further, in practice, “opt-outs” have been granted\n\nto parents who have demonstrated a sincere and consistent\n\nobjection to the wearing of uniforms.30    Therefore, we conclude\n\n\n     30\n        For example, Mr. and Mrs. J.M. stated in response to an\nopt-out request for Judy M., a Forney student, that Mr. M.’s\n“negative personal experience” with uniforms in Catholic school\ncreated a sincere belief that Judy M. should not wear a uniform.\nFurther, they answered “no” to all relevant questions regarding\ntheir child’s previous wearing of uniforms. The exemption was\ngranted for Judy M. In similar fashion, Mr. O., father of a\nForney student Patrick O., indicated that he had pulled his\nchildren out of Catholic school, partly because of his objections\nto uniforms. Mr. O. also responded to the questionnaire with\n“no” to each item. Again, the exemption was granted. In\naddition, the Lowerys were granted an exemption based on their\n\n                                34\n\fthat the Families have not created a genuine issue of material\n\nfact that the application of Forney’s opt-out policy violates\n\ntheir free exercise rights under the First Amendment.\n\n                  B. Establishment Clause Claim31\n\n     The Families’ Establishment Clause argument is equally\n\nwithout merit.   The Families assert that Defendants will grant\n\nexemption requests only upon proof that the applicant strictly\n\nadhered to an organized religion, thus manifesting a preference\n\nfor only those religions in which adherents could provide written\n\n\n\n\nreligious beliefs that combine their Native American ancestry and\ntheir Catholic beliefs based on an interpretation of Vatican II.\n     31\n        “[T]he concept of injury for standing purposes is\nparticularly elusive in Establishment Clause cases.” Murray v.\nCity of Austin, 947 F.2d 147, 151 (5th Cir. 1991). As the Court\nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recognized:\n\n     [T]he standing inquiry in Establishment Clause cases has\n     been tailored to reflect the kind of injuries Establishment\n     Clause plaintiffs are likely to suffer. . . . [T]he\n     spiritual, value-laden beliefs of the plaintiffs are often\n     most directly affected by an alleged establishment of\n     religion. Accordingly, rules of standing recognize that\n     noneconomic or intangible injury may suffice to make an\n     Establishment Clause claim justiciable.\n\nSuhre v. Haywood County, 131 F.3d 1083, 1086 (4th Cir. 1997)\n(citations omitted); see also Altman, 245 F.3d at 72 (“[S]tanding\nto assert an Establishment Clause claim may rest . . . on the\nplaintiff’s direct exposure to the challenged activity.”);\nMurray, 947 F.2d at 151-52. In the instant case, the Families\nhave alleged that the application of the opt-out policy appears\nto favor certain organized religions to which the Families do not\nbelong. This direct exposure to the policy satisfies the\n“intangible injury” requirement to bring an Establishment Clause\nchallenge.\n\n                                35\n\fproof of the tenets of their beliefs.32   The Families argue that,\n\nin granting exemptions only to religions for which a prohibition\n\non uniforms was clearly stated in the tenets of that religion,\n\nDefendants were establishing some religions as favored over\n\nothers, in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n\n     To withstand an Establishment Clause challenge, a statute\n\nmust have a secular legislative purpose, the statute’s primary\n\npurpose must neither advance nor inhibit religion, and the\n\nstatute must not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.\n\nSee Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971).      As the\n\ndistrict court found:\n\n     [T]he uniform policy unquestionably has a secular purpose.\n     Next, the principal effect neither advances nor inhibits\n     religion. Its purpose is to enhance the learning\n     environment in the Forney schools, irrespective of the\n     religious faith of a particular student. Finally, the\n     policy does not unnecessarily entangle the School Board with\n     religion. The uniform policy references religion only in\n     the context of exemptions. There is no evidence to suggest\n     that as a result of the uniform policy, the School Board\n     must routinely or even occasionally become involved in\n     religious matters. Less than one hundred exemption\n     requests, out of nearly 2,500 students, were considered by\n     the School Board, and the vast majority concerned secular\n     opt-out requests.\n\nLittlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 708.   We agree with the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion.   None of the families raising the\n\nEstablishment Clause challenge can point to any religious purpose\n\nbehind the implementation of the opt-out policy.    Nor can these\n\n\n     32\n        The Families posit the Amish and followers of Islam as\nexamples of religious believers who could point to written tenets\nto support their opt-out claims.\n\n                                36\n\ffamilies point to any “primary effect” of the opt-out policy that\n\nadvances a particular religion or that inhibits a religion.    On\n\nthis record, it appears that those families that could\n\ndemonstrate sincere and consistent rejection of mandatory\n\nuniforms were granted exemptions regardless of the particular\n\ntenets of their faith.33   Finally, we do not perceive an\n\nintolerable risk of excessive government entanglement in the\n\nrequirement that parents demonstrate their consistency and\n\nsincerity by explaining the basis of their religious objections\n\nto Defendants.   We therefore affirm the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment on these claims.\n\n                           VI. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court in favor of Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n     33\n          See supra note 30.\n\n                                 37\n\fRHESA HAWKINS BARKSDALE, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\n\n     I concur in the result and in all but part III.       (“First\n\nAmendment Expressive Conduct Claims”) of the majority opinion.\n\n                                I.\n\n     Concerning part III., our court utilizes assumptions regarding\n\nthe claims of coerced-speech and restraint on free expression,\n\nrather than directly addressing those claims.     By doing so, we\n\nsimply invite, if not encourage, needless, repetitive litigation.\n\n                               II.\n\n     The wearing of the uniform at issue is not “expression” for\n\nFirst Amendment purposes. Accordingly, there is no coerced speech.\n\nLikewise, for the restraint-on-free-expression claim, and on this\n\nrecord, the requisite expression has not been demonstrated.\n\n                                A.\n\n     I regret we have not confronted the issue our court avoided in\n\nCanady v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 240 F.3d 437 (5th Cir. 2001):\n\nwhether the wearing of a school uniform devoid of any logo, symbol,\n\nor motto is “expression” for First Amendment purposes.   The answer\n\nto that question would resolve directly the coerced-speech claim at\n\nissue.   Obviously, if that which is coerced is not speech, then\n\nspeech has not been coerced.\n\n                                1.\n\n     The majority correctly acknowledges, as did our court in\n\nCanady, that the two-part test from Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S.\n\n405, 410-11 (1974), is the correct analysis for discerning whether\n\fconduct — such as the wearing of a school uniform — is sufficiently\n\nexpressive to merit First Amendment protection.             Canady explains\n\nthe application of that test:\n\n          “In   deciding  whether   particular   conduct\n          possesses sufficient communicative elements to\n          bring the First Amendment into play, we [must]\n          ask[] whether ‘[a]n intent to convey a\n          particularized   message   was  present,   and\n          [whether] the likelihood was great that the\n          message would be understood by those who\n          viewed it.’” When assessing the appellants’\n          claim, we look to the particular activity,\n          combined   with   the  factual   context   and\n          environment in which it was undertaken.\n\n240 F.3d at 440 (quoting Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404\n\n(1989))(alteration in original)(citations omitted). Unfortunately,\n\nthe majority, as did the Canady court, fails to adequately apply\n\nSpence to determine whether a school uniform specifically, as\n\nopposed to clothing generally, can constitute expression. Instead,\n\nas was done in Canady, the majority assumes for purposes of this\n\nappeal that   the   wearing   of   the   uniform   at    issue   constitutes\n\nexpressive conduct.\n\n     Appellants (collectively, Students) assert that, for cases of\n\ncoerced speech, the two-part Spence test was abrogated by Hurley v.\n\nIrish-Am. Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557\n\n(1995)   (holding     Massachusetts       public        accommodation   law\n\nunconstitutional as applied to require private organizers of St.\n\nPatrick’s Day parade to include gay, lesbian, and bisexual group as\n\nits own parade unit).   They rely on the Court’s statement that “a\n\n\n                                    39\n\fnarrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of\n\nconstitutional     protection,    which   if   confined    to     expressions\n\nconveying   a   ‘particularized    message,’    would     never    reach   the\n\nunquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock, music of\n\nArnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll”.             Id. at\n\n569 (citation omitted).\n\n     Of course, where speech is pure, a particularized message has\n\nnever been required; pure speech is entitled to “comprehensive\n\nprotection under the First Amendment”. Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\n\nCom. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-06 (1969).        The Spence test, on\n\nthe other hand, was established to address speech that is less than\n\npure:   namely, “expression of an idea through activity”.            Spence,\n\n418 U.S. at 411.\n\n     That wearing a school uniform is not pure speech is supported\n\nby Tinker, which involved students being suspended for wearing\n\nblack armbands to school to protest the conflict in Vietnam.               In\n\ndistinguishing the armband-suspension from other clothing-related\n\nregulations, the Court explained:          “The problem posed by the\n\npresent case does not relate to regulation of the length of skirts\n\nor the type of clothing, to hair style, or deportment....                  Our\n\nproblem involves direct, primary First Amendment rights akin to\n\n‘pure speech’”.     Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507-08.           Accordingly, for\n\ndetermining what — if any — expressive content there is in wearing\n\n\n\n\n                                    40\n\fthe school uniform at issue, we must follow Canady’s instruction\n\nand engage in the two-part Spence analysis.\n\n     While the Students have proffered some evidence that the\n\nForney Independent School District (FISD) intended to convey a\n\nmessage in adopting the uniform policy — namely, pride in and\n\nrespect for the values of FISD and its schools — I question whether\n\nsuch a message is sufficiently particularized as to satisfy Spence.\n\nBut, even if FISD did intend that message, I doubt there is any\n\nlikelihood whatsoever, no less the “great likelihood” required by\n\nSpence, that such a message would be understood by anyone who\n\nhappens to see students’ blue or khaki trousers (or skirt) and\n\nsolid-colored   shirt.    When   worn    in   the   factual   context   and\n\nenvironment in which students are required to wear the uniform —\n\nthat is, school — the uniform conveys at most the following\n\nmessage:    that the wearer is a student.\n\n     Accordingly I would hold that, as a matter of law, the wearing\n\nof a school uniform devoid of any logo, symbol, or motto — like the\n\nwearing of long hair that was at issue in this court’s en banc\n\ndecision in Karr v. Schmidt, 460 F.2d 609 (5th Cir. 1972)(en banc),\n\ncert. denied, 409 U.S. 989 (1972) — does not involve “sufficient\n\ncommunicative content” to qualify as expression for First Amendment\n\npurposes.    Consequently, the requirement to wear such a uniform\n\ncannot constitute coerced speech.       As the Supreme Court implied in\n\nHurley, where the disfavored message is “difficult to identify”,\n\n\n                                  41\n\fthere is no risk that the allegedly coerced party is forced “to\n\npropound a particular point of view”.   Hurley, 515 U.S. at 574-75.\n\n                                2.\n\n     Of course, deciding that the wearing of such a school uniform\n\nis not expressive conduct alleviates the need to examine the\n\ncoercion claim under the four-part O’Brien test regarding content-\n\nneutral restrictions on expressive conduct.   See United States v.\n\nO’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968).      Indeed, I question whether\n\nO’Brien applies to school uniform cases.        See, e.g., Phoenix\n\nElementary Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Green, 943 P.2d 836 (Ariz. Ct. App.\n\n1997) (school uniform policy is a content-neutral regulation of the\n\nmedium, not the message; accordingly, nonpublic forum analysis is\n\nthe appropriate test); see also Canady, 240 F.3d at 443 (noting the\n\nsimilarity of O’Brien to traditional time, place, manner analysis).\n\nBut that question is best left for another day.    Because coercion\n\nto wear the uniform at issue is not coercion to speak, there is no\n\nneed to apply any degree of heightened scrutiny.\n\n                                B.\n\n     My conclusion that the wearing of the school uniform at issue\n\nis not expressive does not, of course, dictate a result with regard\n\nto the Students’ other First Amendment claim:     restraint on free\n\nexpression.   For even if the uniform is not imbued with expressive\n\nvalue, the uniform policy still precludes the Students from wearing\n\nclothing of their choice that may be expressive.\n\n\n                                42\n\f      In addressing this second claim, the majority again follows\n\nthe lead of the Canady court in assuming that the uniform policy\n\nimplicates expressive clothing choices.        Accordingly, the majority\n\nproceeds with the O’Brien analysis.\n\n      Although “certain choices of clothing may have sufficient\n\ncommunicative content to qualify as First Amendment activity”,\n\nCanady, 240 F.3d at 441 n.3, the present record contains only vague\n\ndepictions of messages the Students supposedly intend to convey\n\nthrough clothing choice.         The deposition testimony of one Student\n\nis typical:\n\n              I mean, I don’t like them [school uniforms].\n              I don’t like that we have to wear the same\n              thing every day. It’s a routine that I don’t\n              like to be in. I don’t like to be told what\n              to wear. I would rather wear something that\n              expresses who I am.\n\n      Arguably, the various “messages” proffered by Students in\n\ntheir depositions may be loosely grouped around the concept of\n\nindividuality.     But, I cannot agree — nor will I assume — that such\n\na   message    satisfies   the   two-part   Spence    test   for   discerning\n\nexpressive conduct. Because the Students have failed to articulate\n\na particularized message likely to be understood by anyone, I would\n\nnot examine their free expression challenge under the O’Brien test\n\nas the majority does.      Nor would I apply any degree of heightened\n\nscrutiny.     Instead, I would ask simply “whether the regulation is\n\nreasonably intended to accomplish a constitutionally permissible\n\nstate objective”.     Karr, 460 F.2d at 616.         I conclude it is.\n\n                                      43\n\f                              III.\n\n     “[T]he [Supreme] Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for\n\naffirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school\n\nofficials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards,\n\nto prescribe and control conduct in the schools”. Tinker, 393 U.S.\n\nat 507 (emphasis added).   In accordance with state law, and in\n\nresponse to a perceived need, FISD has prescribed and controlled\n\nthe wearing of uniforms in its schools through a uniform policy\n\nthat is consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards.   We\n\nshould address this issue head-on.\n\n\n\n\n                               44\n\f",

St. Clair. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-Appellants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> are students and parents of students who attend schools situated in the Forney Independent School District (\"Forney\") in Forney, Texas. Plaintiffs-Appellants sued Defendants-Appellees asserting several constitutional challenges to the mandatory school uniform policy (\"Uniform Policy\" or \"Policy\") adopted by Forney.  Defendants-Appellees are Forney; Chester St. Clair, General Superintendent of Forney; and Keith Bell, Kenneth Cleaver, Clarence Doggan, Jay Calvin, Jim Jacobs, Rick Townsend, and David Walker, Members of the Forney Board of Trustees (collectively referred to hereinafter as \"Defendants\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1999, Forney, acting pursuant to Texas Education Code &#167; 11.162<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> adopted a district-wide mandatory Uniform Policy applicable to its students. The Uniform Policy apparently originated as a result of the efforts of General Superintendent St. Clair, who observed the successful implementation of uniform policies employed in other Texas school districts. In addition to St. Clair, school board members and school officials conferred with their counterparts at other Texas public schools and reviewed studies on the efficacy of school uniform policies. As found by the district court,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Clair came to the conclusion that the implementation of a school uniform program would, according to his research, have the following beneficial effects on the students and the system as a whole: improve student performance, instill self-confidence, foster self-esteem, increase attendance, decrease disciplinary referrals, and lower drop-out rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist., 108 F. Supp. 2d 681, 686 (N.D. Tex. 2000). Forney also sought input from parents regarding the proposed Policy. In March 1999, a \"take-home\" survey was sent home with elementary, middle, and junior-high school students in order to elicit parental approval of the proposed Uniform Policy. The district court found that, of the thirty-four percent of parents who responded, approximately sixty percent of that group was in favor of mandatory uniforms. Forney also conducted two \"town hall\" style meetings on the subject. At these meetings, parents were provided the opportunity to comment on the proposed Uniform Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of this information, the Forney School Board made factual findings that the school uniforms would improve the learning environment at the schools, and on April 19, 1999, adopted the Uniform Policy now at issue. The Uniform Policy applied to all 2,500 students in each of the schools within the district and was implemented at the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disputed Uniform Policy requires students to wear solid color polo-type shirts with collars, oxford-type shirts, or blouses with collars in one of four colors (white, yellow, red, or navy blue).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The shirts may be either short- or long-sleeved but must be tucked in at all times. Students must also wear either blue or khaki colored pants, shorts, skirts, or jumpers. The shorts and skirts must be of appropriate size and length (no shorter than three inches above the knee). The Policy prohibits the wearing of, inter alia, denim, leather, suede, or vinyl, or any clothing that suggests gang affiliation, could conceal contraband, or could create a distraction. Certain other clothing items are also banned, such as open-heeled sandals, flip-flops, military boots, overalls, athletic pants, spandex, baggy clothing, and sleeveless shirts. The Uniform Policy also regulates the sizes of manufacturer logos permitted on clothing. Prior to the adoption of the Policy, Forney had a dress code that prohibited certain types of clothing deemed unsafe, immodest, or otherwise inimical to the educational process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forney asserts that the Uniform Policy was adopted to promote school spirit and school values, and \"to promote decorum (and thereby the notion that school is a place of order and work), to promote respect for authority, to decrease socioeconomic tensions, to increase attendance, and to reduce drop out rates.\" Forney also asserts that it intended the Policy \"to increase student safety by reducing gang and drug related activity as well as the likelihood of students bringing weapons to school undetected and by allowing teachers to more readily distinguish Forney students from outsiders.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to comply with the Uniform Policy results in disciplinary action, which could lead to expulsion. As stated in the Forney District-Wide Student Handbook, \"if a non-exempt student attends school in violation of this uniform policy, the following disciplinary steps will be taken in order: [1] the student will be placed immediately in isolation on the campus, either until the parent can bring appropriate clothing or for the entire day, whichever comes first; [2] the student will be sent to BAM [Behavioral Adjustment Modification] for a minimum of 3 days for the second infraction; [3] if the student still refuses to comply, the student will remain in BAM for a maximum of two weeks; [4] if the student still refuses to comply following the two week BAM assignment, the principal will pursue due process for AEP [Alternative Education Program] or expulsion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In compliance with the requirement of Texas Education Code &#167; 11.162(c), the Uniform Policy includes an \"opt-out\" provision whereby parents and students with \"bona fide\" religious or philosophical objections to the wearing of a uniform can apply for an exemption to the Policy. The opt-out provision requires parents to request an Application for Exemption and fill out a questionnaire designed to gauge the sincerity of the beliefs of those parents who assert objections. This questionnaire asks whether the student has ever participated in any of a number of activities that would have required him or her to wear a uniform.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Families granted exemptions from the Uniform Policy must reapply each school year. A three-step grievance system was created to address issues arising from the opt-out procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the parents of seventy-two students sought exemptions from compliance with the Uniform Policy, of which twelve exemptions were granted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> A few of the Plaintiffs-Appellants were within the group of students who were granted exemptions from the Policy. Most students who had based their objections on philosophical or religious grounds were denied exemptions because they had worn some type of uniform in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several Plaintiffs-Appellants unsuccessfully sought exemption from the Uniform Policy through established administrative channels. Other Plaintiffs-Appellants refused to respond to the questionnaire based on constitutional or personal objections. Plaintiffs-Appellants then brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relevant to this appeal, Plaintiffs-Appellants bring three separate, substantive constitutional challenges to the Uniform Policy. First, the student-Plaintiffs-Appellants subject to the Uniform Policy assert that the compulsory wearing of uniforms violates the First Amendment because the wearing of uniforms is both a form of coerced speech, in that, it compels them to express ideas with which they may not agree, and, at the same time, it is an infringement on free expression, in that it prevents them from freely expressing particular messages they do wish to convey. Second, the parent-Plaintiffs-Appellants claim that the compulsory Uniform Policy violates their \"fundamental\" right to control the upbringing and education of their children in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, four family-Plaintiffs-Appellants (parents seeking relief on behalf of their children), who sought exemption from the Uniform Policy on religious grounds, allege that the existing opt-out procedures restrict their freedom to exercise their religious beliefs in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because the opt-out questionnaire and hearing procedures impermissibly delve into the substance of their religious beliefs. Further, these four family-Plaintiffs-Appellants contend that the opt-out procedures favor certain established religions at the expense of other religions and thus violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. The district court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants, concluding that no constitutional violation occurred in this case. The district court did not reach the qualified immunity issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs timely appeal the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. See Smith v. Brenoettsy, 158 F.3d 908, 911 (5th Cir. 1998); see also Tolson v. Avondale Indus., Inc., 141 F.3d 604, 608 (5th Cir. 1998). \"Summary judgment is proper 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The moving party bears the burden of showing the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. See id. at 325. \"If the moving party fails to meet this initial burden, the motion must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response. If the movant does, however, meet this burden, the nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Tubacex, Inc. v. M/V Risan, 45 F.3d 951, 954 (5th Cir. 1995). \"A dispute over a material fact is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'\" Smith, 158 F.3d at 911 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). The substantive law determines which facts are material. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. FIRST AMENDMENT EXPRESSIVE CONDUCT CLAIMS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment protects not only verbal and written expression, but also symbols and conduct that constitute \"symbolic speech.\" See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-06 (1969). As the Supreme Court explained in Texas v. Johnson:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have rejected the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled speech whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea, we have acknowledged that conduct may be sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">491 U.S. 397, 404 (1989) (citations and internal quotations omitted). In evaluating whether particular conduct possesses \"sufficient communicative elements\" to implicate First Amendment protections, courts must ask whether \"[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was present, and . . . [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.\" Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The protection of the First Amendment depends not only on whether the conduct is expressive, but also on the context in which that expression takes place. In the public school arena, the free expression rights of students are balanced by the corresponding interest of furthering the educational mission of schools. Compare Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506 (recognizing that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate\"), with Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266 (1988) (\"A school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission, even though the government could not censor similar speech outside the school.\" (citations and internal quotations omitted)), and Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 682 (1986) (recognizing that the First Amendment rights of public school students \"are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\"). Public schools, therefore, while responsible for inculcating the values of the First Amendment necessary for citizenship, are not themselves unbounded forums for practicing those freedoms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The student-Plaintiffs-Appellants (referred to in this section as the \"Students\") raise two separate free expression arguments based on the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The Students claim that the Uniform Policy acts as a form of \"coerced speech\" in that it forces the Students to convey a state-approved message that students do not wish to send,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977); West Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 633 (1943), and that the Uniform Policy acts as a \"prior restraint\" by preventing the Students from freely expressing any message at all through their attire (other than the state-approved message).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> See United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the choice of student clothing is not expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, and thus, any rational regulation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> of such nonexpressive conduct should survive constitutional scrutiny. Defendants also contend that the wearing of school uniforms does not convey a sufficiently particularized message to be considered coerced speech, see Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409 (1974), and thus cannot be considered a prior restraint on expression prohibited by the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> See Karr v. Schmidt, 460 F.2d 609, 613-14 (5th Cir. 1972) (en banc).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question, then, is whether the expression at issue is entitled to protection under the First Amendment. The district court agreed with Defendants and held that the mandatory Uniform Policy did not implicate \"expressive conduct\" protected by the First Amendment. See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 694 (relying on Spence, 418 U.S. at 409, and Karr, 460 F.2d at 613-14, to find student clothing not to be protected expression under the First Amendment). However, subsequent to the district court's issuance of its opinion, this court, in Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board, explicitly addressed the First Amendment implications of a mandatory school uniform policy and cast doubt on the district court's reasoning. See 240 F.3d 437, 440 (5th Cir. 2001) (disagreeing with the district court in Littlefield that the rationale in Karr could be applied to students' choice of attire).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Canady, this court resolved a First Amendment challenge to a mandatory school uniform policy adopted by the Bossier Parish School Board in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The Bossier uniform policy involved a similar requirement of one of several colors of collared shirts and a similar choice between blue or khaki pants. In addressing the threshold question of expression, this court assumed without deciding that \"an individual's choice of attire . . . may be endowed with sufficient levels of intentional expression to elicit First Amendment shelter.\" Id. Faced with an almost identical First Amendment challenge to a uniform policy, this court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person's choice of clothing is infused with intentional expression on many levels. In some instances, clothing functions as pure speech. A student may choose to wear shirts or jackets with written messages supporting political candidates or important social issues. Words printed on clothing qualify as pure speech and are protected under the First Amendment. . . . Clothing may also symbolize ethnic heritage, religious beliefs, and political and social views. Individuals regularly use their clothing to express ideas and opinions. . . . The choice to wear clothing as a symbol of an opinion or cause is undoubtedly protected under the First Amendment if the message is likely to be understood by those intended to view it. . . . Finally, students in particular often choose their attire with the intent to signify the social group to which they belong, their participation in different activities, and their general attitudes toward society and the school environment. While the message students intend to communicate about their identity and interests may be of little value to some adults, it has a considerable [e]ffect, whether positive or negative, on a young person's social development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 440-41 (citations omitted). The Canady court then went on to state that while \"this sort of expression may not convey a particularized message to warrant First Amendment protection in every instance, we cannot declare that expression of one's identity and affiliation to unique social groups through choice of clothing will never amount to protected speech.\" Id. at 441.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Assuming the First Amendment applies to the students' choice of expression, the court then applied the First Amendment framework of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968), relating to content-neutral restrictions on expressive activities, to hold that the Bossier Parish mandatory school uniform policy did not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this opinion, we follow the reasoning of the Canady court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and again, assume without deciding, that the First Amendment applies to the expressive conduct implicated in the mandatory Uniform Policy. However, applying the O'Brien test, we hold that the Uniform Policy does not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In O'Brien, the Supreme Court created an analytical framework to evaluate content-neutral restrictions on expressive activities. The Court held that \"when 'speech' and 'nonspeech' elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms.\" 391 U.S. at 376. Applying O'Brien to the challenged governmental policy at issue, the Uniform Policy will survive constitutional scrutiny if (1) it is within the constitutional power of the government, (2) it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest, (3) the interest is unrelated to the suppression of student expression, and (4) the incidental restrictions on First Amendment activities are no more than is necessary to facilitate that interest. See id. at 377. The O'Brien standard is applicable to both the Students' \"coerced speech\" arguments, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 716 (1977), and their \"prior restraint\"/\"free expression\" arguments. See Canady, 430 F.3d at 443.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have little difficulty in concluding that the Uniform Policy passes constitutional scrutiny under the O'Brien standard. First, there is no question that, pursuant to state law, Defendants have the power to pass a mandatory school uniform policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &#167; 11.162 (Vernon 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, improving the educational process is undoubtably an important and substantial interest of Forney and the school board. See Canady, 240 F.3d at 443; see also Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at 271-72. The Uniform Policy was adopted to improve student performance, instill self-confidence, foster self-esteem, increase attendance, decrease disciplinary referrals, and lower drop-out rates. See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 686. Such interests in the health, safety, and order of public schools are sufficient government interests under O'Brien. While the Students argue that Defendants have failed to produce evidence of any need to further these improvements in Forney, we are satisfied that, on this record, Defendants have established the requisite connection between the Uniform Policy and the stated interests in improving Forney schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As has been well recognized, federal courts should defer to school boards to decide, within constitutional bounds, what constitutes appropriate behavior and dress in public schools. See Canady, 240 F.3d at 441, 444 (\"[I]t is not the job of federal courts to determine the most effective way to educate our nation's youth.\"); see also Fraser, 478 U.S. at 683.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Students have not established issues of material fact sufficient to demonstrate that the Defendants' interest in enacting the Uniform Policy was to suppress expression. See O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377. The record demonstrates that the Uniform Policy was adopted for other legitimate reasons unrelated to the suppression of student expression. For example, Forney asserts that the Policy was implemented to increase safety by providing a means to differentiate Forney students from nonstudents who might enter Forney campuses. In addition, the Uniform Policy was intended to decrease socioeconomic disparities and tensions between students, increase attendance (because truants would be easily identified), and reduce gang and drug-related activity, as well as the likelihood of students bringing weapons to school undetected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Following Canady, we hold that Forney's purpose in enacting the Uniform Policy cannot be deemed an attempt to suppress or coerce speech. Cf. Canady, 240 F.3d at 443 (\"The School Board's purpose for enacting the uniform policy is to increase test scores and reduce disciplinary problems throughout the school system. This purpose is in no way related to the suppression of student speech.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are satisfied that, because of the limited nature of the restriction, \"the incidental restrictions on First Amendment activities are no more than is necessary to facilitate [Forney's] interest.\" O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377. The restrictions pertain only to student attire during school hours and do not affect other means of communication. Again, following Canady,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although students are restricted from wearing clothing of their choice at school, students remain free to wear what they want after school hours. Students may still express their views through other mediums during the school day. The uniform requirement does not bar the important \"personal intercommunication among students\" necessary to an effective educational process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 443 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 512). Thus, we hold that the Uniform Policy survives First Amendment scrutiny under the O'Brien test and, because there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding the application of the O'Brien test, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV.

XIV, &#167; 1. As the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed: \"We have long recognized that the Amendment's Due Process Clause, like its Fifth Amendment counterpart, 'guarantees more than fair process.' The Clause also includes a substantive component that 'provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.'\" Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) (quoting Washington v.

Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923) (recognizing that the liberty interest protected by due process includes the right of parents \"to control the education of their own\"); Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-35 (1925) (recognizing that \"the liberty of parents and guardians\" includes the right \"to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control\"); Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944) (recognizing that there is a constitutional interest in parents directing the \"custody, care and nurture of the child\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parent-Plaintiffs-Appellants (referred to in this section as the \"Parents\") argue that their right to control their children's education is a fundamental right entitled to heightened constitutional protection. Specifically, the Parents claim that the mandatory school uniforms interfere with their parental rights to teach their children to be guided by one's own conscience in making decisions, to understand the importance of appropriate grooming and attire, to understand the importance of one's own individuality, and to respect the individuality of others. The Parents argue that the implementation of mandatory uniforms presumes that parents are either incapable or unwilling to act in the best interests of their children. Because the Parents assert that this right of \"control\" has been recognized as \"fundamental,\" see Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65, the Parents contend that a \"strict-scrutiny\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> level of analysis must be applied to the Uniform Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue, in contrast, that while parents may have a fundamental liberty interest in their children's upbringing, this interest cannot usurp the state's role in determining appropriate behavior at public schools, including the role of determining appropriate dress codes in the district. Defendants argue that notwithstanding the Supreme Court's recent reaffirmation of parental rights as fundamental rights in Troxel, that decision does not in any way extend parents' rights to frustrate basic school rules reasonably required to regulate the educational system. Defendants argue, therefore, that a rational-relationship/rational-basis<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> test is the appropriate standard to judge the school Uniform Policy at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with Defendants and applied a rational-basis test, concluding that Forney's Uniform Policy did not infringe the Parents' fundamental right to control the rearing and education of their children. See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 703. The district court rejected the Parents' argument that the Supreme Court's determination in Troxel -- that the Due Process Clause protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children -- could be read to cover complaints about a school Uniform Policy. See id. at 702 (\"The fundamental right of filiation and companionship with one's children, which the Supreme Court examined in Troxel, is an entirely different balance of interests from the right of parents to send their children to a public school in clothes of their own choosing.\"). We agree with the impressively reasoned decision of the district court on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Troxel, the Court struck down a Washington State statute that allowed \"any person,\" including a grandparent, to petition for visitation rights at any time, if it was in the best interests of the child. See 530 U.S. at 63. The Court found the statute offensive to the parental rights of the mother in that it unconstitutionally interfered with the mother's right to make decisions concerning the upbringing of her child. See id. at 69-70. While the Supreme Court in Troxel recognized that there exists a fundamental right of parents to direct their children's upbringing, it failed to articulate a standard of judicial scrutiny to be applied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> See id. at 80 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"The opinions of the plurality, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter recognize such a right, but curiously none of them articulates the appropriate standard of review.\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispositive question at issue is whether the sweeping statements of the plurality opinion in Troxel regarding the \"fundamental\" \"interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children,\" see id. at 65, mandate a strict standard of scrutiny for the Parents' Fourteenth Amendment challenge to the Uniform Policy. We do not read Troxel to create a fundamental right for parents to control the clothing their children wear to public schools and, thus, instead follow almost eighty years of precedent analyzing parental rights in the context of public education under a rational-basis standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Supreme Court's Troxel opinion, the Court had addressed the issue of parental rights in public schools in three major opinions. First, in Meyer v. Nebraska, the Court held unconstitutional a law that forbade schools from teaching foreign languages to students below the eighth grade, applying the equivalent of a rational-basis review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> See 262 U.S. 390, 396-97, 403 (1923) (\"We are constrained to conclude that the statute as applied is arbitrary, and without reasonable relation to any end within the competency of the state.\" (emphasis added)). The Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right \"to marry, establish a home, and bring up children.\" Id. at 399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years later, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Court struck down a state law prohibiting parents from sending their children to private school, again utilizing the equivalent of a rational-basis test. See 268 U.S. 510, 530-31 (1925). The Court invalidated the statute because it \"unreasonably interfer[ed] with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\" Id. at 534-35 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in Wisconsin v. Yoder, members of the Old Order Amish religion and the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church argued that mandatory school attendance beyond the eighth grade violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. See 406 U.S. 205, 207 (1972). The Supreme Court agreed that, as it applied to the Amish, the state law was unconstitutional. See id. at 234. Yoder was decided based on the Free Exercise Clause, but it informs the discussion about the balancing of interests regarding parental rights implicated under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court acknowledged both the state interest in providing and regulating a state public education system and the parental interest in controlling a child's religious upbringing and education. See id. at 213-14. As the district court in this case reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understanding the full import of Yoder, which refined the parental rights announced in Meyer and Pierce, is critical to properly analyze the claims presented in the present case. In Yoder, the Supreme Court, while reaffirming the general notion that parental rights are a protected liberty interest under the due process clause, recognized the \"high responsibility\" and regulatory power of the state in matters of public education. Furthermore, while fundamental religious practices may excuse parents from complying with educational policies, secular objections to such policies are insufficient to avoid compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 699 (emphasis added). The Yoder Court went on to state that \"[a] way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation of education if it is based on purely secular considerations.\" Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as the district court recognized: \"[w]hile the Court employed more than a rational basis standard with reference to the First Amendment free exercise clause, it is clear that the due process interest of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children, standing alone, warranted no more than rational-basis review.\" Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 699. As such, the district court concluded that Meyer, Pierce, and Yoder, taken together, support the argument that a rational-basis review is the appropriate standard in this case. This conclusion is in accord with other circuit courts of appeals that have addressed the issue, pre-Troxel. See Herndon v. Chapel Hill -- Carrboro City Bd. of Educ., 89 F.3d 174, 177-79 (4th Cir. 1996); Immediato v. Rye Neck Sch. Dist., 73 F.3d 454, 461 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Troxel does not change the above reasoning in the context of parental rights concerning public education. While Parents may have a fundamental right in the upbringing and education of their children, this right does not cover the Parents' objection to a public school Uniform Policy. It has long been recognized that parental rights are not absolute in the public school context and can be subject to reasonable regulation. See, e.g., Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 177 (1976) (recognizing no parental right to educate children in private segregated academies); Kite v. Marshall, 661 F.2d 1027, 1029 (5th Cir. 1981); see also Swanson v. Guthrie Indep. Sch. Dist., 135 F.3d 694, 698 (10th Cir. 1998) (recognizing that cases in this area establish that \"parents simply do not have a constitutional right to control each and every aspect of their children's education and oust the state's authority over that subject\"); Brown v. Hot, Sexy &amp; Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 533 (1st Cir. 1995); Fleischfresser v. Dir. of Sch. Dist. 200, 15 F.3d 680, 690 (7th Cir. 1994); Murphy v. Arkansas, 852 F.2d 1039, 1044 (8th Cir. 1988); Fellowship Baptist Church v. Benton, 815 F.2d 485, 491 (8th Cir. 1987). These cases support the determinations in Meyer, Pierce, and Yoder that a rational-basis test is the appropriate level of scrutiny for parental rights in the public school context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the rational-basis test, we conclude that the Uniform Policy is rationally related to the state's interest in fostering the education of its children and furthering the legitimate goals of improving student safety, decreasing socioeconomic tensions, increasing attendance, and reducing drop-out rates. Therefore, we affirm the district court's summary judgment determination that the Uniform Policy does not violate the Parents' Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

The district court properly dismissed these First Amendment challenges in its well-reasoned opinion. See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 703-08.

City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993) (\"In addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its face, the opt-out policy enacted by Forney is neutral and of general application, in that it applies to all persons who might wish to attend Forney and choose to opt-out of the Uniform Policy. All parties also agree that the opt-out policy was not enacted to inhibit religion and, in fact, recognize that the statutory provision was enacted to protect the reasonable state interest of fostering the free exercise of religion.

See Patrick v. LeFevre, 745 F.2d 153, 157 (2d Cir. 1984) (\"Sincerity analysis seeks to determine an adherent's good faith in the expression of his religious belief. This test provides a rational means of differentiating between those beliefs that are held as a matter of conscience and those that are animated by motives of deception and fraud.\" (citations omitted)); see also Hernandez v.

Further, in practice, \"opt-outs\" have been granted to parents who have demonstrated a sincere and consistent objection to the wearing of uniforms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Therefore, we conclude that the Families have not created a genuine issue of material fact that the application of Forney's opt-out policy violates their free exercise rights under the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Next, the principal effect neither advances nor inhibits religion. Its purpose is to enhance the learning environment in the Forney schools, irrespective of the religious faith of a particular student. Finally, the policy does not unnecessarily entangle the School Board with religion. The uniform policy references religion only in the context of exemptions. There is no evidence to suggest that as a result of the uniform policy, the School Board must routinely or even occasionally become involved in religious matters. Less than one hundred exemption requests, out of nearly 2,500 students, were considered by the School Board, and the vast majority concerned secular opt-out requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Littlefield, 108 F.

None of the families raising the Establishment Clause challenge can point to any religious purpose behind the implementation of the opt-out policy. Nor can these families point to any \"primary effect\" of the opt-out policy that advances a particular religion or that inhibits a religion. On this record, it appears that those families that could demonstrate sincere and consistent rejection of mandatory uniforms were granted exemptions regardless of the particular tenets of their faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Finally, we do not perceive an intolerable risk of excessive government entanglement in the requirement that parents demonstrate their consistency and sincerity by explaining the basis of their religious objections to Defendants.

Student Uniform Policy specifically provides that if a student persists in his refusal to comply with the uniform policy, his ultimate sanction is the alternative education program or expulsion. Thus, it is apparent that the penalty of expulsion from school may be imposed on those students who, for whatever reason, refuse to wear the prescribed uniform. Moreover, Plaintiffs seek remedies, including damages, for injuries which have already occurred. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have established a particularized, imminent or actual injury, for purposes of Article III.</p>\n        <p>See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 688. We agree. Students and parents may challenge unconstitutional actions in the public schools that directly affect the students. See e.g., Sch. Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 224 (1963) (\"The parties here are school children and their parents, who are directly affected by the laws and practices against which their complaints are directed. These interests surely suffice to give the parties standing to complain.\"). Of course, as will be discussed infra in the text, each subset of the Plaintiffs-Appellants (\"Students,\" \"Parents,\" and the four families with religious objections) has standing only to challenge the particular legal claim for which that subset can demonstrate injury, causation, and redressability.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Regarding the \"coerced speech\" argument, the Students argue that mandatory uniforms convey a particularized message that the school district wishes to express, namely that students have respect for the authority of teachers and administrators, have Forney school and civic pride, and support the school policies. The Students argue that this message is also understood by school officials, students, and the public, which is the exact reason why the Uniform Policy was adopted (or else it would have no rational purpose). The Students also adduced evidence from student depositions that these students did not wish to convey the message intended by Forney. Thus, the Students conclude that mandatory uniforms coerce students to convey a particular message, which Forney wishes them to express, but which they oppose.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> As to the \"prior restraint\" argument, the Students argue that because the Uniform Policy precludes the use of clothing to express any message -- no matter how specific or particularized -- and that school children do wear clothing that sends political, cultural, and social messages, this restriction is a content-based prior restraint on speech.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Defendants contend that this court should review the Uniform Policy under rational-basis scrutiny.

Further, Defendants argue that there is no evidence that other people at school would be likely to understand the students' message of \"individuality.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> In Karr, this court rejected a constitutional challenge to a portion of a public school dress code that regulated the length of hair for boys. See 460 F.2d at 613-14. The court determined that the decision to wear long hair is not expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. See id. at 614 (\"[W]e think it inappropriate that the protection of the First Amendment be extended to the wearing of long hair.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The court further qualified its conclusion:</p>\n        <p>We do not conclude that every choice of clothing expresses a particularized message, and we make no judgment as to the extent or type of clothing necessary to communicate a discrete message in order to afford First Amendment protection. Our analysis simply acknowledges that certain choices of clothing may have sufficient communicative content to qualify as First Amendment activity.</p>\n        <p>Canady, 240 F.3d at 441 n.3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> At issue in Canady was only a \"prior restraint\"-type argument. However, the assumption that student clothing, and thus the Uniform Policy, implicates expressive conduct also applies to the \"coerced speech\" challenge. In fact, as discussed infra in the text, the requirement that all students wear a certain type of uniform in order to further a certain particularized message of the school district is arguably a stronger justification to find potential expressive conduct and, thus, to apply Canady and O'Brien. The Students have set forth affidavits from Forney officials that the Uniform Policy was intended to express a particular institutional image. In deposition testimony, Forney school officials stated that the purpose of the uniform was, inter alia, to convey respect for \"the values of the Forney schools\" and the \"City of Forney.\" Thus, because Forney implemented the Uniform Policy with the intention of conveying that message, we find it permissible to assume that the expression involved was intentional and particularized and, thus, follow the logic of Canady in evaluating the coerced speech claim. As in Canady, however, we need not and do not decide the issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs-Appellants concede that &#167; 11.162 of the Texas Education Code is constitutional.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The Forney School Board Policy included findings by the Board that the requirement of wearing school uniforms would improve the learning environment in the district.

Government actions that burden the exercise of those fundamental rights or liberty interests are subject to strict scrutiny and will be upheld only when they are narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993) (reaffirming that due process \"forbids the government to infringe certain 'fundamental' liberty interests at all, . . . unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> See supra note 10.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The Court also failed to reach agreement on the parameters of the right at issue.

Each family has alleged that the opt-out policy, by requiring them to explain, defend, and conform their religious practices in an effort not to have their children disciplined or expelled from school, thereby infringes on their right to freely exercise their religious beliefs. Due to the opt-out policy, the McLaren/Johnson family removed Natalie from the Forney school district, rather than be subject to what they allege was a violation of their First Amendment rights. The Penn/Anderson family and the Tapleys refused to participate in the opt-out questionnaire, claiming that the procedures themselves were violative of their religious freedom. The Lowerys were granted a religious exemption, but because the policy requires them to re-apply every year, they claim that the policy threatens a future injury.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> See Cantwell v.

See Smith, 494 U.S. at 881 (\"The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections.\").

For example, the Lowerys initially refused to fill out the questionnaire. On appeal to the Board of Trustees, however, the Lowerys were granted an exemption based on their stated belief that their Native American ancestry combined with their Catholic beliefs deriving from their interpretation of the \"Vatican II\" proscribed the wearing of uniforms.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> For example, Mr. and Mrs. J.M. stated in response to an opt-out request for Judy M., a Forney student, that Mr. M.'s \"negative personal experience\" with uniforms in Catholic school created a sincere belief that Judy M. should not wear a uniform. Further, they answered \"no\" to all relevant questions regarding their child's previous wearing of uniforms. The exemption was granted for Judy M. In similar fashion, Mr. O., father of a Forney student Patrick O., indicated that he had pulled his children out of Catholic school, partly because of his objections to uniforms. Mr. O. also responded to the questionnaire with \"no\" to each item. Again, the exemption was granted.

They rely on the Court's statement that \"a narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a 'particularized message,' would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock, music of Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll\".

Accordingly, for determining what -- if any -- expressive content there is in wearing the school uniform at issue, we must follow Canady's instruction and engage in the two-part Spence analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Students have proffered some evidence that the Forney Independent School District (FISD) intended to convey a message in adopting the uniform policy -- namely, pride in and respect for the values of FISD and its schools -- I question whether such a message is sufficiently particularized as to satisfy Spence. But, even if FISD did intend that message, I doubt there is any likelihood whatsoever, no less the \"great likelihood\" required by Spence, that such a message would be understood by anyone who happens to see students' blue or khaki trousers (or skirt) and solid-colored shirt. When worn in the factual context and environment in which students are required to wear the uniform -- that is, school -- the uniform conveys at most the following message: that the wearer is a student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly I would hold that, as a matter of law, the wearing of a school uniform devoid of any logo, symbol, or motto -- like the wearing of long hair that was at issue in this court's en banc decision in Karr v. Schmidt, 460 F.2d 609 (5th Cir. 1972)(en banc), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 989 (1972) -- does not involve \"sufficient communicative content\" to qualify as expression for First Amendment purposes. Consequently, the requirement to wear such a uniform cannot constitute coerced speech. As the Supreme Court implied in Hurley, where the disfavored message is \"difficult to identify\", there is no risk that the allegedly coerced party is forced \"to propound a particular point of view\". Hurley, 515 U.S. at 574-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, deciding that the wearing of such a school uniform is not expressive conduct alleviates the need to examine the coercion claim under the four-part O'Brien test regarding content-neutral restrictions on expressive conduct. See United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). Indeed, I question whether O'Brien applies to school uniform cases. See, e.g., Phoenix Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Green, 943 P.2d 836 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1997) (school uniform policy is a content-neutral regulation of the medium, not the message; accordingly, nonpublic forum analysis is the appropriate test); see also Canady, 240 F.3d at 443 (noting the similarity of O'Brien to traditional time, place, manner analysis). But that question is best left for another day. Because coercion to wear the uniform at issue is not coercion to speak, there is no need to apply any degree of heightened scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My conclusion that the wearing of the school uniform at issue is not expressive does not, of course, dictate a result with regard to the Students' other First Amendment claim: restraint on free expression. For even if the uniform is not imbued with expressive value, the uniform policy still precludes the Students from wearing clothing of their choice that may be expressive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing this second claim, the majority again follows the lead of the Canady court in assuming that the uniform policy implicates expressive clothing choices. Accordingly, the majority proceeds with the O'Brien analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"certain choices of clothing may have sufficient communicative content to qualify as First Amendment activity\", Canady, 240 F.3d at 441 n.3, the present record contains only vague depictions of messages the Students supposedly intend to convey through clothing choice. The deposition testimony of one Student is typical:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I mean, I don't like them [school uniforms]. I don't like that we have to wear the same thing every day. It's a routine that I don't like to be in. I don't like to be told what to wear. I would rather wear something that expresses who I am.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, the various \"messages\" proffered by Students in their depositions may be loosely grouped around the concept of individuality. But, I cannot agree -- nor will I assume -- that such a message satisfies the two-part Spence test for discerning expressive conduct. Because the Students have failed to articulate a particularized message likely to be understood by anyone, I would not examine their free expression challenge under the O'Brien test as the majority does. Nor would I apply any degree of heightened scrutiny. Instead, I would ask simply \"whether the regulation is reasonably intended to accomplish a constitutionally permissible state objective\". Karr, 460 F.2d at 616. I conclude it is.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he [Supreme] Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools\". Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507 (emphasis added). In accordance with state law, and in response to a perceived need, FISD has prescribed and controlled the wearing of uniforms in its schools through a uniform policy that is consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards. We should address this issue head-on.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

St. Clair. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-Appellants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> are students and parents of students who attend schools situated in the Forney Independent School District (\"Forney\") in Forney, Texas. Plaintiffs-Appellants sued Defendants-Appellees asserting several constitutional challenges to the mandatory school uniform policy (\"Uniform Policy\" or \"Policy\") adopted by Forney.  Defendants-Appellees are Forney; Chester St. Clair, General Superintendent of Forney; and Keith Bell, Kenneth Cleaver, Clarence Doggan, Jay Calvin, Jim Jacobs, Rick Townsend, and David Walker, Members of the Forney Board of Trustees (collectively referred to hereinafter as \"Defendants\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1999, Forney, acting pursuant to Texas Education Code &#167; 11.162<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> adopted a district-wide mandatory Uniform Policy applicable to its students. The Uniform Policy apparently originated as a result of the efforts of General Superintendent St. Clair, who observed the successful implementation of uniform policies employed in other Texas school districts. In addition to St. Clair, school board members and school officials conferred with their counterparts at other Texas public schools and reviewed studies on the efficacy of school uniform policies. As found by the district court,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Clair came to the conclusion that the implementation of a school uniform program would, according to his research, have the following beneficial effects on the students and the system as a whole: improve student performance, instill self-confidence, foster self-esteem, increase attendance, decrease disciplinary referrals, and lower drop-out rates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428673\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428673/littlefield-v-forney-ind-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>, 686 (N.D. Tex. 2000). Forney also sought input from parents regarding the proposed Policy. In March 1999, a \"take-home\" survey was sent home with elementary, middle, and junior-high school students in order to elicit parental approval of the proposed Uniform Policy. The district court found that, of the thirty-four percent of parents who responded, approximately sixty percent of that group was in favor of mandatory uniforms. Forney also conducted two \"town hall\" style meetings on the subject. At these meetings, parents were provided the opportunity to comment on the proposed Uniform Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of this information, the Forney School Board made factual findings that the school uniforms would improve the learning environment at the schools, and on April 19, 1999, adopted the Uniform Policy now at issue. The Uniform Policy applied to all 2,500 students in each of the schools within the district and was implemented at the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disputed Uniform Policy requires students to wear solid color polo-type shirts with collars, oxford-type shirts, or blouses with collars in one of four colors (white, yellow, red, or navy blue).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The shirts may be either short- or long-sleeved but must be tucked in at all times. Students must also wear either blue or khaki colored pants, shorts, skirts, or jumpers. The shorts and skirts must be of appropriate size and length (no shorter than three inches above the knee). The Policy prohibits the wearing of, inter alia, denim, leather, suede, or vinyl, or any clothing that suggests gang affiliation, could conceal contraband, or could create a distraction. Certain other clothing items are also banned, such as open-heeled sandals, flip-flops, military boots, overalls, athletic pants, spandex, baggy clothing, and sleeveless shirts. The Uniform Policy also regulates the sizes of manufacturer logos permitted on clothing. Prior to the adoption of the Policy, Forney had a dress code that prohibited certain types of clothing deemed unsafe, immodest, or otherwise inimical to the educational process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forney asserts that the Uniform Policy was adopted to promote school spirit and school values, and \"to promote decorum (and thereby the notion that school is a place of order and work), to promote respect for authority, to decrease socioeconomic tensions, to increase attendance, and to reduce drop out rates.\" Forney also asserts that it intended the Policy \"to increase student safety by reducing gang and drug related activity as well as the likelihood of students bringing weapons to school undetected and by allowing teachers to more readily distinguish Forney students from outsiders.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to comply with the Uniform Policy results in disciplinary action, which could lead to expulsion. As stated in the Forney District-Wide Student Handbook, \"if a non-exempt student attends school in violation of this uniform policy, the following disciplinary steps will be taken in order: [1] the student will be placed immediately in isolation on the campus, either until the parent can bring appropriate clothing or for the entire day, whichever comes first; [2] the student will be sent to BAM [Behavioral Adjustment Modification] for a minimum of 3 days for the second infraction; [3] if the student still refuses to comply, the student will remain in BAM for a maximum of two weeks; [4] if the student still refuses to comply following the two week BAM assignment, the principal will pursue due process for AEP [Alternative Education Program] or expulsion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In compliance with the requirement of Texas Education Code &#167; 11.162(c), the Uniform Policy includes an \"opt-out\" provision whereby parents and students with \"bona fide\" religious or philosophical objections to the wearing of a uniform can apply for an exemption to the Policy. The opt-out provision requires parents to request an Application for Exemption and fill out a questionnaire designed to gauge the sincerity of the beliefs of those parents who assert objections. This questionnaire asks whether the student has ever participated in any of a number of activities that would have required him or her to wear a uniform.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Families granted exemptions from the Uniform Policy must reapply each school year. A three-step grievance system was created to address issues arising from the opt-out procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the parents of seventy-two students sought exemptions from compliance with the Uniform Policy, of which twelve exemptions were granted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> A few of the Plaintiffs-Appellants were within the group of students who were granted exemptions from the Policy. Most students who had based their objections on philosophical or religious grounds were denied exemptions because they had worn some type of uniform in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several Plaintiffs-Appellants unsuccessfully sought exemption from the Uniform Policy through established administrative channels. Other Plaintiffs-Appellants refused to respond to the questionnaire based on constitutional or personal objections. Plaintiffs-Appellants then brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relevant to this appeal, Plaintiffs-Appellants bring three separate, substantive constitutional challenges to the Uniform Policy. First, the student-Plaintiffs-Appellants subject to the Uniform Policy assert that the compulsory wearing of uniforms violates the First Amendment because the wearing of uniforms is both a form of coerced speech, in that, it compels them to express ideas with which they may not agree, and, at the same time, it is an infringement on free expression, in that it prevents them from freely expressing particular messages they do wish to convey. Second, the parent-Plaintiffs-Appellants claim that the compulsory Uniform Policy violates their \"fundamental\" right to control the upbringing and education of their children in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, four family-Plaintiffs-Appellants (parents seeking relief on behalf of their children), who sought exemption from the Uniform Policy on religious grounds, allege that the existing opt-out procedures restrict their freedom to exercise their religious beliefs in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because the opt-out questionnaire and hearing procedures impermissibly delve into the substance of their religious beliefs. Further, these four family-Plaintiffs-Appellants contend that the opt-out procedures favor certain established religions at the expense of other religions and thus violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. The district court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants, concluding that no constitutional violation occurred in this case. The district court did not reach the qualified immunity issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs timely appeal the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

The district court agreed with Defendants and held that the mandatory Uniform Policy did not implicate \"expressive conduct\" protected by the First Amendment. See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 694 (relying on Spence, 418 U.S. at 409, and Karr, 460 F.2d at 613-14, to find student clothing not to be protected expression under the First Amendment). However, subsequent to the district court's issuance of its opinion, this court, in Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board, explicitly addressed the First Amendment implications of a mandatory school uniform policy and cast doubt on the district court's reasoning. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"22987\"><a href=\"/opinion/22987/canady-v-bossier-parish-sch/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 440 (5th Cir. 2001) (disagreeing with the district court in Littlefield that the rationale in Karr could be applied to students' choice of attire).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Canady, this court resolved a First Amendment challenge to a mandatory school uniform policy adopted by the Bossier Parish School Board in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The Bossier uniform policy involved a similar requirement of one of several colors of collared shirts and a similar choice between blue or khaki pants. In addressing the threshold question of expression, this court assumed without deciding that \"an individual's choice of attire . . . may be endowed with sufficient levels of intentional expression to elicit First Amendment shelter.\" Id. Faced with an almost identical First Amendment challenge to a uniform policy, this court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person's choice of clothing is infused with intentional expression on many levels. In some instances, clothing functions as pure speech. A student may choose to wear shirts or jackets with written messages supporting political candidates or important social issues. Words printed on clothing qualify as pure speech and are protected under the First Amendment. . . . Clothing may also symbolize ethnic heritage, religious beliefs, and political and social views. Individuals regularly use their clothing to express ideas and opinions. . . . The choice to wear clothing as a symbol of an opinion or cause is undoubtedly protected under the First Amendment if the message is likely to be understood by those intended to view it. . . . Finally, students in particular often choose their attire with the intent to signify the social group to which they belong, their participation in different activities, and their general attitudes toward society and the school environment. While the message students intend to communicate about their identity and interests may be of little value to some adults, it has a considerable [e]ffect, whether positive or negative, on a young person's social development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 440-41 (citations omitted). The Canady court then went on to state that while \"this sort of expression may not convey a particularized message to warrant First Amendment protection in every instance, we cannot declare that expression of one's identity and affiliation to unique social groups through choice of clothing will never amount to protected speech.\" Id. at 441.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Assuming the First Amendment applies to the students' choice of expression, the court then applied the First Amendment framework of United States v. O'Brien, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 377 (1968), relating to content-neutral restrictions on expressive activities, to hold that the Bossier Parish mandatory school uniform policy did not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this opinion, we follow the reasoning of the Canady court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and again, assume without deciding, that the First Amendment applies to the expressive conduct implicated in the mandatory Uniform Policy. However, applying the O'Brien test, we hold that the Uniform Policy does not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In O'Brien, the Supreme Court created an analytical framework to evaluate content-neutral restrictions on expressive activities. The Court held that \"when 'speech' and 'nonspeech' elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms.\" 391 U.S. at 376. Applying O'Brien to the challenged governmental policy at issue, the Uniform Policy will survive constitutional scrutiny if (1) it is within the constitutional power of the government, (2) it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest, (3) the interest is unrelated to the suppression of student expression, and (4) the incidental restrictions on First Amendment activities are no more than is necessary to facilitate that interest. See id. at 377. The O'Brien standard is applicable to both the Students' \"coerced speech\" arguments, see Wooley v. Maynard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109638\"><a href=\"/opinion/109638/wooley-v-maynard/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 716 (1977), and their \"prior restraint\"/\"free expression\" arguments. See Canady, 430 F.3d at 443.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have little difficulty in concluding that the Uniform Policy passes constitutional scrutiny under the O'Brien standard. First, there is no question that, pursuant to state law, Defendants have the power to pass a mandatory school uniform policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See Tex.

See Canady, 240 F.3d at 443; see also Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at 271-72. The Uniform Policy was adopted to improve student performance, instill self-confidence, foster self-esteem, increase attendance, decrease disciplinary referrals, and lower drop-out rates. See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 686. Such interests in the health, safety, and order of public schools are sufficient government interests under O'Brien. While the Students argue that Defendants have failed to produce evidence of any need to further these improvements in Forney, we are satisfied that, on this record, Defendants have established the requisite connection between the Uniform Policy and the stated interests in improving Forney schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As has been well recognized, federal courts should defer to school boards to decide, within constitutional bounds, what constitutes appropriate behavior and dress in public schools. See Canady, 240 F.3d at 441, 444 (\"[I]t is not the job of federal courts to determine the most effective way to educate our nation's youth.\"); see also Fraser, 478 U.S. at 683.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Students have not established issues of material fact sufficient to demonstrate that the Defendants' interest in enacting the Uniform Policy was to suppress expression. See O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377. The record demonstrates that the Uniform Policy was adopted for other legitimate reasons unrelated to the suppression of student expression. For example, Forney asserts that the Policy was implemented to increase safety by providing a means to differentiate Forney students from nonstudents who might enter Forney campuses. In addition, the Uniform Policy was intended to decrease socioeconomic disparities and tensions between students, increase attendance (because truants would be easily identified), and reduce gang and drug-related activity, as well as the likelihood of students bringing weapons to school undetected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Following Canady, we hold that Forney's purpose in enacting the Uniform Policy cannot be deemed an attempt to suppress or coerce speech. Cf. Canady, 240 F.3d at 443 (\"The School Board's purpose for enacting the uniform policy is to increase test scores and reduce disciplinary problems throughout the school system. This purpose is in no way related to the suppression of student speech.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are satisfied that, because of the limited nature of the restriction, \"the incidental restrictions on First Amendment activities are no more than is necessary to facilitate [Forney's] interest.\" O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377. The restrictions pertain only to student attire during school hours and do not affect other means of communication. Again, following Canady,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although students are restricted from wearing clothing of their choice at school, students remain free to wear what they want after school hours. Students may still express their views through other mediums during the school day. The uniform requirement does not bar the important \"personal intercommunication among students\" necessary to an effective educational process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 443 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 512). Thus, we hold that the Uniform Policy survives First Amendment scrutiny under the O'Brien test and, because there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding the application of the O'Brien test, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Specifically, the Parents claim that the mandatory school uniforms interfere with their parental rights to teach their children to be guided by one's own conscience in making decisions, to understand the importance of appropriate grooming and attire, to understand the importance of one's own individuality, and to respect the individuality of others. The Parents argue that the implementation of mandatory uniforms presumes that parents are either incapable or unwilling to act in the best interests of their children. Because the Parents assert that this right of \"control\" has been recognized as \"fundamental,\" see Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65, the Parents contend that a \"strict-scrutiny\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> level of analysis must be applied to the Uniform Policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue, in contrast, that while parents may have a fundamental liberty interest in their children's upbringing, this interest cannot usurp the state's role in determining appropriate behavior at public schools, including the role of determining appropriate dress codes in the district. Defendants argue that notwithstanding the Supreme Court's recent reaffirmation of parental rights as fundamental rights in Troxel, that decision does not in any way extend parents' rights to frustrate basic school rules reasonably required to regulate the educational system. Defendants argue, therefore, that a rational-relationship/rational-basis<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> test is the appropriate standard to judge the school Uniform Policy at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with Defendants and applied a rational-basis test, concluding that Forney's Uniform Policy did not infringe the Parents' fundamental right to control the rearing and education of their children. See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 703. The district court rejected the Parents' argument that the Supreme Court's determination in Troxel -- that the Due Process Clause protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children -- could be read to cover complaints about a school Uniform Policy. See id. at 702 (\"The fundamental right of filiation and companionship with one's children, which the Supreme Court examined in Troxel, is an entirely different balance of interests from the right of parents to send their children to a public school in clothes of their own choosing.\"). We agree with the impressively reasoned decision of the district court on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Troxel, the Court struck down a Washington State statute that allowed \"any person,\" including a grandparent, to petition for visitation rights at any time, if it was in the best interests of the child. See 530 U.S. at 63. The Court found the statute offensive to the parental rights of the mother in that it unconstitutionally interfered with the mother's right to make decisions concerning the upbringing of her child. See id. at 69-70. While the Supreme Court in Troxel recognized that there exists a fundamental right of parents to direct their children's upbringing, it failed to articulate a standard of judicial scrutiny to be applied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> See id. at 80 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"The opinions of the plurality, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter recognize such a right, but curiously none of them articulates the appropriate standard of review.\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispositive question at issue is whether the sweeping statements of the plurality opinion in Troxel regarding the \"fundamental\" \"interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children,\" see id. at 65, mandate a strict standard of scrutiny for the Parents' Fourteenth Amendment challenge to the Uniform Policy. We do not read Troxel to create a fundamental right for parents to control the clothing their children wear to public schools and, thus, instead follow almost eighty years of precedent analyzing parental rights in the context of public education under a rational-basis standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Supreme Court's Troxel opinion, the Court had addressed the issue of parental rights in public schools in three major opinions. First, in Meyer v. Nebraska, the Court held unconstitutional a law that forbade schools from teaching foreign languages to students below the eighth grade, applying the equivalent of a rational-basis review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100233\"><a href=\"/opinion/100233/meyer-v-nebraska/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 396-97, 403 (1923) (\"We are constrained to conclude that the statute as applied is arbitrary, and without reasonable relation to any end within the competency of the state.\" (emphasis added)). The Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right \"to marry, establish a home, and bring up children.\" Id. at 399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years later, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Court struck down a state law prohibiting parents from sending their children to private school, again utilizing the equivalent of a rational-basis test. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100694\"><a href=\"/opinion/100694/pierce-v-society-of-sisters/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 530-31 (1925). The Court invalidated the statute because it \"unreasonably interfer[ed] with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\" Id. at 534-35 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in Wisconsin v. Yoder, members of the Old Order Amish religion and the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church argued that mandatory school attendance beyond the eighth grade violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108530\"><a href=\"/opinion/108530/wisconsin-v-yoder/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 207 (1972). The Supreme Court agreed that, as it applied to the Amish, the state law was unconstitutional. See id. at 234. Yoder was decided based on the Free Exercise Clause, but it informs the discussion about the balancing of interests regarding parental rights implicated under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court acknowledged both the state interest in providing and regulating a state public education system and the parental interest in controlling a child's religious upbringing and education. See id. at 213-14. As the district court in this case reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understanding the full import of Yoder, which refined the parental rights announced in Meyer and Pierce, is critical to properly analyze the claims presented in the present case. In Yoder, the Supreme Court, while reaffirming the general notion that parental rights are a protected liberty interest under the due process clause, recognized the \"high responsibility\" and regulatory power of the state in matters of public education. Furthermore, while fundamental religious practices may excuse parents from complying with educational policies, secular objections to such policies are insufficient to avoid compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 699 (emphasis added). The Yoder Court went on to state that \"[a] way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation of education if it is based on purely secular considerations.\" Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as the district court recognized: \"[w]hile the Court employed more than a rational basis standard with reference to the First Amendment free exercise clause, it is clear that the due process interest of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children, standing alone, warranted no more than rational-basis review.\" Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 699. As such, the district court concluded that Meyer, Pierce, and Yoder, taken together, support the argument that a rational-basis review is the appropriate standard in this case. This conclusion is in accord with other circuit courts of appeals that have addressed the issue, pre-Troxel. See Herndon v. Chapel Hill -- Carrboro City Bd. of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721496\"><a href=\"/opinion/721496/aric-herndon-a-minor-by-christiana-and-john-herndon-as-guardians/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 177-79 (4th Cir. 1996); Immediato v.

All parties also agree that the opt-out policy was not enacted to inhibit religion and, in fact, recognize that the statutory provision was enacted to protect the reasonable state interest of fostering the free exercise of religion.

Further, in practice, \"opt-outs\" have been granted to parents who have demonstrated a sincere and consistent objection to the wearing of uniforms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Therefore, we conclude that the Families have not created a genuine issue of material fact that the application of Forney's opt-out policy violates their free exercise rights under the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Next, the principal effect neither advances nor inhibits religion. Its purpose is to enhance the learning environment in the Forney schools, irrespective of the religious faith of a particular student. Finally, the policy does not unnecessarily entangle the School Board with religion. The uniform policy references religion only in the context of exemptions. There is no evidence to suggest that as a result of the uniform policy, the School Board must routinely or even occasionally become involved in religious matters. Less than one hundred exemption requests, out of nearly 2,500 students, were considered by the School Board, and the vast majority concerned secular opt-out requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 708. We agree with the district court's conclusion. None of the families raising the Establishment Clause challenge can point to any religious purpose behind the implementation of the opt-out policy. Nor can these families point to any \"primary effect\" of the opt-out policy that advances a particular religion or that inhibits a religion. On this record, it appears that those families that could demonstrate sincere and consistent rejection of mandatory uniforms were granted exemptions regardless of the particular tenets of their faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Finally, we do not perceive an intolerable risk of excessive government entanglement in the requirement that parents demonstrate their consistency and sincerity by explaining the basis of their religious objections to Defendants.

Moreover, Plaintiffs seek remedies, including damages, for injuries which have already occurred. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have established a particularized, imminent or actual injury, for purposes of Article III.</p>\n        <p>See Littlefield, 108 F. Supp. 2d at 688.

These interests surely suffice to give the parties standing to complain.\"). Of course, as will be discussed infra in the text, each subset of the Plaintiffs-Appellants (\"Students,\" \"Parents,\" and the four families with religious objections) has standing only to challenge the particular legal claim for which that subset can demonstrate injury, causation, and redressability.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Regarding the \"coerced speech\" argument, the Students argue that mandatory uniforms convey a particularized message that the school district wishes to express, namely that students have respect for the authority of teachers and administrators, have Forney school and civic pride, and support the school policies. The Students argue that this message is also understood by school officials, students, and the public, which is the exact reason why the Uniform Policy was adopted (or else it would have no rational purpose). The Students also adduced evidence from student depositions that these students did not wish to convey the message intended by Forney. Thus, the Students conclude that mandatory uniforms coerce students to convey a particular message, which Forney wishes them to express, but which they oppose.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> As to the \"prior restraint\" argument, the Students argue that because the Uniform Policy precludes the use of clothing to express any message -- no matter how specific or particularized -- and that school children do wear clothing that sends political, cultural, and social messages, this restriction is a content-based prior restraint on speech.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Defendants contend that this court should review the Uniform Policy under rational-basis scrutiny.

Further, Defendants argue that there is no evidence that other people at school would be likely to understand the students' message of \"individuality.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> In Karr, this court rejected a constitutional challenge to a portion of a public school dress code that regulated the length of hair for boys.

Our analysis simply acknowledges that certain choices of clothing may have sufficient communicative content to qualify as First Amendment activity.</p>\n        <p>Canady, 240 F.3d at 441 n.3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> At issue in Canady was only a \"prior restraint\"-type argument. However, the assumption that student clothing, and thus the Uniform Policy, implicates expressive conduct also applies to the \"coerced speech\" challenge. In fact, as discussed infra in the text, the requirement that all students wear a certain type of uniform in order to further a certain particularized message of the school district is arguably a stronger justification to find potential expressive conduct and, thus, to apply Canady and O'Brien. The Students have set forth affidavits from Forney officials that the Uniform Policy was intended to express a particular institutional image. In deposition testimony, Forney school officials stated that the purpose of the uniform was, inter alia, to convey respect for \"the values of the Forney schools\" and the \"City of Forney.\" Thus, because Forney implemented the Uniform Policy with the intention of conveying that message, we find it permissible to assume that the expression involved was intentional and particularized and, thus, follow the logic of Canady in evaluating the coerced speech claim.

Each family has alleged that the opt-out policy, by requiring them to explain, defend, and conform their religious practices in an effort not to have their children disciplined or expelled from school, thereby infringes on their right to freely exercise their religious beliefs. Due to the opt-out policy, the McLaren/Johnson family removed Natalie from the Forney school district, rather than be subject to what they allege was a violation of their First Amendment rights. The Penn/Anderson family and the Tapleys refused to participate in the opt-out questionnaire, claiming that the procedures themselves were violative of their religious freedom. The Lowerys were granted a religious exemption, but because the policy requires them to re-apply every year, they claim that the policy threatens a future injury.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> See Cantwell v.

The \"hybrid-rights\" argument is based on the Supreme Court's language in Smith, which recognized that a heightened standard of review may be required when a Free Exercise Clause claim is combined with another constitutional protection such as free expression or parental rights. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 881 (\"The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections.\").

For example, the Lowerys initially refused to fill out the questionnaire. On appeal to the Board of Trustees, however, the Lowerys were granted an exemption based on their stated belief that their Native American ancestry combined with their Catholic beliefs deriving from their interpretation of the \"Vatican II\" proscribed the wearing of uniforms.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> For example, Mr. and Mrs. J.M. stated in response to an opt-out request for Judy M., a Forney student, that Mr. M.'s \"negative personal experience\" with uniforms in Catholic school created a sincere belief that Judy M. should not wear a uniform. Further, they answered \"no\" to all relevant questions regarding their child's previous wearing of uniforms. The exemption was granted for Judy M. In similar fashion, Mr. O., father of a Forney student Patrick O., indicated that he had pulled his children out of Catholic school, partly because of his objections to uniforms. Mr. O. also responded to the questionnaire with \"no\" to each item. Again, the exemption was granted. In addition, the Lowerys were granted an exemption based on their religious beliefs that combine their Native American ancestry and their Catholic beliefs based on an interpretation of Vatican II.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> \"[T]he concept of injury for standing purposes is particularly elusive in Establishment Clause cases.\" Murray v.

The answer to that question would resolve directly the coerced-speech claim at issue. Obviously, if that which is coerced is not speech, then speech has not been coerced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority correctly acknowledges, as did our court in Canady, that the two-part test from Spence v.

Canady explains the application of that test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amendment into play, we [must] ask[] whether '[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.'\" When assessing the appellants' claim, we look to the particular activity, combined with the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">240 F.3d at 440 (quoting Texas v.

Unfortunately, the majority, as did the Canady court, fails to adequately apply Spence to determine whether a school uniform specifically, as opposed to clothing generally, can constitute expression. Instead, as was done in Canady, the majority assumes for purposes of this appeal that the wearing of the uniform at issue constitutes expressive conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants (collectively, Students) assert that, for cases of coerced speech, the two-part Spence test was abrogated by Hurley v.

They rely on the Court's statement that \"a narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a 'particularized message,' would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock, music of Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll\". Id. at 569 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, where speech is pure, a particularized message has never been required; pure speech is entitled to \"comprehensive protection under the First Amendment\".

The Spence test, on the other hand, was established to address speech that is less than pure: namely, \"expression of an idea through activity\". Spence, 418 U.S. at 411.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That wearing a school uniform is not pure speech is supported by Tinker, which involved students being suspended for wearing black armbands to school to protest the conflict in Vietnam. In distinguishing the armband-suspension from other clothing-related regulations, the Court explained: \"The problem posed by the present case does not relate to regulation of the length of skirts or the type of clothing, to hair style, or deportment.... Our problem involves direct, primary First Amendment rights akin to 'pure speech'\". Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507-08. Accordingly, for determining what -- if any -- expressive content there is in wearing the school uniform at issue, we must follow Canady's instruction and engage in the two-part Spence analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Students have proffered some evidence that the Forney Independent School District (FISD) intended to convey a message in adopting the uniform policy -- namely, pride in and respect for the values of FISD and its schools -- I question whether such a message is sufficiently particularized as to satisfy Spence. But, even if FISD did intend that message, I doubt there is any likelihood whatsoever, no less the \"great likelihood\" required by Spence, that such a message would be understood by anyone who happens to see students' blue or khaki trousers (or skirt) and solid-colored shirt. When worn in the factual context and environment in which students are required to wear the uniform -- that is, school -- the uniform conveys at most the following message: that the wearer is a student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly I would hold that, as a matter of law, the wearing of a school uniform devoid of any logo, symbol, or motto -- like the wearing of long hair that was at issue in this court's en banc decision in Karr v. Schmidt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"303553\"><a href=\"/opinion/303553/chesley-karr-a-minor-individually-and-john-r-karr-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1972)(en banc), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></span> (1972) -- does not involve \"sufficient communicative content\" to qualify as expression for First Amendment purposes. Consequently, the requirement to wear such a uniform cannot constitute coerced speech. As the Supreme Court implied in Hurley, where the disfavored message is \"difficult to identify\", there is no risk that the allegedly coerced party is forced \"to propound a particular point of view\". Hurley, 515 U.S. at 574-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, deciding that the wearing of such a school uniform is not expressive conduct alleviates the need to examine the coercion claim under the four-part O'Brien test regarding content-neutral restrictions on expressive conduct. See United States v. O'Brien, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 377 (1968). Indeed, I question whether O'Brien applies to school uniform cases. See, e.g., Phoenix Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1179639\"><a href=\"/opinion/1179639/phoenix-elem-sch-dist-no-1-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span> (Ariz. Ct. App. 1997) (school uniform policy is a content-neutral regulation of the medium, not the message; accordingly, nonpublic forum analysis is the appropriate test); see also Canady, 240 F.3d at 443 (noting the similarity of O'Brien to traditional time, place, manner analysis). But that question is best left for another day. Because coercion to wear the uniform at issue is not coercion to speak, there is no need to apply any degree of heightened scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My conclusion that the wearing of the school uniform at issue is not expressive does not, of course, dictate a result with regard to the Students' other First Amendment claim: restraint on free expression. For even if the uniform is not imbued with expressive value, the uniform policy still precludes the Students from wearing clothing of their choice that may be expressive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing this second claim, the majority again follows the lead of the Canady court in assuming that the uniform policy implicates expressive clothing choices. Accordingly, the majority proceeds with the O'Brien analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"certain choices of clothing may have sufficient communicative content to qualify as First Amendment activity\", Canady, 240 F.3d at 441 n.3, the present record contains only vague depictions of messages the Students supposedly intend to convey through clothing choice. The deposition testimony of one Student is typical:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I mean, I don't like them [school uniforms]. I don't like that we have to wear the same thing every day. It's a routine that I don't like to be in. I don't like to be told what to wear. I would rather wear something that expresses who I am.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, the various \"messages\" proffered by Students in their depositions may be loosely grouped around the concept of individuality. But, I cannot agree -- nor will I assume -- that such a message satisfies the two-part Spence test for discerning expressive conduct. Because the Students have failed to articulate a particularized message likely to be understood by anyone, I would not examine their free expression challenge under the O'Brien test as the majority does. Nor would I apply any degree of heightened scrutiny. Instead, I would ask simply \"whether the regulation is reasonably intended to accomplish a constitutionally permissible state objective\". Karr, 460 F.2d at 616. I conclude it is.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he [Supreme] Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools\". Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507 (emphasis added). In accordance with state law, and in response to a perceived need, FISD has prescribed and controlled the wearing of uniforms in its schools through a uniform policy that is consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards. We should address this issue head-on.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
