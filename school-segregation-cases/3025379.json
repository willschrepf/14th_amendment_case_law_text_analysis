Crawford\n\nDECISION\n\n        {¶1} Plaintiff, IPS Electric Services, LLC (IPS), brought this action against\nDefendant, University of Toledo (UT or the Owner), alleging breach of contract and\nunjust enrichment. The issues of liability and damages were not bifurcated and the\ncase proceeded to trial on both issues.1\n        {¶2} On September 19, 2012, UT contracted with Henning Electrical Services,\nLLC (Henning), for the electrical trades work on a public improvement project known as\nthe Medical Mall Phase II Project (project).                  The project consisted of an addition\nconnecting two existing portions of UT hospital and a remodel of existing hospital\nspace. At some point after the contract was signed, Henning changed its corporate\nname to IPS. On September 19, 2012, UT issued a Notice to Proceed providing that\nIPS had 148 consecutive calendar days, or until February 15, 2013, to fully complete its\nwork on the project. However, when the Notice to Proceed was issued, UT, the project\narchitect The Collaborative, Inc. (The Collaborative), and lead contractor A.Z. Schmina,\nInc., (AZ) were proceeding on the project with a completion date of December 31, 2012.\n As a result, as soon as IPS began work on the project, IPS and the other contractors\n\fwere operating under an informal project schedule with a projected completion date of\nDecember 31, 2012.\n       {¶3} A number of delays impacted the project ultimately affecting the\ncoordination of the work and the completion date of the project.                Throughout the\nduration of the project, IPS corresponded with Christopher Levicki, project manager for\nUT, regarding its issues on the project.2 On October 24, 2012, by way of a letter, IPS\ncomplained to UT regarding several issues that IPS claims were impacting its work on\nthe project. In the letter, IPS claims that its work on the project has been accelerated\nby a schedule dated August 31, 2012, with a completion date of January 11, 2013,\nissued by AZ, and that it “will not be able to meet this accelerated schedule for the price\nquoted on bid day.” Additionally, IPS states that air handling units ordered by UT are\nexpected to arrive three or four weeks late; that there is a four week impact to IPS for\nAZ’s failure to meet its October 18, 2012 date for having the Mall weather tight; that\npredecessor work such as stud walls that should have been completed by September\n5, 2012, are not yet complete; that the ceiling grid in Area A should have been\ncompleted by September 12, 2012, but did not start until October 23, 2012; and, that\nAreas B and C are not available for work as a result of “late demolition and patient\ntraffic.” IPS states that as a result, it will not be able to complete work on the project\nuntil March 12, 2013.\n       {¶4} On December 24, 2012, IPS corresponded with Levicki at UT and Brandon\nAndrzejczak at The Collaborative regarding issues it was having on the project. In the\nletter, IPS states that on August 27, 2012, AZ issued a project schedule with a\ncompletion date of January 2, 2013.          IPS states that it “committed manpower and\nresources to meet the revised January completion date, which included additional costs\nto account for the recognized acceleration.” IPS states that in early September 2012,\nAZ issued a “new” schedule with a completion date of January 2, 2013 representing 43\ndays of “schedule compression” to IPS.           Additionally, IPS identifies several delays\naffecting its work on the project. Those delays include late delivery of air handling\nunits; late dry-in for the Mall; and slow responses to requests for information delaying\noverhead duct work and installation of wall studs. IPS states that wall stud delays and\nlate ceiling grid installation have impacted its work on the project causing delays of six\n\n\n       1 The   parties’ February 3, 2015 and February 4, 2015 motions for leave to exceed the page\nlimitation are GRANTED.\n\for seven weeks. Additionally, IPS complains of delays as a result of patient traffic\ncorridors through the project site. As a result, IPS states that it will need additional\nfunding to meet the completion date of February 14, 2013.\n       {¶5} On January 22, 2013, IPS sent correspondence to both Levicki and\nAndrzejczak regarding “impacts and claims” affecting the project. IPS estimates that\nlabor costs “associated with schedule compression from 8/12/12 to 10/28/12 is\n$50,000” due to an accelerated project completion date of January 2, 2013. IPS states\nthat the “cost associated with disruptions to our performance as we described in our\nearlier correspondence is $110,000, presuming a project completion date of March 15,\n2013.” Additionally, IPS states that the missed dry-in date and delays in moving the\ntemporary patient corridors have impacted IPS in the amount of $20,000 in General\nConditions.\n       {¶6} On February 21, 2013, IPS again sent correspondence to both Levicki and\nAndrzejczak containing “back-up information as a detailed justification to that January\n22, 2013 letter.” In the letter, IPS states that “there is an additional $20,000 of general\nconditions cost due to the extended duration of this project * * * as well as $23,340 in\nnet margin and $30,443 in overhead * * *.” Attached to the letter is a document entitled\nAddendum A which identifies five categories of delays that affected IPS’s work on the\nproject:\n            (1) Acceleration Area “A”--$50,000 for 778 man-hours for two\n       additional people from September 9, 2012 to November 11, 2012, to meet\n       the accelerated project completion date of December 31, 2012;\n\n             (2) Delays Area “B”--$46,296 for 720 man-hours for two additional\n       people from November 4, 2012 to January 6, 2013, as a result of delayed\n       access to the north portion of Area B, a two month delay in the demolition\n       of existing corridors, a week-long project shut down for a healthcare\n       related inspection (CMS inspection), and AZ’s alleged failure to schedule\n       two week look-ahead meetings from the beginning of the project;\n             (3) Delays Area “A”--$20,576 for 320 man-hours for two additional\n       people from February 10, 2013 to March 10, 2013, as a result of schedule\n       changes regarding patient corridor from stair #1, slab removal west end of\n       mall, and removal of the temporary walkway on January 18th;\n\n            (4) Delay Area, Mall--$20,576 for 320 man-hours for one additional\n       person from January 13, 2013 to March 10, 2013, as a result of missed\n       milestone dates for overhead steel completion, slab removal throughout\n\n\n       2Each   of the letters identified in the decision was admitted as Plaintiff’s Exhibit D.\n\f       mall area, building enclosure, and removal of existing temporary\n       enclosure;\n\n              (5) Pharmacy Delay, Area “C”--$22,569 for 351 man-hours for\n       three additional people from February 17, 2013 through March 10, 2013\n       as a result of mall delays, delayed start date for stud framing, delayed\n       MEP finishes start date, and delayed removal/relocation of the patient\n       traffic corridors.\n\n       {¶7} IPS substantially completed its work on the project by April 1, 2013. On\nApril 25, 2013, IPS submitted its “Certified Claim” to Levicki for the “cumulative impact\nof the University of Toledo and its agents for the work that IPS performed” on the\nproject. In the letter, IPS states that the Lead Contractor failed to engage a Schedule\nManager pursuant to Article 4.2.3 of the contract documents.              IPS notes that a\nschedule was not agreed upon until January 2013, and that as a result of the problems\nwith the project schedule, IPS incurred delays and extra costs.            Additionally, IPS\nidentified three areas of cost impact as a result of the delays on the project:\n           (1) $50,000 claim for schedule compression as “documented in our\n       February 21, 2013 letter, the areas where work was affected occurred in\n       Area A between September 9, 2012 and November 11, 2012”;\n\n            (2) $210,000 for disruptions of performance as “documented in our\n       February 21, 2013 letter, the areas where work was affected occurred in\n       Areas A, B, C, (Pharmacy) and the Mall for the periods of time noted in\n       the Addendum to that letter. Since the date of the letter, there has been\n       an additional identifiable damage totally an approximate $100,000”;\n\n             (3) $20,000 for additional General Conditions as documented in\n       “letters of notice to the University of Toledo as Project Owner on October\n       24, 2012, December 24, 2012, January 22, 2013 and February 21, 2013\n       and in this certified claims letter. There is an additional claim for General\n       Conditions because we are now substantially complete and can now fully\n       quantify the GCs. The total amount of General Conditions owed is\n       $70,898.29.”\n\n       {¶8} At trial, IPS asserted claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\nIPS argues that it is entitled to $473,455 in addition to prejudgment interest as a result\nof schedule acceleration, delay, and disruption throughout the project. UT argues that\nIPS failed to timely notify, substantiate, and certify its claims, thus waiving its claims and\nfailing to exhaust its administrative remedies.          Waiver and failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies are affirmative defenses, upon which UT bears the burden of\n\fproof. Cleveland Constr., Inc. v. Kent State Univ., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 09AP-822,\n2010-Ohio-2906, ¶ 48.\n       {¶9} There is no dispute that a written contract governs the relationship between\nthe parties. Accordingly, IPS’s claim for unjust enrichment is dismissed. Cent. Allied\nEnts., Inc., v. Adjutant General’s Dept., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP-701,\n2011-Ohio-4920, ¶ 39.\n       {¶10} Contract interpretation is a matter of law for the court. City of St. Marys v.\nAuglaize Cty. Bd. of Commrs., 115 Ohio St.3d 387, 2007-Ohio-5026, ¶ 38. When\ninterpreting a contract, a court’s principal objective is to ascertain and give effect to the\nintent of the parties. Hamilton Ins. Servs., Inc. v. Nationwide Ins. Cos., 86 Ohio St.3d\n270, 273 (1999). “The intent of the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the\nlanguage they chose to employ in the agreement.” Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co., 31 Ohio\nSt.3d 130 (1987), paragraph one of the syllabus. In determining the parties’ intent, a\ncourt must read the contract as a whole and give effect, if possible, to every part of the\ncontract.   Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities\nAuth., 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 361-362 (1997). “[W]here the terms in an existing contract\nare clear and unambiguous, this court cannot in effect create a new contract by finding\nan intent not expressed in the clear language employed by the parties.” Alexander v.\nBuckeye Pipe Line Co., 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 246 (1978).\n       {¶11} “[W]hen a contract has an express provision governing a dispute, that\nprovision will be applied; the court will not rewrite the contract to achieve a more\nequitable result.” Dugan & Meyers Constr. Co. v. Ohio Dept. of Admin. Servs., 113\nOhio St.3d 226, 2007-Ohio-1687, ¶ 39; see also Cleveland Constr., Inc., supra.\n       {¶12} Article 8 of the General Conditions entitled Dispute Resolution details the\nprocedure for submitting a claim, in part as follows:\n       {¶13} “8.1 Initiation of a Claim\n       {¶14} “8.1.1 Every claim shall accrue upon the date of occurrence of the event\ngiving rise to the claim.\n       {¶15} “8.1.2 Except as provided under paragraph 2.15, the Contractor shall\ninitiate every claim by giving written notice of the claim to the A/E and the Contracting\nAuthority within 10 days after occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim[.]\n       {¶16} “ * * *.\n\f         {¶17} “8.1.4 The Contractor’s failure to initiate a claim as and when required\nunder this paragraph 8.1 shall constitute the Contractor’s irrevocable waiver of the\nclaim.\n         {¶18} “8.2 Substantiation of Claims\n         {¶19} “8.2.1 Within 30 days after the initiation of a Claim, the Contractor shall\nsubmit 4 copies of all information and statements required to substantiate a claim as\nprovided in this Article 8 and all other information which the Contractor believes\nsubstantiates the claim. * * *.\n         {¶20} “* * *.\n         {¶21} “8.2.4 The Contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this\nparagraph 8.2 shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of any related claim.\n         {¶22} “* * *.\n         {¶23} “8.5 Certification of the Claim\n         {¶24} “8.5.1 The Contractor shall certify each claim within 30 days after initiating\nthe claim under paragraph 8.1 or before Contract Completion, whichever is earlier, by\nproviding the notarized certification specified in subparagraph 8.5.1.1, signed and dated\nby the Contractor:\n         {¶25} “8.5.1.1 ‘The undersigned Contractor certifies that the claim is made in\ngood faith; that the supporting data is accurate and complete to the best of the\nContractor’s knowledge and belief; that the amount requested is fair, reasonable, and\nnecessary adjustment for which the Contractor believes the State is liable; and that the\nundersigned is duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.’\n         {¶26} “ * * *.\n         {¶27} “8.5.3 The Contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this\nparagraph 8.5 shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of any related claim.”\n         {¶28} IPS argues that “[o]nly after final completion might IPS know the true\nnature of damages, whether its earlier notices resulted in the University mitigating or\nexacerbating damages, or whether individual delays or impacts compounded with\nothers. Only at the end of the Project, after the University executed its bulletins in May\nand June, could IPS know that the University failed to take remedial measures, and\nthen calculate IPS’s total impact damages[.]”           IPS’s post-trial brief, pgs. 13-14.\nHowever, Article 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 clearly and unambiguously provide that IPS shall\ninitiate a claim by providing written notice of a claim within 10 days after the occurrence\n\fof the event giving rise to the claim, rather than when a contractor is able to precisely\ncalculate its damages at the conclusion of the project. See Cleveland Constr., Inc.,\nsupra; Stanley Miller Constr. Co. v. Ohio Sch. Facilities Commission, 10th Dist. Franklin\nNos. 10AP-298, 10AP-299, 10AP-432, 10AP-433, 2010-Ohio-6397. Additionally, after\ninitiation of a claim, pursuant to Article 8.2 and 8.5, a contractor shall substantiate and\ncertify its claim within 30 days after initiation of a claim.\n       {¶29} Upon review of the evidence, the Court finds that IPS failed to timely\ninitiate its claims within 10 days after the occurrence of the events giving rise to the\nclaims. IPS’s April 25, 2013 Certified Claim sets forth three separate claims for which\nit seeks to recover damages for breach of contract.             First, IPS claims $50,000 in\nschedule compression that affected its work in Area A between September 9, 2012 and\nNovember 11, 2012. Second, IPS claims $210,000 for disruptions of performance that\naffected its work in Areas A, B, C (Pharmacy) and the Mall for the time periods outlined\nin Addendum A to its February 21, 2013 letter.            The time periods identified in the\nAddendum are as follows: Area A – February 10, 2013 to March 10, 2013; Area B –\nNovember 4, 2012 to January 6, 2013; Area C – February 17, 2013 to March 10, 2013;\nand the Mall – January 13, 2013 through March 10, 2013. Third, IPS claims $20,000\nfor additional General Conditions as documented in the letters dated October 24, 2012,\nDecember 24, 2012, January 22, 2013, and February 21, 2013, and April 25, 2013.\n       {¶30} There is no doubt that the April 25, 2013 Certified Claim letter cannot form\nthe basis upon which IPS initiated its claims inasmuch as such a letter was not\nsubmitted within 10 days after the occurrence of the events giving rise to the claims as\noutlined in IPS’s own Certified Claim letter. All of the events that give rise to the claims\nidentified in the Certified Claim letter occurred at the latest on or before March 10,\n2013. IPS substantially completed its work on the project by April 1, 2013 but did not\nsubmit written notice of a claim until April 25, 2013 when it submitted its Certified Claim.\n Accordingly, the Court finds that IPS did not timely initiate its claims pursuant to Article\n8.1.1 and 8.1.2.\n       {¶31} Even if the Court determined that IPS timely initiated its claims as outlined\nin the October 24, 2012, December 24, 2012, January 22, 2013, and February 21, 2013\nletters, IPS did not substantiate or certify its claims within 30 days after initiation of a\nclaim as required by Article 8.2. and 8.5. Regardless of which letter forms the basis for\ninitiation of a claim, the Court can only conclude that the April 25, 2013 Certified Claim\n\fletter was submitted more than 30 days after initiation of a claim. Additionally, the\nOctober 24, 2012, December 24, 2012, January 22, 2013, and February 21, 2013\nletters do not meet the requirements outlined in Article 8.2.2 for substantiation of a\nclaim or the requirements of Article 8.5.1 for certification of a claim.3 As stated in the\nGeneral Conditions, failure to comply with the requirements of Article 8 shall constitute\nan irrevocable waiver of any related claim.\n        {¶32} IPS argues that UT repeatedly communicated that it would not entertain\nIPS’s claims and that IPS is therefore excused from pursuing administrative remedies\ninasmuch as doing so would be futile or a vain act. R.C. 153.12(B) provides in relevant\npart: “If a dispute arises between the state and a contractor concerning the terms of a\npublic improvement contract let by the state or concerning a breach of the contract, and\nafter the administrative remedies provided for in such a contract * * * are exhausted, the\ncontractor may bring an action to the court of claims in accordance with Chapter 2743\nof the Revised Code.”           “R.C. 153.12(B) presents a rare instance where a statute\nrequires a plaintiff to exhaust its administrative remedies before bringing suit. Unlike\nthe judicially-created exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine, R.C. 153.12(B)\ndoes not include any exceptions.”                  Cleveland Constr., Inc., supra, at ¶ 37.\nConsequently, IPS cannot avoid the procedures identified in Article 8 “due to a high\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome.” Id. at ¶ 42.\n        {¶33} Finally, IPS argues that UT waived strict compliance with the dispute\nresolution procedure outlined in Article 8. However, the evidence establishes that UT\ninsisted on strict compliance with the notice and substantiation provisions identified in\nArticle 8.

Crawford\n\nDECISION\n\n        {¶1} Plaintiff, IPS Electric Services, LLC (IPS), brought this action against\nDefendant, University of Toledo (UT or the Owner), alleging breach of contract and\nunjust enrichment. The issues of liability and damages were not bifurcated and the\ncase proceeded to trial on both issues.1\n        {¶2} On September 19, 2012, UT contracted with Henning Electrical Services,\nLLC (Henning), for the electrical trades work on a public improvement project known as\nthe Medical Mall Phase II Project (project).                  The project consisted of an addition\nconnecting two existing portions of UT hospital and a remodel of existing hospital\nspace. At some point after the contract was signed, Henning changed its corporate\nname to IPS. On September 19, 2012, UT issued a Notice to Proceed providing that\nIPS had 148 consecutive calendar days, or until February 15, 2013, to fully complete its\nwork on the project. However, when the Notice to Proceed was issued, UT, the project\narchitect The Collaborative, Inc. (The Collaborative), and lead contractor A.Z. Schmina,\nInc., (AZ) were proceeding on the project with a completion date of December 31, 2012.\n As a result, as soon as IPS began work on the project, IPS and the other contractors\n\fwere operating under an informal project schedule with a projected completion date of\nDecember 31, 2012.\n       {¶3} A number of delays impacted the project ultimately affecting the\ncoordination of the work and the completion date of the project.                Throughout the\nduration of the project, IPS corresponded with Christopher Levicki, project manager for\nUT, regarding its issues on the project.2 On October 24, 2012, by way of a letter, IPS\ncomplained to UT regarding several issues that IPS claims were impacting its work on\nthe project. In the letter, IPS claims that its work on the project has been accelerated\nby a schedule dated August 31, 2012, with a completion date of January 11, 2013,\nissued by AZ, and that it “will not be able to meet this accelerated schedule for the price\nquoted on bid day.” Additionally, IPS states that air handling units ordered by UT are\nexpected to arrive three or four weeks late; that there is a four week impact to IPS for\nAZ’s failure to meet its October 18, 2012 date for having the Mall weather tight; that\npredecessor work such as stud walls that should have been completed by September\n5, 2012, are not yet complete; that the ceiling grid in Area A should have been\ncompleted by September 12, 2012, but did not start until October 23, 2012; and, that\nAreas B and C are not available for work as a result of “late demolition and patient\ntraffic.” IPS states that as a result, it will not be able to complete work on the project\nuntil March 12, 2013.\n       {¶4} On December 24, 2012, IPS corresponded with Levicki at UT and Brandon\nAndrzejczak at The Collaborative regarding issues it was having on the project. In the\nletter, IPS states that on August 27, 2012, AZ issued a project schedule with a\ncompletion date of January 2, 2013.          IPS states that it “committed manpower and\nresources to meet the revised January completion date, which included additional costs\nto account for the recognized acceleration.” IPS states that in early September 2012,\nAZ issued a “new” schedule with a completion date of January 2, 2013 representing 43\ndays of “schedule compression” to IPS.           Additionally, IPS identifies several delays\naffecting its work on the project. Those delays include late delivery of air handling\nunits; late dry-in for the Mall; and slow responses to requests for information delaying\noverhead duct work and installation of wall studs. IPS states that wall stud delays and\nlate ceiling grid installation have impacted its work on the project causing delays of six\n\n\n       1 The   parties’ February 3, 2015 and February 4, 2015 motions for leave to exceed the page\nlimitation are GRANTED.\n\for seven weeks. Additionally, IPS complains of delays as a result of patient traffic\ncorridors through the project site. As a result, IPS states that it will need additional\nfunding to meet the completion date of February 14, 2013.\n       {¶5} On January 22, 2013, IPS sent correspondence to both Levicki and\nAndrzejczak regarding “impacts and claims” affecting the project. IPS estimates that\nlabor costs “associated with schedule compression from 8/12/12 to 10/28/12 is\n$50,000” due to an accelerated project completion date of January 2, 2013. IPS states\nthat the “cost associated with disruptions to our performance as we described in our\nearlier correspondence is $110,000, presuming a project completion date of March 15,\n2013.” Additionally, IPS states that the missed dry-in date and delays in moving the\ntemporary patient corridors have impacted IPS in the amount of $20,000 in General\nConditions.\n       {¶6} On February 21, 2013, IPS again sent correspondence to both Levicki and\nAndrzejczak containing “back-up information as a detailed justification to that January\n22, 2013 letter.” In the letter, IPS states that “there is an additional $20,000 of general\nconditions cost due to the extended duration of this project * * * as well as $23,340 in\nnet margin and $30,443 in overhead * * *.” Attached to the letter is a document entitled\nAddendum A which identifies five categories of delays that affected IPS’s work on the\nproject:\n            (1) Acceleration Area “A”--$50,000 for 778 man-hours for two\n       additional people from September 9, 2012 to November 11, 2012, to meet\n       the accelerated project completion date of December 31, 2012;\n\n             (2) Delays Area “B”--$46,296 for 720 man-hours for two additional\n       people from November 4, 2012 to January 6, 2013, as a result of delayed\n       access to the north portion of Area B, a two month delay in the demolition\n       of existing corridors, a week-long project shut down for a healthcare\n       related inspection (CMS inspection), and AZ’s alleged failure to schedule\n       two week look-ahead meetings from the beginning of the project;\n             (3) Delays Area “A”--$20,576 for 320 man-hours for two additional\n       people from February 10, 2013 to March 10, 2013, as a result of schedule\n       changes regarding patient corridor from stair #1, slab removal west end of\n       mall, and removal of the temporary walkway on January 18th;\n\n            (4) Delay Area, Mall--$20,576 for 320 man-hours for one additional\n       person from January 13, 2013 to March 10, 2013, as a result of missed\n       milestone dates for overhead steel completion, slab removal throughout\n\n\n       2Each   of the letters identified in the decision was admitted as Plaintiff’s Exhibit D.\n\f       mall area, building enclosure, and removal of existing temporary\n       enclosure;\n\n              (5) Pharmacy Delay, Area “C”--$22,569 for 351 man-hours for\n       three additional people from February 17, 2013 through March 10, 2013\n       as a result of mall delays, delayed start date for stud framing, delayed\n       MEP finishes start date, and delayed removal/relocation of the patient\n       traffic corridors.\n\n       {¶7} IPS substantially completed its work on the project by April 1, 2013. On\nApril 25, 2013, IPS submitted its “Certified Claim” to Levicki for the “cumulative impact\nof the University of Toledo and its agents for the work that IPS performed” on the\nproject. In the letter, IPS states that the Lead Contractor failed to engage a Schedule\nManager pursuant to Article 4.2.3 of the contract documents.              IPS notes that a\nschedule was not agreed upon until January 2013, and that as a result of the problems\nwith the project schedule, IPS incurred delays and extra costs.            Additionally, IPS\nidentified three areas of cost impact as a result of the delays on the project:\n           (1) $50,000 claim for schedule compression as “documented in our\n       February 21, 2013 letter, the areas where work was affected occurred in\n       Area A between September 9, 2012 and November 11, 2012”;\n\n            (2) $210,000 for disruptions of performance as “documented in our\n       February 21, 2013 letter, the areas where work was affected occurred in\n       Areas A, B, C, (Pharmacy) and the Mall for the periods of time noted in\n       the Addendum to that letter. Since the date of the letter, there has been\n       an additional identifiable damage totally an approximate $100,000”;\n\n             (3) $20,000 for additional General Conditions as documented in\n       “letters of notice to the University of Toledo as Project Owner on October\n       24, 2012, December 24, 2012, January 22, 2013 and February 21, 2013\n       and in this certified claims letter. There is an additional claim for General\n       Conditions because we are now substantially complete and can now fully\n       quantify the GCs. The total amount of General Conditions owed is\n       $70,898.29.”\n\n       {¶8} At trial, IPS asserted claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\nIPS argues that it is entitled to $473,455 in addition to prejudgment interest as a result\nof schedule acceleration, delay, and disruption throughout the project. UT argues that\nIPS failed to timely notify, substantiate, and certify its claims, thus waiving its claims and\nfailing to exhaust its administrative remedies.          Waiver and failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies are affirmative defenses, upon which UT bears the burden of\n\fproof. Cleveland Constr., Inc. v. Kent State Univ., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 09AP-822,\n2010-Ohio-2906, ¶ 48.\n       {¶9} There is no dispute that a written contract governs the relationship between\nthe parties. Accordingly, IPS’s claim for unjust enrichment is dismissed. Cent. Allied\nEnts., Inc., v. Adjutant General’s Dept., 10th Dist.

Only at the end of the Project, after the University executed its bulletins in May\nand June, could IPS know that the University failed to take remedial measures, and\nthen calculate IPS’s total impact damages[.]”           IPS’s post-trial brief, pgs. 13-14.\nHowever, Article 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 clearly and unambiguously provide that IPS shall\ninitiate a claim by providing written notice of a claim within 10 days after the occurrence\n\fof the event giving rise to the claim, rather than when a contractor is able to precisely\ncalculate its damages at the conclusion of the project. See Cleveland Constr., Inc.,\nsupra; Stanley Miller Constr. Co. v. Ohio Sch. Facilities Commission, 10th Dist. Franklin\nNos. 10AP-298, 10AP-299, 10AP-432, 10AP-433, 2010-Ohio-6397. Additionally, after\ninitiation of a claim, pursuant to Article 8.2 and 8.5, a contractor shall substantiate and\ncertify its claim within 30 days after initiation of a claim.\n       {¶29} Upon review of the evidence, the Court finds that IPS failed to timely\ninitiate its claims within 10 days after the occurrence of the events giving rise to the\nclaims. IPS’s April 25, 2013 Certified Claim sets forth three separate claims for which\nit seeks to recover damages for breach of contract.             First, IPS claims $50,000 in\nschedule compression that affected its work in Area A between September 9, 2012 and\nNovember 11, 2012. Second, IPS claims $210,000 for disruptions of performance that\naffected its work in Areas A, B, C (Pharmacy) and the Mall for the time periods outlined\nin Addendum A to its February 21, 2013 letter.            The time periods identified in the\nAddendum are as follows: Area A – February 10, 2013 to March 10, 2013; Area B –\nNovember 4, 2012 to January 6, 2013; Area C – February 17, 2013 to March 10, 2013;\nand the Mall – January 13, 2013 through March 10, 2013. Third, IPS claims $20,000\nfor additional General Conditions as documented in the letters dated October 24, 2012,\nDecember 24, 2012, January 22, 2013, and February 21, 2013, and April 25, 2013.\n       {¶30} There is no doubt that the April 25, 2013 Certified Claim letter cannot form\nthe basis upon which IPS initiated its claims inasmuch as such a letter was not\nsubmitted within 10 days after the occurrence of the events giving rise to the claims as\noutlined in IPS’s own Certified Claim letter. All of the events that give rise to the claims\nidentified in the Certified Claim letter occurred at the latest on or before March 10,\n2013. IPS substantially completed its work on the project by April 1, 2013 but did not\nsubmit written notice of a claim until April 25, 2013 when it submitted its Certified Claim.\n Accordingly, the Court finds that IPS did not timely initiate its claims pursuant to Article\n8.1.1 and 8.1.2.\n       {¶31} Even if the Court determined that IPS timely initiated its claims as outlined\nin the October 24, 2012, December 24, 2012, January 22, 2013, and February 21, 2013\nletters, IPS did not substantiate or certify its claims within 30 days after initiation of a\nclaim as required by Article 8.2. and 8.5. Regardless of which letter forms the basis for\ninitiation of a claim, the Court can only conclude that the April 25, 2013 Certified Claim\n\fletter was submitted more than 30 days after initiation of a claim. Additionally, the\nOctober 24, 2012, December 24, 2012, January 22, 2013, and February 21, 2013\nletters do not meet the requirements outlined in Article 8.2.2 for substantiation of a\nclaim or the requirements of Article 8.5.1 for certification of a claim.3 As stated in the\nGeneral Conditions, failure to comply with the requirements of Article 8 shall constitute\nan irrevocable waiver of any related claim.\n        {¶32} IPS argues that UT repeatedly communicated that it would not entertain\nIPS’s claims and that IPS is therefore excused from pursuing administrative remedies\ninasmuch as doing so would be futile or a vain act. R.C. 153.12(B) provides in relevant\npart: “If a dispute arises between the state and a contractor concerning the terms of a\npublic improvement contract let by the state or concerning a breach of the contract, and\nafter the administrative remedies provided for in such a contract * * * are exhausted, the\ncontractor may bring an action to the court of claims in accordance with Chapter 2743\nof the Revised Code.”           “R.C. 153.12(B) presents a rare instance where a statute\nrequires a plaintiff to exhaust its administrative remedies before bringing suit. Unlike\nthe judicially-created exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine, R.C. 153.12(B)\ndoes not include any exceptions.”                  Cleveland Constr., Inc., supra, at ¶ 37.\nConsequently, IPS cannot avoid the procedures identified in Article 8 “due to a high\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome.” Id. at ¶ 42.\n        {¶33} Finally, IPS argues that UT waived strict compliance with the dispute\nresolution procedure outlined in Article 8. However, the evidence establishes that UT\ninsisted on strict compliance with the notice and substantiation provisions identified in\nArticle 8. Defendant’s Exhibit 24.\n\n\n        3 “8.2.2  The Contractor shall substantiate all of its claims by providing the following minimum\ninformation:\n         “8.2.2.1 A narrative of the circumstances, which gave rise to the claim, including, without\nlimitation, the start date of the event or events and the actual, or anticipated finish date;\n         “8.2.2.2 Detailed identification of the Work (e.g., activity codes from the Construction Progress\nSchedule) affected by the event giving rise to the claim;\n         “8.2.2.3 Copies of the Lead Contractor’s daily log (subparagraph 4.2.9) for each day of impact;\n         “8.2.2.4 Copies of relevant correspondence and other information regarding or supporting\nContractor entitlement.\n         “8.2.2.5 Copies of the Contractor’s most recent income statement, including segregated general\nand administrative expenses for the most recent reporting period, and for the period of the Contact, if\navailable, and similar information for any Subcontractor claim included;\n         “8.2.2.6 The notarized certification described under subparagraph 8.5.1.1;\n         “8.2.3 The Contractor shall submit a fully executed Contractor Claim Submission Checklist,\nsignifying compliance with all of the requirements listed in subparagraph 8.2.2 with each copy of the claim.\n         “8.2.4 The Contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph 8.2 shall\n\f        {¶34} While IPS has proved that some of UT’s actions, as outlined in its April 25,\n2013 Certified Claim letter constituted a breach of its contract with UT, UT has proved\nby a preponderance of the evidence that IPS failed to comply with the dispute\nresolution procedure set forth in the contract. IPS’s January 16, 2015 motion for leave\nto amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence is DENIED as moot.4 Accordingly,\nthe Court shall render judgment in favor of UT.\n\n\n\n                                                _____________________________________\n                                                DALE A.
