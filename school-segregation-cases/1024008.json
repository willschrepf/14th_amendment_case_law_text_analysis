Because we conclude that the lower\ncourt was without subject matter jurisdiction, we affirm the magistrate judge’s\ndismissal of the action, but vacate the final order of dismissal and remand to the\ndistrict court for the entry of a judgment of dismissal of all claims without\nprejudice.\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      As punishment for an August 2001 disciplinary infraction committed at\na medium security federal correctional complex in Beaumont, Texas, Plaintiff-\nAppellant Edward Ashford (“Ashford”) was transferred to the United States\nPenitentiary in Beaumont (“USP-Beaumont”), a high security institution.\nAshford was concerned that this move would place him in the same facility as\ncertain prisoners from the Washington, D.C. area. Although Ashford had been\ninvolved in incidents with several prisoners from that area (due to his prior\ncooperation with law enforcement and his father’s service as a corrections officer\nin the Washington, D.C. jail), he was particularly concerned about an inmate\nnamed Kelvin Smith, who had attacked him in 1985 when the two had\npreviously been incarcerated together. Ashford contends that Smith’s attack had\nprompted corrections officers in Washington, D.C. to issue separation orders,\nforbidding the two inmates from being confined in the same prison population.\nAshford’s troubles with Smith followed him throughout the federal system, as\nSmith attempted to orchestrate attacks while Ashford was incarcerated at\nfacilities in Terre Haute, Indiana and Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f   Case: 10-40804   Document: 00511777725      Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-40804\n\n      Ashford contends that, prior to his transfer, he explained his concerns to\nthe warden of the medium security facility in Beaumont, Jonathon Dobre. The\nwarden advised him to contact several different Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nofficials, including Ronald Thompson, Regional Director for the South Central\nRegional Office for the BOP. Ashford wrote these officials to explain that he\nshould not be housed with prisoners from Washington, D.C., including Smith.\nAshford claims that the warden assured him that his safety concerns would be\ninvestigated before his transfer.\n      Shortly thereafter, and before his concerns were investigated, Ashford was\ntransferred to USP-Beaumont. When Ashford arrived at the prison, he was\ninterviewed by Lieutenant Russell Haas. Ashford claims that he provided Haas\nwith details of his history with Smith, and asked whether Smith was housed at\nthe facility. According to Ashford, Haas assured him that Smith was not\nincarcerated at USP-Beaumont. This, however, was not the case, as Smith was\nin fact incarcerated there. Haas, however, claims that Ashford never mentioned\nSmith during the intake interview. Ashford also completed an Intake Screening\nForm upon his arrival, which asked, inter alia, “[d]o you know of any reason that\nyou should not be placed in general population?” He responded, “No.”\n      After the intake interview, Ashford was placed in the general population\nat USP-Beaumont. On November 16, 2001, just two days after his arrival,\nAshford was told by certain inmates to “check in,” meaning that he should enter\nprotective custody due to an impending attack. Approximately six hours later,\nan inmate approached Ashford and purportedly said: “I ain’t got no beef with you\npersonally, right; but [Smith] sent us.” Ashford was then viciously attacked and\nstabbed approximately 13 times. He sustained wounds to his back, head, inner\nleft ear canal, and upper torso. His left lung was punctured. The attack has left\nAshford with both hearing and vision problems.\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f   Case: 10-40804      Document: 00511777725        Page: 4    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                     No. 10-40804\n\n      Ashford subsequently brought suit against the United States and several\nprison officials under the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1346,\nand Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,\n403 U.S. 388 (1971).1 His FTCA claim alleged that the government negligently\nplaced him in the general prison population with Smith and other prisoners from\nWashington, D.C. The parties consented to have a magistrate judge hear and\ndecide the FTCA claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), and the magistrate judge\nheld a Flowers evidentiary hearing.2 After the hearing, the magistrate judge\ndeclined to make credibility determinations, and instead granted the\ngovernment’s summary judgment motion based upon the discretionary function\nexception to the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).\n      Ashford appealed the magistrate judge’s judgment, and a panel of this\ncourt reversed, holding that a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to\nwhether Ashford raised his safety concerns to officials at USP-Beaumont,\nthereby triggering a prison policy that required officials to put Ashford in\nsolitary confinement until an investigation could be conducted. Ashford v. United\nStates, 511 F.3d 501, 505 (5th Cir. 2007). The panel reasoned that this policy\n“constrained the prison officials’ discretion such that if the factual predicate to\nthe policy was met, there was no room for choice in making the decision whether\nto place Ashford in solitary confinement,” and thus the discretionary function\nexception to the FTCA would not apply. Id. The panel then remanded the case\nto the magistrate judge to determine whether in fact this mandatory prison\npolicy was triggered in light of the facts of the case.\n\n\n\n      1\n        Ashford’s Bivens claims against the individual defendants were dismissed, and\nAshford does not appeal this decision. As such, only Ashford’s FTCA claim against the\ngovernment remains.\n      2\n         See Flowers v. Phelps, 956 F.2d 488 (5th Cir.), vacated and superceded in part on\ndenial of reh’g, 964 F.2d 400 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                            4\n\f   Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725      Page: 5    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\n      Upon remand, the magistrate judge entered findings of fact and\nconclusions of law based upon the same Flowers hearing that was held prior to\nthe grant of summary judgment. Instead of addressing the FTCA discretionary\nfunction exception, however, the magistrate judge proceeded to the merits and\nconcluded that the government was not negligent. Ashford now appeals again.\n                         II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      A Flowers hearing “‘amounts to a bench trial replete with credibility\ndeterminations and findings of fact.’” Ashford, 511 F.3d at 504 (quoting McAfee\nv. Martin, 63 F.3d 436, 437 (5th Cir. 1995)). As with any bench trial, “we\nreview . . . findings of fact for clear error; conclusions of law, de novo.” Baldwin\nv. Stalder, 137 F.3d 836, 839 (5th Cir. 1998). “A factual finding is not clearly\nerroneous as long as it is plausible in the light of the record read as a whole.”\nUnited States v. Cluck, 143 F.3d 174, 180 (5th Cir. 1998). A factual finding is\nclearly erroneous where, “‘although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing\ncourt on the entire record is left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been committed.’” Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S.\n564, 573 (1985) (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S.\n364, 395 (1948)).\n                               III. DISCUSSION\n      The FTCA is a limited waiver of the United States’ sovereign immunity\nfrom suit for claims regarding “injury or loss of property, or personal injury or\ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the\nGovernment while acting within the scope of his office or employment.” 28\nU.S.C. § 1346(b)(1). We strictly construe such waivers, resolving all ambiguities\nin favor of the sovereign. See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996). The FTCA’s\ndiscretionary function exception provides that sovereign immunity is not waived\nfor any claim “based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise\nor perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an\n\n                                         5\n\f   Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725       Page: 6    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-40804\n\nemployee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.”\n28 U.S.C. § 2680(a). The discretionary function exception is potentially\napplicable in this case because BOP officials generally exercise significant\njudgment in fulfilling their statutory obligation to provide for the safekeeping,\ncare, and subsistence of all federal prisoners. See 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a) (setting out\nduties of the BOP); Spotts v. United States, 613 F.3d 559, 567 (5th Cir. 2010)\n(“[T]he Federal Bureau of Prisons [must] provide for the safekeeping, care, and\nsubsistence of all federal prisoners, but [Section 4042(a)] does not indicate the\nmanner in which the duty must be fulfilled.”).\n      We must engage in a two-step analysis to determine whether the FTCA\ndiscretionary function exception applies. United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315,\n322-23 (1991). We first ask whether the act “involv[es] an element of judgment\nor choice.” Id. at 322 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If so, we\nthen ask “whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function\nexception was designed to shield.” Id. at 322-23 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). “The requirement of judgment or choice is not satisfied if a\n‘federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for\nan employee to follow,’ because ‘the employee has no rightful option but to\nadhere to the directive.’” Id. at 322 (quoting Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S.\n531, 536 (1988)). If the discretionary function exception applies, this court lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction. See Castro v. United States, 608 F.3d 266, 268 (5th\nCir. 2010) (en banc).\n      As noted above, when this case was previously on appeal, the panel found\nthat a genuine issue of fact existed regarding whether the discretionary function\nexception applied. Ashford, 511 F.3d at 505. Upon remand, however, the\nmagistrate judge failed to address this issue and instead proceeded to the\nquestion of the government’s negligence. Ashford now appeals on the basis that\nthe magistrate judge’s factual findings are clearly erroneous. The government\n\n                                          6\n\f     Case: 10-40804     Document: 00511777725          Page: 7     Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-40804\n\nopposes the appeal on this basis. Neither party, however, addresses the\nimmunity issue on appeal. Nevertheless, it is well settled that “every federal\nappellate court has a special obligation to ‘satisfy itself not only of its own\njurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,’ even\nthough the parties are prepared to concede it.” Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch.\nDist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986) (quoting Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U.S. 237, 244\n(1934)). The Supreme Court has disapproved of the practice of exercising\n“hypothetical jurisdiction,” and has explained that federal courts must resolve\nquestions of jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits. Steel Co. v. Citizens for\na Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998); see also USPPS, Ltd. v. Avery Dennison\nCorp., 647 F.3d 274, 283 & n.6 (5th Cir. 2011); Jasper v. FEMA, 414 F. App’x\n649, 651 (5th Cir. 2011) (“Because a federal court must determine whether\njurisdiction is proper prior to addressing the merits of a case, a district court\nmust first determine if [an FTCA exception applies].”). We must therefore\naddress the applicability of the discretionary function exception to the FTCA,\nand cannot simply avoid this analysis in favor of a resolution on the merits.3\nA.      Discretionary Function Exception - Step One\n        The first Ashford panel determined that the government had failed to\ndemonstrate that the initial step of the discretionary function analysis had been\nsatisfied as a matter of law. It explained:\n\n\n       3\n         Although the magistrate judge entered his factual findings based upon the same\nFlowers hearing that he held prior to granting summary judgment, a Flowers hearing\n“‘amounts to a bench trial replete with credibility determinations and findings of fact.’”\nAshford, 511 F.3d at 504 (quoting McAfee v. Martin, 63 F.3d 436, 437 (5th Cir. 1995)). The\nmagistrate judge was thus not required to conduct a new hearing after the reversal of the\nsummary judgment order. Ashford contends that the magistrate judge should have at least\nprovided notice of his intent to rule based upon the Flowers hearing, and that such notice\nwould have afforded him the opportunity to present other evidence. Although perhaps the\nmagistrate judge could have afforded the parties notice before entry of the findings of fact and\nconclusions of law in this case, we cannot say that this was required. If Ashford believed that\nthe magistrate judge’s findings were incomplete in light of certain evidence, he could have\nsought relief under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59 and 60, but he did not do so.\n\n                                               7\n\f   Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725      Page: 8    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\n      Two Government witnesses, Doty and Hass [sic], testified that if an\n      inmate raised a safety concern like the one Ashford claims he raised\n      at the intake interview, prison policy required him to be put into\n      solitary confinement until an investigation could be conducted. That\n      policy constrained the prison officials’ discretion such that if the\n      factual predicate to the policy was met, there was no room for choice\n      in making the decision whether to place Ashford in solitary\n      confinement. There is a dispute, however, about whether the factual\n      predicate to the policy was met: Ashford claims he raised safety\n      concerns, thereby triggering the policy. Government witnesses\n      testified to the contrary. That fact dispute makes summary\n      judgment on the discretionary-function exception improper.\nAshford, 511 F.3d at 505 (emphasis added). Although the panel did not refer to\na formal BOP policy in its opinion, we understand that the policy at issue was\ndescribed during the Flowers hearing. During cross-examination, Patricia Doty\n(the case management coordinator) had agreed with the government that, if\nAshford had “identified a security threat from an inmate, he would have been\nplaced in some sort of administrative segregation until that could be\ninvestigated.” Haas likewise confirmed that if Ashford had indicated in his\ninitial interview that Smith posed a security threat to him, Ashford would have\nbeen secured in protective custody while the allegations were investigated.\n      Although the magistrate judge did not specifically address the\ndiscretionary function exception, upon remand he did resolve the factual dispute\nraised by the Ashford panel. Based largely upon the testimony of Doty and Haas,\nthe magistrate judge concluded that Ashford failed to raise his security concerns\nat the first intake screening upon arrival at USP-Beaumont, that he declined to\nnote any security concerns on his BOP Intake Screening Form, and that he\nneglected to make his safety concerns known to Haas, who conducted a second\nscreening interview after Ashford’s arrival. Finally, Ashford conceded during the\nFlowers hearing that, after his arrival at USP-Beaumont and his placement in\nthe general population, he did not report any security concerns to prison officials.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f   Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725      Page: 9    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\n      The magistrate judge’s conclusion that Ashford never raised his security\nconcerns to prison officials at USP-Beaumont is certainly plausible in light of the\nrecord as a whole, specifically the testimony of Doty and Haas, which the\nmagistrate judge found credible. We find no clear error in this factual\ndetermination. See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575 (“[W]hen a trial judge’s finding is\nbased on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses,\neach of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not\ncontradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent,\ncan virtually never be clear error.”). Without any safety concerns, prison officials\nwere free to place Ashford in the general population.\n      While the magistrate judge did find that, before his transfer to USP-\nBeaumont, Ashford wrote a letter to regional director Ronald Thompson\nexpressing his safety concerns, there is no indication in the record that the\nappropriate officials at USP-Beaumont received and considered this letter prior\nto the incident. In fact, the only responsive letter from a BOP official, the\nCorrectional Services Administrator, is dated November 23, 2001, after Ashford’s\nNovember 16, 2001 assault.\n      On appeal, Ashford argues that the magistrate judge’s factual findings are\nclearly erroneous because the testimony of Doty and Haas is refuted by two\nseparation orders in his central file, which Ashford now produces for the first\ntime. One such order, bearing the letterhead of the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Corrections Detention Facility, and dated October 22, 1985,\nstates that Ashford was attacked while in transit from court to the jail by\nmembers of the “8th & H Street, N.E. Crew,” including Kelvin Smith. It states\nthat “[t]hese residents are to be kept separated and apart from each other at all\ntimes until further notice and this includes all movement outside the facility.”\nA second letter, dated October 23, 1985, repeats this separation order.\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f  Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725       Page: 10   Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\n      Ashford contends that these separation orders trigger the mandatory\nrequirements of 28 C.F.R. § 524.72(f), and thus render the discretionary function\nexception inapplicable. Section 524.72 relates to Central Inmate Monitoring\n(“CIM”), and provides assignment categories for certain classifications of\ninmates. Subsection (f) relates to “separation” inmates, a term that refers to\n“[i]nmates who may not be confined in the same institution (unless the\ninstitution has the ability to prevent any physical contact between the\nseparatees) with other specified individuals who are presently housed in federal\ncustody or who may come into federal custody in the future.” Id. In making this\nclassification decision, BOP officials may consider “testimony provided by or\nabout an individual (in open court, to a grand jury, etc.), and whether the inmate\nhas exhibited aggressive or intimidating behavior towards other specific\nindividuals, either in the community or within the institution.” Id. The\nclassification “also includes those inmates who have provided authorities with\ninformation concerning the unauthorized or illegal activities of others,” as well\nas “inmates from whom there is no identifiable threat, but who are to be\nseparated from others at the request of the Federal Judiciary or U.S. Attorneys.”\nId. In Parrott v. United States, 536 F.3d 629 (7th Cir. 2008), the Seventh Circuit\nconcluded that Section 524.72(f) requires BOP officials to “‘prevent any physical\ncontact’ between specified separated individuals,” and if the BOP “failed to\nenforce its own classification decision, [the plaintiff] would be able to escape the\nforce of the” FTCA discretionary function exception. Id. at 638. The court\nrecognized, however, that the “existence (or absence) of [a formal separation]\norder is of central importance.” Id.\n      We need not consider whether Section 524.72(f) limits prison officials’\ndiscretion for purposes of the FTCA discretionary function exception, as the\nseparation orders at issue here do not appear in the district court record, and\nwere not presented during the Flowers hearing. Ashford does not explain how\n\n                                        10\n\f  Case: 10-40804        Document: 00511777725           Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                        No. 10-40804\n\nor when he obtained these orders (other than to state that he obtained them\nthrough a Freedom of Information Act request).4 He contends that the October\n22, 1985 separation order is in the district court record, but concedes that the\nOctober 23, 1985 order is not. Our review of the record reveals neither\nseparation order. It is well established that we “may not consider new evidence\nfurnished for the first time on appeal and may not consider facts which were not\nbefore the district court at the time of the challenged ruling.” Theroit v. Parish\nof Jefferson, 185 F.3d 477, 491 n.26 (5th Cir. 1999). We have applied this same\nrule in pro se actions brought by prisoners. See Treece v. Andrews, 188 F. App’x\n230, 230-31 (5th Cir. 2006). We therefore cannot, and do not, consider the\nseparation orders now appended to Ashford’s brief on appeal.\n       On the record before us, we find no clear error in the lower court’s findings\nof fact. Because Ashford failed to raise his security concerns during the intake\nprocess, and the prison’s diligent search failed to reveal the purported separation\norders, the prison had no mandatory obligation to separate Ashford from Smith.\nInstead, Ashford’s classification and placement upon arrival were in the prison’s\ndiscretion. We conclude that placement of Ashford in the general population at\nUSP-Beaumont involved an element of “judgment or choice,” Gaubert, 499 U.S.\nat 322, and thus satisfies the first step of the discretionary function analysis.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          We note that these two separation orders were addressed in another lawsuit that\nAshford filed against the District of Columbia, Ashford v. District of Columbia, No. 02-1955\n(D.D.C.), which sought to hold D.C. officials liable for failing to relay the separation orders to\nofficials at USP-Beaumont. In that case, D.C. corrections officials stated that Ashford’s file\ncontained no separation orders with respect to Smith, and contended that the separation\norders Ashford produced had been fabricated. Ashford v. District of Columbia, No. 02-1955,\n2006 WL 2711530, at *2 (D.D.C. Sept. 21, 2006). The district court ultimately did not resolve\nthis issue, finding instead that the “authenticity of these memoranda does not affect the legal\nanalysis,” since it found no evidence of deliberate indifference by the municipality to support\na claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. at *3.\n\n                                               11\n\f     Case: 10-40804   Document: 00511777725    Page: 12   Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\nB.      Discretionary Function Exception - Step Two\n        The second step in our discretionary function analysis requires us to ask\nwhether the judgment at issue “is of the kind that the discretionary function\nexception was designed to shield.” Id. at 322-23 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). “Because the purpose of the exception is to prevent judicial\nsecond-guessing of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,\neconomic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort, when\nproperly construed, the exception protects only governmental actions and\ndecisions based on considerations of public policy.” Id. at 323 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\n        Maintaining order and security in prison is the type of policy-based\ndecision that the discretionary function exception shields. In Patel v. United\nStates, 398 F. App’x 22 (5th Cir. 2010), we addressed whether the discretionary\nfunction exception applied in a suit brought by an inmate with certain medical\nconditions who challenged the government’s decisions to transfer him to\nnumerous facilities without providing proper medical care. Id. at 25. Finding\nthat the discretionary function exception applied, we reasoned that “decisions\nregarding the transfers and classifications of prisoners generally fall within the\ndiscretionary function exception,” and that the transfers at issue were the kind\nof decision that the “‘discretionary function exception was designed to shield.’”\nId. at 29 (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-23). Other circuits have agreed. See\nCohen v. United States, 151 F.3d 1338, 1344 (11th Cir. 1998) (“Deciding how to\nclassify prisoners and choosing the institution in which to place them are part\nand parcel of the inherently policy-laden endeavor of maintaining order and\npreserving security within our nation’s prisons.”); Dykstra v. U.S. Bureau of\nPrisons, 140 F.3d 791, 796 (8th Cir. 1998) (“Prison officials supervise inmates\nbased upon security levels, available resources, classification of inmates, and\nother factors. These factors upon which prison officials base such decisions are\n\n                                        12\n\f  Case: 10-40804     Document: 00511777725      Page: 13    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-40804\n\ninherently grounded in social, political, and economic policy. We have no\ndifficulty in concluding that the discretionary function exception applies to the\ncorrectional officer’s decision not to place Dykstra in protective custody or to take\nother protective action.”); Calderon v. United States, 123 F.3d 947, 951 (7th Cir.\n1997) (“It is clear that balancing the need to provide inmate security with the\nrights of the inmates to circulate and socialize within the prison involves\nconsiderations based upon public policy.”). We see no reason to depart from these\nwell-reasoned decisions. The classification decision at issue here “is of the kind\nthat the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.” Gaubert, 499\nU.S. at 322-23.\n      Thus, in light of the magistrate judge’s factfinding based upon the Flowers\nhearing, we conclude that the discretionary function exception to the FTCA is\napplicable, and the court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this\naction. See Castro, 608 F.3d at 268. Although the lower court erred by failing to\nresolve this jurisdictional issue before proceeding to the merits, we ultimately\naffirm its dismissal of this case on the jurisdictional basis discussed herein. We\ntherefore do not consider the merits of Ashford’s negligence claim.\n      Because we conclude that the magistrate judge should have dismissed\nAshford’s claim under the FTCA for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the\ndismissal should have been without prejudice. See Davis v. United States, 961\nF.2d 53, 56-58 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that FTCA claim was properly dismissed\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but that district court was “incorrect to\ndismiss [the] case with prejudice,” and therefore remanding for entry of order of\ndismissal without prejudice); see also Hix v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 155 F.\nApp’x 121, 128 (5th Cir. 2005) (“[B]ecause it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\nover Appellants’ [FTCA] claims, the district court erred in dismissing the claims\nwith prejudice, which also operates as a judgment on the merits.”). As such, we\naffirm the magistrate judge’s dismissal of the action, but vacate the final order\n\n                                         13\n\f  Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725     Page: 14   Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-40804\n\nof dismissal and remand to the district court for the entry of a judgment of\ndismissal of Ashford’s FTCA claim without prejudice.\n                              IV. CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the magistrate judge’s dismissal\nof the action, but VACATE the final order of dismissal with prejudice and\nREMAND to the district court with instructions to enter a judgment of dismissal\nof all claims without prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                       14\n\f",

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      As punishment for an August 2001 disciplinary infraction committed at\na medium security federal correctional complex in Beaumont, Texas, Plaintiff-\nAppellant Edward Ashford (“Ashford”) was transferred to the United States\nPenitentiary in Beaumont (“USP-Beaumont”), a high security institution.\nAshford was concerned that this move would place him in the same facility as\ncertain prisoners from the Washington, D.C. area. Although Ashford had been\ninvolved in incidents with several prisoners from that area (due to his prior\ncooperation with law enforcement and his father’s service as a corrections officer\nin the Washington, D.C. jail), he was particularly concerned about an inmate\nnamed Kelvin Smith, who had attacked him in 1985 when the two had\npreviously been incarcerated together. Ashford contends that Smith’s attack had\nprompted corrections officers in Washington, D.C. to issue separation orders,\nforbidding the two inmates from being confined in the same prison population.\nAshford’s troubles with Smith followed him throughout the federal system, as\nSmith attempted to orchestrate attacks while Ashford was incarcerated at\nfacilities in Terre Haute, Indiana and Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f   Case: 10-40804   Document: 00511777725      Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-40804\n\n      Ashford contends that, prior to his transfer, he explained his concerns to\nthe warden of the medium security facility in Beaumont, Jonathon Dobre. The\nwarden advised him to contact several different Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nofficials, including Ronald Thompson, Regional Director for the South Central\nRegional Office for the BOP. Ashford wrote these officials to explain that he\nshould not be housed with prisoners from Washington, D.C., including Smith.\nAshford claims that the warden assured him that his safety concerns would be\ninvestigated before his transfer.\n      Shortly thereafter, and before his concerns were investigated, Ashford was\ntransferred to USP-Beaumont. When Ashford arrived at the prison, he was\ninterviewed by Lieutenant Russell Haas. Ashford claims that he provided Haas\nwith details of his history with Smith, and asked whether Smith was housed at\nthe facility. According to Ashford, Haas assured him that Smith was not\nincarcerated at USP-Beaumont. This, however, was not the case, as Smith was\nin fact incarcerated there. Haas, however, claims that Ashford never mentioned\nSmith during the intake interview. Ashford also completed an Intake Screening\nForm upon his arrival, which asked, inter alia, “[d]o you know of any reason that\nyou should not be placed in general population?” He responded, “No.”\n      After the intake interview, Ashford was placed in the general population\nat USP-Beaumont. On November 16, 2001, just two days after his arrival,\nAshford was told by certain inmates to “check in,” meaning that he should enter\nprotective custody due to an impending attack. Approximately six hours later,\nan inmate approached Ashford and purportedly said: “I ain’t got no beef with you\npersonally, right; but [Smith] sent us.” Ashford was then viciously attacked and\nstabbed approximately 13 times. He sustained wounds to his back, head, inner\nleft ear canal, and upper torso. His left lung was punctured. The attack has left\nAshford with both hearing and vision problems.\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f   Case: 10-40804      Document: 00511777725        Page: 4    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                     No. 10-40804\n\n      Ashford subsequently brought suit against the United States and several\nprison officials under the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1346,\nand Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971).1 His FTCA claim alleged that the government negligently\nplaced him in the general prison population with Smith and other prisoners from\nWashington, D.C. The parties consented to have a magistrate judge hear and\ndecide the FTCA claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), and the magistrate judge\nheld a Flowers evidentiary hearing.2 After the hearing, the magistrate judge\ndeclined to make credibility determinations, and instead granted the\ngovernment’s summary judgment motion based upon the discretionary function\nexception to the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).\n      Ashford appealed the magistrate judge’s judgment, and a panel of this\ncourt reversed, holding that a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to\nwhether Ashford raised his safety concerns to officials at USP-Beaumont,\nthereby triggering a prison policy that required officials to put Ashford in\nsolitary confinement until an investigation could be conducted. Ashford v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"55790\"><a href=\"/opinion/55790/ashford-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (5th Cir. 2007). The panel reasoned that this policy\n“constrained the prison officials’ discretion such that if the factual predicate to\nthe policy was met, there was no room for choice in making the decision whether\nto place Ashford in solitary confinement,” and thus the discretionary function\nexception to the FTCA would not apply. Id. The panel then remanded the case\nto the magistrate judge to determine whether in fact this mandatory prison\npolicy was triggered in light of the facts of the case.\n\n\n\n      1\n        Ashford’s Bivens claims against the individual defendants were dismissed, and\nAshford does not appeal this decision. As such, only Ashford’s FTCA claim against the\ngovernment remains.\n      2\n         See Flowers v.

Instead of addressing the FTCA discretionary\nfunction exception, however, the magistrate judge proceeded to the merits and\nconcluded that the government was not negligent. Ashford now appeals again.\n                         II.

DISCUSSION\n      The FTCA is a limited waiver of the United States’ sovereign immunity\nfrom suit for claims regarding “injury or loss of property, or personal injury or\ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the\nGovernment while acting within the scope of his office or employment.” 28\nU.S.C. § 1346(b)(1). We strictly construe such waivers, resolving all ambiguities\nin favor of the sovereign. See Lane v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118049\"><a href=\"/opinion/118049/lane-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (1996). The FTCA’s\ndiscretionary function exception provides that sovereign immunity is not waived\nfor any claim “based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise\nor perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an\n\n                                         5\n\f   Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725       Page: 6    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-40804\n\nemployee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.”\n28 U.S.C. § 2680(a). The discretionary function exception is potentially\napplicable in this case because BOP officials generally exercise significant\njudgment in fulfilling their statutory obligation to provide for the safekeeping,\ncare, and subsistence of all federal prisoners. See 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a) (setting out\nduties of the BOP); Spotts v.

We must therefore\naddress the applicability of the discretionary function exception to the FTCA,\nand cannot simply avoid this analysis in favor of a resolution on the merits.3\nA.      Discretionary Function Exception - Step One\n        The first Ashford panel determined that the government had failed to\ndemonstrate that the initial step of the discretionary function analysis had been\nsatisfied as a matter of law. It explained:\n\n\n       3\n         Although the magistrate judge entered his factual findings based upon the same\nFlowers hearing that he held prior to granting summary judgment, a Flowers hearing\n“‘amounts to a bench trial replete with credibility determinations and findings of fact.’”\nAshford, 511 F.3d at 504 (quoting McAfee v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7722\"><a href=\"/opinion/7722/mcafee-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (5th Cir. 1995)). The\nmagistrate judge was thus not required to conduct a new hearing after the reversal of the\nsummary judgment order. Ashford contends that the magistrate judge should have at least\nprovided notice of his intent to rule based upon the Flowers hearing, and that such notice\nwould have afforded him the opportunity to present other evidence. Although perhaps the\nmagistrate judge could have afforded the parties notice before entry of the findings of fact and\nconclusions of law in this case, we cannot say that this was required. If Ashford believed that\nthe magistrate judge’s findings were incomplete in light of certain evidence, he could have\nsought relief under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59 and 60, but he did not do so.\n\n                                               7\n\f   Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725      Page: 8    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\n      Two Government witnesses, Doty and Hass [sic], testified that if an\n      inmate raised a safety concern like the one Ashford claims he raised\n      at the intake interview, prison policy required him to be put into\n      solitary confinement until an investigation could be conducted. That\n      policy constrained the prison officials’ discretion such that if the\n      factual predicate to the policy was met, there was no room for choice\n      in making the decision whether to place Ashford in solitary\n      confinement. There is a dispute, however, about whether the factual\n      predicate to the policy was met: Ashford claims he raised safety\n      concerns, thereby triggering the policy. Government witnesses\n      testified to the contrary. That fact dispute makes summary\n      judgment on the discretionary-function exception improper.\nAshford, 511 F.3d at 505 (emphasis added). Although the panel did not refer to\na formal BOP policy in its opinion, we understand that the policy at issue was\ndescribed during the Flowers hearing. During cross-examination, Patricia Doty\n(the case management coordinator) had agreed with the government that, if\nAshford had “identified a security threat from an inmate, he would have been\nplaced in some sort of administrative segregation until that could be\ninvestigated.” Haas likewise confirmed that if Ashford had indicated in his\ninitial interview that Smith posed a security threat to him, Ashford would have\nbeen secured in protective custody while the allegations were investigated.\n      Although the magistrate judge did not specifically address the\ndiscretionary function exception, upon remand he did resolve the factual dispute\nraised by the Ashford panel. Based largely upon the testimony of Doty and Haas,\nthe magistrate judge concluded that Ashford failed to raise his security concerns\nat the first intake screening upon arrival at USP-Beaumont, that he declined to\nnote any security concerns on his BOP Intake Screening Form, and that he\nneglected to make his safety concerns known to Haas, who conducted a second\nscreening interview after Ashford’s arrival. Finally, Ashford conceded during the\nFlowers hearing that, after his arrival at USP-Beaumont and his placement in\nthe general population, he did not report any security concerns to prison officials.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f   Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725      Page: 9    Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\n      The magistrate judge’s conclusion that Ashford never raised his security\nconcerns to prison officials at USP-Beaumont is certainly plausible in light of the\nrecord as a whole, specifically the testimony of Doty and Haas, which the\nmagistrate judge found credible. We find no clear error in this factual\ndetermination. See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575 (“[W]hen a trial judge’s finding is\nbased on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses,\neach of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not\ncontradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent,\ncan virtually never be clear error.”). Without any safety concerns, prison officials\nwere free to place Ashford in the general population.\n      While the magistrate judge did find that, before his transfer to USP-\nBeaumont, Ashford wrote a letter to regional director Ronald Thompson\nexpressing his safety concerns, there is no indication in the record that the\nappropriate officials at USP-Beaumont received and considered this letter prior\nto the incident. In fact, the only responsive letter from a BOP official, the\nCorrectional Services Administrator, is dated November 23, 2001, after Ashford’s\nNovember 16, 2001 assault.\n      On appeal, Ashford argues that the magistrate judge’s factual findings are\nclearly erroneous because the testimony of Doty and Haas is refuted by two\nseparation orders in his central file, which Ashford now produces for the first\ntime. One such order, bearing the letterhead of the District of Columbia\nDepartment of Corrections Detention Facility, and dated October 22, 1985,\nstates that Ashford was attacked while in transit from court to the jail by\nmembers of the “8th & H Street, N.E. Crew,” including Kelvin Smith. It states\nthat “[t]hese residents are to be kept separated and apart from each other at all\ntimes until further notice and this includes all movement outside the facility.”\nA second letter, dated October 23, 1985, repeats this separation order.\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f  Case: 10-40804    Document: 00511777725       Page: 10   Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\n      Ashford contends that these separation orders trigger the mandatory\nrequirements of 28 C.F.R. § 524.72(f), and thus render the discretionary function\nexception inapplicable. Section 524.72 relates to Central Inmate Monitoring\n(“CIM”), and provides assignment categories for certain classifications of\ninmates. Subsection (f) relates to “separation” inmates, a term that refers to\n“[i]nmates who may not be confined in the same institution (unless the\ninstitution has the ability to prevent any physical contact between the\nseparatees) with other specified individuals who are presently housed in federal\ncustody or who may come into federal custody in the future.” Id. In making this\nclassification decision, BOP officials may consider “testimony provided by or\nabout an individual (in open court, to a grand jury, etc.), and whether the inmate\nhas exhibited aggressive or intimidating behavior towards other specific\nindividuals, either in the community or within the institution.” Id. The\nclassification “also includes those inmates who have provided authorities with\ninformation concerning the unauthorized or illegal activities of others,” as well\nas “inmates from whom there is no identifiable threat, but who are to be\nseparated from others at the request of the Federal Judiciary or U.S. Attorneys.”\nId. In Parrott v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399743\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399743/parrott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2008), the Seventh Circuit\nconcluded that Section 524.72(f) requires BOP officials to “‘prevent any physical\ncontact’ between specified separated individuals,” and if the BOP “failed to\nenforce its own classification decision, [the plaintiff] would be able to escape the\nforce of the” FTCA discretionary function exception. Id. at 638. The court\nrecognized, however, that the “existence (or absence) of [a formal separation]\norder is of central importance.” Id.\n      We need not consider whether Section 524.72(f) limits prison officials’\ndiscretion for purposes of the FTCA discretionary function exception, as the\nseparation orders at issue here do not appear in the district court record, and\nwere not presented during the Flowers hearing. Ashford does not explain how\n\n                                        10\n\f  Case: 10-40804        Document: 00511777725           Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                        No. 10-40804\n\nor when he obtained these orders (other than to state that he obtained them\nthrough a Freedom of Information Act request).4 He contends that the October\n22, 1985 separation order is in the district court record, but concedes that the\nOctober 23, 1985 order is not. Our review of the record reveals neither\nseparation order. It is well established that we “may not consider new evidence\nfurnished for the first time on appeal and may not consider facts which were not\nbefore the district court at the time of the challenged ruling.” Theroit v. Parish\nof Jefferson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765385\"><a href=\"/opinion/765385/dennis-theriot-ann-rodriguez-ronald-perrin-norman-a-ronquille-david-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491 n.26 (5th Cir. 1999). We have applied this same\nrule in pro se actions brought by prisoners. See Treece v. Andrews, 188 F. App’x\n230, 230-31 (5th Cir. 2006). We therefore cannot, and do not, consider the\nseparation orders now appended to Ashford’s brief on appeal.\n       On the record before us, we find no clear error in the lower court’s findings\nof fact. Because Ashford failed to raise his security concerns during the intake\nprocess, and the prison’s diligent search failed to reveal the purported separation\norders, the prison had no mandatory obligation to separate Ashford from Smith.\nInstead, Ashford’s classification and placement upon arrival were in the prison’s\ndiscretion. We conclude that placement of Ashford in the general population at\nUSP-Beaumont involved an element of “judgment or choice,” Gaubert, 499 U.S.\nat 322, and thus satisfies the first step of the discretionary function analysis.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          We note that these two separation orders were addressed in another lawsuit that\nAshford filed against the District of Columbia, Ashford v. District of Columbia, No. 02-1955\n(D.D.C.), which sought to hold D.C. officials liable for failing to relay the separation orders to\nofficials at USP-Beaumont. In that case, D.C. corrections officials stated that Ashford’s file\ncontained no separation orders with respect to Smith, and contended that the separation\norders Ashford produced had been fabricated.

District of Columbia, No. 02-1955,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2711530</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (D.D.C. Sept. 21, 2006). The district court ultimately did not resolve\nthis issue, finding instead that the “authenticity of these memoranda does not affect the legal\nanalysis,” since it found no evidence of deliberate indifference by the municipality to support\na claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. at *3.\n\n                                               11\n\f     Case: 10-40804   Document: 00511777725    Page: 12   Date Filed: 03/05/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-40804\n\nB.      Discretionary Function Exception - Step Two\n        The second step in our discretionary function analysis requires us to ask\nwhether the judgment at issue “is of the kind that the discretionary function\nexception was designed to shield.” Id. at 322-23 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). “Because the purpose of the exception is to prevent judicial\nsecond-guessing of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,\neconomic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort, when\nproperly construed, the exception protects only governmental actions and\ndecisions based on considerations of public policy.” Id. at 323 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\n        Maintaining order and security in prison is the type of policy-based\ndecision that the discretionary function exception shields. In Patel v. United\nStates, 398 F. App’x 22 (5th Cir. 2010), we addressed whether the discretionary\nfunction exception applied in a suit brought by an inmate with certain medical\nconditions who challenged the government’s decisions to transfer him to\nnumerous facilities without providing proper medical care. Id. at 25. Finding\nthat the discretionary function exception applied, we reasoned that “decisions\nregarding the transfers and classifications of prisoners generally fall within the\ndiscretionary function exception,” and that the transfers at issue were the kind\nof decision that the “‘discretionary function exception was designed to shield.’”\nId. at 29 (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-23). Other circuits have agreed. See\nCohen v.

The classification decision at issue here “is of the kind\nthat the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.” Gaubert, 499\nU.S. at 322-23.\n      Thus, in light of the magistrate judge’s factfinding based upon the Flowers\nhearing, we conclude that the discretionary function exception to the FTCA is\napplicable, and the court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this\naction. See Castro, 608 F.3d at 268. Although the lower court erred by failing to\nresolve this jurisdictional issue before proceeding to the merits, we ultimately\naffirm its dismissal of this case on the jurisdictional basis discussed herein. We\ntherefore do not consider the merits of Ashford’s negligence claim.\n      Because we conclude that the magistrate judge should have dismissed\nAshford’s claim under the FTCA for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the\ndismissal should have been without prejudice.
