Lang, Assistant United States Attorney, Seattle,\nWashington, for the plaintiff-appellee.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nMcKEOWN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Mohamed Jawara (a.k.a. Haji Jawara) appeals from his\nconvictions for document fraud related to his personal asylum\napplication and conspiracy to commit marriage fraud to avoid\nthe immigration laws. Jawara challenges the district court’s\ndenial of his motions to sever the two counts, to suppress\nphysical evidence, and to conduct a pre-trial hearing address-\ning the reliability of expert testimony, as well as various evi-\ndentiary rulings by the district court. We focus primarily on\nJawara’s claim of misjoinder and clarify the framework for\nassessing whether the joined offenses are of the “same or sim-\nilar character” under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a).\nLooking to the indictment, we conclude that the two counts\nare unrelated in nature and purpose, temporal scope, physical\nlocation, modes of operation, and key evidence. To suggest\nthat joinder is proper simply because each involves an immi-\ngration matter would stretch the “same or similar character”\nbasis for joinder beyond reasonable limits. Although we hold\nthat the counts were in fact misjoined, error does not warrant\nreversal in this case. Nor did the district court commit revers-\nible error with respect to the other matters challenged by\nJawara. We affirm the convictions.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n\n  In December 2000, “Haji Jawara” executed Immigration\nand Naturalization Service form I-589, an application for\n\f11356              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nasylum and withholding of removal. In this application, he\nclaimed, among other things, to be a native of Sierra Leone\nand a member of the Maraka tribe who had suffered imprison-\nment and witnessed the killing of his parents at the hands of\nrebels in Sierra Leone. The asylum application was prepared\nby a man who called himself “Mohamed Ali.” Copies of two\nidentity documents were attached to the asylum application:\na Republic of Sierra Leone identity card and a “Death Certifi-\ncate” purportedly issued by the Ministry of Health of the\nRepublic of Sierra Leone. Although the “Death Certificate”\nwas apparently submitted to certify Haji Jawara’s birth in\nSierra Leone, the certificate, in fact, stated that Haji Jawara\n“died 4th July 1979 at 6:45 p.m. at Kono Government Hospi-\ntal” in Sierra Leone.\n\n   Three years later, Darrick Smalley, a senior special agent\nwith Immigration and Customs Enforcement, began investi-\ngating the activities of “Mohamed Jawara,” as part of a larger\ninvestigation involving several individuals. During the course\nof his investigation, Agent Smalley discovered that “Mo-\nhamed Jawara” was also using the name “Haji Jawara,” and\nthat in 1999, “Mohamed Jawara” had submitted applications\nfor a visa and a social security number, in which he claimed\nThe Gambia as his birthplace and provided his Gambian pass-\nport.\n\n   The following year, while this investigation was still pend-\ning, Jawara approached his friend Peter Coleman for help in\nfinding a citizen to marry his friend “Ibrahim” for immigra-\ntion purposes. Coleman, unbeknownst to Jawara, was a paid\ninformant who had assisted federal law enforcement authori-\nties in several cases since his own arrest in 2001. In June\n2004, Coleman met Jawara and Ibrahim at a coffee shop and\nintroduced them to Carol, a prospective marriage candidate.\nThey discussed the mechanics of a potential sham marriage,\nincluding housing and living arrangements. Coleman wore a\nrecording device during this meeting, and federal agents,\nincluding Agent Smalley, monitored the meeting and took\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                 11357\nphotographs. Some months later, Coleman had another meet-\ning with Jawara, also recorded, at which Jawara sought Cole-\nman’s help in finding a wife for himself.\n\n   In November 2004, law enforcement officials arrested\nJawara and executed a search warrant at his apartment, where\nthey recovered various documents, including his Sierra Leone\nidentity card and death certificate. A grand jury indicted\nJawara on one count of fraud related to immigration docu-\nments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a), and one count of\nconspiracy to commit marriage fraud, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 371 and 8 U.S.C. § 1325.\n\n  The document fraud charge read, in pertinent part:\n\n    On or about December 23, 2000, . . . MOHAMED\n    JAWARA, aka: HAJI JAWARA, did knowingly\n    make false statements under oath, and . . . knowingly\n    subscribed as true, false statements with respect to a\n    material fact in an application . . . required by the\n    immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereun-\n    der, and knowingly presented such application\n    . . . which contained such false statement . . . that is,\n    in an Immigration and Naturalization Service Form\n    I-589 (Application for Asylum or For Withholding\n    of Removal), the defendant made the following false\n    statements . . . .\n\nThe false statements alleged in the superceding indictment\nincluded Jawara’s response of “Sierra Leone” to questions\nregarding his nationality and birthplace.\n\n  The marriage fraud conspiracy charge read, in pertinent\npart:\n\n    At an exact time unknown, but beginning within the\n    past five years and continuing until on or around\n    November 13, 2004 . . . MOHAMED JAWARA,\n\f11358              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n    aka: HAJI JAWARA, and others . . . did knowingly\n    and willfully conspire . . . to enter into, and to aid\n    and abet others to enter into, a marriage for the pur-\n    pose of evading any provision of the immigration\n    law . . . .\n\nThe superceding indictment alleged that Jawara committed\nthe following overt acts in furtherance of the marriage fraud\nconspiracy:\n\n    a.   On or about June 24, 2004, . . . JAWARA did\n         facilitate a meeting between a cooperating wit-\n         ness, identified as P.C., an alien, and a female\n         United States citizen, in which the conspirators\n         discussed having the United States citizen marry\n         the alien in order to evade the immigration laws\n         of the United States.\n\n    b.   On or about November 13, 2004, . . .\n         JAWARA[ ] did meet with and solicit a cooper-\n         ating witness, identified as P.C., to procure a\n         United States citizen who would agree to marry\n         JAWARA in order to evade the immigration\n         laws of the United States.\n\n  Prior to trial, Jawara moved to sever the two counts, assert-\ning misjoinder under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a)\nand prejudicial joinder under Federal Rule of Criminal Proce-\ndure 14. Jawara also moved to suppress the documentary evi-\ndence seized during the search of his residence. After a\nhearing, the district court denied both motions.\n\n   Jawara also moved in limine to exclude the proposed expert\ntestimony of Carolyn Bayer-Broring, a forensic document\nexaminer employed by the Department of Homeland Security,\nregarding the authenticity of Jawara’s documents from Sierra\nLeone. Jawara requested a separate hearing to assess the reli-\nability of Bayer-Broring’s expert testimony. After an in limine\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11359\nhearing, the district court denied the motion to exclude the\nexpert testimony and determined that a separate Daubert hear-\ning was unnecessary. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharma-\nceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). The district court also\ndenied Jawara’s motions in limine to exclude certain aspects\nof Agent Smalley’s testimony and school examination records\nfrom The Gambia listing Mohamed Jawara as a local student.\n\n   At trial, Agent Smalley testified about his role in the inves-\ntigation, the asylum process in general, and the importance of\ncountry conditions in asylum determinations. Over defense\ncounsel’s objections, Agent Smalley testified that: (1) based\non his review of State Department country reports, country\nconditions in Sierra Leone were comparatively worse than in\nThe Gambia; (2) a substantially larger percentage of asylum\napplications were received from natives of Sierra Leone than\nThe Gambia; and (3) based on his review of various computer\nindices, including a site called “ethnolog.com,” the Maraka\ntribe (to which Jawara had claimed membership in his asylum\napplication) was not located in Sierra Leone but in The Gam-\nbia. Citing expertise in the area of forensic document exami-\nnation, Bayer-Broring also testified that the Sierra Leone\nidentity card and death certificate recovered from Jawara’s\napartment were counterfeit.\n\n   The government’s case included the testimony of two coop-\nerating witnesses: Essa Jobarteh and Peter Coleman. Jobarteh\ntestified that he was Jawara’s high school classmate at St.\nAugustine’s Secondary School in The Gambia from 1995 to\n1998 and that he knew Jawara by the names “Haji” and “Mo-\nhamed.” Jobarteh became reacquainted with Jawara in 2004\nat a party in the Seattle area. Jobarteh testified that when he\nsought Jawara’s advice about securing asylum in the United\nStates, Jawara advised him to get married instead because\n“it’s quicker to get your papers” and to marry an older woman\nbecause they were “kind of more desperate.” Over defense\ncounsel’s objection, the court admitted two examination\nrecords issued by the West African Examinations Counsel,\n\f11360                UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nlisting Mohamed Jawara as a student at St. Augustine’s in The\nGambia.\n\n  Coleman testified that Jawara represented himself as a\nGambian whose parents were still alive, that he knew Jawara\nby the names “Haji” and “Mohamed,” and that he and Jawara\nhad spoken generally about how “you can use someone else’s\ndocuments from another country” for immigration purposes.\nColeman recounted his discussions with Jawara about finding\na wife, first for Ibrahim, and then later, for Jawara himself.\nThe recorded meetings were played for the jury. During the\nNovember 2004 meeting, Jawara was recorded as saying that\nhe needed a wife for himself because he was “going through\nsome stuff with the INS . . . about [his] papers” and that he\nwanted to “finish [his] stuff and get [his] citizenship.”\n\n   The defense’s case consisted of Jawara’s testimony. Jawara\ntestified that his real name was Haji, he was born in Sierra\nLeone, and “Mohamed Jawara” was the name of his Gambian\ncousin, whose passport he borrowed to enter the United\nStates. He admitted using Mohamed Jawara’s passport and\nname to obtain various identity cards in the United States, but\nafter a few months, he sent the passport back to The Gambia.\nWith respect to the document fraud charge, Jawara acknowl-\nedged several falsehoods in his asylum application, including\nthe nature of his parents’ death. He maintained that he was\nunaware of the falsehoods at the time the application was filed\nbecause he was misled by Mohamed Ali,1 who prepared the\napplication. Jawara testified that aside from providing Ali\nwith copies of his Sierra Leonean identity card and death cer-\ntificate, he had no role in preparing the application and read\nno part of it before signing. Jawara denied attending high\n  1\n   The real name of this individual was apparently “Souleymane\nCamara.” The superceding indictment also charged Camara and two other\ndefendants with multiple counts of immigration fraud; the government\nagreed to sever Jawara’s trial from the proceedings of the other named\ndefendants.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                 11361\nschool with Jobarteh in The Gambia or advising him to marry\na citizen. Jawara maintained that the fraudulent marriage idea\noriginated with Coleman and that Coleman initiated all dis-\ncussions and meetings on the subject.\n\n   The jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts. The dis-\ntrict court sentenced Jawara to ten months confinement, fol-\nlowed by two years of supervised release.\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\nI.   JOINDER AND SEVERANCE\n\n  Jawara argues the two counts were improperly joined under\nRule 8(a). Alternatively, he argues that even if the initial join-\nder was proper, the district court should have severed the\ncounts under Rule 14 because the joinder was prejudicial.\n\n   [1] Rule 8(a) provides for joinder of offenses against a sin-\ngle defendant in the indictment if one of three conditions is\nsatisfied. The offenses charged must be: (1) “of the same or\nsimilar character;” (2) “based on the same act or transaction;”\nor (3) “connected with or constitut[ing] parts of a common\nscheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Misjoinder of charges\nunder Rule 8(a) is a question of law reviewed de novo. United\nStates v. Terry, 911 F.2d 272, 276 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n   Rule 14 permits the district court to “order separate trials\nof counts” at its discretion “[i]f the joinder of offenses . . . in\nan indictment . . . appears to prejudice a defendant.” Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 14(a). Thus, “[e]ven if joinder is permissible under\nRule 8, a party who feels prejudiced by joinder may move to\nsever pursuant to [Rule] 14.” United States v. Smith, 795 F.2d\n841, 850 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1032 (1987).\n\f11362                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n  A.     JOINDER UNDER RULE 8(A)\n\n   [2] We take the view that “[b]ecause Rule 8 is concerned\nwith the propriety of joining offenses in the indictment, the\nvalidity of the joinder is determined solely by the allegations\nin the indictment.” Terry, 911 F.2d at 276; see also United\nStates v. VonWillie, 59 F.3d 922, 929 (9th Cir. 1995) (“In\nmaking our assessment, we examine only the allegations in\nthe indictment.”). Thus, in Terry, we observed that “there is\nno need to assess what actually happened in the trial” as part\nof a Rule 8 inquiry. 911 F.2d at 277. Though on occasion,\nour decisions have noted matters outside of the indictment,2\nthe established rule in this circuit is that a valid basis for join-\nder should be discernible from the face of the indictment,3 and\nwe remain faithful to that principle here.4\n   2\n     For example, in VonWillie, we recited the “indictment-only” standard\nand explained that joinder was proper because the “indictment charges\n[defendant] in count 1 with possessing the same three weapons that he is\ncharged in count 2 with using in relation to a drug trafficking crime”;\nhowever, we went on to note that “[t]estimonial and physical evidence . . .\nis also common to both counts.” 59 F.3d at 929. Similarly, in United\nStates v. Fiorillo, 186 F.3d 1136, 1145 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam), we\nnoted that “at least three witnesses testified at the trial concerning both”\ncounts.\n   3\n     The majority of circuits apply the “indictment-only” standard, as we do\n—at least in name, if not always in practice. See, e.g., United States v. But-\nler, 429 F.3d 140, 146 (5th Cir. 2005) (“Whether the initial joinder of\ncharges was improper under Rule 8 . . . is judged according to the allega-\ntions in the . . . indictment.”); United States v. Chavis, 296 F.3d 450, 456\n(6th Cir. 2002) (same); United States v. Wadena, 152 F.3d 831, 848 (8th\nCir. 1998) (same); United States v. Coleman, 22 F.3d 126, 134 (7th Cir.\n1994) (same); United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 306 (1st Cir. 1991)\n(“In the ordinary case, a rational basis for joinder of multiple counts\nshould be discernible from the face of the indictment.”).\n   4\n     We note that some of our sister circuits have adopted a modified\napproach. For example, the Fourth Circuit has explicitly held that “compli-\nance with Rule 8(a) is determined by examining the indictment and evi-\ndence presented at trial.” United States v. Cardwell, 433 F.3d 378, 385 n.\n1 (4th Cir. 2005) (emphasis added). Two other circuits have explicitly held\nthat courts may consider governmental proffers of evidence before trial,\nin addition to allegations in the indictment, when assessing the propriety\nof joinder under Rule 8. See United States v. Dominguez, 226 F.3d 1235,\n\f                         UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                          11363\n   Because Rule 14 is available “as a remedy for prejudice\nthat may develop during the trial,” Rule 8 has been “broadly\nconstrued in favor of initial joinder . . . .” United States v.\nFriedman, 445 F.2d 1076, 1082 (9th Cir. 1971).5 Nonetheless,\nthe joinder decision warrants scrutiny, and Rule 14 should not\nbe viewed as a backstop or substitute for the initial analysis\nrequired under Rule 8(a). At least one of Rule 8(a)’s three\nconditions must be satisfied for proper joinder, and “those\nconditions, although phrased in general terms, are not infi-\nnitely elastic.” United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 627\n(1st Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Cardwell, 433 F.3d\n378, 385 (4th Cir. 2005). In Jawara’s case, the government\ninvokes two of the three bases for joinder: that the counts\n\n1241 (11th Cir. 2000) (“It is enough that when faced with a Rule 8 motion,\nthe prosecutor proffers evidence which will show the connection between\nthe charges.”); United States v. Halliman, 923 F.2d 873, 883 (D.C. Cir.\n1991) (“In this circuit, . . . the government need not demonstrate the pro-\npriety of its joinder decisions on the face of the indictment . . . . Rather,\nthe government need only present evidence before trial [justifying join-\nder].”).\n   5\n     Several circuits embrace this justification for broadly construing initial\njoinder. See, e.g., United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 627 (1st Cir.\n1996) (“Rule 8(a)’s joinder provision is generously construed in favor of\njoinder . . . in part because [Rule] 14 provides a separate layer of protec-\ntion where it is most needed.”); Coleman, 22 F.3d at 134 (explaining the\n“respective roles of Rule 8 and Rule 14”). Although this rationale makes\nsense in theory, commentators have questioned this justification in prac-\ntice: “Given the evident reluctance of . . . courts to grant separate trials\nunder Rule 14, a broad interpretation of Rule 8 means broad joinder,\nwhether or not this is just or fair.” 1A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, FEDERAL\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 143 (3d ed. 1999); see also Note, Harmless\nError and Misjoinder Under the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure: A\nNarrowing Division of Opinion, 6 HOFSTRA L. REV. 533, 536 n. 14 (1978)\n(“For the defendant who goes to trial properly joined under rule 8, the\nchances of receiving a separate trial at a later time are unlikely at the trial\nlevel and even less likely on appeal. . . . It is for this reason that the courts’\ninterpretation of rule 8 and what they first determine to be the bounds of\nproper joinder are of central importance. A broad interpretation of rule 8\nmeans broad joinder.”).\n\f11364               UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nformed part of a “common scheme or plan” to engage in\nimmigration fraud, and that the counts were of a “similar\ncharacter.”\n\n    1.   “Common Scheme or Plan”\n\n   We have not specifically defined the requisite nexus for a\n“common scheme or plan”; because the words are self-\ndefining, courts generally permit joinder under this test where\nthe counts “grow out of related transactions.” See Randazzo,\n80 F.3d at 627. Stated another way, we ask whether\n“[c]ommission of one of the offenses [ ]either depended upon\n[ ]or necessarily led to the commission of the other; proof of\nthe one act [ ]either constituted [ ]or depended upon proof of\nthe other.” United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 422, 429 (2d\nCir. 1978); see also United States v. Anderson, 642 F.2d 281,\n284 (9th Cir. 1981) (“When the joined counts are logically\nrelated, and there is a large area of overlapping proof, joinder\nis appropriate.”) (citing United States v. Roselli, 432 F.2d 879,\n899 (9th Cir. 1970)).\n\n   [3] Restricting our inquiry to the allegations in the super-\nceding indictment, nothing suggests such a nexus between the\ntwo counts. The document fraud count describes acts—\nknowingly making false statements on an asylum application\n— that were completed as of December 23, 2000. The mar-\nriage fraud conspiracy count describes very different acts—\nthe two meetings between Jawara and a “cooperating witness,\nidentified as P.C.”—that occurred several years later, on June\n24, 2004 and November 13, 2004. The document fraud charge\nmakes no reference to the “cooperating witness” that is cen-\ntral to the marriage fraud charge, and the marriage fraud\ncharge makes no reference to the asylum application that is\ncentral to the document fraud charge. Aside from the subject\nmatter of immigration, the superceding indictment does not\noffer a discernable link between the two offenses or suggest\nany overlapping evidence. No plan or common scheme links\nthe charges nor can any commonality be inferred from the\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11365\nindictment. See Terry, 911 F.2d at 276 (“No effort is made in\nthe indictment even to suggest that the offenses are . . . parts\nof a common scheme.”).\n\n   This case stands in marked contrast to situations where we\nhave determined that a “common scheme or plan” exists; such\ncases typically involve a concrete connection between the\noffenses that goes beyond mere thematic similarity. For\nexample, in United States v. Kinslow, 860 F.2d 963, 965 (9th\nCir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 829 (1989), overruled on\nother grounds by United States v. Brackeen, 969 F.2d 827,\n830 (9th Cir. 1992), a prison escapee forced a family at gun-\npoint to transport him across state lines and he then sexually\nmolested one of the children. We concluded that the charges\nof kidnaping, interstate transportation of a minor, unlawful\ntransportation of firearms, and stolen property were properly\njoined in the indictment because “[t]he incidents listed in the\nindictment all took place within the same 24 hour time period\nand they all made up part of Kinslow’s common plan to get\nto California with the . . . family as his hostages.” Id. at 966\n(emphasis added).\n\n   In a case involving joined counts of espionage and tax eva-\nsion, we held that the charges were part of a common plan or\nscheme even though they occurred at different times because\nthe “tax evasion flow[ed] directly from” the espionage activ-\nity and the tax evasion “result[ed] in large part from the\nnecessity of concealing the illegal proceeds of that activity.”\nUnited States v. Whitworth, 856 F.2d 1268, 1277 (9th Cir.\n1988) (emphasis added). In Whitworth, “the money allegedly\nreceived in exchange for classified information was the same\nas that involved in the tax charges,” a circumstance we distin-\nguished from Halper, a Second Circuit case deeming Medic-\naid fraud and tax evasion charges unconnected because “the\nsums charged in the income tax evasion indictment were not\nthe same funds embraced in the Medicaid fraud indictment.”\nId. (quoting Halper, 590 F.2d at 429).\n\f11366                 UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   [4] Here, there is no direct connection between the acts\nother than Jawara’s participation in both events. For example,\nthe false statements were not made to bolster or help conceal\nthe marriage fraud conspiracy, nor can it be said that the mar-\nriage fraud conspiracy flowed from the document fraud crime.\nAlthough a close temporal relationship is not, in and of itself,\na sufficient condition for joinder, see Cardwell, 433 F.3d at\n386, we consider it significant in this case that the alleged acts\nunderlying the two offenses had no temporal connection and\nwere separated by several years. “Whatever connection exists\nhere, it is entirely too speculative to justify joinder” on the\nbasis of a common scheme or plan. Halper, 590 F.2d at 429.\n\n      2.   “Same or Similar Character”\n\n   The more difficult question is the government’s alternate\nbasis for joinder— that the offenses are of a “similar charac-\nter” because they relate to immigration fraud. The “same or\nsimilar character” prong of Rule 8(a) is the most amorphous\nand controversial of the three grounds for joinder.6 Numerous\ncourts and commentators have questioned the logic and fair-\nness of such a rule. See e.g., Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 627 (“It is\nobvious why Congress provided for joinder of counts that\ngrow out of related transactions . . . ; the reasons for allowing\njoinder of offenses having ‘the same or similar character’ is\nless clear.”); Halper, 590 F.2d at 430 (“When all that can be\nsaid of two separate offenses is that they are of the ‘same or\nsimilar character,’ the customary justifications for joinder\n(efficiency and economy) largely disappear. . . . At the same\ntime, the risk to the defendant in such circumstances is con-\nsiderable.”); Note, Joint and Single Trials under Rule 8 and\n  6\n    The “same and similar” language, like all of Rule 8(a),“was intended\nby the Advisory Committee to be substantially a restatement of the law\napplied prior to adoption of the rules.” 1A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT,\nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 141 (3d ed. 1999); see also Randazzo,\n80 F.3d at 627, n.1. (“The ‘same or similar’ language was drawn from ear-\nlier law without explanation.”).\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11367\n14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 74 YALE L.\nJ. 553, 560 (1965) (recommending “abolition of joinder of\nsimilar offenses under Rule 8” given its “lack of utility” and\nrisk of prejudice to the defendant); 1A CHARLES ALAN\nWRIGHT, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 143 (3d ed.\n1999) (“Joinder on this ground poses obvious dangers of prej-\nudice to the defendant. . . . [I]t may fairly be asked whether\njoinder of this kind should ever be allowed. If the offenses\narise out of separate and unrelated transactions, there is likely\nto be little saving in time and money in having a single\ntrial.”).\n\n   [5] Mindful of these significant concerns, we turn to the\nmore immediate question: does the fact that the two offenses\nrelate to immigration fraud make them of a “similar charac-\nter” for joinder purposes? We have upheld initial joinder on\nthe basis of “similar character” in a handful of decisions. See,\ne.g., United States v. Rousseau, 257 F.3d 925, 932 (9th Cir.\n2001) (joinder of two counts of being a felon in possession of\na firearm); United States v. Fiorillo, 186 F.3d 1136, 1145 (9th\nCir. 1999) (per curiam) (joinder of charges relating to wire\nfraud, improper hazardous waste practices in violation of the\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act, and improper\nreceipt of explosives); United States v. Kaplan, 895 F.2d 618,\n621 (9th Cir. 1990) (joinder of counts relating to physician-\ndefendant’s controlled substance prescription practices and\nthe filing of false insurance claims); United States v. Bronco,\n597 F.2d 1300, 1301 (9th Cir. 1979) (joinder of counts of con-\nspiracy to sell counterfeit money, possession of counterfeit\nmoney, and passing counterfeit money); Edwards v. Squier,\n178 F.2d 758, 759 (9th Cir. 1949) (joinder of counts relating\nto transport of a stolen vehicle, in violation of the Motor\nVehicle Theft Act, and transport of stolen securities, in viola-\ntion of National Stolen Property Act, that occurred on the\nsame day). Aside from the general observation that “similar”\ncharacter does not mean the “same,” see Edwards, 178 F.2d\nat 759, we have offered little guidance in the application of\nthis test.\n\f11368               UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   “Same or similar character” cases often present a situation\nwhere “line drawing between permissible and improper join-\nder . . . becomes imprecise and the standards applied confus-\ning.” United States v. Buchanan, 930 F. Supp. 657, 662 (D.\nMass. 1996). This case underscores the importance of provid-\ning more clarity and texture for assessing the propriety of\njoinder on the basis of “same or similar character,” and we\nendeavor here to fill in some of the blanks.\n\n   Our analysis in Terry provides a useful jumping-off point,\nalthough there, the analysis of the “common scheme” and\n“similar character” prongs of Rule 8(a) is intertwined, making\nit difficult to discern the dividing line between the two. In\nrejecting the “similar character” of drug and firearm offenses\nin Terry, we considered a variety of factors, such as the differ-\nent dates and locations of the acts underlying the two counts.\nTerry, 911 F.2d at 276 (“Count I and II describe an event\noccurring on June 9, 1988 in San Joaquin County. Count III\ndescribes an event occurring on June 22, 1988 in another city\nand county. The drug crimes referred to in Counts I and II are\nwholly different from the possession of a firearm charge in\nCount III.”). We also considered the fact that the evidence\nnecessary to prove one offense was different from, and did\nnot overlap with, evidence necessary to prove the other\noffense. Id. Thus, we undertook a fairly broad inquiry based\non factors that were readily apparent on the face of the indict-\nment or could be reasonably inferred from the allegations in\nthe indictment.\n\n   Looking to our sister circuits for guidance in the assess-\nment of “same or similar character,” the First and Seventh\nCircuits have addressed this issue at some length. Although\nboth circuits focus the Rule 8(a) inquiry on allegations in the\nindictment, see United States v. Coleman, 22 F.3d 126, 134\n(7th Cir. 1994); United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 306\n(1st Cir. 1991), their respective approaches to “same or simi-\nlar character” represent two ends of the spectrum.\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                       11369\n   The Seventh Circuit has adopted a “literal” or “categorical”\napproach that pays almost exclusive attention to likeness of\n“class” or “category” of the offenses, Coleman, 22 F.3d at\n133-34, while the First Circuit utilizes what could be charac-\nterized as a broader, more holistic approach that looks to a\nvariety of factors, including temporal proximity and potential\nfor evidentiary overlap. Cf. United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d\n499, 503 (1st Cir. 1996).7\n\n   In Coleman, a case involving the joinder of four separate\nweapons possession charges that occurred on different dates,\nthe Seventh Circuit moved away from a “balancing of time\nand evidence factors” embodied in previous cases, in favor of\na “more literal reading of the Rule.” 22 F.3d at 134. The court\nwrote that the “same or similar character” language in Rule\n8(a) was a “rather clear directive to compare the offenses\ncharged for categorical, not evidentiary, similarities.” Id. at\n133. Acknowledging the “scant” evidentiary overlap and tem-\nporal proximity between the joined offenses, id. at 132, the\nSeventh Circuit in Coleman nevertheless upheld joinder:\n“[s]imply put, if offenses are of like class, although not con-\nnected temporally or evidentially, the requisites of proper\njoinder should be satisfied so far as Rule 8(a) is concerned.”\nId. at 133.\n  7\n    Some other circuits are less easily categorized. For example, Coleman\ncites a Fifth Circuit case, United States v. Holloway, 1 F.3d 307 (5th Cir.\n1993), as applying a similar “categorical” approach. Coleman, 22 F.3d at\n133-34. However, temporal proximity was a factor in the Fifth Circuit’s\nanalysis in Holloway. 1 F.3d at 310-11. In United States v. Werner, 620\nF.2d 922 (2d Cir. 1980), the Second Circuit seemed to lean toward a literal\ninterpretation of “similar character”: “Rule 8(a) is not limited to crimes of\nthe ‘same’ character but also covers those of ‘similar’ character, which\nmeans ‘(n) early corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat\nalike; having a general likeness.’ ” Id. at 926 (quoting WEBSTER’S NEW\nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (2d ed.)). Yet, reading Werner in conjunction\nwith Halper, the Second Circuit’s “same or similar” inquiry considers the\nextent of evidentiary overlap. See Halper, 590 F.2d at 431.\n\f11370               UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   In adopting this “categorical” framework, the Seventh Cir-\ncuit explained that such an approach is “most consistent with\nthe respective roles of Rule 8 and Rule 14.” Id. at 134.\nNamely, the initial joinder decision, based solely on the\nindictment, offers little “real insight into the actual mutual rel-\nevance of the individual offenses and their surrounding cir-\ncumstances, which only crystallizes with the presentation of\nevidence at trial.” Id. The Seventh Circuit concluded that the\n“natural product” of this limitation is “[a]n uncomplicated\ninquiry and review of initial joinder,” while an “examination\nof the nature of the evidence and ties between the acts under-\nlying the offenses” is best left to Rule 14 severance decisions\n—with the extra caution that district courts should be “espe-\ncially watchful for possible . . . sources of prejudice” in cases\nof “same or similar character” joinder. Id.\n\n   We recognize that the initial joinder inquiry under Rule 8,\nwhich is confined to allegations in the indictment, offers a\nmore limited opportunity for detailed analysis than its more\n“flexible” Rule 14 counterpart. Id.; see also Terry, 911 F.2d\nat 277 (explaining that a Rule 14 motion to sever, unlike a\nRule 8 motion, “must be renewed at the close of evidence or\nit is waived,” so that the district court can “assess whether a\njoinder is prejudicial at a time when the evidence is fully\ndeveloped . . .”) (internal quotations and citation omitted). We\nare nonetheless uncomfortable with a Rule 8 “same or similar\ncharacter” inquiry that wholly ignores factors relevant to the\nquestion of similarity, such as temporal proximity, physical\nlocation, modes of operation, identity of the victims, likeli-\nhood of evidentiary overlap, and the like, to the extent that\nthey can be gleaned from the indictment. The Seventh Cir-\ncuit’s “categorical” approach, aside from instructing district\ncourts to eyeball the indictment for offenses of a “like class”\nand encouraging vigilant scrutiny in the Rule 14 context,\noffers little guidance in close cases. Depending on the level\nof abstraction (e.g., offenses involving dishonesty, offenses\ninvolving an intent to defraud), offenses of a “like class”\nmight encompass a host of otherwise unrelated offenses, mak-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11371\ning an “uncomplicated” similar character inquiry tantamount\nto no meaningful inquiry. And any “extra layer” of protection\nprovided by Rule 14 “does not relieve the trial court [or a\nreviewing court] of its responsibility to ensure that joinder is\nproper in the first instance.” Buchanan, 930 F. Supp. at 662\nn.14. Although the “like class” standard provides a useful\nbenchmark, in our view it is too limiting and does not com-\nport with our more expansive inquiry in Terry.\n\n   Our analysis in Terry more closely corresponds to the First\nCircuit’s comprehensive review and its “consider[ation] [of]\nsuch factors as ‘whether the charges are laid under the same\nstatute, whether they involve similar victims, locations, or\nmodes or operation, and the time frame in which the charged\nconduct occurred.’ ” Edgar, 82 F.3d at 503 (quoting United\nStates v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973 (1st Cir. 1995)) (holding\nthat workers’ compensation and insurance fraud counts were\n“sufficiently similar” because they involved the same modus\noperandi, the timing overlapped, and the evidence would also\noverlap). This framework also considers the “extent of com-\nmon evidence,” particularly, “the important evidence.” Ran-\ndazzo, 80 F.3d at 628 (“Congress did not provide for joinder\nfor unrelated transactions . . . merely because some evidence\nmight be common to all of the counts.”).\n\n   [6] We consider it appropriate to consider factors such as\nthe elements of the statutory offenses, the temporal proximity\nof the acts, the likelihood and extent of evidentiary overlap,\nthe physical location of the acts, the modus operandi of the\ncrimes, and the identity of the victims in assessing whether an\nindictment meets the “same or similar character” prong of\nRule 8(a). The weight given to a particular factor will depend\non the specific context of the case and the allegations in the\nindictment. But the bottom line is that the similar character of\nthe joined offenses should be ascertainable—either readily\napparent or reasonably inferred—from the face of the indict-\nment. Courts should not have to engage in inferential gymnas-\ntics or resort to implausible levels of abstraction to divine\n\f11372                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nsimilarity. Thus, where the government seeks joinder of\ncounts on the basis of “same or similar character,” it crafts a\nbarebones indictment at its own risk.\n\n   [7] Applying this inquiry to the indictment here, it is appar-\nent that the two counts are not of the “same or similar charac-\nter.” The indictment alleges two different statutory violations\nrequiring proof of different elements.8 The underlying acts\nalleged in the indictment are separated by three-and-a-half\nyears, a temporal distance that is not bridged by the “exact\ntime unknown” language appearing at the start of the mar-\nriage fraud charge. The lack of any temporal connection is all\nthe more significant because the counts do not stem from\ncommon events. As for potential evidentiary overlap, Peter\nColeman, the cooperating witness whose centrality to the\nmarriage fraud charge is obvious from the indictment, is nota-\nbly absent from the document fraud charge; nor is any other\nevidentiary link ascertainable from the indictment. The indict-\nment evinces no similar mode of operation with respect to the\ntwo crimes—lying about being from Sierra Leone on an asy-\nlum application is vastly different from facilitating or procur-\n  8\n  18 U.S.C. § 1546, “Fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other docu-\nments,” provides, in relevant part:\n      Whoever knowingly makes under oath, or as permitted under\n      penalty of perjury . . . knowingly subscribes as true, any false\n      statement with respect to a material fact in any application, affi-\n      davit, or other document required by the immigration laws or reg-\n      ulations prescribed thereunder, or knowingly presents any such\n      application, affidavit, or other document which contains any such\n      false statement or which fails to contain any reasonable basis in\n      law or fact—\n      Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned . . .\n      8 U.S.C. § 1325, “Improper entry by alien,” provides, in relevant\n      part:\n      Any individual who knowingly enters into a marriage for the pur-\n      pose of evading any provision of the immigration laws shall be\n      imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or fined not more than\n      $250,000, or both.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11373\ning meetings with prospective marriage candidates. The\ncounts do not involve related geographic locations or related\nvictims of the fraud. Ultimately, the only similarity discern-\nible from the indictment is that both counts involve immigra-\ntion. Such a “vague thematic connection” cannot, in and of\nitself, justify joinder. Buchanan, 930 F. Supp. at 662.\n\n   If subject matter similarity alone were sufficient, wholly\nunrelated charges for threatening an immigration officer upon\ninitial entry to the United States and participating in an alien\nsmuggling operation several years later could be deemed to be\nof the “same or similar character.” Or, in the drug context,\nconsider the example of a pharmacist who sells, over the\ncounter, unlawful amounts of products containing pseu-\ndoephedrine and then, some years later, buys cocaine from a\ngovernment informant. Both crimes involve drugs and a drug-\ngist, but surely such a general thematic commonality does not\nmake the offenses of the “same or similar character.” To\nextend the rule so broadly would lead to absurd results and\nrender the “same or similar” test without meaningful limits.\n\n   [8] Even under the Seventh Circuit’s “like class” test, we\ndo not view these two immigration violations as being of “like\nclass.” The immigration document fraud charge is, in essence,\na perjury claim related to Jawara’s national origin. The other\ncharge stems from an arrangement to facilitate sham mar-\nriages. The proof is in the framing. We interpret “similar” to\nmean something beyond facial similarity of subject matter.\nLooking at the allegations in the indictment, including any\nreasonable inferences of the connections and similarities that\nmay be drawn about these two counts, we hold that the counts\ndo not qualify as “same or similar” under Rule 8.\n\n    3.   Actual Prejudice\n\n  [9] According to the Supreme Court, our inquiry does not\nend here. “A violation of Rule 8 ‘requires reversal only if the\nmisjoinder results in actual prejudice because it had a substan-\n\f11374                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\ntial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s\nverdict.’ ” Terry, 911 F.2d at 277 (quoting United States v.\nLane, 474 U.S. 438, 449 (1986)). This standard, though “ex-\nacting,” Rousseau, 257 F.3d at 932, is less exacting than Rule\n14’s “manifest prejudice” standard. See United States v.\nLewis, 787 F.2d 1318, 1321 (9th Cir. 1986) (Under Rule 14,\n“[t]he defendant has the burden of proving that the joint trial\nwas manifestly prejudicial,” such that “defendant’s right to a\nfair trial was abridged.”). In any case, we will not presume\nthat “prejudice results whenever [Rule 8’s] requirements have\nnot been satisfied.” Lane, 474 U.S. at 449.\n\n   In Lane, the Supreme Court considered a variety of factors\nin resolving that misjoinder under Rule 8 did not have a “sub-\nstantial and injurious” effect on the jury’s verdict, including\nthe “overwhelming evidence of guilt shown,” the provision of\na “proper limiting instruction . . . admonish[ing] the jury to\nconsider each count and defendant separately,” and the likeli-\nhood that evidence admitted on the misjoined count would\nhave been admissible in a separate trial as evidence of intent\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).9 Id. at 450. The Court\nalso refused to “necessarily assume that the jury misunder-\nstood or disobeyed” the district court’s limiting instruction,\nand noted that the evidence as to one count “was distinct and\neasily segregated from evidence” relating to the other counts.\nId. at 450 n. 13.\n\n  [10] After carefully reviewing the trial record as a whole,\nwe are comfortable in our analysis that misjoinder did not\n  9\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides:\n      Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\n      prove the character of a person in order to show action in confor-\n      mity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other pur-\n      poses, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n      plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, pro-\n      vided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a crim-\n      inal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial . . . .\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA               11375\nhave a “substantial and injurious” effect on the verdict. A\nnumber of factors support this conclusion. We begin with the\nfact that the district court instructed the jury to treat the\ncharges separately: “A separate crime is charged against the\ndefendant in each count. You must decide each count sepa-\nrately. Your verdict as to one count should not control your\nverdict on any other count.” That “the district court specifi-\ncally instructed the jury that it was obliged to consider the\ncounts separately . . . . militates against a finding of preju-\ndice.” Rousseau, 257 F.3d at 932; see also Fiorillo, 186 F.3d\nat 1145 (explaining that even if misjoinder occurred, the\ncourt’s jury instruction “to deliberate on the elements of each\ncharge separately . . . . militates against a finding of preju-\ndice”).\n\n   [11] In addition, the evidence of guilt was overwhelming as\nto both counts. See Lane, 474 U.S. at 450 (“In the face of\noverwhelming evidence of guilt shown here, we are satisfied\nthat the [misjoinder] was harmless.”). The recorded meetings\nand Coleman’s testimony conclusively demonstrated Jawara’s\nparticipation in the marriage fraud conspiracy. Jawara’s credi-\nbility was not a central issue as he was hard pressed to dis-\navow the recorded admissions. As for the document fraud\ncharge, Jawara admitted numerous falsehoods in his applica-\ntion and acknowledged providing the two Sierra Leonean\nidentity documents to Ali, which Bayer-Broring testified were\ncounterfeit. To the extent that Jawara’s credibility was an\nimportant factor in the document fraud conviction, his own\ntestimony consisted of numerous credibility-eroding admis-\nsions, including his repeated use of his Gambian cousin’s\nname and passport to secure various identity documents in the\nUnited States.\n\n   Given the strength of the individual cases, we do not con-\nfront a situation where prejudice might stem from a disparity\nof evidence—i.e., a weak case joined with a strong case. See,\ne.g., Bean v. Calderon, 163 F.3d 1073, 1085 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(explaining that “prejudice resulted from the disparity\n\f11376               UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nbetween the evidence supporting his guilt” as to each of the\njoined offenses); Lucero v. Kerby, 133 F.3d 1299, 1315 (10th\nCir. 1998) (“Courts have recognized that the joinder of\noffenses in a single trial may be prejudicial when there is a\ngreat disparity in the amount of evidence underlying the\njoined offenses.”).\n\n   [12] Finally, for many of the same reasons that we deter-\nmined the charges are not similar—the differences in applica-\nble statute, modes of operation, evidence, and time frame—\nthe jury likewise would have had no difficulty distinguishing\nbetween the charges and the evidence. Although it is gener-\nally “much more difficult for jurors to compartmentalize dam-\naging information about one defendant derived from joined\ncounts, than it is to compartmentalize evidence against sepa-\nrate defendants joined for trial,” Lewis, 787 F.2d at 1322\n(citation omitted), “the jury was not likely in this case to con-\nfuse which count particular evidence was introduced to estab-\nlish.” United States v. Johnson, 820 F.2d 1065, 1071 (9th Cir.\n1987). The issues in this four-day trial were relatively simple,\nand the evidence central to the document fraud count—the\nasylum application, the Sierra Leonean identity documents\nand Bayer-Broring’s testimony—was distinct and easily seg-\nregated from evidence central to the marriage fraud count—\nthe recordings and Coleman’s testimony. See, e.g., Lane, 474\nU.S. at 450, n. 13 (noting that misjoinder error was harmless,\nin part, because “the evidence as to [the counts] was distinct\nand easily segregated”).\n\n   In claiming prejudice as a result of the joinder, Jawara\noffers the general assertion that “evidence of alleged material\nmisstatements in an asylum application would not have been\nadmissible against [him] in a separate trial on the charge of\nconspiracy to commit marriage fraud, and vice versa.” We\nhave observed that one of the ways that joinder of offenses\nmay prejudice a defendant is that “the jury may use the evi-\ndence of one of the crimes charged to infer a criminal disposi-\ntion on the part of the defendant from which is found his guilt\n\f                       UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                       11377\nof the other crime or crimes charged.” Johnson, 820 F.2d at\n1070 (quoting Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85, 88 (D.C.\nCir. 1964)). Jawara does not point to any specific “inadmissi-\nble” evidence in support of this assertion. Even if some of the\nevidence would not have been cross-admissible in separate\ntrials, it is likely that the jury was able to “compartmentalize\nthe evidence” in light of the other factors we have described.\nThus, in this case, evidence related to one crime did not likely\n“taint the jury’s consideration” of the other crime. Johnson,\n820 F.2d at 1071; see also Bean, 163 F.3d at 1085\n(“[P]rejudice generally does not arise from joinder when the\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct, even in the\nabsence of cross-admissibility [of the evidence].”); Drew, 331\nF.2d at 91 (“The federal courts, including our own, have,\nhowever, found no prejudicial effect from joinder when the\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct, even though\nsuch evidence might not have been admissible in separate tri-\nals . . . .”).\n\n   [13] In the absence of prejudice, reversal is not required.\nSince Jawara has not established that he was prejudiced by the\nviolation of Rule 8, he cannot satisfy the burden of demon-\nstrating “manifest prejudice” under Rule 14.\n\nII.    REMAINING CLAIMS\n\n  We briefly address Jawara’s remaining claims, although\nnone warrants reversal.10\n\n  A.    MOTION TO SUPPRESS\n\n   We review de novo Jawara’s argument that the district\n  10\n     We note that Jawara does not raise a cumulative error claim. See\nUnited States v. Ullah, 976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1992) (“We ‘will not\nordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and dis-\ntinctly argued in appellant’s opening brief.’ ”) (quoting Miller v. Fairchild\nIndustries, Inc., 797 F.2d 727, 738 (9th Cir. 1986)).\n\f11378              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\ncourt should have suppressed the documents seized during the\nsearch of his residence because of an alleged material omis-\nsion in paragraph 42 of Agent Smalley’s search warrant affi-\ndavit. United States v. Murillo, 255 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.\n2001). This paragraph reads:\n\n    I began working on this case after determining that\n    an individual calling himself Haji JAWARA may\n    also be known as Mohamed JAWARA. It was\n    believed that he was using a false identity and that\n    he was originally from The Gambia but claimed to\n    be from Sierra Leone in order to obtain immigration\n    status.\n\nJawara contends that Agent Smalley’s failure to include the\nsource of the information in this recitation negates the affida-\nvit’s facial showing of probable cause.\n\n   “A search warrant, to be valid, must be supported by an\naffidavit establishing probable cause.” United States v. Sta-\nnert, 762 F.2d 775, 778 (9th Cir. 1985). In Stanert, we applied\nthe rationale of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), to\nhold that a defendant could challenge a facially valid affidavit\nby making a substantial preliminary showing that “the affiant\nintentionally or recklessly omitted facts required to prevent\ntechnically true statements in the affidavit from being mis-\nleading.” Stanert, 762 F.2d at 781 (“By reporting less than the\ntotal story, an affiant can manipulate the inferences a magis-\ntrate will draw. To allow a magistrate to be misled in such a\nmanner could denude the probable cause requirement of all\nreal meaning.”). In addition, the defendant must show that the\n“affidavit, once corrected and supplemented,” would not\n“provide . . . a substantial basis for concluding that probable\ncause existed” to search defendant’s residence. Id. at 782.\nJawara fails, in several respects, to make this showing.\n\n  Jawara fails to show how the alleged omission was\n“material”—i.e., how it caused technically true statements in\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11379\nthe affidavit to be misleading. The first sentence of the dis-\nputed paragraph—“I began working on this case after deter-\nmining that an individual calling himself Haji JAWARA may\nalso be known as Mohamed JAWARA”—indicates that\nAgent Smalley is the source of the information in this para-\ngraph. Although the second sentence—“It was believed that\nhe was using a false identity . . .” —does not indicate a spe-\ncific source, it is unclear how this omission is material when\nread in the context of the first sentence and the dozen para-\ngraphs following it, which describe in excruciating detail how\nAgent Smalley discovered that “Mohamed” and “Haji” were\nthe same person based on his comparison of photographs,\ndriver licenses, and other documents, and his discovery of\ncontradictory immigration documents submitted under both\nnames.\n\n   [14] Jawara also fails to make any showing, let alone “a\nsubstantial showing” that this omission of source was “delib-\nerate or reckless.” Id. at 781. In his briefs, Jawara offers only\nthe observation that “[o]ne cannot determine whether that\nomission was deliberate or reckless.” Nor does Jawara dem-\nonstrate that the affidavit, when supplemented with the omit-\nted information, would be insufficient to support a probable\ncause finding. Id. at 782. Thus, the district court did not err\nin denying Jawara’s suppression motion.\n\n  B.   DAUBERT HEARING\n\n   The district court denied Jawara’s request for a pre-trial\nDaubert hearing to determine the reliability of Bayer-\nBroring’s expert testimony. District courts have a general\n“gatekeeping” duty to ensure that proffered expert testimony\n“both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task\nat hand.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597. This obligation does not,\nhowever, require the court to hold a separate Daubert hearing.\nUnited States v. Alatorre, 222 F.3d 1098, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(“Nowhere . . . does the Supreme Court mandate the form that\nthe inquiry into reliability and relevance must take . . . .”).\n\f11380               UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   [15] The district court admitted Bayer-Broring’s testimony\nafter reviewing briefs and other materials relating to the in\nlimine motion and hearing lengthy oral argument from both\ncounsel. Bayer-Broring’s qualifications included a master’s\ndegree in Forensic Science, a certification in forensic docu-\nment examination, and experience in over 700 document\nexaminations, including 50-60 examinations of documents\nallegedly from Sierra Leone. The district court stated only:\n“The testimony will be allowed, and the Court finds that a\nDaubert hearing is unnecessary.” Although the district court’s\nruling suggests an implicit finding of reliability, the failure to\nmake an explicit reliability finding was error. Mukhtar v. Cal-\nifornia State University, 299 F.3d 1053, 1066 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(“[T]he only indication we have that the district court found\n[the expert’s] testimony reliable is the fact that it was admit-\nted . . . . Surely Daubert and its progeny require more.”).\nNonetheless, in light of Bayer-Boring’s extensive academic\nqualifications and experience and the relevance and value of\nher testimony to the jury, the “proffered testimony otherwise\nsatisfie[d] the requirements for admission.” United States v.\nRahm, 993 F.2d 1405, 1412 (9th Cir. 1993). The lack of an\nexplicit finding of reliability was harmless. See United States\nv. Figueroa-Lopez 125 F.3d 1241, 1247 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(“Given this background, we are certain [the expert] was qual-\nified to deliver the opinion testimony disputed in this case,\nand the failure formally to go through the usual process—\nalthough an error—was clearly harmless.”).\n\n  C.     OTHER EVIDENTIARY CHALLENGES\n\n    1.    Agent Smalley’s Testimony\n\n   Agent Smalley testified about the comparative country con-\nditions in Sierra Leone and The Gambia and the location of\nthe Maraka tribe in The Gambia, testimony Jawara challenges\nas inadmissible hearsay and a violation of his Sixth Amend-\nment right to confrontation. In addition, Jawara challenges the\nrelevance of Agent Smalley’s testimony regarding the relative\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11381\nnumber of asylum applications from natives of Sierra Leone\nand The Gambia. We review the evidentiary claims for abuse\nof discretion, Rahm, 993 F.2d at 1410, and the constitutional\nclaim for plain error because Jawara failed to object on Con-\nfrontation Clause grounds. See United States v. Allen, 425\nF.3d 1231, 1235 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n   In his briefs, Jawara appears to concede that Agent Smalley\nwas a qualified expert witness on immigration and asylum\nmatters. Agent Smalley’s testimony regarding comparative\ncountry conditions, founded on State Department country\nreports, was properly admitted because these reports are “of\na type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field\nin forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,” Fed. R.\nEvid. 703, and the probative value of the underlying data out-\nweighed any prejudicial effect it might have had on the jury.\nSee Turner v. Burlington N. Santa Fe R.R. Co., 338 F.3d\n1058, 1061 (9th Cir. 2003). That defense counsel had “ample\nopportunity to cross-examine [Agent Smalley] about his\nexpert opinion, and the sources of information upon which\nthat opinion was based . . . is a sufficient basis upon which\nto reject [Jawara’s] confrontation clause argument.” United\nStates v. Beltran-Rios, 878 F.2d 1208, 1213 (9th Cir. 1989).\n\n   Although the record does not reveal whether the computer\nindices Agent Smalley relied upon in testifying about the\nlocation of the Maraka tribe were “of a type reasonably relied\nupon by experts in the particular field,” Fed. R. Evid. 703, the\ndistrict court’s admission of this testimony was harmless. The\nonly effect of this testimony was to demonstrate that the asy-\nlum application contained inconsistencies and false state-\nments, a fact Jawara readily admitted in his own testimony.\nJawara’s only defense was that he never read the application.\nDuring cross examination, defense counsel effectively ques-\ntioned Agent Smalley about this testimony and elicited a\nresponse favorable to Jawara that a member of this tribe could\nrelocate to another area without losing his ethnic or tribal des-\nignation.\n\f11382                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   [16] Similarly, although we doubt the relevance of Agent\nSmalley’s testimony regarding the relative number of asylum\napplications filed by natives of Sierra Leone and The Gambia,\nthe admission of that testimony was harmless. “[I]t is more\nprobable than not that the error did not materially affect the\nverdict.” Rahm, 993 F.2d at 1415.\n\n        2.   Gambian School Examination Records\n\n   The district court admitted into evidence two Gambian\nschool examination records, Exhibits 16.2 and 16.3. The gov-\nernment contends that these documents were properly admit-\nted as foreign business records. See 18 U.S.C. § 3505. Jawara\nargues that § 3505 does not support the admission of these\ndocuments, and that they should have been excluded on hear-\nsay and authenticity grounds.\n\n   “Pursuant to § 3505, ‘[i]n a criminal proceeding . . . , a for-\neign record of regularly conducted activity, or a copy of such\nrecord, shall not be excluded as evidence by the hearsay rule\nif a foreign certification attests’ ” to the requirements set forth\nin § 3505(a)(1)(A)-(D).11 United States v. Hagege, 437 F.3d\n943, 956 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3505(a)(1)). A\nforeign certification under this section also “serves to authen-\nticate the foreign records, and thus ‘dispenses with the neces-\nsity of calling a live witness to establish authenticity.’ ” Id. at\n957 (quoting United States v. Sturman, 951 F.2d 1466, 1489\n  11\n    Section 3505(a)(1) requires the foreign certification to attest that:\n       (A) such record was made, at or near the time of the occurrence\n       of the matters set forth, by (or from information transmitted by)\n       a person with knowledge of those matters; (B) such record was\n       kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity; (C)\n       the business activity made such a record as a regular practice; and\n       (D) if such record is not the original, such record is a duplicate\n       of the original; unless the source of information or the method or\n       circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\n18 U.S.C. § 3505(a)(1).\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11383\n(6th Cir. 1991)). Congress enacted § 3505 not “to add techni-\ncal roadblocks to the admission of foreign records, but, rather,\nto streamline the admission of such records.” United States v.\nStrickland, 935 F.2d 822, 831 (7th Cir. 1991). “Further,\n§ 3505 did not change the benchmark question in this and\nevery situation involving the admission of documentary evi-\ndence: do the documents bear the indicia of reliability?” Id.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting\nExhibits 16.2 and 16.3.\n\n   Exhibit 16.2 is a “Statement of Examination Result” for\n“Candidate Name: Muhammed Jawara” from the West Afri-\ncan Examinations Council. The document contains a stamp\nimprint from the “West African Examinations Council” and\nreads, in relevant part:\n\n    This is to certify that according to records in this\n    Office MUHAMMED JAWARA took The West\n    African Senior School Certificate Examination in\n    May/June 1998 at the St. Augustine’s Senior Sec-\n    ondary School as candidate No. 8010002152.\n\nThat statement, along with “details of [Jawara’s] [exam] per-\nformance” in several subjects, are incorporated into a letter\nfrom the Council dated “17th February 2005.” The letter, in\nturn, is attached to an attestation by Abraham Jouf, the head\nof the Test Development Department.\n\n   [17] Jawara argues that this attestation failed to meet the\nrequirements of § 3505(a)(1)(A)-(D). Although Jouf’s attesta-\ntion does not mirror the exact language of § 3505(a)(1), it sat-\nisfies the statutory requirements in substance—the\ncertification confirms the accuracy of the test records main-\ntained in the files of the examination agency. Because the dis-\nputed document contains sufficient indicia of reliability, the\ndistrict court was within its discretion to admit the document.\nWe also note that the information contained in this exhibit is,\n\f11384                 UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nin any case, duplicative of Exhibit 16.3, which falls squarely\nwithin the purview of § 3505.\n\n   Exhibit 16.3 lists “May/June 1998” examination results for\nstudents from “St. Augustine’s Senior Secondary School” in\nBanjul, The Gambia, including “Jawara Muhammed.” It con-\ntains the heading “The West African Examinations Council”\nand has a stamp imprint from the “Principal” of St. Augus-\ntine’s. This document is accompanied by a “Certificate of\nAuthenticity of Business Records,” signed on January 14,\n2005 by Charles Mendy, who attested on penalty of perjury\nthat he is the principal of St. Augustine’s. Mendy’s attestation\ncontains language exactly mirroring § 3505(a)(1)(A)-(D).\n\n   Notably, at the in limine hearing, Jawara’s attorney initially\nacknowledged that the exhibit satisfied the statutory require-\nments: “[E]xhibit 16.3 . . . this is one exhibit from St. Augus-\ntine’s which does seem to be covered by the certification. The\ncertification certainly tracks the language of the statute . . . .”\nJawara later claimed that § 3505 does not support the admis-\nsion of Exhibit 16.3 because the principal of St. Augustine’s\ncannot attest to an examination record prepared by the West\nAfrican Examinations Council. This argument is without\nmerit.\n\n   [18] Section 3505 provides for a “foreign certification” by\n“the custodian of a foreign record of regularly conducted\nactivity or another qualified person.” 18 U.S.C. § 3505(c)(2)\n(emphasis added). As the school’s principal, Mendy was a\nproper “custodian” of official examination records for stu-\ndents attending his school. See United States v. Basey, 613\nF.2d 198, 202 n.1. (9th Cir. 1979) (holding no error in admit-\nting college records where “a sufficient custodian” had\nattested to the fact that “the records were made and kept in the\nregular course of college business,” and it was “unimportant\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)[12] that the custodian did not her-\n  12\n    See United States v. Klinzing, 315 F.3d 803, 810 (7th Cir. 2003)\n(explaining that “the foreign business records exception, § 3505, derived\nspecifically from . . . [Fed. R. Evid.] 803(6).”).\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11385\nself record the information or know who recorded the infor-\nmation.”). Borrowing the district court’s analogy, we would\nhave no trouble concluding that a college in the United States\nwas a proper custodian of its students’ SAT results, even\nthough the SAT results were actually prepared by another\nentity.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the judgment:\n\n   I join much of the majority opinion, but disagree that the\nmisjoinder of the indictment is harmless error. I would hold\nthat erroneously joining the two counts — falsifying one’s\nown immigration documents, and conspiring over a substan-\ntial period of time to aid other persons to enter into fraudulent\nmarriages in violation of the immigration laws — had a “sub-\nstantial and injurious effect” upon the jury’s determination.\nUnited States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449 (1986).\n\n   Although the majority characterizes the evidence of guilt\nunder both counts as “overwhelming,” Maj. at 11375, the evi-\ndence with respect to the falsification of the defendant’s own\nimmigration documents is clearly not. Jawara never denied\nthat there were material errors in his asylum application. To\nthe contrary, he acknowledged the errors in the application,\nbut testified that he was not aware of their existence because\nanother individual prepared the document for him. He also\ntestified that he was unaware of any problems regarding the\nsupporting documents and that he had received the identifica-\ntion card from a government office and his birth certificate\nfrom his brother in Sierra Leone. The crucial issue with\nrespect to the document fraud charge, thus, was Jawara’s\ncredibility. Although the government presented an expert wit-\nness whose testimony rendered some of Jawara’s testimony\n\f11386              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nimplausible, if the jury nevertheless believed his explanations\nit would have acquitted him on that charge.\n\n   In the vast majority of cases, and especially in cases in\nwhich a defendant’s credibility is the crucial issue, the most\nprejudicial evidence the prosecution can present — perhaps\naside from a confession — is testimony establishing that the\ndefendant has committed other serious crimes and is a bad\nperson generally. Evidence of other crimes is particularly\ndamning when the other crimes, as in this case, are of the\nsame general type (here, immigration offenses) as the offense\nwith which the defendant is charged. Here, it is plain not only\nthat Jawara’s credibility was undermined, but that his entire\ndefense to the document fraud charge was destroyed when the\nprosecution was allowed not only to inform, but to persuade,\nthe jury that following his own immigration violations Jawara\nengaged in a course of criminal conduct in violation of the\nimmigration laws — that he engaged in a continuous pattern\nof immigration fraud in aiding others to arrange fraudulent\nmarriages to circumvent the immigration statutes. Once the\njury reached its conclusion that Jawara had committed the\nserious criminal offense of conspiring over an extended\nperiod of time to aid others to fraudulently violate the immi-\ngration laws, so that they would become eligible to remain in\nthe United States, it was almost inevitable that it would\nbelieve that Jawara violated the immigration laws with respect\nto his own immigration papers so that he would be able to\nremain here. The case with respect to Jawara’s unlawful aid\nto others having been proven, it is unreasonable to expect that\nthe jury would consider the question of Jawara’s falsification\nof his own documents solely on the evidence relative to that\ncount. Persuading the jury of Jawara’s guilt on the more seri-\nous conspiracy charge eliminated any real possibility that it\nwould accept his contention that he was unaware of the mis-\nrepresentations in his own application and the errors in his\nother documents.\n\n  Prejudice can arise even more readily than in the average\ncase when there is misjoinder of a crime that would be partic-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11387\nularly disturbing to the average juror. Conspiring to violate\nthe immigration laws by aiding a number of aliens to remain\nin the country unlawfully and obtain permanent resident status\nwould be highly offensive to many jurors these days. In\nUnited States v. Terry, 911 F.2d 272 (9th Cir. 1990), a leading\ncase on misjoinder, we held that the district court erred under\nRule 8(a) in joining two drug-related charges with a count of\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm. We concluded that\nthe misjoinder prejudiced the defendant:\n\n    A juror would inevitably be more disturbed about the\n    idea of a “drug dealer” with a gun than a citizen who\n    previously had committed some unknown crime. It\n    is highly probable that this inculpatory characteriza-\n    tion of Terry as a drug dealer influenced the jury in\n    determining its verdict.\n\nId. at 277. Similarly, here, the jury likely was influenced, in\ndetermining whether Jawara was guilty of submitting his own\nfraudulent immigration document, by its conclusion that he\nhad in fact conspired to commit immigration fraud to aid oth-\ners over an extended period of time.\n\n   Furthermore, a “substantial disparity” in the strength of the\nevidence of two separate offenses which are joined can\n“taint[ ] the jury’s consideration” of the offense for which\nthere is weaker evidence. Bean v. Calderon, 163 F.3d 1073,\n1085 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing Lucero v. Kerby, 133 F.3d 1299,\n1315 (10th Cir. 1998)). By hearing far stronger evidence on\nthe conspiracy charge than the document fraud charge, the\njury may have experienced “ ‘the human tendency to draw a\nconclusion which is impermissible in the law: because he did\nit before, he must have done it again.’ ” Id. (quoting United\nStates v. Bagley, 772 F.2d 482, 488 (9th Cir. 1985)).\n\n   Although the majority relies heavily on its technical argu-\nments that the district court’s error was mitigated by the\ninstruction that the jury consider the counts separately, Maj.\n\f11388              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nat 11374-75, and that the jury could compartmentalize the evi-\ndence as to each charge, these factors, while not irrelevant,\nare hardly sufficient to overcome the overwhelming actual\nprejudice created in this case by joinder with the conspiracy\ncharge.\n\n   For these reasons, I would find the improper joinder preju-\ndicial, at least with respect to the document fraud charge.\nAccordingly, I dissent from the majority’s holding that there\nwas no prejudice in this case.\n\f",

Haji Jawara) appeals from his\nconvictions for document fraud related to his personal asylum\napplication and conspiracy to commit marriage fraud to avoid\nthe immigration laws. Jawara challenges the district court’s\ndenial of his motions to sever the two counts, to suppress\nphysical evidence, and to conduct a pre-trial hearing address-\ning the reliability of expert testimony, as well as various evi-\ndentiary rulings by the district court. We focus primarily on\nJawara’s claim of misjoinder and clarify the framework for\nassessing whether the joined offenses are of the “same or sim-\nilar character” under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a).\nLooking to the indictment, we conclude that the two counts\nare unrelated in nature and purpose, temporal scope, physical\nlocation, modes of operation, and key evidence. To suggest\nthat joinder is proper simply because each involves an immi-\ngration matter would stretch the “same or similar character”\nbasis for joinder beyond reasonable limits. Although we hold\nthat the counts were in fact misjoined, error does not warrant\nreversal in this case. Nor did the district court commit revers-\nible error with respect to the other matters challenged by\nJawara. We affirm the convictions.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n\n  In December 2000, “Haji Jawara” executed Immigration\nand Naturalization Service form I-589, an application for\n\f11356              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nasylum and withholding of removal. In this application, he\nclaimed, among other things, to be a native of Sierra Leone\nand a member of the Maraka tribe who had suffered imprison-\nment and witnessed the killing of his parents at the hands of\nrebels in Sierra Leone. The asylum application was prepared\nby a man who called himself “Mohamed Ali.” Copies of two\nidentity documents were attached to the asylum application:\na Republic of Sierra Leone identity card and a “Death Certifi-\ncate” purportedly issued by the Ministry of Health of the\nRepublic of Sierra Leone. Although the “Death Certificate”\nwas apparently submitted to certify Haji Jawara’s birth in\nSierra Leone, the certificate, in fact, stated that Haji Jawara\n“died 4th July 1979 at 6:45 p.m. at Kono Government Hospi-\ntal” in Sierra Leone.\n\n   Three years later, Darrick Smalley, a senior special agent\nwith Immigration and Customs Enforcement, began investi-\ngating the activities of “Mohamed Jawara,” as part of a larger\ninvestigation involving several individuals. During the course\nof his investigation, Agent Smalley discovered that “Mo-\nhamed Jawara” was also using the name “Haji Jawara,” and\nthat in 1999, “Mohamed Jawara” had submitted applications\nfor a visa and a social security number, in which he claimed\nThe Gambia as his birthplace and provided his Gambian pass-\nport.\n\n   The following year, while this investigation was still pend-\ning, Jawara approached his friend Peter Coleman for help in\nfinding a citizen to marry his friend “Ibrahim” for immigra-\ntion purposes. Coleman, unbeknownst to Jawara, was a paid\ninformant who had assisted federal law enforcement authori-\nties in several cases since his own arrest in 2001. In June\n2004, Coleman met Jawara and Ibrahim at a coffee shop and\nintroduced them to Carol, a prospective marriage candidate.\nThey discussed the mechanics of a potential sham marriage,\nincluding housing and living arrangements. Coleman wore a\nrecording device during this meeting, and federal agents,\nincluding Agent Smalley, monitored the meeting and took\n\f                   UNITED STATES v.

Some months later, Coleman had another meet-\ning with Jawara, also recorded, at which Jawara sought Cole-\nman’s help in finding a wife for himself.\n\n   In November 2004, law enforcement officials arrested\nJawara and executed a search warrant at his apartment, where\nthey recovered various documents, including his Sierra Leone\nidentity card and death certificate. A grand jury indicted\nJawara on one count of fraud related to immigration docu-\nments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a), and one count of\nconspiracy to commit marriage fraud, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 371 and 8 U.S.C. § 1325.\n\n  The document fraud charge read, in pertinent part:\n\n    On or about December 23, 2000, . . . MOHAMED\n    JAWARA, aka: HAJI JAWARA, did knowingly\n    make false statements under oath, and . . . knowingly\n    subscribed as true, false statements with respect to a\n    material fact in an application . . . required by the\n    immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereun-\n    der, and knowingly presented such application\n    . . . which contained such false statement . . . that is,\n    in an Immigration and Naturalization Service Form\n    I-589 (Application for Asylum or For Withholding\n    of Removal), the defendant made the following false\n    statements . . . .\n\nThe false statements alleged in the superceding indictment\nincluded Jawara’s response of “Sierra Leone” to questions\nregarding his nationality and birthplace.\n\n  The marriage fraud conspiracy charge read, in pertinent\npart:\n\n    At an exact time unknown, but beginning within the\n    past five years and continuing until on or around\n    November 13, 2004 . . . MOHAMED JAWARA,\n\f11358              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n    aka: HAJI JAWARA, and others . . . did knowingly\n    and willfully conspire . . . to enter into, and to aid\n    and abet others to enter into, a marriage for the pur-\n    pose of evading any provision of the immigration\n    law . . . .\n\nThe superceding indictment alleged that Jawara committed\nthe following overt acts in furtherance of the marriage fraud\nconspiracy:\n\n    a.   On or about June 24, 2004, . . . JAWARA did\n         facilitate a meeting between a cooperating wit-\n         ness, identified as P.C., an alien, and a female\n         United States citizen, in which the conspirators\n         discussed having the United States citizen marry\n         the alien in order to evade the immigration laws\n         of the United States.\n\n    b.   On or about November 13, 2004, . . .\n         JAWARA[ ] did meet with and solicit a cooper-\n         ating witness, identified as P.C., to procure a\n         United States citizen who would agree to marry\n         JAWARA in order to evade the immigration\n         laws of the United States.\n\n  Prior to trial, Jawara moved to sever the two counts, assert-\ning misjoinder under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a)\nand prejudicial joinder under Federal Rule of Criminal Proce-\ndure 14. Jawara also moved to suppress the documentary evi-\ndence seized during the search of his residence. After a\nhearing, the district court denied both motions.\n\n   Jawara also moved in limine to exclude the proposed expert\ntestimony of Carolyn Bayer-Broring, a forensic document\nexaminer employed by the Department of Homeland Security,\nregarding the authenticity of Jawara’s documents from Sierra\nLeone. Jawara requested a separate hearing to assess the reli-\nability of Bayer-Broring’s expert testimony. After an in limine\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11359\nhearing, the district court denied the motion to exclude the\nexpert testimony and determined that a separate Daubert hear-\ning was unnecessary. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharma-\nceuticals, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). The district court also\ndenied Jawara’s motions in limine to exclude certain aspects\nof Agent Smalley’s testimony and school examination records\nfrom The Gambia listing Mohamed Jawara as a local student.\n\n   At trial, Agent Smalley testified about his role in the inves-\ntigation, the asylum process in general, and the importance of\ncountry conditions in asylum determinations. Over defense\ncounsel’s objections, Agent Smalley testified that: (1) based\non his review of State Department country reports, country\nconditions in Sierra Leone were comparatively worse than in\nThe Gambia; (2) a substantially larger percentage of asylum\napplications were received from natives of Sierra Leone than\nThe Gambia; and (3) based on his review of various computer\nindices, including a site called “ethnolog.com,” the Maraka\ntribe (to which Jawara had claimed membership in his asylum\napplication) was not located in Sierra Leone but in The Gam-\nbia. Citing expertise in the area of forensic document exami-\nnation, Bayer-Broring also testified that the Sierra Leone\nidentity card and death certificate recovered from Jawara’s\napartment were counterfeit.\n\n   The government’s case included the testimony of two coop-\nerating witnesses: Essa Jobarteh and Peter Coleman. Jobarteh\ntestified that he was Jawara’s high school classmate at St.\nAugustine’s Secondary School in The Gambia from 1995 to\n1998 and that he knew Jawara by the names “Haji” and “Mo-\nhamed.” Jobarteh became reacquainted with Jawara in 2004\nat a party in the Seattle area. Jobarteh testified that when he\nsought Jawara’s advice about securing asylum in the United\nStates, Jawara advised him to get married instead because\n“it’s quicker to get your papers” and to marry an older woman\nbecause they were “kind of more desperate.” Over defense\ncounsel’s objection, the court admitted two examination\nrecords issued by the West African Examinations Counsel,\n\f11360                UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nlisting Mohamed Jawara as a student at St. Augustine’s in The\nGambia.\n\n  Coleman testified that Jawara represented himself as a\nGambian whose parents were still alive, that he knew Jawara\nby the names “Haji” and “Mohamed,” and that he and Jawara\nhad spoken generally about how “you can use someone else’s\ndocuments from another country” for immigration purposes.\nColeman recounted his discussions with Jawara about finding\na wife, first for Ibrahim, and then later, for Jawara himself.\nThe recorded meetings were played for the jury. During the\nNovember 2004 meeting, Jawara was recorded as saying that\nhe needed a wife for himself because he was “going through\nsome stuff with the INS . . . about [his] papers” and that he\nwanted to “finish [his] stuff and get [his] citizenship.”\n\n   The defense’s case consisted of Jawara’s testimony. Jawara\ntestified that his real name was Haji, he was born in Sierra\nLeone, and “Mohamed Jawara” was the name of his Gambian\ncousin, whose passport he borrowed to enter the United\nStates. He admitted using Mohamed Jawara’s passport and\nname to obtain various identity cards in the United States, but\nafter a few months, he sent the passport back to The Gambia.\nWith respect to the document fraud charge, Jawara acknowl-\nedged several falsehoods in his asylum application, including\nthe nature of his parents’ death. He maintained that he was\nunaware of the falsehoods at the time the application was filed\nbecause he was misled by Mohamed Ali,1 who prepared the\napplication. Jawara testified that aside from providing Ali\nwith copies of his Sierra Leonean identity card and death cer-\ntificate, he had no role in preparing the application and read\nno part of it before signing. Jawara denied attending high\n  1\n   The real name of this individual was apparently “Souleymane\nCamara.” The superceding indictment also charged Camara and two other\ndefendants with multiple counts of immigration fraud; the government\nagreed to sever Jawara’s trial from the proceedings of the other named\ndefendants.\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                 11361\nschool with Jobarteh in The Gambia or advising him to marry\na citizen. Jawara maintained that the fraudulent marriage idea\noriginated with Coleman and that Coleman initiated all dis-\ncussions and meetings on the subject.\n\n   The jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts. The dis-\ntrict court sentenced Jawara to ten months confinement, fol-\nlowed by two years of supervised release.\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\nI.   JOINDER AND SEVERANCE\n\n  Jawara argues the two counts were improperly joined under\nRule 8(a). Alternatively, he argues that even if the initial join-\nder was proper, the district court should have severed the\ncounts under Rule 14 because the joinder was prejudicial.\n\n   [1] Rule 8(a) provides for joinder of offenses against a sin-\ngle defendant in the indictment if one of three conditions is\nsatisfied. The offenses charged must be: (1) “of the same or\nsimilar character;” (2) “based on the same act or transaction;”\nor (3) “connected with or constitut[ing] parts of a common\nscheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Misjoinder of charges\nunder Rule 8(a) is a question of law reviewed de novo. United\nStates v.

R.\nCrim. P. 14(a). Thus, “[e]ven if joinder is permissible under\nRule 8, a party who feels prejudiced by joinder may move to\nsever pursuant to [Rule] 14.” United States v.

Though on occasion,\nour decisions have noted matters outside of the indictment,2\nthe established rule in this circuit is that a valid basis for join-\nder should be discernible from the face of the indictment,3 and\nwe remain faithful to that principle here.4\n   2\n     For example, in VonWillie, we recited the “indictment-only” standard\nand explained that joinder was proper because the “indictment charges\n[defendant] in count 1 with possessing the same three weapons that he is\ncharged in count 2 with using in relation to a drug trafficking crime”;\nhowever, we went on to note that “[t]estimonial and physical evidence . . .\nis also common to both counts.” 59 F.3d at 929.

Although this rationale makes\nsense in theory, commentators have questioned this justification in prac-\ntice: “Given the evident reluctance of . . . courts to grant separate trials\nunder Rule 14, a broad interpretation of Rule 8 means broad joinder,\nwhether or not this is just or fair.” 1A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, FEDERAL\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 143 (3d ed. 1999); see also Note, Harmless\nError and Misjoinder Under the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure: A\nNarrowing Division of Opinion, 6 HOFSTRA L.

It is for this reason that the courts’\ninterpretation of rule 8 and what they first determine to be the bounds of\nproper joinder are of central importance. A broad interpretation of rule 8\nmeans broad joinder.”).\n\f11364               UNITED STATES v.

Stated another way, we ask whether\n“[c]ommission of one of the offenses [ ]either depended upon\n[ ]or necessarily led to the commission of the other; proof of\nthe one act [ ]either constituted [ ]or depended upon proof of\nthe other.” United States v.

The document fraud count describes acts—\nknowingly making false statements on an asylum application\n— that were completed as of December 23, 2000. The mar-\nriage fraud conspiracy count describes very different acts—\nthe two meetings between Jawara and a “cooperating witness,\nidentified as P.C.”—that occurred several years later, on June\n24, 2004 and November 13, 2004. The document fraud charge\nmakes no reference to the “cooperating witness” that is cen-\ntral to the marriage fraud charge, and the marriage fraud\ncharge makes no reference to the asylum application that is\ncentral to the document fraud charge. Aside from the subject\nmatter of immigration, the superceding indictment does not\noffer a discernable link between the two offenses or suggest\nany overlapping evidence. No plan or common scheme links\nthe charges nor can any commonality be inferred from the\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11365\nindictment. See Terry, 911 F.2d at 276 (“No effort is made in\nthe indictment even to suggest that the offenses are . . . parts\nof a common scheme.”).\n\n   This case stands in marked contrast to situations where we\nhave determined that a “common scheme or plan” exists; such\ncases typically involve a concrete connection between the\noffenses that goes beyond mere thematic similarity.

For example,\nthe false statements were not made to bolster or help conceal\nthe marriage fraud conspiracy, nor can it be said that the mar-\nriage fraud conspiracy flowed from the document fraud crime.\nAlthough a close temporal relationship is not, in and of itself,\na sufficient condition for joinder, see Cardwell, 433 F.3d at\n386, we consider it significant in this case that the alleged acts\nunderlying the two offenses had no temporal connection and\nwere separated by several years. “Whatever connection exists\nhere, it is entirely too speculative to justify joinder” on the\nbasis of a common scheme or plan. Halper, 590 F.2d at 429.\n\n      2.   “Same or Similar Character”\n\n   The more difficult question is the government’s alternate\nbasis for joinder— that the offenses are of a “similar charac-\nter” because they relate to immigration fraud. The “same or\nsimilar character” prong of Rule 8(a) is the most amorphous\nand controversial of the three grounds for joinder.6 Numerous\ncourts and commentators have questioned the logic and fair-\nness of such a rule. See e.g., Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 627 (“It is\nobvious why Congress provided for joinder of counts that\ngrow out of related transactions . . . ; the reasons for allowing\njoinder of offenses having ‘the same or similar character’ is\nless clear.”); Halper, 590 F.2d at 430 (“When all that can be\nsaid of two separate offenses is that they are of the ‘same or\nsimilar character,’ the customary justifications for joinder\n(efficiency and economy) largely disappear. . . . At the same\ntime, the risk to the defendant in such circumstances is con-\nsiderable.”); Note, Joint and Single Trials under Rule 8 and\n  6\n    The “same and similar” language, like all of Rule 8(a),“was intended\nby the Advisory Committee to be substantially a restatement of the law\napplied prior to adoption of the rules.” 1A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT,\nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 141 (3d ed. 1999); see also Randazzo,\n80 F.3d at 627, n.1. (“The ‘same or similar’ language was drawn from ear-\nlier law without explanation.”).\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11367\n14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 74 YALE L.\nJ. 553, 560 (1965) (recommending “abolition of joinder of\nsimilar offenses under Rule 8” given its “lack of utility” and\nrisk of prejudice to the defendant); 1A CHARLES ALAN\nWRIGHT, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 143 (3d ed.\n1999) (“Joinder on this ground poses obvious dangers of prej-\nudice to the defendant. . . . [I]t may fairly be asked whether\njoinder of this kind should ever be allowed. If the offenses\narise out of separate and unrelated transactions, there is likely\nto be little saving in time and money in having a single\ntrial.”).\n\n   [5] Mindful of these significant concerns, we turn to the\nmore immediate question: does the fact that the two offenses\nrelate to immigration fraud make them of a “similar charac-\nter” for joinder purposes? We have upheld initial joinder on\nthe basis of “similar character” in a handful of decisions. See,\ne.g., United States v.

This case underscores the importance of provid-\ning more clarity and texture for assessing the propriety of\njoinder on the basis of “same or similar character,” and we\nendeavor here to fill in some of the blanks.\n\n   Our analysis in Terry provides a useful jumping-off point,\nalthough there, the analysis of the “common scheme” and\n“similar character” prongs of Rule 8(a) is intertwined, making\nit difficult to discern the dividing line between the two. In\nrejecting the “similar character” of drug and firearm offenses\nin Terry, we considered a variety of factors, such as the differ-\nent dates and locations of the acts underlying the two counts.\nTerry, 911 F.2d at 276 (“Count I and II describe an event\noccurring on June 9, 1988 in San Joaquin County. Count III\ndescribes an event occurring on June 22, 1988 in another city\nand county. The drug crimes referred to in Counts I and II are\nwholly different from the possession of a firearm charge in\nCount III.”). We also considered the fact that the evidence\nnecessary to prove one offense was different from, and did\nnot overlap with, evidence necessary to prove the other\noffense. Id. Thus, we undertook a fairly broad inquiry based\non factors that were readily apparent on the face of the indict-\nment or could be reasonably inferred from the allegations in\nthe indictment.\n\n   Looking to our sister circuits for guidance in the assess-\nment of “same or similar character,” the First and Seventh\nCircuits have addressed this issue at some length. Although\nboth circuits focus the Rule 8(a) inquiry on allegations in the\nindictment, see United States v. Coleman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668270\"><a href=\"/opinion/668270/united-states-v-phillip-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134\n(7th Cir. 1994); United States v.

JAWARA                       11369\n   The Seventh Circuit has adopted a “literal” or “categorical”\napproach that pays almost exclusive attention to likeness of\n“class” or “category” of the offenses, Coleman, 22 F.3d at\n133-34, while the First Circuit utilizes what could be charac-\nterized as a broader, more holistic approach that looks to a\nvariety of factors, including temporal proximity and potential\nfor evidentiary overlap. Cf. United States v. Edgar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196711\"><a href=\"/opinion/196711/united-states-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503 (1st Cir. 1996).7\n\n   In Coleman, a case involving the joinder of four separate\nweapons possession charges that occurred on different dates,\nthe Seventh Circuit moved away from a “balancing of time\nand evidence factors” embodied in previous cases, in favor of\na “more literal reading of the Rule.” 22 F.3d at 134. The court\nwrote that the “same or similar character” language in Rule\n8(a) was a “rather clear directive to compare the offenses\ncharged for categorical, not evidentiary, similarities.” Id. at\n133. Acknowledging the “scant” evidentiary overlap and tem-\nporal proximity between the joined offenses, id. at 132, the\nSeventh Circuit in Coleman nevertheless upheld joinder:\n“[s]imply put, if offenses are of like class, although not con-\nnected temporally or evidentially, the requisites of proper\njoinder should be satisfied so far as Rule 8(a) is concerned.”\nId. at 133.\n  7\n    Some other circuits are less easily categorized. For example, Coleman\ncites a Fifth Circuit case, United States v. Holloway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627365\"><a href=\"/opinion/627365/united-states-v-steve-wayne-holloway-and-edwin-l-hines/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir.\n1993), as applying a similar “categorical” approach. Coleman, 22 F.3d at\n133-34. However, temporal proximity was a factor in the Fifth Circuit’s\nanalysis in Holloway. 1 F.3d at 310-11. In United States v. Werner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377904\"><a href=\"/opinion/377904/united-states-v-louis-werner/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1980), the Second Circuit seemed to lean toward a literal\ninterpretation of “similar character”: “Rule 8(a) is not limited to crimes of\nthe ‘same’ character but also covers those of ‘similar’ character, which\nmeans ‘(n) early corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat\nalike; having a general likeness.’ ” Id. at 926 (quoting WEBSTER’S NEW\nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (2d ed.)). Yet, reading Werner in conjunction\nwith Halper, the Second Circuit’s “same or similar” inquiry considers the\nextent of evidentiary overlap. See Halper, 590 F.2d at 431.\n\f11370               UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   In adopting this “categorical” framework, the Seventh Cir-\ncuit explained that such an approach is “most consistent with\nthe respective roles of Rule 8 and Rule 14.” Id. at 134.\nNamely, the initial joinder decision, based solely on the\nindictment, offers little “real insight into the actual mutual rel-\nevance of the individual offenses and their surrounding cir-\ncumstances, which only crystallizes with the presentation of\nevidence at trial.” Id. The Seventh Circuit concluded that the\n“natural product” of this limitation is “[a]n uncomplicated\ninquiry and review of initial joinder,” while an “examination\nof the nature of the evidence and ties between the acts under-\nlying the offenses” is best left to Rule 14 severance decisions\n—with the extra caution that district courts should be “espe-\ncially watchful for possible . . . sources of prejudice” in cases\nof “same or similar character” joinder. Id.\n\n   We recognize that the initial joinder inquiry under Rule 8,\nwhich is confined to allegations in the indictment, offers a\nmore limited opportunity for detailed analysis than its more\n“flexible” Rule 14 counterpart. Id.; see also Terry, 911 F.2d\nat 277 (explaining that a Rule 14 motion to sever, unlike a\nRule 8 motion, “must be renewed at the close of evidence or\nit is waived,” so that the district court can “assess whether a\njoinder is prejudicial at a time when the evidence is fully\ndeveloped . . .”) (internal quotations and citation omitted). We\nare nonetheless uncomfortable with a Rule 8 “same or similar\ncharacter” inquiry that wholly ignores factors relevant to the\nquestion of similarity, such as temporal proximity, physical\nlocation, modes of operation, identity of the victims, likeli-\nhood of evidentiary overlap, and the like, to the extent that\nthey can be gleaned from the indictment. The Seventh Cir-\ncuit’s “categorical” approach, aside from instructing district\ncourts to eyeball the indictment for offenses of a “like class”\nand encouraging vigilant scrutiny in the Rule 14 context,\noffers little guidance in close cases. Depending on the level\nof abstraction (e.g., offenses involving dishonesty, offenses\ninvolving an intent to defraud), offenses of a “like class”\nmight encompass a host of otherwise unrelated offenses, mak-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11371\ning an “uncomplicated” similar character inquiry tantamount\nto no meaningful inquiry. And any “extra layer” of protection\nprovided by Rule 14 “does not relieve the trial court [or a\nreviewing court] of its responsibility to ensure that joinder is\nproper in the first instance.” Buchanan, 930 F. Supp. at 662\nn.14. Although the “like class” standard provides a useful\nbenchmark, in our view it is too limiting and does not com-\nport with our more expansive inquiry in Terry.\n\n   Our analysis in Terry more closely corresponds to the First\nCircuit’s comprehensive review and its “consider[ation] [of]\nsuch factors as ‘whether the charges are laid under the same\nstatute, whether they involve similar victims, locations, or\nmodes or operation, and the time frame in which the charged\nconduct occurred.’ ” Edgar, 82 F.3d at 503 (quoting United\nStates v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 973 (1st Cir. 1995)) (holding\nthat workers’ compensation and insurance fraud counts were\n“sufficiently similar” because they involved the same modus\noperandi, the timing overlapped, and the evidence would also\noverlap). This framework also considers the “extent of com-\nmon evidence,” particularly, “the important evidence.” Ran-\ndazzo, 80 F.3d at 628 (“Congress did not provide for joinder\nfor unrelated transactions . . . merely because some evidence\nmight be common to all of the counts.”).\n\n   [6] We consider it appropriate to consider factors such as\nthe elements of the statutory offenses, the temporal proximity\nof the acts, the likelihood and extent of evidentiary overlap,\nthe physical location of the acts, the modus operandi of the\ncrimes, and the identity of the victims in assessing whether an\nindictment meets the “same or similar character” prong of\nRule 8(a). The weight given to a particular factor will depend\non the specific context of the case and the allegations in the\nindictment. But the bottom line is that the similar character of\nthe joined offenses should be ascertainable—either readily\napparent or reasonably inferred—from the face of the indict-\nment. Courts should not have to engage in inferential gymnas-\ntics or resort to implausible levels of abstraction to divine\n\f11372                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nsimilarity. Thus, where the government seeks joinder of\ncounts on the basis of “same or similar character,” it crafts a\nbarebones indictment at its own risk.\n\n   [7] Applying this inquiry to the indictment here, it is appar-\nent that the two counts are not of the “same or similar charac-\nter.” The indictment alleges two different statutory violations\nrequiring proof of different elements.8 The underlying acts\nalleged in the indictment are separated by three-and-a-half\nyears, a temporal distance that is not bridged by the “exact\ntime unknown” language appearing at the start of the mar-\nriage fraud charge. The lack of any temporal connection is all\nthe more significant because the counts do not stem from\ncommon events. As for potential evidentiary overlap, Peter\nColeman, the cooperating witness whose centrality to the\nmarriage fraud charge is obvious from the indictment, is nota-\nbly absent from the document fraud charge; nor is any other\nevidentiary link ascertainable from the indictment. The indict-\nment evinces no similar mode of operation with respect to the\ntwo crimes—lying about being from Sierra Leone on an asy-\nlum application is vastly different from facilitating or procur-\n  8\n  18 U.S.C. § 1546, “Fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other docu-\nments,” provides, in relevant part:\n      Whoever knowingly makes under oath, or as permitted under\n      penalty of perjury . . . knowingly subscribes as true, any false\n      statement with respect to a material fact in any application, affi-\n      davit, or other document required by the immigration laws or reg-\n      ulations prescribed thereunder, or knowingly presents any such\n      application, affidavit, or other document which contains any such\n      false statement or which fails to contain any reasonable basis in\n      law or fact—\n      Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned . . .\n      8 U.S.C. § 1325, “Improper entry by alien,” provides, in relevant\n      part:\n      Any individual who knowingly enters into a marriage for the pur-\n      pose of evading any provision of the immigration laws shall be\n      imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or fined not more than\n      $250,000, or both.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11373\ning meetings with prospective marriage candidates. The\ncounts do not involve related geographic locations or related\nvictims of the fraud. Ultimately, the only similarity discern-\nible from the indictment is that both counts involve immigra-\ntion. Such a “vague thematic connection” cannot, in and of\nitself, justify joinder. Buchanan, 930 F. Supp. at 662.\n\n   If subject matter similarity alone were sufficient, wholly\nunrelated charges for threatening an immigration officer upon\ninitial entry to the United States and participating in an alien\nsmuggling operation several years later could be deemed to be\nof the “same or similar character.” Or, in the drug context,\nconsider the example of a pharmacist who sells, over the\ncounter, unlawful amounts of products containing pseu-\ndoephedrine and then, some years later, buys cocaine from a\ngovernment informant. Both crimes involve drugs and a drug-\ngist, but surely such a general thematic commonality does not\nmake the offenses of the “same or similar character.” To\nextend the rule so broadly would lead to absurd results and\nrender the “same or similar” test without meaningful limits.\n\n   [8] Even under the Seventh Circuit’s “like class” test, we\ndo not view these two immigration violations as being of “like\nclass.” The immigration document fraud charge is, in essence,\na perjury claim related to Jawara’s national origin. The other\ncharge stems from an arrangement to facilitate sham mar-\nriages. The proof is in the framing. We interpret “similar” to\nmean something beyond facial similarity of subject matter.\nLooking at the allegations in the indictment, including any\nreasonable inferences of the connections and similarities that\nmay be drawn about these two counts, we hold that the counts\ndo not qualify as “same or similar” under Rule 8.\n\n    3.   Actual Prejudice\n\n  [9] According to the Supreme Court, our inquiry does not\nend here. “A violation of Rule 8 ‘requires reversal only if the\nmisjoinder results in actual prejudice because it had a substan-\n\f11374                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\ntial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s\nverdict.’ ” Terry, 911 F.2d at 277 (quoting United States v.\nLane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449 (1986)). This standard, though “ex-\nacting,” Rousseau, 257 F.3d at 932, is less exacting than Rule\n14’s “manifest prejudice” standard. See United States v.\nLewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468195\"><a href=\"/opinion/468195/united-states-v-gregory-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1321 (9th Cir. 1986) (Under Rule 14,\n“[t]he defendant has the burden of proving that the joint trial\nwas manifestly prejudicial,” such that “defendant’s right to a\nfair trial was abridged.”). In any case, we will not presume\nthat “prejudice results whenever [Rule 8’s] requirements have\nnot been satisfied.” Lane, 474 U.S. at 449.\n\n   In Lane, the Supreme Court considered a variety of factors\nin resolving that misjoinder under Rule 8 did not have a “sub-\nstantial and injurious” effect on the jury’s verdict, including\nthe “overwhelming evidence of guilt shown,” the provision of\na “proper limiting instruction . . . admonish[ing] the jury to\nconsider each count and defendant separately,” and the likeli-\nhood that evidence admitted on the misjoined count would\nhave been admissible in a separate trial as evidence of intent\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).9 Id. at 450. The Court\nalso refused to “necessarily assume that the jury misunder-\nstood or disobeyed” the district court’s limiting instruction,\nand noted that the evidence as to one count “was distinct and\neasily segregated from evidence” relating to the other counts.\nId. at 450 n. 13.\n\n  [10] After carefully reviewing the trial record as a whole,\nwe are comfortable in our analysis that misjoinder did not\n  9\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides:\n      Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\n      prove the character of a person in order to show action in confor-\n      mity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other pur-\n      poses, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n      plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, pro-\n      vided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a crim-\n      inal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial . . . .\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA               11375\nhave a “substantial and injurious” effect on the verdict. A\nnumber of factors support this conclusion. We begin with the\nfact that the district court instructed the jury to treat the\ncharges separately: “A separate crime is charged against the\ndefendant in each count. You must decide each count sepa-\nrately. Your verdict as to one count should not control your\nverdict on any other count.” That “the district court specifi-\ncally instructed the jury that it was obliged to consider the\ncounts separately . . . . militates against a finding of preju-\ndice.” Rousseau, 257 F.3d at 932; see also Fiorillo, 186 F.3d\nat 1145 (explaining that even if misjoinder occurred, the\ncourt’s jury instruction “to deliberate on the elements of each\ncharge separately . . . . militates against a finding of preju-\ndice”).\n\n   [11] In addition, the evidence of guilt was overwhelming as\nto both counts. See Lane, 474 U.S. at 450 (“In the face of\noverwhelming evidence of guilt shown here, we are satisfied\nthat the [misjoinder] was harmless.”). The recorded meetings\nand Coleman’s testimony conclusively demonstrated Jawara’s\nparticipation in the marriage fraud conspiracy. Jawara’s credi-\nbility was not a central issue as he was hard pressed to dis-\navow the recorded admissions. As for the document fraud\ncharge, Jawara admitted numerous falsehoods in his applica-\ntion and acknowledged providing the two Sierra Leonean\nidentity documents to Ali, which Bayer-Broring testified were\ncounterfeit. To the extent that Jawara’s credibility was an\nimportant factor in the document fraud conviction, his own\ntestimony consisted of numerous credibility-eroding admis-\nsions, including his repeated use of his Gambian cousin’s\nname and passport to secure various identity documents in the\nUnited States.\n\n   Given the strength of the individual cases, we do not con-\nfront a situation where prejudice might stem from a disparity\nof evidence—i.e., a weak case joined with a strong case. See,\ne.g., Bean v. Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760224\"><a href=\"/opinion/760224/98-cal-daily-op-serv-9096-98-daily-journal-dar-12770-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1085 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(explaining that “prejudice resulted from the disparity\n\f11376               UNITED STATES v.

The issues in this four-day trial were relatively simple,\nand the evidence central to the document fraud count—the\nasylum application, the Sierra Leonean identity documents\nand Bayer-Broring’s testimony—was distinct and easily seg-\nregated from evidence central to the marriage fraud count—\nthe recordings and Coleman’s testimony. See, e.g., Lane, 474\nU.S. at 450, n. 13 (noting that misjoinder error was harmless,\nin part, because “the evidence as to [the counts] was distinct\nand easily segregated”).\n\n   In claiming prejudice as a result of the joinder, Jawara\noffers the general assertion that “evidence of alleged material\nmisstatements in an asylum application would not have been\nadmissible against [him] in a separate trial on the charge of\nconspiracy to commit marriage fraud, and vice versa.” We\nhave observed that one of the ways that joinder of offenses\nmay prejudice a defendant is that “the jury may use the evi-\ndence of one of the crimes charged to infer a criminal disposi-\ntion on the part of the defendant from which is found his guilt\n\f                       UNITED STATES v.

Jawara does not point to any specific “inadmissi-\nble” evidence in support of this assertion. Even if some of the\nevidence would not have been cross-admissible in separate\ntrials, it is likely that the jury was able to “compartmentalize\nthe evidence” in light of the other factors we have described.\nThus, in this case, evidence related to one crime did not likely\n“taint the jury’s consideration” of the other crime. Johnson,\n820 F.2d at 1071; see also Bean, 163 F.3d at 1085\n(“[P]rejudice generally does not arise from joinder when the\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct, even in the\nabsence of cross-admissibility [of the evidence].”); Drew, 331\nF.2d at 91 (“The federal courts, including our own, have,\nhowever, found no prejudicial effect from joinder when the\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct, even though\nsuch evidence might not have been admissible in separate tri-\nals . . . .”).\n\n   [13] In the absence of prejudice, reversal is not required.\nSince Jawara has not established that he was prejudiced by the\nviolation of Rule 8, he cannot satisfy the burden of demon-\nstrating “manifest prejudice” under Rule 14.\n\nII.

To allow a magistrate to be misled in such a\nmanner could denude the probable cause requirement of all\nreal meaning.”). In addition, the defendant must show that the\n“affidavit, once corrected and supplemented,” would not\n“provide . . . a substantial basis for concluding that probable\ncause existed” to search defendant’s residence. Id. at 782.\nJawara fails, in several respects, to make this showing.\n\n  Jawara fails to show how the alleged omission was\n“material”—i.e., how it caused technically true statements in\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11379\nthe affidavit to be misleading. The first sentence of the dis-\nputed paragraph—“I began working on this case after deter-\nmining that an individual calling himself Haji JAWARA may\nalso be known as Mohamed JAWARA”—indicates that\nAgent Smalley is the source of the information in this para-\ngraph. Although the second sentence—“It was believed that\nhe was using a false identity . . .” —does not indicate a spe-\ncific source, it is unclear how this omission is material when\nread in the context of the first sentence and the dozen para-\ngraphs following it, which describe in excruciating detail how\nAgent Smalley discovered that “Mohamed” and “Haji” were\nthe same person based on his comparison of photographs,\ndriver licenses, and other documents, and his discovery of\ncontradictory immigration documents submitted under both\nnames.\n\n   [14] Jawara also fails to make any showing, let alone “a\nsubstantial showing” that this omission of source was “delib-\nerate or reckless.” Id. at 781. In his briefs, Jawara offers only\nthe observation that “[o]ne cannot determine whether that\nomission was deliberate or reckless.” Nor does Jawara dem-\nonstrate that the affidavit, when supplemented with the omit-\nted information, would be insufficient to support a probable\ncause finding. Id. at 782. Thus, the district court did not err\nin denying Jawara’s suppression motion.\n\n  B.   DAUBERT HEARING\n\n   The district court denied Jawara’s request for a pre-trial\nDaubert hearing to determine the reliability of Bayer-\nBroring’s expert testimony. District courts have a general\n“gatekeeping” duty to ensure that proffered expert testimony\n“both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task\nat hand.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597. This obligation does not,\nhowever, require the court to hold a separate Daubert hearing.\nUnited States v. Alatorre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769931\"><a href=\"/opinion/769931/united-states-v-jorge-alberto-alatorre/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(“Nowhere . . . does the Supreme Court mandate the form that\nthe inquiry into reliability and relevance must take . . . .”).\n\f11380               UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   [15] The district court admitted Bayer-Broring’s testimony\nafter reviewing briefs and other materials relating to the in\nlimine motion and hearing lengthy oral argument from both\ncounsel. Bayer-Broring’s qualifications included a master’s\ndegree in Forensic Science, a certification in forensic docu-\nment examination, and experience in over 700 document\nexaminations, including 50-60 examinations of documents\nallegedly from Sierra Leone. The district court stated only:\n“The testimony will be allowed, and the Court finds that a\nDaubert hearing is unnecessary.” Although the district court’s\nruling suggests an implicit finding of reliability, the failure to\nmake an explicit reliability finding was error.

OTHER EVIDENTIARY CHALLENGES\n\n    1.    Agent Smalley’s Testimony\n\n   Agent Smalley testified about the comparative country con-\nditions in Sierra Leone and The Gambia and the location of\nthe Maraka tribe in The Gambia, testimony Jawara challenges\nas inadmissible hearsay and a violation of his Sixth Amend-\nment right to confrontation. In addition, Jawara challenges the\nrelevance of Agent Smalley’s testimony regarding the relative\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11381\nnumber of asylum applications from natives of Sierra Leone\nand The Gambia. We review the evidentiary claims for abuse\nof discretion, Rahm, 993 F.2d at 1410, and the constitutional\nclaim for plain error because Jawara failed to object on Con-\nfrontation Clause grounds. See United States v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792170\"><a href=\"/opinion/792170/united-states-v-koran-mckinley-allen-aka-sinbad/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1235 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n   In his briefs, Jawara appears to concede that Agent Smalley\nwas a qualified expert witness on immigration and asylum\nmatters. Agent Smalley’s testimony regarding comparative\ncountry conditions, founded on State Department country\nreports, was properly admitted because these reports are “of\na type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field\nin forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,” Fed. R.\nEvid. 703, and the probative value of the underlying data out-\nweighed any prejudicial effect it might have had on the jury.\nSee Turner v. Burlington N. Santa Fe R.R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783028\"><a href=\"/opinion/783028/howard-turner-mary-turner-bill-oskowski-marisa-oskowski-v-burlington/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1061 (9th Cir. 2003). That defense counsel had “ample\nopportunity to cross-examine [Agent Smalley] about his\nexpert opinion, and the sources of information upon which\nthat opinion was based . . . is a sufficient basis upon which\nto reject [Jawara’s] confrontation clause argument.” United\nStates v. Beltran-Rios, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525666\"><a href=\"/opinion/525666/united-states-v-luis-beltran-rios/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1213 (9th Cir. 1989).\n\n   Although the record does not reveal whether the computer\nindices Agent Smalley relied upon in testifying about the\nlocation of the Maraka tribe were “of a type reasonably relied\nupon by experts in the particular field,” Fed. R. Evid. 703, the\ndistrict court’s admission of this testimony was harmless. The\nonly effect of this testimony was to demonstrate that the asy-\nlum application contained inconsistencies and false state-\nments, a fact Jawara readily admitted in his own testimony.\nJawara’s only defense was that he never read the application.\nDuring cross examination, defense counsel effectively ques-\ntioned Agent Smalley about this testimony and elicited a\nresponse favorable to Jawara that a member of this tribe could\nrelocate to another area without losing his ethnic or tribal des-\nignation.\n\f11382                    UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\n   [16] Similarly, although we doubt the relevance of Agent\nSmalley’s testimony regarding the relative number of asylum\napplications filed by natives of Sierra Leone and The Gambia,\nthe admission of that testimony was harmless. “[I]t is more\nprobable than not that the error did not materially affect the\nverdict.” Rahm, 993 F.2d at 1415.\n\n        2.   Gambian School Examination Records\n\n   The district court admitted into evidence two Gambian\nschool examination records, Exhibits 16.2 and 16.3. The gov-\nernment contends that these documents were properly admit-\nted as foreign business records. See 18 U.S.C. § 3505. Jawara\nargues that § 3505 does not support the admission of these\ndocuments, and that they should have been excluded on hear-\nsay and authenticity grounds.\n\n   “Pursuant to § 3505, ‘[i]n a criminal proceeding . . . , a for-\neign record of regularly conducted activity, or a copy of such\nrecord, shall not be excluded as evidence by the hearsay rule\nif a foreign certification attests’ ” to the requirements set forth\nin § 3505(a)(1)(A)-(D).11 United States v.

JAWARA                11383\n(6th Cir. 1991)).

The document contains a stamp\nimprint from the “West African Examinations Council” and\nreads, in relevant part:\n\n    This is to certify that according to records in this\n    Office MUHAMMED JAWARA took The West\n    African Senior School Certificate Examination in\n    May/June 1998 at the St. Augustine’s Senior Sec-\n    ondary School as candidate No. 8010002152.\n\nThat statement, along with “details of [Jawara’s] [exam] per-\nformance” in several subjects, are incorporated into a letter\nfrom the Council dated “17th February 2005.” The letter, in\nturn, is attached to an attestation by Abraham Jouf, the head\nof the Test Development Department.\n\n   [17] Jawara argues that this attestation failed to meet the\nrequirements of § 3505(a)(1)(A)-(D). Although Jouf’s attesta-\ntion does not mirror the exact language of § 3505(a)(1), it sat-\nisfies the statutory requirements in substance—the\ncertification confirms the accuracy of the test records main-\ntained in the files of the examination agency. Because the dis-\nputed document contains sufficient indicia of reliability, the\ndistrict court was within its discretion to admit the document.\nWe also note that the information contained in this exhibit is,\n\f11384                 UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nin any case, duplicative of Exhibit 16.3, which falls squarely\nwithin the purview of § 3505.\n\n   Exhibit 16.3 lists “May/June 1998” examination results for\nstudents from “St. Augustine’s Senior Secondary School” in\nBanjul, The Gambia, including “Jawara Muhammed.” It con-\ntains the heading “The West African Examinations Council”\nand has a stamp imprint from the “Principal” of St. Augus-\ntine’s. This document is accompanied by a “Certificate of\nAuthenticity of Business Records,” signed on January 14,\n2005 by Charles Mendy, who attested on penalty of perjury\nthat he is the principal of St. Augustine’s. Mendy’s attestation\ncontains language exactly mirroring § 3505(a)(1)(A)-(D).\n\n   Notably, at the in limine hearing, Jawara’s attorney initially\nacknowledged that the exhibit satisfied the statutory require-\nments: “[E]xhibit 16.3 . . . this is one exhibit from St. Augus-\ntine’s which does seem to be covered by the certification. The\ncertification certainly tracks the language of the statute . . . .”\nJawara later claimed that § 3505 does not support the admis-\nsion of Exhibit 16.3 because the principal of St. Augustine’s\ncannot attest to an examination record prepared by the West\nAfrican Examinations Council. This argument is without\nmerit.\n\n   [18] Section 3505 provides for a “foreign certification” by\n“the custodian of a foreign record of regularly conducted\nactivity or another qualified person.” 18 U.S.C. § 3505(c)(2)\n(emphasis added). As the school’s principal, Mendy was a\nproper “custodian” of official examination records for stu-\ndents attending his school. See United States v.

I would hold\nthat erroneously joining the two counts — falsifying one’s\nown immigration documents, and conspiring over a substan-\ntial period of time to aid other persons to enter into fraudulent\nmarriages in violation of the immigration laws — had a “sub-\nstantial and injurious effect” upon the jury’s determination.\nUnited States v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449 (1986).\n\n   Although the majority characterizes the evidence of guilt\nunder both counts as “overwhelming,” Maj. at 11375, the evi-\ndence with respect to the falsification of the defendant’s own\nimmigration documents is clearly not. Jawara never denied\nthat there were material errors in his asylum application. To\nthe contrary, he acknowledged the errors in the application,\nbut testified that he was not aware of their existence because\nanother individual prepared the document for him. He also\ntestified that he was unaware of any problems regarding the\nsupporting documents and that he had received the identifica-\ntion card from a government office and his birth certificate\nfrom his brother in Sierra Leone. The crucial issue with\nrespect to the document fraud charge, thus, was Jawara’s\ncredibility. Although the government presented an expert wit-\nness whose testimony rendered some of Jawara’s testimony\n\f11386              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nimplausible, if the jury nevertheless believed his explanations\nit would have acquitted him on that charge.\n\n   In the vast majority of cases, and especially in cases in\nwhich a defendant’s credibility is the crucial issue, the most\nprejudicial evidence the prosecution can present — perhaps\naside from a confession — is testimony establishing that the\ndefendant has committed other serious crimes and is a bad\nperson generally. Evidence of other crimes is particularly\ndamning when the other crimes, as in this case, are of the\nsame general type (here, immigration offenses) as the offense\nwith which the defendant is charged. Here, it is plain not only\nthat Jawara’s credibility was undermined, but that his entire\ndefense to the document fraud charge was destroyed when the\nprosecution was allowed not only to inform, but to persuade,\nthe jury that following his own immigration violations Jawara\nengaged in a course of criminal conduct in violation of the\nimmigration laws — that he engaged in a continuous pattern\nof immigration fraud in aiding others to arrange fraudulent\nmarriages to circumvent the immigration statutes. Once the\njury reached its conclusion that Jawara had committed the\nserious criminal offense of conspiring over an extended\nperiod of time to aid others to fraudulently violate the immi-\ngration laws, so that they would become eligible to remain in\nthe United States, it was almost inevitable that it would\nbelieve that Jawara violated the immigration laws with respect\nto his own immigration papers so that he would be able to\nremain here. The case with respect to Jawara’s unlawful aid\nto others having been proven, it is unreasonable to expect that\nthe jury would consider the question of Jawara’s falsification\nof his own documents solely on the evidence relative to that\ncount. Persuading the jury of Jawara’s guilt on the more seri-\nous conspiracy charge eliminated any real possibility that it\nwould accept his contention that he was unaware of the mis-\nrepresentations in his own application and the errors in his\nother documents.\n\n  Prejudice can arise even more readily than in the average\ncase when there is misjoinder of a crime that would be partic-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. JAWARA                11387\nularly disturbing to the average juror. Conspiring to violate\nthe immigration laws by aiding a number of aliens to remain\nin the country unlawfully and obtain permanent resident status\nwould be highly offensive to many jurors these days. In\nUnited States v. Terry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546335\"><a href=\"/opinion/546335/united-states-v-edward-terry/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1990), a leading\ncase on misjoinder, we held that the district court erred under\nRule 8(a) in joining two drug-related charges with a count of\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm. We concluded that\nthe misjoinder prejudiced the defendant:\n\n    A juror would inevitably be more disturbed about the\n    idea of a “drug dealer” with a gun than a citizen who\n    previously had committed some unknown crime. It\n    is highly probable that this inculpatory characteriza-\n    tion of Terry as a drug dealer influenced the jury in\n    determining its verdict.\n\nId. at 277. Similarly, here, the jury likely was influenced, in\ndetermining whether Jawara was guilty of submitting his own\nfraudulent immigration document, by its conclusion that he\nhad in fact conspired to commit immigration fraud to aid oth-\ners over an extended period of time.\n\n   Furthermore, a “substantial disparity” in the strength of the\nevidence of two separate offenses which are joined can\n“taint[ ] the jury’s consideration” of the offense for which\nthere is weaker evidence. Bean v. Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760224\"><a href=\"/opinion/760224/98-cal-daily-op-serv-9096-98-daily-journal-dar-12770-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1085 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing Lucero v. Kerby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155821\"><a href=\"/opinion/155821/lucero-v-kerby/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1315 (10th Cir. 1998)). By hearing far stronger evidence on\nthe conspiracy charge than the document fraud charge, the\njury may have experienced “ ‘the human tendency to draw a\nconclusion which is impermissible in the law: because he did\nit before, he must have done it again.’ ” Id. (quoting United\nStates v. Bagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457913\"><a href=\"/opinion/457913/united-states-v-carlo-scott-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488 (9th Cir. 1985)).\n\n   Although the majority relies heavily on its technical argu-\nments that the district court’s error was mitigated by the\ninstruction that the jury consider the counts separately, Maj.\n\f11388              UNITED STATES v. JAWARA\nat 11374-75, and that the jury could compartmentalize the evi-\ndence as to each charge, these factors, while not irrelevant,\nare hardly sufficient to overcome the overwhelming actual\nprejudice created in this case by joinder with the conspiracy\ncharge.\n\n   For these reasons, I would find the improper joinder preju-\ndicial, at least with respect to the document fraud charge.\nAccordingly, I dissent from the majority’s holding that there\nwas no prejudice in this case.\n\f</pre>",
