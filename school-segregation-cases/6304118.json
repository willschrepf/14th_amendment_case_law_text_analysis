A racial desegregation order issued in 1971 still governs the\n\nJefferson County Board of Education in Alabama. But beginning in 2012, residents\n\nof the City of Gardendale, a predominantly white community in Jefferson County,\n\nsought to create a separate, municipal school system. Leaders of a grassroots\n\nmovement used social media to discuss the changing racial demographics of their\n\nschools as they campaigned for the creation of a city school board and new taxes to\n\nsupport the proposed school system. In 2015, the newly created Gardendale City\n\nBoard of Education moved the district court to permit it to operate a municipal\n\nschool system, but black schoolchildren opposed the motion. The district court\n\nfound that the Gardendale Board acted with a discriminatory purpose to exclude\n\nblack children from the proposed school system and, alternatively, that the\n\nsecession of the Gardendale Board would impede the efforts of the Jefferson\n\n*\n  Honorable Raymond C. Clevenger III, United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 3 of 61\n\n\nCounty Board to fulfill its desegregation obligations. Despite these findings, the\n\ndistrict court devised and permitted a partial secession that neither party requested.\n\nWe conclude that the district court committed no clear error in its findings of a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose and of impeding the desegregation of the Jefferson County\n\nschools, but that it abused its discretion when it sua sponte allowed a partial\n\nsecession. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions to deny\n\nthe motion to secede.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n      We divide our discussion of the background of this appeal in three parts.\n\nFirst, we discuss the early history of this litigation. Second, we discuss the\n\nevolution of the Gardendale secession movement. Third, we discuss the motion\n\nfiled by the Gardendale Board and the order entered by the district court.\n\n                        A. The Early History of this Litigation\n      In 1965, Linda Stout’s father sued the Jefferson County Board of Education\n\non behalf of her and a class of black schoolchildren for “operating a compulsory\n\nbiracial school system” eleven years after the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954), that “[s]eparate\n\neducational facilities are inherently unequal” and deprive black children “of the\n\nequal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.” The\n\ndistrict court ordered the Jefferson County Board of Education to devise a plan to\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f              Case: 17-12338        Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 4 of 61\n\n\nbegin desegregating its schools in the 1965–66 academic year. And the United\n\nStates intervened as a plaintiff.\n\n      Dilatory tactics and half-hearted efforts slowed the pace of desegregation.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Educ., 372 F.2d 836, 878 (5th Cir.\n\n1966) (Wisdom, J.) (explaining that school-board plans had “little prospect of . . .\n\never undoing past discrimination or of coming close to the goal of equal\n\neducational opportunities”), aff’d en banc, 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1967); see also,\n\ne.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 13 (1971)\n\n(discussing the “[d]eliberate resistance of some to the [Supreme] Court’s\n\nmandates”). By 1969, black children in Jefferson County had yet to realize the full\n\npromise of Brown I. Spurred by the mandate to “terminate dual school systems at\n\nonce,” Alexander v. Holmes Cty. Bd. of Educ., 396 U.S. 19, 20 (1969), our\n\npredecessor circuit consolidated this case with twelve other desegregation cases\n\nand directed the district courts to require the immediate merger of “faculties and\n\nstaff, transportation, services, athletics and other extracurricular activities” as well\n\nas the merger of “student bodies,” Singleton v. Jackson Mun. Separate Sch. Dist.,\n\n419 F.2d 1211, 1217 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc). In 1970, the district court entered a\n\ncomprehensive desegregation order.\n\n      After four predominantly white cities—Pleasant Grove, Vestavia Hills,\n\nHomewood, and Midfield—withdrew from the Jefferson County school system\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 5 of 61\n\n\nand formed municipal school districts, our predecessor circuit directed the district\n\ncourt to “require the school board forthwith to implement a student assignment\n\nplan” that “encompasses the entire Jefferson County School District as it stood at\n\nthe time of the original filing of this desegregation suit.” Stout v. Jefferson Cty. Bd.\n\nof Educ. (Stout I), 448 F.2d 403, 404 (5th Cir. 1971) (footnote omitted). It declared\n\nthat “where the formulation of splinter school districts, albeit validly created under\n\nstate law, have the effect of thwarting the implementation of a unitary school\n\nsystem, the district court may not . . . recognize their creation.” Id. (footnote and\n\ncitation omitted). And it directed the district court to “implement fully” its\n\ndesegregation order. Id.\n\n      In 1971, the district court issued the desegregation order that still governs\n\nthe operations of the Jefferson County school system. The 1971 order established\n\nschool attendance zones, including the Gardendale attendance zone, and\n\ncomprehensive policies for student assignments, school construction, and the\n\ntransfer of students between attendance zones. The order included a provision that\n\npermits some students to transfer from schools in which their race is in the\n\nmajority to schools in which their race is in the minority. And it provided that\n\nJefferson County must pay municipal school systems that educate students from\n\nunincorporated areas of the County the ad valorem school taxes collected from\n\nthose areas. The order also established several requirements for municipal systems\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 6 of 61\n\n\nto secede, including a requirement that a municipal system “make sufficient space\n\navailable for black students from the county system” so that black student\n\nenrollment in a municipal system equals at least one-third of the white student\n\nenrollment in the new system.\n\n      In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled in Wright v. Council of the City of\n\nEmporia that “a new school district may not be created where its effect would be to\n\nimpede the process of dismantling a dual system.” 407 U.S. 451, 470 (1972). The\n\nCourt explained that the inquiry into whether a splinter district should be permitted\n\nto secede depends on its effect, even if the splinter district has a benign motive:\n\n“The existence of a permissible purpose cannot sustain an action that has an\n\nimpermissible effect.” Id. at 462. And in Ross v. Houston Independent School\n\nDistrict (Ross II), our predecessor circuit made clear that “the proponents of the\n\nnew district must bear a heavy burden to show the lack of deleterious effects on\n\ndesegregation.” 583 F.2d 712, 714 (5th Cir. 1978). Only if they satisfy that “heavy\n\nburden” may a district court permit secession. Id.\n\n      When the Pleasant Grove Board of Education refused to comply with the\n\n1971 order and “accept its role” in the desegregation of the Jefferson County\n\nschool system, our predecessor circuit affirmed an order that the Jefferson County\n\nBoard “take up the operation of the Pleasant Grove district schools.” Stout v.\n\nJefferson Cty. Bd. of Educ. (Stout II), 466 F.2d 1213, 1214 (5th Cir. 1972). The\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f               Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 7 of 61\n\n\nFifth Circuit stressed that “[s]overeignty should be returned” to the Pleasant Grove\n\nBoard only after it “demonstrates to the district court’s satisfaction by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that it is able and intends to comply with the court’s orders\n\nconcerning its role in the desegregation of the Jefferson County School District.”\n\nId. at 1215. To this day, the Pleasant Grove Board has never satisfied that burden.\n\n       In 1976, our predecessor circuit acknowledged that Jefferson County had\n\nmade “great progress” toward desegregation, but the circuit court cautioned that\n\nfederal supervision was still required. Stout v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Educ. (Stout\n\nIII), 537 F.2d 800, 801 (5th Cir. 1976). The circuit court affirmed a refusal to\n\nrequire busing between two predominantly white and black school zones as\n\ndangerous and infeasible. Id. And it stated that “the former dual school system has\n\nbeen effectively dismantled and a unitary system substituted.” Id. at 802. Even so,\n\nit determined that the school system still “must continue under the scrutiny and\n\nsurveillance of the district court,” and it directed that the district court consider\n\n“broadening and making more attractive its existing majority-to-minority transfer\n\nprocedures and . . . strengthening the curriculum to magnet levels in [two]\n\nfacilities.” Id. at 803.\n\n       Predominantly white municipalities continued to secede and slowly, but\n\nsignificantly, change the demographic makeup of the Jefferson County schools.\n\nSince the dissolution of the Pleasant Grove school system, three other\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 8 of 61\n\n\npredominantly white municipalities—Hoover, Trussville, and Leeds—seceded\n\nfrom the Jefferson County school system. And some municipalities later annexed\n\npredominantly white communities in the County. In 2003, for example, the City of\n\nVestavia Hills annexed the Cahaba Heights community, the population of which\n\nwas about 95 percent white as of 2010. And the secession of Trussville and Leeds\n\nalone led to about a 3 percentage point decrease in the white population and a 3\n\npercentage point increase in the black population in the Jefferson County school\n\nsystem.\n\n      The cumulative impact of these municipal secessions and suburban growth\n\nhas been dramatic. In 2000, the student population in the Jefferson County school\n\nsystem was about 75 percent white and 23 percent black. But by 2015, the student\n\npopulation of the school system was approximately 43 percent white and 47\n\npercent black.\n\n             B. The Evolution of the Gardendale Secession Movement\n      The Gardendale secession movement started when the schools in that City\n\nwere becoming racially diverse while the population of the City remained\n\noverwhelmingly white. In 1996, the student population in Gardendale was 92\n\npercent white and 8 percent black. The current population of the City has a similar\n\ndemographic makeup. As of 2010, more than 88 percent of the population was\n\nwhite and less than 9 percent was black. But by 2010, only one of the four public\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 9 of 61\n\n\nschools in Gardendale, Snow Rogers Elementary School, came close to mirroring\n\nthe racial demographics of the City. In 2010, Snow Rogers Elementary was about\n\n94 percent white and 4 percent black. The other three schools in Gardendale—\n\nGardendale Elementary, Bragg Middle School, and Gardendale High School—\n\nwere less than 80 percent white and 20 or more percent black. Gardendale\n\nElementary was about 75 percent white and 20 percent black; Bragg Middle was\n\nabout 77 percent white and 21 percent black; and Gardendale High was about 75\n\npercent white and 23 percent black. And in later years, the schools continued to\n\nbecome more racially diverse in even starker contrast with the demographics of the\n\nCity. Snow Rogers Elementary had a student population that was about 85 percent\n\nwhite and 5 percent black during the 2015–16 academic year. Gardendale\n\nElementary was about 71 percent white and 24 percent black. Bragg Middle was\n\nabout 67 percent white and 29 percent black. And Gardendale High was about 71\n\npercent white and 27 percent black.\n\n      The racial diversity of the schools in Gardendale stems from the attendance\n\nof students who reside outside its municipal limits. Students from the\n\npredominantly black community of North Smithfield/Greenleaf Heights constitute\n\nnearly 30 percent of the black student population at Bragg Middle and more than\n\n25 percent of the black student population at Gardendale High. Students from the\n\nunincorporated and predominantly white community of Mount Olive as well as\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f             Case: 17-12338       Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 10 of 61\n\n\nstudents from the more integrated Town of Brookside and City of Graysville also\n\nattend the middle and high schools in Gardendale. Dozens of black students have\n\ntaken advantage of the majority-to-minority transfer provision in the 1971 order to\n\nattend schools in Gardendale. For example, from 2009 to 2016, anywhere from 12\n\nto 22 black students attended Gardendale High annually as transfer students. After\n\nthe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq., required public\n\nschool boards to permit students attending schools “identified for school\n\nimprovement” to transfer to schools not so identified, 20 U.S.C. § 6316 (repealed\n\n2015), the district court also amended the 1971 order to permit some black students\n\nfrom less successful schools to transfer to Snow Rogers Elementary and Bragg\n\nMiddle. Because of capacity issues, the district court permitted only 12 students to\n\ntransfer to Bragg Middle for each of the relevant years. In sum, Gardendale schools\n\nare racially diverse institutions in an otherwise white enclave in large part because\n\nzoning and desegregation transfer opportunities permit other Jefferson County\n\nstudents to attend the schools.\n\n      Against this backdrop, four individuals, Tim Bagwell, Chris Lucas, David\n\nSalters, and Chris Segroves, launched a campaign to create a municipal school\n\nsystem for Gardendale. Segroves later became the president of the Gardendale\n\nBoard. Lucas became a member of the Board. And Bagwell and Salters served on\n\nan advisory board.\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 11 of 61\n\n\n      As part of their campaign, Bagwell, Lucas, and Salters created and\n\nmaintained a Facebook page titled “Gardendale City Schools.” The page was\n\npublicly accessible, but the secession leaders served as page administrators with\n\nthe ability to approve new members, delete posts, and change the privacy settings.\n\n      From the start, the secession leaders expressed concern about the changing\n\ndemographics of the Gardendale schools. Salters explained in one post that the\n\npopulation of the predominantly white City of Gardendale looked different from\n\nthe more diverse student population at the Gardendale schools: “A look around at\n\nour community sporting events, our churches are great snapshots of our\n\ncommunity. A look into our schools, and you’ll see something totally different.”\n\nBagwell alluded to those demographic differences when he listed among the\n\nbenefits of a municipal system, “better control over the geographic composition of\n\nthe student body [and] protection against the actions of other jurisdictions that\n\nmight not be in our best interests.”\n\n      The secession leaders argued that a separate school system would give the\n\nresidents of Gardendale greater control over their children’s education, improve the\n\nacademic quality of the schools, and permit Gardendale “to control [its] own\n\nrevenue stream.” But the secession leaders never met with representatives of the\n\nJefferson County Board to discuss their grievances, and they struggled to identify\n\nspecific deficiencies in the County schools. Segroves testified that he “had no\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 12 of 61\n\n\ninvolvement in the schools in Jefferson County prior to . . . serving on the\n\n[Gardendale] [B]oard.” When asked to identify “specific changes that [he] would\n\nmake if [Gardendale] were allowed to separate,” Salters replied, “Just overall\n\nimprovements, general improvements of education which are reflected in the size\n\nof the school system.” And Bagwell stated that “at least historically in many areas,\n\nincluding Alabama, a smaller system with individual local control, historically they\n\ntend to perform better academically than larger systems.” He added that a\n\nmunicipal school system “seems to be a component for a vital community with\n\nhigher-than-average growth and desirability.”\n\n      The secession leaders and others frequently blamed “non-residents,”\n\nparticularly students from the predominantly black community of North\n\nSmithfield, for allegedly draining resources from the Gardendale schools. In\n\nresponse to a suggestion that racial concerns were animating the movement, Salters\n\nstated in a Facebook post that “non-resident students are increasing at a [sic]\n\nalarming rate in our schools.” “They consume the resources of our schools, our\n\nteachers and our resident students, then go home” without “contribut[ing]\n\nfinancially.” He stated that he would “welcome those students,” but only if they\n\n“move to Gardendale or pay a transfer fee.” One online participant put it more\n\nbluntly: “[D]id you know we are sending school buses to Center point [sic] and\n\nbusing kids to OUR schools in Gardendale, as well as from Smithville!” That\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 13 of 61\n\n\nparticipant stated that some of the transfer students “have been bused here for years\n\ndue to the desegregation from decades ago and that should have already been\n\nchanged because we have a very diverse population now in our area.” The\n\nparticipant said, “We are busting at the seams and can’t continue on this path!”\n\nSalters expressed similar concerns: “We are using buses to transport non-residents\n\ninto our schools (without additional funding) from as far away as Center Point\n\n(there’s your redistribution of wealth).”\n\n      Secession supporters frequently derided the City of Center Point, a\n\npredominantly black community that used to be a predominantly white community\n\nand has no municipal school system. In 1970, Center Point was over 99 percent\n\nwhite, but by 2010, about 33 percent of Center Point was white and 63 percent was\n\nblack. When comparing Gardendale to Center Point, secession leaders warned\n\nresidents that if they failed to act, Gardendale would follow a similar trajectory.\n\nFor example, at a public meeting, Salters stated, “It likely will not turn out well for\n\nGardendale if we don’t do this. We don’t want to become what” Center Point has\n\nbecome. And an online participant asked, “[W]ould you like to live in Center Point\n\nor Adamsville?” She “encourage[d] [another online participant] to ride around\n\nthose areas, maybe even Pinson or Huffman and think about how quickly an area’s\n\ndemographics change.” She added, “This is about a community wanting to\n\nprogress, not regress.”\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 14 of 61\n\n\n      In contrast with their comments about Center Point, the secession leaders\n\ntouted the predominantly white community of Mount Olive as a desirable area to\n\nbe included in the new school system. In a post on Facebook, Lucas contrasted the\n\nintended treatment of Mount Olive with that of “minorities.” In response to a\n\nquestion about the impact of “[f]ederal desegregation laws” on the proposed\n\nsecession, he explained that minorities not residing in Gardendale would not be\n\nstudents in the new system, but that Gardendale might annex Mount Olive:\n\n      1) Will kids in North Gardendale (who may currently be zoned for\n      county schools in Morris) be zoned for a city school system? Yes. All\n      kids within the municipal boundaries of Gardendale would go to\n      schools within the new system.\n\n      2) Would Gardendale be required to bring in minorities from outside\n      of the municipal boundaries to achieve some sort of quota? No. The\n      school system is for residents of Gardendale (whatever those\n      boundaries end up being and whatever that racial make-up is). The\n      idea is that it might include an expansion to include an annexation of\n      certain parts of Mount Olive.\nIndeed, the secession leaders and others regularly discussed the status of Mount\n\nOlive, though practical obstacles related to the local fire district ultimately\n\nthwarted their intended plans.\n\n      Eventually, the secession leaders “began having conversations with the\n\nmayor . . . and the council . . ., and [they] got their backing because any kind of\n\nofficial actions would obviously have to occur through the city, and then the city\n\ncommission.” Lucas explained that “[a]t the end of the day, [city officials have] got\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 15 of 61\n\n\nto drive the official efforts, but it really became a ground swell of a movement and\n\nthat was how the whole idea was born.” According to Lucas, he and Salters “put\n\nthe mayor and the council in a head lock until they came to their own conclusions\n\nthat the school system had to happen.”\n\n      In October 2012, the Gardendale City Council commissioned Dr. Ira Harvey\n\nto study the feasibility of a Gardendale school system. Harvey concluded that the\n\nsecession was possible based on estimates that included students from\n\npredominantly white Mount Olive but did not include students from predominantly\n\nblack North Smithfield. Harvey’s conclusion stemmed, in large part, from his\n\ndetermination that the municipal school system would acquire debt-free the $51\n\nmillion Gardendale high-school facility, which though located in the City of\n\nGardendale was financed and constructed by Jefferson County. The siting of the\n\nschool was proposed by the Jefferson County Board to the plaintiffs and the United\n\nStates, and the parties agreed that the high school would serve as a regional\n\neducational facility with a career technical program to foster voluntary\n\ndesegregation by encouraging high-school students to enroll in programs outside of\n\ntheir zoned schools. According to the Jefferson County superintendent, Dr. Warren\n\nPouncey, the high school currently serves students who reside in about five\n\ndifferent high school zones.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 16 of 61\n\n\n      While Harvey was performing the feasibility study, the secession leaders\n\nformed a nonprofit entity called Future of Our Community Utilizing Schools\n\n(FOCUS) Gardendale. FOCUS Gardendale existed to raise funds and to lobby for\n\nhigher property taxes to support the proposed school system. FOCUS Gardendale\n\ncirculated a flyer that depicted a white elementary-school student and asked,\n\n“Which path will Gardendale choose?” It then listed several well-integrated or\n\npredominantly black cities that had not formed municipal systems followed by a\n\nlist of predominantly white cities that had. The flyer described the predominantly\n\nwhite communities as “some of the best places to live in the country.”\n\n\n\n\n      The campaign by the secession leaders succeeded. In September 2013, the\n\nCity Council approved a five-mill ad valorem tax, and the citizens of Gardendale\n\n                                         16\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 17 of 61\n\n\nlater voted on a referendum to impose an additional five-mill tax to fund the school\n\nsystem. In 2014, the Council adopted an ordinance that “established a public\n\nschool system for the City of Gardendale, Alabama, to be known as the Gardendale\n\nCity School System.” Gardendale, Ala., Code § 14-1 (2014). The ordinance also\n\ncreated a Board of Education and vested it with the “power, authority and dut[y]”\n\nto, among other things, “maintain and do all things necessary and proper for the\n\nmanagement of the Gardendale City School System.” Id. § 14-4. That same year,\n\nthe Council appointed the first members of the Gardendale Board, which, under\n\nstate law, could include only Gardendale residents. See Ala. Code § 16-11-2(b).\n\nAlthough the Council received applications from black residents of Gardendale,\n\nthe five members selected were all white.\n\n      The Gardendale Board immediately hired Dr. Patrick Martin to serve as\n\nsuperintendent. Martin had no prior experience operating under a desegregation\n\norder, none of the school districts where he has previously worked was more than\n\n15 percent black, and over his 17-year career as an administrator and educator, he\n\nhas never hired a black teacher, worked with a black teacher, or hired a black\n\nadministrator. When he sent the Gardendale Board an email update to help it\n\n“understand the lens through which the Plaintiff Parties may view [the]\n\n[s]eparation,” he quoted a book he was reading that compared the income\n\ndistribution of black people in 1970 and today. He stated that about the same\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 18 of 61\n\n\npercentage of black people live in poverty today and that, according to the book,\n\n“[m]uch of the progress that was the source of such optimism a generation ago has\n\nbeen lost in the current generation.”\n\n      Superintendent Martin drafted a secession plan in the fall of 2014. An early\n\nplan provided that all of the non-resident students who currently attend the four\n\nschools in Gardendale, including students from North Smithfield and other\n\nsurrounding areas, would be phased out of the Gardendale municipal system over a\n\nperiod of 13 years. Superintendent Martin’s plan permitted racial desegregation\n\ntransfer students to attend the Gardendale schools, but it conditioned transfer\n\nopportunities on space availability, tuition payments by means other than personal\n\ncheck, annual reapplications for transfer, and a stipulation that the Gardendale\n\nBoard would not provide transportation to transfer students. Afterward, Segroves,\n\nas president of the Gardendale Board, questioned the need for racial desegregation\n\ntransfers. On a redline version of the plan, he wrote, “Legal team to review and\n\nconfirm its applicability/appropriateness for GBOE [Gardendale Board of\n\nEducation]” next to the racial desegregation provision.\n\n      Although the Gardendale Board never formally approved any plan, it\n\nsubmitted a plan to the district court in December 2015 in support of its motion to\n\nsecede. Like the earlier one, the plan submitted to the district court proposed\n\nredrawing the school attendance lines at the municipal boundaries of Gardendale\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 19 of 61\n\n\nand eliminating, over the course of a 13-year transition period, many of the non-\n\nresident students from the Gardendale schools. But the plan eliminated entirely the\n\nracial desegregation transfer provision.\n\n      The plan provided that North Smithfield students in kindergarten through\n\ntwelfth grade “shall attend the Gardendale Schools on the same basis as\n\nGardendale Students, provided that the County Board or the tax collector for\n\nJefferson County shall pay to the City Board the ad valorem school taxes collected\n\nfrom the North Smithfield Manor and Greenleaf Heights communities.” The plan\n\nprovided no transition period for these students. The Gardendale Board vaguely\n\nalleged in its motion to secede that “North Smithfield Manor and Greenleaf\n\nHeights students will be able to attend Gardendale Schools for the indefinite\n\nfuture.” But the Gardendale Board did not consult with the parents of North\n\nSmithfield students before adding this provision. In fact, Superintendent Martin\n\ndeclined an invitation to attend North Smithfield Community Civic League\n\nmeetings to discuss the proposed secession. And although Martin testified that he\n\nadded the provision, in part, because of “the importance of educational continuity,”\n\nhe also testified that the change was motivated by a desire to “honor the\n\n[desegregation] order.”\n\n      Some supporters of secession expressed their displeasure at the prospect of\n\nallowing any non-residents to attend the municipal schools. Bagwell defended on\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 20 of 61\n\n\nFacebook permitting the attendance of North Smithfield students as “a specific,\n\ntechnical, tactical decision aimed at addressing a recognized road block to breaking\n\naway.” And he later described that “bitter . . . pill” as something that weighed\n\nagainst the “ultimate . . . goal” of secession:\n\n      You and I may not think that it is particularly fair to accept an out-of-\n      district area not subject to our control or taxation as a price to pay to\n      gain approval for separation, and we would be within reason to feel\n      that way. The extent to which fair has anything to do with it depends\n      on how you weigh your priorities in deciding whether it is too bitter a\n      pill to swallow or if the ultimate treatment goal, i.e. separation, is\n      worth it.\n                      C. The Proceedings in the District Court\n      On March 13, 2015, the Gardendale Board moved to intervene in this action.\n\nAlthough counsel for the Gardendale Board represented that he understood that\n\n“every aspect of [the] operation [of the proposed school system] would have to be\n\nsubmitted to the [district] [c]ourt for review,” the Gardendale Board also filed a\n\ncomplaint in state court requesting that the state court direct the Jefferson County\n\nBoard to relinquish control of the Gardendale schools. The district court later\n\nenjoined the state lawsuit. On December 11, 2015, the Gardendale Board filed a\n\nmotion to operate a municipal school system and attached the 2015 proposed\n\nsecession plan. Black children who currently attend Jefferson County schools were\n\nsubstituted as plaintiffs in the action and opposed the secession. And the City of\n\nGraysville, the Town of Brookside, and two parents from Mount Olive moved for\n\nlimited intervention to oppose the secession.\n\n                                           20\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 21 of 61\n\n\n      The Gardendale Board sought immediate review of its motion to secede\n\neven though the district court was in the process of determining whether judicial\n\nsupervision of Jefferson County continued to be necessary. Counsel for Gardendale\n\nstated, “[I]t is [not] necessary for the [district] [c]ourt to decide whether or not the\n\ncounty has, in fact, achieved full unitary status for the [district] [c]ourt to be able to\n\nrule on [the] motion to be allowed to separate.” And about a year later,\n\nSuperintendent Martin joined representatives of the Department of Justice and\n\nothers for a tour of the schools in the Jefferson County system. After the site visit,\n\nMartin opined in a “Weekly Board Update” to members of the Gardendale Board\n\nthat “if Jefferson County really does aim to gain Unitary Status there is going to be\n\nan excessive amount of work to be done across the entirety of the county and . . .\n\nwe need to do everything to make sure we are not lumped into that process.”\n\n      When the district court ruled on the motion by the Gardendale Board to\n\noperate a municipal school system, the district court made two findings of fact.\n\nFirst, it found that the Gardendale Board violated the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment because “race was a motivating factor in Gardendale’s\n\ndecision to separate from the Jefferson County public school system.” Second, it\n\nfound that “Gardendale ha[d] not established that its separation will not impede\n\nJefferson County’s effort to obtain a court order dissolving the . . . desegregation\n\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 22 of 61\n\n\norder.” But the district court then sua sponte invoked its equitable authority to craft\n\na new secession plan based on “a number of practical considerations.”\n\n      The district court found that the supporters of secession from the outset\n\nacted with a racially discriminatory purpose. It found that “some Gardendale\n\ncitizens are concerned because the racial demographics in Gardendale are shifting,\n\nand they worry that Gardendale, like its neighbor Center Point, may become a\n\npredominantly black city.” The district court found that they “prefer a\n\npredominantly white city” and support a municipal school system because it would\n\nallow them to eliminate non-resident black students from the Gardendale schools.\n\nThe district court found that concerns about the “geographic composition” of the\n\nstudent bodies in the Gardendale schools could be traced to the 1971 desegregation\n\norder, which created a Gardendale attendance zone that includes North Smithfield\n\nand provides for desegregation transfer opportunities. The district court found that\n\nthe secession leaders preferred that the Gardendale schools serve only the\n\npredominantly white students that reside in Gardendale and Mount Olive. The\n\ndistrict court also explained that although at least one Facebook comment\n\nostensibly blamed the No Child Left Behind Act for capacity and other issues at\n\nthe Gardendale schools, most of the transfer students attending the Gardendale\n\nschools were desegregation transfer students. So the children “who look ‘totally\n\ndifferent’ from the children who attend churches in Gardendale or play on ball\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f              Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 23 of 61\n\n\nfields there are students from the North Smithfield community . . . and transfer\n\nstudents from areas like Center Point who attend Gardendale schools pursuant to\n\nthe . . . desegregation order.”\n\n      The district court found that the secession leaders recognized that if they\n\nwanted to “maintain the geographic integrity of the Gardendale zone,” they had to\n\n“translate their grassroots effort into official action.” Different versions of the\n\nsecession plan imposed conditions that the district court “reasonably infer[red]”\n\nwere “designed to minimize or eliminate racial desegregation transfers.” The plan\n\nattached to the motion to secede would have eliminated all racial desegregation\n\ntransfer students. Earlier drafts conditioned transfer opportunities on space\n\navailability, which would effectively eliminate Gardendale Elementary and Bragg\n\nMiddle as potential transferee schools. And the last plan submitted to the district\n\ncourt provided that transfer opportunities would be provided “subject to space\n\navailability” and that transportation would not be provided “unless required by\n\nfederal courts.”\n\n      The district court explained that none of these plans had been approved by\n\nthe Gardendale Board and that Superintendent Martin was “unable to say which, if\n\nany, of his draft transfer policies the Gardendale Board ultimately would be willing\n\nto implement.” The district court found that “[t]his official action—or lack\n\nthereof—dovetails with the separation organizers’ expressed interest in eliminating\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 24 of 61\n\n\nfrom the [Gardendale] schools . . . students who are bussed into Gardendale from\n\nother areas of Jefferson County.”\n\n      The district court found that the treatment of the North Smithfield students\n\nin the various draft plans suggested that the Gardendale Board would permit those\n\nstudents to attend Gardendale schools only if required by a federal-court order.\n\nEven though North Smithfield students have attended the Gardendale schools since\n\n1971, the Gardendale Board sought to exclude them entirely in an early draft of the\n\nsecession plan. The Gardendale Board “recalculated after it realized that the\n\nelimination of the North Smithfield students might jeopardize the separation\n\neffort.” And comments referring to the change in the December 2015 plan as a\n\n“specific, technical, tactical decision aimed at addressing a recognized road block\n\nto breaking away” confirmed the motivation behind that decision.\n\n      The district court also found that the Gardendale Board had not voted on a\n\nplan because it “ha[d] been waiting to see whether its attorneys could persuade the\n\n[district] [c]ourt that the 1971 desegregation order does not govern Gardendale’s\n\nseparation.” If the district court ruled that the order no longer governs municipal\n\nsecessions, then the Gardendale Board would not need to ensure any racial\n\ndiversity in its schools. And even if the district court ruled that the order still\n\ngoverns secessions, the Gardendale Board would condition the attendance of North\n\nSmithfield students on the remittance of ad valorem tax dollars from Jefferson\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 25 of 61\n\n\nCounty because the desegregation order provides the “mechanism that makes those\n\ntax dollars flow to Gardendale.” So if the desegregation order were dissolved in the\n\nfuture, the North Smithfield students “would have no assurance that [the\n\nGardendale Board] would allow them to continue to attend Gardendale schools.”\n\nIn other words, even though the secession leaders originally planned to permit\n\nstudents from Mount Olive, a predominantly white community, to attend the\n\nGardendale schools, the Gardendale Board refused to “ma[k]e a meaningful,\n\nbinding commitment to the children in North Smithfield.” The district court found\n\nthat “the Gardendale Board is trying to evade the [district] [c]ourt’s desegregation\n\norder because some citizens in Gardendale want to eliminate from Gardendale\n\nschools the black students whom Jefferson County transports to schools in\n\nGardendale.”\n\n      The district court rejected the argument of the Gardendale Board that our\n\npredecessor circuit ruled that Jefferson County had achieved unitary status in Stout\n\nIII. It explained that Stout III used the term “unitary” to describe student\n\nassignments in Jefferson County, not the status of its desegregation efforts. And it\n\nrejected the argument that “desegregation orders are outmoded” because “age\n\nalone does not render the [1971] order unenforceable.” It also explained that it\n\n“reasonably infer[red] from Gardendale’s litigation strategy and from the\n\nSuperintendent’s statement that Jefferson County has to do ‘an excessive amount\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 26 of 61\n\n\nof work’ to fulfill the obligations of the desegregation order that Gardendale does\n\nnot genuinely believe that Jefferson County currently is eligible for a release from\n\nfederal supervision.” But although the district court determined that the 1971 order\n\nwas still in effect, it ruled that the “one-third requirement” that prompted the\n\ninclusion of North Smithfield in the secession plan was unenforceable under\n\ncurrent law because it involved an unlawful racial quota.\n\n      The district court found that the secession of Gardendale would impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board in three ways. First, it\n\nconsidered the “post-separation racial demographics.” It acknowledged that “[b]y\n\nGardendale’s numbers, the municipal system will be more desegregated at the\n\nconclusion of the [transition] period” because the Gardendale Board will “phase\n\nout more white students than black students.” But it found that the transition period\n\n“makes the ultimate racial composition of the Gardendale district difficult to\n\nforecast because so much may change over 13 years.” The district court found that\n\na new school system would likely have a higher percentage of white students than\n\nthe statistics offered by the Gardendale Board suggest because predominantly\n\nwhite communities likely would be annexed by Gardendale. The district court also\n\nacknowledged that the impact on the Jefferson County school system “may seem\n\ninsignificant at first blush.” It found that if Gardendale seceded and the new school\n\nsystem included only Gardendale students, the overall student population in the\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 27 of 61\n\n\nJefferson County school system would become 1.8 percent more black. And if\n\nNorth Smithfield students were zoned for the Gardendale schools, the Jefferson\n\nCounty student population would become 1.5 percent more black. But it\n\nunderscored the “cumulative impact of municipal separations and annexations on\n\nJefferson County’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the desegregation order.”\n\nIt found that the “series of municipal separations in Jefferson County has\n\nrepeatedly shifted the geographic, demographic, and economic characteristics of\n\nthe Jefferson County district, making it difficult” for the Jefferson County Board to\n\ncomply with the desegregation order and for the district court to evaluate its\n\ncompliance. And it found that the “[t]he direct impact of the separation” would be\n\nto force displaced students to attend more segregated schools. The district court\n\nstressed that middle and high school students, in particular, would be forced to\n\nattend schools that are between 85 percent and 99 percent white or black.\n\n      Second, the district court underscored the importance of Gardendale High to\n\nthe desegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board, and it found that its loss\n\nwould cause the Jefferson County Board to have fewer funds to invest in other\n\nfacilities and programming. It explained that the Jefferson County Board invested\n\nin the magnet program in the high school and located it in Gardendale to encourage\n\nvoluntary desegregation and satisfy its obligations under the 1971 order. If the\n\nJefferson County Board were to forfeit the high school facility, it would lose the\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 28 of 61\n\n\nuse of this important “desegregatory tool[].” And the district court added that the\n\nother schools in Gardendale have also “played an important role in Jefferson\n\nCounty’s desegregation efforts” because their location makes it “relatively\n\nconvenient” for black students to take advantage of desegregation transfer\n\nopportunities. If desegregation transfer students could no longer attend those\n\nschools, black students might be less willing to transfer at all.\n\n      Third, the district court explained that the words and actions of the secession\n\nleaders and the Gardendale Board “communicated messages of inferiority and\n\nexclusion” to black schoolchildren. It quoted the “belittling language of exclusion”\n\non the public Facebook page. It described the FOCUS Gardendale flyer that\n\n“ask[ed] Gardendale voters if they would rather live in an affluent white city or a\n\nformerly white city that now is well-integrated or predominantly black.” And it\n\nexplained that the Gardendale Board not only failed to disavow those messages of\n\ninferiority but instead reinforced them. The Gardendale superintendent never\n\nconferred with the parents of North Smithfield students even though he was in\n\nregular communication with Gardendale residents; he ignored reports that\n\nGardendale residents were upset that North Smithfield students would be allowed\n\nto attend the Gardendale schools; and the Gardendale Board never voted on any\n\nplan that would give North Smithfield students some meaningful assurance that\n\nthey could continue to attend the Gardendale schools. The district court found that\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 29 of 61\n\n\n“[t]he messages of inferiority in the record in this case assail the dignity of black\n\nschool children.”\n\n      Despite finding that the Gardendale Board sought to secede for racially\n\ndiscriminatory reasons and that the secession would impede the desegregation\n\nefforts of the Jefferson County Board, the district court sua sponte devised and\n\npermitted a partial secession that effectively amended the 1971 desegregation\n\norder, and it listed four “practical considerations” to support its decision. First, it\n\nexplained that if it prohibited the secession, Gardendale families and students “may\n\nblame students from North Smithfield for Gardendale’s inability to operate a\n\nmunicipal system.” Second, it explained that it had to consider the interests of the\n\nstudents and parents in other parts of Jefferson County, and it stated that it “would\n\nbe reluctant to [release Jefferson County from federal supervision] if the\n\nGardendale zone remains in the Jefferson County district, given the evidence of\n\nracial motivation in this case.” In contrast, permitting the secession would allow\n\nthe district court to “tailor supervision to the particular needs of the county district\n\nand the municipal district.” Third, it stated that it “must, to the extent practicable,\n\nhonor the wishes of parents who support a local system simply because they want\n\ngreater control over their children’s education.” And fourth, it noted that it “may\n\nconsider the interests of” students from Mount Olive and the other communities\n\nthat would be directly affected by the secession.\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 30 of 61\n\n\n      The district court permitted the Gardendale Board to operate the two\n\nelementary schools in Gardendale and stated that the schools must be zoned for\n\nstudents residing within the Gardendale City limits. Elementary students from\n\nNorth Smithfield must be zoned for another Jefferson County elementary school.\n\nThe district court also directed counsel for all parties to develop and submit to the\n\ndistrict court a proposed desegregation order “tailored to the specific circumstances\n\nof the Gardendale City Schools System.” And it added that the proposal should\n\n“redraw the lines for Snow Rogers and Gardendale Elementary to address capacity\n\nissues at Gardendale Elementary.” The district court then explained that it would\n\nconsider a renewed motion by the Gardendale Board for the operation of all city\n\nschools, “Kindergarten through 12,” in three years if the Gardendale Board\n\noperated the two elementary schools “in good faith compliance with the anticipated\n\ndesegregation order.”\n\n      The district court ordered counsel for all parties to develop a proposed\n\nfacilities plan for the students attending Bragg Middle and Gardendale High. The\n\nplan would either place Gardendale High under the control of Jefferson County or\n\nplace the high school facility in “an anticipated K-12 Gardendale district.” In that\n\ncase, the Gardendale Board would have to make an “appropriate payment” to the\n\nJefferson County Board to help fund another facility. The Jefferson County Board\n\nmust retain the middle and high schools until the district court orders otherwise.\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 31 of 61\n\n\nAnd the Jefferson County Board must permit middle and high school students from\n\nNorth Smithfield to attend a school of their choice for the 2017–18 academic year.\n\nThe plaintiffs, the United States, and the Jefferson County Board must then submit\n\na joint proposal for the permanent zoning of the students. The district court also\n\nordered the Gardendale City Council to appoint at least one black resident of\n\nGardendale to the Gardendale Board within 60 days.\n\n      After the plaintiffs moved the district court to reconsider its order, the\n\ndistrict court issued a supplemental opinion that defended its decision. The district\n\ncourt stated that prohibiting the secession might have been appropriate if it had\n\n“recently” issued a desegregation order and “kn[e]w that the [C]ounty, including\n\nGardendale, would be subject to federal supervision for years.” But because the\n\n1971 order was “45 years old, and federal oversight of the Jefferson County Board\n\nof Education may be nearing an end, . . . the [district] [c]ourt decided to place the\n\nGardendale Board under a new desegregation order that creates a fresh start for\n\nfederal supervision of all aspects of the public schools in Gardendale.” Without\n\nthat “new” order, the district court reasoned, the residents of Gardendale could\n\nlater try again to secede after the 1971 order is dissolved. The district court\n\nreasoned that it could not rely on its finding of a discriminatory purpose to prevent\n\na future secession because it “must weigh the possibility that the plaintiff class\n\nwould not succeed” in seeking “appropriate judicial review and relief” in the\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 32 of 61\n\n\nfuture. The district court also explained that it was concerned about the resentment\n\nNorth Smithfield students would experience if it enjoined the secession, and it\n\nstressed that North Smithfield students would now benefit from the ability to\n\nchoose the school they attend.\n\n      The district court maintained that its order was tailored to remedy the\n\nconstitutional violation by the Gardendale Board and restored those harmed to the\n\nposition they would have occupied had the violation not occurred. It stated that its\n\norder would reduce costs to the Jefferson County Board, give the Jefferson County\n\nBoard certainty, allow the residents of Gardendale and Jefferson County to “heal\n\nfrom this dispute,” and send a message “that any community contemplating\n\nseparation at the expense of Jefferson County’s desegregation efforts will pay a\n\nhigh price and will have no guarantee that the community will be able to separate.”\n\n      The district court gave special weight to the interests of black Gardendale\n\nresidents who supported the secession. It defended its decision to consider the\n\nmotivations of Gardendale residents who supported the secession for nonracial\n\nreasons on the ground that “the residents whom the [district] [c]ourt had in mind\n\nare African-American.” It later stated that it must consider the “message” that it\n\nwill send to black parents if it prohibits the secession and forces them to choose\n\nbetween “having their African-American children attend a public school system\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 33 of 61\n\n\nthat these parents consider deficient or of moving to a municipal system elsewhere\n\nin Jefferson County that will give these parents the control that they desire.”\n\n      The district court also revisited its finding that the secession would impede\n\nthe desegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board. It explained that although\n\n“it does not have a tool available that will enable it to erase the message of\n\ninferiority conveyed by the conduct of the Gardendale Board,” its order mitigated\n\nthe harm from the loss of Gardendale High and the displacement of students that\n\ncurrently attend Gardendale schools. It cited the requirement that Jefferson County\n\nretain control of the high school or receive an “appropriate payment.” And it stated\n\nthat it had “unambiguously signaled that it envisions the creation of a new middle\n\nand high school zone comprised of students” from a number of surrounding\n\ncommunities, including Mount Olive and North Smithfield. “Although the\n\n[district] [c]ourt did not explicitly order” that solution, it stated that its order would\n\ncreate, if implemented, a student population “more diverse” than the current\n\nstudent populations of the Gardendale middle and high schools.\n\n      In response to the plaintiffs’ argument that the district court was bound by\n\nprecedent and the law-of-the-case doctrine to deny the motion to secede, the\n\ndistrict court declared that Stout I was overruled or simply inapplicable. It stated\n\nthat Wright overruled the holding in Stout I that a district court must prohibit a\n\nsecession if it finds that the secession will impede the desegregation efforts of a\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f                Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 34 of 61\n\n\nlarger school district. And, in the alternative, the district court stated that it\n\n“believes that both the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court\n\nwould find that the age of this case diminishes the likelihood that Gardendale’s\n\nseparation would impede the county’s effort to fulfill its desegregation\n\nobligations.”\n\n                           II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n       “In school desegregation cases, we review de novo the district court’s\n\ninterpretation and application of the law,” and we review its factual findings for\n\nclear error. Holton v. City of Thomasville Sch. Dist., 425 F.3d 1325, 1336 (11th\n\nCir. 2005). “Clear error is a highly deferential standard of review.” Id. at 1350\n\n(discussing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)). We may reverse a factual\n\nfinding “only if the finding is clearly erroneous, is based on clearly erroneous\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact, or is based on an erroneous view of the law.” Id.\n\n(quoting Barber v. Int’l Bhd. of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths,\n\nForgers & Helpers, 778 F.2d 750, 754 (11th Cir. 1985)). We review evidentiary\n\nrulings and the validity of an equitable remedy for abuse of discretion. See United\n\nStates v. Dortch, 696 F.3d 1104, 1110 (11th Cir. 2012) (evidentiary rulings); U.S.\n\nEqual Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n v. St. Joseph’s Hosp., Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1343\n\n(11th Cir. 2016) (equitable remedies); see also Stell v. Savannah-Chatham Cty.

DISCUSSION\n\n      We divide our discussion in three parts. First, we explain that the district\n\ncourt did not clearly err when it found that the Gardendale Board moved to secede\n\nfor a racially discriminatory purpose. Second, we explain that the district court did\n\nnot clearly err when it found, in the alternative, that the secession would impede\n\nthe desegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board. Third, we explain that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it permitted the partial secession of the\n\nGardendale Board.\n\n        A. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err When It Found That the\n         Gardendale Board Moved To Secede for a Racially Discriminatory\n                                      Purpose.\n\n      The Equal Protection Clause provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any\n\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend.\n\nXIV, § 1. A facially neutral action by a state actor violates the Equal Protection\n\nClause if it is done for a racially discriminatory purpose. I.L. v. Alabama, 739 F.3d\n\n1273, 1277–78 (11th Cir. 2014). A discriminatory purpose exists if “racial\n\ndiscrimination was a substantial or motivating factor behind enactment of the law.”\n\nId. at 1286 (alteration adopted) (quoting Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 228\n\n(1985)). The Supreme Court has explained that “[d]etermining whether invidious\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 36 of 61\n\n\ndiscriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into\n\nsuch circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” Vill. of\n\nArlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977). Courts\n\nmay consider the racial “impact of the official action,” the “historical background\n\nof the decision,” the “specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged\n\ndecision,” procedural or substantive “departures from the normal” sequence, and\n\n“legislative or administrative history.” Id. at 266–68.\n\n      We review a finding of a racially discriminatory purpose for clear error. See\n\nHolton, 425 F.3d at 1350. “If the district court’s account of the evidence is\n\nplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not\n\nreverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it\n\nwould have weighed the evidence differently.” Id. at 1351 (quoting Anderson v.\n\nCity of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573–74 (1985)). The existence of conflicting\n\nevidence is not sufficient to overturn a finding of fact if it is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. Id. at 1354; see also id. at 1353 (“The district court was not\n\nobliged to recite and analyze individually each and every piece of evidence\n\npresented by the parties.”). We may reverse only if, after reviewing the evidence in\n\nits entirety, we are “left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\n\nbeen committed.” Id. at 1350 (quoting Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573).\n\n\n\n\n                                           36\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 37 of 61\n\n\n      The district court relied on relevant circumstantial and direct evidence to\n\nsupport its finding. The district court considered the “specific sequence of events\n\nleading up to the challenged decision” when it reviewed the public comments\n\nmade by the secession supporters. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267. And it\n\nreasonably inferred that the secession leaders expressed “a desire to control the\n\nracial demographics of the four public schools in the City of Gardendale and the\n\nracial demographics of the city itself.” The district court also considered the\n\n“legislative [and] administrative history,” id. at 268, of the secession proposals and\n\nreasonably inferred that the secession leaders translated their discriminatory\n\npurpose into official action. That is, the Gardendale Board and its superintendent\n\ndevised secession plans that reflect the same desire to control the racial\n\ndemographics of the public schools as had been expressed by the secession leaders.\n\n      The Gardendale Board argues that the district court erred by imputing the\n\ndiscriminatory intent of private individuals to state actors, that the statements of\n\nprivate citizens are irrelevant, and that some of the statements should not have\n\nbeen admitted because they were not authenticated. The Gardendale Board also\n\nargues that the district court erred when it found that the statements of the private\n\ncitizens were racially discriminatory. We disagree.\n\n      To be sure, only a state actor can violate the Fourteenth Amendment, but\n\nconstituent statements and conduct can be relevant in determining the intent of\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 38 of 61\n\n\npublic officials. In Arlington Heights, the Supreme Court explained that\n\n“[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor\n\ndemands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent\n\nas may be available.” Id. at 266. And as examples of the type of evidence that may\n\nbe considered, it listed the “historical background” of a decision and the “specific\n\nsequence of events leading up to the challenged decision.” Id. at 267. For example,\n\nwe have relied on evidence about the work of private lobbyists to hold that a\n\ndistrict court did not clearly err when it ruled that two state constitutional\n\namendments were “financially, and not discriminatorily, motivated.” I.L., 739 F.3d\n\nat 1287. The district court in I.L. made its finding based on a record of “massive\n\nresistance to substantial property tax increases; heavy support from the Alabama\n\nFarm Bureau Federation, a powerful lobbying organization; and a clash between\n\nrural and urban interests.” Id. at 1287 (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted). And in Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Supreme Court\n\naffirmed a finding that a voter initiative was motivated by a discriminatory purpose\n\nbased on statements made by citizen sponsors and proponents. 458 U.S. 457, 471\n\n(1982); see also City of Cuyahoga Falls v. Buckeye Cmty. Hope Found., 538 U.S.\n\n188, 196–97 (2003) (“[S]tatements made by decisionmakers or referendum\n\nsponsors during deliberation over a referendum may constitute relevant evidence\n\nof discriminatory intent in a challenge to an ultimately enacted initiative.”).\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 39 of 61\n\n\n      We recognize that the Supreme Court has cautioned against relying on\n\n“allegedly discriminatory voter sentiment” to find that “official acts were\n\nthemselves motivated by racial animus” when there is no “show[ing] that the\n\nvoters’ sentiments can be attributed . . . to the state actors,” Cuyahoga Falls, 538\n\nU.S. at 195–97, but here that showing was made. The district court did not find that\n\n“statements made by private individuals . . ., in and of themselves, constitute[d]\n\nstate action for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 196 (citation\n\nomitted). Nor did it, as the Gardendale Board argues, impermissibly ascribe the\n\nracially discriminatory motivations of a few to the actions of the Gardendale Board\n\nas a whole. The district court instead understood that the statements of those who\n\nplayed a primary role in lobbying for the state action “translate[d] their grassroots\n\neffort into official action.” And the secession leaders became members of the\n\nGardendale Board and advisory board. They testified that they “began having\n\nconversations with the mayor . . . and the council,” and that they “put the mayor\n\nand the council in a head lock until they came to their own conclusions that the\n\nschool system had to happen.” They lobbied the Gardendale City Council to\n\nimpose a five-mill tax, and they spearheaded the referendum initiative to impose an\n\nadditional five-mill tax. Their statements and actions directly bear on the purpose\n\nof the Gardendale Board.\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 40 of 61\n\n\n      The Gardendale Board argues that the Facebook comments were improperly\n\nadmitted because they are irrelevant, but this circumstantial evidence easily\n\nsatisfies Federal Rule of Evidence 401 because the comments shed light on the\n\nmotivations behind the creation and later actions of the Gardendale Board. Most of\n\nthe Facebook posts cited by the district court were made by the secession leaders\n\nwho spearheaded the movement and later became members of the Gardendale\n\nBoard and its advisory board. And because the other posts were made on a\n\nFacebook page controlled by the secession leaders, those posts too are relevant in\n\ndetermining the intent of the secession leaders. The secession leaders were able to\n\ndelete posts, approve or reject individuals who sought to join the page, block\n\nindividuals who were previously approved to post on the page, and change the\n\nprivacy settings of the page. Admitting this evidence was well within the “wide\n\ndiscretion [of the district court to] determin[e] the relevance of evidence produced\n\nat trial.” Cabello v. Fernández-Larios, 402 F.3d 1148, 1161 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n      The Gardendale Board argues that the Facebook comments were\n\ninadmissible because they were not authenticated, but that argument is meritless.\n\n“To authenticate a document,” Federal Rule of Evidence 901 “only requires a\n\nproponent to present ‘sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case that the\n\nproffered evidence is what it purports to be.’” United States v. Lebowitz, 676 F.3d\n\n1000, 1009 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Belfast, 611 F.3d 783, 819\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 41 of 61\n\n\n(11th Cir. 2010)). We have explained that “[a] district court has discretion to\n\ndetermine authenticity, and that determination should not be disturbed on appeal\n\nabsent a showing that there is no competent evidence in the record to support it.”\n\nId. (quoting United States v. Siddiqui, 235 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir. 2000)). The\n\nFacebook posts were the contents of a page that was controlled by the secession\n\nleaders and used to advocate for the proposed secession. And the posts were\n\nproperly authenticated for that purpose. For example, the Gardendale Board\n\nconceded that the posts by someone with the username Chris Lucas were made by\n\nChris Lucas. Tim Bagwell admitted that he was an active poster and made one of\n\nthe comments ascribed to him. And David Salters likewise admitted to\n\nparticipating in some of the Facebook discussions. Of course, the Gardendale\n\nBoard was free to challenge the weight given to the Facebook posts, but they were\n\nplainly admissible.\n\n      Finally, the Gardendale Board argues that the district court clearly erred\n\nwhen it found that the online comments prove discriminatory intent. It maintains\n\nthat the comments have no racially discriminatory subtext and prove only that the\n\nresidents of Gardendale wanted “to improve test scores, shrink class sizes, and\n\nreduce the number of students whose parents do not pay Gardendale property\n\ntaxes.” We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 42 of 61\n\n\n      The findings by the district court are more than “plausible in light of the\n\nrecord viewed in its entirety,” and we would “overstep[] the bounds of [our] duty\n\nunder [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 52(a)” if we reversed—even if we were\n\n“convinced that [we] would have decided the case differently.” Holton, 425 F.3d at\n\n1351. As an appellate court, we do not have the luxury of deciding factual issues\n\nde novo. We affirm the finding that the Gardendale Board acted with a racially\n\ndiscriminatory purpose because that finding is amply supported by this record.\n\n        B. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err When It Found That the\n       Secession of Gardendale Would Impede the Desegregation Efforts of the\n                              Jefferson County Board.\n\n      In the alternative, the district court found that the secession of Gardendale\n\nwould impede efforts to desegregate the schools operated by the Jefferson County\n\nBoard. The Gardendale Board challenges that finding by arguing that the Jefferson\n\nCounty schools have already achieved unitary status and that, in any event, the\n\nsecession would not impede the desegregation efforts of the Jefferson County\n\nBoard. These arguments fail.\n\n                1. Jefferson County Has Not Achieved Unitary Status.\n      The Gardendale Board argues that Jefferson County has already been\n\ndeclared unitary, but to support that argument, the Gardendale Board recites a few\n\nout-of-context statements from the decision of our predecessor circuit in Stout III.\n\nFor example, in Stout III, the former Fifth Circuit stated that “the former dual\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 43 of 61\n\n\nschool system [in Jefferson County] has been effectively dismantled and a unitary\n\nsystem substituted,” and later, it added that the district court found that “in\n\nJefferson County[,] the uprooting of which the Court spoke has been done and a\n\nunitary system is operating.” 537 F.2d at 802; see also id. at 803 (“[O]ur guiding\n\nlights are the trial court’s conclusions that the Jefferson County system has been\n\neffectively desegregated and is unitary and that these three one-race schools are the\n\nproducts of geography and demography alone.”). But both the Supreme Court and\n\nthis Court have cautioned against reading these kinds of statements out of context.\n\nThe whole of the Stout III opinion makes clear that Jefferson County has not fully\n\nfulfilled its desegregation obligations and remains subject to judicial oversight.\n\n      The Gardendale Board confuses two uses of the term “unitary,” a mistake\n\nthe Supreme Court identified in Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public\n\nSchools v. Dowell when it explained that “lower courts have been inconsistent in\n\ntheir use of the term ‘unitary.’” 498 U.S. 237, 245 (1991). Our predecessor circuit\n\ndid not rule that the school system had achieved “unitary status,” a declaration that\n\nwould be appropriate only if it had “eliminated the vestiges of its prior\n\ndiscrimination and ha[d] been adjudicated as such through the proper judicial\n\nprocedures.” Id. (quoting Ga. State Branches of NAACP v. Georgia, 775 F.2d\n\n1403, 1413 n.12 (11th Cir. 1985)). It meant instead that the school system “ha[d]\n\ncurrently desegregated student assignments,” whether or not “vestiges of past\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f               Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 44 of 61\n\n\ndiscrimination” still remained. Id. Although the former Fifth Circuit stated that the\n\nJefferson County schools were no longer formally segregated, it also ruled that the\n\nschool system “must continue under the scrutiny and surveillance of the district\n\ncourt” and that “it would be appropriate, though [not] require[d] . . ., for the district\n\ncourt to give especial and renewed consideration to the possibility of broadening\n\nand making more attractive its existing majority-to-minority transfer procedures\n\nand to the possibility of enriching and strengthening the curriculum to magnet\n\nlevels” in two facilities. Stout III, 537 F.2d at 803. That mandate of continued\n\njudicial oversight means that our predecessor circuit certainly did not “adjudicate[]\n\n[the unitary status of Jefferson County] through the proper judicial procedures.”\n\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (quoting Ga. State Branches of NAACP, 775 F.2d at 1413\n\nn.12).\n\n         To hold that Stout III declared that Jefferson County had achieved unitary\n\nstatus would contravene the principle that “‘substance, not semantics, must govern’\n\nin remedying school segregation.” Holton, 425 F.3d at 1340 (alteration adopted)\n\n(quoting Swann, 402 U.S. at 31). Stout III “makes clear” that the court did not\n\nintend to make a unitary-status determination, and “thus, it is wholly irrelevant\n\nwhat precise language the . . . court used.” Id. (quoting Lee v. Etowah Cty. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 963 F.2d 1416, 1424 n.9 (11th Cir. 1992)). Indeed, that principle is likely\n\nwhy we explained more than a decade after Stout III that the Jefferson County\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 45 of 61\n\n\nschool system “ha[d] [not] yet been declared unitary.” Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of\n\nBessemer, 808 F.2d 1445, 1446 (11th Cir. 1987).\n\n     2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err When It Found That Permitting\n        Gardendale To Secede Would Impede the Desegregation Efforts of the\n                               Jefferson County Board.\n\n      To determine whether a proposed secession would impede the desegregation\n\nefforts of a larger school district, a district court must consider the effect of the\n\nsecession, Ross v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. (Ross I), 559 F.2d 937, 943, 944 (5th\n\nCir. 1977), and the seceding district “bear[s] a heavy burden to show the lack of\n\ndeleterious effects on desegregation,” Ross II, 583 F.2d at 714; see also Ross I, 559\n\nF.2d at 945 (“[T]he burden remains on [the splinter district] to establish that its\n\nimplementation and operation will meet the tests . . . for permitting newly created\n\ndistricts to come into being for parts of districts already under an ongoing court\n\ndesegregation order.”). To satisfy its burden, the splinter district “must express its\n\nprecise policy positions on each significant facet of school district operation,”\n\nwhich includes all “areas of public school operations or support which the district\n\ncourt may specify as pertinent to the accomplishment of its underlying\n\ndesegregation order.” Ross I, 559 F.2d at 944.\n\n      In Wright, the Supreme Court considered three factors in particular: (1) the\n\npotential change in the racial composition of the city and county schools; (2) the\n\nease of identifying the predominant race of the resulting school systems “by\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 46 of 61\n\n\nreference to the racial composition of teachers and staff, the quality of school\n\nbuildings and equipment, or the organization of sports activities”; and (3) the\n\nmessage the secession would send to black schoolchildren. 407 U.S. at 464–66\n\n(quoting Swann, 402 U.S. at 18). The Supreme Court made clear that “[t]he\n\nweighing of the[] factors to determine their effect upon the process of\n\ndesegregation is a delicate task that is aided by a sensitivity to local conditions, and\n\nthe judgment is primarily the responsibility of the district judge.” Id. at 466; see\n\nalso id. at 466 n.13 (“Because of their proximity to local conditions and the\n\npossible need for further hearings, the courts which originally heard these cases\n\ncan best perform this judicial appraisal.” (quoting Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka,\n\nKan. (Brown II), 349 U.S. 294, 299 (1955))). We will reverse a finding that a\n\nproposed secession will impede desegregation efforts only if the district court\n\nclearly erred. See, e.g., Ross II, 583 F.2d at 715 n.6.\n\n      The district court did not clearly err when it found that the secession of\n\nGardendale would have a substantial adverse effect on the desegregation efforts of\n\nthe Jefferson County Board. The district court provided three rationales for the\n\nfinding: the Gardendale school system would inherit Gardendale High, students\n\ndisplaced from the Gardendale schools would attend less racially diverse schools,\n\nand the secession movement communicated “messages of inferiority” to black\n\nstudents. Together, the three rationales support a finding that the secession will\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\f              Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 47 of 61\n\n\nadversely affect efforts to desegregate Jefferson County. See Holton, 425 F.3d at\n\n1351.\n\n        We cannot fault the finding that the loss of Gardendale High will impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board. Gardendale High houses a\n\nsophisticated career technical program strategically located to attract students from\n\nacross the County. And both the Supreme Court and this Court have endorsed\n\nthese kinds of magnet programs because they “have the advantage of encouraging\n\nvoluntary movement of students within a school district in a pattern that aids\n\ndesegregation on a voluntary basis, without requiring extensive busing and\n\nredrawing of district boundary lines.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 92 (1995);\n\nsee also NAACP, Jacksonville Branch v. Duval Cty. Sch., 273 F.3d 960, 967–68\n\n(11th Cir. 2001) (commending a school board for its use of magnet programs to\n\nencourage desegregation).\n\n        As the district court explained, the Gardendale secession would surely\n\nhinder efforts to desegregate Jefferson County because it would require the\n\nJefferson County Board to forfeit this “desegregatory tool[].” It would give the\n\nGardendale Board control over what could otherwise become, according to the\n\ndistrict court, “one of Jefferson County’s strongest examples of good faith\n\nimplementation of the Stout desegregation order.” The district court reasoned that\n\nunder the December 2015 secession plan, the high school would only have a 54\n\n\n\n                                          47\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 48 of 61\n\n\npercent utilization rate and would likely have a less racially diverse student\n\npopulation. In addition, the secession would not provide desegregation transfer\n\nopportunities, which would mean that black students from the surrounding areas in\n\nJefferson County would be required to travel further to take advantage of that\n\npolicy. The result, as the district court explained, would likely be a decline in\n\nstudents seeking to transfer schools. There would also be an obvious financial\n\neffect from the change in ownership with repercussions for the feasibility of other\n\ndesegregation-related programs. And as we explained in Ross II, the district court\n\nis permitted to consider the “adverse financial [e]ffect [of a secession] on future\n\ndesegregation efforts.” 583 F.2d at 715.\n\n      The Gardendale Board argues that the district court “could have ordered\n\nGardendale to keep th[e] [magnet] program open to County students without\n\npreference for Gardendale residents,” but the burden rested with Gardendale—not\n\nthe district court—to show that its plan would not impede the desegregation efforts\n\nof the Jefferson County Board. Because the Gardendale Board failed to satisfy that\n\nburden, the district court was entitled to find that the change in ownership militated\n\nagainst permitting the secession. See id. at 714.\n\n      Nor did the district court clearly err when it weighed evidence that the\n\nsecession of Gardendale would result in fewer desegregated schools in Jefferson\n\nCounty. The district court found that the secession would force students at Bragg\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 49 of 61\n\n\nMiddle School and Gardendale High School to attend far less racially diverse\n\nschools. For example, the district court found that the student population of one\n\nreceiving school is 99.59 percent white, and the student population of another is\n\n85.33 percent black. We have criticized “racially identifiable” schools, United\n\nStates v. Lowndes Cty. Bd. of Educ., 878 F.2d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir. 1989), and\n\nexplained that courts should consider “student assignments” when determining\n\nwhether a school district has fully remedied the effects of de jure segregation,\n\nNAACP, Jacksonville Branch, 273 F.3d at 966.\n\n      The Gardendale Board misunderstands our precedent when it argues that the\n\ndistrict court was not permitted to consider evidence related to the racial balance of\n\nthe relevant schools. “Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake,” but it\n\nis a valid consideration when “the unlawful de jure policy of a school system has\n\nbeen the cause of the racial imbalance in student attendance.” Freeman v. Pitts,\n\n503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992).\n\n      The third rationale offered by the district court—that permitting the\n\nsecession would send “messages of inferiority” to black schoolchildren—is also\n\nsupported by the law and the record. The district court reasoned that throughout the\n\nsecession effort, “both words and deeds have communicated messages of\n\ninferiority and exclusion.” It cited the Facebook comments, the “flyer bearing a\n\nphotograph of a white student,” the “public rejection of transfer students” by\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 50 of 61\n\n\nGardendale residents, the failure of the Gardendale Board to “disavow[] the\n\nbelittling language of exclusion used by [secession] organizers and supporters,” the\n\ninconsistent treatment of the North Smithfield children in the different draft\n\nsecession plans, the failure of the Gardendale Board to “ma[k]e [a] commitment”\n\nto North Smithfield students, and the Gardendale superintendent’s decision to\n\nattend Gardendale community events even though he refused an invitation to meet\n\nwith the parents of North Smithfield students. In other words, as the Supreme\n\nCourt did in Wright, the district court found that the secession movement\n\ncommunicated a “message” that “cannot have escaped the [black] children in the\n\n[C]ounty.” 407 U.S. at 466.\n\n      True, the factual context in Wright was different. There, a predominantly\n\nwhite splinter district sought to secede immediately after a desegregation order\n\nissued. Id. at 465–66. But the Supreme Court did not limit its reasoning to\n\nmessages of inferiority that result from the timing of a secession attempt. District\n\ncourts may consider the message communicated for any number of reasons if a\n\nsecession attempt “generates a feeling of inferiority” in black students that is akin\n\nto the message condemned in Brown I. Id. at 466 (quoting Brown I, 347 U.S. at\n\n494). Here, the timing of the message was different, but the message was the same.\n\n      The argument of the Gardendale Board that “[t]here is no Equal Protection\n\nright to be shielded from offensive messages” is wholly beside the point. Neither\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\f               Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 51 of 61\n\n\nthe district court nor the plaintiffs ever suggested that the secession effort violated\n\nsuch a right. The district court reasoned that the official acts of the Gardendale\n\nBoard and other Gardendale officials, when considered in the light of the history of\n\nthe secession movement, communicated a message that was intolerable under\n\nWright.\n\n      The district court did not clearly err. Its “account of the evidence is plausible\n\nin light of the record viewed in its entirety.” Holton, 425 F.3d at 1351. Indeed, the\n\nrecord amply supports its finding that the secession would impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board. And “we cannot overturn the\n\ndistrict court’s finding of fact simply because [other] evidence [i]s merely\n\nconflicting.” Id. at 1354 (alteration adopted) (quoting Ga. State Conference of\n\nBranches of NAACP, 775 F.2d at 1419).\n\n          C. The District Court Abused Its Discretion By Permitting a Partial\n                                       Secession.\n\n      Although the district court did not clearly err when it made its factual\n\nfindings, we agree with the plaintiffs and the Jefferson County Board that it abused\n\nits discretion when it modified the desegregation order. By sua sponte amending\n\nthe 1971 order to permit the partial secession of Gardendale, the district court\n\nmisapplied the law governing both splinter districts and race discrimination. And it\n\ndevised a novel remedy by weighing legally irrelevant—and sometimes legally\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 52 of 61\n\n\nprohibited—factors. Both of the factual findings made by the district court permit\n\nonly one ruling: denial of the motion to secede.\n\n      The district court erred when it ruled that a partial secession could be\n\npermitted even though the Gardendale Board had not proved a “lack of deleterious\n\neffects on desegregation.” Ross II, 583 F.2d at 714. Because the Gardendale Board\n\nwas the moving party, it bore the burden of proof. Our precedents make clear that a\n\nsplinter district must propose and defend a secession plan that will not impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the school district subject to an ongoing desegregation\n\norder. When the splinter district fails to satisfy that burden, “the district court may\n\nnot . . . recognize [its] creation,” Stout I, 448 F.2d at 404 (citation omitted). For\n\nexample, in Ross II, we declared that “[t]he division of a school district operating\n\nunder a desegregation order can be permitted only if the formation of the new\n\ndistrict will not impede the dismantling of the dual school system in the old\n\ndistrict,” and “[i]n such a situation, the proponents of the new district must bear a\n\nheavy burden to show the lack of deleterious effects on desegregation.” 583 F.2d at\n\n714. Similarly, in Ross I, we explained that the burden to show that the\n\n“implementation and operation” of a splinter district “meet[s] the tests outlined for\n\npermitting newly created districts to come into being” remains at all times with the\n\nsplinter district. 559 F.2d at 945. To satisfy that burden, the splinter district “must\n\nexpress its precise policy positions on each significant facet of school district\n\n\n\n                                           52\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 53 of 61\n\n\noperation.” Id. at 944. When the Gardendale Board failed to satisfy its burden, the\n\ndistrict court should have denied the motion before it.\n\n      Although the district court acknowledged that at least one precedent, Stout I,\n\nrequired it to prohibit the secession, it erroneously concluded that the Supreme\n\nCourt overruled that precedent in Wright and granted district courts greater\n\ndiscretion over whether to permit a splinter district. The district court read the\n\nstatement in Wright, 407 U.S. at 460, that “[i]f [a secession] proposal would\n\nimpede the dismantling of [a] dual system, then a district court, in the exercise of\n\nits remedial discretion, may enjoin it from being carried out” as granting a district\n\ncourt more flexibility. But Wright never suggested that a district court could\n\nfashion a more limited secession plan of its own making when it finds that a\n\nproposed plan would impede desegregation. Wright instead “h[e]ld only that a new\n\nschool district may not be created where its effect would be to impede the process\n\nof dismantling a dual system.” Id. at 470.\n\n      The district court also erred when it ruled that it was not bound to follow\n\nStout I under the law-of-the-case doctrine, which provides that earlier decisions\n\n“bind[] all subsequent proceedings in the same case” as to “both findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law.” United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 662, 668 (11th Cir.\n\n2014) (alteration adopted and citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\ndistrict court stated that “the facts of this case have changed” and that “it would\n\n\n\n                                          53\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 54 of 61\n\n\nwork a manifest injustice for th[e] [district] [c]ourt not to take the lack of activity\n\nin the case into account.” Although there are “limited exceptions to the law-of-the-\n\ncase doctrine [for situations in which] ‘there is new evidence, an intervening\n\nchange in controlling law dictates a different result, or the appellate decision, if\n\nimplemented, would cause manifest injustice because it is clearly erroneous,’” id.\n\nat 668–69 (quoting Litman v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 825 F.2d 1506, 1510 (11th\n\nCir. 1987) (en banc) (alteration adopted)), none of those exceptions apply here.\n\nStout I remains good law. That precedent still governs proposed secessions of\n\nmunicipal school systems. And the district court provided no explanation for why\n\nits application would work a manifest injustice in this case.\n\n      We and the district court are bound by every other splinter-district decision\n\nof the Supreme Court and this Court, including Wright, Ross I, and Ross II. See,\n\ne.g., Main Drug, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 475 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th\n\nCir. 2007) (“[W]ithout a clearly contrary opinion of the Supreme Court or of this\n\ncourt sitting en banc, we cannot overrule a decision of a prior panel of this court.”\n\n(quoting NLRB v. Datapoint Corp., 642 F.2d 123, 129 (5th Cir. Apr. 1981))). The\n\nage of these decisions does not diminish their precedential effect. If anything, their\n\nage enhances that effect. See Bryan A. Garner et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent\n\n176 (2016) (“The fact that a case remains an accurate statement of the law through\n\nmany generations often shows that it should be afforded special respect . . . .”).\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 55 of 61\n\n\n      The finding that a racially discriminatory purpose motivated the Gardendale\n\nBoard also obliged the district court to deny the motion to secede. The Supreme\n\nCourt has explained that official actions motivated by a discriminatory purpose\n\n“ha[ve] no legitimacy at all under our Constitution.” City of Richmond v. United\n\nStates, 422 U.S. 358, 378 (1975); see also id. at 379 (“[A]cts generally lawful may\n\nbecome unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end . . . .” (quoting\n\nWestern Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, 247 U.S. 105, 114 (1918))). That is why the\n\nSupreme Court has repeatedly invalidated government actions that violate the\n\nEqual Protection Clause. See, e.g., Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 233\n\n(1985); Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. at 487; see also N.C. State Conference of\n\nNAACP v. McCrory, 831 F.3d 204, 239 (4th Cir. 2016) (collecting citations). To be\n\nsure, the Supreme Court has stated that district courts supervising school\n\ndesegregation cases have “broad” equitable authority to remedy the effects of past\n\nde jure segregation. Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 281 (1977); see also\n\nJenkins, 515 U.S. at 88. But in those cases, the courts were not faced with a motion\n\nto amend an extant desegregation order. The 1971 order issued to ensure that the\n\nJefferson County Board “eliminate[d] the vestiges of the unconstitutional de jure\n\nsystem” so that “the principal wrong of the de jure system, the injuries and stigma\n\ninflicted upon the race disfavored by the violation, is no longer present.” Holton,\n\n425 F.3d at 1337 (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 485). Faced with a motion to\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 56 of 61\n\n\namend that order by a school board motivated by invidious discrimination, the\n\ndistrict court was obliged to deny the motion.\n\n       The district court failed to abide by the mandate to “restore the victims of\n\ndiscriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of\n\nsuch conduct.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 88 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Here, the clear way to “restore,” “as nearly as possible,” “the victims of\n\n[the] discriminatory conduct” was to deny the motion to secede. Id. (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). If the motion were denied, black schoolchildren\n\nwho attend Gardendale schools would continue to benefit from the supervision of\n\nthe Jefferson County Board, which is governed by a federal order to desegregate its\n\nschools. When the district court rejected this option in favor of permitting a new\n\nboard created, in part, for the purpose of racial discrimination to control the\n\neducational policy of at least two schools, it abused its discretion. Its finding of a\n\nracially discriminatory purpose required the district court to deny the motion to\n\nsecede in its entirety.\n\n       Instead of denying the motion to secede, the district court—unprompted by\n\neither party—devised its own secession plan. In doing so, it weighed a number of\n\nimpermissible considerations and thereby abused its discretion.\n\n       The district court speculated that the 1971 order may soon be dissolved, and\n\nit drew a series of impermissible conclusions from that supposition. The district\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\f              Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 57 of 61\n\n\ncourt stated that if it permitted the secession, it would be “reluctant” to release\n\nJefferson County from the 1971 order because of the “evidence of racial\n\nmotivation in this case.” In its later supplemental opinion, it appeared to be less\n\nconcerned that Jefferson County might fail to obtain a unitary-status determination\n\nthan that it would succeed. According to the district court, if Jefferson County were\n\nto succeed, the residents of Gardendale could again attempt to secede and, in that\n\nscenario, “there would be no federal desegregation order to protect zoning,\n\ninterdistrict transfers, and the Gardendale high school facility.” So it decided “to\n\nplace the Gardendale Board under a new desegregation order that creates a fresh\n\nstart for federal supervision of all aspects of the public schools in Gardendale.” It\n\nadded that the new order was appropriate because the plaintiffs may not be able to\n\nprove racially discriminatory purpose in the future and, without a constitutional\n\nviolation, it would be unable to protect the plaintiffs. It stated that it is “not a safe\n\nassumption” that “in a few years, the situation in Gardendale will be identical to\n\nthe set of circumstances that produced the [district] [c]ourt’s finding that the\n\nGardendale Board violated the Fourteenth Amendment.” And it explained that it\n\nhad to “weigh the possibility that the plaintiff class would not succeed” in proving\n\nracially discriminatory purpose.\n\n       Multiple errors plague this reasoning. As a threshold matter, the district\n\ncourt had no basis to speculate about the possibility that Jefferson County might or\n\n\n\n                                            57\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 58 of 61\n\n\nmight not obtain a determination of unitary status. The district court acknowledged\n\nthat it “[did] not have before it information that [would] allow[] it to determine just\n\nhow close Jefferson County may be to the end of supervision.”\n\n      The district court was faced with a motion to amend the 1971 order and\n\nerred when it described its order as imposing a “new desegregation order.” When a\n\nsplinter district moves to secede from a school district governed by a desegregation\n\norder, the movant seeks to modify that order. So when the district court permitted\n\nthe Gardendale Board to operate a new school system, it modified the 1971 order.\n\nIf the district court had imposed an entirely new desegregation order, that order\n\nwould have been unlawful. A new desegregation order may not be imposed to\n\nguard against the possibility that a constitutional violation will either soon be\n\nremedied or no longer exist. A desegregation order must instead remedy state-\n\nsanctioned segregation that has already been adjudicated. See, e.g., Jenkins, 515\n\nU.S. at 88 (“[F]ederal-court decrees must directly address and relate to the\n\nconstitutional violation itself.” (quoting Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282)). Although a\n\nracially discriminatory purpose motivated it to secede, the Gardendale Board had\n\nnot implemented its plan so as to require a judicial remedy to unravel it. In other\n\nwords, the Gardendale Board only proposed to violate the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nand the district court was obliged to reject that proposal.\n\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 59 of 61\n\n\n       The district court also erred when it speculated that the possible social\n\ntension caused by finding a constitutional violation would warrant allowing the\n\nviolation to succeed in part. The district court stated that it had to consider the\n\ninterests of students from North Smithfield who “may feel unwelcome in\n\nGardendale schools” if it denied the motion to secede. But even if the plaintiffs had\n\nsuggested—contrary to their litigating position—that such a concern was plausible,\n\nthe history of school desegregation is rife with conflict. Indeed, if animosity alone\n\ncould thwart constitutional imperatives, Brown II would have been in error. As the\n\nSupreme Court put it then, “the vitality of . . . constitutional principles cannot be\n\nallowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.” Brown II, 349 U.S. at\n\n300.\n\n       And the district court erred when it suggested that the benign motivations of\n\nsome Gardendale residents could cure the discriminatory motivation of the\n\nGardendale Board. The district court stated that it “must, to the extent practicable,\n\nhonor the wishes of parents who support a local system simply because they want\n\ngreater control over their children’s education.” But even if the parents the district\n\ncourt identified were state actors relevant to the constitutional analysis, Wright\n\nmade clear that when a locality attempts to secede from a school district subject to\n\nan ongoing desegregation order, “[t]he existence of a permissible purpose cannot\n\nsustain an action that has an impermissible effect.” 407 U.S. at 462. Even more\n\n\n\n                                           59\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 60 of 61\n\n\nconcerning, the district court gave special weight to the concerns of some\n\nGardendale parents because of their race, which should be—and is—legally\n\nirrelevant.\n\n      At oral argument, the plaintiffs’ counsel represented that they and the\n\nJefferson County Board expect later this year to present the district court a plan for\n\nthe final resolution of this litigation, which has lasted more than a half century. We\n\nencourage that effort to bring this remedial phase to an end. In the meantime, both\n\nWright and our precedents about splinter districts still govern the Gardendale\n\nBoard.\n\n         Of course, we do not suggest that the Gardendale Board of Education is\n\n“forever [a] vassal[] of the [C]ounty [B]oard.” Stout II, 466 F.2d at 1215. The\n\nauthority of the judiciary to intervene in the “local autonomy” of Jefferson County,\n\nJenkins, 515 U.S. at 99, is tied to the constitutional violation at issue: the earlier de\n\njure segregation of schools. If the Gardendale Board, for permissible purposes in\n\nthe future, satisfies its burden to develop a secession plan that will not impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board, then the district court may not\n\nprohibit the secession. We do not belittle the “need that is strongly felt in our\n\nsociety” to have “[d]irect control over decisions vitally affecting the education of\n\none’s children.” Wright, 407 U.S. at 469. Indeed, the “local autonomy of school\n\ndistricts is a vital national tradition.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 99. We hold only that the\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 61 of 61\n\n\ndesire for local autonomy must yield when a constitutional violation is found and\n\nremains unremedied.\n\n                               IV.

A racial desegregation order issued in 1971 still governs the\n\nJefferson County Board of Education in Alabama. But beginning in 2012, residents\n\nof the City of Gardendale, a predominantly white community in Jefferson County,\n\nsought to create a separate, municipal school system. Leaders of a grassroots\n\nmovement used social media to discuss the changing racial demographics of their\n\nschools as they campaigned for the creation of a city school board and new taxes to\n\nsupport the proposed school system. In 2015, the newly created Gardendale City\n\nBoard of Education moved the district court to permit it to operate a municipal\n\nschool system, but black schoolchildren opposed the motion. The district court\n\nfound that the Gardendale Board acted with a discriminatory purpose to exclude\n\nblack children from the proposed school system and, alternatively, that the\n\nsecession of the Gardendale Board would impede the efforts of the Jefferson\n\n*\n  Honorable Raymond C. Clevenger III, United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 3 of 61\n\n\nCounty Board to fulfill its desegregation obligations. Despite these findings, the\n\ndistrict court devised and permitted a partial secession that neither party requested.\n\nWe conclude that the district court committed no clear error in its findings of a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose and of impeding the desegregation of the Jefferson County\n\nschools, but that it abused its discretion when it sua sponte allowed a partial\n\nsecession. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions to deny\n\nthe motion to secede.\n\n                                 I.

The order included a provision that\n\npermits some students to transfer from schools in which their race is in the\n\nmajority to schools in which their race is in the minority. And it provided that\n\nJefferson County must pay municipal school systems that educate students from\n\nunincorporated areas of the County the ad valorem school taxes collected from\n\nthose areas.

The circuit court affirmed a refusal to\n\nrequire busing between two predominantly white and black school zones as\n\ndangerous and infeasible. Id. And it stated that “the former dual school system has\n\nbeen effectively dismantled and a unitary system substituted.” Id. at 802. Even so,\n\nit determined that the school system still “must continue under the scrutiny and\n\nsurveillance of the district court,” and it directed that the district court consider\n\n“broadening and making more attractive its existing majority-to-minority transfer\n\nprocedures and . . . strengthening the curriculum to magnet levels in [two]\n\nfacilities.” Id. at 803.\n\n       Predominantly white municipalities continued to secede and slowly, but\n\nsignificantly, change the demographic makeup of the Jefferson County schools.\n\nSince the dissolution of the Pleasant Grove school system, three other\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 8 of 61\n\n\npredominantly white municipalities—Hoover, Trussville, and Leeds—seceded\n\nfrom the Jefferson County school system. And some municipalities later annexed\n\npredominantly white communities in the County. In 2003, for example, the City of\n\nVestavia Hills annexed the Cahaba Heights community, the population of which\n\nwas about 95 percent white as of 2010. And the secession of Trussville and Leeds\n\nalone led to about a 3 percentage point decrease in the white population and a 3\n\npercentage point increase in the black population in the Jefferson County school\n\nsystem.\n\n      The cumulative impact of these municipal secessions and suburban growth\n\nhas been dramatic. In 2000, the student population in the Jefferson County school\n\nsystem was about 75 percent white and 23 percent black. But by 2015, the student\n\npopulation of the school system was approximately 43 percent white and 47\n\npercent black.\n\n             B. The Evolution of the Gardendale Secession Movement\n      The Gardendale secession movement started when the schools in that City\n\nwere becoming racially diverse while the population of the City remained\n\noverwhelmingly white. In 1996, the student population in Gardendale was 92\n\npercent white and 8 percent black. The current population of the City has a similar\n\ndemographic makeup. As of 2010, more than 88 percent of the population was\n\nwhite and less than 9 percent was black. But by 2010, only one of the four public\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 9 of 61\n\n\nschools in Gardendale, Snow Rogers Elementary School, came close to mirroring\n\nthe racial demographics of the City. In 2010, Snow Rogers Elementary was about\n\n94 percent white and 4 percent black. The other three schools in Gardendale—\n\nGardendale Elementary, Bragg Middle School, and Gardendale High School—\n\nwere less than 80 percent white and 20 or more percent black. Gardendale\n\nElementary was about 75 percent white and 20 percent black; Bragg Middle was\n\nabout 77 percent white and 21 percent black; and Gardendale High was about 75\n\npercent white and 23 percent black. And in later years, the schools continued to\n\nbecome more racially diverse in even starker contrast with the demographics of the\n\nCity. Snow Rogers Elementary had a student population that was about 85 percent\n\nwhite and 5 percent black during the 2015–16 academic year. Gardendale\n\nElementary was about 71 percent white and 24 percent black. Bragg Middle was\n\nabout 67 percent white and 29 percent black. And Gardendale High was about 71\n\npercent white and 27 percent black.\n\n      The racial diversity of the schools in Gardendale stems from the attendance\n\nof students who reside outside its municipal limits. Students from the\n\npredominantly black community of North Smithfield/Greenleaf Heights constitute\n\nnearly 30 percent of the black student population at Bragg Middle and more than\n\n25 percent of the black student population at Gardendale High. Students from the\n\nunincorporated and predominantly white community of Mount Olive as well as\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f             Case: 17-12338       Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 10 of 61\n\n\nstudents from the more integrated Town of Brookside and City of Graysville also\n\nattend the middle and high schools in Gardendale. Dozens of black students have\n\ntaken advantage of the majority-to-minority transfer provision in the 1971 order to\n\nattend schools in Gardendale. For example, from 2009 to 2016, anywhere from 12\n\nto 22 black students attended Gardendale High annually as transfer students. After\n\nthe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq., required public\n\nschool boards to permit students attending schools “identified for school\n\nimprovement” to transfer to schools not so identified, 20 U.S.C. § 6316 (repealed\n\n2015), the district court also amended the 1971 order to permit some black students\n\nfrom less successful schools to transfer to Snow Rogers Elementary and Bragg\n\nMiddle. Because of capacity issues, the district court permitted only 12 students to\n\ntransfer to Bragg Middle for each of the relevant years. In sum, Gardendale schools\n\nare racially diverse institutions in an otherwise white enclave in large part because\n\nzoning and desegregation transfer opportunities permit other Jefferson County\n\nstudents to attend the schools.\n\n      Against this backdrop, four individuals, Tim Bagwell, Chris Lucas, David\n\nSalters, and Chris Segroves, launched a campaign to create a municipal school\n\nsystem for Gardendale. Segroves later became the president of the Gardendale\n\nBoard. Lucas became a member of the Board. And Bagwell and Salters served on\n\nan advisory board.\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 11 of 61\n\n\n      As part of their campaign, Bagwell, Lucas, and Salters created and\n\nmaintained a Facebook page titled “Gardendale City Schools.” The page was\n\npublicly accessible, but the secession leaders served as page administrators with\n\nthe ability to approve new members, delete posts, and change the privacy settings.\n\n      From the start, the secession leaders expressed concern about the changing\n\ndemographics of the Gardendale schools. Salters explained in one post that the\n\npopulation of the predominantly white City of Gardendale looked different from\n\nthe more diverse student population at the Gardendale schools: “A look around at\n\nour community sporting events, our churches are great snapshots of our\n\ncommunity. A look into our schools, and you’ll see something totally different.”\n\nBagwell alluded to those demographic differences when he listed among the\n\nbenefits of a municipal system, “better control over the geographic composition of\n\nthe student body [and] protection against the actions of other jurisdictions that\n\nmight not be in our best interests.”\n\n      The secession leaders argued that a separate school system would give the\n\nresidents of Gardendale greater control over their children’s education, improve the\n\nacademic quality of the schools, and permit Gardendale “to control [its] own\n\nrevenue stream.” But the secession leaders never met with representatives of the\n\nJefferson County Board to discuss their grievances, and they struggled to identify\n\nspecific deficiencies in the County schools. Segroves testified that he “had no\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 12 of 61\n\n\ninvolvement in the schools in Jefferson County prior to . . . serving on the\n\n[Gardendale] [B]oard.” When asked to identify “specific changes that [he] would\n\nmake if [Gardendale] were allowed to separate,” Salters replied, “Just overall\n\nimprovements, general improvements of education which are reflected in the size\n\nof the school system.” And Bagwell stated that “at least historically in many areas,\n\nincluding Alabama, a smaller system with individual local control, historically they\n\ntend to perform better academically than larger systems.” He added that a\n\nmunicipal school system “seems to be a component for a vital community with\n\nhigher-than-average growth and desirability.”\n\n      The secession leaders and others frequently blamed “non-residents,”\n\nparticularly students from the predominantly black community of North\n\nSmithfield, for allegedly draining resources from the Gardendale schools. In\n\nresponse to a suggestion that racial concerns were animating the movement, Salters\n\nstated in a Facebook post that “non-resident students are increasing at a [sic]\n\nalarming rate in our schools.” “They consume the resources of our schools, our\n\nteachers and our resident students, then go home” without “contribut[ing]\n\nfinancially.” He stated that he would “welcome those students,” but only if they\n\n“move to Gardendale or pay a transfer fee.” One online participant put it more\n\nbluntly: “[D]id you know we are sending school buses to Center point [sic] and\n\nbusing kids to OUR schools in Gardendale, as well as from Smithville!” That\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 13 of 61\n\n\nparticipant stated that some of the transfer students “have been bused here for years\n\ndue to the desegregation from decades ago and that should have already been\n\nchanged because we have a very diverse population now in our area.” The\n\nparticipant said, “We are busting at the seams and can’t continue on this path!”\n\nSalters expressed similar concerns: “We are using buses to transport non-residents\n\ninto our schools (without additional funding) from as far away as Center Point\n\n(there’s your redistribution of wealth).”\n\n      Secession supporters frequently derided the City of Center Point, a\n\npredominantly black community that used to be a predominantly white community\n\nand has no municipal school system. In 1970, Center Point was over 99 percent\n\nwhite, but by 2010, about 33 percent of Center Point was white and 63 percent was\n\nblack. When comparing Gardendale to Center Point, secession leaders warned\n\nresidents that if they failed to act, Gardendale would follow a similar trajectory.\n\nFor example, at a public meeting, Salters stated, “It likely will not turn out well for\n\nGardendale if we don’t do this. We don’t want to become what” Center Point has\n\nbecome. And an online participant asked, “[W]ould you like to live in Center Point\n\nor Adamsville?” She “encourage[d] [another online participant] to ride around\n\nthose areas, maybe even Pinson or Huffman and think about how quickly an area’s\n\ndemographics change.” She added, “This is about a community wanting to\n\nprogress, not regress.”\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 14 of 61\n\n\n      In contrast with their comments about Center Point, the secession leaders\n\ntouted the predominantly white community of Mount Olive as a desirable area to\n\nbe included in the new school system. In a post on Facebook, Lucas contrasted the\n\nintended treatment of Mount Olive with that of “minorities.” In response to a\n\nquestion about the impact of “[f]ederal desegregation laws” on the proposed\n\nsecession, he explained that minorities not residing in Gardendale would not be\n\nstudents in the new system, but that Gardendale might annex Mount Olive:\n\n      1) Will kids in North Gardendale (who may currently be zoned for\n      county schools in Morris) be zoned for a city school system? Yes. All\n      kids within the municipal boundaries of Gardendale would go to\n      schools within the new system.\n\n      2) Would Gardendale be required to bring in minorities from outside\n      of the municipal boundaries to achieve some sort of quota? No. The\n      school system is for residents of Gardendale (whatever those\n      boundaries end up being and whatever that racial make-up is). The\n      idea is that it might include an expansion to include an annexation of\n      certain parts of Mount Olive.\nIndeed, the secession leaders and others regularly discussed the status of Mount\n\nOlive, though practical obstacles related to the local fire district ultimately\n\nthwarted their intended plans.\n\n      Eventually, the secession leaders “began having conversations with the\n\nmayor . . . and the council . . ., and [they] got their backing because any kind of\n\nofficial actions would obviously have to occur through the city, and then the city\n\ncommission.” Lucas explained that “[a]t the end of the day, [city officials have] got\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 15 of 61\n\n\nto drive the official efforts, but it really became a ground swell of a movement and\n\nthat was how the whole idea was born.” According to Lucas, he and Salters “put\n\nthe mayor and the council in a head lock until they came to their own conclusions\n\nthat the school system had to happen.”\n\n      In October 2012, the Gardendale City Council commissioned Dr. Ira Harvey\n\nto study the feasibility of a Gardendale school system. Harvey concluded that the\n\nsecession was possible based on estimates that included students from\n\npredominantly white Mount Olive but did not include students from predominantly\n\nblack North Smithfield. Harvey’s conclusion stemmed, in large part, from his\n\ndetermination that the municipal school system would acquire debt-free the $51\n\nmillion Gardendale high-school facility, which though located in the City of\n\nGardendale was financed and constructed by Jefferson County. The siting of the\n\nschool was proposed by the Jefferson County Board to the plaintiffs and the United\n\nStates, and the parties agreed that the high school would serve as a regional\n\neducational facility with a career technical program to foster voluntary\n\ndesegregation by encouraging high-school students to enroll in programs outside of\n\ntheir zoned schools. According to the Jefferson County superintendent, Dr. Warren\n\nPouncey, the high school currently serves students who reside in about five\n\ndifferent high school zones.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 16 of 61\n\n\n      While Harvey was performing the feasibility study, the secession leaders\n\nformed a nonprofit entity called Future of Our Community Utilizing Schools\n\n(FOCUS) Gardendale. FOCUS Gardendale existed to raise funds and to lobby for\n\nhigher property taxes to support the proposed school system. FOCUS Gardendale\n\ncirculated a flyer that depicted a white elementary-school student and asked,\n\n“Which path will Gardendale choose?” It then listed several well-integrated or\n\npredominantly black cities that had not formed municipal systems followed by a\n\nlist of predominantly white cities that had. The flyer described the predominantly\n\nwhite communities as “some of the best places to live in the country.”\n\n\n\n\n      The campaign by the secession leaders succeeded. In September 2013, the\n\nCity Council approved a five-mill ad valorem tax, and the citizens of Gardendale\n\n                                         16\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 17 of 61\n\n\nlater voted on a referendum to impose an additional five-mill tax to fund the school\n\nsystem. In 2014, the Council adopted an ordinance that “established a public\n\nschool system for the City of Gardendale, Alabama, to be known as the Gardendale\n\nCity School System.” Gardendale, Ala., Code § 14-1 (2014). The ordinance also\n\ncreated a Board of Education and vested it with the “power, authority and dut[y]”\n\nto, among other things, “maintain and do all things necessary and proper for the\n\nmanagement of the Gardendale City School System.” Id. § 14-4. That same year,\n\nthe Council appointed the first members of the Gardendale Board, which, under\n\nstate law, could include only Gardendale residents. See Ala. Code § 16-11-2(b).\n\nAlthough the Council received applications from black residents of Gardendale,\n\nthe five members selected were all white.\n\n      The Gardendale Board immediately hired Dr. Patrick Martin to serve as\n\nsuperintendent. Martin had no prior experience operating under a desegregation\n\norder, none of the school districts where he has previously worked was more than\n\n15 percent black, and over his 17-year career as an administrator and educator, he\n\nhas never hired a black teacher, worked with a black teacher, or hired a black\n\nadministrator. When he sent the Gardendale Board an email update to help it\n\n“understand the lens through which the Plaintiff Parties may view [the]\n\n[s]eparation,” he quoted a book he was reading that compared the income\n\ndistribution of black people in 1970 and today. He stated that about the same\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 18 of 61\n\n\npercentage of black people live in poverty today and that, according to the book,\n\n“[m]uch of the progress that was the source of such optimism a generation ago has\n\nbeen lost in the current generation.”\n\n      Superintendent Martin drafted a secession plan in the fall of 2014. An early\n\nplan provided that all of the non-resident students who currently attend the four\n\nschools in Gardendale, including students from North Smithfield and other\n\nsurrounding areas, would be phased out of the Gardendale municipal system over a\n\nperiod of 13 years. Superintendent Martin’s plan permitted racial desegregation\n\ntransfer students to attend the Gardendale schools, but it conditioned transfer\n\nopportunities on space availability, tuition payments by means other than personal\n\ncheck, annual reapplications for transfer, and a stipulation that the Gardendale\n\nBoard would not provide transportation to transfer students. Afterward, Segroves,\n\nas president of the Gardendale Board, questioned the need for racial desegregation\n\ntransfers. On a redline version of the plan, he wrote, “Legal team to review and\n\nconfirm its applicability/appropriateness for GBOE [Gardendale Board of\n\nEducation]” next to the racial desegregation provision.\n\n      Although the Gardendale Board never formally approved any plan, it\n\nsubmitted a plan to the district court in December 2015 in support of its motion to\n\nsecede. Like the earlier one, the plan submitted to the district court proposed\n\nredrawing the school attendance lines at the municipal boundaries of Gardendale\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 19 of 61\n\n\nand eliminating, over the course of a 13-year transition period, many of the non-\n\nresident students from the Gardendale schools. But the plan eliminated entirely the\n\nracial desegregation transfer provision.\n\n      The plan provided that North Smithfield students in kindergarten through\n\ntwelfth grade “shall attend the Gardendale Schools on the same basis as\n\nGardendale Students, provided that the County Board or the tax collector for\n\nJefferson County shall pay to the City Board the ad valorem school taxes collected\n\nfrom the North Smithfield Manor and Greenleaf Heights communities.” The plan\n\nprovided no transition period for these students. The Gardendale Board vaguely\n\nalleged in its motion to secede that “North Smithfield Manor and Greenleaf\n\nHeights students will be able to attend Gardendale Schools for the indefinite\n\nfuture.” But the Gardendale Board did not consult with the parents of North\n\nSmithfield students before adding this provision. In fact, Superintendent Martin\n\ndeclined an invitation to attend North Smithfield Community Civic League\n\nmeetings to discuss the proposed secession. And although Martin testified that he\n\nadded the provision, in part, because of “the importance of educational continuity,”\n\nhe also testified that the change was motivated by a desire to “honor the\n\n[desegregation] order.”\n\n      Some supporters of secession expressed their displeasure at the prospect of\n\nallowing any non-residents to attend the municipal schools. Bagwell defended on\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 20 of 61\n\n\nFacebook permitting the attendance of North Smithfield students as “a specific,\n\ntechnical, tactical decision aimed at addressing a recognized road block to breaking\n\naway.” And he later described that “bitter . . . pill” as something that weighed\n\nagainst the “ultimate . . . goal” of secession:\n\n      You and I may not think that it is particularly fair to accept an out-of-\n      district area not subject to our control or taxation as a price to pay to\n      gain approval for separation, and we would be within reason to feel\n      that way. The extent to which fair has anything to do with it depends\n      on how you weigh your priorities in deciding whether it is too bitter a\n      pill to swallow or if the ultimate treatment goal, i.e. separation, is\n      worth it.\n                      C. The Proceedings in the District Court\n      On March 13, 2015, the Gardendale Board moved to intervene in this action.\n\nAlthough counsel for the Gardendale Board represented that he understood that\n\n“every aspect of [the] operation [of the proposed school system] would have to be\n\nsubmitted to the [district] [c]ourt for review,” the Gardendale Board also filed a\n\ncomplaint in state court requesting that the state court direct the Jefferson County\n\nBoard to relinquish control of the Gardendale schools. The district court later\n\nenjoined the state lawsuit. On December 11, 2015, the Gardendale Board filed a\n\nmotion to operate a municipal school system and attached the 2015 proposed\n\nsecession plan. Black children who currently attend Jefferson County schools were\n\nsubstituted as plaintiffs in the action and opposed the secession. And the City of\n\nGraysville, the Town of Brookside, and two parents from Mount Olive moved for\n\nlimited intervention to oppose the secession.\n\n                                           20\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 21 of 61\n\n\n      The Gardendale Board sought immediate review of its motion to secede\n\neven though the district court was in the process of determining whether judicial\n\nsupervision of Jefferson County continued to be necessary. Counsel for Gardendale\n\nstated, “[I]t is [not] necessary for the [district] [c]ourt to decide whether or not the\n\ncounty has, in fact, achieved full unitary status for the [district] [c]ourt to be able to\n\nrule on [the] motion to be allowed to separate.” And about a year later,\n\nSuperintendent Martin joined representatives of the Department of Justice and\n\nothers for a tour of the schools in the Jefferson County system. After the site visit,\n\nMartin opined in a “Weekly Board Update” to members of the Gardendale Board\n\nthat “if Jefferson County really does aim to gain Unitary Status there is going to be\n\nan excessive amount of work to be done across the entirety of the county and . . .\n\nwe need to do everything to make sure we are not lumped into that process.”\n\n      When the district court ruled on the motion by the Gardendale Board to\n\noperate a municipal school system, the district court made two findings of fact.\n\nFirst, it found that the Gardendale Board violated the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment because “race was a motivating factor in Gardendale’s\n\ndecision to separate from the Jefferson County public school system.” Second, it\n\nfound that “Gardendale ha[d] not established that its separation will not impede\n\nJefferson County’s effort to obtain a court order dissolving the . . . desegregation\n\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 22 of 61\n\n\norder.” But the district court then sua sponte invoked its equitable authority to craft\n\na new secession plan based on “a number of practical considerations.”\n\n      The district court found that the supporters of secession from the outset\n\nacted with a racially discriminatory purpose. It found that “some Gardendale\n\ncitizens are concerned because the racial demographics in Gardendale are shifting,\n\nand they worry that Gardendale, like its neighbor Center Point, may become a\n\npredominantly black city.” The district court found that they “prefer a\n\npredominantly white city” and support a municipal school system because it would\n\nallow them to eliminate non-resident black students from the Gardendale schools.\n\nThe district court found that concerns about the “geographic composition” of the\n\nstudent bodies in the Gardendale schools could be traced to the 1971 desegregation\n\norder, which created a Gardendale attendance zone that includes North Smithfield\n\nand provides for desegregation transfer opportunities. The district court found that\n\nthe secession leaders preferred that the Gardendale schools serve only the\n\npredominantly white students that reside in Gardendale and Mount Olive. The\n\ndistrict court also explained that although at least one Facebook comment\n\nostensibly blamed the No Child Left Behind Act for capacity and other issues at\n\nthe Gardendale schools, most of the transfer students attending the Gardendale\n\nschools were desegregation transfer students. So the children “who look ‘totally\n\ndifferent’ from the children who attend churches in Gardendale or play on ball\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f              Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 23 of 61\n\n\nfields there are students from the North Smithfield community . . . and transfer\n\nstudents from areas like Center Point who attend Gardendale schools pursuant to\n\nthe . . . desegregation order.”\n\n      The district court found that the secession leaders recognized that if they\n\nwanted to “maintain the geographic integrity of the Gardendale zone,” they had to\n\n“translate their grassroots effort into official action.” Different versions of the\n\nsecession plan imposed conditions that the district court “reasonably infer[red]”\n\nwere “designed to minimize or eliminate racial desegregation transfers.” The plan\n\nattached to the motion to secede would have eliminated all racial desegregation\n\ntransfer students. Earlier drafts conditioned transfer opportunities on space\n\navailability, which would effectively eliminate Gardendale Elementary and Bragg\n\nMiddle as potential transferee schools. And the last plan submitted to the district\n\ncourt provided that transfer opportunities would be provided “subject to space\n\navailability” and that transportation would not be provided “unless required by\n\nfederal courts.”\n\n      The district court explained that none of these plans had been approved by\n\nthe Gardendale Board and that Superintendent Martin was “unable to say which, if\n\nany, of his draft transfer policies the Gardendale Board ultimately would be willing\n\nto implement.” The district court found that “[t]his official action—or lack\n\nthereof—dovetails with the separation organizers’ expressed interest in eliminating\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 24 of 61\n\n\nfrom the [Gardendale] schools . . . students who are bussed into Gardendale from\n\nother areas of Jefferson County.”\n\n      The district court found that the treatment of the North Smithfield students\n\nin the various draft plans suggested that the Gardendale Board would permit those\n\nstudents to attend Gardendale schools only if required by a federal-court order.\n\nEven though North Smithfield students have attended the Gardendale schools since\n\n1971, the Gardendale Board sought to exclude them entirely in an early draft of the\n\nsecession plan. The Gardendale Board “recalculated after it realized that the\n\nelimination of the North Smithfield students might jeopardize the separation\n\neffort.” And comments referring to the change in the December 2015 plan as a\n\n“specific, technical, tactical decision aimed at addressing a recognized road block\n\nto breaking away” confirmed the motivation behind that decision.\n\n      The district court also found that the Gardendale Board had not voted on a\n\nplan because it “ha[d] been waiting to see whether its attorneys could persuade the\n\n[district] [c]ourt that the 1971 desegregation order does not govern Gardendale’s\n\nseparation.” If the district court ruled that the order no longer governs municipal\n\nsecessions, then the Gardendale Board would not need to ensure any racial\n\ndiversity in its schools. And even if the district court ruled that the order still\n\ngoverns secessions, the Gardendale Board would condition the attendance of North\n\nSmithfield students on the remittance of ad valorem tax dollars from Jefferson\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 25 of 61\n\n\nCounty because the desegregation order provides the “mechanism that makes those\n\ntax dollars flow to Gardendale.” So if the desegregation order were dissolved in the\n\nfuture, the North Smithfield students “would have no assurance that [the\n\nGardendale Board] would allow them to continue to attend Gardendale schools.”\n\nIn other words, even though the secession leaders originally planned to permit\n\nstudents from Mount Olive, a predominantly white community, to attend the\n\nGardendale schools, the Gardendale Board refused to “ma[k]e a meaningful,\n\nbinding commitment to the children in North Smithfield.” The district court found\n\nthat “the Gardendale Board is trying to evade the [district] [c]ourt’s desegregation\n\norder because some citizens in Gardendale want to eliminate from Gardendale\n\nschools the black students whom Jefferson County transports to schools in\n\nGardendale.”\n\n      The district court rejected the argument of the Gardendale Board that our\n\npredecessor circuit ruled that Jefferson County had achieved unitary status in Stout\n\nIII. It explained that Stout III used the term “unitary” to describe student\n\nassignments in Jefferson County, not the status of its desegregation efforts. And it\n\nrejected the argument that “desegregation orders are outmoded” because “age\n\nalone does not render the [1971] order unenforceable.” It also explained that it\n\n“reasonably infer[red] from Gardendale’s litigation strategy and from the\n\nSuperintendent’s statement that Jefferson County has to do ‘an excessive amount\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 26 of 61\n\n\nof work’ to fulfill the obligations of the desegregation order that Gardendale does\n\nnot genuinely believe that Jefferson County currently is eligible for a release from\n\nfederal supervision.” But although the district court determined that the 1971 order\n\nwas still in effect, it ruled that the “one-third requirement” that prompted the\n\ninclusion of North Smithfield in the secession plan was unenforceable under\n\ncurrent law because it involved an unlawful racial quota.\n\n      The district court found that the secession of Gardendale would impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board in three ways. First, it\n\nconsidered the “post-separation racial demographics.” It acknowledged that “[b]y\n\nGardendale’s numbers, the municipal system will be more desegregated at the\n\nconclusion of the [transition] period” because the Gardendale Board will “phase\n\nout more white students than black students.” But it found that the transition period\n\n“makes the ultimate racial composition of the Gardendale district difficult to\n\nforecast because so much may change over 13 years.” The district court found that\n\na new school system would likely have a higher percentage of white students than\n\nthe statistics offered by the Gardendale Board suggest because predominantly\n\nwhite communities likely would be annexed by Gardendale. The district court also\n\nacknowledged that the impact on the Jefferson County school system “may seem\n\ninsignificant at first blush.” It found that if Gardendale seceded and the new school\n\nsystem included only Gardendale students, the overall student population in the\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 27 of 61\n\n\nJefferson County school system would become 1.8 percent more black. And if\n\nNorth Smithfield students were zoned for the Gardendale schools, the Jefferson\n\nCounty student population would become 1.5 percent more black. But it\n\nunderscored the “cumulative impact of municipal separations and annexations on\n\nJefferson County’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the desegregation order.”\n\nIt found that the “series of municipal separations in Jefferson County has\n\nrepeatedly shifted the geographic, demographic, and economic characteristics of\n\nthe Jefferson County district, making it difficult” for the Jefferson County Board to\n\ncomply with the desegregation order and for the district court to evaluate its\n\ncompliance. And it found that the “[t]he direct impact of the separation” would be\n\nto force displaced students to attend more segregated schools. The district court\n\nstressed that middle and high school students, in particular, would be forced to\n\nattend schools that are between 85 percent and 99 percent white or black.\n\n      Second, the district court underscored the importance of Gardendale High to\n\nthe desegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board, and it found that its loss\n\nwould cause the Jefferson County Board to have fewer funds to invest in other\n\nfacilities and programming. It explained that the Jefferson County Board invested\n\nin the magnet program in the high school and located it in Gardendale to encourage\n\nvoluntary desegregation and satisfy its obligations under the 1971 order. If the\n\nJefferson County Board were to forfeit the high school facility, it would lose the\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 28 of 61\n\n\nuse of this important “desegregatory tool[].” And the district court added that the\n\nother schools in Gardendale have also “played an important role in Jefferson\n\nCounty’s desegregation efforts” because their location makes it “relatively\n\nconvenient” for black students to take advantage of desegregation transfer\n\nopportunities. If desegregation transfer students could no longer attend those\n\nschools, black students might be less willing to transfer at all.\n\n      Third, the district court explained that the words and actions of the secession\n\nleaders and the Gardendale Board “communicated messages of inferiority and\n\nexclusion” to black schoolchildren. It quoted the “belittling language of exclusion”\n\non the public Facebook page. It described the FOCUS Gardendale flyer that\n\n“ask[ed] Gardendale voters if they would rather live in an affluent white city or a\n\nformerly white city that now is well-integrated or predominantly black.” And it\n\nexplained that the Gardendale Board not only failed to disavow those messages of\n\ninferiority but instead reinforced them. The Gardendale superintendent never\n\nconferred with the parents of North Smithfield students even though he was in\n\nregular communication with Gardendale residents; he ignored reports that\n\nGardendale residents were upset that North Smithfield students would be allowed\n\nto attend the Gardendale schools; and the Gardendale Board never voted on any\n\nplan that would give North Smithfield students some meaningful assurance that\n\nthey could continue to attend the Gardendale schools. The district court found that\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 29 of 61\n\n\n“[t]he messages of inferiority in the record in this case assail the dignity of black\n\nschool children.”\n\n      Despite finding that the Gardendale Board sought to secede for racially\n\ndiscriminatory reasons and that the secession would impede the desegregation\n\nefforts of the Jefferson County Board, the district court sua sponte devised and\n\npermitted a partial secession that effectively amended the 1971 desegregation\n\norder, and it listed four “practical considerations” to support its decision. First, it\n\nexplained that if it prohibited the secession, Gardendale families and students “may\n\nblame students from North Smithfield for Gardendale’s inability to operate a\n\nmunicipal system.” Second, it explained that it had to consider the interests of the\n\nstudents and parents in other parts of Jefferson County, and it stated that it “would\n\nbe reluctant to [release Jefferson County from federal supervision] if the\n\nGardendale zone remains in the Jefferson County district, given the evidence of\n\nracial motivation in this case.” In contrast, permitting the secession would allow\n\nthe district court to “tailor supervision to the particular needs of the county district\n\nand the municipal district.” Third, it stated that it “must, to the extent practicable,\n\nhonor the wishes of parents who support a local system simply because they want\n\ngreater control over their children’s education.” And fourth, it noted that it “may\n\nconsider the interests of” students from Mount Olive and the other communities\n\nthat would be directly affected by the secession.\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 30 of 61\n\n\n      The district court permitted the Gardendale Board to operate the two\n\nelementary schools in Gardendale and stated that the schools must be zoned for\n\nstudents residing within the Gardendale City limits. Elementary students from\n\nNorth Smithfield must be zoned for another Jefferson County elementary school.\n\nThe district court also directed counsel for all parties to develop and submit to the\n\ndistrict court a proposed desegregation order “tailored to the specific circumstances\n\nof the Gardendale City Schools System.” And it added that the proposal should\n\n“redraw the lines for Snow Rogers and Gardendale Elementary to address capacity\n\nissues at Gardendale Elementary.” The district court then explained that it would\n\nconsider a renewed motion by the Gardendale Board for the operation of all city\n\nschools, “Kindergarten through 12,” in three years if the Gardendale Board\n\noperated the two elementary schools “in good faith compliance with the anticipated\n\ndesegregation order.”\n\n      The district court ordered counsel for all parties to develop a proposed\n\nfacilities plan for the students attending Bragg Middle and Gardendale High. The\n\nplan would either place Gardendale High under the control of Jefferson County or\n\nplace the high school facility in “an anticipated K-12 Gardendale district.” In that\n\ncase, the Gardendale Board would have to make an “appropriate payment” to the\n\nJefferson County Board to help fund another facility. The Jefferson County Board\n\nmust retain the middle and high schools until the district court orders otherwise.\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 31 of 61\n\n\nAnd the Jefferson County Board must permit middle and high school students from\n\nNorth Smithfield to attend a school of their choice for the 2017–18 academic year.\n\nThe plaintiffs, the United States, and the Jefferson County Board must then submit\n\na joint proposal for the permanent zoning of the students. The district court also\n\nordered the Gardendale City Council to appoint at least one black resident of\n\nGardendale to the Gardendale Board within 60 days.\n\n      After the plaintiffs moved the district court to reconsider its order, the\n\ndistrict court issued a supplemental opinion that defended its decision. The district\n\ncourt stated that prohibiting the secession might have been appropriate if it had\n\n“recently” issued a desegregation order and “kn[e]w that the [C]ounty, including\n\nGardendale, would be subject to federal supervision for years.” But because the\n\n1971 order was “45 years old, and federal oversight of the Jefferson County Board\n\nof Education may be nearing an end, . . . the [district] [c]ourt decided to place the\n\nGardendale Board under a new desegregation order that creates a fresh start for\n\nfederal supervision of all aspects of the public schools in Gardendale.” Without\n\nthat “new” order, the district court reasoned, the residents of Gardendale could\n\nlater try again to secede after the 1971 order is dissolved. The district court\n\nreasoned that it could not rely on its finding of a discriminatory purpose to prevent\n\na future secession because it “must weigh the possibility that the plaintiff class\n\nwould not succeed” in seeking “appropriate judicial review and relief” in the\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 32 of 61\n\n\nfuture. The district court also explained that it was concerned about the resentment\n\nNorth Smithfield students would experience if it enjoined the secession, and it\n\nstressed that North Smithfield students would now benefit from the ability to\n\nchoose the school they attend.\n\n      The district court maintained that its order was tailored to remedy the\n\nconstitutional violation by the Gardendale Board and restored those harmed to the\n\nposition they would have occupied had the violation not occurred. It stated that its\n\norder would reduce costs to the Jefferson County Board, give the Jefferson County\n\nBoard certainty, allow the residents of Gardendale and Jefferson County to “heal\n\nfrom this dispute,” and send a message “that any community contemplating\n\nseparation at the expense of Jefferson County’s desegregation efforts will pay a\n\nhigh price and will have no guarantee that the community will be able to separate.”\n\n      The district court gave special weight to the interests of black Gardendale\n\nresidents who supported the secession. It defended its decision to consider the\n\nmotivations of Gardendale residents who supported the secession for nonracial\n\nreasons on the ground that “the residents whom the [district] [c]ourt had in mind\n\nare African-American.” It later stated that it must consider the “message” that it\n\nwill send to black parents if it prohibits the secession and forces them to choose\n\nbetween “having their African-American children attend a public school system\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 33 of 61\n\n\nthat these parents consider deficient or of moving to a municipal system elsewhere\n\nin Jefferson County that will give these parents the control that they desire.”\n\n      The district court also revisited its finding that the secession would impede\n\nthe desegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board. It explained that although\n\n“it does not have a tool available that will enable it to erase the message of\n\ninferiority conveyed by the conduct of the Gardendale Board,” its order mitigated\n\nthe harm from the loss of Gardendale High and the displacement of students that\n\ncurrently attend Gardendale schools. It cited the requirement that Jefferson County\n\nretain control of the high school or receive an “appropriate payment.” And it stated\n\nthat it had “unambiguously signaled that it envisions the creation of a new middle\n\nand high school zone comprised of students” from a number of surrounding\n\ncommunities, including Mount Olive and North Smithfield. “Although the\n\n[district] [c]ourt did not explicitly order” that solution, it stated that its order would\n\ncreate, if implemented, a student population “more diverse” than the current\n\nstudent populations of the Gardendale middle and high schools.\n\n      In response to the plaintiffs’ argument that the district court was bound by\n\nprecedent and the law-of-the-case doctrine to deny the motion to secede, the\n\ndistrict court declared that Stout I was overruled or simply inapplicable. It stated\n\nthat Wright overruled the holding in Stout I that a district court must prohibit a\n\nsecession if it finds that the secession will impede the desegregation efforts of a\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f                Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 34 of 61\n\n\nlarger school district. And, in the alternative, the district court stated that it\n\n“believes that both the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court\n\nwould find that the age of this case diminishes the likelihood that Gardendale’s\n\nseparation would impede the county’s effort to fulfill its desegregation\n\nobligations.”\n\n                           II.

The district court considered the “specific sequence of events\n\nleading up to the challenged decision” when it reviewed the public comments\n\nmade by the secession supporters. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267. And it\n\nreasonably inferred that the secession leaders expressed “a desire to control the\n\nracial demographics of the four public schools in the City of Gardendale and the\n\nracial demographics of the city itself.” The district court also considered the\n\n“legislative [and] administrative history,” id. at 268, of the secession proposals and\n\nreasonably inferred that the secession leaders translated their discriminatory\n\npurpose into official action. That is, the Gardendale Board and its superintendent\n\ndevised secession plans that reflect the same desire to control the racial\n\ndemographics of the public schools as had been expressed by the secession leaders.\n\n      The Gardendale Board argues that the district court erred by imputing the\n\ndiscriminatory intent of private individuals to state actors, that the statements of\n\nprivate citizens are irrelevant, and that some of the statements should not have\n\nbeen admitted because they were not authenticated. The Gardendale Board also\n\nargues that the district court erred when it found that the statements of the private\n\ncitizens were racially discriminatory. We disagree.\n\n      To be sure, only a state actor can violate the Fourteenth Amendment, but\n\nconstituent statements and conduct can be relevant in determining the intent of\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 38 of 61\n\n\npublic officials. In Arlington Heights, the Supreme Court explained that\n\n“[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor\n\ndemands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent\n\nas may be available.” Id. at 266. And as examples of the type of evidence that may\n\nbe considered, it listed the “historical background” of a decision and the “specific\n\nsequence of events leading up to the challenged decision.” Id. at 267. For example,\n\nwe have relied on evidence about the work of private lobbyists to hold that a\n\ndistrict court did not clearly err when it ruled that two state constitutional\n\namendments were “financially, and not discriminatorily, motivated.” I.L., 739 F.3d\n\nat 1287. The district court in I.L. made its finding based on a record of “massive\n\nresistance to substantial property tax increases; heavy support from the Alabama\n\nFarm Bureau Federation, a powerful lobbying organization; and a clash between\n\nrural and urban interests.” Id. at 1287 (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted). And in Washington v.

Nor did it, as the Gardendale Board argues, impermissibly ascribe the\n\nracially discriminatory motivations of a few to the actions of the Gardendale Board\n\nas a whole. The district court instead understood that the statements of those who\n\nplayed a primary role in lobbying for the state action “translate[d] their grassroots\n\neffort into official action.” And the secession leaders became members of the\n\nGardendale Board and advisory board. They testified that they “began having\n\nconversations with the mayor . . . and the council,” and that they “put the mayor\n\nand the council in a head lock until they came to their own conclusions that the\n\nschool system had to happen.” They lobbied the Gardendale City Council to\n\nimpose a five-mill tax, and they spearheaded the referendum initiative to impose an\n\nadditional five-mill tax.

The\n\nFacebook posts were the contents of a page that was controlled by the secession\n\nleaders and used to advocate for the proposed secession. And the posts were\n\nproperly authenticated for that purpose. For example, the Gardendale Board\n\nconceded that the posts by someone with the username Chris Lucas were made by\n\nChris Lucas. Tim Bagwell admitted that he was an active poster and made one of\n\nthe comments ascribed to him. And David Salters likewise admitted to\n\nparticipating in some of the Facebook discussions. Of course, the Gardendale\n\nBoard was free to challenge the weight given to the Facebook posts, but they were\n\nplainly admissible.\n\n      Finally, the Gardendale Board argues that the district court clearly erred\n\nwhen it found that the online comments prove discriminatory intent. It maintains\n\nthat the comments have no racially discriminatory subtext and prove only that the\n\nresidents of Gardendale wanted “to improve test scores, shrink class sizes, and\n\nreduce the number of students whose parents do not pay Gardendale property\n\ntaxes.” We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 42 of 61\n\n\n      The findings by the district court are more than “plausible in light of the\n\nrecord viewed in its entirety,” and we would “overstep[] the bounds of [our] duty\n\nunder [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 52(a)” if we reversed—even if we were\n\n“convinced that [we] would have decided the case differently.” Holton, 425 F.3d at\n\n1351. As an appellate court, we do not have the luxury of deciding factual issues\n\nde novo. We affirm the finding that the Gardendale Board acted with a racially\n\ndiscriminatory purpose because that finding is amply supported by this record.\n\n        B. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err When It Found That the\n       Secession of Gardendale Would Impede the Desegregation Efforts of the\n                              Jefferson County Board.\n\n      In the alternative, the district court found that the secession of Gardendale\n\nwould impede efforts to desegregate the schools operated by the Jefferson County\n\nBoard. The Gardendale Board challenges that finding by arguing that the Jefferson\n\nCounty schools have already achieved unitary status and that, in any event, the\n\nsecession would not impede the desegregation efforts of the Jefferson County\n\nBoard. These arguments fail.\n\n                1. Jefferson County Has Not Achieved Unitary Status.\n      The Gardendale Board argues that Jefferson County has already been\n\ndeclared unitary, but to support that argument, the Gardendale Board recites a few\n\nout-of-context statements from the decision of our predecessor circuit in Stout III.\n\nFor example, in Stout III, the former Fifth Circuit stated that “the former dual\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 43 of 61\n\n\nschool system [in Jefferson County] has been effectively dismantled and a unitary\n\nsystem substituted,” and later, it added that the district court found that “in\n\nJefferson County[,] the uprooting of which the Court spoke has been done and a\n\nunitary system is operating.” 537 F.2d at 802; see also id. at 803 (“[O]ur guiding\n\nlights are the trial court’s conclusions that the Jefferson County system has been\n\neffectively desegregated and is unitary and that these three one-race schools are the\n\nproducts of geography and demography alone.”). But both the Supreme Court and\n\nthis Court have cautioned against reading these kinds of statements out of context.\n\nThe whole of the Stout III opinion makes clear that Jefferson County has not fully\n\nfulfilled its desegregation obligations and remains subject to judicial oversight.\n\n      The Gardendale Board confuses two uses of the term “unitary,” a mistake\n\nthe Supreme Court identified in Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public\n\nSchools v. Dowell when it explained that “lower courts have been inconsistent in\n\ntheir use of the term ‘unitary.’” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (1991). Our predecessor circuit\n\ndid not rule that the school system had achieved “unitary status,” a declaration that\n\nwould be appropriate only if it had “eliminated the vestiges of its prior\n\ndiscrimination and ha[d] been adjudicated as such through the proper judicial\n\nprocedures.” Id.

It meant instead that the school system “ha[d]\n\ncurrently desegregated student assignments,” whether or not “vestiges of past\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f               Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 44 of 61\n\n\ndiscrimination” still remained. Id. Although the former Fifth Circuit stated that the\n\nJefferson County schools were no longer formally segregated, it also ruled that the\n\nschool system “must continue under the scrutiny and surveillance of the district\n\ncourt” and that “it would be appropriate, though [not] require[d] . . ., for the district\n\ncourt to give especial and renewed consideration to the possibility of broadening\n\nand making more attractive its existing majority-to-minority transfer procedures\n\nand to the possibility of enriching and strengthening the curriculum to magnet\n\nlevels” in two facilities. Stout III, 537 F.2d at 803. That mandate of continued\n\njudicial oversight means that our predecessor circuit certainly did not “adjudicate[]\n\n[the unitary status of Jefferson County] through the proper judicial procedures.”\n\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (quoting Ga. State Branches of NAACP, 775 F.2d at 1413\n\nn.12).\n\n         To hold that Stout III declared that Jefferson County had achieved unitary\n\nstatus would contravene the principle that “‘substance, not semantics, must govern’\n\nin remedying school segregation.” Holton, 425 F.3d at 1340 (alteration adopted)\n\n(quoting Swann, 402 U.S. at 31). Stout III “makes clear” that the court did not\n\nintend to make a unitary-status determination, and “thus, it is wholly irrelevant\n\nwhat precise language the . . . court used.” Id. (quoting Lee v.

Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. (Ross I), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"347667\"><a href=\"/opinion/347667/delores-ross-united-states-of-america-plaintiff-intervenor-v-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 943, 944 (5th\n\nCir. 1977), and the seceding district “bear[s] a heavy burden to show the lack of\n\ndeleterious effects on desegregation,” Ross II, 583 F.2d at 714; see also Ross I, 559\n\nF.2d at 945 (“[T]he burden remains on [the splinter district] to establish that its\n\nimplementation and operation will meet the tests . . . for permitting newly created\n\ndistricts to come into being for parts of districts already under an ongoing court\n\ndesegregation order.”). To satisfy its burden, the splinter district “must express its\n\nprecise policy positions on each significant facet of school district operation,”\n\nwhich includes all “areas of public school operations or support which the district\n\ncourt may specify as pertinent to the accomplishment of its underlying\n\ndesegregation order.” Ross I, 559 F.2d at 944.\n\n      In Wright, the Supreme Court considered three factors in particular: (1) the\n\npotential change in the racial composition of the city and county schools; (2) the\n\nease of identifying the predominant race of the resulting school systems “by\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 46 of 61\n\n\nreference to the racial composition of teachers and staff, the quality of school\n\nbuildings and equipment, or the organization of sports activities”; and (3) the\n\nmessage the secession would send to black schoolchildren. 407 U.S. at 464–66\n\n(quoting Swann, 402 U.S. at 18). The Supreme Court made clear that “[t]he\n\nweighing of the[] factors to determine their effect upon the process of\n\ndesegregation is a delicate task that is aided by a sensitivity to local conditions, and\n\nthe judgment is primarily the responsibility of the district judge.” Id. at 466; see\n\nalso id. at 466 n.13 (“Because of their proximity to local conditions and the\n\npossible need for further hearings, the courts which originally heard these cases\n\ncan best perform this judicial appraisal.” (quoting Brown v.

We will reverse a finding that a\n\nproposed secession will impede desegregation efforts only if the district court\n\nclearly erred. See, e.g., Ross II, 583 F.2d at 715 n.6.\n\n      The district court did not clearly err when it found that the secession of\n\nGardendale would have a substantial adverse effect on the desegregation efforts of\n\nthe Jefferson County Board. The district court provided three rationales for the\n\nfinding: the Gardendale school system would inherit Gardendale High, students\n\ndisplaced from the Gardendale schools would attend less racially diverse schools,\n\nand the secession movement communicated “messages of inferiority” to black\n\nstudents. Together, the three rationales support a finding that the secession will\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\f              Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 47 of 61\n\n\nadversely affect efforts to desegregate Jefferson County. See Holton, 425 F.3d at\n\n1351.\n\n        We cannot fault the finding that the loss of Gardendale High will impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board. Gardendale High houses a\n\nsophisticated career technical program strategically located to attract students from\n\nacross the County. And both the Supreme Court and this Court have endorsed\n\nthese kinds of magnet programs because they “have the advantage of encouraging\n\nvoluntary movement of students within a school district in a pattern that aids\n\ndesegregation on a voluntary basis, without requiring extensive busing and\n\nredrawing of district boundary lines.” Missouri v.

In addition, the secession would not provide desegregation transfer\n\nopportunities, which would mean that black students from the surrounding areas in\n\nJefferson County would be required to travel further to take advantage of that\n\npolicy. The result, as the district court explained, would likely be a decline in\n\nstudents seeking to transfer schools. There would also be an obvious financial\n\neffect from the change in ownership with repercussions for the feasibility of other\n\ndesegregation-related programs. And as we explained in Ross II, the district court\n\nis permitted to consider the “adverse financial [e]ffect [of a secession] on future\n\ndesegregation efforts.” 583 F.2d at 715.\n\n      The Gardendale Board argues that the district court “could have ordered\n\nGardendale to keep th[e] [magnet] program open to County students without\n\npreference for Gardendale residents,” but the burden rested with Gardendale—not\n\nthe district court—to show that its plan would not impede the desegregation efforts\n\nof the Jefferson County Board. Because the Gardendale Board failed to satisfy that\n\nburden, the district court was entitled to find that the change in ownership militated\n\nagainst permitting the secession. See id. at 714.\n\n      Nor did the district court clearly err when it weighed evidence that the\n\nsecession of Gardendale would result in fewer desegregated schools in Jefferson\n\nCounty. The district court found that the secession would force students at Bragg\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 49 of 61\n\n\nMiddle School and Gardendale High School to attend far less racially diverse\n\nschools.

The district court reasoned that throughout the\n\nsecession effort, “both words and deeds have communicated messages of\n\ninferiority and exclusion.” It cited the Facebook comments, the “flyer bearing a\n\nphotograph of a white student,” the “public rejection of transfer students” by\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 50 of 61\n\n\nGardendale residents, the failure of the Gardendale Board to “disavow[] the\n\nbelittling language of exclusion used by [secession] organizers and supporters,” the\n\ninconsistent treatment of the North Smithfield children in the different draft\n\nsecession plans, the failure of the Gardendale Board to “ma[k]e [a] commitment”\n\nto North Smithfield students, and the Gardendale superintendent’s decision to\n\nattend Gardendale community events even though he refused an invitation to meet\n\nwith the parents of North Smithfield students. In other words, as the Supreme\n\nCourt did in Wright, the district court found that the secession movement\n\ncommunicated a “message” that “cannot have escaped the [black] children in the\n\n[C]ounty.” 407 U.S. at 466.\n\n      True, the factual context in Wright was different. There, a predominantly\n\nwhite splinter district sought to secede immediately after a desegregation order\n\nissued. Id. at 465–66. But the Supreme Court did not limit its reasoning to\n\nmessages of inferiority that result from the timing of a secession attempt. District\n\ncourts may consider the message communicated for any number of reasons if a\n\nsecession attempt “generates a feeling of inferiority” in black students that is akin\n\nto the message condemned in Brown I. Id. at 466 (quoting Brown I, 347 U.S. at\n\n494). Here, the timing of the message was different, but the message was the same.\n\n      The argument of the Gardendale Board that “[t]here is no Equal Protection\n\nright to be shielded from offensive messages” is wholly beside the point. Neither\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\f               Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 51 of 61\n\n\nthe district court nor the plaintiffs ever suggested that the secession effort violated\n\nsuch a right. The district court reasoned that the official acts of the Gardendale\n\nBoard and other Gardendale officials, when considered in the light of the history of\n\nthe secession movement, communicated a message that was intolerable under\n\nWright.\n\n      The district court did not clearly err. Its “account of the evidence is plausible\n\nin light of the record viewed in its entirety.” Holton, 425 F.3d at 1351. Indeed, the\n\nrecord amply supports its finding that the secession would impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board. And “we cannot overturn the\n\ndistrict court’s finding of fact simply because [other] evidence [i]s merely\n\nconflicting.” Id. at 1354 (alteration adopted) (quoting Ga. State Conference of\n\nBranches of NAACP, 775 F.2d at 1419).\n\n          C. The District Court Abused Its Discretion By Permitting a Partial\n                                       Secession.\n\n      Although the district court did not clearly err when it made its factual\n\nfindings, we agree with the plaintiffs and the Jefferson County Board that it abused\n\nits discretion when it modified the desegregation order. By sua sponte amending\n\nthe 1971 order to permit the partial secession of Gardendale, the district court\n\nmisapplied the law governing both splinter districts and race discrimination. And it\n\ndevised a novel remedy by weighing legally irrelevant—and sometimes legally\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 52 of 61\n\n\nprohibited—factors. Both of the factual findings made by the district court permit\n\nonly one ruling: denial of the motion to secede.\n\n      The district court erred when it ruled that a partial secession could be\n\npermitted even though the Gardendale Board had not proved a “lack of deleterious\n\neffects on desegregation.” Ross II, 583 F.2d at 714. Because the Gardendale Board\n\nwas the moving party, it bore the burden of proof. Our precedents make clear that a\n\nsplinter district must propose and defend a secession plan that will not impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the school district subject to an ongoing desegregation\n\norder. When the splinter district fails to satisfy that burden, “the district court may\n\nnot . . . recognize [its] creation,” Stout I, 448 F.2d at 404 (citation omitted). For\n\nexample, in Ross II, we declared that “[t]he division of a school district operating\n\nunder a desegregation order can be permitted only if the formation of the new\n\ndistrict will not impede the dismantling of the dual school system in the old\n\ndistrict,” and “[i]n such a situation, the proponents of the new district must bear a\n\nheavy burden to show the lack of deleterious effects on desegregation.” 583 F.2d at\n\n714. Similarly, in Ross I, we explained that the burden to show that the\n\n“implementation and operation” of a splinter district “meet[s] the tests outlined for\n\npermitting newly created districts to come into being” remains at all times with the\n\nsplinter district. 559 F.2d at 945. To satisfy that burden, the splinter district “must\n\nexpress its precise policy positions on each significant facet of school district\n\n\n\n                                           52\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 53 of 61\n\n\noperation.” Id. at 944. When the Gardendale Board failed to satisfy its burden, the\n\ndistrict court should have denied the motion before it.\n\n      Although the district court acknowledged that at least one precedent, Stout I,\n\nrequired it to prohibit the secession, it erroneously concluded that the Supreme\n\nCourt overruled that precedent in Wright and granted district courts greater\n\ndiscretion over whether to permit a splinter district. The district court read the\n\nstatement in Wright, 407 U.S. at 460, that “[i]f [a secession] proposal would\n\nimpede the dismantling of [a] dual system, then a district court, in the exercise of\n\nits remedial discretion, may enjoin it from being carried out” as granting a district\n\ncourt more flexibility. But Wright never suggested that a district court could\n\nfashion a more limited secession plan of its own making when it finds that a\n\nproposed plan would impede desegregation. Wright instead “h[e]ld only that a new\n\nschool district may not be created where its effect would be to impede the process\n\nof dismantling a dual system.” Id. at 470.\n\n      The district court also erred when it ruled that it was not bound to follow\n\nStout I under the law-of-the-case doctrine, which provides that earlier decisions\n\n“bind[] all subsequent proceedings in the same case” as to “both findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law.” United States v. Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 668 (11th Cir.\n\n2014) (alteration adopted and citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\ndistrict court stated that “the facts of this case have changed” and that “it would\n\n\n\n                                          53\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 54 of 61\n\n\nwork a manifest injustice for th[e] [district] [c]ourt not to take the lack of activity\n\nin the case into account.” Although there are “limited exceptions to the law-of-the-\n\ncase doctrine [for situations in which] ‘there is new evidence, an intervening\n\nchange in controlling law dictates a different result, or the appellate decision, if\n\nimplemented, would cause manifest injustice because it is clearly erroneous,’” id.\n\nat 668–69 (quoting Litman v.

Milliken v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (1977); see also\n\nJenkins, 515 U.S. at 88. But in those cases, the courts were not faced with a motion\n\nto amend an extant desegregation order. The 1971 order issued to ensure that the\n\nJefferson County Board “eliminate[d] the vestiges of the unconstitutional de jure\n\nsystem” so that “the principal wrong of the de jure system, the injuries and stigma\n\ninflicted upon the race disfavored by the violation, is no longer present.” Holton,\n\n425 F.3d at 1337 (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 485). Faced with a motion to\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 56 of 61\n\n\namend that order by a school board motivated by invidious discrimination, the\n\ndistrict court was obliged to deny the motion.\n\n       The district court failed to abide by the mandate to “restore the victims of\n\ndiscriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of\n\nsuch conduct.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 88 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Here, the clear way to “restore,” “as nearly as possible,” “the victims of\n\n[the] discriminatory conduct” was to deny the motion to secede. Id. (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). If the motion were denied, black schoolchildren\n\nwho attend Gardendale schools would continue to benefit from the supervision of\n\nthe Jefferson County Board, which is governed by a federal order to desegregate its\n\nschools. When the district court rejected this option in favor of permitting a new\n\nboard created, in part, for the purpose of racial discrimination to control the\n\neducational policy of at least two schools, it abused its discretion. Its finding of a\n\nracially discriminatory purpose required the district court to deny the motion to\n\nsecede in its entirety.\n\n       Instead of denying the motion to secede, the district court—unprompted by\n\neither party—devised its own secession plan. In doing so, it weighed a number of\n\nimpermissible considerations and thereby abused its discretion.\n\n       The district court speculated that the 1971 order may soon be dissolved, and\n\nit drew a series of impermissible conclusions from that supposition. The district\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\f              Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 57 of 61\n\n\ncourt stated that if it permitted the secession, it would be “reluctant” to release\n\nJefferson County from the 1971 order because of the “evidence of racial\n\nmotivation in this case.” In its later supplemental opinion, it appeared to be less\n\nconcerned that Jefferson County might fail to obtain a unitary-status determination\n\nthan that it would succeed. According to the district court, if Jefferson County were\n\nto succeed, the residents of Gardendale could again attempt to secede and, in that\n\nscenario, “there would be no federal desegregation order to protect zoning,\n\ninterdistrict transfers, and the Gardendale high school facility.” So it decided “to\n\nplace the Gardendale Board under a new desegregation order that creates a fresh\n\nstart for federal supervision of all aspects of the public schools in Gardendale.” It\n\nadded that the new order was appropriate because the plaintiffs may not be able to\n\nprove racially discriminatory purpose in the future and, without a constitutional\n\nviolation, it would be unable to protect the plaintiffs. It stated that it is “not a safe\n\nassumption” that “in a few years, the situation in Gardendale will be identical to\n\nthe set of circumstances that produced the [district] [c]ourt’s finding that the\n\nGardendale Board violated the Fourteenth Amendment.” And it explained that it\n\nhad to “weigh the possibility that the plaintiff class would not succeed” in proving\n\nracially discriminatory purpose.\n\n       Multiple errors plague this reasoning. As a threshold matter, the district\n\ncourt had no basis to speculate about the possibility that Jefferson County might or\n\n\n\n                                            57\n\f             Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 58 of 61\n\n\nmight not obtain a determination of unitary status. The district court acknowledged\n\nthat it “[did] not have before it information that [would] allow[] it to determine just\n\nhow close Jefferson County may be to the end of supervision.”\n\n      The district court was faced with a motion to amend the 1971 order and\n\nerred when it described its order as imposing a “new desegregation order.” When a\n\nsplinter district moves to secede from a school district governed by a desegregation\n\norder, the movant seeks to modify that order. So when the district court permitted\n\nthe Gardendale Board to operate a new school system, it modified the 1971 order.\n\nIf the district court had imposed an entirely new desegregation order, that order\n\nwould have been unlawful. A new desegregation order may not be imposed to\n\nguard against the possibility that a constitutional violation will either soon be\n\nremedied or no longer exist. A desegregation order must instead remedy state-\n\nsanctioned segregation that has already been adjudicated. See, e.g., Jenkins, 515\n\nU.S. at 88 (“[F]ederal-court decrees must directly address and relate to the\n\nconstitutional violation itself.” (quoting Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282)). Although a\n\nracially discriminatory purpose motivated it to secede, the Gardendale Board had\n\nnot implemented its plan so as to require a judicial remedy to unravel it. In other\n\nwords, the Gardendale Board only proposed to violate the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nand the district court was obliged to reject that proposal.\n\n\n\n\n                                          58\n\f             Case: 17-12338      Date Filed: 02/13/2018    Page: 59 of 61\n\n\n       The district court also erred when it speculated that the possible social\n\ntension caused by finding a constitutional violation would warrant allowing the\n\nviolation to succeed in part. The district court stated that it had to consider the\n\ninterests of students from North Smithfield who “may feel unwelcome in\n\nGardendale schools” if it denied the motion to secede. But even if the plaintiffs had\n\nsuggested—contrary to their litigating position—that such a concern was plausible,\n\nthe history of school desegregation is rife with conflict. Indeed, if animosity alone\n\ncould thwart constitutional imperatives, Brown II would have been in error. As the\n\nSupreme Court put it then, “the vitality of . . . constitutional principles cannot be\n\nallowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.” Brown II, 349 U.S. at\n\n300.\n\n       And the district court erred when it suggested that the benign motivations of\n\nsome Gardendale residents could cure the discriminatory motivation of the\n\nGardendale Board. The district court stated that it “must, to the extent practicable,\n\nhonor the wishes of parents who support a local system simply because they want\n\ngreater control over their children’s education.” But even if the parents the district\n\ncourt identified were state actors relevant to the constitutional analysis, Wright\n\nmade clear that when a locality attempts to secede from a school district subject to\n\nan ongoing desegregation order, “[t]he existence of a permissible purpose cannot\n\nsustain an action that has an impermissible effect.” 407 U.S. at 462. Even more\n\n\n\n                                           59\n\f              Case: 17-12338     Date Filed: 02/13/2018     Page: 60 of 61\n\n\nconcerning, the district court gave special weight to the concerns of some\n\nGardendale parents because of their race, which should be—and is—legally\n\nirrelevant.\n\n      At oral argument, the plaintiffs’ counsel represented that they and the\n\nJefferson County Board expect later this year to present the district court a plan for\n\nthe final resolution of this litigation, which has lasted more than a half century. We\n\nencourage that effort to bring this remedial phase to an end. In the meantime, both\n\nWright and our precedents about splinter districts still govern the Gardendale\n\nBoard.\n\n         Of course, we do not suggest that the Gardendale Board of Education is\n\n“forever [a] vassal[] of the [C]ounty [B]oard.” Stout II, 466 F.2d at 1215. The\n\nauthority of the judiciary to intervene in the “local autonomy” of Jefferson County,\n\nJenkins, 515 U.S. at 99, is tied to the constitutional violation at issue: the earlier de\n\njure segregation of schools. If the Gardendale Board, for permissible purposes in\n\nthe future, satisfies its burden to develop a secession plan that will not impede the\n\ndesegregation efforts of the Jefferson County Board, then the district court may not\n\nprohibit the secession. We do not belittle the “need that is strongly felt in our\n\nsociety” to have “[d]irect control over decisions vitally affecting the education of\n\none’s children.” Wright, 407 U.S. at 469. Indeed, the “local autonomy of school\n\ndistricts is a vital national tradition.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 99. We hold only that the\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\f             Case: 17-12338    Date Filed: 02/13/2018   Page: 61 of 61\n\n\ndesire for local autonomy must yield when a constitutional violation is found and\n\nremains unremedied.\n\n                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n    We AFFIRM IN PART, REVERSE IN PART, and REMAND WITH\nINSTRUCTIONS TO DENY THE MOTION OF THE GARDENDALE\nBOARD TO SECEDE.\n\n\n\n\n                                        61\n\f</pre>",
