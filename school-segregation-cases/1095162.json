See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:\n\nBrett Yader,1 a minor, by his parents and next friends Mark and\nWendy Yader, appeals from the district court's decision denying the\nYaders' reimbursement for the costs of unilaterally placing Brett at\nthe Grove School (Grove), a private institution in Madison, Connecti-\ncut. A state administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that Brett\nYader was denied a free appropriate public education pursuant to the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.A.\n§ 1400 et seq. (West 1990 & Supp. 1997), and granted the Yaders'\nrequest for reimbursement of the cost of Brett's residential placement\nat Grove for the 1996-1997 school year. The Board of Education of\nMontgomery County (the Board), filed suit against the Yaders in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland challenging\nthe ALJ's decision, and the district court reversed.\n\nWe agree with the district court that the Montgomery County Pub-\nlic School System (the school system) adequately complied with the\nprocedural requirements of the IDEA and that it provided Brett Yader\nwith an appropriate placement pursuant to the IDEA. We also con-\nclude that the district court did not err in applying this Circuit's stan-\ndard of review of state administrative decisions under the IDEA.\nThus, we affirm the district court's decision.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 The caption for the case in federal district court was originally styled\nBoard of Educ. of Montgomery County v. Brett Y., to protect the identity\nof the minor. The parties stated at oral argument, however, that they had\nno objection to the use of Brett's full name.\n\n                    2\n\fI.\n\nThe IDEA is a complex statute designed to provide free appropriate\neducational services to the more than eight million children with dis-\nabilities in the United States. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1400 (West Supp.\n1997). The IDEA amended the Education of the Handicapped Act, 20\nU.S.C.A. § 1401 et seq. (West 1990), which provided federal funds\nto state and local agencies to assist in the education of handicapped\nchildren, conditioning such funding upon the states' compliance with\nmandated goals and procedures.2\n\nThe IDEA, like its predecessor, requires that all children with dis-\nabilities be provided with a \"free appropriate public education\"\n(FAPE). 20 U.S.C.A. § 1400(c) (West Supp. 1997). FAPE is defined\nas special education and related services that: (1) are provided under\npublic supervision and at public expense without cost to parents; (2)\nmeet the standards of the state educational agency; (3) include an\nappropriate preschool, elementary, or secondary school education;\nand (4) are provided in conformity with the individualized education\nprogram required by § 1414(a)(5) of the Act. See 20 U.S.C.A.\n§ 1401(a)(18) (West 1990).\n\nTo receive funds from a state educational agency, local educational\nagencies and intermediate educational units must provide assurance\nthat they will develop an \"individualized education program\" (IEP)\nfor each child with a disability at the beginning of each school year\nand will review and, if appropriate, revise, the IEP's provisions peri-\nodically, but not less than annually. See 20 U.S.C.A. §§ 1401(a)(20),\n1414(a)(5) (West Supp. 1997). The IEP is a written statement devel-\noped through a meeting of a representative of the local educational\nagency, the child's teacher, the child's parent or guardian, and, when\nappropriate, the child. See 20 U.S.C.A.§ 1401(a)(20) (West Supp.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 The 1990 amendments substituted\"Individuals with Disabilities Edu-\ncation Act\" for \"Education of the Handicapped Act.\" See Pub. L. No.\n101-476, § 901(a)(1), 104 Stat. 1103, 1141-42 (1990), codified at 20\nU.S.C.A. § 1400(a) (West Supp. 1997). For ease of reference, we refer\nonly to the IDEA, even when discussing cases interpreting the Act prior\nto the 1990 amendments. See Gadsby v. Grasmick , 109 F.3d 940, 942 n.1\n(4th Cir. 1997).\n\n                    3\n\f1997). The IEP must include: (1) a statement of the child's present\nlevels of educational performance; (2) a statement of annual goals,\nincluding short-term objectives; (3) a statement of the specific educa-\ntional services to be provided to the child and the extent to which the\nchild will participate in regular educational programs; (4) a statement\nof the needed transition services for students beginning no later than\nage 16 and annually thereafter; (5) the date for the initiation and dura-\ntion of the educational services; and (6) objective criteria and evalua-\ntion procedures and schedules for determining, at least annually,\nwhether the instructional objectives are being achieved. See id.\n\nThe IDEA also requires that prior written notice be given to the\nparents of a child whenever a local education agency or intermediate\neducational unit proposes to initiate or change the identification, eval-\nuation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a\nFAPE to the child. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(b)(1)(C) (West 1990). If\na complaint is made regarding any of these matters, the parents must\nbe provided an impartial due process hearing conducted by the state\neducational agency, local educational agency, or intermediate educa-\ntional unit, as determined by state law. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(b)(2)\n(West 1990).3\n\nMaryland law requires that a parent's request for a due process\nhearing be made through the Office of Administrative Hearings. See\nMd. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-413(c) (Michie 1997). The Office of\nAdministrative Hearings will then appoint an impartial ALJ to review\nthe child's education placement. See id. Within 180 days of the hear-\ning decision, any party may appeal to the United States District Court\nfor the District of Maryland or to the circuit court for the county in\nwhich the student resides. See id. at § 8-413(h).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 The federal regulations implementing the IDEA similarly provide that\na parent or a public educational agency may initiate an impartial due pro-\ncess hearing on any matters relating to the initiation or change in the\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the pro-\nvision of a FAPE to a child, or the refusal to initiate or change the identi-\nfication, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the provision\nof a FAPE to a child. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.504(a)(1) & (2), 300.506\n(1997).\n\n                    4\n\fThe IDEA requires that state educational agencies establish and\nmaintain procedures to ensure that children with disabilities and their\nparents are guaranteed procedural safeguards in the state agencies'\nprovision of a FAPE. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415 (West Supp. 1997). In\nkeeping with this requirement, Maryland has promulgated regulations\nimplementing its Education Article, Title 8, Subtitles 3 and 4, which\nguarantee a FAPE for all students with disabilities. See Md. Regs.\nCode tit. 13A, § 05.01 (1989).\n\nMaryland's implementing regulations require that an IEP must be\napproved by an Admission, Review, and Dismissal Committee (ARD\nCommittee). See Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A, § 05.01.08 (1991). The\nARD Committee is to be composed of a chairman designated by the\nlocal superintendent, individuals who are familiar with the student's\nfunctioning (including a special educator and interdisciplinary person-\nnel from the public agency and the local health department), and other\nappropriate persons, such as those expected to become deliverers of\ndirect service to the student. See Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,\n§ 05.01.08(A) (1991). An ARD Committee meeting must be open to\nthe child's parents, who shall be notified of the meeting at least 10\ndays in advance. See Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-405 (Michie 1997).\n\nII.\n\nBrett Yader is a severely emotionally disturbed high school stu-\ndent. He has been diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, anxi-\nety disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAlthough Brett has experienced emotional problems for which he has\nreceived therapy intermittently since the age of five, none of his emo-\ntional problems affected his education until he reached the eighth\ngrade.\n\nBrett attended the Montgomery County Public Schools in Mont-\ngomery County, Maryland, during the 1994-95 and 1995-96 school\nyears. In May of 1995, while attending Takoma Park Middle School,\nBrett was diagnosed with ADHD. In response, the school prepared an\naccommodation plan for Brett.\n\nIn the fall of 1995, Brett began ninth grade at Richard Montgomery\nHigh School. In October, Brett's accommodation plan was routinely\n\n                    5\n\freviewed, and he was performing well academically. Brett's atten-\ndance during the fall of 1995 declined, however. As a result, the\nschool system began a screening process on December 6, 1995, which\neventually led to an evaluation by the ARD Committee.\n\nOn January 17, 1996, the ARD Committee met to evaluate Brett.\nThe Committee determined that Brett was disabled and eligible for\nspecial education services. The Yaders attended this meeting. The\nARD Committee developed an IEP for the remainder of the 1995-96\nschool year. At the request of the Yaders, the IEP stated that Brett\nwas \"other health impaired\" rather than \"seriously emotionally\ndisturbed.\"4 (J.A. at 178.) The ARD Committee determined that Brett\nwould receive Intensity II5 special education services during the\nremainder of the 1995-96 school year at the Richard Montgomery\nHigh School.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 The federal regulations implementing the IDEA state that \"other\nhealth impairment\" means \"having limited strength, vitality or alertness,\ndue to chronic or acute health problems such as a heart condition, tuber-\nculosis, rheumatic fever, nephritis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, hemo-\nphilia, epilepsy, lead poisoning, leukemia, or diabetes that adversely\naffects a child's educational performance.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.7(b)(8)\n(1997).\n\nAccording to the regulations, \"serious emotional disturbance\" is\ndefined as:\n\n        a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteris-\n        tics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that\n        adversely affects a child's educational performance-- (A) An\n        inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sen-\n        sory, or health factors; (B) An inability to build or maintain satis-\n        factory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers; (C)\n        Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circum-\n        stances; (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depres-\n        sion; or (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears\n        associated with personal or school problems.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.7(b)(9) (1997).\n\n5 The Maryland regulations provide in part that Intensity II services\n\"may be considered appropriate for the student who may be appropri-\nately served by receiving service through the special education program,\nnot to exceed an average of 1 hour per school day.\" Md. Regs. Code tit.\n13A, § 05.01.10(E)(3) (1991).\n\n                    6\n\fThe IEP was reviewed after sixty days. The March 6, 1996, review\nindicated that Brett's attendance at school had \"greatly improved,\"\nand that he was performing well academically. Comments made by\nBrett's family, however, indicated that Brett \"was going into crisis at\nhome,\" (J.A. at 174), and that he possibly needed hospitalization.\n(J.A. at 175.) Although he was attending school regularly, Brett's\nbehavior at home was characterized by his parents as\"angry, border-\ning on violen[t].\" (J.A. at 290.)\n\nOn April 17, 1996, an ARD Committee meeting was held to con-\nduct a review of Brett's IEP. The ARD Committee concluded that\nBrett's academic performance had continued to improve in Intensity\nII placement. Brett attended Richard Montgomery High School for\nthe remainder of the 1995-96 school year. Brett's school attendance\nrapidly declined, however, near the end of the school year. On or\nabout June 10, 1996, Brett stopped attending school altogether. He\nslept all day, stayed up all night, and refused to leave his home or his\nbed. In response to this crisis, Brett's parents had him evaluated at the\nSheppard Pratt Psychiatric Hospital, but had to request police inter-\nvention to get Brett to attend the evaluation. Although after his evalu-\nation Brett was admitted to the American Day Treatment Center in\nChevy Chase, Maryland, for the most part he refused to attend the\nprogram.\n\nOn June 19, 1996, another ARD Committee meeting was con-\nvened. The IEP developed at this ARD meeting stated for the first\ntime that Brett was \"seriously emotionally disturbed.\" (J.A. at 177.)\nThe ARD Committee determined that Brett's needs could not be met\nin a general education program and recommended a therapeutic day\nschool.\n\nBrett's folder was forwarded to the Montgomery County Public\nSchools' central office for consideration of whether his special educa-\ntion services should be increased to Intensity V or VI,6 and, if so, for\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 The Maryland regulations define Intensity V services in part as \"ap-\npropriate for the student who requires a more intensive special education\nprogram than Intensities I-IV.\" Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,\n§ 05.01.10(E)(6) (1991). The regulations define Intensity VI services in\n\n                    7\n\fa determination of an appropriate placement for Brett.7 David Cross,\na placement specialist with the Montgomery County Public Schools,\nreceived Brett's file on approximately July 12, 1996.8 Mr. Cross testi-\nfied that he reviewed Brett's file the next day and determined that it\nneeded to be supplemented with an updated psychological evaluation.\nHe requested an evaluation from the school psychologist, Dr. Rene\nJohnson. Dr. Johnson made two attempts to obtain a psychological\nevaluation of Brett but was unable to do so because Brett would not\ncooperate. Mr. Cross then requested that a psychologist from the\nschool system's \"Rapid Response Team\" attempt to perform a psy-\nchological evaluation. That psychologist was also unsuccessful in\nobtaining an updated evaluation of Brett because Brett would not\nleave the house. After these unsuccessful attempts to obtain a further\npsychological evaluation of Brett, Mr. Cross scheduled a CARD\nCommittee meeting9 for August 26, 1996.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npart as \"appropriate for the student who requires special education pro-\ngramming and related services in a residential setting. This includes 24-\nhour special education and related services if determined by the Admis-\nsion, Review, and Dismissal Committee to be necessary to implement the\nstudent's individualized education program.\" Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,\n§ 05.01.10(E)(7) (1991).\n\n7 In the Montgomery County Public School System, if a student's spe-\ncial education needs cannot be met within his current school setting, the\nchild's file is referred to the central office for consideration whether the\nchild needs Intensity V or VI services. The file must be reviewed by a\nplacement specialist to determine whether it requires any additional\ninformation. Next, a Central Admission, Review, and Dismissal (CARD)\nCommittee meeting must be scheduled for an evaluation of the student\nand recommendation for appropriate services. As with an ARD Commit-\ntee meeting, the CARD Committee meeting must be open to the child's\nparents, who shall be notified of the meeting at least 10 days in advance.\n\n8 The ALJ found that \"[t]here is no dispute that the file was sent to the\ncentral offices on or before June 30, 1996 although no one was able to\ndocument the exact date.\" (J.A. at 315.) There is no explanation why Mr.\nCross, the placement specialist, did not receive the file until approxi-\nmately July 12.\n\n9 In the Montgomery County Public School System, if a student\nrequires Intensity V or VI services and his needs cannot be met within his\ncurrent school setting, a Central Admission, Review, and Dismissal\n(CARD) Committee meeting must be scheduled to evaluate the student\nand recommend appropriate services. See discussion ante, n.7.\n\n                    8\n\fMeanwhile, Mrs. Yader visited the educational and treatment facil-\nities at both the Regional Institute for Children and Adolescents\n(RICA) and Grove during the summer of 1996. On July 15, 1996, the\nYaders, through counsel, requested a due process hearing to review\nthe school system's identification, evaluation, or placement for spe-\ncial education services for Brett. Although Brett was accepted at\nGrove on or about July 17, 1996, the Yaders did not withdraw their\ndue process hearing request.\n\nDue to other student meetings, both counsel for the Yaders and Mr.\nCross were unavailable on August 26, 1996, so the CARD Committee\nmeeting was convened instead on August 30, 1996. At that meeting,\nBrett's IEP was modified to recommend that Brett be offered Inten-\nsity V services with a possible residential placement to address his\nnon-educational needs. Brett was given an interim placement at Rich-\nard Montgomery High School with Intensity III services.10 The\nCARD Committee referred Brett for an interview at RICA in Rock-\nville, Maryland, and told the Yaders that a place was being held for\nBrett at RICA for the 1996-97 school year.11 The Yaders' counsel\nmade clear that Brett would not attend RICA even if he were accepted\nafter the interview because the Yaders had already made plans for\nBrett to attend Grove. Nevertheless, Brett interviewed at RICA on\nSeptember 4, 1996, and was accepted into the residential program.\n\nThe Montgomery County Public School System's school year\nbegan on September 3, 1996. Counsel for the Yaders was notified of\nBrett's acceptance at RICA in writing by a letter dated September 10,\n1996. The Yaders were notified in writing by a letter dated September\n12, 1996, that Brett had been accepted at RICA for Intensity V special\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 The Maryland regulations provide that Intensity III services \"may be\nconsidered appropriate for the student who may be appropriately served\nby receiving special educational services not to exceed an average of 3\nhours per school day.\" Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,§ 05.01.10(E)(4) (1991).\n\n11 RICA is jointly funded and operated by the State of Maryland's\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Montgomery County\nPublic Schools. The Montgomery County Public School System, how-\never, cannot make a placement at RICA, but can only refer a child to\nRICA for an interview. RICA then determines whether the child is an\nappropriate candidate and should be admitted to its program.\n\n                   9\n\feducation and enrollment in the residential program to address Brett's\nnon-educational needs. As stated earlier, however, Brett previously\nhad been enrolled at Grove and attended Grove for the entire duration\nof the 1996-97 school year.\n\nBecause the Yaders had requested a due process hearing on July\n15, 1996, the ALJ held hearings on October 1, 1996, and November\n1, 1996, to review Brett's placement. The ALJ issued a decision on\nDecember 16, 1996, finding that the school system had committed\nserious procedural violations of the IDEA, denying Brett a FAPE. The\nBoard appealed the ALJ's decision, and, after a bench trial, the dis-\ntrict court reversed. The Yaders now appeal, arguing that the district\ncourt failed to apply the proper standard of review, that the school\nsystem did not comply with the procedural requirements of the IDEA\nin the development of Brett's IEP, and that the school system's ulti-\nmate placement did not meet Brett's special education needs.\n\nIII.\n\nTo determine whether the Yaders are entitled to reimbursement for\nplacing Brett at Grove during the 1996-97 school year, we must deter-\nmine whether the August 30, 1996, IEP proposed by the CARD Com-\nmittee was appropriate. In determining whether an IEP is appropriate\nand whether the school system has fulfilled its obligations to provide\na student with a FAPE, the proper inquiry is twofold. See Board of\nEduc. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982). We must decide: (1)\nwhether the State has complied with the IDEA's procedural require-\nments in developing and implementing the IEP and (2) whether the\nIEP is \"reasonably calculated\" to enable the child to receive educa-\ntional benefits. See id. at 206-07. The failure to meet the procedural\nrequirements of the Act itself is an \"adequate groun[d] . . . for holding\nthat a school failed to provide . . . a FAPE.\" Hall v. Vance County Bd.\nof Educ., 774 F.2d 629, 635 (4th Cir. 1985).\n\nCourts reviewing state administrative decisions in IDEA cases\nmust make \"independent decision[s] based on a preponderance of the\nevidence.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 205 (internal quotation omitted) (alter-\nation in original). It is implicit in the IDEA, however, that the review-\ning court should give due weight to administrative findings. See id.\nat 206. This Circuit further refined the standard of review in Doyle v.\n\n                    10\n\fArlington County Sch. Bd., 953 F.2d 100 (4th Cir. 1992), holding that\nfindings of fact by administrative law judges and hearing officers in\nIDEA cases \"are entitled to be considered prima facie correct, akin to\nthe traditional sense of permitting a result to be based on such fact-\nfinding, but not requiring it.\" Id. at 105. Furthermore, we noted that\n\"when fact-findings are regularly made and entitled to prima facie\ncorrectness, the district court, if it is not going to follow them, is\nrequired to explain why it does not.\" Id.\n\nIn reviewing the findings of the ALJ and the district court with\nregard to Brett's need for a residential placement, we are bound by\nthe same standard of review set forth by the Supreme Court in Rowley\nand later refined by this Circuit in Doyle. We must \"make an indepen-\ndent decision based on a preponderance of the evidence, while giving\ndue weight to state administrative proceedings.\" Id. at 103 (citing\nRowley, 458 U.S. at 206).\n\nThe Yaders argue that the district court failed to give due deference\nto the ALJ's findings of fact, as required by this Court's mandate in\nDoyle, resulting in reversible error. We disagree. We conclude that,\nwhile the district court did reject several of the ALJ's findings of fact,\nthe district court adhered to the appropriate standard of review by pro-\nviding well reasoned explanations for rejecting the ALJ's findings.12\n\nA. Procedural Requirements\n\nThe ALJ determined that the school system committed two serious\nprocedural violations that caused Brett to lose educational opportu-\nnity. First, the ALJ concluded that the school system's extensive\ndelay in convening the CARD Committee meeting and its resulting\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12 The district court never specifically cited Doyle. The district court\ndid, however, cite a district court case which articulated the Doyle stan-\ndard. See Board of Educ. of Montgomery County v. Brett Y., No. 97-364,\nat 8-9 (D. Md. July 9, 1997) (citing Sanger v. Montgomery County Bd.\nof Educ., 916 F. Supp. 518, 521 (D. Md. 1996)). While it would have\nbeen preferable for the district court to rely on this Court's precedent, the\ndistrict court did not apply the incorrect standard of review merely\nbecause it relied upon a district court case stating the same legal stan-\ndard.\n\n                    11\n\ffailure to develop and implement the IEP in a timely fashion caused\nBrett to lose educational opportunity. Second, the ALJ concluded that\ndeficiencies in the IEP caused Brett to lose educational opportunity.13\nIn considering whether the district court was correct in rejecting the\nALJ's findings, we keep in mind that the deferential standard\nannounced in Doyle also extends to the ALJ's findings regarding the\nBoard's compliance vel non with the procedural requirements of the\nIDEA. See Doyle, 953 F.2d at 106 n.6. We agree with the district\ncourt that any delay by the school system in convening a CARD\nCommittee meeting and any deficiencies in the IEP did not deny Brett\neducational opportunity.\n\n1.\n\nFirst, the ALJ found that the delay in convening the CARD Com-\nmittee meeting -- from June 19, 1996 to August 30, 1996 -- caused\nBrett to lose educational opportunity. The ALJ also found that \"there\nwas no IEP in effect at the start of the school year.\" (J.A. at 315.)\n\nThe ALJ stated, \"[w]hat is most troubling about the procedural his-\ntory in this case is the extended delay between the June 19, 1996\nARD meeting and the CARD meeting held on August 30, 1996.\"\n(J.A. at 315.) The district court agreed that \"it would have been pref-\nerable for [the school system] to act more expeditiously to finalize\nBrett's IEP and make a placement decision.\" (J.A. at 463.) The dis-\ntrict court concluded, however, that the timing of events was not so\negregious as to constitute a violation by the school system of Brett's\nprocedural rights provided under the IDEA.\n\nIn keeping with the deferential standard of review announced in\nDoyle, the district court gave reasons for rejecting the ALJ's finding.\nThe district court noted that after the June 19, 1996, ARD meeting,\nBrett's file was sent to the central placement office, where it arrived\non approximately July 12, 1996. Mr. Cross testified at the bench trial\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13 While the ALJ characterized these deficiencies as procedural, the dis-\ntrict court characterized them as substantive. Whether the alleged defi-\nciencies in the IEP are characterized as procedural or substantive,\nhowever, does not change our conclusion that Brett was not denied a\nFAPE.\n\n                    12\n\fthat it normally took a month to schedule a CARD Committee meet-\ning from the time the central placement office received the file, but,\nin this case, the first open date was approximately six weeks from the\ndate Brett's file was received, on August 26, 1996.14\n\nThe ALJ stated, \"I see nothing in either the federal or State regula-\ntions that entitles a public agency to do nothing because it's summer\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14 There is some confusion in the record and in the district court's opin-\nion about the school system's usual length of time for scheduling a\nCARD Committee meeting. We must only determine, however, whether\nthe district court properly held that the school system complied with the\nrequirements of the IDEA. The IDEA requires that the IEP must be\nestablished or revised \"at the beginning of each school year and [then\nreviewed] and, if appropriate, [revised], .. . periodically, but not less\nthan annually.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1414(a)(5) (West Supp. 1997); see also\nGadsby v. Grasmick, 109 F.3d 940, 950 (4th Cir. 1997) (noting that fail-\nure to develop an IEP prior to the beginning of the school year violates\nIDEA); Combs v. Rockingham County Sch. Bd., 15 F.3d 357, 358 (4th\nCir. 1994) (noting IDEA requires that schools establish IEP, review it\nannually, and revise it when appropriate). Furthermore, in conjunction\nwith the federal regulations, the Secretary of Education noted that \"the\ntiming of meetings to develop, review, and revise IEPs is left to the dis-\ncretion of each agency\" and \"[m]eetings may be held any time through-\nout the year, as long as IEPs are in effect at the beginning of each school\nyear.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.343 note (1997). Brett's IEP, which was origi-\nnally established on January 17, 1996, was reviewed after sixty days on\nMarch 6, 1996; reviewed again on April 17, 1996; reviewed and revised\non June 19, 1996, after Brett's behavior and performance had declined;\nand reviewed again on August 30, 1996, at the CARD Committee meet-\ning. Thus, Brett's IEP was reviewed four times within the year it was ini-\ntially developed and prior to the beginning of the school year. We\nconclude this was sufficient to meet the requirements of the IDEA.\n\nWe note that the Yaders requested at the June 19, 1996, ARD Commit-\ntee meeting that a CARD Committee meeting be convened as quickly as\npossible. We acknowledge that the IDEA emphasizes parental involve-\nment and that the school system could have acted more quickly to honor\nthe Yaders' request to have Brett's case expedited. Although the school\nsystem's handling of Brett's case was not a model of efficiency, the\nschool system has to deal with many cases. In short, although the school\nsystem could have acted more quickly, it did not violate the statute's\nrequirements.\n\n                    13\n\ftime.\" (J.A. at 318.). Contrary to the ALJ's assertion, the district court\ncorrectly noted that the Secretary of Education's interpretive guide-\nlines do recognize that time constraints may be relaxed during the\nsummer or a vacation period. The interpretive guidelines provide that\nan IEP must be implemented as soon as possible, except when the\nmeetings occur during the summer or a vacation period. See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.342(b) note (1997).15 Furthermore, as the district court found,\nthe school system was not \"doing nothing.\" It was attempting to\nobtain a psychological evaluation and then was moving forward to\nschedule the CARD Committee meeting. While we agree with the\ndistrict court that in hindsight it would have been ideal if the school\nsystem had treated this case as an emergency and acted immediately,\nthe statute and regulations do not require the school system to act\nmore expeditiously than it did.\n\nThe district court also rejected the ALJ's finding that there was no\nIEP in effect at the start of the school year. In accordance with Doyle,\nthe district court explained its rationale for finding that Brett's IEP\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15 The Secretary of Education has authority to issue rules and regula-\ntions to carry out the provisions of the IDEA. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1417(b)\n(West 1990).\n\nThe Secretary's interpretive guidelines, like the EEOC's guidelines\ninterpreting Title VII and the ADA, are \"not controlling upon the courts\nby reason of their authority.\" Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S.\n57, 65 (1986). When consistent with the statute, they do \"constitute a\nbody of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants\nmay properly resort for guidance.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and cita-\ntion omitted); see also Halperin v. Abacus Technology Corp., 128 F.3d\n191, 199 n.12 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\nWe believe that the interpretive guideline's exception for summer or\nvacation periods is consistent with the federal regulation's requirement\nthat an IEP be implemented \"as soon as possible following the meetings\nunder § 300.343,\" see 34 C.F.R. § 300.342 (1997), because the school\nsystem is likely not to be offering educational services during those peri-\nods and, therefore, could not practically implement the IEP. We do not\nreach the question, however, of whether the interpretive guideline would\nremain consistent with the regulation in a situation where the school sys-\ntem is offering special education services during a summer school ses-\nsion.\n\n                     14\n\fwas \"in effect\" following the August 30, 1996, CARD Committee\nmeeting and that the IEP was timely implemented. While we adopt\na slightly different rationale from the district court, we agree that the\nIEP was developed and implemented at the beginning of the school\nyear in accordance with the requirements of the IDEA.\n\nTo determine what the IDEA requires for an IEP to be developed\nin a timely fashion, we begin by examining the language used in the\nstatute. See Shafer v. Preston Memorial Hosp. Corp., 107 F.3d 274,\n277 (4th Cir. 1997). \"When Congress does not expressly define a stat-\nutory term or phrase, a court should normally construe it in accord\nwith its ordinary or natural meaning.\" Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). \"In most cases, if the statutory language is plain and admits\nof no more than one meaning, the duty of interpretation does not\narise, and . . . the sole function of the courts is to enforce [the statute]\naccording to its terms.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (alter-\nation in original).\n\nWith these principles of statutory interpretation in mind, we con-\nsider the relevant statutory language. The IDEA conditions the receipt\nof federal funds upon the requirement that local educational agencies\nand intermediate educational agencies submit an application to the\nstate educational agency. According to the IDEA,\"[s]uch application\nshall . . . provide assurances that the local educational agency or inter-\nmediate educational unit will establish or revise, whichever is appro-\npriate, an individualized education program for each child with a\ndisability . . . at the beginning of each school year and will then\nreview and, if appropriate, revise, its provisions periodically, but not\nless than annually.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1414(a)(5) (West Supp. 1997). The\nMontgomery County school year began on September 3, 1996. There-\nfore, according to the plain meaning of the statute, Brett's IEP was\ntimely if \"established or revised\" prior to September 3, 1996. Because\nBrett's IEP, which was originally established on January 17, 1996,\nwas revised at the CARD Committee meeting on August 30, 1996, we\nconclude that it was developed in a timely fashion.\n\nThe ALJ concluded that Brett's IEP was not in effect at the start\nof the school year because Brett had only been provided the opportu-\nnity to interview at RICA and had not yet been formally accepted into\nRICA's residential program. The statute merely requires, however,\n\n                     15\n\fthat an IEP contain \"a statement of the specific educational services\nto be provided to [the] child.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1401(a)(20) (West Supp.\n1997). The IEP stated that Brett would receive Intensity V special\neducation services, with an interagency option for residential place-\nment. Thus, it did contain a statement of the services to be provided.\nBecause we conclude that this description of services met Brett's edu-\ncational needs,16 we conclude that, contrary to the ALJ's assertion, the\nIEP was properly in effect. Furthermore, Maryland's regulations\nallow thirty days for implementation of the IEP.17 See Md. Regs.\nCode tit. 13A, § 05.01.09(C) (1991). Thus, the school system had a\nshort period of time to implement the IEP, and RICA did accept Brett\ninto the residential program within thirty days.18\n\nIn concluding that Brett's IEP was timely, the district court relied\nupon both the Secretary of Education's federal regulations and inter-\npretive guidelines. The federal regulations provide:\n\n         (a) At the beginning of each school year, each public\n        agency shall have in effect an IEP for every child with a dis-\n        ability who is receiving special education from that agency.\n\n        (b) An IEP must--\n\n        (1) Be in effect before special education and\n       related services are provided to a child; and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16 See discussion post , at 20-24.\n\n17 See discussion post , at 17-19.\n\n18 As we noted ante, n. 11, RICA is jointly funded and operated by the\nState of Maryland's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the\nMontgomery County Public Schools. The Montgomery County Public\nSchool System cannot make a residential placement at RICA, but can\nonly refer a child to RICA for an interview. RICA then determines\nwhether the child is an appropriate candidate and should be admitted to\nits program. As counsel for the Board noted during oral argument, the\nschool system ultimately provided Brett with a placement that would\nallow therapeutic treatment during the day at RICA for Brett's educa-\ntional needs and a residential placement for Brett's non-educational\nneeds.\n\n                    16\n\f         (2) Be implemented as soon as possible follow-\n        ing the meetings under § 300.343.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.342 (1997) (emphasis added). In addition, the Secre-\ntary's interpretive guidelines provide that an IEP is considered \"in\neffect\" when the IEP (1) has been developed properly (at meetings\ninvolving all of the participants specified in the statute); (2) is\nregarded by both the parents and agency as appropriate with respect\nto the child's needs, goals and objectives, and services to be provided;\nand (3) will be implemented as written. See 34 C.F.R. pt. 300 app. C\n(question 3) (1997).\n\nThe district court, finding that all three requirements in appendix\nC, question 3, were met, concluded that the IEP was \"in effect\" as of\nAugust 30, 1996. First, the district court found that the IEP was devel-\noped properly at a meeting involving all of the participants specified\nin the statute, noting that Brett's parents attended the August 30,\n1996, CARD Committee meeting. Second, the district court con-\ncluded that Brett's parents regarded the IEP as appropriate with\nregard to Brett's needs, goals and objectives, and services to be pro-\nvided. Finally, the district court concluded that the school system\nsought to implement the IEP as written by arranging an interview for\nBrett at RICA. As the district court noted, the school system and the\nYaders knew that a place was being held for Brett at RICA. Finding\nthat all three requirements were met, the district court concluded that\nthe IEP was \"in effect\" prior to the beginning of the school year.\n\nWe question the district court's conclusion that the Yaders agreed\nthat the IEP was appropriate. First, the district court erred in finding\nthat the IEP was signed by Brett's parents.19 The ALJ correctly found\nthat neither the Yaders nor the CARD Committee chairman signed the\nIEP. Second, the Yaders' disagreement with the IEP and Brett's\nplacement is the fundamental dispute underlying this action.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 While the district court erred in finding that the IEP was signed by\nBrett's parents, the fact that the Yaders did not sign the IEP does not nec-\nessarily prevent the IEP from being \"in effect\" pursuant to the interpre-\ntive guidelines. The interpretive guidelines themselves state that parents\nare not required to sign IEPs. See 34 C.F.R. pt. 300 app. C (question 29)\n(1997).\n\n                    17\n\fWe need not dwell on whether the parents signed the IEP, whether\nthey agreed that it was appropriate, or whether the school system\ncomplied with the interpretive guideline because we believe that the\nsecond element of the interpretive guideline is inconsistent with the\nstatute. The second element of the guideline requires that, to be \"in\neffect,\" the IEP must be \"regarded by both the parents and agency as\nappropriate with respect to the child's needs, goals and objectives,\nand services to be provided.\" See 34 C.F.R. pt. 300 app. C (question\n3) (1997). In some cases, the parents, although involved in the process\nof developing the IEP, will ultimately disagree with the substantive\ncontent of the IEP. In such cases, the recourse available to parents is\nto request a due process hearing, see 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(b)(2) (West\n1990), and, if necessary, to unilaterally withdraw their child and place\nthe child in a different educational setting pending the resolution of\ntheir claim, see Burlington School Committee v. Department of Educ.,\n471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985). See also Florence County Sch. Dist. v.\nCarter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993) (holding parents may be reimbursed for\nunilateral placement even if private school did not meet requirements\nof IDEA or state standards). If, as the interpretive guideline suggests,\nparents could simply refuse to agree with an IEP and thereby prevent\nthe IEP from being properly \"in effect,\" school boards could never\nfully comply with the IDEA's procedural requirements.20 We believe\nthis is not the practical effect the statute and regulations were\ndesigned to create.21 We agree with the district court that Brett's IEP\nwas properly in place at the beginning of the school year in compli-\nance with the IDEA. Because the Secretary's interpretive guideline is\ninconsistent with the statute, however, we rely, as we must, upon the\nstatute's plain meaning. See Kmart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20 The district court alludes to this inconsistency between the interpre-\ntive guideline and the statute but never fully discusses it. See Board of\nEduc. of Montgomery County v. Brett Y., No. 97 364, at 12 n.2 (D. Md.\nJuly 9, 1997).\n\n21 We do not mean to imply that school systems can exclude parents\nfrom full participation in the development of the IEP. The IDEA requires\nparental involvement. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1401(a)(20) (West Supp. 1997).\nWe have also noted that the \"spirit and intent\" of the IEP development\nprocess \"emphasizes parental involvement.\" Spielberg v. Henrico County\nPub. Sch., 853 F.2d 256, 259 (4th Cir. 1988) (holding school system\nerred in making placement determination prior to development of IEP).\n\n                    18\n\f281, 291 (1988) (noting courts do not defer to agency's interpretation\nto alter the express intent of Congress).\n\nBecause the ALJ found that the IEP was not in effect at the start\nof the school year, it follows that she could not have concluded that\nthe IEP was timely implemented. The district court disagreed. We\nalso conclude that the district court was correct in its assessment that\nBrett's IEP was implemented in a timely fashion. The IDEA does not\naddress what is required for the timely implementation of an IEP once\nit has been developed. It is well-established that when a \"statute is\nsilent or ambiguous with respect to [a] specific issue, the question for\nthe court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\" Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). The fed-\neral regulations provide that an IEP must \"[b]e implemented as soon\nas possible following the meetings under § 300.343.\" 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.342 (1997). The interpretive guidelines state that the special\neducation services specified in an IEP must be provided \"as soon as\npossible\" following the meeting and that \"no delay is permissible.\"\nSee 34 C.F.R. Pt. 300 app. C (question 4) (1997). The Maryland regu-\nlations specifically provide that the IEP \"shall be implemented as\nsoon as possible and not more than 30 school calendar days following\nits development.\" Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A, § 05.01.09(C) (1991).\n\nWe believe that although both phrases are somewhat ambiguous,\nthe interpretive guideline's statement that \"no delay is permissible\" is\nplainly inconsistent with the federal regulation's statement that the\nIEP must be implemented \"as soon as possible.\" Compare 34 C.F.R.\nPt. 300 app. C (question 4) (1997) with 34 C.F.R. § 300.342 (1997).\nWe believe, however, that Maryland's thirty-day period is well within\nthe federal regulations' requirement that implementation of the IEP\noccur \"as soon as possible.\" Cf. Gadsby v. Grasmick, 109 F.3d 940,\n954 n.5 (4th Cir. 1997) (noting parents \"failed to show that Mary-\nland's interagency review process for out-of-state residential place-\nments under IDEA causes undue delays in the implementation of\nproposed IEPs\"). We, therefore, conclude that the interpretive guide-\nline's provision that \"no delay is permissible\" in the implementation\nof the IEP is inconsistent with the federal regulations. Both the Secre-\ntary's federal regulation providing that the IEP must be implemented\n\"as soon as possible\" and the Maryland regulation's requirement that\n\n                    19\n\fthe IEP must be implemented within thirty days, however, are based\nupon permissible constructions of the statute.\n\nThe IEP was developed on August 30, 1996. The Yaders were\ninformed that Brett was accepted at RICA on September 12, 1996. As\nthe district court noted, \"Brett's IEP could have been implemented at\nRICA by the middle of September, well within the 30 school calendar\ndays that [the school system] had to implement the IEP without com-\nmitting a procedural violation.\" (J.A. at 461.) Thus, the district court\ndid not err in rejecting the ALJ's finding of fact that the implementa-\ntion of the IEP was untimely.\n\n2.\n\nSecond, the ALJ concluded that deficiencies in the IEP caused\nBrett to lose educational opportunity. Specifically, the ALJ found that\nthe school system's failure to include appropriate objective criteria\nand evaluation procedures for measuring goals, internal inconsisten-\ncies in the IEP, and failure to update the IEP to reflect the extent of\nBrett's disability and most recent educational performance were pro-\ncedurally deficient under the IDEA.22 Even assuming that these defi-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n22 Although the dissent finds fault with the substantive content of the\nIEP, it concedes that the school district complied with the procedural\nrequirements of the IDEA. See post at 29-30. It is well-settled that \"ade-\nquate compliance with the procedures prescribed . . . in most cases\nassure[s] much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substan-\ntive content in an IEP.\" See Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206\n(1982). We believe that this case is no exception.\n\nThe dissent apparently believes that the substantive content of the IEP\nwas inadequate despite the Board's compliance with the Act's procedural\nrequirements. The dissent cites the IEP's failure to acknowledge that\nBrett had gone into a \"crisis\" and refused to attend class altogether, its\nfailure to update goals and methods from previous IEPs, and the incon-\nsistency in its methods for reaching prescribed goals. When the IEP was\nrevised in June of 1995, however, Brett's complete refusal to attend class\nwas just surfacing. Moreover, between June and August, the school sys-\ntem could not get Brett to agree to an evaluation, so it had little new\ninformation upon which to rely in revising the IEP.\n\nWe agree with the ALJ and the district court that the IEP developed\non August 30, 1996, could have been improved. The school system is not\n\n                    20\n\fciencies in the IEP existed, we agree with the district court that none\nof the alleged deficiencies relied upon by the ALJ constituted a denial\nof a FAPE.\n\nTo support a finding that a student has not been provided with a\nFAPE, procedural violations must be serious and cause the student to\nlose educational opportunity. See Burke County Bd. of Educ. v.\nDenton, 895 F.2d 973, 982 (4th Cir. 1990) (finding school board's\nviolation of state and federal procedural notice requirements did not\ncause student to lose educational opportunity). The ALJ's primary\nconcerns about the procedural deficiencies in the IEP were that one\ngoal was unchanged from the April 1996 meeting (although the goal\nwas approved by Brett's parents as part of the IEP at the June 1996\nmeeting); at least two of the goals and objectives were unchanged\nsince the June 1996 meeting; Brett's educational performance was not\nmodified at the June or August meetings; the IEP failed to list the\nappropriate accommodations for a student recommended for a Inten-\nsity V; and the IEP neglected to list Brett's failure to attend class or\nschool. While we agree with both the ALJ and the district court that\nthe IEP developed on August 30, 1996, could have been improved,\nnone of these alleged procedural violations rises to a level indicating\nthat Brett lost educational opportunity.\n\nThat some goals were unchanged, in and of itself, is not significant.\nThe ALJ failed to articulate or specify how the goals had become out-\nmoded. In fact, the first goal listed on the IEP-- demonstrating\nacceptance of school routines by attending school on a regular basis\nand attending all classes on time -- clearly was a consistent, and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nrequired, however, to develop a perfect IEP. Instead, the proper standard\nis whether the IEP is \"reasonably calculated\" to confer educational bene-\nfit. See id. at 206-07. We agree with the First Circuit when it stated:\n\n        The IDEA does not promise perfect solutions to the vexing prob-\n        lems posed by the existence of learning disabilities in children\n        and adolescents. The Act sets more modest goals: it emphasizes\n        an appropriate, rather than an ideal, education; it requires an ade-\n        quate, rather than an optimal, IEP. Appropriateness and ade-\n        quacy are terms of moderation.\n\nLenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1086 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                    21\n\fprobably the most important, goal for Brett. Furthermore, without a\nfurther psychological evaluation by the school psychologist, the\nschool system had little new information on Brett's condition with\nwhich to revise the IEP, except the evaluations of the Sheppard Pratt\nHospital and the American Day Treatment Center, which the CARD\nCommittee did consider. Because Brett had not been in school since\nJune 10, he had no new academic evaluations, and thus his educa-\ntional performance would not have been modified. In addition, his last\ngrades for the 1995-96 school year were based only upon the work\nhe completed, and he received all As and Bs. Cf. John Doe v. Defen-\ndant I, 898 F.2d 1186, 1190 (6th Cir. 1990) (noting that student's\nmost recent grades were known by both his parents and school offi-\ncials). The district court concluded that \"[a]ny minor deficiencies in\nthe IEP in terms of describing Brett or setting objective criteria for\ngoals could have been corrected.\"23 (J.A. at 473.)\n\nFurthermore, the district court relied upon the Yaders' failure to\nchallenge any of the alleged deficiencies at the August 30, 1996,\nCARD Committee meeting when it concluded that the school system\ndid not deny Brett a FAPE. The district court noted that \"[n]owhere\ndid the Yaders challenge other aspects of the IEP as being sufficiently\ndeficient by themselves to constitute a denial of FAPE.\" (J.A. at 466.)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23 The dissent, relying upon Spielberg v. Henrico County Pub. Schs.,\n853 F.2d 256 (4th Cir. 1988), argues that after-the-fact correction of an\nIEP does not conform with the IDEA. The dissent's reliance upon\nSpielberg, however, is misplaced. See post at 34-35. In Spielberg, the\nplacement decision was made before the IEP was developed. In Brett's\ncase, the IEP was developed at a meeting attended by the Yaders, as\nrequired by 20 U.S.C.A. § 1401(a)(20) (West Supp. 1998). The Yaders\nparticipated in the development of the IEP and had the opportunity to\nmake objections. Thus, the school system here, unlike the school system\nin Spielberg, complied with the procedural requirements of the IDEA.\n\nWhile we agree with the dissent that modifications may not be made\nto an IEP without scheduling a meeting and notifying the parents in com-\npliance with 20 U.S.C.A. § 1401(a)(20), if a school system has met the\nprocedural requirements of the IDEA, minor deficiencies in the IEP do\nnot necessarily deny a child a FAPE. As long as the IEP is \"reasonably\ncalculated\" to enable the child to receive educational benefit, the child\nhas not been denied a FAPE. See Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S.\n176, 179-81 (1982).\n\n                    22\n\fInstead, the Yaders challenged only the issue of residential placement\nand timing of the placement.\n\nAlthough not cited by the district court, the testimony at the due\nprocess hearing and at the bench trial supports the district court's con-\nclusion. David Cross, placement specialist for the Montgomery\nCounty Public Schools, testified at the bench trial that everyone\nagreed to the specific goals and objectives discussed at the August 30,\n1996, CARD Committee meeting, and that neither the Yaders nor\ntheir counsel suggested that additional, specific goals needed to be\nadded. When asked whether she or her counsel had criticized the IEP\nat the August 30, 1996, meeting, Ms. Yader testified, \"I can't honestly\nsay.\" (J.A. at 162.) While the district court may have explained more\nfully why it rejected the ALJ's findings with respect to deficiencies\nin the IEP, we do not believe that the district court committed revers-\nible error under the Doyle standard. In conclusion, none of these\nalleged procedural deficiencies rose to the level of denying Brett edu-\ncational opportunity.\n\nB. Substance of IEP\n\nOnce we have determined that the state has complied with the\nIDEA's procedural requirements in developing and implementing the\nIEP, we turn to the second prong of the Rowley inquiry: whether the\nIEP is \"reasonably calculated\" to enable the child to receive educa-\ntional benefits.24 See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07. The CARD Com-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n24 The dissent is mistaken in its impression that we believe that compli-\nance with the IDEA's procedural requirements \"cures\" substantive defi-\nciencies in a child's IEP. See post at 30 n.1. We recognize, as our\nmajority opinion makes clear, that the Supreme Court's test in Rowley is\na two-pronged test. This Circuit has previously indicated, however, that\nthe second prong of the Rowley inquiry is more difficult to satisfy than\nthe first. See Tice v. Botetourt County Sch. Bd., 908 F.2d 1200, 1207 (4th\nCir. 1990). As we noted in Tice:\n\n        [T]he [Supreme] Court made clear in Rowley [that] once a proce-\n        durally proper IEP has been formulated, a reviewing court\n        should be reluctant indeed to second-guess the judgment of edu-\n        cation professionals. Neither the district court nor this court\n        should disturb an IEP simply because we disagree with its con-\n\n                    23\n\fmittee recommended Intensity V special education services, with an\n\"interagency option for [a] residential[placement],\" noting that Brett\nwas scheduled for an interview at RICA. (J.A. at 275.) In the mean-\ntime, Brett was given an interim placement of Intensity III services\nat Richard Montgomery High School. The interagency option for a\nresidential placement gave RICA the prerogative to enroll Brett as a\nresidential student upon its evaluation of Brett's needs.\n\nParents are entitled to reimbursement for their expenditures on pri-\nvate special education services \"if the court ultimately determines that\nsuch placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.\"\nBurlington, 471 U.S. at 369. Parents may place a child in a private\neducational institution if they disagree with the child's proposed IEP\nwithout waiving their right to potential reimbursement later, but they\ndo so at their own financial risk; they will be barred from obtaining\nreimbursement \"[i]f the courts ultimately determine that the IEP pro-\nposed by the school officials was appropriate.\" Id. at 374. The Yaders\nclaim that they are entitled to reimbursement for unilaterally placing\nBrett at Grove because the CARD Committee's Intensity V placement\nat RICA with an interagency option for residential services was inap-\npropriate to meet Brett's special education needs.\n\nWe have held that a residential placement that is necessary for\n\"medical, social, or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process\" need not be funded by the local education agency.\nDenton, 895 F.2d at 980. The ALJ made a conclusory determination\nthat Brett needed a residential placement for educational reasons, not-\ning under the \"Findings of Fact\" portion of her opinion that \"[Brett]\nneeds a residential placement in order to achieve educational benefit.\"\n(J.A. at 307.) Later, she stated, \"It is clear from the record, including\nthe testimony of Mr. Chorney and Ms. Kelty, as well as the reports\nfrom the American Day Treatment Program and Sheppard Pratt, that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n        tent. Rather, we must defer to educators' decisions as long as an\n        IEP provided the child \"the basic floor of opportunity that access\n        to special education and related services provides.\"\n\nId. (internal citation omitted) (quoting Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458\nU.S. 176, 207-08 (1982)). We believe that Brett's IEP provided him with\n\"the basic floor of opportunity.\" Id.\n\n                    24\n\fa residential program is necessary for [Brett] to achieve educational\nbenefit.\" (J.A. at 322.) The ALJ, however, did not provide well rea-\nsoned explanations for her determination that Brett needed a residen-\ntial placement for educational reasons. Thus, her finding with respect\nto Brett's need for residential placement for educational reasons is\nentitled to little weight. See Doyle, 953 F.2d at 105 (noting that in\ndetermining what weight to give an administrative decision we should\nconsider the ALJ's methods in arriving at his decision). For example,\nthe ALJ relied in part on Ms. Kelty's testimony, but Ms. Kelty, the\nprincipal of RICA, testified that it is \"a matter of semantics of\nwhether it's an educational reason or a clinical reason.\" (J.A. at 140).\nSimilarly, although she relied in part on the testimony of Mr.\nChorney, the executive director of the Grove School, the ALJ did not\nexplain why she drew the conclusion from Mr. Chorney's testimony\nthat Brett needed a residential placement for educational needs. While\nMr. Chorney testified that Brett \"definitely needs a residential pro-\ngram,\" (J.A. at 237), he did not refer to any educational reasons for\na residential placement. Instead, Mr. Chorney discussed the opportu-\nnity a residential placement at the Grove School provided for students\nto \"bond with staff since they spend so much time together.\" (J.A. at\n237.)\n\nThe district court rejected the ALJ's finding, concluding that the\nCARD Committee's proposed placement was sufficient to meet\nBrett's special education needs. The district court found that Brett's\neducational needs were segregable from his non-educational needs.\nBased upon a preponderance of the evidence, we conclude that the\ndistrict court did not err in determining that Brett's educational needs\nwere segregable from his non-educational needs and that it was his\nnon-educational needs which necessitated a residential placement.\n\nThere was consistent testimony at the administrative due process\nhearing indicating that Brett needed a residential placement. The evi-\ndence was equivocal, however, as to whether such placement was\nnecessary for educational or non-educational needs. For example, the\ntestimony of Mr. George Moore, a placement specialist and CARD\nCommittee member, was contradictory. Mr. Moore testified that \"get-\nting a child to school\" was both a \"parent need\" and \"an educational\nneed.\" First, Mr. Moore testified that getting a child to school \"[is] a\nfamily or parent responsibility.\" (J.A. at 60.) Upon further question-\n\n                    25\n\fing, however, he testified that it was a \"special education need\"\nbecause regular school attendance was listed as a need on Brett's IEP.\n(J.A. at 60.) Mr. David Cross, a placement specialist employed with\nthe Montgomery County Public School System who attended the\nAugust 30 CARD Committee meeting, testified less equivocally. He\nstated that after an \"active discussion by the committee members\" at\nthe CARD Committee meeting, they concluded that \"intensity five\nservices were sufficient for school purposes\" and \"[t]hat the reason\nfor residential services was for other reasons\" including \"family con-\ncerns [and] concerns with school attendance and other mental health\nissues.\" (J.A. at 88.) Later, Mr. Cross did state that with regard to the\ndifficulty in getting Brett to school, it was a matter of \"interpretation\nwhether it's educational or family related.\" (J.A. at 99.)\n\nMany of the witnesses consistently testified, however, that Brett\nperformed well academically when he was at school and had few\ndisciplinary problems at school. Mr. Moore testified that when Brett\nwas at school, \"he didn't cause problems,\" \"he did his work,\" and \"he\ndid fine.\" (J.A. at 20.) Much of the testimony regarding Brett's need\nfor a residential placement focused upon his hostile and oppositional\nbehavior at home and his parents' inability to get him to attend\nschool. For example, Mrs. Yader testified that in March of 1996\nBrett's attendance at school and academic performance were greatly\nimproved, and yet his behavior at home was angry and bordering on\nviolent. Mrs. Yader also testified that \"[b]ehavorial problems at\nschool isn't [sic] Brett's problem\" and that Brett does not have behav-\nioral problems \"with [anyone] else in the whole world\" except his\nfamily. (J.A. at 163.)\n\nThis testimony, taken together, points to the conclusion that Brett\nfunctioned well when in an academic setting and that his primary con-\nflicts arose at home with his parents. Residential care is only required\nif the \"educational benefits which can be provided through residential\ncare are essential for the child to make any educational progress at\nall.\" Denton, 895 F.2d at 980. Accordingly, the district court held that\nthe CARD Committee's placement decision was appropriate, follow-\ning this Circuit's holding that a residential placement that is necessary\nfor \"medical, social, or emotional problems that are segregable from\nthe learning process\" need not be funded by the local education agency.25\nSee id.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n25 The dissent contends that the most serious flaw with Brett's IEP was\nits failure to require a residential placement. See post at 30. We disagree.\n\n                    26\n\fThe Yaders claim that Grove was a more appropriate placement for\nBrett than RICA because it offered honors classes, such as advanced\nmath and chemistry, that RICA did not offer. The IDEA does not\nrequire, however, that a school system fund the best possible place-\nment for a child. \"The [IDEA] requires only that the child be able to\nbenefit from the instruction that [he] receives, not that [he] be able to\nmaximize [his] potential commensurate with the opportunity provided\nnonhandicapped children.\" Id. We conclude that Brett could have\nmade educational progress at RICA, in a residential placement for\nnon-educational reasons.\n\nIn making a placement suggestion, the CARD Committee had to\nconsider its obligation to comply not only with the statutory provi-\nsions of the IDEA, but also with those of the Code of Maryland and\nMaryland's regulations implementing the IDEA. Although the Mary-\nland Code provides that \"[a] child who needs special education ser-\nvices that are not provided in a public county, regional, or State\nprogram shall be placed in an appropriate nonpublic educational pro-\ngram that offers these services,\" see Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-\n406(a)(1) (Michie 1997), the Maryland regulations provide, inter alia,\nthat a student with disabilities may be considered for nonpublic place-\nment only when the local school system or the state and local agen-\ncies, or both, cannot offer the appropriate special education and\nrequired related services, see Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A, § 05.01.12(B)\n(1991). The CARD Committee, in making a placement determination,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nAs the dissent correctly argues, residential care is required if necessary\nfor the child to make any educational progress at all. See Burke County\nBd. of Educ. v. Denton, 895 F.2d 973, 980 (4th Cir. 1990). A residential\nplacement that is necessary for medical, social, or emotional problems\nsegregable from the learning process itself, however, need not be funded\nby the local educational agency. See id. The reason for Brett's failure to\nattend school was defiance toward his parents. Such oppositional and\ndefiant behavior is an emotional problem causally unrelated to the learn-\ning process. As we have previously stated, testimony at the due process\nhearing indicated that Brett functioned well when at school and per-\nformed well academically. Based on this, we agree with the district\ncourt's determination that Brett suffered from an emotional problem that\nis segregable from the learning process. Therefore, we conclude that the\nschool system's placement was proper.\n\n                    27\n\fmust also place a child as geographically close to the child's home as\npossible. See 34 C.F.R. § 300.552(a)(3) (1997).\n\nBased upon the preponderance of the evidence, we agree with the\ndistrict court that the placement at RICA with an interagency option\nfor residential services was proper. We have noted that \"once a proce-\ndurally proper IEP has been formulated, a reviewing court should be\nreluctant indeed to second-guess the judgment of education profes-\nsionals.\" Tice v. Botetourt County Sch. Bd. , 908 F.2d 1200, 1207 (4th\nCir. 1990) (citing Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207-08). We are required to\ndefer to educators' decisions as long as the IEP provides \"the basic\nfloor of opportunity that access to special education and related ser-\nvices provides.\" Id.\n\nIV.\n\nMindful of the deference due the ALJ under this Circuit's prece-\ndent in Doyle, we nevertheless affirm the district court's rejection of\nthe ALJ's findings. The district court, while acknowledging the find-\nings of the ALJ, adequately rebutted those findings before determin-\ning that the IEP was developed and implemented in a timely fashion\nat the beginning of the school year, that there were no serious proce-\ndural deficiencies that resulted in Brett's loss of educational opportu-\nnity, and that a residential placement to meet Brett's non-educational\nneeds was appropriate and complied with the IDEA. Accordingly, the\nYaders are not entitled to reimbursement for unilaterally placing Brett\nat Grove during the 1996-97 school year.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\nHAMILTON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nThe fundamental error in the majority's opinion is its holding that\nBrett's IEP was substantively sufficient to provide him with a free\nappropriate public education for the 1996-97 school year. See supra\nat 28. Because the IEP contains serious substantive defects that\ndenied Brett a free appropriate public education, the Yaders are enti-\ntled to reimbursement for enrolling Brett in the Grove School. I,\ntherefore, respectfully dissent.\n\n                    28\n\fI\n\nThe IDEA defines a \"free appropriate public education\" as special\neducation and related services that (1) are provided at public expense,\nunder public supervision and direction, and without charge; (2) meet\nthe standards of the State's educational agency; (3) include an appro-\npriate preschool, elementary or secondary school education in the\nState; and (4) are provided in conformity with the student's IEP. See\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(18). The IDEA requires that an IEP include, inter\nalia, (1) a statement of the student's present level of educational per-\nformance; (2) a statement of annual goals and short-term instructional\nobjectives; (3) a statement of specific educational services to be pro-\nvided to the student; and (4) appropriate objective criteria, evaluation\nprocedures and schedules for determining whether the instructional\nobjectives are being achieved. See 20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(20).\n\nThe IEP is intended to be the school district's \"blueprint\" for pro-\nviding a free appropriate public education to a disabled student. See\nSchool Comm. of Burlington, Mass. v. Department of Educ. of Mass.,\n471 U.S. 359, 368 (1985). Thus, it is logical to conclude that a pro-\ngram constructed on a faulty blueprint will itself be faulty. In other\nwords, when educational services are provided in conformity with an\nIEP that does not accurately reflect the student's circumstances or\nneeds, those educational services will neither address those circum-\nstances nor meet those needs.\n\nWe determine whether an IEP is appropriate and whether the\nschool district has fulfilled its obligations to provide a student with\na free appropriate public education by determining (1) whether the\nschool district has complied with the IDEA's procedural requirements\nwhen developing and implementing an IEP, and (2) whether the IEP\nis \"reasonably calculated\" to enable the child to receive educational\nbenefits. See Board of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v.\nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206-07 (1982). While I agree with the majority\nthat the school district complied with the procedural requirements of\nthe IDEA, see supra at 12-20, I disagree with the majority's implicit\nholding that the IEP accurately reflected Brett's circumstances and\nneeds, and was, therefore, reasonably calculated to provide him with\neducational benefits. My disagreement rests on the IEP's failure to (1)\ndocument the full extent of Brett's disability; (2) require a residential\n\n                    29\n\fplacement for educational purposes; (3) match its goals to its meth-\nods; and (4) reconcile its methods with placement at RICA.1\n\nOf these failures, the most obvious is the IEP's failure to note any-\nwhere that Brett had gone into \"crisis\" and refused entirely to attend\nclass. Without this information, the full extent of Brett's disability\ncould not be considered in developing a program that would provide\nhim with an adequate education. Furthermore, this omission caused\nthe IEP to misrepresent Brett's present level of educational perfor-\nmance. Since Brett refused to attend school, he was, perforce, making\nno educational progress.2\n\nThe omission of Brett's full disability at least contributed to--and\nperhaps caused--the IEP's most serious flaw, namely that the IEP\nfails to require a residential placement so that Brett can make educa-\ntional progress. Brett's refusal to attend classes should have been a\nsignificant factor in deciding whether a residential program was edu-\ncationally necessary. Since it was clear that a residential program\nwould be needed to get Brett to attend classes at all, then a fortiori\nit should have been clear that a residential program was educationally\nnecessary. The ALJ understood this, but the district court and major-\nity have failed to grasp or appreciate such logic. In concluding that\nBrett needed a residential placement--but for non-educational rea-\nsons only--the district court and the majority, see supra at 25-26,\nboth rely on the testimony of the parties' experts. The testimony both\ncited, however, does not support their conclusion. For example, Sherri\nKelty, the principal at RICA and one of the School Board's experts,\ntestified:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 I also disagree with the majority's apparent belief that complying with\nthe IDEA's procedural requirements somehow cures substantive defi-\nciencies in the IEP. See supra notes 22 and 23 at 20-21, 22. The Supreme\nCourt's test in Rowley is a two-pronged test that requires courts to scruti-\nnize both the procedure and substance of an IEP. See Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 206-07. The majority, however, prunes the second Rowley prong down\nto a stub.\n\n2 Brett's current level of educational performance should not be consid-\nered, as the majority indicates, supra at 21, to be his level of performance\nwhen he last attended school. The fact that Brett earned As and Bs when\nhe last attended school became irrelevant when he stopped attending\nschool altogether, for his educational performance then dropped to zero.\n\n                    30\n\f        [W]e felt that we could service [Brett] much better in resi-\n        dence, because we had a much higher percentage of a\n        chance of getting him into school, which is certainly where\n        you have to implement the IEP goals, and we found him\n        appropriate for our [residence program].\n\n        ...\n\n        I think that it becomes a matter of semantics of whether it's\n        an educational reason or a clinical reason [for residential\n        placement]. The bottom line when we look at a student at\n        RICA at pre-admission, if we're going to implement the\n        goals, especially the goals for a student who has serious\n        emotional disturbance, they have to be [in school]. That's\n        sort of the basic premise that they are going to be there,\n        otherwise they can't benefit from the program. .. .\n\n        And so basically a student with Brett's kind of profile is a\n        student we would say would need residence in order for the\n        RICA program to work, because you can't do therapy if the\n        student isn't in school either, because we don't do therapy\n        in the residential piece. So the student has to show up in\n        school.\n\n(J.A. 127, 140-41) (emphasis added). Richard Chorney, the executive\ndirector of the Grove School, testified that he agreed with Ms. Kelty's\nassessment of Brett's needs. In response to the question of whether\nBrett required a residential program in order to receive an appropriate\neducation, Mr. Chorney testified:\n\n        Yeah, I agree with the person who spoke from RICA that\n        [Brett] definitely needs a residential program. . . .\n        [Regarding] his need for residential placement, the environ-\n        ment can be carefully managed to encourage his compliance\n        with treatment or he can simply refuse to attend the school\n        and his family is in a power struggle on a daily basis. Also\n        a greater opportunity for students in residential placements\n        to bond with staff since they spend so much time together.\n        That's particularly true here. The people that put them to\n\n                    31\n\f        bed at night are the same people that wake them up in the\n        morning.\n\n(J.A. 237-38) (emphasis added). The district court also quoted from\na report from the Sheppard Pratt Psychiatric Hospital, which had\nexamined Brett:\n\n        Brett's avoidance of stressful experiences, his refusal to\n        attend outpatient psychotherapy and his noncompliance with\n        the medication prescribed by previous psychiatrists have\n        resulted in his failure to attend and learn in his current\n        school placement.\n\n(J.A. 469) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is difficult to see how the majority or district court can read this\ntestimony and fail to conclude that Brett needs a residential program\nin order to receive any educational benefit at all. Contrary to the\nmajority's characterization, see supra at 25, this evidence can hardly\nbe viewed as \"equivocal.\" Furthermore, the testimony of George\nMoore, another witness quoted by the majority, supra at 25, cannot\nbe interpreted as \"contradictory\" merely because he testified that resi-\ndential placement is both an educational and non-educational need.\nMoore plainly testified--consistently with the testimony quoted\nabove--that a residential placement was necessary \"[b]ecause [for]\nthe rest of the IEP to be implemented, [Brett] has to be in school.\"\n(J.A. 60).\n\nWe have held, as the majority recognizes, see supra at 26, that resi-\ndential care is required if it is \"essential for the child to make any edu-\ncational progress at all.\" Burke County Bd. of Educ. v. Denton, 895\nF.2d 973, 980 (4th Cir. 1990) (emphasis added). It is clear from the\ntestimony quoted above that a residential placement is essential to\nensure that Brett attends class. Common sense would indicate that\nBrett needs to attend class in order to make educational progress.\nErgo, residential placement is essential for Brett to make educational\nprogress.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 The majority considers such syllogistic reasoning employed by the\nALJ to be \"conclusory,\" \"not . . . well reasoned\" and, therefore, \"entitled\n\n                    32\n\fThe lack of residential placement for educational purposes is,\nalone, sufficiently serious to deny Brett a free appropriate public edu-\ncation. Unfortunately, there is more. The IEP also contains conflicting\nmethods for reaching its stated goals. For example, the IEP stated that\nBrett should learn how to convey information to an audience and how\nto write effectively. It is clear these goals were copied from earlier\nversions of Brett's IEP, as evidenced by the dates listed on the IEP's\nGoals and Objectives forms. Although the IEP stated that these goals\nwere to be met, in part, through assistance from the classroom\nteacher, the IEP elsewhere stated that Brett would spend his entire\nschool day with special education teachers, and no time with class-\nroom teachers. It is reasonably clear, therefore, that the August IEP\nmerely copied aspects from the earlier IEPs without fully updating the\ngoals and objectives to reflect Brett's current situation.4\n\nFinally, the IEP does not reconcile differences between its stated\ngoals and objectives on the one hand, and its recommendation for\nplacement at RICA on the other. The August IEP states--as did those\nfrom April and June--that several of Brett's goals should be accom-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nto little weight.\" Supra at 24-25. It is difficult to understand why it is\nwell reasoned to believe that Brett can make educational progress in a\nprogram he does not attend. Whatever the sources of Brett's emotional\nproblems and failure to attend school, see supra note 24 at 23-24, he\nneeded a residential placement \"to make any educational progress at all.\"\nDenton, 895 F.2d at 980. Contrary to the majority's assertion, the Yaders\nwere not seeking to have the school system fund\"the best possible place-\nment\" for Brett, see supra at 27; they were seeking a placement where\nBrett would attend class and therefore be able to make some educational\nprogress.\n\nIn addition, the majority mischaracterizes Denton to require that, in\norder to receive reimbursement for residential care, the student's emo-\ntional problems must be \"causally [ ]related to the learning process.\" See\nsupra note 24 at 23-24. Denton only requires that residential placement\nbe necessary, as is the case here, for the student to make any educational\nprogress at all. See Denton, 895 F.2d at 980.\n\n4 The point is not, as the majority believes it to be, supra at 21-22, that\nthe goals and methods were left unchanged in the August IEP. The point\nis that the IEP's goals and methods were not updated to reflect changes\nin Brett's situation after he went into crisis, and that the IEP called for\nwholly inconsistent methods of reaching those goals.\n\n                    33\n\fplished through Honors level accommodations. However, the IEP rec-\nommends placement at RICA, and RICA does not offer Honors level\nclasses. Placement at RICA therefore conflicts with the IEP's meth-\nods of attaining its goals.\n\nThe majority believes, as did the district court, that these deficien-\ncies could have been corrected after-the-fact.5 See supra at 22. How-\never, such an approach does not conform with the IDEA, its\nregulations, or the cases applying them. Educational services are to be\nprovided \"in conformity with the [IEP],\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(18)(D),\nand educational placement is to be \"based on[the] IEP,\" 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.552(a)(2). See also Spielberg v. Henrico County Pub. Schs.,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 This highlights yet another error in the majority's opinion, namely its\nholding that the district court properly reviewed the ALJ's decision under\nthe standard of review set forth in Rowley, 458 U.S. at 205-06, and Doyle\nv. Arlington County Sch. Bd., 953 F.2d 100, 105 (4th Cir. 1991).\n\nDistrict courts reviewing the decisions of state ALJs must make inde-\npendent decisions based upon a preponderance of the evidence, while\ngiving due weight to the ALJ's findings of fact. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at\n205-06. In fact, the ALJ's findings are entitled to be considered prima\nfacie correct. See Doyle, 953 F.2d at 105. If the district court chooses not\nto accept a finding of the ALJ, the district court must carefully explain\nwhy it does not. See id.\n\nFor the most part, the district court heeded the directives of Rowley\nand Doyle. The district court generally accepted the ALJ's findings and,\nfor most of the findings it rejected, gave reasoned explanations why it\nrejected those findings. There were, however, several glaring exceptions.\nThe district court rejected certain crucial findings about the sufficiency\nof Brett's IEP without giving any explanation why it rejected those find-\nings. The ALJ had found that the IEP (1) was internally inconsistent\nand/or contradictory; (2) had not been updated to reflect Brett's current\neducational and emotional performance; and (3) failed to include appro-\npriate criteria and evaluation procedures for measuring the goals con-\ntained in the IEP. These facts were significant in the ALJ's conclusion\nthat the IEP was defective. The district court, however, rejected these\nfindings, and the sum total of its \"analysis\" consisted of the following\ncursory phrase: \"Any minor deficiencies in the IEP in terms of describing\nBrett or setting objective criteria for goals could have been corrected.\"\n(J.A. 473). Such action did not accord the ALJ's findings of fact with the\nweight they were due, and thus constituted legal error.\n\n                    34\n\f853 F.2d 256, 259 (4th Cir. 1988) (holding that placement of the stu-\ndent, after which an IEP was developed to conform with the place-\nment, was a procedural violation sufficient to deny the student a free\nappropriate public education). Put another way, the IEP is to be the\nblueprint for an appropriate educational program, not a chronicle of\nwhat services were provided. Furthermore, when an IEP is defective\nbecause it inaccurately describes the student, incorrectly assesses his\nsituation, and inappropriately proposes certain treatment, then ser-\nvices conforming to, and the placement based upon, the implementa-\ntion of that IEP will also be defective. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1401(a)(18)(D); 34 C.F.R. § 300.552(a)(2).\n\nII\n\nIn conclusion, the deficiencies in Brett's IEP are serious and, in my\nopinion, those deficiencies deprived him of a free appropriate public\neducation. I would, therefore, grant the Yaders a reimbursement for\nthe costs of placing Brett in the Grove School for the 1996-97 school\nyear.\n\n                    35\n\f",

A state administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that Brett\nYader was denied a free appropriate public education pursuant to the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.A.\n§ 1400 et seq. (West 1990 & Supp. 1997), and granted the Yaders'\nrequest for reimbursement of the cost of Brett's residential placement\nat Grove for the 1996-1997 school year. The Board of Education of\nMontgomery County (the Board), filed suit against the Yaders in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland challenging\nthe ALJ's decision, and the district court reversed.\n\nWe agree with the district court that the Montgomery County Pub-\nlic School System (the school system) adequately complied with the\nprocedural requirements of the IDEA and that it provided Brett Yader\nwith an appropriate placement pursuant to the IDEA. We also con-\nclude that the district court did not err in applying this Circuit's stan-\ndard of review of state administrative decisions under the IDEA.\nThus, we affirm the district court's decision.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 The caption for the case in federal district court was originally styled\nBoard of Educ. of Montgomery County v. Brett Y., to protect the identity\nof the minor. The parties stated at oral argument, however, that they had\nno objection to the use of Brett's full name.\n\n                    2\n\fI.\n\nThe IDEA is a complex statute designed to provide free appropriate\neducational services to the more than eight million children with dis-\nabilities in the United States. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1400 (West Supp.\n1997). The IDEA amended the Education of the Handicapped Act, 20\nU.S.C.A. § 1401 et seq. (West 1990), which provided federal funds\nto state and local agencies to assist in the education of handicapped\nchildren, conditioning such funding upon the states' compliance with\nmandated goals and procedures.2\n\nThe IDEA, like its predecessor, requires that all children with dis-\nabilities be provided with a \"free appropriate public education\"\n(FAPE). 20 U.S.C.A. § 1400(c) (West Supp. 1997). FAPE is defined\nas special education and related services that: (1) are provided under\npublic supervision and at public expense without cost to parents; (2)\nmeet the standards of the state educational agency; (3) include an\nappropriate preschool, elementary, or secondary school education;\nand (4) are provided in conformity with the individualized education\nprogram required by § 1414(a)(5) of the Act. See 20 U.S.C.A.\n§ 1401(a)(18) (West 1990).\n\nTo receive funds from a state educational agency, local educational\nagencies and intermediate educational units must provide assurance\nthat they will develop an \"individualized education program\" (IEP)\nfor each child with a disability at the beginning of each school year\nand will review and, if appropriate, revise, the IEP's provisions peri-\nodically, but not less than annually. See 20 U.S.C.A. §§ 1401(a)(20),\n1414(a)(5) (West Supp. 1997). The IEP is a written statement devel-\noped through a meeting of a representative of the local educational\nagency, the child's teacher, the child's parent or guardian, and, when\nappropriate, the child. See 20 U.S.C.A.§ 1401(a)(20) (West Supp.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 The 1990 amendments substituted\"Individuals with Disabilities Edu-\ncation Act\" for \"Education of the Handicapped Act.\" See Pub. L. No.\n101-476, § 901(a)(1), 104 Stat. 1103, 1141-42 (1990), codified at 20\nU.S.C.A. § 1400(a) (West Supp. 1997). For ease of reference, we refer\nonly to the IDEA, even when discussing cases interpreting the Act prior\nto the 1990 amendments. See Gadsby v. Grasmick , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738514\"><a href=\"/opinion/738514/eric-gadsby-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-carol-gadsby-john-gadsby-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 942 n.1\n(4th Cir. 1997).\n\n                    3\n\f1997). The IEP must include: (1) a statement of the child's present\nlevels of educational performance; (2) a statement of annual goals,\nincluding short-term objectives; (3) a statement of the specific educa-\ntional services to be provided to the child and the extent to which the\nchild will participate in regular educational programs; (4) a statement\nof the needed transition services for students beginning no later than\nage 16 and annually thereafter; (5) the date for the initiation and dura-\ntion of the educational services; and (6) objective criteria and evalua-\ntion procedures and schedules for determining, at least annually,\nwhether the instructional objectives are being achieved. See id.\n\nThe IDEA also requires that prior written notice be given to the\nparents of a child whenever a local education agency or intermediate\neducational unit proposes to initiate or change the identification, eval-\nuation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a\nFAPE to the child. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(b)(1)(C) (West 1990). If\na complaint is made regarding any of these matters, the parents must\nbe provided an impartial due process hearing conducted by the state\neducational agency, local educational agency, or intermediate educa-\ntional unit, as determined by state law. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(b)(2)\n(West 1990).3\n\nMaryland law requires that a parent's request for a due process\nhearing be made through the Office of Administrative Hearings. See\nMd. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-413(c) (Michie 1997). The Office of\nAdministrative Hearings will then appoint an impartial ALJ to review\nthe child's education placement. See id. Within 180 days of the hear-\ning decision, any party may appeal to the United States District Court\nfor the District of Maryland or to the circuit court for the county in\nwhich the student resides. See id. at § 8-413(h).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 The federal regulations implementing the IDEA similarly provide that\na parent or a public educational agency may initiate an impartial due pro-\ncess hearing on any matters relating to the initiation or change in the\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the pro-\nvision of a FAPE to a child, or the refusal to initiate or change the identi-\nfication, evaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the provision\nof a FAPE to a child. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.504(a)(1) & (2), 300.506\n(1997).\n\n                    4\n\fThe IDEA requires that state educational agencies establish and\nmaintain procedures to ensure that children with disabilities and their\nparents are guaranteed procedural safeguards in the state agencies'\nprovision of a FAPE. See 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415 (West Supp. 1997). In\nkeeping with this requirement, Maryland has promulgated regulations\nimplementing its Education Article, Title 8, Subtitles 3 and 4, which\nguarantee a FAPE for all students with disabilities. See Md. Regs.\nCode tit. 13A, § 05.01 (1989).\n\nMaryland's implementing regulations require that an IEP must be\napproved by an Admission, Review, and Dismissal Committee (ARD\nCommittee). See Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A, § 05.01.08 (1991). The\nARD Committee is to be composed of a chairman designated by the\nlocal superintendent, individuals who are familiar with the student's\nfunctioning (including a special educator and interdisciplinary person-\nnel from the public agency and the local health department), and other\nappropriate persons, such as those expected to become deliverers of\ndirect service to the student. See Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,\n§ 05.01.08(A) (1991). An ARD Committee meeting must be open to\nthe child's parents, who shall be notified of the meeting at least 10\ndays in advance. See Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-405 (Michie 1997).\n\nII.\n\nBrett Yader is a severely emotionally disturbed high school stu-\ndent. He has been diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, anxi-\nety disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAlthough Brett has experienced emotional problems for which he has\nreceived therapy intermittently since the age of five, none of his emo-\ntional problems affected his education until he reached the eighth\ngrade.\n\nBrett attended the Montgomery County Public Schools in Mont-\ngomery County, Maryland, during the 1994-95 and 1995-96 school\nyears. In May of 1995, while attending Takoma Park Middle School,\nBrett was diagnosed with ADHD. In response, the school prepared an\naccommodation plan for Brett.\n\nIn the fall of 1995, Brett began ninth grade at Richard Montgomery\nHigh School. In October, Brett's accommodation plan was routinely\n\n                    5\n\freviewed, and he was performing well academically. Brett's atten-\ndance during the fall of 1995 declined, however. As a result, the\nschool system began a screening process on December 6, 1995, which\neventually led to an evaluation by the ARD Committee.\n\nOn January 17, 1996, the ARD Committee met to evaluate Brett.\nThe Committee determined that Brett was disabled and eligible for\nspecial education services. The Yaders attended this meeting. The\nARD Committee developed an IEP for the remainder of the 1995-96\nschool year. At the request of the Yaders, the IEP stated that Brett\nwas \"other health impaired\" rather than \"seriously emotionally\ndisturbed.\"4 (J.A. at 178.) The ARD Committee determined that Brett\nwould receive Intensity II5 special education services during the\nremainder of the 1995-96 school year at the Richard Montgomery\nHigh School.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 The federal regulations implementing the IDEA state that \"other\nhealth impairment\" means \"having limited strength, vitality or alertness,\ndue to chronic or acute health problems such as a heart condition, tuber-\nculosis, rheumatic fever, nephritis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, hemo-\nphilia, epilepsy, lead poisoning, leukemia, or diabetes that adversely\naffects a child's educational performance.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.7(b)(8)\n(1997).\n\nAccording to the regulations, \"serious emotional disturbance\" is\ndefined as:\n\n        a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteris-\n        tics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that\n        adversely affects a child's educational performance-- (A) An\n        inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sen-\n        sory, or health factors; (B) An inability to build or maintain satis-\n        factory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers; (C)\n        Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circum-\n        stances; (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depres-\n        sion; or (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears\n        associated with personal or school problems.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.7(b)(9) (1997).\n\n5 The Maryland regulations provide in part that Intensity II services\n\"may be considered appropriate for the student who may be appropri-\nately served by receiving service through the special education program,\nnot to exceed an average of 1 hour per school day.\" Md. Regs. Code tit.\n13A, § 05.01.10(E)(3) (1991).\n\n                    6\n\fThe IEP was reviewed after sixty days. The March 6, 1996, review\nindicated that Brett's attendance at school had \"greatly improved,\"\nand that he was performing well academically. Comments made by\nBrett's family, however, indicated that Brett \"was going into crisis at\nhome,\" (J.A. at 174), and that he possibly needed hospitalization.\n(J.A. at 175.) Although he was attending school regularly, Brett's\nbehavior at home was characterized by his parents as\"angry, border-\ning on violen[t].\" (J.A. at 290.)\n\nOn April 17, 1996, an ARD Committee meeting was held to con-\nduct a review of Brett's IEP. The ARD Committee concluded that\nBrett's academic performance had continued to improve in Intensity\nII placement. Brett attended Richard Montgomery High School for\nthe remainder of the 1995-96 school year. Brett's school attendance\nrapidly declined, however, near the end of the school year. On or\nabout June 10, 1996, Brett stopped attending school altogether. He\nslept all day, stayed up all night, and refused to leave his home or his\nbed. In response to this crisis, Brett's parents had him evaluated at the\nSheppard Pratt Psychiatric Hospital, but had to request police inter-\nvention to get Brett to attend the evaluation. Although after his evalu-\nation Brett was admitted to the American Day Treatment Center in\nChevy Chase, Maryland, for the most part he refused to attend the\nprogram.\n\nOn June 19, 1996, another ARD Committee meeting was con-\nvened. The IEP developed at this ARD meeting stated for the first\ntime that Brett was \"seriously emotionally disturbed.\" (J.A. at 177.)\nThe ARD Committee determined that Brett's needs could not be met\nin a general education program and recommended a therapeutic day\nschool.\n\nBrett's folder was forwarded to the Montgomery County Public\nSchools' central office for consideration of whether his special educa-\ntion services should be increased to Intensity V or VI,6 and, if so, for\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 The Maryland regulations define Intensity V services in part as \"ap-\npropriate for the student who requires a more intensive special education\nprogram than Intensities I-IV.\" Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,\n§ 05.01.10(E)(6) (1991). The regulations define Intensity VI services in\n\n                    7\n\fa determination of an appropriate placement for Brett.7 David Cross,\na placement specialist with the Montgomery County Public Schools,\nreceived Brett's file on approximately July 12, 1996.8 Mr. Cross testi-\nfied that he reviewed Brett's file the next day and determined that it\nneeded to be supplemented with an updated psychological evaluation.\nHe requested an evaluation from the school psychologist, Dr. Rene\nJohnson. Dr. Johnson made two attempts to obtain a psychological\nevaluation of Brett but was unable to do so because Brett would not\ncooperate. Mr. Cross then requested that a psychologist from the\nschool system's \"Rapid Response Team\" attempt to perform a psy-\nchological evaluation. That psychologist was also unsuccessful in\nobtaining an updated evaluation of Brett because Brett would not\nleave the house. After these unsuccessful attempts to obtain a further\npsychological evaluation of Brett, Mr. Cross scheduled a CARD\nCommittee meeting9 for August 26, 1996.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npart as \"appropriate for the student who requires special education pro-\ngramming and related services in a residential setting. This includes 24-\nhour special education and related services if determined by the Admis-\nsion, Review, and Dismissal Committee to be necessary to implement the\nstudent's individualized education program.\" Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,\n§ 05.01.10(E)(7) (1991).\n\n7 In the Montgomery County Public School System, if a student's spe-\ncial education needs cannot be met within his current school setting, the\nchild's file is referred to the central office for consideration whether the\nchild needs Intensity V or VI services. The file must be reviewed by a\nplacement specialist to determine whether it requires any additional\ninformation. Next, a Central Admission, Review, and Dismissal (CARD)\nCommittee meeting must be scheduled for an evaluation of the student\nand recommendation for appropriate services. As with an ARD Commit-\ntee meeting, the CARD Committee meeting must be open to the child's\nparents, who shall be notified of the meeting at least 10 days in advance.\n\n8 The ALJ found that \"[t]here is no dispute that the file was sent to the\ncentral offices on or before June 30, 1996 although no one was able to\ndocument the exact date.\" (J.A. at 315.) There is no explanation why Mr.\nCross, the placement specialist, did not receive the file until approxi-\nmately July 12.\n\n9 In the Montgomery County Public School System, if a student\nrequires Intensity V or VI services and his needs cannot be met within his\ncurrent school setting, a Central Admission, Review, and Dismissal\n(CARD) Committee meeting must be scheduled to evaluate the student\nand recommend appropriate services. See discussion ante, n.7.\n\n                    8\n\fMeanwhile, Mrs. Yader visited the educational and treatment facil-\nities at both the Regional Institute for Children and Adolescents\n(RICA) and Grove during the summer of 1996. On July 15, 1996, the\nYaders, through counsel, requested a due process hearing to review\nthe school system's identification, evaluation, or placement for spe-\ncial education services for Brett. Although Brett was accepted at\nGrove on or about July 17, 1996, the Yaders did not withdraw their\ndue process hearing request.\n\nDue to other student meetings, both counsel for the Yaders and Mr.\nCross were unavailable on August 26, 1996, so the CARD Committee\nmeeting was convened instead on August 30, 1996. At that meeting,\nBrett's IEP was modified to recommend that Brett be offered Inten-\nsity V services with a possible residential placement to address his\nnon-educational needs. Brett was given an interim placement at Rich-\nard Montgomery High School with Intensity III services.10 The\nCARD Committee referred Brett for an interview at RICA in Rock-\nville, Maryland, and told the Yaders that a place was being held for\nBrett at RICA for the 1996-97 school year.11 The Yaders' counsel\nmade clear that Brett would not attend RICA even if he were accepted\nafter the interview because the Yaders had already made plans for\nBrett to attend Grove. Nevertheless, Brett interviewed at RICA on\nSeptember 4, 1996, and was accepted into the residential program.\n\nThe Montgomery County Public School System's school year\nbegan on September 3, 1996. Counsel for the Yaders was notified of\nBrett's acceptance at RICA in writing by a letter dated September 10,\n1996. The Yaders were notified in writing by a letter dated September\n12, 1996, that Brett had been accepted at RICA for Intensity V special\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 The Maryland regulations provide that Intensity III services \"may be\nconsidered appropriate for the student who may be appropriately served\nby receiving special educational services not to exceed an average of 3\nhours per school day.\" Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A,§ 05.01.10(E)(4) (1991).\n\n11 RICA is jointly funded and operated by the State of Maryland's\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Montgomery County\nPublic Schools. The Montgomery County Public School System, how-\never, cannot make a placement at RICA, but can only refer a child to\nRICA for an interview. RICA then determines whether the child is an\nappropriate candidate and should be admitted to its program.\n\n                   9\n\feducation and enrollment in the residential program to address Brett's\nnon-educational needs. As stated earlier, however, Brett previously\nhad been enrolled at Grove and attended Grove for the entire duration\nof the 1996-97 school year.\n\nBecause the Yaders had requested a due process hearing on July\n15, 1996, the ALJ held hearings on October 1, 1996, and November\n1, 1996, to review Brett's placement. The ALJ issued a decision on\nDecember 16, 1996, finding that the school system had committed\nserious procedural violations of the IDEA, denying Brett a FAPE. The\nBoard appealed the ALJ's decision, and, after a bench trial, the dis-\ntrict court reversed. The Yaders now appeal, arguing that the district\ncourt failed to apply the proper standard of review, that the school\nsystem did not comply with the procedural requirements of the IDEA\nin the development of Brett's IEP, and that the school system's ulti-\nmate placement did not meet Brett's special education needs.\n\nIII.\n\nTo determine whether the Yaders are entitled to reimbursement for\nplacing Brett at Grove during the 1996-97 school year, we must deter-\nmine whether the August 30, 1996, IEP proposed by the CARD Com-\nmittee was appropriate.

While it would have\nbeen preferable for the district court to rely on this Court's precedent, the\ndistrict court did not apply the incorrect standard of review merely\nbecause it relied upon a district court case stating the same legal stan-\ndard.\n\n                    11\n\ffailure to develop and implement the IEP in a timely fashion caused\nBrett to lose educational opportunity. Second, the ALJ concluded that\ndeficiencies in the IEP caused Brett to lose educational opportunity.13\nIn considering whether the district court was correct in rejecting the\nALJ's findings, we keep in mind that the deferential standard\nannounced in Doyle also extends to the ALJ's findings regarding the\nBoard's compliance vel non with the procedural requirements of the\nIDEA. See Doyle, 953 F.2d at 106 n.6. We agree with the district\ncourt that any delay by the school system in convening a CARD\nCommittee meeting and any deficiencies in the IEP did not deny Brett\neducational opportunity.\n\n1.\n\nFirst, the ALJ found that the delay in convening the CARD Com-\nmittee meeting -- from June 19, 1996 to August 30, 1996 -- caused\nBrett to lose educational opportunity. The ALJ also found that \"there\nwas no IEP in effect at the start of the school year.\" (J.A. at 315.)\n\nThe ALJ stated, \"[w]hat is most troubling about the procedural his-\ntory in this case is the extended delay between the June 19, 1996\nARD meeting and the CARD meeting held on August 30, 1996.\"\n(J.A. at 315.) The district court agreed that \"it would have been pref-\nerable for [the school system] to act more expeditiously to finalize\nBrett's IEP and make a placement decision.\" (J.A. at 463.) The dis-\ntrict court concluded, however, that the timing of events was not so\negregious as to constitute a violation by the school system of Brett's\nprocedural rights provided under the IDEA.\n\nIn keeping with the deferential standard of review announced in\nDoyle, the district court gave reasons for rejecting the ALJ's finding.\nThe district court noted that after the June 19, 1996, ARD meeting,\nBrett's file was sent to the central placement office, where it arrived\non approximately July 12, 1996. Mr. Cross testified at the bench trial\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13 While the ALJ characterized these deficiencies as procedural, the dis-\ntrict court characterized them as substantive. Whether the alleged defi-\nciencies in the IEP are characterized as procedural or substantive,\nhowever, does not change our conclusion that Brett was not denied a\nFAPE.\n\n                    12\n\fthat it normally took a month to schedule a CARD Committee meet-\ning from the time the central placement office received the file, but,\nin this case, the first open date was approximately six weeks from the\ndate Brett's file was received, on August 26, 1996.14\n\nThe ALJ stated, \"I see nothing in either the federal or State regula-\ntions that entitles a public agency to do nothing because it's summer\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14 There is some confusion in the record and in the district court's opin-\nion about the school system's usual length of time for scheduling a\nCARD Committee meeting. We must only determine, however, whether\nthe district court properly held that the school system complied with the\nrequirements of the IDEA. The IDEA requires that the IEP must be\nestablished or revised \"at the beginning of each school year and [then\nreviewed] and, if appropriate, [revised], .. . periodically, but not less\nthan annually.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1414(a)(5) (West Supp. 1997); see also\nGadsby v.

Brett's IEP, which was origi-\nnally established on January 17, 1996, was reviewed after sixty days on\nMarch 6, 1996; reviewed again on April 17, 1996; reviewed and revised\non June 19, 1996, after Brett's behavior and performance had declined;\nand reviewed again on August 30, 1996, at the CARD Committee meet-\ning. Thus, Brett's IEP was reviewed four times within the year it was ini-\ntially developed and prior to the beginning of the school year. We\nconclude this was sufficient to meet the requirements of the IDEA.\n\nWe note that the Yaders requested at the June 19, 1996, ARD Commit-\ntee meeting that a CARD Committee meeting be convened as quickly as\npossible. We acknowledge that the IDEA emphasizes parental involve-\nment and that the school system could have acted more quickly to honor\nthe Yaders' request to have Brett's case expedited. Although the school\nsystem's handling of Brett's case was not a model of efficiency, the\nschool system has to deal with many cases. In short, although the school\nsystem could have acted more quickly, it did not violate the statute's\nrequirements.\n\n                    13\n\ftime.\" (J.A. at 318.). Contrary to the ALJ's assertion, the district court\ncorrectly noted that the Secretary of Education's interpretive guide-\nlines do recognize that time constraints may be relaxed during the\nsummer or a vacation period. The interpretive guidelines provide that\nan IEP must be implemented as soon as possible, except when the\nmeetings occur during the summer or a vacation period. See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.342(b) note (1997).15 Furthermore, as the district court found,\nthe school system was not \"doing nothing.\" It was attempting to\nobtain a psychological evaluation and then was moving forward to\nschedule the CARD Committee meeting. While we agree with the\ndistrict court that in hindsight it would have been ideal if the school\nsystem had treated this case as an emergency and acted immediately,\nthe statute and regulations do not require the school system to act\nmore expeditiously than it did.\n\nThe district court also rejected the ALJ's finding that there was no\nIEP in effect at the start of the school year. In accordance with Doyle,\nthe district court explained its rationale for finding that Brett's IEP\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15 The Secretary of Education has authority to issue rules and regula-\ntions to carry out the provisions of the IDEA.

We do not\nreach the question, however, of whether the interpretive guideline would\nremain consistent with the regulation in a situation where the school sys-\ntem is offering special education services during a summer school ses-\nsion.\n\n                     14\n\fwas \"in effect\" following the August 30, 1996, CARD Committee\nmeeting and that the IEP was timely implemented. While we adopt\na slightly different rationale from the district court, we agree that the\nIEP was developed and implemented at the beginning of the school\nyear in accordance with the requirements of the IDEA.\n\nTo determine what the IDEA requires for an IEP to be developed\nin a timely fashion, we begin by examining the language used in the\nstatute. See Shafer v. Preston Memorial Hosp. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736219\"><a href=\"/opinion/736219/deborah-shafer-v-preston-memorial-hospital-corporation-victoria-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n277 (4th Cir. 1997). \"When Congress does not expressly define a stat-\nutory term or phrase, a court should normally construe it in accord\nwith its ordinary or natural meaning.\" Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). \"In most cases, if the statutory language is plain and admits\nof no more than one meaning, the duty of interpretation does not\narise, and . . . the sole function of the courts is to enforce [the statute]\naccording to its terms.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (alter-\nation in original).\n\nWith these principles of statutory interpretation in mind, we con-\nsider the relevant statutory language. The IDEA conditions the receipt\nof federal funds upon the requirement that local educational agencies\nand intermediate educational agencies submit an application to the\nstate educational agency. According to the IDEA,\"[s]uch application\nshall . . . provide assurances that the local educational agency or inter-\nmediate educational unit will establish or revise, whichever is appro-\npriate, an individualized education program for each child with a\ndisability . . . at the beginning of each school year and will then\nreview and, if appropriate, revise, its provisions periodically, but not\nless than annually.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1414(a)(5) (West Supp. 1997). The\nMontgomery County school year began on September 3, 1996. There-\nfore, according to the plain meaning of the statute, Brett's IEP was\ntimely if \"established or revised\" prior to September 3, 1996. Because\nBrett's IEP, which was originally established on January 17, 1996,\nwas revised at the CARD Committee meeting on August 30, 1996, we\nconclude that it was developed in a timely fashion.\n\nThe ALJ concluded that Brett's IEP was not in effect at the start\nof the school year because Brett had only been provided the opportu-\nnity to interview at RICA and had not yet been formally accepted into\nRICA's residential program. The statute merely requires, however,\n\n                     15\n\fthat an IEP contain \"a statement of the specific educational services\nto be provided to [the] child.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1401(a)(20) (West Supp.\n1997). The IEP stated that Brett would receive Intensity V special\neducation services, with an interagency option for residential place-\nment. Thus, it did contain a statement of the services to be provided.\nBecause we conclude that this description of services met Brett's edu-\ncational needs,16 we conclude that, contrary to the ALJ's assertion, the\nIEP was properly in effect. Furthermore, Maryland's regulations\nallow thirty days for implementation of the IEP.17 See Md. Regs.\nCode tit. 13A, § 05.01.09(C) (1991). Thus, the school system had a\nshort period of time to implement the IEP, and RICA did accept Brett\ninto the residential program within thirty days.18\n\nIn concluding that Brett's IEP was timely, the district court relied\nupon both the Secretary of Education's federal regulations and inter-\npretive guidelines. The federal regulations provide:\n\n         (a) At the beginning of each school year, each public\n        agency shall have in effect an IEP for every child with a dis-\n        ability who is receiving special education from that agency.\n\n        (b) An IEP must--\n\n        (1) Be in effect before special education and\n       related services are provided to a child; and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16 See discussion post , at 20-24.\n\n17 See discussion post , at 17-19.\n\n18 As we noted ante, n. 11, RICA is jointly funded and operated by the\nState of Maryland's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the\nMontgomery County Public Schools. The Montgomery County Public\nSchool System cannot make a residential placement at RICA, but can\nonly refer a child to RICA for an interview. RICA then determines\nwhether the child is an appropriate candidate and should be admitted to\nits program. As counsel for the Board noted during oral argument, the\nschool system ultimately provided Brett with a placement that would\nallow therapeutic treatment during the day at RICA for Brett's educa-\ntional needs and a residential placement for Brett's non-educational\nneeds.\n\n                    16\n\f         (2) Be implemented as soon as possible follow-\n        ing the meetings under § 300.343.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.342 (1997) (emphasis added). In addition, the Secre-\ntary's interpretive guidelines provide that an IEP is considered \"in\neffect\" when the IEP (1) has been developed properly (at meetings\ninvolving all of the participants specified in the statute); (2) is\nregarded by both the parents and agency as appropriate with respect\nto the child's needs, goals and objectives, and services to be provided;\nand (3) will be implemented as written. See 34 C.F.R. pt. 300 app. C\n(question 3) (1997).\n\nThe district court, finding that all three requirements in appendix\nC, question 3, were met, concluded that the IEP was \"in effect\" as of\nAugust 30, 1996. First, the district court found that the IEP was devel-\noped properly at a meeting involving all of the participants specified\nin the statute, noting that Brett's parents attended the August 30,\n1996, CARD Committee meeting. Second, the district court con-\ncluded that Brett's parents regarded the IEP as appropriate with\nregard to Brett's needs, goals and objectives, and services to be pro-\nvided. Finally, the district court concluded that the school system\nsought to implement the IEP as written by arranging an interview for\nBrett at RICA. As the district court noted, the school system and the\nYaders knew that a place was being held for Brett at RICA. Finding\nthat all three requirements were met, the district court concluded that\nthe IEP was \"in effect\" prior to the beginning of the school year.\n\nWe question the district court's conclusion that the Yaders agreed\nthat the IEP was appropriate. First, the district court erred in finding\nthat the IEP was signed by Brett's parents.19 The ALJ correctly found\nthat neither the Yaders nor the CARD Committee chairman signed the\nIEP. Second, the Yaders' disagreement with the IEP and Brett's\nplacement is the fundamental dispute underlying this action.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 While the district court erred in finding that the IEP was signed by\nBrett's parents, the fact that the Yaders did not sign the IEP does not nec-\nessarily prevent the IEP from being \"in effect\" pursuant to the interpre-\ntive guidelines. The interpretive guidelines themselves state that parents\nare not required to sign IEPs. See 34 C.F.R. pt. 300 app. C (question 29)\n(1997).\n\n                    17\n\fWe need not dwell on whether the parents signed the IEP, whether\nthey agreed that it was appropriate, or whether the school system\ncomplied with the interpretive guideline because we believe that the\nsecond element of the interpretive guideline is inconsistent with the\nstatute. The second element of the guideline requires that, to be \"in\neffect,\" the IEP must be \"regarded by both the parents and agency as\nappropriate with respect to the child's needs, goals and objectives,\nand services to be provided.\" See 34 C.F.R. pt. 300 app. C (question\n3) (1997). In some cases, the parents, although involved in the process\nof developing the IEP, will ultimately disagree with the substantive\ncontent of the IEP. In such cases, the recourse available to parents is\nto request a due process hearing, see 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(b)(2) (West\n1990), and, if necessary, to unilaterally withdraw their child and place\nthe child in a different educational setting pending the resolution of\ntheir claim, see Burlington School Committee v.

If, as the interpretive guideline suggests,\nparents could simply refuse to agree with an IEP and thereby prevent\nthe IEP from being properly \"in effect,\" school boards could never\nfully comply with the IDEA's procedural requirements.20 We believe\nthis is not the practical effect the statute and regulations were\ndesigned to create.21 We agree with the district court that Brett's IEP\nwas properly in place at the beginning of the school year in compli-\nance with the IDEA. Because the Secretary's interpretive guideline is\ninconsistent with the statute, however, we rely, as we must, upon the\nstatute's plain meaning. See Kmart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20 The district court alludes to this inconsistency between the interpre-\ntive guideline and the statute but never fully discusses it.

We, therefore, conclude that the interpretive guide-\nline's provision that \"no delay is permissible\" in the implementation\nof the IEP is inconsistent with the federal regulations. Both the Secre-\ntary's federal regulation providing that the IEP must be implemented\n\"as soon as possible\" and the Maryland regulation's requirement that\n\n                    19\n\fthe IEP must be implemented within thirty days, however, are based\nupon permissible constructions of the statute.\n\nThe IEP was developed on August 30, 1996. The Yaders were\ninformed that Brett was accepted at RICA on September 12, 1996. As\nthe district court noted, \"Brett's IEP could have been implemented at\nRICA by the middle of September, well within the 30 school calendar\ndays that [the school system] had to implement the IEP without com-\nmitting a procedural violation.\" (J.A. at 461.) Thus, the district court\ndid not err in rejecting the ALJ's finding of fact that the implementa-\ntion of the IEP was untimely.\n\n2.\n\nSecond, the ALJ concluded that deficiencies in the IEP caused\nBrett to lose educational opportunity. Specifically, the ALJ found that\nthe school system's failure to include appropriate objective criteria\nand evaluation procedures for measuring goals, internal inconsisten-\ncies in the IEP, and failure to update the IEP to reflect the extent of\nBrett's disability and most recent educational performance were pro-\ncedurally deficient under the IDEA.22 Even assuming that these defi-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n22 Although the dissent finds fault with the substantive content of the\nIEP, it concedes that the school district complied with the procedural\nrequirements of the IDEA. See post at 29-30. It is well-settled that \"ade-\nquate compliance with the procedures prescribed . . . in most cases\nassure[s] much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substan-\ntive content in an IEP.\" See Board of Educ. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206\n(1982). We believe that this case is no exception.\n\nThe dissent apparently believes that the substantive content of the IEP\nwas inadequate despite the Board's compliance with the Act's procedural\nrequirements. The dissent cites the IEP's failure to acknowledge that\nBrett had gone into a \"crisis\" and refused to attend class altogether, its\nfailure to update goals and methods from previous IEPs, and the incon-\nsistency in its methods for reaching prescribed goals. When the IEP was\nrevised in June of 1995, however, Brett's complete refusal to attend class\nwas just surfacing. Moreover, between June and August, the school sys-\ntem could not get Brett to agree to an evaluation, so it had little new\ninformation upon which to rely in revising the IEP.\n\nWe agree with the ALJ and the district court that the IEP developed\non August 30, 1996, could have been improved. The school system is not\n\n                    20\n\fciencies in the IEP existed, we agree with the district court that none\nof the alleged deficiencies relied upon by the ALJ constituted a denial\nof a FAPE.\n\nTo support a finding that a student has not been provided with a\nFAPE, procedural violations must be serious and cause the student to\nlose educational opportunity. See Burke County Bd. of Educ. v.\nDenton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 982 (4th Cir. 1990) (finding school board's\nviolation of state and federal procedural notice requirements did not\ncause student to lose educational opportunity). The ALJ's primary\nconcerns about the procedural deficiencies in the IEP were that one\ngoal was unchanged from the April 1996 meeting (although the goal\nwas approved by Brett's parents as part of the IEP at the June 1996\nmeeting); at least two of the goals and objectives were unchanged\nsince the June 1996 meeting; Brett's educational performance was not\nmodified at the June or August meetings; the IEP failed to list the\nappropriate accommodations for a student recommended for a Inten-\nsity V; and the IEP neglected to list Brett's failure to attend class or\nschool. While we agree with both the ALJ and the district court that\nthe IEP developed on August 30, 1996, could have been improved,\nnone of these alleged procedural violations rises to a level indicating\nthat Brett lost educational opportunity.\n\nThat some goals were unchanged, in and of itself, is not significant.\nThe ALJ failed to articulate or specify how the goals had become out-\nmoded. In fact, the first goal listed on the IEP-- demonstrating\nacceptance of school routines by attending school on a regular basis\nand attending all classes on time -- clearly was a consistent, and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nrequired, however, to develop a perfect IEP. Instead, the proper standard\nis whether the IEP is \"reasonably calculated\" to confer educational bene-\nfit. See id. at 206-07. We agree with the First Circuit when it stated:\n\n        The IDEA does not promise perfect solutions to the vexing prob-\n        lems posed by the existence of learning disabilities in children\n        and adolescents. The Act sets more modest goals: it emphasizes\n        an appropriate, rather than an ideal, education; it requires an ade-\n        quate, rather than an optimal, IEP. Appropriateness and ade-\n        quacy are terms of moderation.\n\nLenn v. Portland Sch.

Furthermore, without a\nfurther psychological evaluation by the school psychologist, the\nschool system had little new information on Brett's condition with\nwhich to revise the IEP, except the evaluations of the Sheppard Pratt\nHospital and the American Day Treatment Center, which the CARD\nCommittee did consider. Because Brett had not been in school since\nJune 10, he had no new academic evaluations, and thus his educa-\ntional performance would not have been modified. In addition, his last\ngrades for the 1995-96 school year were based only upon the work\nhe completed, and he received all As and Bs. Cf. John Doe v. Defen-\ndant I, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538539\"><a href=\"/opinion/538539/john-doe-a-minor-by-and-through-his-parent-and-next-friend-mary-doe-v-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190 (6th Cir. 1990) (noting that student's\nmost recent grades were known by both his parents and school offi-\ncials). The district court concluded that \"[a]ny minor deficiencies in\nthe IEP in terms of describing Brett or setting objective criteria for\ngoals could have been corrected.\"23 (J.A. at 473.)\n\nFurthermore, the district court relied upon the Yaders' failure to\nchallenge any of the alleged deficiencies at the August 30, 1996,\nCARD Committee meeting when it concluded that the school system\ndid not deny Brett a FAPE. The district court noted that \"[n]owhere\ndid the Yaders challenge other aspects of the IEP as being sufficiently\ndeficient by themselves to constitute a denial of FAPE.\" (J.A. at 466.)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23 The dissent, relying upon Spielberg v. Henrico County Pub. Schs.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509556\"><a href=\"/opinion/509556/jonathan-spielberg-a-minor-by-his-parents-howard-and-susan-spielberg-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1988), argues that after-the-fact correction of an\nIEP does not conform with the IDEA. The dissent's reliance upon\nSpielberg, however, is misplaced. See post at 34-35. In Spielberg, the\nplacement decision was made before the IEP was developed. In Brett's\ncase, the IEP was developed at a meeting attended by the Yaders, as\nrequired by 20 U.S.C.A. § 1401(a)(20) (West Supp. 1998). The Yaders\nparticipated in the development of the IEP and had the opportunity to\nmake objections. Thus, the school system here, unlike the school system\nin Spielberg, complied with the procedural requirements of the IDEA.\n\nWhile we agree with the dissent that modifications may not be made\nto an IEP without scheduling a meeting and notifying the parents in com-\npliance with 20 U.S.C.A. § 1401(a)(20), if a school system has met the\nprocedural requirements of the IDEA, minor deficiencies in the IEP do\nnot necessarily deny a child a FAPE. As long as the IEP is \"reasonably\ncalculated\" to enable the child to receive educational benefit, the child\nhas not been denied a FAPE. See Board of Educ. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179-81 (1982).\n\n                    22\n\fInstead, the Yaders challenged only the issue of residential placement\nand timing of the placement.\n\nAlthough not cited by the district court, the testimony at the due\nprocess hearing and at the bench trial supports the district court's con-\nclusion. David Cross, placement specialist for the Montgomery\nCounty Public Schools, testified at the bench trial that everyone\nagreed to the specific goals and objectives discussed at the August 30,\n1996, CARD Committee meeting, and that neither the Yaders nor\ntheir counsel suggested that additional, specific goals needed to be\nadded. When asked whether she or her counsel had criticized the IEP\nat the August 30, 1996, meeting, Ms. Yader testified, \"I can't honestly\nsay.\" (J.A. at 162.) While the district court may have explained more\nfully why it rejected the ALJ's findings with respect to deficiencies\nin the IEP, we do not believe that the district court committed revers-\nible error under the Doyle standard. In conclusion, none of these\nalleged procedural deficiencies rose to the level of denying Brett edu-\ncational opportunity.\n\nB. Substance of IEP\n\nOnce we have determined that the state has complied with the\nIDEA's procedural requirements in developing and implementing the\nIEP, we turn to the second prong of the Rowley inquiry: whether the\nIEP is \"reasonably calculated\" to enable the child to receive educa-\ntional benefits.24 See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07. The CARD Com-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n24 The dissent is mistaken in its impression that we believe that compli-\nance with the IDEA's procedural requirements \"cures\" substantive defi-\nciencies in a child's IEP. See post at 30 n.1. We recognize, as our\nmajority opinion makes clear, that the Supreme Court's test in Rowley is\na two-pronged test. This Circuit has previously indicated, however, that\nthe second prong of the Rowley inquiry is more difficult to satisfy than\nthe first. See Tice v. Botetourt County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545164\"><a href=\"/opinion/545164/matthew-l-tice-a-minor-by-and-through-his-parents-connie-l-tice-kevin/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (4th\nCir. 1990). As we noted in Tice:\n\n        [T]he [Supreme] Court made clear in Rowley [that] once a proce-\n        durally proper IEP has been formulated, a reviewing court\n        should be reluctant indeed to second-guess the judgment of edu-\n        cation professionals. Neither the district court nor this court\n        should disturb an IEP simply because we disagree with its con-\n\n                    23\n\fmittee recommended Intensity V special education services, with an\n\"interagency option for [a] residential[placement],\" noting that Brett\nwas scheduled for an interview at RICA. (J.A. at 275.) In the mean-\ntime, Brett was given an interim placement of Intensity III services\nat Richard Montgomery High School. The interagency option for a\nresidential placement gave RICA the prerogative to enroll Brett as a\nresidential student upon its evaluation of Brett's needs.\n\nParents are entitled to reimbursement for their expenditures on pri-\nvate special education services \"if the court ultimately determines that\nsuch placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.\"\nBurlington, 471 U.S. at 369. Parents may place a child in a private\neducational institution if they disagree with the child's proposed IEP\nwithout waiving their right to potential reimbursement later, but they\ndo so at their own financial risk; they will be barred from obtaining\nreimbursement \"[i]f the courts ultimately determine that the IEP pro-\nposed by the school officials was appropriate.\" Id. at 374. The Yaders\nclaim that they are entitled to reimbursement for unilaterally placing\nBrett at Grove because the CARD Committee's Intensity V placement\nat RICA with an interagency option for residential services was inap-\npropriate to meet Brett's special education needs.\n\nWe have held that a residential placement that is necessary for\n\"medical, social, or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process\" need not be funded by the local education agency.\nDenton, 895 F.2d at 980. The ALJ made a conclusory determination\nthat Brett needed a residential placement for educational reasons, not-\ning under the \"Findings of Fact\" portion of her opinion that \"[Brett]\nneeds a residential placement in order to achieve educational benefit.\"\n(J.A. at 307.) Later, she stated, \"It is clear from the record, including\nthe testimony of Mr. Chorney and Ms. Kelty, as well as the reports\nfrom the American Day Treatment Program and Sheppard Pratt, that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n        tent. Rather, we must defer to educators' decisions as long as an\n        IEP provided the child \"the basic floor of opportunity that access\n        to special education and related services provides.\"\n\nId. (internal citation omitted) (quoting Board of Educ. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207-08 (1982)).

The ALJ, however, did not provide well rea-\nsoned explanations for her determination that Brett needed a residen-\ntial placement for educational reasons. Thus, her finding with respect\nto Brett's need for residential placement for educational reasons is\nentitled to little weight. See Doyle, 953 F.2d at 105 (noting that in\ndetermining what weight to give an administrative decision we should\nconsider the ALJ's methods in arriving at his decision). For example,\nthe ALJ relied in part on Ms. Kelty's testimony, but Ms. Kelty, the\nprincipal of RICA, testified that it is \"a matter of semantics of\nwhether it's an educational reason or a clinical reason.\" (J.A. at 140).\nSimilarly, although she relied in part on the testimony of Mr.\nChorney, the executive director of the Grove School, the ALJ did not\nexplain why she drew the conclusion from Mr. Chorney's testimony\nthat Brett needed a residential placement for educational needs. While\nMr. Chorney testified that Brett \"definitely needs a residential pro-\ngram,\" (J.A. at 237), he did not refer to any educational reasons for\na residential placement. Instead, Mr. Chorney discussed the opportu-\nnity a residential placement at the Grove School provided for students\nto \"bond with staff since they spend so much time together.\" (J.A. at\n237.)\n\nThe district court rejected the ALJ's finding, concluding that the\nCARD Committee's proposed placement was sufficient to meet\nBrett's special education needs. The district court found that Brett's\neducational needs were segregable from his non-educational needs.\nBased upon a preponderance of the evidence, we conclude that the\ndistrict court did not err in determining that Brett's educational needs\nwere segregable from his non-educational needs and that it was his\nnon-educational needs which necessitated a residential placement.\n\nThere was consistent testimony at the administrative due process\nhearing indicating that Brett needed a residential placement. The evi-\ndence was equivocal, however, as to whether such placement was\nnecessary for educational or non-educational needs. For example, the\ntestimony of Mr. George Moore, a placement specialist and CARD\nCommittee member, was contradictory. Mr. Moore testified that \"get-\nting a child to school\" was both a \"parent need\" and \"an educational\nneed.\" First, Mr. Moore testified that getting a child to school \"[is] a\nfamily or parent responsibility.\" (J.A. at 60.) Upon further question-\n\n                    25\n\fing, however, he testified that it was a \"special education need\"\nbecause regular school attendance was listed as a need on Brett's IEP.\n(J.A. at 60.) Mr. David Cross, a placement specialist employed with\nthe Montgomery County Public School System who attended the\nAugust 30 CARD Committee meeting, testified less equivocally. He\nstated that after an \"active discussion by the committee members\" at\nthe CARD Committee meeting, they concluded that \"intensity five\nservices were sufficient for school purposes\" and \"[t]hat the reason\nfor residential services was for other reasons\" including \"family con-\ncerns [and] concerns with school attendance and other mental health\nissues.\" (J.A. at 88.) Later, Mr. Cross did state that with regard to the\ndifficulty in getting Brett to school, it was a matter of \"interpretation\nwhether it's educational or family related.\" (J.A. at 99.)\n\nMany of the witnesses consistently testified, however, that Brett\nperformed well academically when he was at school and had few\ndisciplinary problems at school. Mr. Moore testified that when Brett\nwas at school, \"he didn't cause problems,\" \"he did his work,\" and \"he\ndid fine.\" (J.A. at 20.) Much of the testimony regarding Brett's need\nfor a residential placement focused upon his hostile and oppositional\nbehavior at home and his parents' inability to get him to attend\nschool. For example, Mrs. Yader testified that in March of 1996\nBrett's attendance at school and academic performance were greatly\nimproved, and yet his behavior at home was angry and bordering on\nviolent. Mrs. Yader also testified that \"[b]ehavorial problems at\nschool isn't [sic] Brett's problem\" and that Brett does not have behav-\nioral problems \"with [anyone] else in the whole world\" except his\nfamily. (J.A. at 163.)\n\nThis testimony, taken together, points to the conclusion that Brett\nfunctioned well when in an academic setting and that his primary con-\nflicts arose at home with his parents. Residential care is only required\nif the \"educational benefits which can be provided through residential\ncare are essential for the child to make any educational progress at\nall.\" Denton, 895 F.2d at 980. Accordingly, the district court held that\nthe CARD Committee's placement decision was appropriate, follow-\ning this Circuit's holding that a residential placement that is necessary\nfor \"medical, social, or emotional problems that are segregable from\nthe learning process\" need not be funded by the local education agency.25\nSee id.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n25 The dissent contends that the most serious flaw with Brett's IEP was\nits failure to require a residential placement. See post at 30. We disagree.\n\n                    26\n\fThe Yaders claim that Grove was a more appropriate placement for\nBrett than RICA because it offered honors classes, such as advanced\nmath and chemistry, that RICA did not offer. The IDEA does not\nrequire, however, that a school system fund the best possible place-\nment for a child. \"The [IDEA] requires only that the child be able to\nbenefit from the instruction that [he] receives, not that [he] be able to\nmaximize [his] potential commensurate with the opportunity provided\nnonhandicapped children.\" Id. We conclude that Brett could have\nmade educational progress at RICA, in a residential placement for\nnon-educational reasons.\n\nIn making a placement suggestion, the CARD Committee had to\nconsider its obligation to comply not only with the statutory provi-\nsions of the IDEA, but also with those of the Code of Maryland and\nMaryland's regulations implementing the IDEA. Although the Mary-\nland Code provides that \"[a] child who needs special education ser-\nvices that are not provided in a public county, regional, or State\nprogram shall be placed in an appropriate nonpublic educational pro-\ngram that offers these services,\" see Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-\n406(a)(1) (Michie 1997), the Maryland regulations provide, inter alia,\nthat a student with disabilities may be considered for nonpublic place-\nment only when the local school system or the state and local agen-\ncies, or both, cannot offer the appropriate special education and\nrequired related services, see Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A, § 05.01.12(B)\n(1991). The CARD Committee, in making a placement determination,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nAs the dissent correctly argues, residential care is required if necessary\nfor the child to make any educational progress at all. See Burke County\nBd. of Educ. v. Denton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 980 (4th Cir. 1990). A residential\nplacement that is necessary for medical, social, or emotional problems\nsegregable from the learning process itself, however, need not be funded\nby the local educational agency. See id. The reason for Brett's failure to\nattend school was defiance toward his parents. Such oppositional and\ndefiant behavior is an emotional problem causally unrelated to the learn-\ning process. As we have previously stated, testimony at the due process\nhearing indicated that Brett functioned well when at school and per-\nformed well academically. Based on this, we agree with the district\ncourt's determination that Brett suffered from an emotional problem that\nis segregable from the learning process. Therefore, we conclude that the\nschool system's placement was proper.\n\n                    27\n\fmust also place a child as geographically close to the child's home as\npossible. See 34 C.F.R. § 300.552(a)(3) (1997).\n\nBased upon the preponderance of the evidence, we agree with the\ndistrict court that the placement at RICA with an interagency option\nfor residential services was proper. We have noted that \"once a proce-\ndurally proper IEP has been formulated, a reviewing court should be\nreluctant indeed to second-guess the judgment of education profes-\nsionals.\" Tice v.

The district court, while acknowledging the find-\nings of the ALJ, adequately rebutted those findings before determin-\ning that the IEP was developed and implemented in a timely fashion\nat the beginning of the school year, that there were no serious proce-\ndural deficiencies that resulted in Brett's loss of educational opportu-\nnity, and that a residential placement to meet Brett's non-educational\nneeds was appropriate and complied with the IDEA. Accordingly, the\nYaders are not entitled to reimbursement for unilaterally placing Brett\nat Grove during the 1996-97 school year.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\nHAMILTON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nThe fundamental error in the majority's opinion is its holding that\nBrett's IEP was substantively sufficient to provide him with a free\nappropriate public education for the 1996-97 school year. See supra\nat 28. Because the IEP contains serious substantive defects that\ndenied Brett a free appropriate public education, the Yaders are enti-\ntled to reimbursement for enrolling Brett in the Grove School. I,\ntherefore, respectfully dissent.\n\n                    28\n\fI\n\nThe IDEA defines a \"free appropriate public education\" as special\neducation and related services that (1) are provided at public expense,\nunder public supervision and direction, and without charge; (2) meet\nthe standards of the State's educational agency; (3) include an appro-\npriate preschool, elementary or secondary school education in the\nState; and (4) are provided in conformity with the student's IEP. See\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(18). The IDEA requires that an IEP include, inter\nalia, (1) a statement of the student's present level of educational per-\nformance; (2) a statement of annual goals and short-term instructional\nobjectives; (3) a statement of specific educational services to be pro-\nvided to the student; and (4) appropriate objective criteria, evaluation\nprocedures and schedules for determining whether the instructional\nobjectives are being achieved. See 20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(20).\n\nThe IEP is intended to be the school district's \"blueprint\" for pro-\nviding a free appropriate public education to a disabled student. See\nSchool Comm. of Burlington, Mass. v. Department of Educ. of Mass.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111420\"><a href=\"/opinion/111420/burlington-school-comm-v-mass-dept-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368 (1985). Thus, it is logical to conclude that a pro-\ngram constructed on a faulty blueprint will itself be faulty. In other\nwords, when educational services are provided in conformity with an\nIEP that does not accurately reflect the student's circumstances or\nneeds, those educational services will neither address those circum-\nstances nor meet those needs.\n\nWe determine whether an IEP is appropriate and whether the\nschool district has fulfilled its obligations to provide a student with\na free appropriate public education by determining (1) whether the\nschool district has complied with the IDEA's procedural requirements\nwhen developing and implementing an IEP, and (2) whether the IEP\nis \"reasonably calculated\" to enable the child to receive educational\nbenefits. See Board of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v.\nRowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206-07 (1982). While I agree with the majority\nthat the school district complied with the procedural requirements of\nthe IDEA, see supra at 12-20, I disagree with the majority's implicit\nholding that the IEP accurately reflected Brett's circumstances and\nneeds, and was, therefore, reasonably calculated to provide him with\neducational benefits. My disagreement rests on the IEP's failure to (1)\ndocument the full extent of Brett's disability; (2) require a residential\n\n                    29\n\fplacement for educational purposes; (3) match its goals to its meth-\nods; and (4) reconcile its methods with placement at RICA.1\n\nOf these failures, the most obvious is the IEP's failure to note any-\nwhere that Brett had gone into \"crisis\" and refused entirely to attend\nclass. Without this information, the full extent of Brett's disability\ncould not be considered in developing a program that would provide\nhim with an adequate education. Furthermore, this omission caused\nthe IEP to misrepresent Brett's present level of educational perfor-\nmance. Since Brett refused to attend school, he was, perforce, making\nno educational progress.2\n\nThe omission of Brett's full disability at least contributed to--and\nperhaps caused--the IEP's most serious flaw, namely that the IEP\nfails to require a residential placement so that Brett can make educa-\ntional progress. Brett's refusal to attend classes should have been a\nsignificant factor in deciding whether a residential program was edu-\ncationally necessary. Since it was clear that a residential program\nwould be needed to get Brett to attend classes at all, then a fortiori\nit should have been clear that a residential program was educationally\nnecessary. The ALJ understood this, but the district court and major-\nity have failed to grasp or appreciate such logic. In concluding that\nBrett needed a residential placement--but for non-educational rea-\nsons only--the district court and the majority, see supra at 25-26,\nboth rely on the testimony of the parties' experts. The testimony both\ncited, however, does not support their conclusion. For example, Sherri\nKelty, the principal at RICA and one of the School Board's experts,\ntestified:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 I also disagree with the majority's apparent belief that complying with\nthe IDEA's procedural requirements somehow cures substantive defi-\nciencies in the IEP. See supra notes 22 and 23 at 20-21, 22. The Supreme\nCourt's test in Rowley is a two-pronged test that requires courts to scruti-\nnize both the procedure and substance of an IEP. See Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 206-07. The majority, however, prunes the second Rowley prong down\nto a stub.\n\n2 Brett's current level of educational performance should not be consid-\nered, as the majority indicates, supra at 21, to be his level of performance\nwhen he last attended school. The fact that Brett earned As and Bs when\nhe last attended school became irrelevant when he stopped attending\nschool altogether, for his educational performance then dropped to zero.\n\n                    30\n\f        [W]e felt that we could service [Brett] much better in resi-\n        dence, because we had a much higher percentage of a\n        chance of getting him into school, which is certainly where\n        you have to implement the IEP goals, and we found him\n        appropriate for our [residence program].\n\n        ...\n\n        I think that it becomes a matter of semantics of whether it's\n        an educational reason or a clinical reason [for residential\n        placement]. The bottom line when we look at a student at\n        RICA at pre-admission, if we're going to implement the\n        goals, especially the goals for a student who has serious\n        emotional disturbance, they have to be [in school]. That's\n        sort of the basic premise that they are going to be there,\n        otherwise they can't benefit from the program. .. .\n\n        And so basically a student with Brett's kind of profile is a\n        student we would say would need residence in order for the\n        RICA program to work, because you can't do therapy if the\n        student isn't in school either, because we don't do therapy\n        in the residential piece. So the student has to show up in\n        school.\n\n(J.A. 127, 140-41) (emphasis added). Richard Chorney, the executive\ndirector of the Grove School, testified that he agreed with Ms. Kelty's\nassessment of Brett's needs. In response to the question of whether\nBrett required a residential program in order to receive an appropriate\neducation, Mr. Chorney testified:\n\n        Yeah, I agree with the person who spoke from RICA that\n        [Brett] definitely needs a residential program. . . .\n        [Regarding] his need for residential placement, the environ-\n        ment can be carefully managed to encourage his compliance\n        with treatment or he can simply refuse to attend the school\n        and his family is in a power struggle on a daily basis. Also\n        a greater opportunity for students in residential placements\n        to bond with staff since they spend so much time together.\n        That's particularly true here. The people that put them to\n\n                    31\n\f        bed at night are the same people that wake them up in the\n        morning.\n\n(J.A. 237-38) (emphasis added). The district court also quoted from\na report from the Sheppard Pratt Psychiatric Hospital, which had\nexamined Brett:\n\n        Brett's avoidance of stressful experiences, his refusal to\n        attend outpatient psychotherapy and his noncompliance with\n        the medication prescribed by previous psychiatrists have\n        resulted in his failure to attend and learn in his current\n        school placement.\n\n(J.A. 469) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is difficult to see how the majority or district court can read this\ntestimony and fail to conclude that Brett needs a residential program\nin order to receive any educational benefit at all. Contrary to the\nmajority's characterization, see supra at 25, this evidence can hardly\nbe viewed as \"equivocal.\" Furthermore, the testimony of George\nMoore, another witness quoted by the majority, supra at 25, cannot\nbe interpreted as \"contradictory\" merely because he testified that resi-\ndential placement is both an educational and non-educational need.\nMoore plainly testified--consistently with the testimony quoted\nabove--that a residential placement was necessary \"[b]ecause [for]\nthe rest of the IEP to be implemented, [Brett] has to be in school.\"\n(J.A. 60).\n\nWe have held, as the majority recognizes, see supra at 26, that resi-\ndential care is required if it is \"essential for the child to make any edu-\ncational progress at all.\" Burke County Bd. of Educ. v. Denton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 980 (4th Cir. 1990) (emphasis added). It is clear from the\ntestimony quoted above that a residential placement is essential to\nensure that Brett attends class. Common sense would indicate that\nBrett needs to attend class in order to make educational progress.\nErgo, residential placement is essential for Brett to make educational\nprogress.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 The majority considers such syllogistic reasoning employed by the\nALJ to be \"conclusory,\" \"not . . . well reasoned\" and, therefore, \"entitled\n\n                    32\n\fThe lack of residential placement for educational purposes is,\nalone, sufficiently serious to deny Brett a free appropriate public edu-\ncation. Unfortunately, there is more. The IEP also contains conflicting\nmethods for reaching its stated goals. For example, the IEP stated that\nBrett should learn how to convey information to an audience and how\nto write effectively. It is clear these goals were copied from earlier\nversions of Brett's IEP, as evidenced by the dates listed on the IEP's\nGoals and Objectives forms. Although the IEP stated that these goals\nwere to be met, in part, through assistance from the classroom\nteacher, the IEP elsewhere stated that Brett would spend his entire\nschool day with special education teachers, and no time with class-\nroom teachers. It is reasonably clear, therefore, that the August IEP\nmerely copied aspects from the earlier IEPs without fully updating the\ngoals and objectives to reflect Brett's current situation.4\n\nFinally, the IEP does not reconcile differences between its stated\ngoals and objectives on the one hand, and its recommendation for\nplacement at RICA on the other. The August IEP states--as did those\nfrom April and June--that several of Brett's goals should be accom-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nto little weight.\" Supra at 24-25. It is difficult to understand why it is\nwell reasoned to believe that Brett can make educational progress in a\nprogram he does not attend. Whatever the sources of Brett's emotional\nproblems and failure to attend school, see supra note 24 at 23-24, he\nneeded a residential placement \"to make any educational progress at all.\"\nDenton, 895 F.2d at 980. Contrary to the majority's assertion, the Yaders\nwere not seeking to have the school system fund\"the best possible place-\nment\" for Brett, see supra at 27; they were seeking a placement where\nBrett would attend class and therefore be able to make some educational\nprogress.\n\nIn addition, the majority mischaracterizes Denton to require that, in\norder to receive reimbursement for residential care, the student's emo-\ntional problems must be \"causally [ ]related to the learning process.\" See\nsupra note 24 at 23-24. Denton only requires that residential placement\nbe necessary, as is the case here, for the student to make any educational\nprogress at all. See Denton, 895 F.2d at 980.\n\n4 The point is not, as the majority believes it to be, supra at 21-22, that\nthe goals and methods were left unchanged in the August IEP. The point\nis that the IEP's goals and methods were not updated to reflect changes\nin Brett's situation after he went into crisis, and that the IEP called for\nwholly inconsistent methods of reaching those goals.\n\n                    33\n\fplished through Honors level accommodations. However, the IEP rec-\nommends placement at RICA, and RICA does not offer Honors level\nclasses. Placement at RICA therefore conflicts with the IEP's meth-\nods of attaining its goals.\n\nThe majority believes, as did the district court, that these deficien-\ncies could have been corrected after-the-fact.5 See supra at 22. How-\never, such an approach does not conform with the IDEA, its\nregulations, or the cases applying them. Educational services are to be\nprovided \"in conformity with the [IEP],\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(18)(D),\nand educational placement is to be \"based on[the] IEP,\" 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.552(a)(2). See also Spielberg v. Henrico County Pub. Schs.,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 This highlights yet another error in the majority's opinion, namely its\nholding that the district court properly reviewed the ALJ's decision under\nthe standard of review set forth in Rowley, 458 U.S. at 205-06, and Doyle\nv. Arlington County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575224\"><a href=\"/opinion/575224/mairin-doyle-brian-doyle-margaret-doyle-v-arlington-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (4th Cir. 1991).\n\nDistrict courts reviewing the decisions of state ALJs must make inde-\npendent decisions based upon a preponderance of the evidence, while\ngiving due weight to the ALJ's findings of fact. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at\n205-06. In fact, the ALJ's findings are entitled to be considered prima\nfacie correct. See Doyle, 953 F.2d at 105. If the district court chooses not\nto accept a finding of the ALJ, the district court must carefully explain\nwhy it does not. See id.\n\nFor the most part, the district court heeded the directives of Rowley\nand Doyle. The district court generally accepted the ALJ's findings and,\nfor most of the findings it rejected, gave reasoned explanations why it\nrejected those findings. There were, however, several glaring exceptions.\nThe district court rejected certain crucial findings about the sufficiency\nof Brett's IEP without giving any explanation why it rejected those find-\nings. The ALJ had found that the IEP (1) was internally inconsistent\nand/or contradictory; (2) had not been updated to reflect Brett's current\neducational and emotional performance; and (3) failed to include appro-\npriate criteria and evaluation procedures for measuring the goals con-\ntained in the IEP. These facts were significant in the ALJ's conclusion\nthat the IEP was defective. The district court, however, rejected these\nfindings, and the sum total of its \"analysis\" consisted of the following\ncursory phrase: \"Any minor deficiencies in the IEP in terms of describing\nBrett or setting objective criteria for goals could have been corrected.\"\n(J.A. 473). Such action did not accord the ALJ's findings of fact with the\nweight they were due, and thus constituted legal error.\n\n                    34\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509556\"><a href=\"/opinion/509556/jonathan-spielberg-a-minor-by-his-parents-howard-and-susan-spielberg-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259 (4th Cir. 1988) (holding that placement of the stu-\ndent, after which an IEP was developed to conform with the place-\nment, was a procedural violation sufficient to deny the student a free\nappropriate public education). Put another way, the IEP is to be the\nblueprint for an appropriate educational program, not a chronicle of\nwhat services were provided. Furthermore, when an IEP is defective\nbecause it inaccurately describes the student, incorrectly assesses his\nsituation, and inappropriately proposes certain treatment, then ser-\nvices conforming to, and the placement based upon, the implementa-\ntion of that IEP will also be defective. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1401(a)(18)(D); 34 C.F.R. § 300.552(a)(2).\n\nII\n\nIn conclusion, the deficiencies in Brett's IEP are serious and, in my\nopinion, those deficiencies deprived him of a free appropriate public\neducation. I would, therefore, grant the Yaders a reimbursement for\nthe costs of placing Brett in the Grove School for the 1996-97 school\nyear.\n\n                    35\n\f</pre>",
