SS 3604 and 3617, and the\nPennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. S 955. The\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment was based on\nits conclusion that the FHC lacked standing under Article\nIII of the United States Constitution to maintain this suit.\nBecause we are convinced by the unique set of facts\nsurrounding the section 3604(c) claims that the FHC has\nfailed to satisfy the \"injury in fact\" requirement embodied in\nArticle III, we find that the grant of summary judgment as\nto those claims was appropriate. As to the section 3617\nretaliation claims, however, we find that the FHC has raised\nissues of fact sufficient to withstand Montgomery's motion\nfor summary judgment. We will, therefore, reverse the\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment as to the\nretaliation claim and remand for further consideration.\n\nI.\n\nThe FHC, a fair housing group which has operated in the\nPhiladelphia area for more than forty years, defines itself as\na non-profit organization whose \"purpose is to educate and\npromote fair housing and to oppose segregation based on\nthe protected classes found in the Fair Housing Act of\n1968, as amended.\" On April 6, 1994, the FHCfiled a\ncomplaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission (\"PHRC\") and HUD alleging that from\nNovember 24, 1993 forward, Montgomery \"accepted and\npublished advertisements that were discriminatory based\non gender and familial status\" in violation of state and\nfederal law. The complaint included copies of six\nadvertisements which appeared in Montgomery newspapers\nbetween November, 1993 and March, 1994. Each of these\n\n                               3\n\fadvertisements contained one of the following allegedly\nobjectionable phrases: \"mature person\"; \"ideal for quiet and\nreserved single and-or couple\"; \"professional male . . . only\";\nand \"quiet mature setting.\" On January 5, 1996, the PHRC\nnotified the FHC that \"investigation of the complaint [had]\nresulted in a Finding of Probable Cause. . . .\"\n\nAccording to the FHC, Montgomery \"continued publishing\ndiscriminatory speech.\" Therefore on February 21, 1996,\nthe FHC filed suit in district court. An amended complaint\nwas filed on April 10, 1996. In the amended complaint, the\nFHC alleged that Montgomery's acceptance and publication\nof discriminatory housing advertisements frustrated the\norganization's mission and resulted in damage to the\norganization caused by the need to divert resources to fight\nthe discrimination. The FHC also alleged that as a result of\nthe discriminatory advertisements, \"families with children\nwere barred from housing\" in violation of state and federal\nlaw.\n\nThe amended complaint added allegations that\nMontgomery had intimidated, coerced, interfered with and\nretaliated against the FHC as a result of the FHC's\ncomplaint against Montgomery. The FHC contended that in\nnewspaper articles, testimony before the state legislature,\nand other false statements made by or on behalf of\nMontgomery, the FHC had been placed in a position of\nridicule which impaired the organization's effectiveness.\n\nOn September 25, 1996, Montgomery filed a motion for\nsummary judgment which was granted on January 6,\n1997. The district court held that the FHC lacked standing\nto pursue any of the claims alleged.\n\nIn arriving at this conclusion the district court separated\nthe FHC's damage claims into three categories: (1)\nfrustration of the FHC mission; (2) diversion of resources to\nmeasures designed to correct the harm caused by the\ndiscriminatory advertising; and (3) diversion of resources to\nlitigation.\n\nAnalyzing the first category of claims, the court found\nthat frustration of an organization's mission can never, as\na matter of law, suffice to satisfy the Article III requirement\nof injury in fact. With respect to the alleged diversion of\n\n                                4\n\fresources to programs designed to counteract the\ndiscrimination, the district court found that the FHC \"failed\nto set forth specific evidence demonstrating that its various\nprograms have been `perceptibly impaired as a result of the\ndiversion of its resources . . . to activities counteracting\n[the] allegedly discriminatory acts.' [P]laintiff has failed . . .\nto initiate any such educational program or to expend any\nfunds at all on the development of such a program.\" Fair\nHousing Council v. Montgomery Newspapers, 1997 WL 5185\n*7 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 7, 1997).\n\nThe court also rejected the FHC's argument that it had\nsuffered injury for purposes of Article III when it was forced\nto divert resources from other programs to the pursuit of\nlitigation. \"[S]uch an injury cannot constitute, as a matter\nof law, an injury in fact.\" Id. at *6. The court reasoned that\nfinding this type of injury sufficient would mean that an\norganization would be able to \"manufacture the injury\nnecessary to maintain a suit from its expenditure of\nresources on that very suit.\" Id. at *5 (quoting Spann v.\nColonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\nII.\n\nIn order to place the district court's holding and our\nreview of that holding in context, we turn first to the law\ngoverning standing in general. Constitutional standing\nrequirements have been articulated often. The Supreme\nCourt summarized the history and parameters of those\nrequirements most recently in Raines v. Byrd, ___ U.S. ___,\n117 S. Ct. 2312 (1997). Article III S 2 of the Constitution\nconfers jurisdiction in the federal courts over\"cases\" and\n\"controversies.\" \"One element of the case or controversy\nrequirement is that [the plaintiffs], based on their\ncomplaint, must establish that they have standing to sue.\nThe standing inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff is the\nproper party to bring this suit.\" Id. at 2317 (citation\nomitted).\n\nThe standing inquiry in most cases is two-tiered,\ninvolving \"both constitutional limitations on federal-court\njurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.\"\n\n                               5\n\fWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). First, a plaintiff\nmust satisfy the \"case\" or \"controversy\" requirement of\nArticle III. This requirement has been described as\n\"immutable\", Bennett v. Spear, ___ U.S. ___, 117 S. Ct.\n1154, 1163 (1997) and as the \"irreducible constitutional\nminimum.\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n560 (1992). The standing requirements embodied in the\n\"case\" or \"controversy\" provision of Article III mean that in\nevery case, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate:\n\n       An \"injury in fact\" -- an invasion of a judicially\n       cognizable interest which is (a) concrete and\n       particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not\n       conjectural or hypothetical; second, there be a causal\n       connection between the injury and the conduct\n       complained of -- the injury has to be \"fairly trace[able]\n       to the challenged action of the defendant, and not .. .\n       the result [of] the independent action of some third\n       party not before the court. Third, it must be \"likely,\" as\n       opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the injury will be\n       \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n\nId. at 560-61. Each of these elements of Article III standing\n\"must be supported in the same way as any other matter\non which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with\nthe manner and degree of evidence required at the\nsuccessive stages of the litigation.\" Bennett v. Spear, at\n1163-64 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561).\n\nEven where this constitutional minimum has been met,\ncourts have developed other standing principles which may\nbe invoked to defeat a plaintiff's standing to pursue a\nclaim.\n\n       In addition to the immutable requirements of Article III,\n       \"the federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of\n       prudential principles that bear on the issue of\n       standing.\" Like their constitutional counterparts, these\n       \"judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal\n       jurisdiction\" are \"founded in concern about the proper\n       -- and properly limited -- role of the courts in a\n       democratic society\" but unlike their constitutional\n       counterparts, they can be modified or abrogated by\n       Congress.\n\n                               6\n\fId. at 1161 (citations omitted). These second-tier prudential\nlimits on standing deal with who is authorized to invoke the\ncourts' decisional and remedial powers. The Supreme Court\nin Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499-500 (1975),\nsummarized these prudential limits as follows:\n\n       Apart from [the] minimum constitutional mandate, this\n       court has recognized other limits . . . . First, the Court\n       has held that when the asserted harm is a \"generalized\n       grievance\" shared in substantially equal measure by all\n       or a large class of citizens, that harm alone does not\n       warrant exercise of jurisdiction. Second, even when the\n       plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to meet the \"case\n       or controversy\" requirements, this Court has held that\n       the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights\n       and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the\n       legal rights or interests of other parties. Without such\n       limitations\n       . . . the courts would be called upon to decide abstract\n       questions of wide public significance even though other\n       governmental institutions may be more competent . . .\n       and judicial intervention may be unnecessary to\n       protect individual rights.\n\n(Citations omitted.)\n\nCongress may grant an express right of action to those\nwho would otherwise lack standing due to application of\nthe prudential requirements. So long as the Article III\nminimum requirements are met, a plaintiff may, where\nCongress directs, have standing to \"seek relief on the basis\nof the legal rights and interests of others, and . .. may\ninvoke the general public interest. . . .\" Id. at 500.\nPrudential standing requirements have been eliminated in\ncases arising under the Fair Housing Act (\"the Act\").1 The\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. 642 U.S.C. S 3604(c) of the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful:\n\n       To make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or\n       published any notice, statement, or advertisement with respect to\n       the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference,\n       limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,\n       handicap, familial status, or national origin or an intention to\nmake\n       any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.\n\n                               7\n\fSupreme Court has established that Congress intended\nthat standing under the Fair Housing Act be limited only by\nArticle III and that the courts, as a result, may not create\nprudential barriers to standing under the Act. \"[T]he sole\nrequirement for standing to sue [under the Fair Housing\nAct] is the Art. III minima [sic] of injury in fact: that the\nplaintiff allege that as a result of the defendant's actions he\nhas suffered `a distinct and palpable injury.' \" Havens\nRealty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 372 (1982)\n(citations omitted).\n\nIII.\n\nIn this matter we must decide whether the FHC has\nshown \"distinct and palpable injury\" sufficient to satisfy\nArticle III standing requirements under the Fair Housing\nAct. The parameters of the injury requirement were\naddressed by the Supreme Court in Havens Realty Corp. v.\nColeman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982). In Havens, a realty company\nand one of its employees were alleged to have engaged in\nracial \"steering\" in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The\nplaintiffs included a housing organization, Housing\nOpportunities Made Equal (\"HOME\"), which had a mission\ngenerally similar to that of the FHC here. HOME alleged\nthat it had suffered injury as a result of the \"steering,\"\nclaiming that its counseling and referral services had been\nfrustrated with a consequent drain on its resources. The\ncomplaint also contained allegations that individual\nplaintiffs had been \"deprived . . . of the . . . benefits of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Act provides that \"an aggrieved person may commence a civil action\nin an appropriate United States district court. . . .\", S 3613(a)(1)(A),\nand\ndefines an \"aggrieved person\" (including corporations and associations)\nas:\n\n       any person who--\n       (1) claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing\npractice;\n       or\n       (2) believes that such person will be injured by a discriminatory\n       housing practice that is about to occur.\n\nSection 3602(I).\n\n                               8\n\finterracial   associations that arise from living in integrated\ncommunities   free from discriminatory housing practices.\"\nId. at 369.   The Supreme Court held that HOME was\nentitled to   sue in its own right.\n\nAfter explaining that standing under the Fair Housing Act\nis constrained only by Article III requirements and outlining\nthose requirements, the Court wrote:\n\n       In determining whether HOME has standing under the\n       Fair Housing Act, we conduct the same inquiry as in\n       the case of an individual: Has the plaintiff \" `alleged\n       such a personal stake in the outcome of the\n       controversy' as to warrant his invocation of federal\n       court jurisdiction?\" . . . If, as broadly alleged,\n       petitioner's . . . practices have perceptibly impaired\n       HOME's ability to provide counseling and referral\n       services for low- and moderate-income homeseekers,\n       there can be no question that the organization has\n       suffered injury in fact. Such concrete and demonstrable\n       injury to the organization's activities -- with the\n       consequent drain on the organization's resources--\n       constitutes far more than simply a setback to the\n       organization's abstract social interests.\n\nId. 455 U.S. at 378-79 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nBefore we analyze the FHC's particular allegations of\nharm, we note that there is a critical distinction between\nHavens and this case. In Havens, the plaintiff 's damage\nallegations were examined in the context of a motion to\ndismiss. Here, however, the issue of standing was before\nthe district court on a motion for summary judgment. While\nthere is no dispute that the FHC's damage allegations2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. In its amended complaint the FHC made the following allegations\nbearing on injury:\n\n       10. [E]ach act of discrimination conducted in the Delaware Valley\n       causes a setback to the good work accomplished by the FHC's\n       educational outreach efforts and to the development of an\nintegrated\n       housing community. As a result, the FHC must launch further\n       efforts to undo the damage that the discrimination has caused . . .\n.\n       The further efforts required are a substantial drain on its\nresources\n       and harms [sic] the FHC.\n\n                                 9\n\ftrack the language in Havens and were sufficient to\nwithstand a motion to dismiss, something more than these\nnaked allegations was required at the summary judgment\nstage. \"Since [the elements of standing] are not mere\npleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of\nthe plaintiff's case, each element must be supported in the\nsame way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears\nthe burden of proof, i.e. with the manner and degree of\nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\"\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\n\nIn order to defeat the summary judgment motion based\non the issue of standing, the FHC was required to submit\n\"affidavits or other evidence showing through specific facts\n. . . that . . . it [was] `directly' affected [by the alleged\ndiscrimination].\" Id. at 562 (emphasis added). According to\nthe district court, the FHC failed to carry its burden at\nsummary judgment, producing nothing of substance to\nsupport the mere allegations set forth in the complaint. As\nto the discrimination claims, we agree.\n\nIV.\n\nBecause both the FHC and the district court considered\nby category the damage claims based on alleged\ndiscrimination, we do the same, turning first to the\nallegations regarding frustration of mission. In an effort to\nestablish standing, the FHC argued that the discriminatory\nadvertisements \"cause[d] a setback to the good work\naccomplished by the FHC's educational outreach efforts\nand to the development of an integrated housing\ncommunity.\" The district court rejected this alleged\n\"frustration of mission\" as a basis for organizational\nstanding, stating that \"such an injury cannot constitute, as\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       20. As a result of the conduct of the Defendants, persons were\n       injured in their person and property. Specifically, families with\n       children were barred from housing in violation of the . . . Act of\n       1968 . . . . Further, the FHC is now forced to divert funds to\n       counteract the discriminatory message and acts of Defendants and\n       has had its purpose frustrated by Defendants' discriminatory\n       conduct.\n\n                               10\n\fa matter of law, an `injury in fact.' \" Fair Housing Council,\n1997 WL 5185 at *4. This is not an accurate statement of\nthe law. Havens made clear that where discriminatory\n\"practices have perceptibly impaired [an organization's\nability to carry out its mission], there can be no question\nthat the organization has suffered injury in fact.\" 455 U.S.\nat 379. Nonetheless, we are convinced that the allegations\nof frustration of mission were insufficient to defeat\nsummary judgment as the FHC failed to substantiate any\nperceptible impairment to its mission.\n\nThe FHC contends that its mission suffered the\nimpairment required to establish standing when it was\nforced to divert resources from counseling and other\nactivities to: (1) an educational campaign designed to\ncounteract the discriminatory effect of the advertisements;\n(2) an investigation designed to determine the existence and\nextent of on-going discrimination in advertising; and (3)\nlitigation. We address the FHC's alleged diversion of\nresources in each of these categories seriatim.\n\nA.\n\nWe turn first to the FHC's claim that it was damaged by\nthe need to divert funds \"over the course of three years to\nrepair damage caused by\" the discriminatory\nadvertisements. Although pressed to do so in discovery and\nin oral argument before us, the FHC was unable to\nestablish any connection between the allegedly\ndiscriminatory advertisements underlying this suit and the\nneed for or implementation of a remedial educational\ncampaign. The FHC was unable to verify that any member\nof the public had been denied housing or was deterred from\nseeking housing based on the advertisements. The FHC was\nalso unable to establish that any member of the public\ncomplained about the contents of the advertisements or\nformed a misimpression about the legality of their contents.\nIn fact, the FHC was unable to show that anyone other\nthan the FHC staff even read the relevant advertisements.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. We do not, as the dissent argues, impose a bona-fide home-seeker\nrequirement. We adhere instead to the letter of the caselaw which clearly\n\n                               11\n\fNot only did the FHC fail to introduce evidence of the need\nfor an educational program, it failed to show that any\neducational effort was ever implemented.\n\nThe only evidence relating to implementation of an\neducational effort was the FHC's allegation that, at some\nfuture time, it would be required to spend almost $100,000\nin newspaper advertising and over $300,000 in seminars\nand mailings to reach consumers to counter the\nadvertisements' discriminatory message. Although the\nquestionable advertisements were published in 1993 and\n1994, the FHC admitted that it has yet to undertake any\neducational countermeasures or to offer counseling directed\nat reversing the damage alleged to have been caused by the\nadvertisements. The FHC was unable to say when such\nmeasures might be undertaken or when funds might\nactually be expended in support of this educational effort.\nThese inchoate plans for future programs are insufficient to\ndemonstrate injury for purposes of Article III:\n\n       Such \"some day\" intentions -- without any description\n       of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of\n       when the some day will be -- do not support afinding\n       of the \"actual or imminent\" injury that our cases\n       require.\n\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 564.4 The FHC's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nestablishes that an alleged injury must be shown to flow from the\nconduct alleged. Where, as here, the record fails to show that any\nhousing provider, real estate professional, or member of the public ever\nsaw the advertisements specified, the essential causal nexus between the\nadvertisements and the injury alleged is missing. Contrary to what the\ndissent suggests, the injury alleged must result from the particular\ndiscriminatory acts, not from the general conduct of multiple parties over\nthe course of years.\n\n4. While the dissent argues that \"the cases are legion supporting a\nconclusion that the FHC is not required to actually pay for the\nadvertising campaign before it can assert standing,\" the cases cited\ndiffer\nfundamentally from this one in that they address circumstances where\nan injury is threatened. These cases hold that where the threat of injury\nis real, a plaintiff will not be denied standing. Here, however, injury is\nalleged to have already occurred. The FHC argues that it suffered injury\n\n                               12\n\ffailure to document the need for corrective education\nengendered by the advertisements cited, coupled with the\nfact that it has yet to devote any of its resources to pursuit\nof an educational campaign, undermines its claim to have\nsuffered actual injury. The record is devoid of evidence that\nthe FHC was required to modify any of its services in\nresponse to the objectionable advertisements.\n\nB.\n\nThe FHC's claim that it suffered palpable injury when it\nwas forced to divert resources to investigation also fails for\nlack of proof. The \"investigation\" to which the FHC refers\nconsisted of having its staff members review classified\nadvertisements placed in Montgomery and other suburban\nPhiladelphia newspapers on an ongoing basis for evidence\nof discrimination. This investigation is alleged to have\nnecessitated a diversion of staff resources which could have\nbeen directed to counseling and other organizational\nfunctions. The record fails, however, to establish any\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwhen it diverted resources to an education campaign. Yet, in the more\nthan three years following publication of the relevant advertisements, the\nFHC has failed to implement the campaign.\n\nThe dissent's reliance on Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHousing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 261 (1997), to support standing based\non plans alone is also misplaced. In Arlington Heights, a housing\norganization generated blueprints and building plans in preparation for\nthe construction of low-income housing. These plans were thwarted by\nthe defendant's denial of a zoning request. The Supreme Court held that\nwhere \"the challenged action [stood] as an absolute barrier to\nconstructing the housing that [the plaintiff] contracted to place on the\nsite\" and the planned project was \"detailed and specific,\" the \"court\n[was]\nnot required to engage in undue speculation as a predicate for finding\nthat the plaintiff has the requisite personal stake in the controversy.\"\nId.\nAt 261-62. In Arlington Heights, the defendant's thwarting of plans\nconstituted the injury; the plans could not be effected due to the\ndefendant's conduct. In this case, by contrast, the record does not show\nthat the need for an educational effort resulted from or was connected in\nany clear way to the six allegedly discriminatory advertisements.\nMoreover, the advertisements at issue did not impede the FHC's ability\nto implement its educational plan.\n\n                               13\n\fconnection between this investigation and the\n 538<!>advertisements which form the basis for this suit.\n\nDepositions of members of the FHC staff established that\nthe purchase of newspapers and review of the classified\nsections which comprised the \"investigation\" went on as\npart of the FHC's normal day-to-day operations. This\n\"investigation\" was not motivated by the advertisements at\nissue in this suit or by a complaint about advertising. It\nwas not limited to Montgomery newspapers, and did not\nincrease or go on longer than it otherwise might have as a\nresult of the allegedly discriminatory advertising alleged\nhere.5\n\nThe record before us does not establish that the FHC\naltered its operations in any way as a result of the allegedly\ndiscriminatory advertisements or diverted any of its\nresources to a bona fide investigation. At the summary\njudgment stage, bare allegations of injury such as those\nbased on the \"investigation\" described are not enough to\nestablish standing. This is true even where, as here, an\norganization holds the status of a private attorney general\ncharged with enforcing the provisions of the Fair Housing\nAct. A private attorney general is subject to the following\nrule:\n\n       [A]s long as [the private attorney general] suffers actual\n       injury as a result of the defendant's conduct, he is\n       permitted to prove that the rights of another were\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The \"investigation\" undertaken here differs dramatically from that\ndescribed in Havens. There, the investigation and the allegedly\ndiscriminatory acts were closely linked. Moreover, it was clear that the\norganization in Havens did something different as a result of the\nparticular conduct which was alleged to be illegal. The case before us is\nfundamentally different. The record does not support the conclusion that\nthe FHC in conducting its investigation, responded to the advertisements\nat issue or that it would not have undertaken the same investigative\nefforts in the absence of these advertisements. Although the dissent's\nargument that the \"investigation\" here was sufficient to impart standing\nis appealing, it is simply not supported by the record or by the caselaw.\nWe cannot conclude, and the dissent does not point to anything in the\nrecord which would allow us to conclude that the\"investigation\" was\nconnected in any concrete way to the specific acts of discrimination\nalleged in this suit.\n\n                                14\n\f       infringed. The central issue at this stage of the\n       proceedings is not who possesses the legal rights . . .\n       but whether [the plaintiffs] were genuinely injured by\n       conduct that violates someone's . . . rights, and thus\n       are entitled to seek redress of that harm. . . .\n\nGladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 103\nn.9 (1979) (emphasis added).\n\nAs the district court found, there is no credible evidence\nof injury to the FHC other than the dedication of funds and\nother resources to pursuit of this litigation. The FHC\ncontends that the diversion of resources to litigation is\nalone sufficient to confer standing under Article III. We\ndisagree.\n\nC.\n\nIn deciding organizational standing questions after\nHavens, appellate courts have generally agreed that where\nan organization alleges or is able to show - depending on\nthe stage of the proceeding - that it has devoted additional\nresources to some area of its effort in order to counteract\ndiscrimination, the organization has met the Article III\nstanding requirement. A number of our sister courts have,\nhowever, adopted different views of whether the injury\nnecessary to establish standing flows automatically from\nthe expenses associated with litigation.6 We align ourselves\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. See Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v. BMC\nMarketing Corp., 28 F.3d 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (Havens did not base\nstanding on diversion of resources but on injury caused to organization's\nprograms); Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24 (D.C. Cir. 1990)\n(fair housing organization cannot manufacture the injury necessary to\nmaintain a suit from its expenditure of resources on that very suit);\nRagin v. Macklowe, 6 F.3d 898 (2d Cir. 1993) (housing organization had\nstanding to sue based on diversion of resources to pursue litigation and\nother legal efforts to counteract the discrimination); Hooker v. Weathers,\n990 F.2d 913 (6th Cir. 1993) (fair housing organization had standing\nbased on investigation using testers and confirmation of facts and\ncircumstances alleged in complaint); Housing Opportunities Made Equal,\nInc. v. Cincinnati Enquirer, Inc., 943 F.2d 644 (6th Cir. 1991) (injury\nmay\nbe found where group must devote additional resources to investigating\nand negating impact of discriminatory advertising independent of suit\nchallenging the advertisements); Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d\n1521 (7th Cir. 1990) (to have standing fair housing organization need\nonly show deflection of time and money from counseling to legal efforts).\n\n                               15\n\fwith those courts holding that litigation expenses alone do\nnot constitute damage sufficient to support standing.\n\nWe are persuaded to take this position by the analysis\nset forth by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in\nSpann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\nIn Spann, the court of appeals read Havens narrowly,\nholding that in order to establish standing, an organization\nmust point to a \"concrete and demonstrable injury to [its]\nactivities.\" Id. at 27. The court explained that merely\ndevoting funds to support a lawsuit will not suffice to\nestablish an injury within the scope of Article III:\n\n       An organization cannot, of course, manufacture the\n       injury necessary to maintain a suit from its\n       expenditure of resources on that very suit. Were the\n       rule otherwise, any litigant could create injury in fact\n       by bringing a case, and Article III would present no real\n       limitation.\n\nId. The Court in Spann summarized the holding in Havens\nas follows:\n\n       Havens makes clear . . . that an organization\n       establishes Article III injury if it alleges that\n       purportedly illegal action increased the resources the\n       group must devote to programs independent of the suit\n       challenging the action.\n\nId. (Emphasis added.)\n\nUnder this standard, something more than litigation is\nrequired to establish injury. In Spann, it was the\norganization's \"expenditures to reach out to potential home\nbuyers or renters who are steered away from housing\nopportunities by discriminatory advertising or to monitor\nand to counteract on an ongoing basis public impressions\ncreated by defendants' use of print media\" -- expenditures\nof a type not made in this case -- which satisfied the injury\nrequirement of Article III. Id. at 29.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed its\ncommitment to a narrow reading of Havens in Fair\nEmployment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v. BMC\nMarketing Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1277 (D.C. Cir. 1994):\n\n                               16\n\f       [Havens] did not base standing on the diversion of\n       resources from one program to another, but rather on\n       the alleged injury that the defendants' actions\n       themselves had inflicted upon the organization's\n       programs. To be sure, the Court did mention the \"drain\n       on the organization's resources.\" Yet this drain\n       apparently sprang from the organization's need to\n       \"counteract\" the defendants' assertedly illegal\n       practices, and thus was simply another manifestation\n       of the injury that those practices had inflicted upon\n       \"the organization's non-economic interest in\n       encouraging open housing\" . . . .\n\nThe FHC urges us to reject the analysis set forth in\nSpann and BMC Marketing and to embrace instead the\nresult reached by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit in City of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521 (7th\nCir. 1990). In Bellwood, a real estate brokerage firm and\ntwo of its employees were sued for discriminatory practices\nalleged to violate the Act. On appeal of a jury verdict in\nfavor of the plaintiffs, the court considered whether a\nnonprofit corporation promoting integrated housing lacked\nArticle III standing. Relying on the decision in Havens the\ncourt found that the organization did have standing:\n\n       Havens makes clear . . . that the only injury which\n       must be shown to confer standing on a fair housing\n       agency is deflection of the agency's time and money\n       from counseling to legal efforts directed against\n       discrimination. These are opportunity costs of\n       discrimination since although the counseling is not\n       impaired directly there would be more of it were it not\n       for the defendant's discrimination.\n\nId. at 1526 (emphasis added).\n\nThe district court in this matter declined to follow\nBellwood.7 We are convinced that the district court's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We are convinced that the FHC overstates the breadth of the holding\nin Bellwood. The holding in Bellwood was not that litigation alone\nconstituted injury sufficient to convey standing. In Bellwood, the village\nundertook a bona fide investigation of a number of real estate agencies\nin order to determine whether these agencies were engaged in racial\n\n                                17\n\freliance on the position taken in Spann and BMC Marketing\nrepresents the better-reasoned approach. We hold,\ntherefore, that the pursuit of litigation alone cannot\nconstitute an injury sufficient to establish standing under\nArticle III.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that we\n\n       have no doubt about the sincerity of [the FHC's] stated\n       objectives and the depth of their commitment to them.\n       But the essence of standing \"is not a question of\n       motivation but of possession of the requisite interest\n       that is, or is threatened to be, injured by the\n       unconstitutional conduct.\"\n\nSchlesinger v. Reservists to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208,\n225-26 (1973) (quoting Doremus v. Board of Education, 342\nU.S. 429, 435 (1952)).\n\nWe emphasize, too, that this holding does not\ncompromise our commitment to the laudable goal advanced\nby the FHC; eliminating discrimination in housing is vitally\nimportant. We cannot agree, however, that this goal should\nbe attained by an approach which shrinks the Article III\nstanding requirement to a point where the requisite injury\nflows automatically from the burdens associated with filing\na lawsuit. Resort to this extreme position simply is not\nnecessary. The hurdle raised by the injury element of\nestablished standing principles is not a high one. Fair\nhousing organizations have regularly and successfully\nshown injury in litigating suits designed to eradicate\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsteering. The fair housing organization was hired to carry out the testing\nby sending both black and white \"clients\" to the real estate agencies.\nWhen the tests revealed that steering was taking place, the village, the\nfair housing organization and the testers filed suit. In holding that the\norganization had standing to sue, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit held that the organization's \"legal efforts\" to investigate\nsteering\nwere sufficient to confer standing. Litigation plus some other legal\neffort\n-- there, investigation -- provided the basis for standing. Because the\nFHC did not devote time and resources to legal efforts short of\nlitigation,\nto adopt the dissent's argument and find that the injury requirement has\nbeen met in this case would require that we go beyond the result\nreached in Bellwood.\n\n                               18\n\fdiscrimination illegal under the Fair Housing Act. Our\ndecision should not restrict or impede in any meaningful\nway the ability of these organizations to combat violations\nof the Act. Where discrimination does, in fact, occur, it\nshould not be insurmountably difficult for these\norganizations to establish standing either in their own right\nor on behalf of their members by referring to well-\nestablished standing principles and adjusting their\npleadings and proof accordingly.\n\nV.\n\nWe turn next to the FHC's retaliation claim. In Count II\nof the amended complaint, the FHC alleges that\nMontgomery violated section 3617 of the Act8 by knowingly\nand maliciously creating, publishing in its newspapers, and\nmailing to the legislators of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania, false statements about the FHC, its actions\nand its motivations. The district court granted\nMontgomery's motion for summary judgment on this claim,\nagain on the basis of standing:\n\n       [The FHC] has not set forth any evidence indicating\n       that it has suffered . . . an \"injury in fact\" from\n       defendant's newspaper publications or statements to\n       legislators. The deposition testimony offered by [the\n       FHC] reveals instead that [it] has not lost any revenue,\n       income, government contracts, or members as a result\n       of the publications and statements at issue . . . As[the\n       FHC] has not established that it has suffered an \"injury\n       in fact\" from said publications and statements, this\n       Court concludes that the FHC does not have standing\n       to bring this claim.\n\nFair Housing Council v. Montgomery Newspapers, 1997 WL\n5185 at * 9-10.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. This section provides that:\n\n        It shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere\n       with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of\nhis\n       having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his having aided or\n       encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any\n       right granted or protected by [other sections] of this title.\n\n                                 19\n\fWe have examined the district court's conclusion in light\nof the record and are convinced that the evidence adduced\nby the FHC with respect to the retaliation claim was\nsufficient to withstand Montgomery's motion for summary\njudgment.\n\nIn support of its argument that the district court erred in\ngranting summary judgment on this claim, the FHC directs\nour attention to the following excerpt from the affidavit of\nJames Berry, Executive Director of the FHC:\n\n       7. Some of the falsehoods of defendants were\n       communicated to one of the FHC's primary federal\n       grant funders, and to fair housing advocates around\n       the country. As a result, at least in part, of these\n       falsehoods, [the FHC] was investigated by that primary\n       federal grant funder, and has been questioned by fair\n       housing advocates concerning the FHC's practices as to\n       following the law. [The FHC's] reputation in the fair\n       housing and grant provider communities has been\n       damaged.\n\n       8. [The FHC has] learned . . . that HUD, who received\n       defendants' falsehoods, will not renew one of its grants\n       to [the FHC]. The grant was worth hundreds of\n       thousands of dollars.\n\nThe FHC cites, too, Berry's testimony in deposition that\nhe was contacted by a representative of the Fair Housing\nInitiatives Program (FHIP), a government entity, seeking to\narrange a conference call between Berry and the FHIP\ndirector in order to discuss the substance of lawsuits filed\nby the FHC. Berry was informed that:\n\n       Somebody in the Department of Housing and   Urban\n       Development had read an article that went   out over the\n       Associated Press containing the lies that   Mr. Howe had\n       testified to in front of the Pennsylvania   state\n       legislature.\n\nThe FHIP representative informed Berry that FHIP\npersonnel had \"read about [the FHC] and are very\nconcerned, they've had inquiries from Congress as well as\nthe White House.\" Berry testified that he was then required\nto discuss the terms and phrases underlying FHC lawsuits\nwith FHIP representatives.\n\n                               20\n\fWithout considering any other part of the record cited by\nthe FHC, we are convinced that there was sufficient\nevidence before the district court at summary judgment to\nestablish a triable issue of fact with respect to the\nretaliation claim. Berry's uncontroverted testimony\nindicates, at a minimum, that Montgomery's statements in\nthe press forced the FHC to answer questions posed by\nFHIP and to defend the basis for FHC litigation. Through\nthis testimony, the FHC has offered proof that it sustained\nat least non-economic harm which was \"concrete\" and\n\"particularized\" and \"actual\" or \"imminent.\" See Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 560-61. Accordingly, the district court erred in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Montgomery on the\nretaliation claim.\n\nVI.\n\nBecause we conclude that the FHC succeeded in\nestablishing an \"injury in fact\" sufficient to withstand\nMontgomery's motion for summary judgment on the section\n3617 claims, we will reverse that portion of the order of the\ndistrict court granting summary judgment to Montgomery\non these claims. In all other respects, we will affirm the\norder of the district court.\n\n                               21\n\fNYGAARD, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting.\n\nI agree that the Fair Housing Council has standing to\nassert a claim of retaliation against Montgomery\nNewspapers under 42 U.S.C. S 3617. However, I would go\nfurther and also conclude that the FHC has standing to\nassert a claim of illegal advertising under 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604(c), and that the FHC is injured because it must\ndivert resources to a large-scale educational campaign to\ninform landlords, real estate agents, consumers and the\ndefendant newspaper itself that discrimination based on\nfamilial status violates the Fair Housing Act. The FHC has\nproffered evidence that education is necessary because\nhousing providers were continuing to write advertisements\nthat violated 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c), and the defendant itself,\nMontgomery Newspapers, was continuing to publish the\nillegal advertisements and promote misunderstanding of the\nfamilial status provisions of the Act.\n\nThe majority's view of standing is too narrow, and I am\nconvinced that its opinion will do violence to the law of\nstanding in this circuit. The majority suggests that to be\ninjured, the FHC must have either implemented the\neducational campaign or submitted a more detailed plan to\nthe district court. In the alternative, the majority states that\nthe FHC could have produced a home seeker who was\ndenied housing, deterred from seeking housing, or formed\na misimpression about housing availability as a result of\nthe advertisements published in the Montgomery\nNewspapers. The majority opines that the FHC did not\ndemonstrate the need for the educational program and also\nfailed to show that the plan was implemented. I disagree.\nThe FHC has submitted a detailed plan for its educational\ncampaign, within which it describes exactly why the\ncampaign is a necessary response to the advertisements.\nThis plan is sufficiently concrete to confer standing.\nFurthermore, the FHC does not have to produce an\naggrieved home seeker because it has clearly demonstrated\nthe need for an educational campaign to counter the\nadvertisements that were placed by housing providers in\nflagrant disregard of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c).\n\nThe majority also concludes that investigation and\nlitigation costs alone cannot confer standing. Because I find\n\n                               22\n\fstanding for educational costs, it would ordinarily not be\nnecessary for me to reach this issue. However, I write\nseparately on this issue as well, because I think that costs\nincurred applying legal pressure to a newspaper publishing\nillegal advertisements can confer standing.\n\nI. Article III Standing Requirements\n\nA plaintiff organization has standing if it meets the\nimmutable requirements of Article III, Section 2 of the\nConstitution. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an\ninjury in fact, an invasion of a legally protected interest that\nis concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, not\nconjectural or hypothetical. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992). Second,\nthere must be a causal connection between the injury and\nthe challenged action of the defendant. The injury has to be\nfairly traceable to the defendant's actions, and not the\nresult of the independent action of a party not before the\ncourt. Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S.\n26, 41-42, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 1926 (1976). Third, it must be\nlikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will\nbe redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n561, 112 S. Ct. at 2136; Simon, 426 U.S. at 38, 43, 96 S.\nCt. at 1924, 1926.1 When the Supreme Court considered a\nfair housing organization's standing to sue under the Fair\nHousing Act, it concluded that Congress intended to\nabrogate any additional prudential standing requirements\nand allow standing based only upon the constitutional\nrequirements of Article III. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,\n455 U.S. 363, 372, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 1121 (1982) (citing\nGladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 103\nn.9, 109, 99 S. Ct. 1601, 1609 n. 9, 1612 (1979)).\n\nHavens held that the plaintiff organization had standing\nto sue because the activity that allegedly violated the Fair\nHousing Act perceptibly impaired its counseling and\nreferral services. This impairment met the \"injury in fact\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The district court only addressed the first element of standing,\nholding\nthat the FHC did not show Article III injury. Accordingly, I do not\naddress the final two elements of causation and redressability, although\nI will point out that those two elements are clearly present here.\n\n                               23\n\ftest because a concrete and demonstrable drain on\nresources is a more plausible injury than a conjectural\n\"setback\" to an organization's abstract social interests. Id.\nat 379 (distinguishing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727,\n92 S. Ct. 1361 (1972)). Following Havens, the Courts of\nAppeals have agreed that a fair housing organization will\nhave standing to challenge a newspaper's advertising\npractices under 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) if it can demonstrate\nthat the newspaper's discriminatory advertising caused the\norganization to divert resources to identify and negate the\nimpact of those advertisements. See, e.g., Fair Employment\nCouncil of Greater Washington, Inc. v. BMC Mktg. Corp., 28\nF.3d 1268, 1276-77 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Housing Opportunities\nMade Equal, Inc. v. Cincinnati Enquirer, Inc., 943 F.2d 644\n(6th Cir. 1991); Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24,\n27 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The FHC has clearly met this burden.\n\nThe Circuits are split, though, as to whether the\ndiversion of resources solely for litigation and investigation\nactivities can confer standing. Compare Spann, 899 F.2d at\n27 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (litigation costs cannot confer standing),\nwith Ragin v. Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co., 6 F.3d 898,\n905 (2d Cir. 1993) (finding standing based on staff time\nspent exclusively on litigation), and Hooker v. Weathers,\n990 F.2d 913, 915 (6th Cir. 1993) (investigation to confirm\nfacts in complaint insufficient to confer standing), and City\nof Chicago v. Matchmaker Real Estate Sales Ctr., Inc., 982\nF.2d 1086, 1095 (7th Cir. 1992) (legal efforts directed\nagainst discrimination are sufficient to impart standing).\nThe majority holds that the litigation and investigation\ncosts cannot confer standing. I disagree and would hold\nthat in some situations, like this case, they can constitute\nan Article III injury.\n\nII. Educational Injury\n\nA. Sufficiency of Evidence\n\nAs explained above, the courts interpreting Havens agree\nthat the diversion of resources to educational programs is\nsufficient to impart Article III standing. See, e.g., Spann,\n899 F.2d at 27. A \"concrete drain on time and resources is\nsufficient to satisfy Article III's injury in fact requirement.\"\n\n                               24\n\fSpann, 899 F.2d at 29. An \"identifiable trifle\" of this type of\ninjury will suffice to confer standing upon the FHC.2 United\nStates v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency\nProcedures, 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14, 93 S. Ct. 2405, 2417\nn.14 (1973) (rejecting the argument that standing should be\nlimited to those significantly injured, and ruling that any\nlevel of injury is sufficient to confer standing). Accordingly,\nto demonstrate \"educational injury,\" the FHC must only\nraise a genuine issue of material fact that its plan to\neducate the real estate industry and consumers will be a\nconcrete and demonstrable drain on its resources, and that\nsuch education is necessary to counter the illegal housing\nadvertisements.\n\nThe FHC has presented sufficient evidence of injury to\ncompel my conclusion that Montgomery Newspapers is not\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. James Berry, the\nexecutive director of the FHC, described the campaign by\nwhich the FHC will attempt to educate real estate\nprofessionals. Berry also stated that the FHC will have to\nspend almost $100,000 in newspaper advertising to counter\nMontgomery News' discriminatory messages. Jan Chadwick,\nAssistant Director of the FHC, explained that the FHC has\nformulated \"an educational plan that would educate both\nthe public and the industry what the proper Fair Housing\nlaws are . . . to reverse the damages [caused by\ndiscrimination] in the whole region, specifically families\nwith children.\" This explanation mirrors FHC's allegation\nthat\n\n       \"each act of discrimination conducted in the Delaware\n       Valley causes a setback to the good work accomplished\n       by the FHC's educational and outreach efforts and to\n       the development of an integrated housing community.\n       As a result, the FHC must launch further efforts to\n       undo the damage that the discrimination has caused.\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. We do not confuse this with a \"scintilla of evidence\" which is\nunquestionably insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2512\n(1986). In this case, the FHC has presented sufficient evidence to allow\na reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor on the issue of\nstanding\nto sue under the Fair Housing Act.\n\n                                25\n\f(Pl.'s Am. Comp. P 10.) The FHC also prepared a detailed\nplan entitled \"Appellants' Statement of Proposed Education-\nRepair Campaign.\" The purpose of the plan is to reach,\namong others, consumers, housing providers, and real\nestate professionals to counteract advertisements that leave\nreaders believing that it is legal to turn away families with\nchildren. The \"Proposed Plan\" explains what the FHC\nalleges: a large-scale educational campaign is necessary\nbecause the continued publication of illegal advertisements\ncauses an \"overwhelming misunderstanding\" about the Act.\nThe Plan is specific to the extent that it contains sample\nadvertisements to be placed in Montgomery Newspapers,\nthe frequency of planned publication, a proposed budget for\nexecuting the Plan, and details of educational efforts other\nthan newspaper advertisements.\n\nThe majority states that the only evidence relating to the\neducational effort produced by the FHC was \"an allegation\nthat, at some future time, it would be required to spend\nalmost $100,000 in newspaper advertising and more than\n$300,000 in seminars and mailings to reach consumers to\ncounter the advertisements' discriminatory message.\" This\nstatement is incorrect, based on the substantial record\nevidence.\n\nB. The need for corrective action\n\nThe majority's conclusion crumbles upon examination of\nthe entire Proposed Plan and explanations of the FHC staff,\ndiscussed above. By focusing only on the necessity to\neducate home seekers and consumers, the majority\noverlooks an entire segment of the FHC's mission: to\neducate publishers and housing providers. Montgomery\nNewspapers published discriminatory ads, which itself\ndemonstrates that housing providers and the newspaper do\nnot understand the terms of the Fair Housing Act. Because\nthe FHC aims to ensure compliance by education, it must\nnow divert resources to redress that damage. Thus, I am\ncompelled to conclude that the FHC has suffered the\nrequisite \"identifiable trifle\" of injury to its educational\nprograms.\n\nThe FHC has demonstrated that its educational plan is a\nnecessary response to correct the discriminatory\n\n                                26\n\fadvertisements published by Montgomery Newspapers. The\n\"Proposed Plan\" explains that, among others, real estate\nprofessionals are ignorant of the family status provisions of\nthe Fair Housing Act. Advertisements that contain\ncomments such as \"no children or pets,\" and \"professional\nmale need only apply\" exemplify this ignorance. The FHC\nintends to reach consumers to explain the Fair Housing\nAct. However, the majority fails to recognize that the FHC\nalso plans to explain Fair Housing Act compliance to\nhousing providers and real estate professionals, who place\nand read advertisements in Montgomery Newspapers and\nperpetuate discriminatory advertising.\n\nThe majority suggests that the FHC would have satisfied\nstanding requirements if it could show that home seekers\nhave actually been barred from housing, deterred from\nseeking housing, or formed a misimpression about housing\navailability as a result of the advertisements published in\nthe Montgomery Newspapers. This is simply incorrect. An\naggrieved home seeker is not necessary to show a violation\nof section 3604. Housing providers and newspapers violate\n42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) upon publication. The Fair Housing Act\nexpressly empowers organizations like the FHC to enforce\nits provisions without joining a home seeker as a co-\nplaintiff, 42 U.S.C. SS 3602, 3613, in the federal district\ncourts, 42 U.S.C. S 3613(a)(1)(A), to seek the award of\nactual or punitive damages or the grant of permanent or\ntemporary injunctive relief. 42 U.S.C. S 3613(c)(1).\n\nC. Imminent and Concrete Injury\n\nThe FHC has successfully adduced facts to show concrete\ninjury that is certainly impending, as required by Lujan.\n504 U.S. at 564. The majority concludes that the FHC\nwould be injured if it already implemented the educational\nprogram. This is not correct. The cases are legion\nsupporting a conclusion that the FHC is not required to\nactually pay for the advertising campaign before it can\nassert standing. See, e.g., Pennell v. City of San Jose, 485\nU.S. 1, 8, 108 S. Ct. 849, 855 (1988) (holding that because\nit is not unduly speculative to conclude that the ordinance\nat issue will be enforced against members of the\nAssociation, this is a sufficient threat of actual injury to\nsatisfy Article III); Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289,\n\n                                  27\n\f298, 99 S. Ct. 2301, 2308 (1979) (\"A plaintiff who\nchallenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of\nsustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute's\noperation or enforcement.\"); Duke Power Co. v. Carolina\nEnvtl. Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 98 S. Ct. 2620 (1978)\n(Plaintiff alleged that, if constructed, the power plant's\noperation would cause the emission of radiation. The Court\nheld that the plaintiff's alleged injury was sufficiently\nconcrete to confer standing.); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia,\n262 U.S. 553, 593, 43 S. Ct. 658, 663 (1923) (\"[O]ne does\nnot have to await the consummation of threatened injury to\nobtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending,\nthat is enough.\"); Roe v. Operation Rescue, 919 F.2d 857,\n964-65 (3d Cir. 1990) (holding that clinics not actually\nblockaded by defendant organization had standing because\nthe threat that defendants would blockade the clinics in the\nfuture was real and immediate); Public Interest Research\nGroup, Inc. v. Powell Duffryn, 913 F.2d 64, 71 (3d Cir.\n1990) (plaintiffs' asserted injury, that they would use the\nwater for boating and aesthetic enjoyment if it was not\npolluted, was sufficient to confer standing, even though\nthey had not used the water in its polluted state).\n\nThe FHC also satisfies Lujan by setting forth concrete\nplans for its educational program. The majority categorizes\nthe FHC plan as the \"some day\" intentions prohibited by\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S. Ct. at 2138, and\nsuggests that the FHC has proffered no concrete plans or\nspecifications as to when the plans will be carried out. I\ndisagree. In Lujan, the Supreme Court suggested that had\nthe plaintiffs actually purchased a plane ticket, their plans\nto observe the endangered species would not be \"some-day\nintentions.\" Id. Here, the plan submitted by the FHC is\nmore extensive and expensive than the mere plane ticket in\nLujan.\n\nMoreover, the majority's conclusion is at odds with the\nSupreme Court's holding in Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., wherein mere blueprints\nand building plans were sufficient to confer standing on a\nnon-profit housing organization. 429 U.S. 252, 261, 97 S.\nCt. 555, 561 (1977). The housing organization in Arlington\nHeights planned to build low income housing to further its\n\n                                28\n\finterest in making low cost housing available in areas\nwhere it was scarce, but its plans were thwarted when the\nlocal government denied its zoning request. The Court held\nthat the organization's plans to build, and its related goals,\nwere not an abstract concern and provided the essential\ndimension of specificity required to determine standing at\ntrial. Id. at 263. The situation of the FHC is analogous. The\nFHC plans to educate the public that discrimination based\non familial status is illegal. That plan is equally specific and\ndetailed, and therefore sufficient to confer standing.\n\nIII. Investigation Injury\n\nThe FHC also adduced evidence sufficient to confer\nstanding for a 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) violation based on the\ncosts to investigate the housing advertisements in the\nMontgomery Newspapers. alleged in the complaint\nconstitute injury for standing purposes). Havens found\n\"injury in fact\" when a fair housing organization had to\ndivert resources to \"identify and counteract\" discriminatory\npractices. 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S. Ct. at 1124. Like\n\"educational injury,\" the courts following Havens agree that\ncosts incurred investigating violations of the Fair Housing\nAct can confer standing. See, e.g., Hooker v. Weathers, 990\nF.2d 913, 915 (6th Cir. 1993) (costs incurred in the\ninvestigation to confirm the facts and circumstances).\n\nThe majority erroneously concludes that the FHC\ninvestigation cannot confer standing because it was a\nregular part of the day-to-day operations of the\norganization. It cites \"depositions of FHC staff\" in support\nof this conclusion. Indeed, there was some suggestion in\nthe deposition of Jan Chadwick that reviewing housing\nadvertisements was a regular matter of business for FHC\nstaffers. However, based on the evidence, one could also\nreasonably conclude that the FHC investigation followed\nviolations of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c), and because of repeated\nviolations, became a daily function of the FHC. For\nstanding purposes, we look only for an \"identifiable trifle\" of\ninjury, so the FHC need only submit evidence to create a\ngenuine issue of whether it diverted the slightest amount of\nadditional time to read the Montgomery Newspapers. U.S. v.\nStudents Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, 412\n\n                               29\n\fU.S. 669, 689 n.14, 93 S. Ct. 2405, 2417 n.14 (1973). I\nbelieve they have met this burden.\n\nThe FHC made a specific showing of its increased efforts\nto identify and eventually counteract discriminatory ads\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c). The record shows that\ninvestigation efforts began in 1989, when the FHC began\nreviewing the housing advertisements in the Montgomery\nNewspapers. The investigation was prompted by the FHC's\ndiscovery that despite a recent amendment to the Fair\nHousing Act, local papers did not comply with the\nprovisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of family\nstatus. The FHC filed charges with the Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission and the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, but the illegal\nadvertisements continued. The graph submitted by the FHC\nshows that the FHC devoted more resources to identify the\ndiscriminatory advertisements in the Montgomery\nNewspapers than it would have normally directed toward\nsimply reviewing housing advertisements. The FHC also\nproffered the affidavit of Executive Director James Berry\nexplaining the increased investigative efforts, and this was\nsupported by the materials charting the resources\ndedicated to investigating the housing advertisements in\nthe Montgomery News.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery Newspapers suggested during\noral argument that the FHC could have sent testers to\ndetermine whether the ads were placed with the intention\nof discrimination on the basis of familial status. Certainly,\nthat was one potential investigatory technique available to\nit. However, no one technique is required to establish\nstanding. A violation of section 3604(c) occurs upon\npublication. This is distinguishable from a violation of\nsection 3604(d), which occurs when misleading information\nis given to a tester. Naturally, one method of identifying\nviolations under section 3604(c) is to read the newspaper.\nFHC did just that, and its efforts were intended to identify\nthe pattern and practices of discriminatory conduct and to\ncounteract it through legal pressure and education.\n\nCongress intended to confer broad rights to enforce the\nFair Housing Act. See Havens, 455 U.S. at 374 n.14, 102\nS. Ct. at 1122 n.14. For example, a tester may pose as a\n\n                               30\n\fprospective purchaser, expect unlawful practices based on\nrace, and have standing to sue under 42 U.S.C. S 3604(d)\nif the housing provider misrepresents the availability of\nhousing. This is distinguishable from 42 U.S.C. S 3604(a),\nwhich requires a bona fide offer for housing to present a\nclaim of a discriminatory refusal to sell or rent. However,\nlike the tester provision, there is no \"bona fide\" requirement\nfor enforcement of the advertisement provision.\n\nNevertheless, the majority suggests that the investigation\nmust be motivated by a complaint about advertising in the\nMontgomery Newspapers. This is not correct. Independent\ninvestigations not initiated by complaints were also a part\nof the regular activities of the fair housing organization in\nHavens. In Havens, the organization's activities included:\n\n       \"conducting independent investigations of real estate\n       brokers located in the metropolitan area to determine\n       whether housing is being made available without\n       regard to race; and taking appropriate steps to\n       eliminate any racial discriminatory housing practices it\n       may have found to exist.\"\n\nColes v. Havens Realty Corp., 633 F.2d 384, 385 (4th Cir.\n1980), aff'd sub. nom. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455\nU.S. 363, 102 S. Ct. 1114 (1982). The Court of Appeals for\nthe Fourth Circuit concluded that the drain on resources\nnecessary to identify violations of the Fair Housing Act is\nsufficient to confer standing, irrespective of whether such\ninvestigation was motivated by a complaint.\n\nIV. Litigation Injury\n\nThe FHC's \"litigation injuries\" in the form of attorneys'\nfees to bring this case are insufficient to impart standing\nunder the Fair Housing Act, especially since the act\nprovides for recovery of attorneys' fees. 42 U.S.C.\nS 3613(c)(2). My agreement with the majority stops there.\n\nHavens did not specifically decide whether the costs of\nlitigation or enforcement of the Fair Housing Act are\nsufficient to confer standing. Arguably, this activity would\nfall under the category of activities intended to \"counteract\"\ndiscrimination. Courts from the Second and Seventh\n\n                               31\n\fCircuits have read Havens to confer standing even when\nresources are diverted for litigation purposes only. See, e.g.,\nCity of Chicago v. Matchmaker Real Estate Sales Ctr., Inc.,\n982 F.2d 1086, 1095 (7th Cir. 1992); Village of Bellwood v.\nDwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521, 1526 (7th Cir. 1990); Ragin v.\nHarry Macklowe Real Estate Co., 6 F.3d 898, 905 (2d Cir.\n1993). The majority does not find these cases persuasive,\ninstead relying on the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit's conclusion that litigation costs alone\ncannot confer standing because it would allow litigants to\nachieve manufactured, or \"purely self-referential injury\" by\nmerely filing the complaint. Fair Employment Council of\nGreater Washington, Inc. v. BMC Marketing Corp., 28 F.3d\n1268 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899\nF.2d 24 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\nIn my opinion, the FHC has standing, even under the\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's\nholdings, because many activities that fall between\ninvestigation and litigation can confer standing under\nHavens. For example, in this case, the FHC chose many\nnon-litigation methods to apply legal pressure upon the\nMontgomery Newspapers to enforce the Fair Housing Act.\nThe FHC filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human\nResources Commission. In addition, the FHC attempted to\nnotify the newspaper of its violations of section 3604 (c). My\nconclusion to confer standing upon fair housing\norganizations for enforcement activities, other than the\nfiling of the lawsuit, does not conflict with the Court of\nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit's cases that the majority finds\npersuasive. BMC Marketing and Spann only prohibit\nconferral of standing from the act of filing the lawsuit.\n\nMy conclusion is also entirely consistent with the policies\nof the Fair Housing Act. First, Congress intended that\ngroups like the FHC take action to enforce the provisions of\nthe Fair Housing Act. If we do not recognize the efforts that\nprecede litigation as injury, we will cramp the options now\nopen to fair housing organizations that are laboring to\ncounteract discrimination. Large scale, long term pre-\nlitigation efforts that draw from program resources should\nconstitute injury for standing purposes even if they\nculminate in litigation. Second, I see little danger that\n\n                               32\n\fplaintiffs may \"manufacture standing\" in the context of the\nFair Housing Act. It is not that easy. The greater danger is\nexaggerating the risk of nullifying Article III, and thereby\neviscerating the statutory scheme of the Fair Housing Act,\nwhich clearly relies upon private enforcement to ensure\ncompliance.\n\nThe FHC correctly states that the Fair Housing Act relies\nupon private attorneys general to enforce its provisions. See\n42 U.S.C. S 3613;3 Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,\n409 U.S. 205, 210-211, 93 S. Ct. 364, 367-68 (1972)\n(noting the paucity of statutory remedies); Hooker v.\nWeathers, 990 F.2d 913, 915 (6th Cir. 1993) (finding\nstanding under Havens due to the increase of resources\ndevoted to programs independent of its suit challenging the\naction); Housing Opportunities Made Equal v. Cincinnati\nEnquirer, Inc., 943 F.2d 644, 646 (6th Cir. 1991) (\"Courts\nhave given a broad reading to the FHA in order to fulfill its\nremedial purpose.\"). Accordingly, we have an obligation to\naddress the issue of standing (pursuant to \"litigation\ninjuries\") so as to fulfill the private enforcement provisions\nof the Fair Housing Act. \"We can give vitality to [The Fair\nHousing Act] only by a generous construction which gives\nstanding to sue to all . . . who are injured by . . .\ndiscrimination . . . within the coverage of the statute.\"\nTrafficante, 409 U.S. at 212, 93 S. Ct. at 368. We should\ncarefully consider which \"litigation injuries\" confer standing\nto maintain the integrity of Article III, while still allowing\nfair housing organizations to fulfill their role as private\nattorneys general. Spann, 899 F.2d at 30 (citing Trafficante,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. A violation of the Fair Housing Act does not constitute per se injury\nto\na fair housing organization. The FHC is mistaken, to the extent that it\nreads Bennett v. Spear to confer standing without meeting Article III\nrequirements. ___ U.S. ___, 117 S. Ct. 1154 (1997). Bennett discusses\nthe \"zone of interest test,\" a jurisprudential test for standing, which\napplies above and beyond the Article III. Id. at 1160 (stating Article III\nis\nan irreducible constitutional minimum). The \"zone of interest test\" does\nnot apply to standing to pursue an action under the Fair Housing Act.\nTrafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 US. 205, 209, 93 S. Ct.\n364,\n367 (1972). Despite its misinterpretation of Bennett, the Council has\nstruck on an important point regarding their role in ensuring compliance\nwith the Fair Housing Act.\n\n                               33\n\f409 U.S. at 211, 93 S.Ct. at 368). As explained above, I\nbelieve I have done so in this case: allowing the FHC's\ninvestigations and legal pressure, applied through letters or\nadministrative proceedings to confer standing, but rejecting\nthe theory that the FHC's costs to file this lawsuit can\nimpart standing.\n\nFinally, we cannot overlook the will of the legislature in\ndetermining whether the FHC has standing to sue. Havens,\n455 U.S. at 373, 102 S. Ct. at 1121. The injury \"required\nby Article III may exist solely by virtue of `statutes creating\nlegal rights, the invasion of which creates standing.' \" Id.\n(citing Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S. Ct. 2197,\n2205 (1975)). \"The policies of the Act and the concrete\ninjuries alleged by the plaintiff organizations thus\nintertwine to support plaintiffs' standing to bring this suit.\"\nSpann, 899 F.2d at 31 (citations omitted). Congress\nspecifically endorsed the values that the FHC seeks to\nenforce and their methods of enforcement, in the Fair\nHousing Act:\n\n       \"The Congress finds that (1) in the past half decade\n       there have been major legislative and administrative\n       changes in Federal fair housing and fair lending laws\n       and substantial improvements in the Nation's\n       understanding of discrimination in the housing\n       markets; . . . (9) the proven efficacy of private nonprofit\n       fair housing enforcement organizations and\n       community-based efforts makes support for these\n       organizations a necessary component of the fair\n       housing enforcement system.\"\n\nFair Housing Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 102-550, Section\n905(a), 106 Stat. 3869 (1992).\n\nIn sum, we should not so fear the possibility of\n\"manufactured standing\" that we set barriers artificially\nhigh and thereby nullify the private enforcement provisions\nof the Fair Housing Act.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons and upon all the foregoing\ngrounds, I conclude that the FHC has standing to advance\n\n                               34\n\fa claim under 42 U.S.C. S3604(c).

SS 3604 and 3617, and the\nPennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. S 955. The\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment was based on\nits conclusion that the FHC lacked standing under Article\nIII of the United States Constitution to maintain this suit.\nBecause we are convinced by the unique set of facts\nsurrounding the section 3604(c) claims that the FHC has\nfailed to satisfy the \"injury in fact\" requirement embodied in\nArticle III, we find that the grant of summary judgment as\nto those claims was appropriate. As to the section 3617\nretaliation claims, however, we find that the FHC has raised\nissues of fact sufficient to withstand Montgomery's motion\nfor summary judgment. We will, therefore, reverse the\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment as to the\nretaliation claim and remand for further consideration.\n\nI.\n\nThe FHC, a fair housing group which has operated in the\nPhiladelphia area for more than forty years, defines itself as\na non-profit organization whose \"purpose is to educate and\npromote fair housing and to oppose segregation based on\nthe protected classes found in the Fair Housing Act of\n1968, as amended.\" On April 6, 1994, the FHCfiled a\ncomplaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations\nCommission (\"PHRC\") and HUD alleging that from\nNovember 24, 1993 forward, Montgomery \"accepted and\npublished advertisements that were discriminatory based\non gender and familial status\" in violation of state and\nfederal law. The complaint included copies of six\nadvertisements which appeared in Montgomery newspapers\nbetween November, 1993 and March, 1994. Each of these\n\n                               3\n\fadvertisements contained one of the following allegedly\nobjectionable phrases: \"mature person\"; \"ideal for quiet and\nreserved single and-or couple\"; \"professional male . . . only\";\nand \"quiet mature setting.\" On January 5, 1996, the PHRC\nnotified the FHC that \"investigation of the complaint [had]\nresulted in a Finding of Probable Cause. . . .\"\n\nAccording to the FHC, Montgomery \"continued publishing\ndiscriminatory speech.\" Therefore on February 21, 1996,\nthe FHC filed suit in district court. An amended complaint\nwas filed on April 10, 1996. In the amended complaint, the\nFHC alleged that Montgomery's acceptance and publication\nof discriminatory housing advertisements frustrated the\norganization's mission and resulted in damage to the\norganization caused by the need to divert resources to fight\nthe discrimination. The FHC also alleged that as a result of\nthe discriminatory advertisements, \"families with children\nwere barred from housing\" in violation of state and federal\nlaw.\n\nThe amended complaint added allegations that\nMontgomery had intimidated, coerced, interfered with and\nretaliated against the FHC as a result of the FHC's\ncomplaint against Montgomery. The FHC contended that in\nnewspaper articles, testimony before the state legislature,\nand other false statements made by or on behalf of\nMontgomery, the FHC had been placed in a position of\nridicule which impaired the organization's effectiveness.\n\nOn September 25, 1996, Montgomery filed a motion for\nsummary judgment which was granted on January 6,\n1997. The district court held that the FHC lacked standing\nto pursue any of the claims alleged.\n\nIn arriving at this conclusion the district court separated\nthe FHC's damage claims into three categories: (1)\nfrustration of the FHC mission; (2) diversion of resources to\nmeasures designed to correct the harm caused by the\ndiscriminatory advertising; and (3) diversion of resources to\nlitigation.\n\nAnalyzing the first category of claims, the court found\nthat frustration of an organization's mission can never, as\na matter of law, suffice to satisfy the Article III requirement\nof injury in fact. With respect to the alleged diversion of\n\n                                4\n\fresources to programs designed to counteract the\ndiscrimination, the district court found that the FHC \"failed\nto set forth specific evidence demonstrating that its various\nprograms have been `perceptibly impaired as a result of the\ndiversion of its resources . . . to activities counteracting\n[the] allegedly discriminatory acts.' [P]laintiff has failed . . .\nto initiate any such educational program or to expend any\nfunds at all on the development of such a program.\" Fair\nHousing Council v.

The standing requirements embodied in the\n\"case\" or \"controversy\" provision of Article III mean that in\nevery case, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate:\n\n       An \"injury in fact\" -- an invasion of a judicially\n       cognizable interest which is (a) concrete and\n       particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not\n       conjectural or hypothetical; second, there be a causal\n       connection between the injury and the conduct\n       complained of -- the injury has to be \"fairly trace[able]\n       to the challenged action of the defendant, and not .. .\n       the result [of] the independent action of some third\n       party not before the court. Third, it must be \"likely,\" as\n       opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the injury will be\n       \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n\nId. at 560-61.

First, the Court\n       has held that when the asserted harm is a \"generalized\n       grievance\" shared in substantially equal measure by all\n       or a large class of citizens, that harm alone does not\n       warrant exercise of jurisdiction. Second, even when the\n       plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to meet the \"case\n       or controversy\" requirements, this Court has held that\n       the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights\n       and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the\n       legal rights or interests of other parties. Without such\n       limitations\n       . . . the courts would be called upon to decide abstract\n       questions of wide public significance even though other\n       governmental institutions may be more competent . . .\n       and judicial intervention may be unnecessary to\n       protect individual rights.\n\n(Citations omitted.)\n\nCongress may grant an express right of action to those\nwho would otherwise lack standing due to application of\nthe prudential requirements.

In Havens, a realty company\nand one of its employees were alleged to have engaged in\nracial \"steering\" in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The\nplaintiffs included a housing organization, Housing\nOpportunities Made Equal (\"HOME\"), which had a mission\ngenerally similar to that of the FHC here. HOME alleged\nthat it had suffered injury as a result of the \"steering,\"\nclaiming that its counseling and referral services had been\nfrustrated with a consequent drain on its resources. The\ncomplaint also contained allegations that individual\nplaintiffs had been \"deprived . . . of the . . . benefits of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Act provides that \"an aggrieved person may commence a civil action\nin an appropriate United States district court. . . .\", S 3613(a)(1)(A),\nand\ndefines an \"aggrieved person\" (including corporations and associations)\nas:\n\n       any person who--\n       (1) claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing\npractice;\n       or\n       (2) believes that such person will be injured by a discriminatory\n       housing practice that is about to occur.\n\nSection 3602(I).\n\n                               8\n\finterracial   associations that arise from living in integrated\ncommunities   free from discriminatory housing practices.\"\nId. at 369.   The Supreme Court held that HOME was\nentitled to   sue in its own right.\n\nAfter explaining that standing under the Fair Housing Act\nis constrained only by Article III requirements and outlining\nthose requirements, the Court wrote:\n\n       In determining whether HOME has standing under the\n       Fair Housing Act, we conduct the same inquiry as in\n       the case of an individual: Has the plaintiff \" `alleged\n       such a personal stake in the outcome of the\n       controversy' as to warrant his invocation of federal\n       court jurisdiction?\" . . . If, as broadly alleged,\n       petitioner's . . . practices have perceptibly impaired\n       HOME's ability to provide counseling and referral\n       services for low- and moderate-income homeseekers,\n       there can be no question that the organization has\n       suffered injury in fact. Such concrete and demonstrable\n       injury to the organization's activities -- with the\n       consequent drain on the organization's resources--\n       constitutes far more than simply a setback to the\n       organization's abstract social interests.\n\nId. 455 U.S. at 378-79 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nBefore we analyze the FHC's particular allegations of\nharm, we note that there is a critical distinction between\nHavens and this case. In Havens, the plaintiff 's damage\nallegations were examined in the context of a motion to\ndismiss. Here, however, the issue of standing was before\nthe district court on a motion for summary judgment. While\nthere is no dispute that the FHC's damage allegations2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. In its amended complaint the FHC made the following allegations\nbearing on injury:\n\n       10. [E]ach act of discrimination conducted in the Delaware Valley\n       causes a setback to the good work accomplished by the FHC's\n       educational outreach efforts and to the development of an\nintegrated\n       housing community. As a result, the FHC must launch further\n       efforts to undo the damage that the discrimination has caused . . .\n.\n       The further efforts required are a substantial drain on its\nresources\n       and harms [sic] the FHC.\n\n                                 9\n\ftrack the language in Havens and were sufficient to\nwithstand a motion to dismiss, something more than these\nnaked allegations was required at the summary judgment\nstage. \"Since [the elements of standing] are not mere\npleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of\nthe plaintiff's case, each element must be supported in the\nsame way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears\nthe burden of proof, i.e. with the manner and degree of\nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\"\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\n\nIn order to defeat the summary judgment motion based\non the issue of standing, the FHC was required to submit\n\"affidavits or other evidence showing through specific facts\n. . . that . . . it [was] `directly' affected [by the alleged\ndiscrimination].\" Id. at 562 (emphasis added). According to\nthe district court, the FHC failed to carry its burden at\nsummary judgment, producing nothing of substance to\nsupport the mere allegations set forth in the complaint. As\nto the discrimination claims, we agree.\n\nIV.\n\nBecause both the FHC and the district court considered\nby category the damage claims based on alleged\ndiscrimination, we do the same, turning first to the\nallegations regarding frustration of mission. In an effort to\nestablish standing, the FHC argued that the discriminatory\nadvertisements \"cause[d] a setback to the good work\naccomplished by the FHC's educational outreach efforts\nand to the development of an integrated housing\ncommunity.\" The district court rejected this alleged\n\"frustration of mission\" as a basis for organizational\nstanding, stating that \"such an injury cannot constitute, as\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       20.

Further, the FHC is now forced to divert funds to\n       counteract the discriminatory message and acts of Defendants and\n       has had its purpose frustrated by Defendants' discriminatory\n       conduct.\n\n                               10\n\fa matter of law, an `injury in fact.' \" Fair Housing Council,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *4. This is not an accurate statement of\nthe law. Havens made clear that where discriminatory\n\"practices have perceptibly impaired [an organization's\nability to carry out its mission], there can be no question\nthat the organization has suffered injury in fact.\" 455 U.S.\nat 379. Nonetheless, we are convinced that the allegations\nof frustration of mission were insufficient to defeat\nsummary judgment as the FHC failed to substantiate any\nperceptible impairment to its mission.\n\nThe FHC contends that its mission suffered the\nimpairment required to establish standing when it was\nforced to divert resources from counseling and other\nactivities to: (1) an educational campaign designed to\ncounteract the discriminatory effect of the advertisements;\n(2) an investigation designed to determine the existence and\nextent of on-going discrimination in advertising; and (3)\nlitigation. We address the FHC's alleged diversion of\nresources in each of these categories seriatim.\n\nA.\n\nWe turn first to the FHC's claim that it was damaged by\nthe need to divert funds \"over the course of three years to\nrepair damage caused by\" the discriminatory\nadvertisements. Although pressed to do so in discovery and\nin oral argument before us, the FHC was unable to\nestablish any connection between the allegedly\ndiscriminatory advertisements underlying this suit and the\nneed for or implementation of a remedial educational\ncampaign. The FHC was unable to verify that any member\nof the public had been denied housing or was deterred from\nseeking housing based on the advertisements. The FHC was\nalso unable to establish that any member of the public\ncomplained about the contents of the advertisements or\nformed a misimpression about the legality of their contents.\nIn fact, the FHC was unable to show that anyone other\nthan the FHC staff even read the relevant advertisements.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. We do not, as the dissent argues, impose a bona-fide home-seeker\nrequirement. We adhere instead to the letter of the caselaw which clearly\n\n                               11\n\fNot only did the FHC fail to introduce evidence of the need\nfor an educational program, it failed to show that any\neducational effort was ever implemented.\n\nThe only evidence relating to implementation of an\neducational effort was the FHC's allegation that, at some\nfuture time, it would be required to spend almost $100,000\nin newspaper advertising and over $300,000 in seminars\nand mailings to reach consumers to counter the\nadvertisements' discriminatory message. Although the\nquestionable advertisements were published in 1993 and\n1994, the FHC admitted that it has yet to undertake any\neducational countermeasures or to offer counseling directed\nat reversing the damage alleged to have been caused by the\nadvertisements. The FHC was unable to say when such\nmeasures might be undertaken or when funds might\nactually be expended in support of this educational effort.\nThese inchoate plans for future programs are insufficient to\ndemonstrate injury for purposes of Article III:\n\n       Such \"some day\" intentions -- without any description\n       of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of\n       when the some day will be -- do not support afinding\n       of the \"actual or imminent\" injury that our cases\n       require.\n\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 564.4 The FHC's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nestablishes that an alleged injury must be shown to flow from the\nconduct alleged. Where, as here, the record fails to show that any\nhousing provider, real estate professional, or member of the public ever\nsaw the advertisements specified, the essential causal nexus between the\nadvertisements and the injury alleged is missing. Contrary to what the\ndissent suggests, the injury alleged must result from the particular\ndiscriminatory acts, not from the general conduct of multiple parties over\nthe course of years.\n\n4. While the dissent argues that \"the cases are legion supporting a\nconclusion that the FHC is not required to actually pay for the\nadvertising campaign before it can assert standing,\" the cases cited\ndiffer\nfundamentally from this one in that they address circumstances where\nan injury is threatened. These cases hold that where the threat of injury\nis real, a plaintiff will not be denied standing. Here, however, injury is\nalleged to have already occurred. The FHC argues that it suffered injury\n\n                               12\n\ffailure to document the need for corrective education\nengendered by the advertisements cited, coupled with the\nfact that it has yet to devote any of its resources to pursuit\nof an educational campaign, undermines its claim to have\nsuffered actual injury. The record is devoid of evidence that\nthe FHC was required to modify any of its services in\nresponse to the objectionable advertisements.\n\nB.\n\nThe FHC's claim that it suffered palpable injury when it\nwas forced to divert resources to investigation also fails for\nlack of proof. The \"investigation\" to which the FHC refers\nconsisted of having its staff members review classified\nadvertisements placed in Montgomery and other suburban\nPhiladelphia newspapers on an ongoing basis for evidence\nof discrimination. This investigation is alleged to have\nnecessitated a diversion of staff resources which could have\nbeen directed to counseling and other organizational\nfunctions. The record fails, however, to establish any\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwhen it diverted resources to an education campaign. Yet, in the more\nthan three years following publication of the relevant advertisements, the\nFHC has failed to implement the campaign.\n\nThe dissent's reliance on Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHousing Dev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (1997), to support standing based\non plans alone is also misplaced. In Arlington Heights, a housing\norganization generated blueprints and building plans in preparation for\nthe construction of low-income housing. These plans were thwarted by\nthe defendant's denial of a zoning request. The Supreme Court held that\nwhere \"the challenged action [stood] as an absolute barrier to\nconstructing the housing that [the plaintiff] contracted to place on the\nsite\" and the planned project was \"detailed and specific,\" the \"court\n[was]\nnot required to engage in undue speculation as a predicate for finding\nthat the plaintiff has the requisite personal stake in the controversy.\"\nId.\nAt 261-62. In Arlington Heights, the defendant's thwarting of plans\nconstituted the injury; the plans could not be effected due to the\ndefendant's conduct. In this case, by contrast, the record does not show\nthat the need for an educational effort resulted from or was connected in\nany clear way to the six allegedly discriminatory advertisements.\nMoreover, the advertisements at issue did not impede the FHC's ability\nto implement its educational plan.\n\n                               13\n\fconnection between this investigation and the\n 538<!>advertisements which form the basis for this suit.\n\nDepositions of members of the FHC staff established that\nthe purchase of newspapers and review of the classified\nsections which comprised the \"investigation\" went on as\npart of the FHC's normal day-to-day operations. This\n\"investigation\" was not motivated by the advertisements at\nissue in this suit or by a complaint about advertising. It\nwas not limited to Montgomery newspapers, and did not\nincrease or go on longer than it otherwise might have as a\nresult of the allegedly discriminatory advertising alleged\nhere.5\n\nThe record before us does not establish that the FHC\naltered its operations in any way as a result of the allegedly\ndiscriminatory advertisements or diverted any of its\nresources to a bona fide investigation. At the summary\njudgment stage, bare allegations of injury such as those\nbased on the \"investigation\" described are not enough to\nestablish standing. This is true even where, as here, an\norganization holds the status of a private attorney general\ncharged with enforcing the provisions of the Fair Housing\nAct. A private attorney general is subject to the following\nrule:\n\n       [A]s long as [the private attorney general] suffers actual\n       injury as a result of the defendant's conduct, he is\n       permitted to prove that the rights of another were\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The \"investigation\" undertaken here differs dramatically from that\ndescribed in Havens. There, the investigation and the allegedly\ndiscriminatory acts were closely linked. Moreover, it was clear that the\norganization in Havens did something different as a result of the\nparticular conduct which was alleged to be illegal. The case before us is\nfundamentally different. The record does not support the conclusion that\nthe FHC in conducting its investigation, responded to the advertisements\nat issue or that it would not have undertaken the same investigative\nefforts in the absence of these advertisements. Although the dissent's\nargument that the \"investigation\" here was sufficient to impart standing\nis appealing, it is simply not supported by the record or by the caselaw.\nWe cannot conclude, and the dissent does not point to anything in the\nrecord which would allow us to conclude that the\"investigation\" was\nconnected in any concrete way to the specific acts of discrimination\nalleged in this suit.\n\n                                14\n\f       infringed. The central issue at this stage of the\n       proceedings is not who possesses the legal rights . . .\n       but whether [the plaintiffs] were genuinely injured by\n       conduct that violates someone's . . . rights, and thus\n       are entitled to seek redress of that harm. . . .\n\nGladstone Realtors v.

Cir. 1990).\nIn Spann, the court of appeals read Havens narrowly,\nholding that in order to establish standing, an organization\nmust point to a \"concrete and demonstrable injury to [its]\nactivities.\" Id. at 27. The court explained that merely\ndevoting funds to support a lawsuit will not suffice to\nestablish an injury within the scope of Article III:\n\n       An organization cannot, of course, manufacture the\n       injury necessary to maintain a suit from its\n       expenditure of resources on that very suit. Were the\n       rule otherwise, any litigant could create injury in fact\n       by bringing a case, and Article III would present no real\n       limitation.\n\nId. The Court in Spann summarized the holding in Havens\nas follows:\n\n       Havens makes clear . . . that an organization\n       establishes Article III injury if it alleges that\n       purportedly illegal action increased the resources the\n       group must devote to programs independent of the suit\n       challenging the action.\n\nId. (Emphasis added.)\n\nUnder this standard, something more than litigation is\nrequired to establish injury. In Spann, it was the\norganization's \"expenditures to reach out to potential home\nbuyers or renters who are steered away from housing\nopportunities by discriminatory advertising or to monitor\nand to counteract on an ongoing basis public impressions\ncreated by defendants' use of print media\" -- expenditures\nof a type not made in this case -- which satisfied the injury\nrequirement of Article III.

To be sure, the Court did mention the \"drain\n       on the organization's resources.\" Yet this drain\n       apparently sprang from the organization's need to\n       \"counteract\" the defendants' assertedly illegal\n       practices, and thus was simply another manifestation\n       of the injury that those practices had inflicted upon\n       \"the organization's non-economic interest in\n       encouraging open housing\" . . . .\n\nThe FHC urges us to reject the analysis set forth in\nSpann and BMC Marketing and to embrace instead the\nresult reached by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit in City of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536509\"><a href=\"/opinion/536509/village-of-bellwood-v-chandra-dwivedi/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 1990). In Bellwood, a real estate brokerage firm and\ntwo of its employees were sued for discriminatory practices\nalleged to violate the Act. On appeal of a jury verdict in\nfavor of the plaintiffs, the court considered whether a\nnonprofit corporation promoting integrated housing lacked\nArticle III standing. Relying on the decision in Havens the\ncourt found that the organization did have standing:\n\n       Havens makes clear . . . that the only injury which\n       must be shown to confer standing on a fair housing\n       agency is deflection of the agency's time and money\n       from counseling to legal efforts directed against\n       discrimination. These are opportunity costs of\n       discrimination since although the counseling is not\n       impaired directly there would be more of it were it not\n       for the defendant's discrimination.\n\nId. at 1526 (emphasis added).\n\nThe district court in this matter declined to follow\nBellwood.7 We are convinced that the district court's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We are convinced that the FHC overstates the breadth of the holding\nin Bellwood. The holding in Bellwood was not that litigation alone\nconstituted injury sufficient to convey standing. In Bellwood, the village\nundertook a bona fide investigation of a number of real estate agencies\nin order to determine whether these agencies were engaged in racial\n\n                                17\n\freliance on the position taken in Spann and BMC Marketing\nrepresents the better-reasoned approach. We hold,\ntherefore, that the pursuit of litigation alone cannot\nconstitute an injury sufficient to establish standing under\nArticle III.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that we\n\n       have no doubt about the sincerity of [the FHC's] stated\n       objectives and the depth of their commitment to them.\n       But the essence of standing \"is not a question of\n       motivation but of possession of the requisite interest\n       that is, or is threatened to be, injured by the\n       unconstitutional conduct.\"\n\nSchlesinger v.

We cannot agree, however, that this goal should\nbe attained by an approach which shrinks the Article III\nstanding requirement to a point where the requisite injury\nflows automatically from the burdens associated with filing\na lawsuit. Resort to this extreme position simply is not\nnecessary. The hurdle raised by the injury element of\nestablished standing principles is not a high one. Fair\nhousing organizations have regularly and successfully\nshown injury in litigating suits designed to eradicate\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsteering. The fair housing organization was hired to carry out the testing\nby sending both black and white \"clients\" to the real estate agencies.\nWhen the tests revealed that steering was taking place, the village, the\nfair housing organization and the testers filed suit. In holding that the\norganization had standing to sue, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit held that the organization's \"legal efforts\" to investigate\nsteering\nwere sufficient to confer standing. Litigation plus some other legal\neffort\n-- there, investigation -- provided the basis for standing. Because the\nFHC did not devote time and resources to legal efforts short of\nlitigation,\nto adopt the dissent's argument and find that the injury requirement has\nbeen met in this case would require that we go beyond the result\nreached in Bellwood.\n\n                               18\n\fdiscrimination illegal under the Fair Housing Act. Our\ndecision should not restrict or impede in any meaningful\nway the ability of these organizations to combat violations\nof the Act. Where discrimination does, in fact, occur, it\nshould not be insurmountably difficult for these\norganizations to establish standing either in their own right\nor on behalf of their members by referring to well-\nestablished standing principles and adjusting their\npleadings and proof accordingly.\n\nV.\n\nWe turn next to the FHC's retaliation claim. In Count II\nof the amended complaint, the FHC alleges that\nMontgomery violated section 3617 of the Act8 by knowingly\nand maliciously creating, publishing in its newspapers, and\nmailing to the legislators of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania, false statements about the FHC, its actions\nand its motivations. The district court granted\nMontgomery's motion for summary judgment on this claim,\nagain on the basis of standing:\n\n       [The FHC] has not set forth any evidence indicating\n       that it has suffered . . . an \"injury in fact\" from\n       defendant's newspaper publications or statements to\n       legislators. The deposition testimony offered by [the\n       FHC] reveals instead that [it] has not lost any revenue,\n       income, government contracts, or members as a result\n       of the publications and statements at issue . . . As[the\n       FHC] has not established that it has suffered an \"injury\n       in fact\" from said publications and statements, this\n       Court concludes that the FHC does not have standing\n       to bring this claim.\n\nFair Housing Council v.

Some of the falsehoods of defendants were\n       communicated to one of the FHC's primary federal\n       grant funders, and to fair housing advocates around\n       the country. As a result, at least in part, of these\n       falsehoods, [the FHC] was investigated by that primary\n       federal grant funder, and has been questioned by fair\n       housing advocates concerning the FHC's practices as to\n       following the law. [The FHC's] reputation in the fair\n       housing and grant provider communities has been\n       damaged.\n\n       8. [The FHC has] learned . . . that HUD, who received\n       defendants' falsehoods, will not renew one of its grants\n       to [the FHC]. The grant was worth hundreds of\n       thousands of dollars.\n\nThe FHC cites, too, Berry's testimony in deposition that\nhe was contacted by a representative of the Fair Housing\nInitiatives Program (FHIP), a government entity, seeking to\narrange a conference call between Berry and the FHIP\ndirector in order to discuss the substance of lawsuits filed\nby the FHC. Berry was informed that:\n\n       Somebody in the Department of Housing and   Urban\n       Development had read an article that went   out over the\n       Associated Press containing the lies that   Mr. Howe had\n       testified to in front of the Pennsylvania   state\n       legislature.\n\nThe FHIP representative informed Berry that FHIP\npersonnel had \"read about [the FHC] and are very\nconcerned, they've had inquiries from Congress as well as\nthe White House.\" Berry testified that he was then required\nto discuss the terms and phrases underlying FHC lawsuits\nwith FHIP representatives.\n\n                               20\n\fWithout considering any other part of the record cited by\nthe FHC, we are convinced that there was sufficient\nevidence before the district court at summary judgment to\nestablish a triable issue of fact with respect to the\nretaliation claim. Berry's uncontroverted testimony\nindicates, at a minimum, that Montgomery's statements in\nthe press forced the FHC to answer questions posed by\nFHIP and to defend the basis for FHC litigation. Through\nthis testimony, the FHC has offered proof that it sustained\nat least non-economic harm which was \"concrete\" and\n\"particularized\" and \"actual\" or \"imminent.\" See Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 560-61. Accordingly, the district court erred in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Montgomery on the\nretaliation claim.\n\nVI.\n\nBecause we conclude that the FHC succeeded in\nestablishing an \"injury in fact\" sufficient to withstand\nMontgomery's motion for summary judgment on the section\n3617 claims, we will reverse that portion of the order of the\ndistrict court granting summary judgment to Montgomery\non these claims. In all other respects, we will affirm the\norder of the district court.\n\n                               21\n\fNYGAARD, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting.\n\nI agree that the Fair Housing Council has standing to\nassert a claim of retaliation against Montgomery\nNewspapers under 42 U.S.C. S 3617. However, I would go\nfurther and also conclude that the FHC has standing to\nassert a claim of illegal advertising under 42 U.S.C.\nS 3604(c), and that the FHC is injured because it must\ndivert resources to a large-scale educational campaign to\ninform landlords, real estate agents, consumers and the\ndefendant newspaper itself that discrimination based on\nfamilial status violates the Fair Housing Act. The FHC has\nproffered evidence that education is necessary because\nhousing providers were continuing to write advertisements\nthat violated 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c), and the defendant itself,\nMontgomery Newspapers, was continuing to publish the\nillegal advertisements and promote misunderstanding of the\nfamilial status provisions of the Act.\n\nThe majority's view of standing is too narrow, and I am\nconvinced that its opinion will do violence to the law of\nstanding in this circuit. The majority suggests that to be\ninjured, the FHC must have either implemented the\neducational campaign or submitted a more detailed plan to\nthe district court. In the alternative, the majority states that\nthe FHC could have produced a home seeker who was\ndenied housing, deterred from seeking housing, or formed\na misimpression about housing availability as a result of\nthe advertisements published in the Montgomery\nNewspapers. The majority opines that the FHC did not\ndemonstrate the need for the educational program and also\nfailed to show that the plan was implemented. I disagree.\nThe FHC has submitted a detailed plan for its educational\ncampaign, within which it describes exactly why the\ncampaign is a necessary response to the advertisements.\nThis plan is sufficiently concrete to confer standing.\nFurthermore, the FHC does not have to produce an\naggrieved home seeker because it has clearly demonstrated\nthe need for an educational campaign to counter the\nadvertisements that were placed by housing providers in\nflagrant disregard of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c).\n\nThe majority also concludes that investigation and\nlitigation costs alone cannot confer standing. Because I find\n\n                               22\n\fstanding for educational costs, it would ordinarily not be\nnecessary for me to reach this issue. However, I write\nseparately on this issue as well, because I think that costs\nincurred applying legal pressure to a newspaper publishing\nillegal advertisements can confer standing.\n\nI. Article III Standing Requirements\n\nA plaintiff organization has standing if it meets the\nimmutable requirements of Article III, Section 2 of the\nConstitution.

See, e.g., Spann,\n899 F.2d at 27.

Accordingly,\nto demonstrate \"educational injury,\" the FHC must only\nraise a genuine issue of material fact that its plan to\neducate the real estate industry and consumers will be a\nconcrete and demonstrable drain on its resources, and that\nsuch education is necessary to counter the illegal housing\nadvertisements.\n\nThe FHC has presented sufficient evidence of injury to\ncompel my conclusion that Montgomery Newspapers is not\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. James Berry, the\nexecutive director of the FHC, described the campaign by\nwhich the FHC will attempt to educate real estate\nprofessionals. Berry also stated that the FHC will have to\nspend almost $100,000 in newspaper advertising to counter\nMontgomery News' discriminatory messages. Jan Chadwick,\nAssistant Director of the FHC, explained that the FHC has\nformulated \"an educational plan that would educate both\nthe public and the industry what the proper Fair Housing\nlaws are . . . to reverse the damages [caused by\ndiscrimination] in the whole region, specifically families\nwith children.\" This explanation mirrors FHC's allegation\nthat\n\n       \"each act of discrimination conducted in the Delaware\n       Valley causes a setback to the good work accomplished\n       by the FHC's educational and outreach efforts and to\n       the development of an integrated housing community.\n       As a result, the FHC must launch further efforts to\n       undo the damage that the discrimination has caused.\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2.

In this case, the FHC has presented sufficient evidence to allow\na reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor on the issue of\nstanding\nto sue under the Fair Housing Act.\n\n                                25\n\f(Pl.'s Am. Comp. P 10.) The FHC also prepared a detailed\nplan entitled \"Appellants' Statement of Proposed Education-\nRepair Campaign.\" The purpose of the plan is to reach,\namong others, consumers, housing providers, and real\nestate professionals to counteract advertisements that leave\nreaders believing that it is legal to turn away families with\nchildren. The \"Proposed Plan\" explains what the FHC\nalleges: a large-scale educational campaign is necessary\nbecause the continued publication of illegal advertisements\ncauses an \"overwhelming misunderstanding\" about the Act.\nThe Plan is specific to the extent that it contains sample\nadvertisements to be placed in Montgomery Newspapers,\nthe frequency of planned publication, a proposed budget for\nexecuting the Plan, and details of educational efforts other\nthan newspaper advertisements.\n\nThe majority states that the only evidence relating to the\neducational effort produced by the FHC was \"an allegation\nthat, at some future time, it would be required to spend\nalmost $100,000 in newspaper advertising and more than\n$300,000 in seminars and mailings to reach consumers to\ncounter the advertisements' discriminatory message.\" This\nstatement is incorrect, based on the substantial record\nevidence.\n\nB. The need for corrective action\n\nThe majority's conclusion crumbles upon examination of\nthe entire Proposed Plan and explanations of the FHC staff,\ndiscussed above. By focusing only on the necessity to\neducate home seekers and consumers, the majority\noverlooks an entire segment of the FHC's mission: to\neducate publishers and housing providers. Montgomery\nNewspapers published discriminatory ads, which itself\ndemonstrates that housing providers and the newspaper do\nnot understand the terms of the Fair Housing Act. Because\nthe FHC aims to ensure compliance by education, it must\nnow divert resources to redress that damage. Thus, I am\ncompelled to conclude that the FHC has suffered the\nrequisite \"identifiable trifle\" of injury to its educational\nprograms.\n\nThe FHC has demonstrated that its educational plan is a\nnecessary response to correct the discriminatory\n\n                                26\n\fadvertisements published by Montgomery Newspapers. The\n\"Proposed Plan\" explains that, among others, real estate\nprofessionals are ignorant of the family status provisions of\nthe Fair Housing Act. Advertisements that contain\ncomments such as \"no children or pets,\" and \"professional\nmale need only apply\" exemplify this ignorance. The FHC\nintends to reach consumers to explain the Fair Housing\nAct. However, the majority fails to recognize that the FHC\nalso plans to explain Fair Housing Act compliance to\nhousing providers and real estate professionals, who place\nand read advertisements in Montgomery Newspapers and\nperpetuate discriminatory advertising.\n\nThe majority suggests that the FHC would have satisfied\nstanding requirements if it could show that home seekers\nhave actually been barred from housing, deterred from\nseeking housing, or formed a misimpression about housing\navailability as a result of the advertisements published in\nthe Montgomery Newspapers. This is simply incorrect. An\naggrieved home seeker is not necessary to show a violation\nof section 3604. Housing providers and newspapers violate\n42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) upon publication. The Fair Housing Act\nexpressly empowers organizations like the FHC to enforce\nits provisions without joining a home seeker as a co-\nplaintiff, 42 U.S.C. SS 3602, 3613, in the federal district\ncourts, 42 U.S.C. S 3613(a)(1)(A), to seek the award of\nactual or punitive damages or the grant of permanent or\ntemporary injunctive relief. 42 U.S.C. S 3613(c)(1).\n\nC. Imminent and Concrete Injury\n\nThe FHC has successfully adduced facts to show concrete\ninjury that is certainly impending, as required by Lujan.\n504 U.S. at 564. The majority concludes that the FHC\nwould be injured if it already implemented the educational\nprogram. This is not correct. The cases are legion\nsupporting a conclusion that the FHC is not required to\nactually pay for the advertising campaign before it can\nassert standing. See, e.g., Pennell v.

The majority categorizes\nthe FHC plan as the \"some day\" intentions prohibited by\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S. Ct. at 2138, and\nsuggests that the FHC has proffered no concrete plans or\nspecifications as to when the plans will be carried out. I\ndisagree. In Lujan, the Supreme Court suggested that had\nthe plaintiffs actually purchased a plane ticket, their plans\nto observe the endangered species would not be \"some-day\nintentions.\" Id. Here, the plan submitted by the FHC is\nmore extensive and expensive than the mere plane ticket in\nLujan.\n\nMoreover, the majority's conclusion is at odds with the\nSupreme Court's holding in Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., wherein mere blueprints\nand building plans were sufficient to confer standing on a\nnon-profit housing organization. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261, 97 S.\nCt. 555, 561 (1977). The housing organization in Arlington\nHeights planned to build low income housing to further its\n\n                                28\n\finterest in making low cost housing available in areas\nwhere it was scarce, but its plans were thwarted when the\nlocal government denied its zoning request. The Court held\nthat the organization's plans to build, and its related goals,\nwere not an abstract concern and provided the essential\ndimension of specificity required to determine standing at\ntrial. Id. at 263. The situation of the FHC is analogous. The\nFHC plans to educate the public that discrimination based\non familial status is illegal. That plan is equally specific and\ndetailed, and therefore sufficient to confer standing.\n\nIII. Investigation Injury\n\nThe FHC also adduced evidence sufficient to confer\nstanding for a 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c) violation based on the\ncosts to investigate the housing advertisements in the\nMontgomery Newspapers. alleged in the complaint\nconstitute injury for standing purposes). Havens found\n\"injury in fact\" when a fair housing organization had to\ndivert resources to \"identify and counteract\" discriminatory\npractices. 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S. Ct. at 1124. Like\n\"educational injury,\" the courts following Havens agree that\ncosts incurred investigating violations of the Fair Housing\nAct can confer standing. See, e.g., Hooker v. Weathers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604160\"><a href=\"/opinion/604160/sandra-hooker-richard-hooker-and-fair-housing-contact-service-v-terry/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 915 (6th Cir. 1993) (costs incurred in the\ninvestigation to confirm the facts and circumstances).\n\nThe majority erroneously concludes that the FHC\ninvestigation cannot confer standing because it was a\nregular part of the day-to-day operations of the\norganization. It cites \"depositions of FHC staff\" in support\nof this conclusion. Indeed, there was some suggestion in\nthe deposition of Jan Chadwick that reviewing housing\nadvertisements was a regular matter of business for FHC\nstaffers. However, based on the evidence, one could also\nreasonably conclude that the FHC investigation followed\nviolations of 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c), and because of repeated\nviolations, became a daily function of the FHC. For\nstanding purposes, we look only for an \"identifiable trifle\" of\ninjury, so the FHC need only submit evidence to create a\ngenuine issue of whether it diverted the slightest amount of\nadditional time to read the Montgomery Newspapers. U.S. v.\nStudents Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, 412\n\n                               </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689 n.14, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108824\"><a href=\"/opinion/108824/united-states-v-students-challenging-regulatory-agency-procedures-scrap/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2417 n.14 (1973). I\nbelieve they have met this burden.\n\nThe FHC made a specific showing of its increased efforts\nto identify and eventually counteract discriminatory ads\nunder 42 U.S.C. S 3604(c). The record shows that\ninvestigation efforts began in 1989, when the FHC began\nreviewing the housing advertisements in the Montgomery\nNewspapers. The investigation was prompted by the FHC's\ndiscovery that despite a recent amendment to the Fair\nHousing Act, local papers did not comply with the\nprovisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of family\nstatus. The FHC filed charges with the Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission and the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, but the illegal\nadvertisements continued. The graph submitted by the FHC\nshows that the FHC devoted more resources to identify the\ndiscriminatory advertisements in the Montgomery\nNewspapers than it would have normally directed toward\nsimply reviewing housing advertisements. The FHC also\nproffered the affidavit of Executive Director James Berry\nexplaining the increased investigative efforts, and this was\nsupported by the materials charting the resources\ndedicated to investigating the housing advertisements in\nthe Montgomery News.\n\nCounsel for Montgomery Newspapers suggested during\noral argument that the FHC could have sent testers to\ndetermine whether the ads were placed with the intention\nof discrimination on the basis of familial status. Certainly,\nthat was one potential investigatory technique available to\nit. However, no one technique is required to establish\nstanding. A violation of section 3604(c) occurs upon\npublication. This is distinguishable from a violation of\nsection 3604(d), which occurs when misleading information\nis given to a tester. Naturally, one method of identifying\nviolations under section 3604(c) is to read the newspaper.\nFHC did just that, and its efforts were intended to identify\nthe pattern and practices of discriminatory conduct and to\ncounteract it through legal pressure and education.\n\nCongress intended to confer broad rights to enforce the\nFair Housing Act. See Havens, 455 U.S. at 374 n.14, 102\nS. Ct. at 1122 n.14. For example, a tester may pose as a\n\n                               30\n\fprospective purchaser, expect unlawful practices based on\nrace, and have standing to sue under 42 U.S.C. S 3604(d)\nif the housing provider misrepresents the availability of\nhousing. This is distinguishable from 42 U.S.C. S 3604(a),\nwhich requires a bona fide offer for housing to present a\nclaim of a discriminatory refusal to sell or rent. However,\nlike the tester provision, there is no \"bona fide\" requirement\nfor enforcement of the advertisement provision.\n\nNevertheless, the majority suggests that the investigation\nmust be motivated by a complaint about advertising in the\nMontgomery Newspapers. This is not correct. Independent\ninvestigations not initiated by complaints were also a part\nof the regular activities of the fair housing organization in\nHavens. In Havens, the organization's activities included:\n\n       \"conducting independent investigations of real estate\n       brokers located in the metropolitan area to determine\n       whether housing is being made available without\n       regard to race; and taking appropriate steps to\n       eliminate any racial discriminatory housing practices it\n       may have found to exist.\"\n\nColes v.

The Court of Appeals for\nthe Fourth Circuit concluded that the drain on resources\nnecessary to identify violations of the Fair Housing Act is\nsufficient to confer standing, irrespective of whether such\ninvestigation was motivated by a complaint.\n\nIV. Litigation Injury\n\nThe FHC's \"litigation injuries\" in the form of attorneys'\nfees to bring this case are insufficient to impart standing\nunder the Fair Housing Act, especially since the act\nprovides for recovery of attorneys' fees. 42 U.S.C.\nS 3613(c)(2). My agreement with the majority stops there.\n\nHavens did not specifically decide whether the costs of\nlitigation or enforcement of the Fair Housing Act are\nsufficient to confer standing. Arguably, this activity would\nfall under the category of activities intended to \"counteract\"\ndiscrimination. Courts from the Second and Seventh\n\n                               31\n\fCircuits have read Havens to confer standing even when\nresources are diverted for litigation purposes only.

Cir. 1990).\n\nIn my opinion, the FHC has standing, even under the\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's\nholdings, because many activities that fall between\ninvestigation and litigation can confer standing under\nHavens. For example, in this case, the FHC chose many\nnon-litigation methods to apply legal pressure upon the\nMontgomery Newspapers to enforce the Fair Housing Act.\nThe FHC filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human\nResources Commission. In addition, the FHC attempted to\nnotify the newspaper of its violations of section 3604 (c). My\nconclusion to confer standing upon fair housing\norganizations for enforcement activities, other than the\nfiling of the lawsuit, does not conflict with the Court of\nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit's cases that the majority finds\npersuasive. BMC Marketing and Spann only prohibit\nconferral of standing from the act of filing the lawsuit.\n\nMy conclusion is also entirely consistent with the policies\nof the Fair Housing Act. First, Congress intended that\ngroups like the FHC take action to enforce the provisions of\nthe Fair Housing Act. If we do not recognize the efforts that\nprecede litigation as injury, we will cramp the options now\nopen to fair housing organizations that are laboring to\ncounteract discrimination. Large scale, long term pre-\nlitigation efforts that draw from program resources should\nconstitute injury for standing purposes even if they\nculminate in litigation. Second, I see little danger that\n\n                               32\n\fplaintiffs may \"manufacture standing\" in the context of the\nFair Housing Act. It is not that easy. The greater danger is\nexaggerating the risk of nullifying Article III, and thereby\neviscerating the statutory scheme of the Fair Housing Act,\nwhich clearly relies upon private enforcement to ensure\ncompliance.\n\nThe FHC correctly states that the Fair Housing Act relies\nupon private attorneys general to enforce its provisions.

Accordingly, we have an obligation to\naddress the issue of standing (pursuant to \"litigation\ninjuries\") so as to fulfill the private enforcement provisions\nof the Fair Housing Act. \"We can give vitality to [The Fair\nHousing Act] only by a generous construction which gives\nstanding to sue to all . . . who are injured by . . .\ndiscrimination . . . within the coverage of the statute.\"\nTrafficante, 409 U.S. at 212, 93 S.

We should\ncarefully consider which \"litigation injuries\" confer standing\nto maintain the integrity of Article III, while still allowing\nfair housing organizations to fulfill their role as private\nattorneys general.

As explained above, I\nbelieve I have done so in this case: allowing the FHC's\ninvestigations and legal pressure, applied through letters or\nadministrative proceedings to confer standing, but rejecting\nthe theory that the FHC's costs to file this lawsuit can\nimpart standing.\n\nFinally, we cannot overlook the will of the legislature in\ndetermining whether the FHC has standing to sue. Havens,\n455 U.S. at 373, 102 S. Ct. at 1121.

Congress\nspecifically endorsed the values that the FHC seeks to\nenforce and their methods of enforcement, in the Fair\nHousing Act:\n\n       \"The Congress finds that (1) in the past half decade\n       there have been major legislative and administrative\n       changes in Federal fair housing and fair lending laws\n       and substantial improvements in the Nation's\n       understanding of discrimination in the housing\n       markets; . . . (9) the proven efficacy of private nonprofit\n       fair housing enforcement organizations and\n       community-based efforts makes support for these\n       organizations a necessary component of the fair\n       housing enforcement system.\"\n\nFair Housing Act of 1968, Pub. L.
