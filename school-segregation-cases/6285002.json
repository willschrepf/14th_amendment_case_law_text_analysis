After reviewing the submission, District 60 found several\n\ninadequacies with LEARN’s proposal and denied the application to open the school. LEARN\n\nappealed the denial to defendant, the Illinois State Charter School Commission (Commission),\n\nwho concluded that LEARN’s proposal was in compliance with the requirements of the Charter\n\nSchools Law (105 ILCS 5/27A-1 et seq. (West 2014)) and in the best interests of the students the\n\nschool was designed to serve. The Commission accordingly reversed the decision of District 60\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nand agreed to a charter with LEARN, which was certified by defendant, the Illinois State Board\n\nof Education (ISBE), thus establishing the charter school. District 60 subsequently filed a\n\ncomplaint in the circuit court for administrative review and alleged that the Commission\n\ncommitted multiple violations of the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/1 et seq. (West 2014)).\n\nThe circuit court affirmed the Commission’s decision and dismissed the remaining counts of\n\nDistrict 60’s complaint. Meanwhile, in the fall of 2015 and during the pendency of the circuit\n\ncourt proceedings, LEARN began operating its charter school in Waukegan with approximately\n\n200 students from kindergarten to third grade.\n\n¶2     Before this court, District 60 contends that (1) the Commission and ISBE lost jurisdiction\n\nover LEARN’s appeal and certification when they failed to adhere to the statutory timeline of the\n\nCharter Schools Law, (2) the Commission improperly reversed the district’s decision to deny\n\nLEARN’s proposal where the application was deficient in several manners and not in the best\n\ninterests of the students the school was designed to serve, (3) the Commission violated the\n\ndistrict’s due process rights, (4) the Commission committed multiple violations of the Open\n\nMeetings Act, and (5) the circuit court erred in dismissing the remaining counts of its complaint.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n¶3                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4                                A. The Charter Schools Law\n\n¶5     A charter school is a tuition-free public school supported by public funds but operated by\n\na nonprofit entity independent from the school district in which it operates. 105 ILCS 5/27A­\n\n5(a), (e) (West 2014); Comprehensive Community Solutions, Inc. v. Rockford School District No.\n\n205, 216 Ill. 2d 455, 458 (2005). In 1996, the Illinois legislature enacted the Charter Schools\n\nLaw as a means to provide alternative public education models that were innovative and flexible\n\n                                                 -2­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nbut still maintained high levels of student performance with a particular focus on students who\n\nwere less likely to succeed in a traditional educational environment because of “physical,\n\nemotional, socioeconomic, or cultural factors.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-2(a), (b), 27A-3 (West 2014).\n\nTo promote innovation and flexibility, the Charter Schools Law exempts charter schools from\n\nseveral state laws and regulations that are applicable to traditional schools. Id. § 27A-5(g). A\n\ncharter school operates under a charter, or contract, between the nonprofit entity and the school’s\n\nauthorizer, which may be the local school board or the Commission, depending on who\n\nultimately approves the charter. Id. §§ 27A-6(a), 27A-9(f).\n\n¶6      Charter schools are open for enrollment “to any pupil who resides within the geographic\n\nboundaries of the area served by the local school board.” Id. § 27A-4(d). If there are more\n\napplicants to the school than spaces available, enrollees must be selected by a lottery. Id. § 27A­\n\n4(h). Because charter schools are supported by public funds and enroll students who otherwise\n\nwould attend traditional public schools, they take funding away from the local school district. Id.\n\n§§ 27A-9(f), 27A-11(b). Part of the charter school’s funding is based on a percentage of the local\n\nschool district’s per capita tuition charge, at the time of LEARN’s proposal between 75% and\n\n125%, multiplied by the amount of students enrolled in the charter school that reside in the local\n\nschool district. 1 Id. § 27A-11(b).\n\n¶7      An entity that wants to open a charter school must submit a proposal to the school board\n\nin the district where the charter school would be located. Id. § 27A-7(a). In order to demonstrate\n\nthat the proposed charter school would be a suitable educational alternative, the proposal must\n\n        1\n          The per capita tuition charge is essentially a calculation used to quantify the amount of money a\nschool district pays from its own resources for each student enrolled in its schools. Recently, our\nlegislature changed the permissible funding range of charter schools to between 97% and 103% of the\nlocal school district’s per capita tuition charge. Pub. Act 100-465 (eff. Aug. 31, 2017) (amending 105\nILCS 5/27A-11(b)).\n\n                                                   -3­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\ncontain several requirements, including identifying two potential locations for the school;\n\ndescribing the school’s educational program, goals, objectives and performance standards; and\n\nproviding evidence that the terms of the proposed charter are “economically sound” for both the\n\nschool and the district. Id. §§ 27A-7(a)(3), (5), (7), (9).\n\n¶8      Following the submission of the proposal, the local school board must vote to either grant\n\nor deny the charter school’s application. Id. § 27A-8(e). If the board denies the application, the\n\napplicant may appeal the denial to the Commission, who subsequently conducts a de novo\n\nreview of the proposal. Id. § 27A-8(g); 23 Ill. Adm. Code 650.110(d)(1) (2012). The\n\nCommission may reverse the denial if it “finds that the proposal (i) is in compliance with [the\n\nCharter Schools Law] and (ii) is in the best interests of the students the charter school is designed\n\nto serve.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h) (West 2014).\n\n¶9      If the Commission reverses the local school board’s denial, the Commission itself\n\nbecomes the charter school’s authorizer, meaning it oversees the charter school rather the school\n\nboard. Id. §§ 27A-3, 27A-9(f). Under these circumstances, the charter school also becomes its\n\nown local educational agency (id. § 27A-5(k)), which under federal law has a specific meaning.\n\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 7801(26)(A) (2012). As its own local educational agency, the charter school\n\nbecomes entirely responsible for implementing services required by law that ordinarily would be\n\nthe responsibility of the local school district, such as implementing procedures to comply with\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. (2012)); see 105 ILCS\n\n5/14-1.01 et seq. (West 2014). Regardless of who authorizes the charter school, ISBE must\n\ncertify the application and charter before the school begins to operate. 105 ILCS 5/27A-6(d),\n\n27A-9(f) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 10                            B. Waukegan Community Unit School District 60\n\n\n                                                  -4­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 11   During the 2013-2014 school year, District 60 served approximately 16,300 students.\n\nAmong its students, 77% were Hispanic, 16% were black and 4% were white. Additionally, 72%\n\nof District 60’s students were low-income; 29% were English language learners (ELL), generally\n\nstudents whose native language is not English; and 12% had disabilities. In the Illinois Standards\n\nAchievement Test (ISAT), 39% of District 60’s students met or exceeded the state standards\n\ncompared to the statewide average of 59%. District 60’s graduation rate was 76% compared to\n\nthe statewide average of 86%, and 18% of its students were “college ready” compared to the\n\nstatewide average of 46%.\n\n¶ 12                                 C. LEARN’s Proposal\n\n¶ 13   In 2014, LEARN, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity whose first charter school opened in 2001,\n\noperated eight charter schools in the Chicago area, including one in North Chicago, and served\n\napproximately 3600 elementary and middle school students. LEARN’s mission was to provide\n\nminority and low-income students “with the academic foundation and ambition to earn a college\n\ndegree,” and to that end, it focused on elementary education where it believed “the ambition and\n\nacademic foundation for college must be sown and cultivated.” Among LEARN’s students, 89%\n\nwere black, 9% were Hispanic, and 89% were low-income. LEARN touted that 95% of its\n\nstudents graduated from high school and attended college.\n\n¶ 14    During the spring of 2014, LEARN conducted a needs assessment of various\n\ncommunities in the Chicago area and identified District 60 as one that could benefit from a\n\nLEARN charter school. On November 14, 2014, based on this perceived need, LEARN\n\nsubmitted a proposal to District 60 to open a charter school in Waukegan that would open in\n\nSeptember 2015. LEARN envisioned that the Waukegan campus would initially enroll 200\n\nstudents in kindergarten through third grade and add one grade per year until the school had 600\n\n\n                                              -5­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nstudents enrolled in 2021 and was a fully functioning kindergarten through eighth grade (K-8)\n\nschool.\n\n¶ 15      In its proposal, LEARN supplied various data that compared the academic performance\n\nof its students to District 60’s students. In particular, in 2013 ISAT testing, 54% of LEARN’s\n\nChicago students met or exceeded the state standards. However, among students who had\n\nattended a LEARN school for five or more years, 66% met or exceeded the state standards\n\nwhereas, among students who had attended a LEARN school for only one year, 39% met or\n\nexceeded the state standards. Additionally, in 2013 ISAT testing, LEARN’s students\n\noutperformed District 60’s students overall in reading and mathematics, as well as in those\n\nsubjects for the Hispanic, low-income, limited English proficiency, and black subgroups. The\n\ndata also showed that LEARN’s students overall fell below the statewide average in reading and\n\nmathematics, but exceeded the statewide average in those subjects for the Hispanic, low-income,\n\nlimited English proficiency, and black subgroups.\n\n¶ 16      The proposal stated that LEARN would utilize the Common Core standards and focus on\n\nfour core subjects: English language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. LEARN\n\nprovided a detailed description of its proposed curriculum on these subjects and noted that its\n\neducational plan also placed a “special emphasis” on STEM (science, technology, engineering\n\nand mathematics) learning. LEARN also would ensure that its students received weekly\n\n“enrichment” classes in visual and performance arts, technology, physical education, and\n\nSpanish.\n\n¶ 17      LEARN’s proposal described how it would meet the needs of ELL students and students\n\nwith disabilities. Concerning ELL students, the proposal indicated that LEARN would identify\n\nthem through a survey, use different educational models depending on how many students had\n\n\n                                              -6­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nbeen identified, and monitor their progress with various assessments. Concerning students with\n\ndisabilities, LEARN noted how students would be identified and believed that such students\n\nwere “better served” with “an inclusion program rather than a pullout program.” LEARN\n\naccordingly would first attempt to provide accommodations in the general classroom. LEARN\n\nalso stated that it employed occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, social\n\nworkers, counselors, and psychologists.\n\n¶ 18   The proposal discussed LEARN’s utilization of data-based instruction, its academic\n\nperformance goals, its school culture and climate, and what the school calendar and daily\n\nschedule would look like. The proposal provided various school policies, including a student\n\ncode of conduct, school safety protocols, and how teachers would be evaluated. Additionally, the\n\nproposal talked about LEARN’s student recruitment strategy, the school’s proposed operational\n\nstructure, and many other details necessary to the functioning of a school.\n\n¶ 19   LEARN identified two different locations for the school. The first site, an 18,000-square\n\nfoot stand-alone facility, was located at 2634 Grand Avenue in Waukegan, and had previously\n\nbeen used as a medical office building. As constructed, the building could support a kindergarten\n\nthrough fifth grade school, but with an addition could support a K-8 school. The facility was\n\navailable for lease or purchase but would require a zoning variance. Capital improvements were\n\nalso necessary, and the building had one current tenant. The second site, a 91,000 square foot\n\nfacility connected to a retail mall, was located at 2700 North Belvidere Road in Waukegan. The\n\nbuilding was available only to lease but large enough to accommodate a K-8 school. The\n\nbuilding required rezoning and capital improvements. LEARN provided an estimated five- to\n\nsix-month timeline to make either location operational and noted its past experience in\n\ntransforming other facilities into schools.\n\n\n                                               -7­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 20   Additionally, LEARN’s proposal discussed the finances of LEARN itself and included an\n\naudited financial statement as well as provided a budget and budget narrative for the proposed\n\nschool. According to LEARN’s most recent audit, as of June 30, 2012, it had approximately\n\n$16.6 million in assets and $8.7 million in liabilities. In each year from 2012 to 2014, LEARN\n\nhad raised over $3 million. The budget for the proposed school assumed certain enrollment\n\nnumbers and forecasted the school’s financial position for six years, projecting its income,\n\nexpenses, and potential capital expenditures. Concerning income, LEARN sought a per capita\n\ntuition charge of $10,132 but also intended to obtain additional funding from loans, grants, and\n\nother contributions from foundations and individuals. Concerning expenses, LEARN stated that,\n\nbased on its experience, it would need “a contingency expense” equal to 10% of its total\n\nexpenses to withstand any unexpected costs.\n\n¶ 21   Lastly, the proposal contained the proposed charter agreement between LEARN and\n\nDistrict 60, insurance information, and several appendices of documents, including detailed\n\nprogram frameworks for different subjects, sample sequence reports, and a sample Common\n\nCore standards teaching training agenda.\n\n¶ 22                                D. District 60’s Decision\n\n¶ 23   On January 6, 2015, District 60 denied LEARN’s proposal, finding several inadequacies,\n\nincluding (1) the lack of community support, (2) “serious flaws and gaps” with the proposed\n\neducational program concerning, in particular, services to special education students and ELL\n\nstudents, (3) the lack of “significant achievement” of LEARN North Chicago, which was located\n\nin a community with comparable demographics to Waukegan, and (4) “lingering questions about\n\nclimate and culture in LEARN schools.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 24   Additionally, District 60 determined that the proposed school would not be economically\n\nsound and identified multiple issues with the financial aspect of the proposal. These included that\n\nLEARN’s “year end fund balance was negative indicating a deficit” as of June 30, 2012, and its\n\n“current ratio,” a measure of liquidity determined by dividing assets by liabilities, was 1.91, thus\n\nbelow “the commonly accepted threshold of 2.0.” District 60 also observed that LEARN had not\n\nprovided audited financial reports from the 2013 fiscal year, suggesting to the district that\n\nLEARN’s financial position had worsened. District 60 also pinpointed several issues with the\n\nschool’s proposed budget, including that LEARN failed to provide evidence of specific funding\n\nsources, did not take into consideration transportation costs for its students, neglected to provide\n\nsufficient information on a food service program, and failed to adequately consider the financial\n\nimpact of serving students with special needs.\n\n¶ 25   Moreover, District 60 found that the proposed school would “cause grievous financial\n\nharm” to the district by shifting “scarce” resources away from it. District 60 determined that it\n\nwould lose nearly $23 million over six years if the school operated as intended, which would\n\n“significantly impair[ ]” the district’s ability to meet its fixed overhead and operational costs.\n\nDistrict 60 further asserted that it would have to make significant reductions in services, forgo\n\ncurrent educational initiatives, and add to its $49.6 million of long-term debt.\n\n¶ 26                           E. LEARN’s Appeal to the Commission\n\n¶ 27   On February 5, 2015, LEARN appealed District 60’s decision to the Commission. In its\n\nappeal, LEARN included a memorandum that reiterated the information contained in its\n\nproposal, responded to the alleged inadequacies raised by District 60, and included information\n\nnot contained in its proposal to provide added support and update its proposal “based on\n\nprogress” that had occurred after the original submission. District 60 did not object to LEARN’s\n\n\n                                                 -9­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nrequest, and the Commission accepted the new information. The additional information included\n\ntwo new proposed locations for the charter school, further financial information, supplementary\n\ncurriculum information, elaboration on its strategy for serving ELL students, and plans for\n\nbecoming its own local educational agency.\n\n¶ 28   The first new site was a 32,000-square foot two-story facility located at 800 South\n\nGenesee Street in Waukegan. The building was built in 2005, in excellent condition and already\n\nhad more than 30 classrooms, a full gym, a cafeteria, offices and other space necessary for a\n\nschool. The building only needed a minimal investment in order to become operational as a\n\nschool and also could accommodate the school’s anticipated growth. LEARN also noted that the\n\nbuilding’s owner had expressed a desire to lease the facility to it. Given these details, LEARN\n\ndeemed the site “the most viable option.” The second new site was a 37,000-square foot two-\n\nstory facility located at 202 North Genesee Street in Waukegan. The facility was relatively new\n\nand had an open, unfinished design inside that could be refurbished to function as a school more\n\nquickly than the original two sites. It was also large enough to accommodate the anticipated\n\ngrowth of the school. LEARN stated that construction could be performed in phases and\n\nsegregated from school activities.\n\n¶ 29   LEARN also responded to District 60’s assertions concerning its financial health, the\n\nprojected budget for the school, and the financial impact on the district. LEARN disputed\n\nDistrict 60’s computation of its year-end fund balance, insisting it was not negative, but rather a\n\npositive $7.9 million for the 2012 fiscal year. LEARN provided an update on its current assets\n\nand liabilities, which resulted in a current ratio of 2.16 as of January 2015, as well as audited\n\nfinancial statements from 2013 and 2014. According to LEARN, it meant to, but did not, submit\n\nthe 2013 audit as part of its proposal while the 2014 audit had not yet been completed at the time\n\n\n                                              - 10 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nof the submission. Regarding the school’s projected budget, LEARN stated that it had recently\n\nauthorized funding of up to $1 million in start-up costs for the campus and secured commitments\n\nfor donations from five donors, which were listed, for approximately $8 million over five years.\n\nLEARN further updated its original budget to include a food service plan and disputed District\n\n60’s concerns over the sufficiency of its funding plan for special education students.\n\n¶ 30   Concerning the financial impact on District 60, LEARN asserted that, as of the 2013\n\nfiscal year, the district had a fund balance of $37 million, which was higher than the 2011 or\n\n2012 fiscal years. Additionally, LEARN highlighted that District 60 had approximately $36\n\nmillion of cash on hand, or 75 days’ worth, an amount which had been increasing over the past\n\nyears. LEARN further highlighted that, between 2011 and 2013, District 60 had operated at a\n\nsurplus every year with its revenues growing every year. LEARN’s data also showed that\n\nDistrict 60’s surplus had decreased each year since 2011 and was approximately $2 million as of\n\n2013. Based on District 60’s alleged “robust” financial position, LEARN concluded that, even\n\nwhen considering its request for funding at a 100% per capita tuition charge, its Waukegan\n\ncampus would represent 1% to 2% of District 60’s budget and the district would maintain its\n\n“strong financial” position and remain “financially solvent” with the school’s presence.\n\n¶ 31   Additionally, LEARN acknowledged that, if it was successful on appeal, its school would\n\nnot be part of District 60 but rather its own local educational agency. Consequently, LEARN\n\nstated that it had conversations with charter schools that were operating as local educational\n\nagencies, reviewed revenue data from charter schools authorized by the Commission, and\n\nobtained further guidance from its legal counsel. LEARN asserted that it was prepared to\n\ndedicate the resources necessary to be fully responsible for the instruction of special education\n\nand ELL students and the transportation of its students. LEARN provided corresponding plans\n\n\n                                               - 11 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\non these matters and submitted a revised budget to include the added expenses, including line\n\nitems on transportation, food service and special education services.\n\n¶ 32    District 60 responded to LEARN’s memorandum, arguing that, even when considering\n\nthe new information on appeal, the proposal still did not satisfy the criteria enumerated in the\n\nCharter Schools Law, specifically as it related to serving special education, ELL, and at-risk\n\nstudents; the fiscal capability of LEARN to operate the school; and the financial impact on the\n\ndistrict. District 60 also highlighted that, while the proposed location at 800 South Genesee\n\nStreet had been “described positively,” there was no evidence that an architect had reviewed the\n\nfacility and determined whether a school could operate there. Furthermore, District 60 posited\n\nthat LEARN did not sufficiently address whether the location could meet the transportation or\n\nfood service needs of the school. District 60 also included a report prepared by Dr. Benjamin\n\nDitkowsky, which was based on data from the Illinois Report Card. 2 Dr. Ditkowsky’s report\n\nacknowledged that the academic performance of LEARN’s students “appear[ed] impressive” but\n\ncould be explained by variables unique to its schools. In particular, the report noted a high rate of\n\nattrition of LEARN’s students as they matriculated through school grades, suggesting that the\n\nstudents who left the schools were academically inferior to those who remained. Additionally,\n\nthe report found that the level of chronic truancy, i.e., missing 10 days or more of school the\n\nprior year, at LEARN’s schools was more than twice the rate of District 60’s schools and more\n\nthan three to four times the statewide average, suggesting that this level of truancy led to lower\n\ntest participation and higher test scores, as those who took the test were academically superior to\n\nthose who did not.\n        2\n          The Illinois Report Card is a compilation of data published annually by ISBE showing how\nindividual schools, school districts and the state as a whole are performing on a variety of academic\nperformance measures, as well as providing the demographic composition of the schools, districts, and\nthe state. 105 ILCS 5/10-17a (West 2014).\n\n                                                 - 12 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 33   LEARN responded to the critiques of its academic success, asserting that the “mobility\n\nrate,” a statistic measuring the percentage of students who transfer in and out of a school, for its\n\nChicago schools was lower than District 60’s schools for each of the past five years and lower\n\nthan the statewide average for four of the last five years. LEARN acknowledged that its North\n\nChicago school had a high mobility rate, but explained that the school, and the North Chicago\n\nCommunity Unit School District 187 as a whole, had a high percentage of military families who\n\nrelocated often as part of their careers. Furthermore, LEARN acknowledged that the Illinois\n\nReport Card showed that over one-third of its Chicago students were chronically truant but noted\n\nthat its “[a]ttendance data,” also from the Illinois Report Card, showed that its Chicago students\n\nattended school at a higher rate than students in District 60 and the statewide average. LEARN\n\nstated that the “discrepancy” between its chronic truancy and attendance data was “severe” and\n\nwould be “investigate[d].”\n\n¶ 34   On March 12, 2015, the Commission, as part of its due diligence process, held interviews\n\nwith several representatives of LEARN and several representatives of District 60.\n\n¶ 35   Four days later, Dr. Michael Anderson, an education consultant with the Lake County\n\nRegional Office of Education, issued a report on whether the facility located at 800 South\n\nGenesee Street could pass various safety and health codes. Dr. Anderson observed that the\n\nfacility was “clean,” was well-maintained, and had “many facilities that one would find in a\n\nregular public school,” such as a large gymnasium, offices, a cafeteria, a kitchen, and several\n\nclassrooms. Although Dr. Anderson determined that the building met the safety and health codes\n\nin several respects, he also found that “a few stairways” did not, some floor tiles “probably\n\ncontain[ed] asbestos,” and certain windows would need to be modified to “allow for quick and\n\neasy escape.” Dr. Anderson also noted issues with the parking lot and the size of the classrooms.\n\n\n                                               - 13 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 36   On March 30, 2015, an employee of LEARN e-mailed the Commission, stating that it\n\nwas no longer considering the facility at 2634 Grand Avenue due to necessary renovations being\n\ntoo costly. The employee stated that the other three locations were still viable options for the\n\nschool but highlighted 800 South Genesee Street as the preferred site and noted an architectural\n\nreview of the facility revealed that the location would be able to open in the fall of 2015 despite\n\n“some items” needing “attention.”\n\n¶ 37   The next day, the Commission held a public hearing. According to a summary of the\n\nhearing, 105 people signed in to support LEARN while 80 signed in to support District 60.\n\nAmong the people who spoke at the hearing, 28 supported LEARN while 29 supported District\n\n60. During the week following the hearing, the Commission received 40 e-mails in support of\n\nLEARN and 32 e-mails in support of District 60.\n\n¶ 38   On April 9, 2015, IFF Real Estate Services, LLC (IFF) submitted a “desk review” in\n\nresponse to the Commission’s request to assess the feasibility of having a charter school located\n\nat 800 South Genesee Street and 2700 North Belvidere Road. In order to render the assessment,\n\nIFF reviewed various documentation, including an analysis performed by an architecture firm on\n\neach of the properties, LEARN’s memorandum on appeal, and a proposed term sheet for 800\n\nSouth Genesee Street. Concerning 800 South Genesee Street, although IFF generally concluded\n\nthat the building could be converted to accommodate a charter school, it required clarification on\n\nthe square footage of the building, noting a discrepancy between LEARN’s memorandum on\n\nappeal and the proposed term sheet. IFF determined that, if the square footage of the term sheet\n\nwas correct, LEARN would eventually outgrow the facility, but the facility would be a “good\n\noption” if LEARN reduced its proposed student population or increased the size of the facility.\n\nConcerning 2700 North Belvidere Road, IFF concluded that the facility could be converted to\n\n\n                                              - 14 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\naccommodate the charter school but that it would likely require more funding than the $750,000\n\nLEARN had initially allocated.\n\n¶ 39   On April 15, 2015, the Commission’s staff issued a report, recommending that the\n\nCommission grant LEARN’s appeal with a funding level of 91% of District 60’s per capita\n\ntuition charge. The report noted that the academic performance in LEARN’s schools was “very\n\nstrong” and highlighted that, in 2013 ISAT testing for low-income students in mathematics and\n\nreading, LEARN’s schools outperformed all of District 60’s schools except for one “admissions­\n\nbased magnet school.” Additionally, in 2014 ISAT testing, LEARN’s schools outperformed\n\nDistrict 60’s schools “in all tested subjects overall, and for low-income/at-risk students.” With\n\nregard to ELL students, although LEARN had a small population of them at its schools, those\n\nattending LEARN North Chicago, a location demographically similar to Waukegan, significantly\n\noutperformed both District 60 and the statewide average in reading and mathematics scores in\n\n2014 ISAT testing. The report also indicated that “independent analyses by outside experts\n\nconfirm LEARN’s academic data and do not support [District 60’s] challenges,” specifically\n\nciting Dr. Ditkowsky’s analysis.\n\n¶ 40   Concerning LEARN’s finances, the report concluded that it had “a 14-year track record\n\nof running a financially sound network of charter schools.” The report found that District 60’s\n\nexpenses and revenues had risen during the past three years, and although its net income had\n\nbeen declining each year, its cash on hand had increased. The report noted that District 60’s\n\nenrollment had been “accelerating,” which would “significantly offset” the loss of students to the\n\ncharter school. The report concluded that, contrary to District 60’s claim, the district was not\n\n“likely to suffer economic hardship” if the Commission granted LEARN’s appeal with funding\n\nat 91% of the district’s per capita tuition charge, the staff’s recommended award, or even 100%.\n\n\n                                              - 15 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 41   Concerning LEARN’s facility plan, the report highlighted that LEARN had built or\n\nremodeled four campuses in the past decade. The report found that LEARN had “experience\n\nnegotiating contracts, obtaining zoning and permits and incentivizing contractors to timely”\n\ncomplete their projects. The report observed that LEARN had identified a total of four locations\n\nfor the school, two in its proposal to District 60 and two on appeal to the Commission, but as of\n\nApril 2015, LEARN had focused on 800 South Genesee Street and 2700 North Belvidere Road.\n\nHowever, the report noted that, given the material available on appeal, independent financial and\n\nconstruction evaluators could not determine whether LEARN would be able to open the\n\nWaukegan campus on time. The report further observed that LEARN did not have much\n\nexperience with ELL or Hispanic students and had never operated a school as a local educational\n\nagency. However, the report concluded that, due to LEARN’s experience and “track record” of\n\nsuccess at its other eight schools, it should have the opportunity to replicate its success in\n\nWaukegan. Although the staff recommended granting LEARN’s appeal, it suggested that,\n\nbecause of the “limited time for opening in September, 2015,” the grant should be contingent on\n\nLEARN satisfying a performance agreement that required it to “finalize its facility plan, pre­\n\nopening budget, and timeline” by May 15, 2015.\n\n¶ 42   Leading up to the Commission’s scheduled public meeting, in which it would vote on\n\nLEARN’s appeal, set to begin in the afternoon of April 21, 2015, its staff met with\n\nrepresentatives from LEARN and District 60. The staff informed the parties that its\n\nrecommendation was to grant LEARN’s appeal subject to the performance agreement.\n\n¶ 43   On the morning of April 21, 2015, the Commission e-mailed the parties with several\n\nattachments, including one where the Commission requested District 60 to provide “any\n\nevidence and/or verification” on its assertions that it would suffer grievous financial harm if the\n\n\n                                              - 16 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nappeal was granted. That document also informed the parties that two of the Commissioners\n\nwould participate in the meeting by telephone. Another attachment, which was a recommended\n\nmotion to grant LEARN’s appeal, stated that LEARN would be allowed to satisfy the conditions\n\nof the performance agreement by July 1, 2015, rather than May 15, 2015.\n\n¶ 44   Shortly after receiving this e-mail, District 60’s general counsel, Thomas Morris, replied,\n\nobjecting to the Commission’s request for additional evidence of financial harm because of the\n\nshort notice. Morris asserted that additional evidence existed but was impossible to gather by the\n\ntime of the meeting. Morris also complained that it was unfair LEARN would have additional\n\ntime to satisfy the conditions of the performance agreement while District 60 had been required\n\nto meet its deadlines. Morris argued that extending the deadlines to only one party showed that\n\nthe Commission was biased and acting “arbitrar[ily] and capricious[ly].”\n\n¶ 45                          F. The Commission’s Public Meeting\n\n¶ 46   On April 21, 2015, at 3:05 p.m., Greg Richmond, the chairman of the Commission, took\n\nroll call. Seven of the commissioners were physically present while two others appeared\n\ntelephonically, with their telephonic presence being approved unanimously by motion. After\n\ntending to a separate matter on the agenda, the Commission heard public comments on\n\nLEARN’s appeal. Thereafter, the Commission discussed reports from Richmond, its various\n\ncommittees, its legal counsel, and its interim executive director. Commissioner Bill Farmer then\n\nmade a motion for the Commission to hold a closed session “for the expressed purpose of\n\nconsidering the following subject, consideration of evidence by the Commission or a committee\n\nof the Commission as a quasi-[adjudicative] body.” The motion passed unanimously, and the\n\nCommission adjourned into a closed session.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 17 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 47   When the Commission returned to an open session, it began consideration of LEARN’s\n\nappeal. Hosanna Mahaley-Jones, the interim executive director of the Commission, gave a\n\npresentation summarizing the staff’s recommendation to grant LEARN’s appeal and its two key\n\nreasons: (1) “performance” and (2) “capacity.” First, she highlighted that, in ISAT testing,\n\nLEARN’s schools generally outperformed District 60’s schools overall and for low-income\n\nstudents, at-risk students, ELL students, students with disabilities, black students, and Hispanic\n\nstudents. Second, Mahaley-Jones observed that LEARN had a lengthy track record “of running\n\nfinancially sound schools,” and although LEARN would be operating as a local educational\n\nagency for the first time, it had “the capacity” to do so. She also addressed District 60’s concerns\n\nabout the proposed school and deemed them unwarranted.\n\n¶ 48   Following Mahaley-Jones’s presentation, LEARN gave a presentation and requested that\n\nit be funded at 100% of District 60’s per capita tuition charge, arguing that anything less would\n\nresult in drastic consequences for the proposed school. District 60 also gave a presentation, in\n\nwhich its outside counsel responded to many of the statements made by Mahaley-Jones and\n\nLEARN in their presentations. District 60’s counsel further informed the Commission that it\n\ncould not “sufficiently respond” to the request for additional evidence of financial harm due to\n\nits receipt of the request on such short notice. Counsel concluded that LEARN’s proposal was\n\nnot in the best interests of the students the school was designed to serve for various reasons,\n\nincluding that LEARN lacked a viable facility to house the school and was not prepared to\n\nundertake the responsibilities required of a local educational agency.\n\n¶ 49   The commissioners subsequently asked questions of LEARN and District 60’s\n\nrepresentatives and held their own discussions of various issues, including the impact of funding\n\nthe school at 91% versus 100% of the district’s per capita tuition charge and about LEARN’s\n\n\n                                               - 18 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\npreferred location of 800 South Genesee Street. Eventually, the commissioners voted 5-4 to grant\n\nLEARN’s appeal to establish the Waukegan charter school at a funding level of 100% of District\n\n60’s per capita tuition charge provided that, by July 1, 2015, LEARN had to (1) execute a facility\n\nlease, (2) obtain approval from the Commission’s staff on a facility plan that would allow the\n\nWaukegan campus to open by September 15, 2015, and (3) obtain approval from the\n\nCommission’s staff on a revised budget plan with a 100% funding level.\n\n¶ 50    On April 29, 2015, the Commission sent a report summarizing its vote to ISBE.\n\n¶ 51                            G. The Commission’s Written Decision\n\n¶ 52    The next day, the Commission sent LEARN and District 60 its final written decision. In\n\nthe decision, the Commission discussed several aspects of LEARN’s proposal. Concerning the\n\nfacility plan, the Commission noted that LEARN initially proposed locating its Waukegan\n\ncampus at either 2634 Grand Avenue or 2700 North Belvidere Road, but observed that LEARN\n\nlater amended the proposal to include facilities located at 800 South Genesee Street and 202\n\nNorth Genesee Street. The Commission found that LEARN identified “three viable facilities,” all\n\nbut the 2634 Grand Avenue facility, and noted that the Charter Schools Law only required an\n\napplicant to identify two facilities.\n\n¶ 53    Concerning LEARN’s finances, the Commission observed that LEARN’s assets were\n\n$14.8 million while its liabilities were $6.8 million and that LEARN projected a positive net\n\nincome for the first five years of the Waukegan campus. The Commission noted that LEARN’s\n\nWaukegan budget contained a 3% contingency and found that LEARN had appropriate internal\n\nfinancial controls and reporting mechanisms. Furthermore, the Commission highlighted that\n\nLEARN had raised over $3 million each year since 2012 and had secured enough funding to\n\nsupport the school’s start-up costs. The Commission further highlighted that it had a precedent of\n\n                                              - 19 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nfunding Commission-authorized charter schools at 100% of the local school district’s per capita\n\ntuition charge and determined that amount to be the appropriate level of funding for the\n\nWaukegan school. The Commission asserted that a 100% funding level “did not materially\n\nharm” District 60 or impact its financial solvency, as LEARN’s impact on the district’s total\n\nbudget would range from less than 1% in 2016 to slightly more than 2% in 2020. Based on the\n\nevidence before it, the Commission concluded that LEARN’s proposed Waukegan campus\n\ncomplied with the Charter Schools Law.\n\n¶ 54   The Commission next analyzed if the proposal was in the best interests of the students the\n\nschool was designed to serve, observing that its analysis focused on the sufficiency of LEARN’s\n\neducational plan, organizational plan, and business plan and its capacity to execute. The\n\nCommission highlighted the superior academic performance of LEARN’s students compared to\n\nDistrict 60’s students, but acknowledged that LEARN’s experience with ELL students was\n\n“limited.” Nevertheless, the Commission noted that LEARN’s ELL students “greatly\n\noutperformed” the students in District 60 and statewide in reading and mathematics test scores.\n\nMoreover, the Commission asserted that LEARN’s organizational plan, business plan and\n\ncapacity to execute “met or exceeded the standards required.” All told, the Commission\n\ndetermined that the proposal was in the best interests of the students the school was designed to\n\nserve. Accordingly, the Commission granted LEARN’s appeal and reversed District 60’s denial\n\nsubject to LEARN satisfying the conditions of the performance agreement.\n\n¶ 55                             H. Post-Decision Proceedings\n\n¶ 56   Approximately two months later, LEARN submitted the documentation required by the\n\nperformance agreement, including a lease for a building located at 540 South McAlister Avenue\n\nin Waukegan, a facility plan with a renovation schedule, and a revised budget. On July 1, 2015,\n\n\n                                             - 20 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthe Commission’s staff issued a compliance report, finding that LEARN had complied with all of\n\nthe requirements of the performance agreement. Consequently, on that same day, LEARN and\n\nthe Commission executed a charter agreement for a term of five years. The Commission\n\nsubsequently informed ISBE of the agreement. Over the next two months, LEARN worked with\n\nISBE to clarify and correct some issues with the charter agreement. Ultimately, on August 27,\n\n2015, ISBE certified the charter.\n\n¶ 57                                I. Circuit Court Proceedings\n\n¶ 58   On June 4, 2015, District 60 filed a complaint in the circuit court against the\n\nCommission, ISBE, and LEARN, alleging four counts. Count I sought administrative review\n\nagainst all three defendants and alleged that the Commission’s decision to grant LEARN’s\n\nappeal was clearly erroneous because LEARN failed to (1) provide two viable facilities for the\n\ncharter school, (2) propose an adequate educational plan for the school, in particular for ELL\n\nstudents and students with disabilities, (3) submit a complete description of the governance and\n\noperations of the school, (4) demonstrate how it would meet the needs of Waukegan’s high\n\npopulation of at-risk students, and (5) provide sufficient evidence to show that the terms of the\n\ncharter were economically sound for both the school and District 60. In addition, District 60\n\nclaimed that the Commission’s decision was “late and unlawful” because it e-mailed ISBE the\n\nvote summary “after 5:00 p.m. on April 30th,” or “after the close of business on the seventh day\n\nafter the Commission’s meeting approving the charter school.” Further, District 60 alleged that\n\nthe Commission set conditions under which it would approve LEARN’s appeal “without the\n\nlegal authority to do so” and had “exceed[ed] its jurisdiction” when it gave LEARN until July 1,\n\n2015, to satisfy the performance agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 59    Count II alleged that the Commission violated the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/1\n\net seq. (West 2014)) when it allowed two commissioners to participate telephonically without\n\nprior notice and a lawful justification. Count III alleged that the Commission violated the Open\n\nMeetings Act (id.) by holding a closed session without identifying a proper exception. Lastly,\n\ncount IV sought a declaratory judgment against all three defendants, seeking a declaration that\n\nthe Commission’s decision was clearly erroneous.\n\n¶ 60    Approximately a week later, District 60 filed an unsuccessful emergency motion to stay\n\nthe final decision of the Commission pending resolution of its lawsuit. Eventually, on June 23,\n\n2016, following several motions being filed and various briefings, the circuit court affirmed the\n\nCommission’s decision to grant LEARN’s appeal and dismissed counts II, III and IV of District\n\n60’s complaint, finding that administrative review was the sole means for District 60 to obtain\n\nrelief and the counts were “duplicative of the relief sought by way of administrative review.”\n\nDistrict 60 timely appealed. 3,4\n\n¶ 61                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 62                              A. Compliance With Supreme Court Rules\n\n¶ 63    Initially, we must address ISBE and the Commission’s contention that District 60’s\n\nopening brief violated our supreme court rules in multiple respects. While we agree that District\n\n60 violated multiple rules by not providing a citation to authority for its purported standard of\n\n\n        3\n           District 60’s notice of appeal stated that it was appealing from the circuit court’s June 23, 2016,\norder that affirmed the Commission’s decision but also from the court’s order that denied the district’s\nemergency motion for a stay. However, District 60 has not raised any arguments on appeal related to this\nmotion. Accordingly, any argument concerning the propriety of the denial of the motion has been\nforfeited on appeal. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017); Goldberg v. Rush University Medical\nCenter, 371 Ill. App. 3d 597, 604 (2007).\n         4\n           Although LEARN is a party to this appeal, it has not filed any briefs nor has it moved to adopt\nthe joint briefs of the Commission and ISBE.\n\n                                                    - 22 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nreview (Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(3) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017)), copiously arguing and failing to provide\n\nappropriate references in several places to the record on appeal in its statement of facts (Ill. S. Ct.\n\nR. 341(h)(6) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017)), and neglecting to include a complete appendix with the\n\nrequired documents (Ill. S. Ct. R. 342 (eff. July 1, 2017)), we disagree with ISBE and the\n\nCommission that we should sanction these violations by dismissing District 60’s appeal or\n\nstriking its brief. Such punishments are permissible for violating the supreme court rules, but\n\nthey are particularly harsh. North Community Bank v. 17011 South Park Ave., LLC, 2015 IL App\n\n(1st) 133672, ¶ 14. Although we do not find such a punitive sanction warranted in this case, we\n\nwill disregard any arguments raised by District 60 in its statement of facts and consider only\n\nthose properly raised in the argument section of its brief. Thus, despite District 60’s\n\nnoncompliance with the rules, we nevertheless consider the merits of its appeal.\n\n¶ 64                           B. Jurisdiction of the Commission and ISBE\n\n¶ 65   District 60 first contends that the Commission and ISBE lost jurisdiction over LEARN’s\n\nappeal and certification because they both failed to follow the timeline established by the Charter\n\nSchools Law.\n\n¶ 66   The Charter Schools Law outlines the timeline in which various actions by the\n\nCommission and ISBE should occur. 105 ILCS 5/27A-1 et seq. (West 2014). Following a public\n\nhearing on a charter school applicant’s appeal, the Commission has 30 days to vote to either\n\ngrant or deny the appeal, which must occur at a public meeting. Id. §§ 27A-8(e), (g). The statute\n\nthen provides that:\n\n       “Within 7 days of the public meeting ***, the [Commission] shall file a report\n\n       with [ISBE] granting or denying the proposal. If the [Commission] has approved\n\n       the proposal, within 30 days of receipt of the [Commission’s] report, [ISBE] shall\n\n                                                - 23 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n       determine whether the approved charter proposal is consistent with the provisions\n\n       of [the Charter Schools Law] and, if the approved proposal complies, certify the\n\n       proposal ***.” Id. § 27A-8(f), (g).\n\nAlthough section 27A-8(f) of the Charter Schools Law provides a timeline with respect to a local\n\nschool board’s approval of a charter school, section 27A-8(g) makes clear that the timeline\n\nimposed in section 27A-8(f) applies equally to when the Commission considers an appeal of a\n\ncharter school denial by the school board. See id. § 27A-8(g) (“[T]he Commission shall follow\n\nthe same process and be subject to the same timelines for review as the local school board.”).\n\n¶ 67   The parties do not dispute the timeline of events in this case. On April 21, 2015, the\n\nCommission voted at a public meeting to grant LEARN’s appeal. Eight days later, on April 29,\n\n2015, the Commission submitted the report of its vote to ISBE, who ultimately certified the\n\ncharter between LEARN and the Commission on August 27, 2015, well after the outlined 30-day\n\ntime period. According to District 60, the Commission’s noncompliance with the 7-day reporting\n\ncommand and ISBE’s noncompliance with the 30-day certification command resulted in them\n\nlosing jurisdiction over LEARN’s appeal and rendering them unable to reverse District 60’s\n\ndenial and certify the charter school, respectively. Furthermore, District 60 argues that the\n\nCommission and ISBE’s failure to comply with the timeline prejudiced the district because it\n\ncreated uncertainty in its staffing, enrollment, and budget. The Commission and ISBE respond,\n\narguing that they did not lose jurisdiction over LEARN’s appeal and certification because the\n\nstatutory language is merely directory, not mandatory.\n\n¶ 68   Whether a statutory command is directory or mandatory is a question involving statutory\n\nconstruction that we review de novo. In re M.I., 2013 IL 113776, ¶ 15. “When construing a\n\nstatute, our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent, the surest and\n\n\n                                               - 24 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nmost reliable indicator of which is the statutory language itself, given its plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning.” Id. If a “statute expressly prescribes a consequence for failure to obey a statutory\n\nprovision, that is very strong evidence the legislature intended that consequence to be\n\nmandatory.” People v. Robinson, 217 Ill. 2d 43, 54 (2005). Therefore, under the mandatory-\n\ndirectory dichotomy of statutory construction, it is not the use of obligatory language, such as the\n\nword “shall,” that determines whether a statutory command is mandatory or directory, but rather\n\nwhether noncompliance with such language dictates a resulting consequence. Id.\n\n¶ 69   When a procedural command to a government entity is at issue, we begin with the\n\npresumption that the command is directory. People v. Geiler, 2016 IL 119095, ¶ 18. This\n\npresumption may be overcome, and thus the procedural command read as mandatory, if “(1)\n\nnegative language in the statute or rule prohibits further action in the case of noncompliance or\n\n(2) the right the statute or rule is designed to protect would generally be injured under a directory\n\nreading.” Id. “It has long been held that statutory requisitions directed to government officials\n\ndesigned to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings are usually directory rather than\n\nmandatory.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Robinson, 217 Ill. 2d at 56. But if these\n\nrequisitions “are intended for the protection of the citizen, *** and by a disregard of which his\n\nrights might be and generally would be injuriously affected, they are not directory but\n\nmandatory.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. If the procedural command is deemed\n\nmandatory and the government entity fails to comply with the required act, we must invalidate\n\nthe government action. In re M.I., 2013 IL 113776, ¶ 16.\n\n¶ 70   In this case, we begin with the presumption that the procedural commands at issue—the\n\nCommission’s 7-day reporting command and ISBE’s 30-day certification command—are\n\ndirectory rather than mandatory. District 60 has failed to overcome this presumption. First,\n\n\n                                               - 25 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nsection 27A-8 of the Charter Schools Law (105 ILCS 5/27A-8 (West 2014)) does not utilize any\n\nnegative language prohibiting further action in the case of noncompliance nor does this section\n\ndictate a particular consequence for either the Commission or ISBE’s failure to comply with the\n\ncommands. Notably, District 60 fails to identify any language, seemingly conceding this point.\n\n¶ 71   Second, before analyzing whether a directory reading would generally injure the right the\n\nstatutory provision is designed to protect, we must determine what right the provision protects.\n\nSee In re M.I., 2013 IL 113776, ¶ 24. Our review of the legislative history of the Charter Schools\n\nLaw does not reveal an explicit right to be protected by the Commission’s 7-day reporting\n\ncommand or ISBE’s 30-day certification command. District 60, however, suggests that the\n\ntimeline is intended to protect impacted school districts and their students from uncertainty in\n\nstaffing, enrollment, and budgetary matters that result from delayed proceedings. District 60’s\n\nargument is true to a degree, as this timeline helps give local school districts, whose funding and\n\nenrollment are necessarily affected by the existence of charter schools in their districts, clarity.\n\nThe same could be said for charter school applicants themselves, who similarly have to budget\n\nlimited resources and also need clarity in the resolution of their proposals. While clarity to the\n\nparties may be a partial benefit of the timeline in the Charter Schools Law, it is only ancillary to\n\nthe true purpose of the timeline, which is to provide guidance to government officials to help\n\nexpedite proceedings and keep them moving in an orderly process. In other words, the timeline\n\ndoes not protect a specific right but rather helps ensure that the proceedings do not become\n\nunnecessarily delayed.\n\n¶ 72   Nevertheless, even giving credence to District 60’s argument that the timeline is designed\n\nto protect school districts from uncertainty in various matters, we disagree that it is a directory\n\nreading that generally causes this uncertainty. Regardless of a directory or mandatory reading of\n\n\n                                               - 26 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthe statutory timeline, there will always be uncertainty. That is simply the nature of the\n\nCommission’s appeals process or any other unresolved proceeding. The uncertainty cannot be\n\nremoved until an appeal or proceeding is resolved. Thus, District 60’s alleged uncertainty has\n\nnothing to do with a directory or mandatory reading of the statutory timeline but rather is\n\ninherent in unresolved proceedings. To the extent that District 60 argues that a directory reading\n\nexacerbates this uncertainty above and beyond the normal uncertainty produced by unresolved\n\nproceedings, we also disagree. Had the Commission missed its 7-day reporting command and\n\nISBE missed its 30-day certification command much earlier in the calendar year, for example in\n\nJanuary and February, District 60 would have no basis for arguing that these missed deadlines\n\nsomehow caused any exacerbated uncertainty for its subsequent year’s staffing, enrollment, or\n\nbudget.\n\n¶ 73      It is only because the missed deadlines occurred much closer to the beginning of the\n\nschool year that this alleged uncertainty in District 60’s operations manifested itself. Thus, while\n\nin this specific case, a directory reading of the statutory timeline might have injured a right the\n\nprovision was designed to protect, District 60 fails to convince us that this holds true under\n\ngeneral circumstances. See, e.g., Geiler, 2016 IL 119095, ¶ 23 (finding that “a defendant may be\n\nprejudiced by a Rule 552 violation if there is a lengthy delay in transmitting a citation in a given\n\ncase, but no reason exists to believe that would generally be true”); Robinson, 217 Ill. 2d at 57\n\n(finding that, “[w]hile the right to appeal might be injured by untimely service in a given case,\n\nthere is no reason to believe that it generally would be”). Moreover, District 60’s assertion that it\n\nwas prejudiced from the Commission and ISBE’s failure to comply with the timeline is belied by\n\nthe fact that it knew the Commission had voted to grant LEARN’s appeal on April 21, 2015,\n\nsubject to LEARN satisfying the performance agreement, well in advance of the beginning of the\n\n\n                                               - 27 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n2015-2016 school year. Consequently, we find that the Commission’s 7-day reporting command\n\nand ISBE’s 30-day certification command are directory.\n\n¶ 74   Furthermore, District 60’s reliance on McReynolds v. Civil Service Comm’n, 18 Ill. App.\n\n3d 1062 (1974), is unpersuasive. In that case, the plaintiff, a state employee, was suspended\n\nwithout pay and two weeks later received a notice of discharge. Id. at 1063. The plaintiff\n\nsubsequently sought a hearing on the matter, which occurred 47 days later. Id. Following the\n\nhearing, a hearing officer recommended that the plaintiff be discharged, a recommendation that\n\nwas eventually adopted by the Civil Service Commission. Id. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a\n\ncomplaint for administrative review, arguing that the Civil Service Commission lost jurisdiction\n\nover her case because it failed to hold the hearing within 30 days of her request. Id. The statutory\n\nprovision at issue stated that, “ ‘[u]pon the filing of such a request for a hearing, the Commission\n\nshall grant a hearing within thirty days.’ ” (Emphasis omitted.) Id. at 1064 (quoting Ill. Rev. Stat.\n\n1971, ch. 127, ¶ 63b111). The circuit court agreed with the plaintiff and reversed the decision of\n\nthe Civil Service Commission. Id. at 1063. The Civil Service Commission appealed, arguing that\n\nthe 30-day command was directory, not mandatory. Id. at 1063-64.\n\n¶ 75   This court observed that the purpose of the statutory provision at issue was to provide\n\n“employees certain procedural protections when they were being considered for discharge,\n\ndemotion or suspension,” namely “a timely hearing and a speedy adjudication of disciplinary\n\ncharges.” Id. at 1065. To this end, the time limitation not only ensured “fairness to the employee\n\nbut serve[d] to prevent the employee from suffering monetary injury.” Id. at 1066. In other\n\nwords, without a mandatory reading, the employee would be unable to collect a salary, which\n\nwould always result in a direct monetary injury. Id. Thus, we found the statutory timeline was\n\nmandatory. Id. at 1067.\n\n\n                                               - 28 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 76   In contrast to McReynolds, where the timeline was intended for the protection of the\n\nemployee, in this case, the timeline is designed to ensure order and efficiency in the proceedings\n\nrather than protect a specific right. Furthermore, even accepting District 60’s argument that the\n\ntimeline is designed to protect school districts from uncertainty in various matters, the district\n\nhas only shown that a directory reading of the timeline would, in certain circumstances, injure a\n\nright the provision is designed to protect. However, in McReynolds, a directory reading of the\n\ntimeline at issue would always injure the right the provision was designed to protect.\n\nAccordingly, because the Commission’s 7-day reporting command and ISBE’s 30-day\n\ncertification command are directory, the Commission did not lose jurisdiction over LEARN’s\n\nappeal and ISBE did not lose jurisdiction over the certification of LEARN’s charter.\n\n¶ 77                          C. The Propriety of the Commission’s Decision\n\n¶ 78   District 60 next contends that, because LEARN’s proposal and supplemental information\n\non appeal did not satisfy the requirements of the Charter Schools Law, the Commission’s\n\ndecision to grant LEARN’s appeal was improper. Specifically, District 60 argues that LEARN’s\n\nproposal did not (1) identify two viable locations for the school, (2) demonstrate that the terms of\n\nthe proposed charter were economically sound for the district and the school, (3) include an\n\neducational program sufficient to meet the needs of students in the district, in particular ELL and\n\nspecial education students, (4) demonstrate the capability to meet the needs of at-risk students,\n\nand (5) demonstrate it was in the best interests of the students the school was designed to serve.\n\n¶ 79   Pursuant to the Charter Schools Law, the Commission could reverse District 60’s denial\n\nof LEARN’s proposal if it found the proposal was “in compliance with [the law]” and “in the\n\nbest interests of the students the charter school” was designed to serve. 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h)\n\n(West 2014). To be in compliance with the Charter Schools Law, a proposal must, inter alia,\n\n\n                                               - 29 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nidentify “at least 2 sites that are potentially available as a charter school facility by the time the\n\ncharter school is to open,” provide “[e]vidence that the terms of the charter as proposed are\n\neconomically sound for both the charter school and the school district,” and provide a description\n\nof the proposed school’s educational program. Id. §§ 27A-7(a)(3), (7), (9). When determining\n\nwhether a proposal is in compliance, the Commission conducts a de novo review, affording no\n\ndeference to the school board’s findings. 23 Ill. Adm. Code 650.110(d)(1) (2012). The\n\nCommission also does not have to rely on only the information contained in the initial proposal\n\nand may accept additional information on appeal. 23 Ill. Adm. Code 650.100(e) (2015). The\n\nCommission’s final decision is reviewable under the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3­\n\n101 et seq. (West 2014)). 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 80   In administrative review, we review the decision and reasoning of the administrative\n\nagency, here the Commission, not that of the circuit court. Doe Three v. Department of Public\n\nHealth, 2017 IL App (1st) 162548, ¶ 25. The applicable standard of review “depends upon\n\nwhether the question presented is one of fact, one of law, or a mixed question of fact and law.”\n\nBeggs v. Board of Education of Murphysboro Community Unit School District No. 186, 2016 IL\n\n120236, ¶ 50. The factual findings of an administrative agency are held as prima facie true and\n\ncorrect (735 ILCS 5/3-110 (West 2014)), and we will not disturb those findings unless they are\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence, which occurs only when “the opposite conclusion is\n\nclearly evident.” Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50. We review pure questions of law de novo. Id.\n\nFinally, mixed questions of law and fact “examine[ ] the legal effect of a given set of facts” or, in\n\nother words, involve whether uncontested facts have satisfied a statutory standard. Id. We review\n\nthese questions under the clearly erroneous standard. Id. Clear error occurs only “when although\n\nthere is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite\n\n\n                                                - 30 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nand firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n\n\nWe will determine the appropriate standard of review for each of District 60’s arguments in our\n\n\ndiscussion on each argument. \n\n\n¶ 81                           1. Location of the Proposed Charter School\n\n\n¶ 82    We begin with District 60’s argument that LEARN’s proposal was deficient because it\n\n\ndid not identify two “viable” locations for the charter school. District 60 asserts that, during the\n\n\nproceedings, facilities that had been identified by LEARN were taken out of consideration for\n\n\nvarious reasons and highlights that the eventual location of the charter school was not even \n\n\namong the locations identified in LEARN’s initial proposal nor the supplemental locations\n\n\nsubmitted to the Commission on appeal. Based on this, District 60 concludes that “LEARN did \n\n\nnot submit even one potential viable site” for the location of the charter school.\n\n\n¶ 83   Under section 27A-7(a)(3) of the Charter Schools Law, the proposal must include:\n\n\n       “A description of and address for the physical plant in which the charter school\n\n       will be located; provided that nothing in the Article shall be deemed to justify\n\n       delaying or withholding favorable action on or approval of a charter school\n\n       proposal because the building or buildings in which the charter school is to be\n\n       located have not been acquired or rented at the time a charter school proposal is\n\n       submitted or approved or a charter school contract is entered into or submitted for\n\n       certification or certified, so long as the proposal or submission identifies and\n\n       names at least 2 sites that are potentially available as a charter school facility by\n\n       the time the charter school is to open.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-7(a)(3) (West 2014).\n\nDistrict 60 does not contest that LEARN identified two sites in its proposal and identified two\n\nadditional sites in its memorandum on appeal to the Commission but rather seemingly contests\n\n                                               - 31 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nwhether these facts satisfied the statutory standard. Thus, we review this issue under the clearly-\n\nerroneous standard. See Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50.\n\n¶ 84   In LEARN’s proposal to District 60, it identified two locations for the charter school, one\n\nat 2634 Grand Avenue and the other at 2700 North Belvidere Road. The proposal provided a\n\ndescription of the locations, discussed the options available for acquiring use of them, and briefly\n\ndetailed the improvements necessary for them to operate as a school. Upon appeal to the\n\nCommission, LEARN provided a memorandum and identified two additional locations, one at\n\n800 South Genesee Street and the other at 202 North Genesee Street. LEARN also provided a\n\ndescription of the locations and briefly detailed the improvements necessary for them to operate\n\nas a school. The memorandum suggested that the newly identified locations were more feasible\n\nthan the ones identified in the proposal to District 60. During the pendency of LEARN’s appeal\n\nbefore the Commission, various documents detailed the feasibility of, and issues associated with,\n\noperating a charter school at the locations identified by LEARN.\n\n¶ 85   Based on this information, the Commission’s written decision observed that, upon further\n\ndue diligence by LEARN on all four locations, 2634 Grand Avenue was no longer viable due to\n\nprohibitive costs and 2700 North Belvidere Road would require a longer conversion process.\n\nDespite the longer conversion process at 2700 North Belvidere Road, the Commission concluded\n\nthat LEARN had still identified “three viable facilities” for the charter school, which satisfied the\n\nrequirement of the Charter Schools Law to identify two sites that were potentially available.\n\n¶ 86   We agree with the Commission that LEARN satisfied the statutory standard. While\n\nLEARN ultimately did not select any of the four locations for the eventual home of its school,\n\nnothing in the Charter Schools Law requires this. Despite District 60’s assertion that, at the time\n\nof the Commission’s public meeting, only the property at 800 South Genesee Street was still\n\n\n                                               - 32 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nbeing considered by LEARN, we do not find it unfathomable that, after a charter school\n\napplicant has identified potential locations, further due diligence would reveal those locations as\n\nunsuitable for a multitude of rational reasons. The critical fact is that, at the time LEARN\n\nsubmitted its proposal to District 60 and at the time it submitted its memorandum to the\n\nCommission on appeal, LEARN had identified at least two locations in each submission that\n\nwere “potentially available,” the only standard the Charter Schools Law requires. See 105 ILCS\n\n5/27A-7(a)(3) (West 2014). Nothing in the record on appeal demonstrates that the locations were\n\nunavailable for use when LEARN proposed them. Therefore, we are not left with a definite and\n\nfirm conviction that the Commission committed a mistake in finding that LEARN satisfied this\n\nstatutory requirement. Accordingly, the Commission’s finding was proper.\n\n¶ 87                                 2. Economic Soundness\n\n¶ 88   District 60 next argues that LEARN failed to demonstrate the terms of the proposed\n\ncharter were economically sound for both the district and the school. Concerning itself, District\n\n60 asserts that, during the public meeting on LEARN’s appeal, the commissioners focused their\n\ndiscussion on the impact on LEARN of funding the school at 91% or 100% of the district’s per\n\ncapita tuition charge, but neglected to discuss how it would impact the district itself. District 60\n\nfurther posits that the record is devoid of any sound economic analysis of the proposed charter\n\nschool’s impact on the district. Concerning LEARN, District 60 asserts that LEARN failed to\n\ndemonstrate that it was fiscally capable of operating a school in Waukegan, especially in light of\n\nthe additional responsibilities it would have as a local educational agency.\n\n¶ 89   Before discussing the Charter Schools Law requirement of economic soundness, it is\n\nimportant to understanding generally how a charter school is funded. As previously mentioned, a\n\ncharter school is a tuition-free public school (id. §§ 27A-5(a), (e); Comprehensive Community,\n\n\n                                               - 33 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n216 Ill. 2d at 458), but how the school is funded depends on who is its authorizer. When a local\n\nschool board approves a charter school proposal, it becomes the authorizer. 105 ILCS 5/27A-6(a)\n\n(West 2014). In such cases, part of the funding for the charter school is determined by an\n\nagreement between the local school board and the charter school based on a percentage (at the\n\ntime, 75% to 125%) of the local school district’s per capita tuition charge multiplied by the\n\nnumber of students enrolled in the charter school who reside in the district. Id. § 27A-11(b).\n\n¶ 90   However, when a local school board denies a charter school proposal and the\n\nCommission subsequently grants the appeal, the Commission becomes the school’s authorizer.\n\nId. § 27A-9(f). In such cases, the Commission determines the level of funding, also using a\n\npercentage of the local school district’s per capita tuition charge multiplied by the number of\n\nstudents enrolled in the charter school who reside in the district, but the school obtains the\n\nfunding directly from ISBE. See id. (stating that ISBE “shall withhold from funds otherwise due\n\nthe district the funds authorized by [the Charter Schools Law] to be paid to the charter school\n\nand shall pay such amounts to the charter school”). Thus, regardless of who authorizes the\n\ncharter school, funding that normally would go to a district’s traditional schools is diverted to the\n\ncharter school.\n\n¶ 91   Now turning to District 60’s economic soundness argument, under section 27A-7(a)(9) of\n\nthe Charter Schools Law, a charter school proposal must include “[e]vidence that the terms of the\n\ncharter as proposed are economically sound for both the charter school and the school district.”\n\nId. § 27A-7(a)(9). Although what constitutes economic soundness is not explained in the\n\nregulations, our supreme court has defined the term as meaning “ ‘financial security’ or\n\n‘solvency.’ ” Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 477 (quoting Webster’s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 2177 (1986)). In Comprehensive Community, our supreme court stated\n\n\n                                               - 34 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthat the entity proposing the charter school must not only present evidence that the school would\n\nbe financially sound, but also that the district would remain financially secure and solvent with\n\nthe presence of the charter school. Id. Thus, the local school district’s finances must be\n\nconsidered in any analysis. Id. However, economic soundness “is not a bright-line standard, but\n\nrather a continuum.” Id. at 481. “The terms of some charter school proposals will be more\n\neconomically sound for a school district than other proposals, depending upon their effects on\n\nthe district’s bottom line.” Id.\n\n¶ 92    District 60 does not appear to dispute any of the factual findings of the Commission on its\n\nfinances or LEARN’s but rather asserts that, despite these facts, LEARN’s proposal did not\n\ndemonstrate economic soundness. In this regard, we view the issue presented as a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact, as we must determine whether the established facts have satisfied the\n\nstatutory standard. Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50. On such questions, we review for clear error.\n\nId.; see also Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 477-78 (reviewing for clear error whether\n\na charter school proposal satisfied the economic soundness requirement when the main facts of\n\nthe local school district’s finances were not in dispute). On mixed questions of law and fact, we\n\ngive significant deference to the Commission’s findings, as it has the experience in construing\n\nand applying the Charter Schools Law. Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 472.\n\n¶ 93    In the Commission’s written decision, it found that, based on all of the documentation\n\nsubmitted in the appeal, LEARN had a lengthy track record of operating financially sound\n\ncharter schools, had been successful in fundraising, and its assets exceeded its liabilities.\n\nFurthermore, during the public meeting, LEARN’s CEO, Gregory White, answered questions\n\nfrom the commissioners. One commissioner asked White about LEARN’s cash reserves, and\n\nWhite responded that LEARN had 45 days of cash reserves, which was sufficient to “support any\n\n\n                                              - 35 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nschool that may be falling down, as far as the finances.” The Commission’s written decision also\n\nobserved that LEARN had “put forward a comprehensive plan *** to suggest that it has the\n\noperational capacity” to operate as its own local educational agency and had submitted a\n\nsatisfactory budget to operate as one.\n\n¶ 94   Concerning District 60’s finances, in the Commission’s written decision, it found that\n\nfunding the proposed charter school at 100% of the district’s per capita tuition charge “did not\n\nmaterially harm” District 60 or impact its financial solvency, as LEARN’s impact on the\n\ndistrict’s total budget would range from less than 1% in 2016 to slightly more than 2% in 2020.\n\nMoreover, during the public meeting, one of the commissioners asked if District 60’s 2015\n\nbudget was accurate concerning a $7.3 million deficit in its educational fund and a $2.8 million\n\ndeficit in its operations maintenance fund. A representative of District 60 responded that the\n\nfigures were accurate, adding that the operations maintenance fund included capital costs, which\n\nwould not decrease in the future due to the district’s use of older buildings. The representative\n\nexplained the chief cause of the deficits was decreasing property taxes in the district. She also\n\nstated that, due to these deficits, District 60 had already made various “cuts.” The commissioner\n\npointed out that, in all likelihood due to District 60’s financial position, its per capita tuition\n\ncharge would decrease, which LEARN would need to consider in its own budgetary analysis.\n\nAdditionally during the public meeting, the commissioners spent time addressing issues related\n\nto funding the charter school at 91% and 100% of District 60’s per capita tuition charge and the\n\nimpact on both parties. At one point during the meeting, a commissioner stated “there is\n\nevidence” that funding the charter school at 91% or 100% of District 60’s per capita tuition\n\ncharge “would cause harm to [District 60] *** given [its] financial situation.” The commissioner\n\nadded that this was a “concern” of his.\n\n\n                                              - 36 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 95   In this case, the record plainly shows that the Commission reviewed the relevant financial\n\ninformation and considered not only the financial feasibility of the proposed charter school, as\n\nsupported in part by LEARN, but also District 60’s finances. Critically, we give significant\n\ndeference to the Commission’s findings on these matters, as it has the experience in construing\n\nand applying the Charter Schools Law. See Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 472. This\n\nis so because the Commission is comprised of members who “collectively possess strong\n\nexperience and expertise in public and nonprofit governance, management and finance, public\n\nschool leadership, higher education, assessments, curriculum and instruction, and public\n\neducation law.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-7.5(d) (West 2014). Given the fact that the Commission\n\npossesses the superior knowledge in analyzing the relevant economics of schools compared to\n\nus, nothing in this record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that the Commission\n\ncommitted a mistake in finding that LEARN satisfied the economic-soundness requirement.\n\n¶ 96   Nevertheless, District 60 posits that the Commission failed to complete a “sound\n\neconomic analysis” of the charter school proposal and claims that the Commission’s staff\n\nadmitted as much at the public meeting. At that meeting, Hosanna Mahaley-Jones, the interim\n\nexecutive director of the Commission, informed the commissioners that the staff did not obtain a\n\n“second [financial] analysis with our independent consultants” on LEARN’s proposal, an\n\nanalysis the staff generally obtained in other appeals. However, Mahaley-Jones explained that\n\nthe staff only had a set amount of money “to fund an appeal,” and it had to use those resources to\n\ninvestigate other concerns of District 60, including Dr. Ditkowsky’s analysis of the academic\n\nperformance of LEARN’s schools. Although the staff did not obtain an independent financial\n\nanalysis of LEARN’s proposal, it is clear that, based on Mahaley-Jones’s statements and other\n\nparts of the record, the staff conducted its own detailed financial analysis. District 60’s claim\n\n\n                                              - 37 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\notherwise is therefore without merit. Accordingly, the Commission did not commit clear error\n\nand its finding on economic soundness was proper.\n\n¶ 97                                 3. Educational Program\n\n¶ 98   District 60 next argues that LEARN’s proposed educational program was insufficient to\n\nserve the needs of the students in the district, in particular ELL and special education students.\n\nDistrict 60 asserts that, at the time the Commission held its public meeting, there was no\n\nevidence that LEARN had begun to develop a comprehensive special education program, had the\n\ncapacity to function as its own local educational agency, or had the experience and ability to\n\noperate a robust ELL program. As District 60’s argument essentially contests the factual findings\n\nby the Commission on LEARN’s educational plan, we review this question under the manifest-\n\nweight standard, reversing only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident. See Beggs, 2016 IL\n\n120236, ¶ 50.\n\n¶ 99   Under section 27A-7(a)(5) and (a)(7) of the Charter Schools Law, the charter school\n\nproposal must include “[t]he goals, objectives, and pupil performance standards to be achieved\n\nby the charter school” and “[a] description of the charter school’s educational program, pupil\n\nperformance standards, curriculum, school year, school days, and hours of operation.” 105 ILCS\n\n5/27A-7(a)(5), (7) (West 2014). Furthermore, charter schools must comply with all federal and\n\nstate laws and regulations “applicable to public schools that pertain to special education and the\n\ninstruction of [ELL students].” Id. § 27A-5(g).\n\n¶ 100 LEARN’s original proposal included information about how it would support and enrich\n\nthe learning of traditional students, as well as ELL students and special education students. Upon\n\nappealing to the Commission and realizing that if its appeal was granted, it would operate as its\n\nown local educational agency, LEARN submitted additional information on how it would\n\n                                              - 38 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nsupport ELL and special education students. Based on this information, in the Commission’s\n\nwritten decision, it found that LEARN’s educational plan would follow the Common Core\n\nstandards but would be supplemented with a curriculum that had “been heavily researched” and\n\nshown to have “strong positive growth for all student demographic groups, including\n\neducationally disadvantaged minority, low-income, and ELL populations.” The Commission’s\n\ndecision also stated that, based on LEARN’s proposal and the additional information submitted\n\non appeal, its staff and an independent evaluator visited LEARN’s North Chicago campus,\n\ndirectly observed classroom instruction, and interviewed ELL students and the ELL coordinator.\n\nFrom this, the Commission concluded that the school culture and climate at the North Chicago\n\ncampus were “conducive to learning,” the “academic performance and growth by ELL and\n\nspecial education students” were “proficient,” and the ELL coordinator was “knowledgeable,\n\nexperienced and had a vision for an ELL program across campuses.”\n\n¶ 101 The Commission further found that LEARN would place students requiring “Individual\n\nEducation Plans in the least restrictive environment,” which meant accommodating those\n\nstudents first in the general classroom, but if necessary through “self-contained/resource rooms\n\nwith learning resource teachers.” Additionally, the Commission highlighted that LEARN\n\nemployed “a full range of specialists,” including occupational therapists, physical therapists,\n\nspeech and language therapists, social workers, counselors, and psychologists.\n\n¶ 102 District 60, in essence, asks us to find LEARN’s educational plan, especially as it relates\n\nto ELL and special education students, insufficient despite the Commission, who has the\n\nexpertise and experience in reviewing and evaluating these precise matters, finding the plan\n\nsufficient. When reviewing the findings of fact from an administrative agency, we cannot simply\n\nreweigh the evidence and substitute our judgment in for that of the agency. Abrahamson v.\n\n\n                                             - 39 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nIllinois Department of Professional Regulation, 153 Ill. 2d 76, 88 (1992). Nothing in LEARN’s\n\nproposal or its supplemental information submitted on appeal demonstrates to us that the\n\nopposite conclusion reached by the Commission is clearly evident. Accordingly, the Commission\n\nproperly found that LEARN had proposed a sufficient educational program for its Waukegan\n\ncampus and in particular for ELL and special education students.\n\n¶ 103                                    4. At-Risk Students\n\n¶ 104 District 60 next argues that the Commission did not have adequate support to find that\n\nLEARN would sufficiently serve at-risk students. Specifically, District 60 asserts that the\n\nCommission ignored evidence from the district that the levels of truancy at LEARN’s schools\n\nwere significantly higher than the district and three to four times higher than the statewide\n\naverage. District 60 appears to base this argument on Dr. Ditkowsky’s report, which was based\n\non data from the Illinois Report Card.\n\n¶ 105 In enacting the Charter Schools Law, our legislature declared that one of the law’s\n\npurposes was “[t]o increase learning opportunities for all pupils, with special emphasis on\n\nexpanded learning experiences for at-risk pupils,” which are defined as students “who, because\n\nof physical, emotional, socioeconomic, or cultural factors, [are] less likely to succeed in a\n\nconventional educational environment.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-2(b)(2), 27A-3 (West 2014). As\n\nDistrict 60’s argument contests the factual findings by the Commission on LEARN’s ability to\n\nmeet the needs of at-risk students, we review this question under the manifest-weight standard,\n\nreversing only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident. See Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50.\n\n¶ 106   In the Commission’s written decision, it found that LEARN’s “academic performance\n\noverall is worth special note given that LEARN serves a high-needs student population.” The\n\nCommission also determined that its “staff found that LEARN’s academic performance in its\n\n                                               - 40 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nnetwork of eight existing schools exceeded Waukegan District 60’s performance and that\n\nLEARN’s superior performance could be observed overall, and with respect to low income and\n\nat-risk students.” District 60 essentially argues that, because Dr. Ditkowsky’s report showed a\n\nstatistically higher level of chronic truancy at LEARN’s schools compared to District 60’s\n\nschools and the statewide average, that alone forecloses the possibility that LEARN could\n\nsufficiently serve at-risk students. The Commission did not find that such a conclusion was\n\nwarranted.\n\n¶ 107 First, in a document submitted to the Commission on appeal, LEARN responded to Dr.\n\nDitkowsky’s report, acknowledging that over one-third of its Chicago students had chronic\n\ntruancy, but noted its “[a]ttendance data,” also from the Illinois Report Card, showed its students\n\nattended school at a higher rate than District 60’s students and the statewide average. Here, the\n\nCommission was faced with conflicting evidence on truancy and attendance data, and it was the\n\nCommission’s responsibility to weigh the evidence and resolve the apparent conflict. See\n\nPlowman v. Department of Children & Family Services, 2017 IL App (1st) 160860, ¶ 24. The\n\nCommission did just that, as its decision indicated that its staff “conducted an independent study\n\nto review” the concerns raised in Dr. Ditkowsky’s report. The Commission’s study not only\n\nconcluded that the concerns were unsupported by the data but also “reaffirmed LEARN’s high\n\nquality performance on the vast majority of metrics.”\n\n¶ 108 Second, even if LEARN’s truancy data reflected negatively on its schools, this is only\n\none measure in determining whether a charter school can adequately serve the needs of at-risk\n\nstudents. The Commission’s decision focused primarily on the academic success of LEARN’s\n\nstudents, who, despite being comprised of high populations of at-risk students, generally\n\noutperformed District 60’s students in ISAT testing. Nothing in the record demonstrates to us\n\n\n                                              - 41 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthat an opposite conclusion than that reached by the Commission is clearly evident. Accordingly,\n\nthe Commission properly found that LEARN could sufficiently meet the needs of at-risk students\n\nat its proposed Waukegan campus.\n\n¶ 109                            5. Best Interests of the Students\n\n¶ 110 Although we have rejected District 60’s arguments concerning whether the Commission\n\nproperly found that LEARN’s proposal was in compliance with the statutory requirements of the\n\nCharter Schools Law, the district lastly argues that the Commission erroneously found that\n\nLEARN’s proposal was in the best interests of the students the charter school was intended to\n\nserve. In support, District 60 asserts that, at the Commission’s public meeting, it did not discuss\n\nwhether the proposal was in the best interests of the students and its written decision merely\n\ncontained “boilerplate conclusory statements” on the issue. District 60 posits that the\n\nCommission had no basis for finding the proposal was in the best interests of the students.\n\n¶ 111 As previously discussed, the Commission may only reverse a local school board’s\n\ndecision to deny a charter school proposal if the Commission finds that the proposal (1) “is in\n\ncompliance with” the Charter Schools Law and (2) “in the best interests of the students the\n\ncharter school is designed to serve.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h) (West 2014). Although the\n\nregulations do not expound on this requirement, this court has previously examined the\n\nrequirement by focusing on the overall purpose of the Charter Schools Law, i.e., a means to\n\nprovide alternative public education models that are innovative and flexible. Board of Education\n\nof Rich Township High School District No. 227 v. Illinois State Board of Education, 2011 IL\n\nApp (1st) 110182, ¶¶ 101-104 (citing 105 ILCS 5/27A-2(a)(2) (West 2008)). We review whether\n\nthe Commission properly found LEARN’s proposal was in the best interests of the students it\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 42 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nwas designed to serve for clear error, deferring significantly to the Commission because of its\n\nexperience in construing and applying the statute. Id. ¶ 100.\n\n¶ 112 In the Commission’s written decision, it asserted that LEARN provided evidence that it\n\nhad “the capacity to provide Waukegan public school student[s] with a high quality education\n\noption that is not currently available to them,” especially given LEARN’s demonstrated past\n\nsuccess in operating charter schools. The Commission based this finding on its staff’s\n\n“independent analysis” of LEARN’s proposal, which focused on LEARN’s educational plan,\n\norganizational plan, business plan, and “evidence of capacity.” The staff’s analysis determined\n\nthat the academic success of LEARN’s schools “exceeded Waukegan District 60’s performance\n\nand that LEARN’s superior performance could be observed overall, and with respect to low\n\nincome and at-risk students.” Further, the staff acknowledged that LEARN’s experience with\n\nELL students was limited, but found that the ELL students at its North Chicago campus “greatly\n\noutperformed both Waukegan District 60 and the State ELL reading average.” The staff also\n\nbelieved that LEARN’s organizational plan, business plan and the capacity of LEARN to execute\n\non the plans met or exceeded the standards required by law.\n\n¶ 113 In light of the Commission’s findings, LEARN has demonstrated that the innovation it\n\nimplements into the classroom has resulted in minority and low-income students excelling in\n\nacademic performance as compared to their peer groups. As of the 2013-2014 school year, 72%\n\nof District 60’s students were low-income, 77% were Hispanic and 16% were black. These\n\nstudents deserve the opportunity to attend a school operated by LEARN, an organization that has\n\nproven to be adept at teaching minority and low-income students, improving their academic\n\nperformance, and providing them with the academic foundation and ambition to attend college.\n\nFurthermore, merely because the commissioners never directly discussed the “best interests”\n\n\n                                               - 43 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nfactor during the public meeting does not mean their ultimate vote to grant LEARN’s appeal was\n\nflawed. During the meeting, the commissioners discussed several aspects of LEARN’s proposal,\n\nand although the words “best interests” were never uttered, this undefined concept was clearly\n\nrelated to various discussions the commissioners had. Moreover, based on the Commission’s\n\nwritten decision, it is clear that the Commission analyzed this factor. Therefore, the\n\nCommission’s conclusion that LEARN’s proposal was in the best interests of the students the\n\nschool was designed to serve was not clearly erroneous.\n\n¶ 114 In sum, the Commission properly found that LEARN’s proposal was in compliance with\n\nthe requirements of the Charter Schools Law and in the best interests of the students the school\n\nwas designed to serve.\n\n¶ 115                                       D. Due Process\n\n¶ 116 District 60 next raises two due process challenges to the proceedings in front of the\n\nCommission. First, District 60 contends that the Commission improperly set conditions for\n\ngranting LEARN’s appeal, i.e., the performance agreement. Second, District 60 contends that the\n\nCommission’s approval of these conditions was made without providing the district an\n\nopportunity to review or address the adequacy of LEARN’s alleged compliance.\n\n¶ 117 The United States and Illinois Constitutions protect people against “governmental\n\ndeprivations of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” Village of Vernon Hills v.\n\nHeelan, 2015 IL 118170, ¶ 31 (citing U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 2).\n\nThere are two types of due process: substantive and procedural. In re Marriage of Miller, 227 Ill.\n\n2d 185, 197 (2007). “Whereas procedural due process governs the procedures employed to deny\n\na person’s life, liberty or property interest, substantive due process limits the state’s ability to act,\n\nirrespective of the procedural protections provided.” Id. In District 60’s brief, it does not state\n\n                                                 - 44 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nwhich type of due process claim it is bringing, but based on its arguments, it is clear that its due\n\nprocess claim is procedural in nature as the district assails the fairness of the procedures used by\n\nthe Commission. Whether a party’s procedural due process rights have been violated presents a\n\nlegal question we review de novo. Heelan, 2015 IL 118170, ¶ 31.\n\n¶ 118 Although due process concerns permeate in administrative proceedings (Abrahamson,\n\n153 Ill. 2d at 92), the Commission and ISBE argue that District 60 cannot assert a due process\n\nclaim against the state given that it is itself a state entity. District 60 does not respond to this\n\nargument, and we agree with the Commission and ISBE.\n\n¶ 119 District 60, as a school board, is a governmental agency, or rather a “ ‘municipal\n\ncorporation,’ created by the legislature and subject to its will.” East St. Louis Federation of\n\nTeachers, Local 1220 v. East St. Louis School District No. 189 Financial Oversight Panel, 178\n\nIll. 2d 399, 412-13 (1997). Because school boards are created by statute, they are offices entirely\n\nunder “the control of the legislature, ‘which may at pleasure create or abolish them,’ ” as well as\n\nmodify their duties. Id. at 413 (quoting Hughes v. Traeger, 264 Ill. 612, 616 (1914)). “The\n\nState’s control over units of local government is without regard to due process guarantees,” and\n\n“[t]he school board as an entity, therefore, cannot assert due process claims against the state.” Id.\n\nConsequently, District 60, as a school board, cannot assert due process claims against the\n\nCommission, an entity of the state. See id. Accordingly, both of District 60’s procedural due\n\nprocess claims fail.\n\n¶ 120                                 E. Open Meetings Act\n\n¶ 121 District 60 next contends that the Commission committed multiple violations of the Open\n\nMeetings Act (Act) (5 ILCS 120/1 et seq. (West 2014)) during its April 21, 2015, public meeting\n\nwhere it voted to grant LEARN’s appeal. Specifically, District 60 argues that (1) the chairman of\n\n                                               - 45 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthe Commission, Greg Richmond, incorrectly asserted that all nine commissioners were present\n\nwhen only seven members were physically present, (2) the Commission improperly allowed two\n\ncommissioners to vote telephonically without properly justifying their absence, (3) the\n\nCommission improperly utilized a roll call vote rather than a voice vote during the vote to allow\n\nthe two commissioners’ remote attendance, and (4) the Commission went into a closed session\n\nbased on a motion that failed to sufficiently identify the exception in the Act allowing for a\n\nclosed session. Based on these alleged violations, District 60 asserts that it was prejudiced and\n\nthe proper remedy, and only one requested, is to render the Commission’s decision to grant\n\nLEARN’s appeal “null and void.”\n\n¶ 122 The Act represents a public policy initiative by our legislature that public bodies of the\n\nstate, whose activities directly impact the lives of the citizens, should deliberate and take action\n\nin the open rather than in private. Id. § 1. To this end, the Act requires that “[a]ll meetings of\n\npublic bodies” must be open to the public unless a specific exception applies. Id. § 2(a). A\n\n“meeting” is defined as “any gathering, whether in person or by video or audio conference,\n\ntelephone call, *** of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held for the\n\npurpose of discussing public business.” Id. § 1.02. A “public body” means “all legislative,\n\nexecutive, administrative or advisory bodies of the State *** and all other municipal\n\ncorporations, boards, bureaus, committees or commissions of this State.” Id. The provisions of\n\nthe Act must be “strictly construed against closed meetings” (id. § 1(2)), and all final actions\n\nmade by a public body be must be done in an open meeting. Id. § 2(e).\n\n¶ 123 When a public body fails to comply with the provisions of the Act, “any person” may\n\nbring a civil action in the circuit court alleging noncompliance (id. § 3(a)), which is how District\n\n60 proceeded in this case. Although District 60, as a school board, could not assert due process\n\n\n                                               - 46 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nclaims against the Commission (see East St. Louis Federation, 178 Ill. 2d at 412-13), a “person,”\n\nas defined by the Act, has been interpreted broadly. In Paxson v. Board of Education of School\n\nDistrict No. 87, 276 Ill. App. 3d 912, 916, 918, 921 (1995), this court found that, consistent with\n\nthe Act’s purpose of requiring public bodies to act openly, the term a “person” should not be\n\nlimited to only individuals, but rather should incorporate “a body politic.” District 60, as a school\n\nboard, is a body politic (see 105 ILCS 5/10-2 (West 2014)), and thus can allege violations of the\n\nAct. If the circuit court determines that a violation has occurred, it:\n\n       “may grant such relief as it deems appropriate, including granting a relief by\n\n       mandamus requiring that a meeting be open to the public, granting an injunction\n\n       against future violations of this Act, ordering the public body to make available to\n\n       the public such portion of the minutes of a meeting as is not authorized to be kept\n\n       confidential under this Act, or declaring null and void any final action taken at a\n\n       closed meeting in violation of this Act.” 5 ILCS 120/3(c) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 124 Although the circuit court’s power to grant a remedy for violations of the Act is\n\ndiscretionary and ordinarily reviewed for an abuse of discretion (see Parker v. Nichting, 2012 IL\n\nApp (3d) 100206, ¶ 15), here, the circuit court did not dismiss District 60’s counts of alleged\n\nviolations of the Act on the merits. Because the court did not address the alleged violations of the\n\nAct on their merits and thus did not utilize its discretion to grant or deny a remedy available\n\nunder the Act, we will review the Commission’s alleged violations de novo.\n\n¶ 125 We first note that District 60 does not dispute that the Commission’s vote to grant\n\nLEARN’s appeal was a final action and that the vote occurred during an open session. And, of\n\nall the alleged violations of the Act, none of them concern a final action taken by the\n\nCommission in a closed session. The Act expressly states that the circuit court may only declare\n\n\n                                                - 47 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n“null and void any final action taken at a closed meeting in violation of this Act.” 5 ILCS\n\n120/3(c) (West 2014); see also Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees v. Martin, 309 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 924, 936 (1999) (finding that, because the selection of a principal occurred at an open\n\nmeeting, a party could not request nullification of that action because it was both “too extreme\n\nand not supported by the Open Meetings Act”); Williamson v. Doyle, 112 Ill. App. 3d 293, 300\n\n(1983) (finding that the provision in a prior version of the Act “permitting the court to declare\n\nthe action void refers by its terms only to a ‘closed session’ ”). Thus, assuming arguendo that the\n\nCommission committed the alleged violations of the Act, we find that, based on the language of\n\nthe Act, District 60’s requested relief—declaring the Commission’s decision to grant LEARN’s\n\nappeal null and void—is improper.\n\n¶ 126 Our conclusion is buttressed by the Act’s legislative history. Prior to 1981, what is now\n\nknown as the Act was called “AN ACT in relation to meetings.” 1957 Ill. Laws 2892 (adding Ill.\n\nRev. Stat. 1957, ch. 102, ¶ 41); Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 102, ¶ 41. In this previous version of the\n\nAct, the only civil remedy the circuit court could issue upon a violation or anticipated violation\n\nof the Act was “a writ of mandamus requiring that a meeting be open to the public at large or\n\nissue such other appropriate order as will insure compliance with the provisions of this Act.” Ill.\n\nRev. Stat. 1979, ch. 102, ¶ 43. However, Public Act 82-378 (eff. Jan. 1, 1982) (amending Ill.\n\nRev. Stat. 1979, ch. 102, ¶ 43) changed the civil remedies available for the circuit court to issue.\n\nAs a result of the public act, upon a violation or anticipated violation of the Act:\n\n       “The court, having due regard for orderly administration and the public interest,\n\n       as well as for the interests of the parties, may grant such equitable relief as it\n\n       deems appropriate, including issuance of a writ of mandamus requiring that a\n\n       meeting be open to the public, granting an injunction against future violations of\n\n\n                                                - 48 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n       this Act, ordering the public body to make available to the public such portion of\n\n       the minutes of a meeting as is not authorized to be kept confidential under this\n\n       Act, or declaring null and void any final action taken at a closed session in\n\n       violation of this Act.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 102, ¶ 43(c).\n\nThe 1981 version of the statute is substantially the same as the current version.\n\n¶ 127 During discussions of House Bill 411, which ultimately became Public Act 82-378 (eff.\n\nJan. 1, 1982), in the House of Representatives, Representative Reilly stated that the bill “clarifies\n\nthat action taken in closed session and only that action taken in closed session can be voided.”\n\n82nd Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 20, 1981, at 31 (statements of Representative\n\nReilly). Representative Reilly later stated that “[t]he intent is to invalidate only final action\n\nimproperly taken in secret” and “only the action that takes place in the closed meeting can be\n\nvoided not action that takes place in the open meeting.” Id. at 34, 59. It is clear that, based on the\n\nlegislative history of the Act, the circuit court’s power to declare a final action null and void is\n\nlimited to only those situations where a final action occurred during a closed meeting.\n\nAccordingly, even if District 60 could persuade us that the Commission committed multiple\n\nviolations of the Act, we would not grant the district its requested relief.\n\n¶ 128 Lastly, we note that District 60 could have followed the procedure set forth in section 3.5\n\nof the Act and initiated a request for review with the “Public Access Counselor” of the Office of\n\nthe Attorney General. 5 ILCS 120/3.5 (West 2014). Under this means of review, the Attorney\n\nGeneral reviews whether a violation of the Act has occurred and then issues a binding opinion on\n\nthe matter. Id. § 3.5(e); see also American Federation of State, County, & Municipal Employees,\n\nCouncil 31 v. Illinois Labor Relations Board, 2017 IL App (5th) 160046, ¶ 27 (“After review,\n\nthe Attorney General must issue a binding opinion.”). In that binding opinion, the Attorney\n\n\n                                                - 49 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nGeneral can direct the public body to take appropriate actions (5 ILCS 120/3.5(e) (West 2014);\n\nAmerican Federation, 2017 IL App (5th) 160046, ¶ 27), including voiding final actions taken in\n\nopen meetings. See, e.g., 2016 Ill. Att’y Gen. Pub. Access Op. No. 16-015 (after finding that the\n\nBoard of Trustees of the Village of Caseyville violated the Act by voting to amend and approve a\n\nsettlement agreement without providing proper public notice, the Attorney General voided the\n\noriginal vote and directed the board of trustees to reconsider the matter at a properly noticed\n\nmeeting); 2013 Ill. Att’y Gen. Pub. Access Op. No. 13-002 (after finding that the Chicago Park\n\nDistrict Board of Commissioners violated the Act by voting to increase fees for admission to two\n\nmuseums without providing proper public notice, the Attorney General voided the original vote\n\nand directed the board of commissioners to reconsider the matter at a properly noticed meeting).\n\n¶ 129 Had District 60 sought a remedy under section 3.5 of the Act (5 ILCS 120/3.5 (West\n\n2014)) with the Public Access Counselor originally rather than initiating an action in the circuit\n\ncourt under section 3 of the Act (id. § 3), the Attorney General may have voided the\n\nCommission’s vote on LEARN’s appeal upon a finding of noncompliance with the Act.\n\nHowever, District 60 instead sought a remedy in the circuit court that it had no power to grant\n\nbecause the formal vote on the matter occurred during a public meeting. As a result, we have no\n\nchoice but to reject its argument concerning the Commission’s alleged violations of the Act.\n\nAlthough the circuit court dismissed the counts of District 60’s complaint related to alleged\n\nviolations of the Act for different reasons, the counts were properly dismissed. See Vantage\n\nHospitality Group, Inc. v. Q Ill Development, LLC, 2016 IL App (4th) 160271, ¶ 54 (the\n\nappellate court may affirm the circuit court’s judgment on any basis supported by the record).\n\n¶ 130                          F. Dismissal of Remaining Counts\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 50 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 131 District 60 lastly contends that the other counts in its complaint should not have been\n\n\ndismissed. However, the district’s arguments center around the improper dismissal of its claims\n\n\nconcerning the Commission’s alleged violations of the Act. As we have already discussed this\n\n\nissue in our foregoing analysis, we need not discuss it any further. But to the extent District 60\n\n\nhas challenged the propriety of the circuit court’s dismissal of count IV of its complaint—the\n\n\ncount which sought a declaratory judgment against LEARN, the Commission and ISBE—we \n\n\nfind any such challenge forfeited for failing to cite any legal authority or develop a coherent legal\n\n\nargument. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017). \n\n\n¶ 132                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n\n¶ 133 Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County, \n\n\nwhich had affirmed the decision of the Commission and dismissed counts II, III, and IV of\n\n\nDistrict 60’s complaint. \n\n\n¶ 134 Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 51 ­\n\f",

After reviewing the submission, District 60 found several\n\ninadequacies with LEARN’s proposal and denied the application to open the school. LEARN\n\nappealed the denial to defendant, the Illinois State Charter School Commission (Commission),\n\nwho concluded that LEARN’s proposal was in compliance with the requirements of the Charter\n\nSchools Law (105 ILCS 5/27A-1 et seq. (West 2014)) and in the best interests of the students the\n\nschool was designed to serve. The Commission accordingly reversed the decision of District 60\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nand agreed to a charter with LEARN, which was certified by defendant, the Illinois State Board\n\nof Education (ISBE), thus establishing the charter school. District 60 subsequently filed a\n\ncomplaint in the circuit court for administrative review and alleged that the Commission\n\ncommitted multiple violations of the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/1 et seq. (West 2014)).\n\nThe circuit court affirmed the Commission’s decision and dismissed the remaining counts of\n\nDistrict 60’s complaint. Meanwhile, in the fall of 2015 and during the pendency of the circuit\n\ncourt proceedings, LEARN began operating its charter school in Waukegan with approximately\n\n200 students from kindergarten to third grade.\n\n¶2     Before this court, District 60 contends that (1) the Commission and ISBE lost jurisdiction\n\nover LEARN’s appeal and certification when they failed to adhere to the statutory timeline of the\n\nCharter Schools Law, (2) the Commission improperly reversed the district’s decision to deny\n\nLEARN’s proposal where the application was deficient in several manners and not in the best\n\ninterests of the students the school was designed to serve, (3) the Commission violated the\n\ndistrict’s due process rights, (4) the Commission committed multiple violations of the Open\n\nMeetings Act, and (5) the circuit court erred in dismissing the remaining counts of its complaint.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n¶3                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4                                A. The Charter Schools Law\n\n¶5     A charter school is a tuition-free public school supported by public funds but operated by\n\na nonprofit entity independent from the school district in which it operates. 105 ILCS 5/27A­\n\n5(a), (e) (West 2014); Comprehensive Community Solutions, Inc. v. Rockford School District No.\n\n205, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094764\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094764/comprehensive-community-solutions-v-rockford-school-district-no-205/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 458 (2005). In 1996, the Illinois legislature enacted the Charter Schools\n\nLaw as a means to provide alternative public education models that were innovative and flexible\n\n                                                 -2­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nbut still maintained high levels of student performance with a particular focus on students who\n\nwere less likely to succeed in a traditional educational environment because of “physical,\n\nemotional, socioeconomic, or cultural factors.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-2(a), (b), 27A-3 (West 2014).\n\nTo promote innovation and flexibility, the Charter Schools Law exempts charter schools from\n\nseveral state laws and regulations that are applicable to traditional schools. Id. § 27A-5(g). A\n\ncharter school operates under a charter, or contract, between the nonprofit entity and the school’s\n\nauthorizer, which may be the local school board or the Commission, depending on who\n\nultimately approves the charter. Id. §§ 27A-6(a), 27A-9(f).\n\n¶6      Charter schools are open for enrollment “to any pupil who resides within the geographic\n\nboundaries of the area served by the local school board.” Id. § 27A-4(d). If there are more\n\napplicants to the school than spaces available, enrollees must be selected by a lottery. Id. § 27A­\n\n4(h). Because charter schools are supported by public funds and enroll students who otherwise\n\nwould attend traditional public schools, they take funding away from the local school district. Id.\n\n§§ 27A-9(f), 27A-11(b). Part of the charter school’s funding is based on a percentage of the local\n\nschool district’s per capita tuition charge, at the time of LEARN’s proposal between 75% and\n\n125%, multiplied by the amount of students enrolled in the charter school that reside in the local\n\nschool district. 1 Id. § 27A-11(b).\n\n¶7      An entity that wants to open a charter school must submit a proposal to the school board\n\nin the district where the charter school would be located. Id. § 27A-7(a). In order to demonstrate\n\nthat the proposed charter school would be a suitable educational alternative, the proposal must\n\n        1\n          The per capita tuition charge is essentially a calculation used to quantify the amount of money a\nschool district pays from its own resources for each student enrolled in its schools. Recently, our\nlegislature changed the permissible funding range of charter schools to between 97% and 103% of the\nlocal school district’s per capita tuition charge. Pub. Act 100-465 (eff. Aug. 31, 2017) (amending 105\nILCS 5/27A-11(b)).\n\n                                                   -3­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\ncontain several requirements, including identifying two potential locations for the school;\n\ndescribing the school’s educational program, goals, objectives and performance standards; and\n\nproviding evidence that the terms of the proposed charter are “economically sound” for both the\n\nschool and the district. Id. §§ 27A-7(a)(3), (5), (7), (9).\n\n¶8      Following the submission of the proposal, the local school board must vote to either grant\n\nor deny the charter school’s application. Id. § 27A-8(e). If the board denies the application, the\n\napplicant may appeal the denial to the Commission, who subsequently conducts a de novo\n\nreview of the proposal. Id. § 27A-8(g); 23 Ill. Adm. Code 650.110(d)(1) (2012). The\n\nCommission may reverse the denial if it “finds that the proposal (i) is in compliance with [the\n\nCharter Schools Law] and (ii) is in the best interests of the students the charter school is designed\n\nto serve.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h) (West 2014).\n\n¶9      If the Commission reverses the local school board’s denial, the Commission itself\n\nbecomes the charter school’s authorizer, meaning it oversees the charter school rather the school\n\nboard. Id. §§ 27A-3, 27A-9(f). Under these circumstances, the charter school also becomes its\n\nown local educational agency (id. § 27A-5(k)), which under federal law has a specific meaning.\n\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 7801(26)(A) (2012). As its own local educational agency, the charter school\n\nbecomes entirely responsible for implementing services required by law that ordinarily would be\n\nthe responsibility of the local school district, such as implementing procedures to comply with\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. (2012)); see 105 ILCS\n\n5/14-1.01 et seq. (West 2014). Regardless of who authorizes the charter school, ISBE must\n\ncertify the application and charter before the school begins to operate. 105 ILCS 5/27A-6(d),\n\n27A-9(f) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 10                            B. Waukegan Community Unit School District 60\n\n\n                                                  -4­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 11   During the 2013-2014 school year, District 60 served approximately 16,300 students.\n\nAmong its students, 77% were Hispanic, 16% were black and 4% were white. Additionally, 72%\n\nof District 60’s students were low-income; 29% were English language learners (ELL), generally\n\nstudents whose native language is not English; and 12% had disabilities. In the Illinois Standards\n\nAchievement Test (ISAT), 39% of District 60’s students met or exceeded the state standards\n\ncompared to the statewide average of 59%. District 60’s graduation rate was 76% compared to\n\nthe statewide average of 86%, and 18% of its students were “college ready” compared to the\n\nstatewide average of 46%.\n\n¶ 12                                 C. LEARN’s Proposal\n\n¶ 13   In 2014, LEARN, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity whose first charter school opened in 2001,\n\noperated eight charter schools in the Chicago area, including one in North Chicago, and served\n\napproximately 3600 elementary and middle school students. LEARN’s mission was to provide\n\nminority and low-income students “with the academic foundation and ambition to earn a college\n\ndegree,” and to that end, it focused on elementary education where it believed “the ambition and\n\nacademic foundation for college must be sown and cultivated.” Among LEARN’s students, 89%\n\nwere black, 9% were Hispanic, and 89% were low-income. LEARN touted that 95% of its\n\nstudents graduated from high school and attended college.\n\n¶ 14    During the spring of 2014, LEARN conducted a needs assessment of various\n\ncommunities in the Chicago area and identified District 60 as one that could benefit from a\n\nLEARN charter school. On November 14, 2014, based on this perceived need, LEARN\n\nsubmitted a proposal to District 60 to open a charter school in Waukegan that would open in\n\nSeptember 2015. LEARN envisioned that the Waukegan campus would initially enroll 200\n\nstudents in kindergarten through third grade and add one grade per year until the school had 600\n\n\n                                              -5­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nstudents enrolled in 2021 and was a fully functioning kindergarten through eighth grade (K-8)\n\nschool.\n\n¶ 15      In its proposal, LEARN supplied various data that compared the academic performance\n\nof its students to District 60’s students. In particular, in 2013 ISAT testing, 54% of LEARN’s\n\nChicago students met or exceeded the state standards. However, among students who had\n\nattended a LEARN school for five or more years, 66% met or exceeded the state standards\n\nwhereas, among students who had attended a LEARN school for only one year, 39% met or\n\nexceeded the state standards. Additionally, in 2013 ISAT testing, LEARN’s students\n\noutperformed District 60’s students overall in reading and mathematics, as well as in those\n\nsubjects for the Hispanic, low-income, limited English proficiency, and black subgroups. The\n\ndata also showed that LEARN’s students overall fell below the statewide average in reading and\n\nmathematics, but exceeded the statewide average in those subjects for the Hispanic, low-income,\n\nlimited English proficiency, and black subgroups.\n\n¶ 16      The proposal stated that LEARN would utilize the Common Core standards and focus on\n\nfour core subjects: English language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. LEARN\n\nprovided a detailed description of its proposed curriculum on these subjects and noted that its\n\neducational plan also placed a “special emphasis” on STEM (science, technology, engineering\n\nand mathematics) learning. LEARN also would ensure that its students received weekly\n\n“enrichment” classes in visual and performance arts, technology, physical education, and\n\nSpanish.\n\n¶ 17      LEARN’s proposal described how it would meet the needs of ELL students and students\n\nwith disabilities. Concerning ELL students, the proposal indicated that LEARN would identify\n\nthem through a survey, use different educational models depending on how many students had\n\n\n                                              -6­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nbeen identified, and monitor their progress with various assessments. Concerning students with\n\ndisabilities, LEARN noted how students would be identified and believed that such students\n\nwere “better served” with “an inclusion program rather than a pullout program.” LEARN\n\naccordingly would first attempt to provide accommodations in the general classroom. LEARN\n\nalso stated that it employed occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, social\n\nworkers, counselors, and psychologists.\n\n¶ 18   The proposal discussed LEARN’s utilization of data-based instruction, its academic\n\nperformance goals, its school culture and climate, and what the school calendar and daily\n\nschedule would look like. The proposal provided various school policies, including a student\n\ncode of conduct, school safety protocols, and how teachers would be evaluated. Additionally, the\n\nproposal talked about LEARN’s student recruitment strategy, the school’s proposed operational\n\nstructure, and many other details necessary to the functioning of a school.\n\n¶ 19   LEARN identified two different locations for the school. The first site, an 18,000-square\n\nfoot stand-alone facility, was located at 2634 Grand Avenue in Waukegan, and had previously\n\nbeen used as a medical office building. As constructed, the building could support a kindergarten\n\nthrough fifth grade school, but with an addition could support a K-8 school. The facility was\n\navailable for lease or purchase but would require a zoning variance. Capital improvements were\n\nalso necessary, and the building had one current tenant. The second site, a 91,000 square foot\n\nfacility connected to a retail mall, was located at 2700 North Belvidere Road in Waukegan. The\n\nbuilding was available only to lease but large enough to accommodate a K-8 school. The\n\nbuilding required rezoning and capital improvements. LEARN provided an estimated five- to\n\nsix-month timeline to make either location operational and noted its past experience in\n\ntransforming other facilities into schools.\n\n\n                                               -7­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 20   Additionally, LEARN’s proposal discussed the finances of LEARN itself and included an\n\naudited financial statement as well as provided a budget and budget narrative for the proposed\n\nschool. According to LEARN’s most recent audit, as of June 30, 2012, it had approximately\n\n$16.6 million in assets and $8.7 million in liabilities. In each year from 2012 to 2014, LEARN\n\nhad raised over $3 million. The budget for the proposed school assumed certain enrollment\n\nnumbers and forecasted the school’s financial position for six years, projecting its income,\n\nexpenses, and potential capital expenditures. Concerning income, LEARN sought a per capita\n\ntuition charge of $10,132 but also intended to obtain additional funding from loans, grants, and\n\nother contributions from foundations and individuals. Concerning expenses, LEARN stated that,\n\nbased on its experience, it would need “a contingency expense” equal to 10% of its total\n\nexpenses to withstand any unexpected costs.\n\n¶ 21   Lastly, the proposal contained the proposed charter agreement between LEARN and\n\nDistrict 60, insurance information, and several appendices of documents, including detailed\n\nprogram frameworks for different subjects, sample sequence reports, and a sample Common\n\nCore standards teaching training agenda.\n\n¶ 22                                D. District 60’s Decision\n\n¶ 23   On January 6, 2015, District 60 denied LEARN’s proposal, finding several inadequacies,\n\nincluding (1) the lack of community support, (2) “serious flaws and gaps” with the proposed\n\neducational program concerning, in particular, services to special education students and ELL\n\nstudents, (3) the lack of “significant achievement” of LEARN North Chicago, which was located\n\nin a community with comparable demographics to Waukegan, and (4) “lingering questions about\n\nclimate and culture in LEARN schools.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 24   Additionally, District 60 determined that the proposed school would not be economically\n\nsound and identified multiple issues with the financial aspect of the proposal. These included that\n\nLEARN’s “year end fund balance was negative indicating a deficit” as of June 30, 2012, and its\n\n“current ratio,” a measure of liquidity determined by dividing assets by liabilities, was 1.91, thus\n\nbelow “the commonly accepted threshold of 2.0.” District 60 also observed that LEARN had not\n\nprovided audited financial reports from the 2013 fiscal year, suggesting to the district that\n\nLEARN’s financial position had worsened. District 60 also pinpointed several issues with the\n\nschool’s proposed budget, including that LEARN failed to provide evidence of specific funding\n\nsources, did not take into consideration transportation costs for its students, neglected to provide\n\nsufficient information on a food service program, and failed to adequately consider the financial\n\nimpact of serving students with special needs.\n\n¶ 25   Moreover, District 60 found that the proposed school would “cause grievous financial\n\nharm” to the district by shifting “scarce” resources away from it. District 60 determined that it\n\nwould lose nearly $23 million over six years if the school operated as intended, which would\n\n“significantly impair[ ]” the district’s ability to meet its fixed overhead and operational costs.\n\nDistrict 60 further asserted that it would have to make significant reductions in services, forgo\n\ncurrent educational initiatives, and add to its $49.6 million of long-term debt.\n\n¶ 26                           E. LEARN’s Appeal to the Commission\n\n¶ 27   On February 5, 2015, LEARN appealed District 60’s decision to the Commission. In its\n\nappeal, LEARN included a memorandum that reiterated the information contained in its\n\nproposal, responded to the alleged inadequacies raised by District 60, and included information\n\nnot contained in its proposal to provide added support and update its proposal “based on\n\nprogress” that had occurred after the original submission. District 60 did not object to LEARN’s\n\n\n                                                 -9­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nrequest, and the Commission accepted the new information. The additional information included\n\ntwo new proposed locations for the charter school, further financial information, supplementary\n\ncurriculum information, elaboration on its strategy for serving ELL students, and plans for\n\nbecoming its own local educational agency.\n\n¶ 28   The first new site was a 32,000-square foot two-story facility located at 800 South\n\nGenesee Street in Waukegan. The building was built in 2005, in excellent condition and already\n\nhad more than 30 classrooms, a full gym, a cafeteria, offices and other space necessary for a\n\nschool. The building only needed a minimal investment in order to become operational as a\n\nschool and also could accommodate the school’s anticipated growth. LEARN also noted that the\n\nbuilding’s owner had expressed a desire to lease the facility to it. Given these details, LEARN\n\ndeemed the site “the most viable option.” The second new site was a 37,000-square foot two-\n\nstory facility located at 202 North Genesee Street in Waukegan. The facility was relatively new\n\nand had an open, unfinished design inside that could be refurbished to function as a school more\n\nquickly than the original two sites. It was also large enough to accommodate the anticipated\n\ngrowth of the school. LEARN stated that construction could be performed in phases and\n\nsegregated from school activities.\n\n¶ 29   LEARN also responded to District 60’s assertions concerning its financial health, the\n\nprojected budget for the school, and the financial impact on the district. LEARN disputed\n\nDistrict 60’s computation of its year-end fund balance, insisting it was not negative, but rather a\n\npositive $7.9 million for the 2012 fiscal year. LEARN provided an update on its current assets\n\nand liabilities, which resulted in a current ratio of 2.16 as of January 2015, as well as audited\n\nfinancial statements from 2013 and 2014. According to LEARN, it meant to, but did not, submit\n\nthe 2013 audit as part of its proposal while the 2014 audit had not yet been completed at the time\n\n\n                                              - 10 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nof the submission. Regarding the school’s projected budget, LEARN stated that it had recently\n\nauthorized funding of up to $1 million in start-up costs for the campus and secured commitments\n\nfor donations from five donors, which were listed, for approximately $8 million over five years.\n\nLEARN further updated its original budget to include a food service plan and disputed District\n\n60’s concerns over the sufficiency of its funding plan for special education students.\n\n¶ 30   Concerning the financial impact on District 60, LEARN asserted that, as of the 2013\n\nfiscal year, the district had a fund balance of $37 million, which was higher than the 2011 or\n\n2012 fiscal years. Additionally, LEARN highlighted that District 60 had approximately $36\n\nmillion of cash on hand, or 75 days’ worth, an amount which had been increasing over the past\n\nyears. LEARN further highlighted that, between 2011 and 2013, District 60 had operated at a\n\nsurplus every year with its revenues growing every year. LEARN’s data also showed that\n\nDistrict 60’s surplus had decreased each year since 2011 and was approximately $2 million as of\n\n2013. Based on District 60’s alleged “robust” financial position, LEARN concluded that, even\n\nwhen considering its request for funding at a 100% per capita tuition charge, its Waukegan\n\ncampus would represent 1% to 2% of District 60’s budget and the district would maintain its\n\n“strong financial” position and remain “financially solvent” with the school’s presence.\n\n¶ 31   Additionally, LEARN acknowledged that, if it was successful on appeal, its school would\n\nnot be part of District 60 but rather its own local educational agency. Consequently, LEARN\n\nstated that it had conversations with charter schools that were operating as local educational\n\nagencies, reviewed revenue data from charter schools authorized by the Commission, and\n\nobtained further guidance from its legal counsel. LEARN asserted that it was prepared to\n\ndedicate the resources necessary to be fully responsible for the instruction of special education\n\nand ELL students and the transportation of its students. LEARN provided corresponding plans\n\n\n                                               - 11 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\non these matters and submitted a revised budget to include the added expenses, including line\n\nitems on transportation, food service and special education services.\n\n¶ 32    District 60 responded to LEARN’s memorandum, arguing that, even when considering\n\nthe new information on appeal, the proposal still did not satisfy the criteria enumerated in the\n\nCharter Schools Law, specifically as it related to serving special education, ELL, and at-risk\n\nstudents; the fiscal capability of LEARN to operate the school; and the financial impact on the\n\ndistrict. District 60 also highlighted that, while the proposed location at 800 South Genesee\n\nStreet had been “described positively,” there was no evidence that an architect had reviewed the\n\nfacility and determined whether a school could operate there. Furthermore, District 60 posited\n\nthat LEARN did not sufficiently address whether the location could meet the transportation or\n\nfood service needs of the school. District 60 also included a report prepared by Dr. Benjamin\n\nDitkowsky, which was based on data from the Illinois Report Card. 2 Dr. Ditkowsky’s report\n\nacknowledged that the academic performance of LEARN’s students “appear[ed] impressive” but\n\ncould be explained by variables unique to its schools. In particular, the report noted a high rate of\n\nattrition of LEARN’s students as they matriculated through school grades, suggesting that the\n\nstudents who left the schools were academically inferior to those who remained. Additionally,\n\nthe report found that the level of chronic truancy, i.e., missing 10 days or more of school the\n\nprior year, at LEARN’s schools was more than twice the rate of District 60’s schools and more\n\nthan three to four times the statewide average, suggesting that this level of truancy led to lower\n\ntest participation and higher test scores, as those who took the test were academically superior to\n\nthose who did not.\n        2\n          The Illinois Report Card is a compilation of data published annually by ISBE showing how\nindividual schools, school districts and the state as a whole are performing on a variety of academic\nperformance measures, as well as providing the demographic composition of the schools, districts, and\nthe state. 105 ILCS 5/10-17a (West 2014).\n\n                                                 - 12 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 33   LEARN responded to the critiques of its academic success, asserting that the “mobility\n\nrate,” a statistic measuring the percentage of students who transfer in and out of a school, for its\n\nChicago schools was lower than District 60’s schools for each of the past five years and lower\n\nthan the statewide average for four of the last five years. LEARN acknowledged that its North\n\nChicago school had a high mobility rate, but explained that the school, and the North Chicago\n\nCommunity Unit School District 187 as a whole, had a high percentage of military families who\n\nrelocated often as part of their careers. Furthermore, LEARN acknowledged that the Illinois\n\nReport Card showed that over one-third of its Chicago students were chronically truant but noted\n\nthat its “[a]ttendance data,” also from the Illinois Report Card, showed that its Chicago students\n\nattended school at a higher rate than students in District 60 and the statewide average. LEARN\n\nstated that the “discrepancy” between its chronic truancy and attendance data was “severe” and\n\nwould be “investigate[d].”\n\n¶ 34   On March 12, 2015, the Commission, as part of its due diligence process, held interviews\n\nwith several representatives of LEARN and several representatives of District 60.\n\n¶ 35   Four days later, Dr. Michael Anderson, an education consultant with the Lake County\n\nRegional Office of Education, issued a report on whether the facility located at 800 South\n\nGenesee Street could pass various safety and health codes. Dr. Anderson observed that the\n\nfacility was “clean,” was well-maintained, and had “many facilities that one would find in a\n\nregular public school,” such as a large gymnasium, offices, a cafeteria, a kitchen, and several\n\nclassrooms. Although Dr. Anderson determined that the building met the safety and health codes\n\nin several respects, he also found that “a few stairways” did not, some floor tiles “probably\n\ncontain[ed] asbestos,” and certain windows would need to be modified to “allow for quick and\n\neasy escape.” Dr. Anderson also noted issues with the parking lot and the size of the classrooms.\n\n\n                                               - 13 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 36   On March 30, 2015, an employee of LEARN e-mailed the Commission, stating that it\n\nwas no longer considering the facility at 2634 Grand Avenue due to necessary renovations being\n\ntoo costly. The employee stated that the other three locations were still viable options for the\n\nschool but highlighted 800 South Genesee Street as the preferred site and noted an architectural\n\nreview of the facility revealed that the location would be able to open in the fall of 2015 despite\n\n“some items” needing “attention.”\n\n¶ 37   The next day, the Commission held a public hearing. According to a summary of the\n\nhearing, 105 people signed in to support LEARN while 80 signed in to support District 60.\n\nAmong the people who spoke at the hearing, 28 supported LEARN while 29 supported District\n\n60. During the week following the hearing, the Commission received 40 e-mails in support of\n\nLEARN and 32 e-mails in support of District 60.\n\n¶ 38   On April 9, 2015, IFF Real Estate Services, LLC (IFF) submitted a “desk review” in\n\nresponse to the Commission’s request to assess the feasibility of having a charter school located\n\nat 800 South Genesee Street and 2700 North Belvidere Road. In order to render the assessment,\n\nIFF reviewed various documentation, including an analysis performed by an architecture firm on\n\neach of the properties, LEARN’s memorandum on appeal, and a proposed term sheet for 800\n\nSouth Genesee Street. Concerning 800 South Genesee Street, although IFF generally concluded\n\nthat the building could be converted to accommodate a charter school, it required clarification on\n\nthe square footage of the building, noting a discrepancy between LEARN’s memorandum on\n\nappeal and the proposed term sheet. IFF determined that, if the square footage of the term sheet\n\nwas correct, LEARN would eventually outgrow the facility, but the facility would be a “good\n\noption” if LEARN reduced its proposed student population or increased the size of the facility.\n\nConcerning 2700 North Belvidere Road, IFF concluded that the facility could be converted to\n\n\n                                              - 14 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\naccommodate the charter school but that it would likely require more funding than the $750,000\n\nLEARN had initially allocated.\n\n¶ 39   On April 15, 2015, the Commission’s staff issued a report, recommending that the\n\nCommission grant LEARN’s appeal with a funding level of 91% of District 60’s per capita\n\ntuition charge. The report noted that the academic performance in LEARN’s schools was “very\n\nstrong” and highlighted that, in 2013 ISAT testing for low-income students in mathematics and\n\nreading, LEARN’s schools outperformed all of District 60’s schools except for one “admissions­\n\nbased magnet school.” Additionally, in 2014 ISAT testing, LEARN’s schools outperformed\n\nDistrict 60’s schools “in all tested subjects overall, and for low-income/at-risk students.” With\n\nregard to ELL students, although LEARN had a small population of them at its schools, those\n\nattending LEARN North Chicago, a location demographically similar to Waukegan, significantly\n\noutperformed both District 60 and the statewide average in reading and mathematics scores in\n\n2014 ISAT testing. The report also indicated that “independent analyses by outside experts\n\nconfirm LEARN’s academic data and do not support [District 60’s] challenges,” specifically\n\nciting Dr. Ditkowsky’s analysis.\n\n¶ 40   Concerning LEARN’s finances, the report concluded that it had “a 14-year track record\n\nof running a financially sound network of charter schools.” The report found that District 60’s\n\nexpenses and revenues had risen during the past three years, and although its net income had\n\nbeen declining each year, its cash on hand had increased. The report noted that District 60’s\n\nenrollment had been “accelerating,” which would “significantly offset” the loss of students to the\n\ncharter school. The report concluded that, contrary to District 60’s claim, the district was not\n\n“likely to suffer economic hardship” if the Commission granted LEARN’s appeal with funding\n\nat 91% of the district’s per capita tuition charge, the staff’s recommended award, or even 100%.\n\n\n                                              - 15 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 41   Concerning LEARN’s facility plan, the report highlighted that LEARN had built or\n\nremodeled four campuses in the past decade. The report found that LEARN had “experience\n\nnegotiating contracts, obtaining zoning and permits and incentivizing contractors to timely”\n\ncomplete their projects. The report observed that LEARN had identified a total of four locations\n\nfor the school, two in its proposal to District 60 and two on appeal to the Commission, but as of\n\nApril 2015, LEARN had focused on 800 South Genesee Street and 2700 North Belvidere Road.\n\nHowever, the report noted that, given the material available on appeal, independent financial and\n\nconstruction evaluators could not determine whether LEARN would be able to open the\n\nWaukegan campus on time. The report further observed that LEARN did not have much\n\nexperience with ELL or Hispanic students and had never operated a school as a local educational\n\nagency. However, the report concluded that, due to LEARN’s experience and “track record” of\n\nsuccess at its other eight schools, it should have the opportunity to replicate its success in\n\nWaukegan. Although the staff recommended granting LEARN’s appeal, it suggested that,\n\nbecause of the “limited time for opening in September, 2015,” the grant should be contingent on\n\nLEARN satisfying a performance agreement that required it to “finalize its facility plan, pre­\n\nopening budget, and timeline” by May 15, 2015.\n\n¶ 42   Leading up to the Commission’s scheduled public meeting, in which it would vote on\n\nLEARN’s appeal, set to begin in the afternoon of April 21, 2015, its staff met with\n\nrepresentatives from LEARN and District 60. The staff informed the parties that its\n\nrecommendation was to grant LEARN’s appeal subject to the performance agreement.\n\n¶ 43   On the morning of April 21, 2015, the Commission e-mailed the parties with several\n\nattachments, including one where the Commission requested District 60 to provide “any\n\nevidence and/or verification” on its assertions that it would suffer grievous financial harm if the\n\n\n                                              - 16 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nappeal was granted. That document also informed the parties that two of the Commissioners\n\nwould participate in the meeting by telephone. Another attachment, which was a recommended\n\nmotion to grant LEARN’s appeal, stated that LEARN would be allowed to satisfy the conditions\n\nof the performance agreement by July 1, 2015, rather than May 15, 2015.\n\n¶ 44   Shortly after receiving this e-mail, District 60’s general counsel, Thomas Morris, replied,\n\nobjecting to the Commission’s request for additional evidence of financial harm because of the\n\nshort notice. Morris asserted that additional evidence existed but was impossible to gather by the\n\ntime of the meeting. Morris also complained that it was unfair LEARN would have additional\n\ntime to satisfy the conditions of the performance agreement while District 60 had been required\n\nto meet its deadlines. Morris argued that extending the deadlines to only one party showed that\n\nthe Commission was biased and acting “arbitrar[ily] and capricious[ly].”\n\n¶ 45                          F. The Commission’s Public Meeting\n\n¶ 46   On April 21, 2015, at 3:05 p.m., Greg Richmond, the chairman of the Commission, took\n\nroll call. Seven of the commissioners were physically present while two others appeared\n\ntelephonically, with their telephonic presence being approved unanimously by motion. After\n\ntending to a separate matter on the agenda, the Commission heard public comments on\n\nLEARN’s appeal. Thereafter, the Commission discussed reports from Richmond, its various\n\ncommittees, its legal counsel, and its interim executive director. Commissioner Bill Farmer then\n\nmade a motion for the Commission to hold a closed session “for the expressed purpose of\n\nconsidering the following subject, consideration of evidence by the Commission or a committee\n\nof the Commission as a quasi-[adjudicative] body.” The motion passed unanimously, and the\n\nCommission adjourned into a closed session.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 17 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 47   When the Commission returned to an open session, it began consideration of LEARN’s\n\nappeal. Hosanna Mahaley-Jones, the interim executive director of the Commission, gave a\n\npresentation summarizing the staff’s recommendation to grant LEARN’s appeal and its two key\n\nreasons: (1) “performance” and (2) “capacity.” First, she highlighted that, in ISAT testing,\n\nLEARN’s schools generally outperformed District 60’s schools overall and for low-income\n\nstudents, at-risk students, ELL students, students with disabilities, black students, and Hispanic\n\nstudents. Second, Mahaley-Jones observed that LEARN had a lengthy track record “of running\n\nfinancially sound schools,” and although LEARN would be operating as a local educational\n\nagency for the first time, it had “the capacity” to do so. She also addressed District 60’s concerns\n\nabout the proposed school and deemed them unwarranted.\n\n¶ 48   Following Mahaley-Jones’s presentation, LEARN gave a presentation and requested that\n\nit be funded at 100% of District 60’s per capita tuition charge, arguing that anything less would\n\nresult in drastic consequences for the proposed school. District 60 also gave a presentation, in\n\nwhich its outside counsel responded to many of the statements made by Mahaley-Jones and\n\nLEARN in their presentations. District 60’s counsel further informed the Commission that it\n\ncould not “sufficiently respond” to the request for additional evidence of financial harm due to\n\nits receipt of the request on such short notice. Counsel concluded that LEARN’s proposal was\n\nnot in the best interests of the students the school was designed to serve for various reasons,\n\nincluding that LEARN lacked a viable facility to house the school and was not prepared to\n\nundertake the responsibilities required of a local educational agency.\n\n¶ 49   The commissioners subsequently asked questions of LEARN and District 60’s\n\nrepresentatives and held their own discussions of various issues, including the impact of funding\n\nthe school at 91% versus 100% of the district’s per capita tuition charge and about LEARN’s\n\n\n                                               - 18 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\npreferred location of 800 South Genesee Street. Eventually, the commissioners voted 5-4 to grant\n\nLEARN’s appeal to establish the Waukegan charter school at a funding level of 100% of District\n\n60’s per capita tuition charge provided that, by July 1, 2015, LEARN had to (1) execute a facility\n\nlease, (2) obtain approval from the Commission’s staff on a facility plan that would allow the\n\nWaukegan campus to open by September 15, 2015, and (3) obtain approval from the\n\nCommission’s staff on a revised budget plan with a 100% funding level.\n\n¶ 50    On April 29, 2015, the Commission sent a report summarizing its vote to ISBE.\n\n¶ 51                            G. The Commission’s Written Decision\n\n¶ 52    The next day, the Commission sent LEARN and District 60 its final written decision. In\n\nthe decision, the Commission discussed several aspects of LEARN’s proposal. Concerning the\n\nfacility plan, the Commission noted that LEARN initially proposed locating its Waukegan\n\ncampus at either 2634 Grand Avenue or 2700 North Belvidere Road, but observed that LEARN\n\nlater amended the proposal to include facilities located at 800 South Genesee Street and 202\n\nNorth Genesee Street. The Commission found that LEARN identified “three viable facilities,” all\n\nbut the 2634 Grand Avenue facility, and noted that the Charter Schools Law only required an\n\napplicant to identify two facilities.\n\n¶ 53    Concerning LEARN’s finances, the Commission observed that LEARN’s assets were\n\n$14.8 million while its liabilities were $6.8 million and that LEARN projected a positive net\n\nincome for the first five years of the Waukegan campus. The Commission noted that LEARN’s\n\nWaukegan budget contained a 3% contingency and found that LEARN had appropriate internal\n\nfinancial controls and reporting mechanisms. Furthermore, the Commission highlighted that\n\nLEARN had raised over $3 million each year since 2012 and had secured enough funding to\n\nsupport the school’s start-up costs. The Commission further highlighted that it had a precedent of\n\n                                              - 19 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nfunding Commission-authorized charter schools at 100% of the local school district’s per capita\n\ntuition charge and determined that amount to be the appropriate level of funding for the\n\nWaukegan school. The Commission asserted that a 100% funding level “did not materially\n\nharm” District 60 or impact its financial solvency, as LEARN’s impact on the district’s total\n\nbudget would range from less than 1% in 2016 to slightly more than 2% in 2020. Based on the\n\nevidence before it, the Commission concluded that LEARN’s proposed Waukegan campus\n\ncomplied with the Charter Schools Law.\n\n¶ 54   The Commission next analyzed if the proposal was in the best interests of the students the\n\nschool was designed to serve, observing that its analysis focused on the sufficiency of LEARN’s\n\neducational plan, organizational plan, and business plan and its capacity to execute. The\n\nCommission highlighted the superior academic performance of LEARN’s students compared to\n\nDistrict 60’s students, but acknowledged that LEARN’s experience with ELL students was\n\n“limited.” Nevertheless, the Commission noted that LEARN’s ELL students “greatly\n\noutperformed” the students in District 60 and statewide in reading and mathematics test scores.\n\nMoreover, the Commission asserted that LEARN’s organizational plan, business plan and\n\ncapacity to execute “met or exceeded the standards required.” All told, the Commission\n\ndetermined that the proposal was in the best interests of the students the school was designed to\n\nserve. Accordingly, the Commission granted LEARN’s appeal and reversed District 60’s denial\n\nsubject to LEARN satisfying the conditions of the performance agreement.\n\n¶ 55                             H. Post-Decision Proceedings\n\n¶ 56   Approximately two months later, LEARN submitted the documentation required by the\n\nperformance agreement, including a lease for a building located at 540 South McAlister Avenue\n\nin Waukegan, a facility plan with a renovation schedule, and a revised budget. On July 1, 2015,\n\n\n                                             - 20 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthe Commission’s staff issued a compliance report, finding that LEARN had complied with all of\n\nthe requirements of the performance agreement. Consequently, on that same day, LEARN and\n\nthe Commission executed a charter agreement for a term of five years. The Commission\n\nsubsequently informed ISBE of the agreement. Over the next two months, LEARN worked with\n\nISBE to clarify and correct some issues with the charter agreement. Ultimately, on August 27,\n\n2015, ISBE certified the charter.\n\n¶ 57                                I. Circuit Court Proceedings\n\n¶ 58   On June 4, 2015, District 60 filed a complaint in the circuit court against the\n\nCommission, ISBE, and LEARN, alleging four counts. Count I sought administrative review\n\nagainst all three defendants and alleged that the Commission’s decision to grant LEARN’s\n\nappeal was clearly erroneous because LEARN failed to (1) provide two viable facilities for the\n\ncharter school, (2) propose an adequate educational plan for the school, in particular for ELL\n\nstudents and students with disabilities, (3) submit a complete description of the governance and\n\noperations of the school, (4) demonstrate how it would meet the needs of Waukegan’s high\n\npopulation of at-risk students, and (5) provide sufficient evidence to show that the terms of the\n\ncharter were economically sound for both the school and District 60. In addition, District 60\n\nclaimed that the Commission’s decision was “late and unlawful” because it e-mailed ISBE the\n\nvote summary “after 5:00 p.m. on April 30th,” or “after the close of business on the seventh day\n\nafter the Commission’s meeting approving the charter school.” Further, District 60 alleged that\n\nthe Commission set conditions under which it would approve LEARN’s appeal “without the\n\nlegal authority to do so” and had “exceed[ed] its jurisdiction” when it gave LEARN until July 1,\n\n2015, to satisfy the performance agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 59    Count II alleged that the Commission violated the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/1\n\net seq. (West 2014)) when it allowed two commissioners to participate telephonically without\n\nprior notice and a lawful justification. Count III alleged that the Commission violated the Open\n\nMeetings Act (id.) by holding a closed session without identifying a proper exception. Lastly,\n\ncount IV sought a declaratory judgment against all three defendants, seeking a declaration that\n\nthe Commission’s decision was clearly erroneous.\n\n¶ 60    Approximately a week later, District 60 filed an unsuccessful emergency motion to stay\n\nthe final decision of the Commission pending resolution of its lawsuit. Eventually, on June 23,\n\n2016, following several motions being filed and various briefings, the circuit court affirmed the\n\nCommission’s decision to grant LEARN’s appeal and dismissed counts II, III and IV of District\n\n60’s complaint, finding that administrative review was the sole means for District 60 to obtain\n\nrelief and the counts were “duplicative of the relief sought by way of administrative review.”\n\nDistrict 60 timely appealed. 3,4\n\n¶ 61                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 62                              A. Compliance With Supreme Court Rules\n\n¶ 63    Initially, we must address ISBE and the Commission’s contention that District 60’s\n\nopening brief violated our supreme court rules in multiple respects. While we agree that District\n\n60 violated multiple rules by not providing a citation to authority for its purported standard of\n\n\n        3\n           District 60’s notice of appeal stated that it was appealing from the circuit court’s June 23, 2016,\norder that affirmed the Commission’s decision but also from the court’s order that denied the district’s\nemergency motion for a stay. However, District 60 has not raised any arguments on appeal related to this\nmotion. Accordingly, any argument concerning the propriety of the denial of the motion has been\nforfeited on appeal. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017); Goldberg v. Rush University Medical\nCenter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604 (2007).\n         4\n           Although LEARN is a party to this appeal, it has not filed any briefs nor has it moved to adopt\nthe joint briefs of the Commission and ISBE.\n\n                                                    - 22 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nreview (Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(3) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017)), copiously arguing and failing to provide\n\nappropriate references in several places to the record on appeal in its statement of facts (Ill. S. Ct.\n\nR. 341(h)(6) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017)), and neglecting to include a complete appendix with the\n\nrequired documents (Ill. S. Ct. R. 342 (eff. July 1, 2017)), we disagree with ISBE and the\n\nCommission that we should sanction these violations by dismissing District 60’s appeal or\n\nstriking its brief. Such punishments are permissible for violating the supreme court rules, but\n\nthey are particularly harsh. North Community Bank v. 17011 South Park Ave., LLC, 2015 IL App\n\n(1st) 133672, ¶ 14. Although we do not find such a punitive sanction warranted in this case, we\n\nwill disregard any arguments raised by District 60 in its statement of facts and consider only\n\nthose properly raised in the argument section of its brief. Thus, despite District 60’s\n\nnoncompliance with the rules, we nevertheless consider the merits of its appeal.\n\n¶ 64                           B. Jurisdiction of the Commission and ISBE\n\n¶ 65   District 60 first contends that the Commission and ISBE lost jurisdiction over LEARN’s\n\nappeal and certification because they both failed to follow the timeline established by the Charter\n\nSchools Law.\n\n¶ 66   The Charter Schools Law outlines the timeline in which various actions by the\n\nCommission and ISBE should occur. 105 ILCS 5/27A-1 et seq. (West 2014). Following a public\n\nhearing on a charter school applicant’s appeal, the Commission has 30 days to vote to either\n\ngrant or deny the appeal, which must occur at a public meeting. Id. §§ 27A-8(e), (g). The statute\n\nthen provides that:\n\n       “Within 7 days of the public meeting ***, the [Commission] shall file a report\n\n       with [ISBE] granting or denying the proposal. If the [Commission] has approved\n\n       the proposal, within 30 days of receipt of the [Commission’s] report, [ISBE] shall\n\n                                                - 23 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n       determine whether the approved charter proposal is consistent with the provisions\n\n       of [the Charter Schools Law] and, if the approved proposal complies, certify the\n\n       proposal ***.” Id. § 27A-8(f), (g).\n\nAlthough section 27A-8(f) of the Charter Schools Law provides a timeline with respect to a local\n\nschool board’s approval of a charter school, section 27A-8(g) makes clear that the timeline\n\nimposed in section 27A-8(f) applies equally to when the Commission considers an appeal of a\n\ncharter school denial by the school board. See id. § 27A-8(g) (“[T]he Commission shall follow\n\nthe same process and be subject to the same timelines for review as the local school board.”).\n\n¶ 67   The parties do not dispute the timeline of events in this case. On April 21, 2015, the\n\nCommission voted at a public meeting to grant LEARN’s appeal. Eight days later, on April 29,\n\n2015, the Commission submitted the report of its vote to ISBE, who ultimately certified the\n\ncharter between LEARN and the Commission on August 27, 2015, well after the outlined 30-day\n\ntime period. According to District 60, the Commission’s noncompliance with the 7-day reporting\n\ncommand and ISBE’s noncompliance with the 30-day certification command resulted in them\n\nlosing jurisdiction over LEARN’s appeal and rendering them unable to reverse District 60’s\n\ndenial and certify the charter school, respectively. Furthermore, District 60 argues that the\n\nCommission and ISBE’s failure to comply with the timeline prejudiced the district because it\n\ncreated uncertainty in its staffing, enrollment, and budget. The Commission and ISBE respond,\n\narguing that they did not lose jurisdiction over LEARN’s appeal and certification because the\n\nstatutory language is merely directory, not mandatory.\n\n¶ 68   Whether a statutory command is directory or mandatory is a question involving statutory\n\nconstruction that we review de novo. In re M.I., 2013 IL 113776, ¶ 15. “When construing a\n\nstatute, our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent, the surest and\n\n\n                                               - 24 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nmost reliable indicator of which is the statutory language itself, given its plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning.” Id. If a “statute expressly prescribes a consequence for failure to obey a statutory\n\nprovision, that is very strong evidence the legislature intended that consequence to be\n\nmandatory.” People v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2046119\"><a href=\"/opinion/2046119/people-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (2005). Therefore, under the mandatory-\n\ndirectory dichotomy of statutory construction, it is not the use of obligatory language, such as the\n\nword “shall,” that determines whether a statutory command is mandatory or directory, but rather\n\nwhether noncompliance with such language dictates a resulting consequence. Id.\n\n¶ 69   When a procedural command to a government entity is at issue, we begin with the\n\npresumption that the command is directory. People v. Geiler, 2016 IL 119095, ¶ 18. This\n\npresumption may be overcome, and thus the procedural command read as mandatory, if “(1)\n\nnegative language in the statute or rule prohibits further action in the case of noncompliance or\n\n(2) the right the statute or rule is designed to protect would generally be injured under a directory\n\nreading.” Id. “It has long been held that statutory requisitions directed to government officials\n\ndesigned to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings are usually directory rather than\n\nmandatory.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Robinson, 217 Ill. 2d at 56. But if these\n\nrequisitions “are intended for the protection of the citizen, *** and by a disregard of which his\n\nrights might be and generally would be injuriously affected, they are not directory but\n\nmandatory.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. If the procedural command is deemed\n\nmandatory and the government entity fails to comply with the required act, we must invalidate\n\nthe government action. In re M.I., 2013 IL 113776, ¶ 16.\n\n¶ 70   In this case, we begin with the presumption that the procedural commands at issue—the\n\nCommission’s 7-day reporting command and ISBE’s 30-day certification command—are\n\ndirectory rather than mandatory. District 60 has failed to overcome this presumption. First,\n\n\n                                               - 25 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nsection 27A-8 of the Charter Schools Law (105 ILCS 5/27A-8 (West 2014)) does not utilize any\n\nnegative language prohibiting further action in the case of noncompliance nor does this section\n\ndictate a particular consequence for either the Commission or ISBE’s failure to comply with the\n\ncommands. Notably, District 60 fails to identify any language, seemingly conceding this point.\n\n¶ 71   Second, before analyzing whether a directory reading would generally injure the right the\n\nstatutory provision is designed to protect, we must determine what right the provision protects.\n\nSee In re M.I., 2013 IL 113776, ¶ 24. Our review of the legislative history of the Charter Schools\n\nLaw does not reveal an explicit right to be protected by the Commission’s 7-day reporting\n\ncommand or ISBE’s 30-day certification command. District 60, however, suggests that the\n\ntimeline is intended to protect impacted school districts and their students from uncertainty in\n\nstaffing, enrollment, and budgetary matters that result from delayed proceedings. District 60’s\n\nargument is true to a degree, as this timeline helps give local school districts, whose funding and\n\nenrollment are necessarily affected by the existence of charter schools in their districts, clarity.\n\nThe same could be said for charter school applicants themselves, who similarly have to budget\n\nlimited resources and also need clarity in the resolution of their proposals. While clarity to the\n\nparties may be a partial benefit of the timeline in the Charter Schools Law, it is only ancillary to\n\nthe true purpose of the timeline, which is to provide guidance to government officials to help\n\nexpedite proceedings and keep them moving in an orderly process. In other words, the timeline\n\ndoes not protect a specific right but rather helps ensure that the proceedings do not become\n\nunnecessarily delayed.\n\n¶ 72   Nevertheless, even giving credence to District 60’s argument that the timeline is designed\n\nto protect school districts from uncertainty in various matters, we disagree that it is a directory\n\nreading that generally causes this uncertainty. Regardless of a directory or mandatory reading of\n\n\n                                               - 26 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthe statutory timeline, there will always be uncertainty. That is simply the nature of the\n\nCommission’s appeals process or any other unresolved proceeding. The uncertainty cannot be\n\nremoved until an appeal or proceeding is resolved. Thus, District 60’s alleged uncertainty has\n\nnothing to do with a directory or mandatory reading of the statutory timeline but rather is\n\ninherent in unresolved proceedings. To the extent that District 60 argues that a directory reading\n\nexacerbates this uncertainty above and beyond the normal uncertainty produced by unresolved\n\nproceedings, we also disagree. Had the Commission missed its 7-day reporting command and\n\nISBE missed its 30-day certification command much earlier in the calendar year, for example in\n\nJanuary and February, District 60 would have no basis for arguing that these missed deadlines\n\nsomehow caused any exacerbated uncertainty for its subsequent year’s staffing, enrollment, or\n\nbudget.\n\n¶ 73      It is only because the missed deadlines occurred much closer to the beginning of the\n\nschool year that this alleged uncertainty in District 60’s operations manifested itself. Thus, while\n\nin this specific case, a directory reading of the statutory timeline might have injured a right the\n\nprovision was designed to protect, District 60 fails to convince us that this holds true under\n\ngeneral circumstances. See, e.g., Geiler, 2016 IL 119095, ¶ 23 (finding that “a defendant may be\n\nprejudiced by a Rule 552 violation if there is a lengthy delay in transmitting a citation in a given\n\ncase, but no reason exists to believe that would generally be true”); Robinson, 217 Ill. 2d at 57\n\n(finding that, “[w]hile the right to appeal might be injured by untimely service in a given case,\n\nthere is no reason to believe that it generally would be”). Moreover, District 60’s assertion that it\n\nwas prejudiced from the Commission and ISBE’s failure to comply with the timeline is belied by\n\nthe fact that it knew the Commission had voted to grant LEARN’s appeal on April 21, 2015,\n\nsubject to LEARN satisfying the performance agreement, well in advance of the beginning of the\n\n\n                                               - 27 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n2015-2016 school year. Consequently, we find that the Commission’s 7-day reporting command\n\nand ISBE’s 30-day certification command are directory.\n\n¶ 74   Furthermore, District 60’s reliance on McReynolds v. Civil Service Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 1062 (1974), is unpersuasive. In that case, the plaintiff, a state employee, was suspended\n\nwithout pay and two weeks later received a notice of discharge. Id. at 1063. The plaintiff\n\nsubsequently sought a hearing on the matter, which occurred 47 days later. Id. Following the\n\nhearing, a hearing officer recommended that the plaintiff be discharged, a recommendation that\n\nwas eventually adopted by the Civil Service Commission. Id. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a\n\ncomplaint for administrative review, arguing that the Civil Service Commission lost jurisdiction\n\nover her case because it failed to hold the hearing within 30 days of her request. Id. The statutory\n\nprovision at issue stated that, “ ‘[u]pon the filing of such a request for a hearing, the Commission\n\nshall grant a hearing within thirty days.’ ” (Emphasis omitted.) Id. at 1064 (quoting Ill. Rev. Stat.\n\n1971, ch. 127, ¶ 63b111). The circuit court agreed with the plaintiff and reversed the decision of\n\nthe Civil Service Commission. Id. at 1063. The Civil Service Commission appealed, arguing that\n\nthe 30-day command was directory, not mandatory. Id. at 1063-64.\n\n¶ 75   This court observed that the purpose of the statutory provision at issue was to provide\n\n“employees certain procedural protections when they were being considered for discharge,\n\ndemotion or suspension,” namely “a timely hearing and a speedy adjudication of disciplinary\n\ncharges.” Id. at 1065. To this end, the time limitation not only ensured “fairness to the employee\n\nbut serve[d] to prevent the employee from suffering monetary injury.” Id. at 1066. In other\n\nwords, without a mandatory reading, the employee would be unable to collect a salary, which\n\nwould always result in a direct monetary injury. Id. Thus, we found the statutory timeline was\n\nmandatory. Id. at 1067.\n\n\n                                               - 28 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 76   In contrast to McReynolds, where the timeline was intended for the protection of the\n\nemployee, in this case, the timeline is designed to ensure order and efficiency in the proceedings\n\nrather than protect a specific right. Furthermore, even accepting District 60’s argument that the\n\ntimeline is designed to protect school districts from uncertainty in various matters, the district\n\nhas only shown that a directory reading of the timeline would, in certain circumstances, injure a\n\nright the provision is designed to protect. However, in McReynolds, a directory reading of the\n\ntimeline at issue would always injure the right the provision was designed to protect.\n\nAccordingly, because the Commission’s 7-day reporting command and ISBE’s 30-day\n\ncertification command are directory, the Commission did not lose jurisdiction over LEARN’s\n\nappeal and ISBE did not lose jurisdiction over the certification of LEARN’s charter.\n\n¶ 77                          C. The Propriety of the Commission’s Decision\n\n¶ 78   District 60 next contends that, because LEARN’s proposal and supplemental information\n\non appeal did not satisfy the requirements of the Charter Schools Law, the Commission’s\n\ndecision to grant LEARN’s appeal was improper. Specifically, District 60 argues that LEARN’s\n\nproposal did not (1) identify two viable locations for the school, (2) demonstrate that the terms of\n\nthe proposed charter were economically sound for the district and the school, (3) include an\n\neducational program sufficient to meet the needs of students in the district, in particular ELL and\n\nspecial education students, (4) demonstrate the capability to meet the needs of at-risk students,\n\nand (5) demonstrate it was in the best interests of the students the school was designed to serve.\n\n¶ 79   Pursuant to the Charter Schools Law, the Commission could reverse District 60’s denial\n\nof LEARN’s proposal if it found the proposal was “in compliance with [the law]” and “in the\n\nbest interests of the students the charter school” was designed to serve. 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h)\n\n(West 2014). To be in compliance with the Charter Schools Law, a proposal must, inter alia,\n\n\n                                               - 29 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nidentify “at least 2 sites that are potentially available as a charter school facility by the time the\n\ncharter school is to open,” provide “[e]vidence that the terms of the charter as proposed are\n\neconomically sound for both the charter school and the school district,” and provide a description\n\nof the proposed school’s educational program. Id. §§ 27A-7(a)(3), (7), (9). When determining\n\nwhether a proposal is in compliance, the Commission conducts a de novo review, affording no\n\ndeference to the school board’s findings. 23 Ill. Adm. Code 650.110(d)(1) (2012). The\n\nCommission also does not have to rely on only the information contained in the initial proposal\n\nand may accept additional information on appeal. 23 Ill. Adm. Code 650.100(e) (2015). The\n\nCommission’s final decision is reviewable under the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3­\n\n101 et seq. (West 2014)). 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 80   In administrative review, we review the decision and reasoning of the administrative\n\nagency, here the Commission, not that of the circuit court. Doe Three v. Department of Public\n\nHealth, 2017 IL App (1st) 162548, ¶ 25. The applicable standard of review “depends upon\n\nwhether the question presented is one of fact, one of law, or a mixed question of fact and law.”\n\nBeggs v. Board of Education of Murphysboro Community Unit School District No. 186, 2016 IL\n\n120236, ¶ 50. The factual findings of an administrative agency are held as prima facie true and\n\ncorrect (735 ILCS 5/3-110 (West 2014)), and we will not disturb those findings unless they are\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence, which occurs only when “the opposite conclusion is\n\nclearly evident.” Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50. We review pure questions of law de novo. Id.\n\nFinally, mixed questions of law and fact “examine[ ] the legal effect of a given set of facts” or, in\n\nother words, involve whether uncontested facts have satisfied a statutory standard. Id. We review\n\nthese questions under the clearly erroneous standard. Id. Clear error occurs only “when although\n\nthere is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite\n\n\n                                                - 30 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nand firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n\n\nWe will determine the appropriate standard of review for each of District 60’s arguments in our\n\n\ndiscussion on each argument. \n\n\n¶ 81                           1. Location of the Proposed Charter School\n\n\n¶ 82    We begin with District 60’s argument that LEARN’s proposal was deficient because it\n\n\ndid not identify two “viable” locations for the charter school. District 60 asserts that, during the\n\n\nproceedings, facilities that had been identified by LEARN were taken out of consideration for\n\n\nvarious reasons and highlights that the eventual location of the charter school was not even \n\n\namong the locations identified in LEARN’s initial proposal nor the supplemental locations\n\n\nsubmitted to the Commission on appeal. Based on this, District 60 concludes that “LEARN did \n\n\nnot submit even one potential viable site” for the location of the charter school.\n\n\n¶ 83   Under section 27A-7(a)(3) of the Charter Schools Law, the proposal must include:\n\n\n       “A description of and address for the physical plant in which the charter school\n\n       will be located; provided that nothing in the Article shall be deemed to justify\n\n       delaying or withholding favorable action on or approval of a charter school\n\n       proposal because the building or buildings in which the charter school is to be\n\n       located have not been acquired or rented at the time a charter school proposal is\n\n       submitted or approved or a charter school contract is entered into or submitted for\n\n       certification or certified, so long as the proposal or submission identifies and\n\n       names at least 2 sites that are potentially available as a charter school facility by\n\n       the time the charter school is to open.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-7(a)(3) (West 2014).\n\nDistrict 60 does not contest that LEARN identified two sites in its proposal and identified two\n\nadditional sites in its memorandum on appeal to the Commission but rather seemingly contests\n\n                                               - 31 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nwhether these facts satisfied the statutory standard. Thus, we review this issue under the clearly-\n\nerroneous standard. See Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50.\n\n¶ 84   In LEARN’s proposal to District 60, it identified two locations for the charter school, one\n\nat 2634 Grand Avenue and the other at 2700 North Belvidere Road. The proposal provided a\n\ndescription of the locations, discussed the options available for acquiring use of them, and briefly\n\ndetailed the improvements necessary for them to operate as a school. Upon appeal to the\n\nCommission, LEARN provided a memorandum and identified two additional locations, one at\n\n800 South Genesee Street and the other at 202 North Genesee Street. LEARN also provided a\n\ndescription of the locations and briefly detailed the improvements necessary for them to operate\n\nas a school. The memorandum suggested that the newly identified locations were more feasible\n\nthan the ones identified in the proposal to District 60. During the pendency of LEARN’s appeal\n\nbefore the Commission, various documents detailed the feasibility of, and issues associated with,\n\noperating a charter school at the locations identified by LEARN.\n\n¶ 85   Based on this information, the Commission’s written decision observed that, upon further\n\ndue diligence by LEARN on all four locations, 2634 Grand Avenue was no longer viable due to\n\nprohibitive costs and 2700 North Belvidere Road would require a longer conversion process.\n\nDespite the longer conversion process at 2700 North Belvidere Road, the Commission concluded\n\nthat LEARN had still identified “three viable facilities” for the charter school, which satisfied the\n\nrequirement of the Charter Schools Law to identify two sites that were potentially available.\n\n¶ 86   We agree with the Commission that LEARN satisfied the statutory standard. While\n\nLEARN ultimately did not select any of the four locations for the eventual home of its school,\n\nnothing in the Charter Schools Law requires this. Despite District 60’s assertion that, at the time\n\nof the Commission’s public meeting, only the property at 800 South Genesee Street was still\n\n\n                                               - 32 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nbeing considered by LEARN, we do not find it unfathomable that, after a charter school\n\napplicant has identified potential locations, further due diligence would reveal those locations as\n\nunsuitable for a multitude of rational reasons. The critical fact is that, at the time LEARN\n\nsubmitted its proposal to District 60 and at the time it submitted its memorandum to the\n\nCommission on appeal, LEARN had identified at least two locations in each submission that\n\nwere “potentially available,” the only standard the Charter Schools Law requires. See 105 ILCS\n\n5/27A-7(a)(3) (West 2014). Nothing in the record on appeal demonstrates that the locations were\n\nunavailable for use when LEARN proposed them. Therefore, we are not left with a definite and\n\nfirm conviction that the Commission committed a mistake in finding that LEARN satisfied this\n\nstatutory requirement. Accordingly, the Commission’s finding was proper.\n\n¶ 87                                 2. Economic Soundness\n\n¶ 88   District 60 next argues that LEARN failed to demonstrate the terms of the proposed\n\ncharter were economically sound for both the district and the school. Concerning itself, District\n\n60 asserts that, during the public meeting on LEARN’s appeal, the commissioners focused their\n\ndiscussion on the impact on LEARN of funding the school at 91% or 100% of the district’s per\n\ncapita tuition charge, but neglected to discuss how it would impact the district itself. District 60\n\nfurther posits that the record is devoid of any sound economic analysis of the proposed charter\n\nschool’s impact on the district. Concerning LEARN, District 60 asserts that LEARN failed to\n\ndemonstrate that it was fiscally capable of operating a school in Waukegan, especially in light of\n\nthe additional responsibilities it would have as a local educational agency.\n\n¶ 89   Before discussing the Charter Schools Law requirement of economic soundness, it is\n\nimportant to understanding generally how a charter school is funded. As previously mentioned, a\n\ncharter school is a tuition-free public school (id. §§ 27A-5(a), (e); Comprehensive Community,\n\n\n                                               - 33 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n216 Ill. 2d at 458), but how the school is funded depends on who is its authorizer. When a local\n\nschool board approves a charter school proposal, it becomes the authorizer. 105 ILCS 5/27A-6(a)\n\n(West 2014). In such cases, part of the funding for the charter school is determined by an\n\nagreement between the local school board and the charter school based on a percentage (at the\n\ntime, 75% to 125%) of the local school district’s per capita tuition charge multiplied by the\n\nnumber of students enrolled in the charter school who reside in the district. Id. § 27A-11(b).\n\n¶ 90   However, when a local school board denies a charter school proposal and the\n\nCommission subsequently grants the appeal, the Commission becomes the school’s authorizer.\n\nId. § 27A-9(f). In such cases, the Commission determines the level of funding, also using a\n\npercentage of the local school district’s per capita tuition charge multiplied by the number of\n\nstudents enrolled in the charter school who reside in the district, but the school obtains the\n\nfunding directly from ISBE. See id. (stating that ISBE “shall withhold from funds otherwise due\n\nthe district the funds authorized by [the Charter Schools Law] to be paid to the charter school\n\nand shall pay such amounts to the charter school”). Thus, regardless of who authorizes the\n\ncharter school, funding that normally would go to a district’s traditional schools is diverted to the\n\ncharter school.\n\n¶ 91   Now turning to District 60’s economic soundness argument, under section 27A-7(a)(9) of\n\nthe Charter Schools Law, a charter school proposal must include “[e]vidence that the terms of the\n\ncharter as proposed are economically sound for both the charter school and the school district.”\n\nId. § 27A-7(a)(9). Although what constitutes economic soundness is not explained in the\n\nregulations, our supreme court has defined the term as meaning “ ‘financial security’ or\n\n‘solvency.’ ” Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 477 (quoting Webster’s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 2177 (1986)). In Comprehensive Community, our supreme court stated\n\n\n                                               - 34 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthat the entity proposing the charter school must not only present evidence that the school would\n\nbe financially sound, but also that the district would remain financially secure and solvent with\n\nthe presence of the charter school. Id. Thus, the local school district’s finances must be\n\nconsidered in any analysis. Id. However, economic soundness “is not a bright-line standard, but\n\nrather a continuum.” Id. at 481. “The terms of some charter school proposals will be more\n\neconomically sound for a school district than other proposals, depending upon their effects on\n\nthe district’s bottom line.” Id.\n\n¶ 92    District 60 does not appear to dispute any of the factual findings of the Commission on its\n\nfinances or LEARN’s but rather asserts that, despite these facts, LEARN’s proposal did not\n\ndemonstrate economic soundness. In this regard, we view the issue presented as a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact, as we must determine whether the established facts have satisfied the\n\nstatutory standard. Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50. On such questions, we review for clear error.\n\nId.; see also Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 477-78 (reviewing for clear error whether\n\na charter school proposal satisfied the economic soundness requirement when the main facts of\n\nthe local school district’s finances were not in dispute). On mixed questions of law and fact, we\n\ngive significant deference to the Commission’s findings, as it has the experience in construing\n\nand applying the Charter Schools Law. Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 472.\n\n¶ 93    In the Commission’s written decision, it found that, based on all of the documentation\n\nsubmitted in the appeal, LEARN had a lengthy track record of operating financially sound\n\ncharter schools, had been successful in fundraising, and its assets exceeded its liabilities.\n\nFurthermore, during the public meeting, LEARN’s CEO, Gregory White, answered questions\n\nfrom the commissioners. One commissioner asked White about LEARN’s cash reserves, and\n\nWhite responded that LEARN had 45 days of cash reserves, which was sufficient to “support any\n\n\n                                              - 35 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nschool that may be falling down, as far as the finances.” The Commission’s written decision also\n\nobserved that LEARN had “put forward a comprehensive plan *** to suggest that it has the\n\noperational capacity” to operate as its own local educational agency and had submitted a\n\nsatisfactory budget to operate as one.\n\n¶ 94   Concerning District 60’s finances, in the Commission’s written decision, it found that\n\nfunding the proposed charter school at 100% of the district’s per capita tuition charge “did not\n\nmaterially harm” District 60 or impact its financial solvency, as LEARN’s impact on the\n\ndistrict’s total budget would range from less than 1% in 2016 to slightly more than 2% in 2020.\n\nMoreover, during the public meeting, one of the commissioners asked if District 60’s 2015\n\nbudget was accurate concerning a $7.3 million deficit in its educational fund and a $2.8 million\n\ndeficit in its operations maintenance fund. A representative of District 60 responded that the\n\nfigures were accurate, adding that the operations maintenance fund included capital costs, which\n\nwould not decrease in the future due to the district’s use of older buildings. The representative\n\nexplained the chief cause of the deficits was decreasing property taxes in the district. She also\n\nstated that, due to these deficits, District 60 had already made various “cuts.” The commissioner\n\npointed out that, in all likelihood due to District 60’s financial position, its per capita tuition\n\ncharge would decrease, which LEARN would need to consider in its own budgetary analysis.\n\nAdditionally during the public meeting, the commissioners spent time addressing issues related\n\nto funding the charter school at 91% and 100% of District 60’s per capita tuition charge and the\n\nimpact on both parties. At one point during the meeting, a commissioner stated “there is\n\nevidence” that funding the charter school at 91% or 100% of District 60’s per capita tuition\n\ncharge “would cause harm to [District 60] *** given [its] financial situation.” The commissioner\n\nadded that this was a “concern” of his.\n\n\n                                              - 36 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 95   In this case, the record plainly shows that the Commission reviewed the relevant financial\n\ninformation and considered not only the financial feasibility of the proposed charter school, as\n\nsupported in part by LEARN, but also District 60’s finances. Critically, we give significant\n\ndeference to the Commission’s findings on these matters, as it has the experience in construing\n\nand applying the Charter Schools Law. See Comprehensive Community, 216 Ill. 2d at 472. This\n\nis so because the Commission is comprised of members who “collectively possess strong\n\nexperience and expertise in public and nonprofit governance, management and finance, public\n\nschool leadership, higher education, assessments, curriculum and instruction, and public\n\neducation law.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-7.5(d) (West 2014). Given the fact that the Commission\n\npossesses the superior knowledge in analyzing the relevant economics of schools compared to\n\nus, nothing in this record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that the Commission\n\ncommitted a mistake in finding that LEARN satisfied the economic-soundness requirement.\n\n¶ 96   Nevertheless, District 60 posits that the Commission failed to complete a “sound\n\neconomic analysis” of the charter school proposal and claims that the Commission’s staff\n\nadmitted as much at the public meeting. At that meeting, Hosanna Mahaley-Jones, the interim\n\nexecutive director of the Commission, informed the commissioners that the staff did not obtain a\n\n“second [financial] analysis with our independent consultants” on LEARN’s proposal, an\n\nanalysis the staff generally obtained in other appeals. However, Mahaley-Jones explained that\n\nthe staff only had a set amount of money “to fund an appeal,” and it had to use those resources to\n\ninvestigate other concerns of District 60, including Dr. Ditkowsky’s analysis of the academic\n\nperformance of LEARN’s schools. Although the staff did not obtain an independent financial\n\nanalysis of LEARN’s proposal, it is clear that, based on Mahaley-Jones’s statements and other\n\nparts of the record, the staff conducted its own detailed financial analysis. District 60’s claim\n\n\n                                              - 37 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\notherwise is therefore without merit. Accordingly, the Commission did not commit clear error\n\nand its finding on economic soundness was proper.\n\n¶ 97                                 3. Educational Program\n\n¶ 98   District 60 next argues that LEARN’s proposed educational program was insufficient to\n\nserve the needs of the students in the district, in particular ELL and special education students.\n\nDistrict 60 asserts that, at the time the Commission held its public meeting, there was no\n\nevidence that LEARN had begun to develop a comprehensive special education program, had the\n\ncapacity to function as its own local educational agency, or had the experience and ability to\n\noperate a robust ELL program. As District 60’s argument essentially contests the factual findings\n\nby the Commission on LEARN’s educational plan, we review this question under the manifest-\n\nweight standard, reversing only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident. See Beggs, 2016 IL\n\n120236, ¶ 50.\n\n¶ 99   Under section 27A-7(a)(5) and (a)(7) of the Charter Schools Law, the charter school\n\nproposal must include “[t]he goals, objectives, and pupil performance standards to be achieved\n\nby the charter school” and “[a] description of the charter school’s educational program, pupil\n\nperformance standards, curriculum, school year, school days, and hours of operation.” 105 ILCS\n\n5/27A-7(a)(5), (7) (West 2014). Furthermore, charter schools must comply with all federal and\n\nstate laws and regulations “applicable to public schools that pertain to special education and the\n\ninstruction of [ELL students].” Id. § 27A-5(g).\n\n¶ 100 LEARN’s original proposal included information about how it would support and enrich\n\nthe learning of traditional students, as well as ELL students and special education students. Upon\n\nappealing to the Commission and realizing that if its appeal was granted, it would operate as its\n\nown local educational agency, LEARN submitted additional information on how it would\n\n                                              - 38 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nsupport ELL and special education students. Based on this information, in the Commission’s\n\nwritten decision, it found that LEARN’s educational plan would follow the Common Core\n\nstandards but would be supplemented with a curriculum that had “been heavily researched” and\n\nshown to have “strong positive growth for all student demographic groups, including\n\neducationally disadvantaged minority, low-income, and ELL populations.” The Commission’s\n\ndecision also stated that, based on LEARN’s proposal and the additional information submitted\n\non appeal, its staff and an independent evaluator visited LEARN’s North Chicago campus,\n\ndirectly observed classroom instruction, and interviewed ELL students and the ELL coordinator.\n\nFrom this, the Commission concluded that the school culture and climate at the North Chicago\n\ncampus were “conducive to learning,” the “academic performance and growth by ELL and\n\nspecial education students” were “proficient,” and the ELL coordinator was “knowledgeable,\n\nexperienced and had a vision for an ELL program across campuses.”\n\n¶ 101 The Commission further found that LEARN would place students requiring “Individual\n\nEducation Plans in the least restrictive environment,” which meant accommodating those\n\nstudents first in the general classroom, but if necessary through “self-contained/resource rooms\n\nwith learning resource teachers.” Additionally, the Commission highlighted that LEARN\n\nemployed “a full range of specialists,” including occupational therapists, physical therapists,\n\nspeech and language therapists, social workers, counselors, and psychologists.\n\n¶ 102 District 60, in essence, asks us to find LEARN’s educational plan, especially as it relates\n\nto ELL and special education students, insufficient despite the Commission, who has the\n\nexpertise and experience in reviewing and evaluating these precise matters, finding the plan\n\nsufficient. When reviewing the findings of fact from an administrative agency, we cannot simply\n\nreweigh the evidence and substitute our judgment in for that of the agency. Abrahamson v.\n\n\n                                             - 39 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nIllinois Department of Professional Regulation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036009\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036009/abrahamson-v-illinois-dept-of-pro-reg/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (1992). Nothing in LEARN’s\n\nproposal or its supplemental information submitted on appeal demonstrates to us that the\n\nopposite conclusion reached by the Commission is clearly evident. Accordingly, the Commission\n\nproperly found that LEARN had proposed a sufficient educational program for its Waukegan\n\ncampus and in particular for ELL and special education students.\n\n¶ 103                                    4. At-Risk Students\n\n¶ 104 District 60 next argues that the Commission did not have adequate support to find that\n\nLEARN would sufficiently serve at-risk students. Specifically, District 60 asserts that the\n\nCommission ignored evidence from the district that the levels of truancy at LEARN’s schools\n\nwere significantly higher than the district and three to four times higher than the statewide\n\naverage. District 60 appears to base this argument on Dr. Ditkowsky’s report, which was based\n\non data from the Illinois Report Card.\n\n¶ 105 In enacting the Charter Schools Law, our legislature declared that one of the law’s\n\npurposes was “[t]o increase learning opportunities for all pupils, with special emphasis on\n\nexpanded learning experiences for at-risk pupils,” which are defined as students “who, because\n\nof physical, emotional, socioeconomic, or cultural factors, [are] less likely to succeed in a\n\nconventional educational environment.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-2(b)(2), 27A-3 (West 2014). As\n\nDistrict 60’s argument contests the factual findings by the Commission on LEARN’s ability to\n\nmeet the needs of at-risk students, we review this question under the manifest-weight standard,\n\nreversing only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident. See Beggs, 2016 IL 120236, ¶ 50.\n\n¶ 106   In the Commission’s written decision, it found that LEARN’s “academic performance\n\noverall is worth special note given that LEARN serves a high-needs student population.” The\n\nCommission also determined that its “staff found that LEARN’s academic performance in its\n\n                                               - 40 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nnetwork of eight existing schools exceeded Waukegan District 60’s performance and that\n\nLEARN’s superior performance could be observed overall, and with respect to low income and\n\nat-risk students.” District 60 essentially argues that, because Dr. Ditkowsky’s report showed a\n\nstatistically higher level of chronic truancy at LEARN’s schools compared to District 60’s\n\nschools and the statewide average, that alone forecloses the possibility that LEARN could\n\nsufficiently serve at-risk students. The Commission did not find that such a conclusion was\n\nwarranted.\n\n¶ 107 First, in a document submitted to the Commission on appeal, LEARN responded to Dr.\n\nDitkowsky’s report, acknowledging that over one-third of its Chicago students had chronic\n\ntruancy, but noted its “[a]ttendance data,” also from the Illinois Report Card, showed its students\n\nattended school at a higher rate than District 60’s students and the statewide average. Here, the\n\nCommission was faced with conflicting evidence on truancy and attendance data, and it was the\n\nCommission’s responsibility to weigh the evidence and resolve the apparent conflict. See\n\nPlowman v. Department of Children & Family Services, 2017 IL App (1st) 160860, ¶ 24. The\n\nCommission did just that, as its decision indicated that its staff “conducted an independent study\n\nto review” the concerns raised in Dr. Ditkowsky’s report. The Commission’s study not only\n\nconcluded that the concerns were unsupported by the data but also “reaffirmed LEARN’s high\n\nquality performance on the vast majority of metrics.”\n\n¶ 108 Second, even if LEARN’s truancy data reflected negatively on its schools, this is only\n\none measure in determining whether a charter school can adequately serve the needs of at-risk\n\nstudents. The Commission’s decision focused primarily on the academic success of LEARN’s\n\nstudents, who, despite being comprised of high populations of at-risk students, generally\n\noutperformed District 60’s students in ISAT testing. Nothing in the record demonstrates to us\n\n\n                                              - 41 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthat an opposite conclusion than that reached by the Commission is clearly evident. Accordingly,\n\nthe Commission properly found that LEARN could sufficiently meet the needs of at-risk students\n\nat its proposed Waukegan campus.\n\n¶ 109                            5. Best Interests of the Students\n\n¶ 110 Although we have rejected District 60’s arguments concerning whether the Commission\n\nproperly found that LEARN’s proposal was in compliance with the statutory requirements of the\n\nCharter Schools Law, the district lastly argues that the Commission erroneously found that\n\nLEARN’s proposal was in the best interests of the students the charter school was intended to\n\nserve. In support, District 60 asserts that, at the Commission’s public meeting, it did not discuss\n\nwhether the proposal was in the best interests of the students and its written decision merely\n\ncontained “boilerplate conclusory statements” on the issue. District 60 posits that the\n\nCommission had no basis for finding the proposal was in the best interests of the students.\n\n¶ 111 As previously discussed, the Commission may only reverse a local school board’s\n\ndecision to deny a charter school proposal if the Commission finds that the proposal (1) “is in\n\ncompliance with” the Charter Schools Law and (2) “in the best interests of the students the\n\ncharter school is designed to serve.” 105 ILCS 5/27A-8(h) (West 2014). Although the\n\nregulations do not expound on this requirement, this court has previously examined the\n\nrequirement by focusing on the overall purpose of the Charter Schools Law, i.e., a means to\n\nprovide alternative public education models that are innovative and flexible. Board of Education\n\nof Rich Township High School District No. 227 v. Illinois State Board of Education, 2011 IL\n\nApp (1st) 110182, ¶¶ 101-104 (citing 105 ILCS 5/27A-2(a)(2) (West 2008)). We review whether\n\nthe Commission properly found LEARN’s proposal was in the best interests of the students it\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 42 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nwas designed to serve for clear error, deferring significantly to the Commission because of its\n\nexperience in construing and applying the statute. Id. ¶ 100.\n\n¶ 112 In the Commission’s written decision, it asserted that LEARN provided evidence that it\n\nhad “the capacity to provide Waukegan public school student[s] with a high quality education\n\noption that is not currently available to them,” especially given LEARN’s demonstrated past\n\nsuccess in operating charter schools. The Commission based this finding on its staff’s\n\n“independent analysis” of LEARN’s proposal, which focused on LEARN’s educational plan,\n\norganizational plan, business plan, and “evidence of capacity.” The staff’s analysis determined\n\nthat the academic success of LEARN’s schools “exceeded Waukegan District 60’s performance\n\nand that LEARN’s superior performance could be observed overall, and with respect to low\n\nincome and at-risk students.” Further, the staff acknowledged that LEARN’s experience with\n\nELL students was limited, but found that the ELL students at its North Chicago campus “greatly\n\noutperformed both Waukegan District 60 and the State ELL reading average.” The staff also\n\nbelieved that LEARN’s organizational plan, business plan and the capacity of LEARN to execute\n\non the plans met or exceeded the standards required by law.\n\n¶ 113 In light of the Commission’s findings, LEARN has demonstrated that the innovation it\n\nimplements into the classroom has resulted in minority and low-income students excelling in\n\nacademic performance as compared to their peer groups. As of the 2013-2014 school year, 72%\n\nof District 60’s students were low-income, 77% were Hispanic and 16% were black. These\n\nstudents deserve the opportunity to attend a school operated by LEARN, an organization that has\n\nproven to be adept at teaching minority and low-income students, improving their academic\n\nperformance, and providing them with the academic foundation and ambition to attend college.\n\nFurthermore, merely because the commissioners never directly discussed the “best interests”\n\n\n                                               - 43 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nfactor during the public meeting does not mean their ultimate vote to grant LEARN’s appeal was\n\nflawed. During the meeting, the commissioners discussed several aspects of LEARN’s proposal,\n\nand although the words “best interests” were never uttered, this undefined concept was clearly\n\nrelated to various discussions the commissioners had. Moreover, based on the Commission’s\n\nwritten decision, it is clear that the Commission analyzed this factor. Therefore, the\n\nCommission’s conclusion that LEARN’s proposal was in the best interests of the students the\n\nschool was designed to serve was not clearly erroneous.\n\n¶ 114 In sum, the Commission properly found that LEARN’s proposal was in compliance with\n\nthe requirements of the Charter Schools Law and in the best interests of the students the school\n\nwas designed to serve.\n\n¶ 115                                       D. Due Process\n\n¶ 116 District 60 next raises two due process challenges to the proceedings in front of the\n\nCommission. First, District 60 contends that the Commission improperly set conditions for\n\ngranting LEARN’s appeal, i.e., the performance agreement. Second, District 60 contends that the\n\nCommission’s approval of these conditions was made without providing the district an\n\nopportunity to review or address the adequacy of LEARN’s alleged compliance.\n\n¶ 117 The United States and Illinois Constitutions protect people against “governmental\n\ndeprivations of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” Village of Vernon Hills v.\n\nHeelan, 2015 IL 118170, ¶ 31 (citing U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 2).\n\nThere are two types of due process: substantive and procedural. In re Marriage of Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2050857\"><a href=\"/opinion/2050857/in-re-marriage-of-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 185, 197 (2007). “Whereas procedural due process governs the procedures employed to deny\n\na person’s life, liberty or property interest, substantive due process limits the state’s ability to act,\n\nirrespective of the procedural protections provided.” Id. In District 60’s brief, it does not state\n\n                                                 - 44 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nwhich type of due process claim it is bringing, but based on its arguments, it is clear that its due\n\nprocess claim is procedural in nature as the district assails the fairness of the procedures used by\n\nthe Commission. Whether a party’s procedural due process rights have been violated presents a\n\nlegal question we review de novo. Heelan, 2015 IL 118170, ¶ 31.\n\n¶ 118 Although due process concerns permeate in administrative proceedings (Abrahamson,\n\n153 Ill. 2d at 92), the Commission and ISBE argue that District 60 cannot assert a due process\n\nclaim against the state given that it is itself a state entity. District 60 does not respond to this\n\nargument, and we agree with the Commission and ISBE.\n\n¶ 119 District 60, as a school board, is a governmental agency, or rather a “ ‘municipal\n\ncorporation,’ created by the legislature and subject to its will.” East St. Louis Federation of\n\nTeachers, Local 1220 v. East St. Louis School District No. 189 Financial Oversight Panel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2229846\"><a href=\"/opinion/2229846/east-st-louis-federation-of-teachers-local-1220-v-e-st-louis-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412-13 (1997). Because school boards are created by statute, they are offices entirely\n\nunder “the control of the legislature, ‘which may at pleasure create or abolish them,’ ” as well as\n\nmodify their duties. Id. at 413 (quoting Hughes v. Traeger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 616 (1914)). “The\n\nState’s control over units of local government is without regard to due process guarantees,” and\n\n“[t]he school board as an entity, therefore, cannot assert due process claims against the state.” Id.\n\nConsequently, District 60, as a school board, cannot assert due process claims against the\n\nCommission, an entity of the state. See id. Accordingly, both of District 60’s procedural due\n\nprocess claims fail.\n\n¶ 120                                 E. Open Meetings Act\n\n¶ 121 District 60 next contends that the Commission committed multiple violations of the Open\n\nMeetings Act (Act) (5 ILCS 120/1 et seq. (West 2014)) during its April 21, 2015, public meeting\n\nwhere it voted to grant LEARN’s appeal. Specifically, District 60 argues that (1) the chairman of\n\n                                               - 45 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nthe Commission, Greg Richmond, incorrectly asserted that all nine commissioners were present\n\nwhen only seven members were physically present, (2) the Commission improperly allowed two\n\ncommissioners to vote telephonically without properly justifying their absence, (3) the\n\nCommission improperly utilized a roll call vote rather than a voice vote during the vote to allow\n\nthe two commissioners’ remote attendance, and (4) the Commission went into a closed session\n\nbased on a motion that failed to sufficiently identify the exception in the Act allowing for a\n\nclosed session. Based on these alleged violations, District 60 asserts that it was prejudiced and\n\nthe proper remedy, and only one requested, is to render the Commission’s decision to grant\n\nLEARN’s appeal “null and void.”\n\n¶ 122 The Act represents a public policy initiative by our legislature that public bodies of the\n\nstate, whose activities directly impact the lives of the citizens, should deliberate and take action\n\nin the open rather than in private. Id. § 1. To this end, the Act requires that “[a]ll meetings of\n\npublic bodies” must be open to the public unless a specific exception applies. Id. § 2(a). A\n\n“meeting” is defined as “any gathering, whether in person or by video or audio conference,\n\ntelephone call, *** of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held for the\n\npurpose of discussing public business.” Id. § 1.02. A “public body” means “all legislative,\n\nexecutive, administrative or advisory bodies of the State *** and all other municipal\n\ncorporations, boards, bureaus, committees or commissions of this State.” Id. The provisions of\n\nthe Act must be “strictly construed against closed meetings” (id. § 1(2)), and all final actions\n\nmade by a public body be must be done in an open meeting. Id. § 2(e).\n\n¶ 123 When a public body fails to comply with the provisions of the Act, “any person” may\n\nbring a civil action in the circuit court alleging noncompliance (id. § 3(a)), which is how District\n\n60 proceeded in this case. Although District 60, as a school board, could not assert due process\n\n\n                                               - 46 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nclaims against the Commission (see East St. Louis Federation, 178 Ill. 2d at 412-13), a “person,”\n\nas defined by the Act, has been interpreted broadly. In Paxson v. Board of Education of School\n\nDistrict No. 87, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 916, 918, 921 (1995), this court found that, consistent with\n\nthe Act’s purpose of requiring public bodies to act openly, the term a “person” should not be\n\nlimited to only individuals, but rather should incorporate “a body politic.” District 60, as a school\n\nboard, is a body politic (see 105 ILCS 5/10-2 (West 2014)), and thus can allege violations of the\n\nAct. If the circuit court determines that a violation has occurred, it:\n\n       “may grant such relief as it deems appropriate, including granting a relief by\n\n       mandamus requiring that a meeting be open to the public, granting an injunction\n\n       against future violations of this Act, ordering the public body to make available to\n\n       the public such portion of the minutes of a meeting as is not authorized to be kept\n\n       confidential under this Act, or declaring null and void any final action taken at a\n\n       closed meeting in violation of this Act.” 5 ILCS 120/3(c) (West 2014).\n\n¶ 124 Although the circuit court’s power to grant a remedy for violations of the Act is\n\ndiscretionary and ordinarily reviewed for an abuse of discretion (see Parker v. Nichting, 2012 IL\n\nApp (3d) 100206, ¶ 15), here, the circuit court did not dismiss District 60’s counts of alleged\n\nviolations of the Act on the merits. Because the court did not address the alleged violations of the\n\nAct on their merits and thus did not utilize its discretion to grant or deny a remedy available\n\nunder the Act, we will review the Commission’s alleged violations de novo.\n\n¶ 125 We first note that District 60 does not dispute that the Commission’s vote to grant\n\nLEARN’s appeal was a final action and that the vote occurred during an open session. And, of\n\nall the alleged violations of the Act, none of them concern a final action taken by the\n\nCommission in a closed session. The Act expressly states that the circuit court may only declare\n\n\n                                                - 47 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n“null and void any final action taken at a closed meeting in violation of this Act.” 5 ILCS\n\n120/3(c) (West 2014); see also Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees v. Martin, 309 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 924, 936 (1999) (finding that, because the selection of a principal occurred at an open\n\nmeeting, a party could not request nullification of that action because it was both “too extreme\n\nand not supported by the Open Meetings Act”); Williamson v. Doyle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300\n\n(1983) (finding that the provision in a prior version of the Act “permitting the court to declare\n\nthe action void refers by its terms only to a ‘closed session’ ”). Thus, assuming arguendo that the\n\nCommission committed the alleged violations of the Act, we find that, based on the language of\n\nthe Act, District 60’s requested relief—declaring the Commission’s decision to grant LEARN’s\n\nappeal null and void—is improper.\n\n¶ 126 Our conclusion is buttressed by the Act’s legislative history. Prior to 1981, what is now\n\nknown as the Act was called “AN ACT in relation to meetings.” 1957 Ill. Laws 2892 (adding Ill.\n\nRev. Stat. 1957, ch. 102, ¶ 41); Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 102, ¶ 41. In this previous version of the\n\nAct, the only civil remedy the circuit court could issue upon a violation or anticipated violation\n\nof the Act was “a writ of mandamus requiring that a meeting be open to the public at large or\n\nissue such other appropriate order as will insure compliance with the provisions of this Act.” Ill.\n\nRev. Stat. 1979, ch. 102, ¶ 43. However, Public Act 82-378 (eff. Jan. 1, 1982) (amending Ill.\n\nRev. Stat. 1979, ch. 102, ¶ 43) changed the civil remedies available for the circuit court to issue.\n\nAs a result of the public act, upon a violation or anticipated violation of the Act:\n\n       “The court, having due regard for orderly administration and the public interest,\n\n       as well as for the interests of the parties, may grant such equitable relief as it\n\n       deems appropriate, including issuance of a writ of mandamus requiring that a\n\n       meeting be open to the public, granting an injunction against future violations of\n\n\n                                                - 48 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n       this Act, ordering the public body to make available to the public such portion of\n\n       the minutes of a meeting as is not authorized to be kept confidential under this\n\n       Act, or declaring null and void any final action taken at a closed session in\n\n       violation of this Act.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 102, ¶ 43(c).\n\nThe 1981 version of the statute is substantially the same as the current version.\n\n¶ 127 During discussions of House Bill 411, which ultimately became Public Act 82-378 (eff.\n\nJan. 1, 1982), in the House of Representatives, Representative Reilly stated that the bill “clarifies\n\nthat action taken in closed session and only that action taken in closed session can be voided.”\n\n82nd Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 20, 1981, at 31 (statements of Representative\n\nReilly). Representative Reilly later stated that “[t]he intent is to invalidate only final action\n\nimproperly taken in secret” and “only the action that takes place in the closed meeting can be\n\nvoided not action that takes place in the open meeting.” Id. at 34, 59. It is clear that, based on the\n\nlegislative history of the Act, the circuit court’s power to declare a final action null and void is\n\nlimited to only those situations where a final action occurred during a closed meeting.\n\nAccordingly, even if District 60 could persuade us that the Commission committed multiple\n\nviolations of the Act, we would not grant the district its requested relief.\n\n¶ 128 Lastly, we note that District 60 could have followed the procedure set forth in section 3.5\n\nof the Act and initiated a request for review with the “Public Access Counselor” of the Office of\n\nthe Attorney General. 5 ILCS 120/3.5 (West 2014). Under this means of review, the Attorney\n\nGeneral reviews whether a violation of the Act has occurred and then issues a binding opinion on\n\nthe matter. Id. § 3.5(e); see also American Federation of State, County, & Municipal Employees,\n\nCouncil 31 v. Illinois Labor Relations Board, 2017 IL App (5th) 160046, ¶ 27 (“After review,\n\nthe Attorney General must issue a binding opinion.”). In that binding opinion, the Attorney\n\n\n                                                - 49 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\nGeneral can direct the public body to take appropriate actions (5 ILCS 120/3.5(e) (West 2014);\n\nAmerican Federation, 2017 IL App (5th) 160046, ¶ 27), including voiding final actions taken in\n\nopen meetings. See, e.g., 2016 Ill. Att’y Gen. Pub. Access Op. No. 16-015 (after finding that the\n\nBoard of Trustees of the Village of Caseyville violated the Act by voting to amend and approve a\n\nsettlement agreement without providing proper public notice, the Attorney General voided the\n\noriginal vote and directed the board of trustees to reconsider the matter at a properly noticed\n\nmeeting); 2013 Ill. Att’y Gen. Pub. Access Op. No. 13-002 (after finding that the Chicago Park\n\nDistrict Board of Commissioners violated the Act by voting to increase fees for admission to two\n\nmuseums without providing proper public notice, the Attorney General voided the original vote\n\nand directed the board of commissioners to reconsider the matter at a properly noticed meeting).\n\n¶ 129 Had District 60 sought a remedy under section 3.5 of the Act (5 ILCS 120/3.5 (West\n\n2014)) with the Public Access Counselor originally rather than initiating an action in the circuit\n\ncourt under section 3 of the Act (id. § 3), the Attorney General may have voided the\n\nCommission’s vote on LEARN’s appeal upon a finding of noncompliance with the Act.\n\nHowever, District 60 instead sought a remedy in the circuit court that it had no power to grant\n\nbecause the formal vote on the matter occurred during a public meeting. As a result, we have no\n\nchoice but to reject its argument concerning the Commission’s alleged violations of the Act.\n\nAlthough the circuit court dismissed the counts of District 60’s complaint related to alleged\n\nviolations of the Act for different reasons, the counts were properly dismissed. See Vantage\n\nHospitality Group, Inc. v. Q Ill Development, LLC, 2016 IL App (4th) 160271, ¶ 54 (the\n\nappellate court may affirm the circuit court’s judgment on any basis supported by the record).\n\n¶ 130                          F. Dismissal of Remaining Counts\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 50 ­\n\fNo. 1-16-2084\n\n¶ 131 District 60 lastly contends that the other counts in its complaint should not have been\n\n\ndismissed. However, the district’s arguments center around the improper dismissal of its claims\n\n\nconcerning the Commission’s alleged violations of the Act. As we have already discussed this\n\n\nissue in our foregoing analysis, we need not discuss it any further. But to the extent District 60\n\n\nhas challenged the propriety of the circuit court’s dismissal of count IV of its complaint—the\n\n\ncount which sought a declaratory judgment against LEARN, the Commission and ISBE—we \n\n\nfind any such challenge forfeited for failing to cite any legal authority or develop a coherent legal\n\n\nargument. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017). \n\n\n¶ 132                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n\n¶ 133 Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County, \n\n\nwhich had affirmed the decision of the Commission and dismissed counts II, III, and IV of\n\n\nDistrict 60’s complaint. \n\n\n¶ 134 Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 51 ­\n\f</pre>",
