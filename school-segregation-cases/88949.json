Mora appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiff Welco\nElectronics, Inc., and against defendant, on plaintiff’s claim for conversion, and against\ndefendant and in favor of plaintiff on defendant’s cross-complaint. Defendant contends\nthe trial court erred in denying his motion for nonsuit based on the ground of insufficient\nevidence to support the plaintiff’s cause of action for conversion.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we determine that defendant’s use of\nplaintiff’s credit card on defendant’s credit card terminal to transfer improperly specific\nsums of money to defendant’s bank account was a conversion as pleaded by plaintiff.\nWe affirm.\n\n\n                               FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n       In 1996 plaintiff employed Lidia Gimenes as a certified bookkeeper. Between\n1996 and February 2010, she was not plaintiff’s employee, but she made social visits at\nplaintiff’s place of business “all the time,” visiting Darrel Derouis, plaintiff’s then-\npresident, and other employees of plaintiff.\n       In February 2010, Derouis hired Gimenes to work for plaintiff because he wanted\nher assistance in “find[ing] where his money went.” A few weeks before Derouis hired\nGimenes, plaintiff no longer employed defendant Natalie Anderson,1 plaintiff’s\naccountant, because she “took off with no notice.”\n       Gimenes conducted an investigation and noticed that there was a discrepancy\nbetween the entries on plaintiff’s credit card statements and the amount of expenses. She\nexamined plaintiff’s credit card statements contained in plaintiff’s files located in\nAnderson’s office and determined that the entries on those statements did not match the\ntotal sum listed on the statements, thus suggesting that entries had somehow been deleted.\n\n\n\n\n1\n       Anderson is not a party to this appeal; her default was entered prior to trial.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       Gimenes reviewed plaintiff’s credit card statements she obtained from the credit\ncard company and determined that they contained numerous charges to “AQM,” a\nfictitious name used by defendant for a company he had established. Plaintiff’s credit\ncard statements located in Anderson’s office did not contain charges to AQM. Gimenes\nalso found plaintiff’s accounting “chart” for AQM, but, unlike the charts for all of\nplaintiff’s other vendors, no transactions were entered on it.\n       Based upon her review of the records, Gimenes determined that all of the AQM\ncharges made on plaintiff’s credit card account from 2009 to 2010, totaled $372,039.01,\nthe principal amount that plaintiff sought in this case against defendant. She said that\nbased on her investigation, she determined that plaintiff made the payments for the credit\ncard statements reflecting entries for AQM.\n       Gimenes said she discussed this matter with Derouis, and Derouis decided to hire\ncounsel and proceed with a lawsuit against defendant. In December 2010, Derouis died\nand Gimenes became plaintiff’s president.\n       Plaintiff retained William Torres, a certified public accountant practicing forensic\naccounting, to conduct an investigation of plaintiff’s accounting system because plaintiff\nwas “concerned [that] there were transactions . . . that were not properly recorded or\nimproprieties.” Torres was to “come in and determine and trace any potential\nimproprieties.” Upon conducting his investigation, Torres concluded that a vendor file\nfor AQM was set up, but it bore the address of another client and did not contain further\ndetails or transactions with respect to AQM. Torres did not find any invoices for AQM\nin plaintiff’s records and determined that the unrecorded AQM transactions caused an\nimbalance to plaintiff’s balance in the sum of $280,000. Torres found that there “clearly”\nappeared to be “a concealment” by not reporting properly the so-called AQM\ntransactions, and there was “some sort of manipulation done to not include these\ntransactions within the system.”\n       Defendant provided an explanation for the accounting discrepancies. In 2006,\ndefendant started a business called Nicholas Mora Property Management, a real property\nmanagement company, and he operated that business from plaintiff’s place of business.\n\n                                              3\n\fFrom 2006 to 2010 defendant also performed work for plaintiff as a quality assurance\nmanager,2 and other computer services for plaintiff. According to defendant, he was to\nbe compensated for his prior services when plaintiff’s quality assurance computer system\non which he worked was “certified” with a score of 100 percent.\n       Defendant said that in June 2008, the quality assurance computer system was\ncertified with a score of 99 percent, and Derouis agreed to compensate defendant for his\nprior services. According to defendant, Derouis was concerned about a garnishment of\ndefendant’s wages if plaintiff paid defendant by check; therefore, Anderson, plaintiff’s\naccountant at the time, whose responsibilities included payment of accounts payable,\nsuggested, and Derouis “ultimately” agreed, that defendant be paid like a vendor using\nplaintiff’s credit card account. Defendant said he and Derouis agreed that defendant\nwould be paid $100,000 for defendant’s work the prior year. Anderson set up in her\noffice a “swiping machine” credit card terminal. Defendant opened a bank account in his\nname and the name of Nicholas Mora Property Management, which did business under\nthe name of AQM Supplies. Defendant, as owner of Nicholas Mora Property\nManagement, dba AQM Supplies, leased a swiping machine credit card terminal.\n       Defendant said that from 2008 to January 2010, he submitted to plaintiff about 50\nor 60 invoices for the work he performed, and, although he “was not the one who\nprocessed” the charges to plaintiff’s credit card account, he collected money on the credit\ncard transactions. That money was paid through defendant’s credit card terminal and\nelectronically deposited into his bank account. From 2008 to 2009, while Anderson was\nworking full-time for plaintiff, defendant paid Anderson about $100,000.\n       Defendant stated that in 2010, he and Derouis had an argument; Derouis was\nangry, believing that defendant had “ripped him off” by over $300,000. Derouis asked\ndefendant to leave the premises, would not allow defendant to return to gather his\npossessions, and said that everything in defendant’s office belonged to plaintiff.\n\n\n2\n      Defendant testified that as a quality assurance manager, he dealt with a computer\nsystem concerning the manufacture of parts.\n\n                                             4\n\f                           PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In its complaint against defendant and Anderson, plaintiff asserted one cause of\naction—conversion of money. Plaintiff alleged that from January 1, 2008, to the time the\ncomplaint was filed on March 22, 2010, defendant and Anderson took from plaintiff,\nwithout plaintiff’s knowledge or consent, $376,142.70 in cash belonging to plaintiff, and\nconverted it for their own use. Plaintiff sought judgment against defendant and Anderson\nfor $376,142.70 as the value of the money he alleged was converted, as well as for\ninterest, expenses, punitive damages, and costs. Because Anderson failed to file an\nanswer to the complaint, her default was entered.\n       Defendant answered, and in a cross-complaint alleged that he and plaintiff entered\ninto a contract pursuant to which plaintiff agreed to use defendant’s services and share\nbuilding space, and plaintiff breached that contract “by maliciously remov[ing]\n[defendant] from his place of business without compensation for over thirty (30) days and\nwas informed by [plaintiff] that any and all of [defendant’s] business records and/or\nmaterials were now the property of [plaintiff].” Defendant alleged that plaintiff removed\nhim from his place of business “with the intent of acquiring [defendant’s] computer\nsoftware/hardware, quality management material, personal business records, and\nsensitive clientele information for [plaintiff’s] personal and business gain.” Plaintiff\nallegedly refused defendant’s requests to return the items to him.\n       During a bench trial, defendant made a motion for nonsuit on the grounds that\nplaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish a cause of action for conversion.\nThe trial court denied the motion. Following the bench trial, judgment was entered in\nfavor of plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of $446,447.81, and against\ndefendant and in favor of plaintiff on defendant’s cross-complaint. The parties did not\nrequest a statement of decision. Defendant timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n       A.     Motion for Nonsuit\n\n\n              1.     Standard of Review\n       “A motion for nonsuit allows a defendant to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s\nevidence before presenting his or her case. Because a successful nonsuit motion\nprecludes submission of plaintiff’s case to the jury, courts grant motions for nonsuit only\nunder very limited circumstances.” (Carson v. Facilities Development Co. (1984) 36\nCal.3d 830, 838.) “A defendant is entitled to a nonsuit if the trial court determines that,\nas a matter of law, the evidence presented by plaintiff is insufficient to permit a jury to\nfind in his favor. [Citation.]” (Nally v. Grace Community Church (1988) 47 Cal.3d 278,\n291.) “‘In reviewing the denial of a motion for nonsuit, appellate courts evaluate the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Reversal is [proper only] when no\nsubstantial evidence exists tending to prove each element of the plaintiff’s case.’ (Wright\nv. Beverly Fabrics, Inc. (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 346, 351 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 503].)” (Laico\nv. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 649, 659.) Defendant sought a nonsuit\nbased on the theory that plaintiff’s evidence did not support the pleaded cause of action\nfor conversion.\n\n\n              2.     General Principles\n       “‘Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another.\nThe elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to\npossession of the property; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or\ndisposition of property rights; and (3) damages. . . . [Citation.]’” (Los Angeles Federal\nCredit Union v. Madatyan (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1387; see CACI 2100; Gruber\nv. Pacific States Sav. & Loan Co. (1939) 13 Cal.2d 144, 148 [conversion is the wrongful\nexercise of dominion “over another’s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with\nhis rights therein”].) “‘Conversion is a strict liability tort. The foundation of the action\n\n                                              6\n\frests neither in the knowledge nor the intent of the defendant. Instead, the tort consists in\nthe breach of an absolute duty; the act of conversion itself is tortious. Therefore,\nquestions of the defendant’s good faith, lack of knowledge, and motive are ordinarily\nimmaterial. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] The basis of a conversion action ‘“rests upon the\nunwarranted interference by defendant with the dominion over the property of the\nplaintiff from which injury to the latter results. Therefore, neither good nor bad faith,\nneither care nor negligence, neither knowledge nor ignorance, are the gist of the action.”\n[Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Los Angeles Federal Credit Union v. Madatyan, supra, 209\nCal.App.4th at p. 1387; see PCO, Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil\n& Shapiro, LLP (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384, 395.) The unauthorized transfer of\nproperty constitutes a conversion. (See 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005)\nTorts, § 711(2), p. 1035 (Witkin).) Money may be the subject of conversion if the claim\ninvolves a specific, identifiable sum; it is not necessary that each coin or bill be\nearmarked. (Haigler v. Donnelly (1941) 18 Cal.2d 674, 681.)\n\n\n              3.     Analysis\n       Defendant contends that the transactions here—the use of a credit card to obtain\nmoney wrongfully from plaintiff—did not constitute the tort of conversion.\n\n\n                     a)      Credit Card Transaction as a Wrongful Taking of Property\n       The authorities have recognized the evolution of the common law tort of\nconversion. The California Supreme Court in Payne v. Elliot (1880) 54 Cal. 339\nobserved that at common law, trover was the remedy for conversion, which was limited\nto tangible personal property, “capable of being identified and taken into actual\npossession.” (Id. at p. 340.) The court said, “but the fiction on which the action of trover\nwas founded, namely, that a defendant had found the property of another, which was lost,\nhas become, in the progress of law, an unmeaning thing, which has been by most courts\ndiscarded; so that the action no longer exists as it did at common law, but has been\ndeveloped into a remedy for the conversion of every species of personal property.” (Id.\n\n                                              7\n\fat p. 341.) The court concluded that the defendant’s conversion of shares of stock, an\nintangible property interest (Ashton v. Heydenfeldt (1899) 124 Cal. 14, 16), without\nconverting the share certificates, constituted an actionable conversion. (Payne v. Elliot,\nsupra, 54 Cal. at pp. 341-342.)\n       Generally, conversion has been held to apply to the taking of intangible property\nrights when “represented by documents such as bonds, notes, bills of exchange, stock\ncertificates, and warehouse receipts.” (5 Witkin, supra, Torts, § 702, p. 1026.) As one\nauthority has written, “courts have permitted a recovery for conversion of assets reflected\nin such documents as accounts showing amounts owed, life insurance policies, and other\nevidentiary documents. These cases are far removed from the paradigm case of physical\nconversion; they are essentially financial or economic tort cases, not physical interference\ncases.” (3 Dobbs, The Law of Torts (2d ed. 2011) § 710, p. 804; see also Prosser,\nHandbook of the Law of Torts (2d ed. 1955) 69-70 [“It is now held that there may be an\naction for conversion, not only of the intangible rights represented by special instruments\nwhich give control, such as a check, a bill of lading, a bank book, an insurance policy, or\na stock certificate, but also of such rights alone, as in the case of the corporate stock apart\nfrom the certificate. There is perhaps no essential reason why there might not be a\nconversion of a debt, the good will of a business, or even an idea, or ‘any species of\npersonal property which is the subject of private ownership;’ but thus far there has been\nno particular need for any extension of the remedy beyond commercial securities”]; but\nsee Prosser and Keaton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) § 15, p. 92.)\n       As stated in the Restatement of Torts Second in comment f. section 242, “The\nprocess of extension [of the law of conversion] has not, however, necessarily terminated;\nand nothing that is said in this Section is intended to indicate that in a proper case liability\nfor intentional interference with some other kind of intangible rights may not be found.”\nThere is no reason why we should be “encumbered with the incrustations of ancient lore\nassociated with the tort of conversion.” (Harper, James and Gray on Torts (3d ed. rev.\n2006) § 2.13, p. 212 (Harper).)\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       In California, the tort of conversion has expanded well beyond its original\nboundaries. In holding that a misappropriation of a net operating loss without\ncompensation constitutes conversion, the court in Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont\nGeneral Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 124-125 (footnotes omitted) (Fremont) said,\n“We recognize that the common law of conversion, which developed initially as a\nremedy for the dispossession or other loss of chattel [citation], may be inappropriate for\nsome modern intangible personal property, the unauthorized use of which can take many\nforms. In some circumstances, newer economic torts have developed that may better take\ninto account the nature and uses of intangible property, the interests at stake, and the\nappropriate measure of damages. On the other hand, if the law of conversion can be\nadapted to particular types of intangible property and will not displace other, more\nsuitable law, it may be appropriate to do so. (Payne v. Elliot, supra, 54 Cal. at pp. 340-\n342.) The appropriate scope of a conversion action as applied to intangible personal\nproperty has been the subject of scholarly and informative discussion. (See, e.g., Harper\n[], supra, § 2.13, pp. 204-214; Comment, Analyzing the Urge to Merge: Conversion of\nIntangible Property and the Merger Doctrine in the Wake of Kremen v. Cohen (2005) 42\nHous. L.Rev. 489; 1 Dobbs, Law of Torts (2001) Direct and Intentional Interference with\nProperty, § 63, pp. 132-135; Comment, The Conversion of Intangible Property: Bursting\nthe Ancient Trover Bottle with New Wine (1991) 1991 BYU L.Rev. 1681; Prosser and\nKeeton, Torts, supra, Intentional Interference with Property,§ 15, pp. 90-92; see also\nKremen v. Cohen (9th Cir. 2003) 337 F.3d 1024, 1029-1036[3].)” The court in Fremont\nheld that the unauthorized taking of an intangible property interest not merged with or\n\n3\n       The Ninth Circuit in Kremen v. Cohen (9th Cir. 2003) 325 F.3d 1035 considered\nwhether the appropriation of an Internet domain name constituted a conversion and\nrequested a decision from the California Supreme Court on that issue. (Fremont, supra,\n148 Cal.App.4th at p. 125, fn. 10.) One judge in that case said, “California law, even\nnarrowly construed, recognizes conversion of property that shares all relevant features of\ndomain names.” (Kremen v. Cohen, supra, 325 F.3d at p. 1050 [dissent to certification].)\nThe California Supreme Court denied the request to decide the issue, and thereafter the\nNinth Circuit held that under California law an Internet domain name could be the subject\nof a conversion. (Kremen v. Cohen, supra, 337 F.3d at pp. 1030, 1036.)\n\n                                              9\n\freflected in tangible properly can be an actionable conversion. (Fremont, supra, 148\nCal.App.4th at pp. 119-125; see Kremen v. Cohen, supra, 337 F.3d at p. 1033 [California\ncourts “routinely apply the tort [of conversion] to intangibles without inquiring whether\nthey are merged in a document”].) In determining whether property that was taken is\nsubject to a conversion claim, courts have recognized that “[p]roperty is a broad concept\nthat includes ‘every intangible benefit and prerogative susceptible of possession or\ndisposition.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1030; see CTC Real Estate Services v. Lepe (2006)\n140 Cal.App.4th 856, 860 [one’s personal identifying information “is a valuable asset, the\nmisuse of which can have serious consequences to that person” and can be the object of\ntheft.]\n          In A&M Records, Inc. v. Heilman (1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 554, 570, the court said\nthat the unauthorized recording and sale of recorded musical performances constituted a\nmisappropriation of intangible property, which was a conversion. According to another\ncourt, the court in Heilman “implied conversion was a species of unfair competition.”\n(Lone Ranger Television, Inc. v. Program Radio Corp. (9th Cir. 1984) 740 F.2d 718,\n725.) Thus, the tort of conversion has been adapted to new property rights and modern\nmeans of commercial transactions.\n          Defendant wrongfully caused a charge to plaintiff’s credit card account by having\na specific sum of money paid through defendant’s credit card terminal into defendant’s\nbank account. Plaintiff had a property right in its credit card account because plaintiff’s\ninterest was specific, control over its credit card account, and an exclusive claim to the\nbalance. (See Kremen v. Cohen, supra, 337 F.3d at p. 1030.) Defendant obtained the\nmoney from the credit card company. As a result, plaintiff became indebted to the credit\ncard company. Thus, when defendant, or codefendant Anderson for defendant’s benefit,\nmisappropriated plaintiff’s credit card and used it, part of plaintiff’s credit balance with\nthe credit card company was taken by defendant and what resulted was an “unauthorized\ntransfer” to defendant of plaintiff’s property rights—i.e., in money from the available\ncredit line belonging to plaintiff with the credit card company. (5 Witkin, supra, Torts at\n§ 711(2), p. 1035 [unauthorized transfer as conversion].) That the taking was something\n\n                                              10\n\fthat affected plaintiff’s rights with a third party does not mean that there has not been a\nconversion of intangible property. As noted, there can be a conversion of intangible\nrights represented by special instruments such as a check bank book, insurance policy, or\nstock certificate (see Rest.2d Torts, § 242, comments a through e, pp. 473-475), all of\nwhich involve a taking by the defendant of the plaintiff’s property rights exercised\nthrough a third party.\n       In Acme Paper Co. v. Goffstein (1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 175, the defendant was\ngiven checks drawn by the plaintiff and then signed or had a third person sign the payee’s\nname, and took or shared the proceeds with that third person rather than delivering the\nchecks to the payee in accordance with the defendant’s representations upon being given\nthe checks. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant. Judgment was entered\nin favor of the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed. The court held that, “although\ntechnical words of conversion are not used, in stating the second cause of action there are\nassuredly facts alleging a conversion. There are allegations of fraud on the part of [the\ndefendant] in that he obtained certain checks of [the plaintiff] and exercised dominion\nover them in a manner not contemplated by [the plaintiff]. By either signing or having [a\nthird person] sign the [payee’s] name . . . thereto and sharing the proceeds with [the third\nperson], rather than delivering the checks to [the payee] in accordance with his\nrepresentation to [the plaintiff], [the defendant] clearly converted the checks.” (Id. at p.\n179.) The court observed that, “The subject matter of the conversion is the checks\nreceived by [the defendant] and applied to his own use or that of [the third person].” (Id.\nat p. 181.) As here, the actual money taken came from a third party—there the bank and\nhere the credit card company.\n       Credit card, debit card, or Paypal4 information may be the subject of a conversion.\nIn In re Easysaver Rewards Litig., supra, 737 F.Supp.2d 1159, the plaintiffs filed a class\n\n\n4\n        “PayPal provides an intermediary account for internet purchases. PayPal charges\nthe seller a fee for its service. The customers fund their PayPal accounts through\nelectronic transfers from their own financial institution (e.g., checking account, debit\ncard, or credit card). PayPal keeps the customers’ financial information confidential,\n\n                                             11\n\faction lawsuit against defendants Provide and EMI. The plaintiffs alleged that as a part\nof the “revenue generating efforts” of Provide, an operator of several internet businesses,\nit “‘routinely and fraudulently transmit[ed] its consumers’ credit card, debit card and/or\nPaypal information (“Private Payment Information”) to its third party marketing\npartners.’” (Id. at p. 1163.) The plaintiffs alleged that EMI was Provide’s marketing\npartner, and EMI “‘fraudulently charge[d] the cards or accounts without permission under\nthe guise that’ Provide’s customers have ‘supposedly joined a savings program known as\nEASYSAVER Rewards, which [EMI] manages on [Provide’s] behalf.’” (Id. at pp. 1163-\n1164.) The plaintiffs further alleged that “‘the EASYSAVER Rewards program . . .\n[was] nothing more than a sham.’” (Id. at p. 1163.) The plaintiffs in that case alleged,\ninter alia, that Provide wrongfully converted their Private Payment Information. (Id. at p.\n1179.) Provide filed a motion to dismiss, inter alia, the conversion claim alleged against\nit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. (Id. at pp. 1163, 1180.)\nThe federal district court denied the motion as to that claim, stating, “Plaintiffs define\n‘Private Payment Information’ as the consumers’ credit card, debit card and/or PayPal\naccount information. . . . Provide argues that . . . the intangible financial information . . .\n[does not] qualify as ‘property’ that can be converted. [¶] . . . Historically, the tort [of\nconversion] was limited to tangible property and did not apply to intangible property\n(with an exception for intangible property represented by documents, such as stock\ncertificates). [Citation.] Modern courts, however, have permitted conversion claims\nagainst intangible interests such as checks and customer lists. Acme Paper Co. v.\nGoffstein, [supra,] 125 Cal.App.2d [at p.] 179; Palm Springs-La Quinta Dev. Co. v.\nKieberk Corp., 46 Cal.App.2d 234, 115 P.2d 548 (1941) (conversion of index cards with\ninformation on potential customers, including their financial standing); see Thrifty-Tel,\nInc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal.App.4th 1559, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 468 (1996) (leaving open question\nwhether confidential codes to gain computer access could be converted because trespass\nto personal property claim existed); see generally Kremen v. Cohen, [supra,] 337 F.3d [at\n\nthereby providing a measure of security for online purchases. [Citation.]” (In re\nEasysaver Rewards Litig. (S.D.Cal. 2010) 737 F.Supp.2d 1159, 1163, fn. 1.)\n\n                                              12\n\fp.] 1030 (noting modern rejection of hard line between tangible and intangible property\nand holding plaintiff could state conversion claim as to internet domain name). [¶] . . .\n[¶] Although there is no clear authority, the Court concludes that [the] Plaintiffs may\nstate a conversion claim based upon the misappropriation of their Private Payment\nInformation, which was then used to make allegedly unauthorized debits from their\nfinancial accounts. Possession of the debit card or PayPal account information is similar\nto the intangible property interest in a check. Acme Paper, 125 Cal.App.2d at 179. [The\np]laintiffs assert the right to control the use of their Private Payment Information, which\ncan be used to withdraw funds from their bank accounts. See In Re Checking Account\nOverdraft Litig., 694 F.Supp.2d 1302, 1323 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (applying California law,\nholding that conversion action is available for wrongful debiting of funds from\ncustomer’s account because it interfered with [the] plaintiffs’ right to possess and use\nthose funds).” (Id. at pp. 1179-1180.)\n       Defendant, or Anderson on defendant’s behalf, had to take plaintiff’s credit card or\nits information in order to obtain the money from the credit card company, resulting in\ncharges showing up on the statement for which plaintiff was responsible to pay. Taking a\ncredit card or its information in order to obtain money is not materially different in effect\nthan conversions by taking other instruments such as checks, bonds, notes, bills of\nexchange, warehouse receipts, stock certificates, and information related to those\ninstruments, to obtain someone else’s money. Nor is the taking of a credit card or its\nnumber to obtain money that could otherwise be used by the owner materially differ from\nthe taking of private payment information or other property held to be capable of being\nconverted.\n       As the court in Fremont, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at page 125, in another context,\nsaid, “A net operating loss is a definite amount (see 26 U.S.C. § 172(c)) that can be\nrecorded in tax and accounting records. The significance of this, in our view, is not that\nthe intangible right is somehow merged or reflected in a document, but that both the\nproperty and the owner’s rights of possession and exclusive use are sufficiently definite\nand certain. The misappropriation of a net operating loss without compensation in the\n\n                                             13\n\fmanner alleged in the complaint, causing damage to Indemnity as alleged, is comparable\nto the misappropriation of tangible personal property or shares of stock for purposes\nrelevant here. We see no sound basis in reason to allow recovery in tort for one but not\nthe other.” A net operating loss that can be used by a taxpayer is analogous to a credit\ncard balance that can be used by the cardholder. In both instances, a party is deprived\nultimately of money. By, in effect, taking from plaintiff, or without authorization\ntransferring plaintiff’s rights in, a certain identifiable sum equivalent to money, defendant\nhas converted an intangible property right.\n       Cases holding that a conversion claim “fails because the simple failure to pay\nmoney owed does not constitute conversion” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)\n201 Cal.App.4th 267, 284), or because there was an overcharge (McKell v. Washington\nMutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1467) are not applicable here, because in\nthose cases, there was no taking of intangible property. Also inapplicable is Software\nDesign & Application, Ltd. v. Hoefer & Arnett, Inc. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 472 (Software\nDesign) [plaintiff sought to recover from brokerage firms money the wrongdoers\ndeposited and withdrew from the different firms] because it simply held that “[a] bailee\nwho receives bailed property from a thief, without notice of the true owner's claim and\nreturns the property to the bailor according to the terms of the bailment, is not liable for\nconversion.” (Id. at p. 485.)\n       Defendant cites Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120\n(Moore) to support his contention that the appropriation and unauthorized use of a credit\ncard and its information does not constitute conversion. In Moore, the plaintiff alleged\nthat the removal of his spleen and its use in potentially lucrative medical research,\nwithout his knowledge, was a conversion. (Id. at pp. 126, 134-135.) In affirming the trial\ncourt’s orders sustaining the defendants’ demurrers to the operative complaint, the court\nstated, “No court . . . has ever in a reported decision imposed conversion liability for the\nuse of human cells in medical research. While that fact does not end our inquiry, it raises\na flag of caution. . . . In effect, what [the plaintiff] is asking us to do is to impose a tort\nduty on scientists to investigate the consensual pedigree of each human cell sample used\n\n                                               14\n\fin research. To impose such a duty, which would affect medical research of importance\nto all of society, implicates policy concerns far removed from the traditional, two-party\nownership disputes in which the law of conversion arose.” (Id. at p. 135, footnotes\nomitted.) The court stated that it “should be hesitant to ‘impose [new tort duties] when to\ndo so would involve complex policy decisions’ [citation], especially when such decisions\nare more appropriately the subject of legislative deliberation and resolution.” (Id. at p.\n136.) Moore is not applicable here. That case concerned the alleged conversion of\nhuman cells by their use in medical research, which involved complex policy decisions, a\nfar cry from the misappropriation and unauthorized use of a credit card and its\ninformation, which does not involve any such complex policy decisions.\n       Without citing to legal authority, defendant contends that if the misappropriation\nof a credit card that occurred here constitutes a conversion, then any transaction involving\na credit card that leads to a dispute is subject to a cause of action for conversion.\nDefendant gives examples of what might be conversions under this hypothesis: persons\nusing a credit card to purchase or pay for goods, medical bills, or lawyer bills, and\ndisputes later arises regarding the quality of the goods, fault concerning the medical\ntreatment, or the appropriateness of the legal bills. This argument lacks merit. A\nperson’s willing use of a credit card to pay for goods or services has no relationship to\nwhat occurred here. Plaintiff did not consent to its credit card or its information being\nused by or on behalf of defendant. This case does not involve “the simple failure to pay\nmoney owed[, which] does not constitute conversion” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc.,\nsupra, 201 Cal.App.4th at p. 284), nor does it concern a simple overcharge, which also\ndoes not constitute a conversion (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc., supra, 142\nCal.App.4th at p. 1467).\n       Although the parties have not cited any authority that expressly covers the facts\nhere, our application of the tort of conversion in this case is consistent with existing legal\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fprinciples.5 As what was found to have occurred here was a theft, the tort of conversion\nwas an appropriate cause of action. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by denying\ndefendant’s motion for nonsuit. Plaintiff stated a cause of action for and presented\nsubstantial evidence in support of, conversion.\n\n\n                     b)     Specific Sum of Money Entrusted to Defendant\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for nonsuit,\narguing that there was insufficient evidence that a specific sum of money was entrusted to\ndefendant, and the taking of “various amounts of money over time” is not conversion.\n       As discussed ante, the intangible property converted was plaintiff’s credit card or\nits number and a portion of plaintiff’s credit card account, resulting in the taking from\nplaintiff, or unauthorized transfer of, a specific sum of money. Even if the conversion\nwere to be treated as a conversion of money, a conversion claim does not require that a\nspecific lump sum of money be entrusted to defendant; the plaintiff must merely prove a\nspecific, identifiable sum of money that was taken from it. “California cases permitting\nan action for conversion of money typically involve those who have misappropriated,\ncommingled, or misapplied specific funds held for the benefit of others. [Citations.]”\n(PCO, Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP, supra, 150\nCal.App.4th at pp. 396, italics added.) Cases have held that the amount of money\nconverted was readily ascertainable. (See, e.g., Los Angeles Federal Credit Union v.\nMadatyan, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th at p. 1388 [defendants, a car repair shop owner and its\nmanager are liable for conversion because plaintiff proved that defendants endorsed an\ninsurance check in the amount of $39,697.35 that was given to them by another, in which\n\n\n5\n       See Nelson, The Virtual Property Problem: What Property Rights in Virtual\nResources Might Look Like, How They Might Work, and Why They Are a Bad Idea\n(2010) 41 McGeorge L.Rev. 281, 299-3-2 [a “thief” of virtual property may be liable for\nconversion]; Haddock, et al., An Ordinary Economic Rationale for Extraordinary Legal\nSanctions (1990) 78 Cal. L.Rev. 1, 48 [“common theft can result in actions for both\ncriminal larceny and civil conversion”].\n\n\n                                             16\n\fproceeds plaintiff, a credit union, had an equitable interest]; Bazzanella v. Bell (1970) 10\nCal.App.3d 560 [the court affirmed the trial court’s ruling that defendant was liable for\nconversion of checks totaling $12,694.72, which had been assigned to plaintiff].)\n       A plaintiff must specifically identify the amount of money converted, not that a\nspecific, identifiable amount of money has been entrusted to the defendant. Here,\nplaintiff’s agents have misappropriated a specific sum of money from plaintiff. There is\nno requirement that the money have been held in trust—only that it be misappropriated.\nThe court in McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc., supra, 142 Cal.App.4th 1457 reversed\nan order of dismissal following the trial court’s order sustaining a demurrer to the\noperative complaint, stating, inter alia, without citation that “plaintiffs did not allege that\ndefendants were holding their payments on behalf of another, in essence in trust for the\nthird party vendors.” (Id. at p. 1492.) The court, however, prefaced that quoted language\nby stating that, “Money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless\nthere is a specific, identifiable sum involved, such as where an agent accepts a sum of\nmoney to be paid to another and fails to make the payment. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 1491;\nitalics added.) That is, a defendant’s acceptance of money to be paid to another is but\none example of a conversion claim.\n       Citing Software Design, supra, 49 Cal.App.4th 472, defendant states that a claim\nfor conversion is not stated when money is allegedly misappropriated “over time, in\nvarious sums, without any indication that it was held in trust for [plaintiff].” Defendant\ntakes that quote from Software Design out of context. In that case, McDonald was hired\nto manage the investments of the appellants, Software Design and Application, Ltd., a\nforeign corporation (SDA), and SDA’s sole owner. (Id. at p. 476.) McDonald and his\nsister opened brokerage accounts with banks, but instead of putting the accounts in the\nname of SDA, the foreign corporation, McDonald opened them in the name of a non-\nexistent limited partnership, called “Software Design & Application, Ltd.” (Id. at p. 476-\n478.) SDA’s owner transferred funds into the accounts, and over the course of two\nyears, McDonald systematically “sacked” the brokerage accounts. (Id. at p. 477.)\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       Although in Software Design, supra, 49 Cal.App.4th 472, the plaintiffs were not\ncustomers of the banks, the plaintiffs brought suit against them for, inter alia, conversion.\nIn affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the complaint on demurrer, the court stated that\nthe plaintiffs “cannot state a common law count for conversion of money. Conversion is\nany act of dominion wrongfully exerted over the personal property of another. [Citation.]\nHowever, money cannot be the subject of a conversion action unless a specific sum\ncapable of identification is involved. [Citation.] As to the banks there are no allegations\nthat as money in varying amounts was wired into the accounts, it was held in escrow or\nin some otherwise segregated fund for the benefit of [plaintiff] SDA. Rather, it came into\nthe partnership accounts over time, in various sums, without any indication that it was\nheld in trust for [plaintiff] SDA.” (Id. at p. 485; italics added.) That is, the defendant\nbanks were not liable to the plaintiffs because the accounts into which the defendants\ntransferred their money were in the name of a non-existent partnership, not plaintiff SDA.\nThe court noted that the wire transfers in that case were not “instruments” for purposes of\nCommercial Code section 3420, and therefore the plaintiffs could not maintain an action\nfor conversion based on that statute. (Ibid.) Here, plaintiff was, in effect, the owner of\nthe credit card that was misappropriated, as well as of the account that defendant\nimproperly charged.\n       Plaintiff proved a specific, identifiable sum of money that defendant had taken\nfrom it. Gimenes testified that the total sum of the improper charges made on plaintiff’s\ncredit card for defendant’s benefit was $372,039.01—the total principal amount plaintiff\nsought against defendant. The trial court properly awarded this principal amount to\nplaintiff and against defendant, together with prejudgment interest in the sum of\n$74,407.80.\n\n\n                             c)     Plaintiff’s Lack of Consent\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for nonsuit\ncontending that plaintiff’s failed to establish a cause of action for conversion of money\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fbecause there is not substantial evidence that plaintiff did not consent to the taking of the\nmoney. We disagree.\n       There is evidence that defendant and Derouis had an argument because Derouis\nwas angry, believing that defendant had “ripped him off” by over $300,000. Derouis\nasked defendant to leave the premises, would not allow defendant to return to gather his\npossessions, and said that everything in defendant’s office belonged to plaintiff. Gimenes\ntestified that Derouis hired her to work for plaintiff because Derouis was concerned and\nwanted Gimenes assistance in “find[ing] where his money went.” Gimenes testified that\nshe conducted an investigation, determined that defendant had taken $372,039.01 from\nplaintiff, and when she discussed the matter with Derouis, Derouis decided to hire\ncounsel and proceed with a lawsuit against defendant. There is substantial evidence that\nplaintiff did not consent to the taking of the money. (See McIntyre v. Sonoma Valley\nUnified School Dist. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 170, 179 [substantial evidence standard of\nreview is a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or\nuncontradicted, to support the findings below. We view the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and\nresolving all conflicts in its favor].)\n\n\n       B.      Admissible Evidence\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting certain exhibits because\nthey were not authenticated, in allowing Gimenes’s testimony because she lacked\npersonal knowledge, and without that evidence there is not substantial evidence in\nsupport of the judgment. The trial court did not err in admitting the evidence.\n\n\n               1.     Standard of Review\n       We review a trial court’s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. (People v.\nJablonski (2006) 37 Cal.4th 774, 805; People v. Harris (2005) 37 Cal.4th 310, 335;\nPeople v. Alvarez (1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 201.) “‘“[A] trial court’s ruling will not be\ndisturbed, and reversal . . . is not required, unless the trial court exercised its discretion in\n\n                                               19\n\fan arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage\nof justice.”’” (People v. Foster (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1301, 1328-1329.)\n       A writing must be authenticated before it may be received into evidence or before\nsecondary evidence of their contents may be received. (Evid. Code, § 1401.) Evidence\nCode Section 1400 provides, “Authentication of a writing means (a) the introduction of\nevidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the\nevidence claims it is or (b) the establishment of such facts by any other means provided\nby law.” Evidence Code Section 403, subdivision (a)(3) provides, “(a) The proponent of\nthe proffered evidence has the burden of producing evidence as to the existence of the\npreliminary fact, and the proffered evidence is inadmissible unless the court finds that\nthere is evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the preliminary fact,\nwhen: [¶] . . . [¶] The preliminary fact is the authenticity of a writing.”\n       Evidence Code section 702, subdivision (a), provides, “[T]he testimony of a\nwitness concerning a particular matter is inadmissible unless he has personal knowledge\nof the matter. Against the objection of a party, such personal knowledge must be shown\nbefore the witness may testify concerning the matter.”\n\n\n              2.     Background Facts\n       Plaintiff moved to introduce into evidence various exhibits to establish that\ndefendant converted plaintiff’s money by making unauthorized charges to plaintiff’s\ncredit card account and those charges were paid by plaintiff. Specifically, plaintiff\nmoved to introduce into evidence plaintiff’s credit card statements; checks from\nplaintiff’s checking account; and plaintiff’s checking account statements. Plaintiff\noffered into evidence an exhibit as circumstantial evidence that plaintiff’s payment of the\nstatement was authorized; it was otherwise offered for the limited purpose of plaintiff’s\n“notice that [it] was in [plaintiff’s] file; and when compared with the bank documents,\nthere were no AQM charges on that.” Plaintiff offered into evidence an exhibit for the\nlimited purpose of “showing [that] the additional bank records statements that are\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fcontained in [other exhibits] correspond with and can be traced to the actual full and\ncomplete copy of the bank statement.”\n       Defendant stipulated that Gimenes found a credit card statement in plaintiff’s files,\nand plaintiff paid the amount invoiced. Gimenes testified that she found one of the\nexhibits on the floor in defendant’s office after he had left plaintiff’s premises.\nDefendant testified that he was familiar with a statement exhibit because he looked\nthrough it about seven months before trial when the trial court ordered plaintiff to\nproduce it to defendant.\n       Gimenes testified that plaintiff issued checks to plaintiff’s credit card company,\nand they bore Derouis’s signature or his signature stamp. She testified that she received\nstatements from plaintiff’s credit card company in response to her request. Gimenes said\nthat she received bank statements from plaintiff’s bank in response to her request.\n       The trial court admitted into evidence the exhibits over defendant’s objections\nthat, inter alia, they were not authenticated. The trial court admitted into evidence some\nexhibits without objection by defendant.\n\n\n              3.     Analysis\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting exhibits into evidence\nbecause they were not authenticated. The challenged exhibits were authenticated\nproperly, or in some instances defendant forfeited his contention by not objecting to the\nintroduction of exhibits into evidence.\n       “A writing may be authenticated by evidence that: [¶] . . . [¶] (b) The writing\nhas been acted upon as authentic by the party against whom it is offered.” (Evid. Code, §\n1414, subd. (b); City of Vista v. Sutro & Co. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 401, 412-413.)\n“Evidence Code sections 1410 through 1421 list various methods of authentication of\ndocuments—e.g., by the testimony of a subscribing witness or a handwriting expert—but\nthese methods are not exclusive. [Citations.] ‘California courts have never considered\nthe list set forth in Evidence Code sections 1410-1421 as precluding reliance upon other\nmeans of authentication.’ [Citation.] ‘Circumstantial evidence, content and location are\n\n                                              21\n\fall valid means of authentication . . . .’ [Citation.]” (People v. Smith (2009) 179\nCal.App.4th 986, 1001.)\n       Gimenes testified that she found a statement in defendant’s office. It is reasonable\nto infer that because it was found in defendant’s office, that defendant acted upon it and it\nwas therefore authentic. (Evid. Code, § 1414, subd. (b).) In addition, the parties\nstipulated that Gimenes discovered a credit card statement in plaintiff’s files.\nCircumstantial evidence—the location and content of the statement—was sufficient to\nauthenticate it—whether it was located in defendant’s office or plaintiff’s files. (People\nv. Smith, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th at p. 1001.)\n       The trial court admitted into evidence certain exhibits without objection by\ndefendant. Defendant therefore forfeited his contention that the trial court erred in\nadmitting these exhibits into evidence. “Ordinarily, an appellate court will not consider a\nclaim of error if an objection could have been, but was not, made in the lower court.\n[Citation.] The reason for this rule is that ‘[i]t is both unfair and inefficient to permit a\nclaim of error on appeal that, if timely brought to the attention of the trial court, could\nhave been easily corrected or avoided.’ [Citations.] ‘[T]he forfeiture rule ensures that\nthe opposing party is given an opportunity to address the objection, and it prevents a\nparty from engaging in gamesmanship by choosing not to object, awaiting the outcome,\nand then claiming error.’ [Citation.]” (People v. French (2008) 43 Cal.4th 36, 46;\nPeople v. Lord (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1722 [defendant’s failure to request a\nhearing on the necessity of a support person’s presence, waived any objection to the\nfailure to hold a hearing].)\n        “A writing may be authenticated by evidence that the writing was received in\nresponse to a communication sent to the person who is claimed by the proponent of the\nevidence to be the author of the writing.” (Evid. Code, § 1420; People v. Roland (1969)\n270 Cal.App.2d 639, 646 [a teletype from the Department of Motor Vehicles was\nauthenticated by a witness who testified that he received it in response to his telephonic\nrequest for it].) Gimenes testified that she received statements from plaintiff’s credit card\ncompany in response to her request. They, therefore, were properly authenticated.\n\n                                              22\n\f       Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in allowing Gimenes’s testimony\nbecause she lacked personal knowledge. Gimenes is a certified bookkeeper and\nplaintiff’s president and was able to compare plaintiff’s accounting documents with its\ncredit card and bank account statements and records. Allowing her testimony was not\nerror. Moreover, defendant did not object to portions of Gimenes testimony.\n       In addition, defendant fails to establish what portions of Gimenes testimony to\nwhich he objected at trial and challenges on appeal. It is not our role to seek out support\nfor a defendant’s conclusory assertions, and such contentions may be rejected without\nconsideration. (People v. Stanley (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 793.) “Where any error is relied\non for a reversal it is not sufficient for appellant to point to the error and rest there.”\n(Santina v. General Petroleum Corp. (1940) 41 Cal.App.2d 74, 77.) “It is not our\nresponsibility to develop an appellant’s argument. [Citation.]” (Alvarez v. Jacmar Pacific\nPizza Corp. (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1206, fn. 11; Dills v. Redwoods Associates,\nLtd. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 888, 890, fn. 1) [“We will not develop the appellants’\narguments for them”].) “The reviewing court is not required to make an independent,\nunassisted study of the record in search of error or grounds to support the judgment. It is\nentitled to the assistance of counsel.” (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Appeal, §\n701, p. 769.) Defendant therefore failed to carry his burden of establishing that the trial\ncourt erred in allowing Gimenes’s testimony because she lacked personal knowledge.\n\n\n       C.      Cross-Complaint\n       Defendant contends that the judgment against defendant on his cross-complaint\nshould be reversed because it too was based on inadmissible evidence. Defendant alleged\nin his cross-complaint that he and plaintiff entered into a contract by which plaintiff\nagreed to use defendant’s services and share building space, and plaintiff breached that\ncontract by improperly removing defendant from his place of business without\ncompensation and was informed by plaintiff that any and all of defendant’s business\nrecords and materials was the property of plaintiff.\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f       Defendant however does not develop his contention that the judgment against\ndefendant on his cross-complaint was based on inadmissible evidence, or provide\ncitations to the record or otherwise cite to authority that would support it. The failure to\ncite authority or develop an argument with reference to any specific alleged deficiencies\nin the record constitutes a forfeiture of the issue on appeal. (Magic Kitchen LLC v. Good\nThings Internat. Ltd. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1161-1162; Moulton Niguel Water\nDist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived when a\nparty fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority”]; Badie v.\nBank of America (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 784-785 [“When an appellant fails to raise a\npoint, or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to\nauthority, we treat the point as waived”]; People v. Stanley, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 793 [It\nis not the role of a reviewing court to independently seek out support for appellant’s\nconclusory assertions, and such contentions may be rejected without consideration];\nAlvarez v. Jacmar Pacific Pizza Corp., supra, 100 App.4th at p. 1206, fn. 11 [“It is not\nour responsibility to develop an appellant’s argument”]; Paterno v. State of California\n(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 68, 106 [“An appellate court is not required to examine\nundeveloped claims, nor to make arguments for parties”].) We therefore do not consider\ndefendant’s contention.\n\n\n       D.     Damages\n       Defendant contends that despite Gimenes testimony that the credit charges\nconstituting defendant’s conversion of funds reflected in a statement totaling $108,\n336.10, the statement actually totals $95,817.20, and it would be “unfair” to charge\ndefendant with that error. Defendant, however, never objected during trial that there was\nan erroneous calculation of the claimed damages. Defendant also did not cross-examine\nGimenes regarding her calculations, nor did he introduce evidence that Gimenes’s\ncalculations were incorrect. Defendant, therefore, forfeited his contention.

Mora, B240626\n\n\nKRIEGLER, J., Concurring.\n\n\n       I concur in the result, but not the reasoning, of the majority opinion. The appellate\nrecord conclusively demonstrates that defendant Nicholas J. Mora misappropriated\n$372,039 from plaintiff Welco Electronics, Inc. The trial court characterized Mora’s\nversion of events as “absolutely nonsense,” “difficult to listen to,” and “absolutely\nludicrous.” But the ultimate conclusion articulated by the court was not that there was a\nconversion of the balance of a credit card account; instead, the court quite accurately\ndescribed Mora’s conduct as a “theft,” finding that Mora “stole the money,” and he\nconspired with codefendant Natalie Anderson “in committing theft and committed a theft\nin the amount of $372,039.01.” I would affirm the judgment on the basis of the trial\ncourt’s finding of theft.\n       This case was tried on the straightforward theory that Mora committed a series of\nthefts, in differing amounts and at various times, from Welco. Although labeled a cause\nof action for conversion, Welco alleged in part that Mora and Anderson “took the\nproperty described above from plaintiff’s possession without its consent or knowledge\n. . . .” It was alleged that Welco “was, and still is, the owner, and was and is, entitled to\npossession of the following personal property, namely, cash in the sum of $376,142.70.”\nIn closing argument, Welco’s counsel stated: “The long and short of it is the money was\nconverted. He is responsible for the conversion of the money. He received the money,\nand it’s a strict liability tort.” In other words, Welco’s theory had nothing to do with\nconversion of the balance of its credit card.\n       We are required to liberally construe Welco’s complaint to affect substantial\njustice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) Regardless of the label attached to a pleading, “‘[a]\nparty is entitled to any and all relief which may be appropriate under the scope of his\npleadings and within the facts alleged and proved, irrespective of the theory upon which\n\fthe facts were pleaded, [or] the title of the pleading . . . .’” (Cooper v. State Farm Mutual\nAutomobile Ins. Co. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 876, 904, quoting Potrero Homes v. Western\nOrbis Co. (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 450, 456.) “We have the power, as a reviewing court, to\ndisregard the ‘mislabeling’ of causes of action, where supported by the record. (Thrifty-\nTel, Inc. v. Bezenek (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1559, 1566 . . . .)” (Hernandez v. Lopez\n(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 932, 938 (Hernandez).)\n       My colleagues go to great lengths to conclude Mora’s conduct constituted a\nconversion based on the theory—not alleged in the complaint or asserted on appeal until\nprompted by a letter from the court—that a conversion occurred because Mora took\nWelco’s right to a balance in its credit card. I see no need to engage in that analysis.\n“Suffice it to say, defendants may not appropriate” Welco’s property by engaging in 50-\n60 unauthorized credit card transactions “without having to answer legally . . . .”\n(Hernandez, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at p. 940.) The record establishes that Mora stole\nmoney using Welco’s credit card account, and his conduct “amounted to the\nembezzlement thereof.” (Vujacich v. Southern Commercial Co. (1913) 21 Cal.App. 439,\n442.) I would affirm the judgment on this basis—Welco effectively alleged and proved,\nand the trial court found, that Mora committed theft of $372,039.\n       Treating Welco’s claim as one of theft of money avoids the further problem\ncreated by the majority’s analysis of the requirement that conversion of money requires\nthe identification of a sum certain. California law has recognized liability for conversion\nof money in limited circumstances: there must be a sum certain and the holder of the\nmoney must do so in trust, for the benefit or another, or for his principal’s account.\n(Haigler v. Donnelly (1941) 18 Cal.2d 674, 681.) “A cause of action for conversion of\nmoney can be stated only where a defendant interferes with the plaintiff’s possessory\ninterest in a specific, identifiable sum, such as when a trustee or agent misappropriates\nthe money entrusted to him.” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th\n267, 284-285.)\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       It has been held that where a defendant comes into possession of “various sums”\nof money, “without any indication that it was held in trust” for the plaintiff, there is no\ncause of action for conversion. (Software Design & Application, Ltd. v. Hoefer & Arnett,\nInc. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 472, 485.) The rule was stated in McKell v. Washington\nMutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457 as prohibiting a cause of action for conversion\nof money where “plaintiffs did not allege that defendants were holding their payments on\nbehalf of another, in essence in trust for the third party vendors.” (Id. at p. 1491.)\n       Mora did not receive a fixed sum of money in an agency, fiduciary, or trust\nrelationship with Welco. Mora took a variety of sums, over a period of time, by use of\nmultiple larcenous transactions. I would affirm the judgment on that basis.\n\n\n\n\n              KRIEGLER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f",

Mora appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiff Welco\nElectronics, Inc., and against defendant, on plaintiff’s claim for conversion, and against\ndefendant and in favor of plaintiff on defendant’s cross-complaint. Defendant contends\nthe trial court erred in denying his motion for nonsuit based on the ground of insufficient\nevidence to support the plaintiff’s cause of action for conversion.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we determine that defendant’s use of\nplaintiff’s credit card on defendant’s credit card terminal to transfer improperly specific\nsums of money to defendant’s bank account was a conversion as pleaded by plaintiff.\nWe affirm.\n\n\n                               FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n       In 1996 plaintiff employed Lidia Gimenes as a certified bookkeeper. Between\n1996 and February 2010, she was not plaintiff’s employee, but she made social visits at\nplaintiff’s place of business “all the time,” visiting Darrel Derouis, plaintiff’s then-\npresident, and other employees of plaintiff.\n       In February 2010, Derouis hired Gimenes to work for plaintiff because he wanted\nher assistance in “find[ing] where his money went.” A few weeks before Derouis hired\nGimenes, plaintiff no longer employed defendant Natalie Anderson,1 plaintiff’s\naccountant, because she “took off with no notice.”\n       Gimenes conducted an investigation and noticed that there was a discrepancy\nbetween the entries on plaintiff’s credit card statements and the amount of expenses. She\nexamined plaintiff’s credit card statements contained in plaintiff’s files located in\nAnderson’s office and determined that the entries on those statements did not match the\ntotal sum listed on the statements, thus suggesting that entries had somehow been deleted.\n\n\n\n\n1\n       Anderson is not a party to this appeal; her default was entered prior to trial.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       Gimenes reviewed plaintiff’s credit card statements she obtained from the credit\ncard company and determined that they contained numerous charges to “AQM,” a\nfictitious name used by defendant for a company he had established. Plaintiff’s credit\ncard statements located in Anderson’s office did not contain charges to AQM. Gimenes\nalso found plaintiff’s accounting “chart” for AQM, but, unlike the charts for all of\nplaintiff’s other vendors, no transactions were entered on it.\n       Based upon her review of the records, Gimenes determined that all of the AQM\ncharges made on plaintiff’s credit card account from 2009 to 2010, totaled $372,039.01,\nthe principal amount that plaintiff sought in this case against defendant. She said that\nbased on her investigation, she determined that plaintiff made the payments for the credit\ncard statements reflecting entries for AQM.\n       Gimenes said she discussed this matter with Derouis, and Derouis decided to hire\ncounsel and proceed with a lawsuit against defendant. In December 2010, Derouis died\nand Gimenes became plaintiff’s president.\n       Plaintiff retained William Torres, a certified public accountant practicing forensic\naccounting, to conduct an investigation of plaintiff’s accounting system because plaintiff\nwas “concerned [that] there were transactions . . . that were not properly recorded or\nimproprieties.” Torres was to “come in and determine and trace any potential\nimproprieties.” Upon conducting his investigation, Torres concluded that a vendor file\nfor AQM was set up, but it bore the address of another client and did not contain further\ndetails or transactions with respect to AQM. Torres did not find any invoices for AQM\nin plaintiff’s records and determined that the unrecorded AQM transactions caused an\nimbalance to plaintiff’s balance in the sum of $280,000. Torres found that there “clearly”\nappeared to be “a concealment” by not reporting properly the so-called AQM\ntransactions, and there was “some sort of manipulation done to not include these\ntransactions within the system.”\n       Defendant provided an explanation for the accounting discrepancies. In 2006,\ndefendant started a business called Nicholas Mora Property Management, a real property\nmanagement company, and he operated that business from plaintiff’s place of business.\n\n                                              3\n\fFrom 2006 to 2010 defendant also performed work for plaintiff as a quality assurance\nmanager,2 and other computer services for plaintiff. According to defendant, he was to\nbe compensated for his prior services when plaintiff’s quality assurance computer system\non which he worked was “certified” with a score of 100 percent.\n       Defendant said that in June 2008, the quality assurance computer system was\ncertified with a score of 99 percent, and Derouis agreed to compensate defendant for his\nprior services. According to defendant, Derouis was concerned about a garnishment of\ndefendant’s wages if plaintiff paid defendant by check; therefore, Anderson, plaintiff’s\naccountant at the time, whose responsibilities included payment of accounts payable,\nsuggested, and Derouis “ultimately” agreed, that defendant be paid like a vendor using\nplaintiff’s credit card account. Defendant said he and Derouis agreed that defendant\nwould be paid $100,000 for defendant’s work the prior year. Anderson set up in her\noffice a “swiping machine” credit card terminal. Defendant opened a bank account in his\nname and the name of Nicholas Mora Property Management, which did business under\nthe name of AQM Supplies. Defendant, as owner of Nicholas Mora Property\nManagement, dba AQM Supplies, leased a swiping machine credit card terminal.\n       Defendant said that from 2008 to January 2010, he submitted to plaintiff about 50\nor 60 invoices for the work he performed, and, although he “was not the one who\nprocessed” the charges to plaintiff’s credit card account, he collected money on the credit\ncard transactions. That money was paid through defendant’s credit card terminal and\nelectronically deposited into his bank account. From 2008 to 2009, while Anderson was\nworking full-time for plaintiff, defendant paid Anderson about $100,000.\n       Defendant stated that in 2010, he and Derouis had an argument; Derouis was\nangry, believing that defendant had “ripped him off” by over $300,000. Derouis asked\ndefendant to leave the premises, would not allow defendant to return to gather his\npossessions, and said that everything in defendant’s office belonged to plaintiff.\n\n\n2\n      Defendant testified that as a quality assurance manager, he dealt with a computer\nsystem concerning the manufacture of parts.\n\n                                             4\n\f                           PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In its complaint against defendant and Anderson, plaintiff asserted one cause of\naction—conversion of money. Plaintiff alleged that from January 1, 2008, to the time the\ncomplaint was filed on March 22, 2010, defendant and Anderson took from plaintiff,\nwithout plaintiff’s knowledge or consent, $376,142.70 in cash belonging to plaintiff, and\nconverted it for their own use. Plaintiff sought judgment against defendant and Anderson\nfor $376,142.70 as the value of the money he alleged was converted, as well as for\ninterest, expenses, punitive damages, and costs. Because Anderson failed to file an\nanswer to the complaint, her default was entered.\n       Defendant answered, and in a cross-complaint alleged that he and plaintiff entered\ninto a contract pursuant to which plaintiff agreed to use defendant’s services and share\nbuilding space, and plaintiff breached that contract “by maliciously remov[ing]\n[defendant] from his place of business without compensation for over thirty (30) days and\nwas informed by [plaintiff] that any and all of [defendant’s] business records and/or\nmaterials were now the property of [plaintiff].” Defendant alleged that plaintiff removed\nhim from his place of business “with the intent of acquiring [defendant’s] computer\nsoftware/hardware, quality management material, personal business records, and\nsensitive clientele information for [plaintiff’s] personal and business gain.” Plaintiff\nallegedly refused defendant’s requests to return the items to him.\n       During a bench trial, defendant made a motion for nonsuit on the grounds that\nplaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish a cause of action for conversion.\nThe trial court denied the motion. Following the bench trial, judgment was entered in\nfavor of plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of $446,447.81, and against\ndefendant and in favor of plaintiff on defendant’s cross-complaint. The parties did not\nrequest a statement of decision. Defendant timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n       A.

Standard of Review\n       “A motion for nonsuit allows a defendant to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s\nevidence before presenting his or her case.

Elliot,\nsupra, 54 Cal. at pp. 341-342.)\n       Generally, conversion has been held to apply to the taking of intangible property\nrights when “represented by documents such as bonds, notes, bills of exchange, stock\ncertificates, and warehouse receipts.” (5 Witkin, supra, Torts, § 702, p. 1026.) As one\nauthority has written, “courts have permitted a recovery for conversion of assets reflected\nin such documents as accounts showing amounts owed, life insurance policies, and other\nevidentiary documents. These cases are far removed from the paradigm case of physical\nconversion; they are essentially financial or economic tort cases, not physical interference\ncases.” (3 Dobbs, The Law of Torts (2d ed. 2011) § 710, p. 804; see also Prosser,\nHandbook of the Law of Torts (2d ed. 1955) 69-70 [“It is now held that there may be an\naction for conversion, not only of the intangible rights represented by special instruments\nwhich give control, such as a check, a bill of lading, a bank book, an insurance policy, or\na stock certificate, but also of such rights alone, as in the case of the corporate stock apart\nfrom the certificate. There is perhaps no essential reason why there might not be a\nconversion of a debt, the good will of a business, or even an idea, or ‘any species of\npersonal property which is the subject of private ownership;’ but thus far there has been\nno particular need for any extension of the remedy beyond commercial securities”]; but\nsee Prosser and Keaton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) § 15, p. 92.)\n       As stated in the Restatement of Torts Second in comment f. section 242, “The\nprocess of extension [of the law of conversion] has not, however, necessarily terminated;\nand nothing that is said in this Section is intended to indicate that in a proper case liability\nfor intentional interference with some other kind of intangible rights may not be found.”\nThere is no reason why we should be “encumbered with the incrustations of ancient lore\nassociated with the tort of conversion.” (Harper, James and Gray on Torts (3d ed. rev.\n2006) § 2.13, p. 212 (Harper).)\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       In California, the tort of conversion has expanded well beyond its original\nboundaries.

On the other hand, if the law of conversion can be\nadapted to particular types of intangible property and will not displace other, more\nsuitable law, it may be appropriate to do so. (Payne v. Elliot, supra, 54 Cal. at pp. 340-\n342.) The appropriate scope of a conversion action as applied to intangible personal\nproperty has been the subject of scholarly and informative discussion.

Plaintiff had a property right in its credit card account because plaintiff’s\ninterest was specific, control over its credit card account, and an exclusive claim to the\nbalance. (See Kremen v. Cohen, supra, 337 F.3d at p. 1030.) Defendant obtained the\nmoney from the credit card company. As a result, plaintiff became indebted to the credit\ncard company. Thus, when defendant, or codefendant Anderson for defendant’s benefit,\nmisappropriated plaintiff’s credit card and used it, part of plaintiff’s credit balance with\nthe credit card company was taken by defendant and what resulted was an “unauthorized\ntransfer” to defendant of plaintiff’s property rights—i.e., in money from the available\ncredit line belonging to plaintiff with the credit card company.

The court held that, “although\ntechnical words of conversion are not used, in stating the second cause of action there are\nassuredly facts alleging a conversion. There are allegations of fraud on the part of [the\ndefendant] in that he obtained certain checks of [the plaintiff] and exercised dominion\nover them in a manner not contemplated by [the plaintiff].

Taking a\ncredit card or its information in order to obtain money is not materially different in effect\nthan conversions by taking other instruments such as checks, bonds, notes, bills of\nexchange, warehouse receipts, stock certificates, and information related to those\ninstruments, to obtain someone else’s money. Nor is the taking of a credit card or its\nnumber to obtain money that could otherwise be used by the owner materially differ from\nthe taking of private payment information or other property held to be capable of being\nconverted.\n       As the court in Fremont, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at page 125, in another context,\nsaid, “A net operating loss is a definite amount (see 26 U.S.C. § 172(c)) that can be\nrecorded in tax and accounting records. The significance of this, in our view, is not that\nthe intangible right is somehow merged or reflected in a document, but that both the\nproperty and the owner’s rights of possession and exclusive use are sufficiently definite\nand certain.

We see no sound basis in reason to allow recovery in tort for one but not\nthe other.” A net operating loss that can be used by a taxpayer is analogous to a credit\ncard balance that can be used by the cardholder.

In Moore, the plaintiff alleged\nthat the removal of his spleen and its use in potentially lucrative medical research,\nwithout his knowledge, was a conversion. (Id. at pp. 126, 134-135.) In affirming the trial\ncourt’s orders sustaining the defendants’ demurrers to the operative complaint, the court\nstated, “No court . . . has ever in a reported decision imposed conversion liability for the\nuse of human cells in medical research. While that fact does not end our inquiry, it raises\na flag of caution. . . . In effect, what [the plaintiff] is asking us to do is to impose a tort\nduty on scientists to investigate the consensual pedigree of each human cell sample used\n\n                                               14\n\fin research. To impose such a duty, which would affect medical research of importance\nto all of society, implicates policy concerns far removed from the traditional, two-party\nownership disputes in which the law of conversion arose.” (Id. at p. 135, footnotes\nomitted.) The court stated that it “should be hesitant to ‘impose [new tort duties] when to\ndo so would involve complex policy decisions’ [citation], especially when such decisions\nare more appropriately the subject of legislative deliberation and resolution.” (Id. at p.\n136.) Moore is not applicable here. That case concerned the alleged conversion of\nhuman cells by their use in medical research, which involved complex policy decisions, a\nfar cry from the misappropriation and unauthorized use of a credit card and its\ninformation, which does not involve any such complex policy decisions.\n       Without citing to legal authority, defendant contends that if the misappropriation\nof a credit card that occurred here constitutes a conversion, then any transaction involving\na credit card that leads to a dispute is subject to a cause of action for conversion.\nDefendant gives examples of what might be conversions under this hypothesis: persons\nusing a credit card to purchase or pay for goods, medical bills, or lawyer bills, and\ndisputes later arises regarding the quality of the goods, fault concerning the medical\ntreatment, or the appropriateness of the legal bills. This argument lacks merit. A\nperson’s willing use of a credit card to pay for goods or services has no relationship to\nwhat occurred here. Plaintiff did not consent to its credit card or its information being\nused by or on behalf of defendant. This case does not involve “the simple failure to pay\nmoney owed[, which] does not constitute conversion” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc.,\nsupra, 201 Cal.App.4th at p. 284), nor does it concern a simple overcharge, which also\ndoes not constitute a conversion (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc., supra, 142\nCal.App.4th at p. 1467).\n       Although the parties have not cited any authority that expressly covers the facts\nhere, our application of the tort of conversion in this case is consistent with existing legal\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fprinciples.5 As what was found to have occurred here was a theft, the tort of conversion\nwas an appropriate cause of action. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by denying\ndefendant’s motion for nonsuit. Plaintiff stated a cause of action for and presented\nsubstantial evidence in support of, conversion.\n\n\n                     b)     Specific Sum of Money Entrusted to Defendant\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for nonsuit,\narguing that there was insufficient evidence that a specific sum of money was entrusted to\ndefendant, and the taking of “various amounts of money over time” is not conversion.\n       As discussed ante, the intangible property converted was plaintiff’s credit card or\nits number and a portion of plaintiff’s credit card account, resulting in the taking from\nplaintiff, or unauthorized transfer of, a specific sum of money. Even if the conversion\nwere to be treated as a conversion of money, a conversion claim does not require that a\nspecific lump sum of money be entrusted to defendant; the plaintiff must merely prove a\nspecific, identifiable sum of money that was taken from it. “California cases permitting\nan action for conversion of money typically involve those who have misappropriated,\ncommingled, or misapplied specific funds held for the benefit of others.

The court, however, prefaced that quoted language\nby stating that, “Money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless\nthere is a specific, identifiable sum involved, such as where an agent accepts a sum of\nmoney to be paid to another and fails to make the payment.

In that case, McDonald was hired\nto manage the investments of the appellants, Software Design and Application, Ltd., a\nforeign corporation (SDA), and SDA’s sole owner. (Id. at p. 476.) McDonald and his\nsister opened brokerage accounts with banks, but instead of putting the accounts in the\nname of SDA, the foreign corporation, McDonald opened them in the name of a non-\nexistent limited partnership, called “Software Design & Application, Ltd.” (Id. at p. 476-\n478.) SDA’s owner transferred funds into the accounts, and over the course of two\nyears, McDonald systematically “sacked” the brokerage accounts. (Id. at p. 477.)\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       Although in Software Design, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254382\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254382/software-design-application-v-hoefer-arnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Conversion is\nany act of dominion wrongfully exerted over the personal property of another. [Citation.]\nHowever, money cannot be the subject of a conversion action unless a specific sum\ncapable of identification is involved. [Citation.] As to the banks there are no allegations\nthat as money in varying amounts was wired into the accounts, it was held in escrow or\nin some otherwise segregated fund for the benefit of [plaintiff] SDA. Rather, it came into\nthe partnership accounts over time, in various sums, without any indication that it was\nheld in trust for [plaintiff] SDA.” (Id. at p. 485; italics added.) That is, the defendant\nbanks were not liable to the plaintiffs because the accounts into which the defendants\ntransferred their money were in the name of a non-existent partnership, not plaintiff SDA.\nThe court noted that the wire transfers in that case were not “instruments” for purposes of\nCommercial Code section 3420, and therefore the plaintiffs could not maintain an action\nfor conversion based on that statute. (Ibid.) Here, plaintiff was, in effect, the owner of\nthe credit card that was misappropriated, as well as of the account that defendant\nimproperly charged.\n       Plaintiff proved a specific, identifiable sum of money that defendant had taken\nfrom it. Gimenes testified that the total sum of the improper charges made on plaintiff’s\ncredit card for defendant’s benefit was $372,039.01—the total principal amount plaintiff\nsought against defendant. The trial court properly awarded this principal amount to\nplaintiff and against defendant, together with prejudgment interest in the sum of\n$74,407.80.\n\n\n                             c)     Plaintiff’s Lack of Consent\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for nonsuit\ncontending that plaintiff’s failed to establish a cause of action for conversion of money\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fbecause there is not substantial evidence that plaintiff did not consent to the taking of the\nmoney. We disagree.\n       There is evidence that defendant and Derouis had an argument because Derouis\nwas angry, believing that defendant had “ripped him off” by over $300,000. Derouis\nasked defendant to leave the premises, would not allow defendant to return to gather his\npossessions, and said that everything in defendant’s office belonged to plaintiff. Gimenes\ntestified that Derouis hired her to work for plaintiff because Derouis was concerned and\nwanted Gimenes assistance in “find[ing] where his money went.” Gimenes testified that\nshe conducted an investigation, determined that defendant had taken $372,039.01 from\nplaintiff, and when she discussed the matter with Derouis, Derouis decided to hire\ncounsel and proceed with a lawsuit against defendant. There is substantial evidence that\nplaintiff did not consent to the taking of the money. (See McIntyre v. Sonoma Valley\nUnified School Dist.

Background Facts\n       Plaintiff moved to introduce into evidence various exhibits to establish that\ndefendant converted plaintiff’s money by making unauthorized charges to plaintiff’s\ncredit card account and those charges were paid by plaintiff. Specifically, plaintiff\nmoved to introduce into evidence plaintiff’s credit card statements; checks from\nplaintiff’s checking account; and plaintiff’s checking account statements. Plaintiff\noffered into evidence an exhibit as circumstantial evidence that plaintiff’s payment of the\nstatement was authorized; it was otherwise offered for the limited purpose of plaintiff’s\n“notice that [it] was in [plaintiff’s] file; and when compared with the bank documents,\nthere were no AQM charges on that.” Plaintiff offered into evidence an exhibit for the\nlimited purpose of “showing [that] the additional bank records statements that are\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fcontained in [other exhibits] correspond with and can be traced to the actual full and\ncomplete copy of the bank statement.”\n       Defendant stipulated that Gimenes found a credit card statement in plaintiff’s files,\nand plaintiff paid the amount invoiced. Gimenes testified that she found one of the\nexhibits on the floor in defendant’s office after he had left plaintiff’s premises.\nDefendant testified that he was familiar with a statement exhibit because he looked\nthrough it about seven months before trial when the trial court ordered plaintiff to\nproduce it to defendant.\n       Gimenes testified that plaintiff issued checks to plaintiff’s credit card company,\nand they bore Derouis’s signature or his signature stamp. She testified that she received\nstatements from plaintiff’s credit card company in response to her request. Gimenes said\nthat she received bank statements from plaintiff’s bank in response to her request.\n       The trial court admitted into evidence the exhibits over defendant’s objections\nthat, inter alia, they were not authenticated.

Analysis\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting exhibits into evidence\nbecause they were not authenticated.

In addition, the parties\nstipulated that Gimenes discovered a credit card statement in plaintiff’s files.\nCircumstantial evidence—the location and content of the statement—was sufficient to\nauthenticate it—whether it was located in defendant’s office or plaintiff’s files. (People\nv. Smith, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th at p. 1001.)\n       The trial court admitted into evidence certain exhibits without objection by\ndefendant.

The appellate\nrecord conclusively demonstrates that defendant Nicholas J. Mora misappropriated\n$372,039 from plaintiff Welco Electronics, Inc. The trial court characterized Mora’s\nversion of events as “absolutely nonsense,” “difficult to listen to,” and “absolutely\nludicrous.” But the ultimate conclusion articulated by the court was not that there was a\nconversion of the balance of a credit card account; instead, the court quite accurately\ndescribed Mora’s conduct as a “theft,” finding that Mora “stole the money,” and he\nconspired with codefendant Natalie Anderson “in committing theft and committed a theft\nin the amount of $372,039.01.” I would affirm the judgment on the basis of the trial\ncourt’s finding of theft.\n       This case was tried on the straightforward theory that Mora committed a series of\nthefts, in differing amounts and at various times, from Welco. Although labeled a cause\nof action for conversion, Welco alleged in part that Mora and Anderson “took the\nproperty described above from plaintiff’s possession without its consent or knowledge\n. . . .” It was alleged that Welco “was, and still is, the owner, and was and is, entitled to\npossession of the following personal property, namely, cash in the sum of $376,142.70.”\nIn closing argument, Welco’s counsel stated: “The long and short of it is the money was\nconverted. He is responsible for the conversion of the money. He received the money,\nand it’s a strict liability tort.” In other words, Welco’s theory had nothing to do with\nconversion of the balance of its credit card.\n       We are required to liberally construe Welco’s complaint to affect substantial\njustice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) Regardless of the label attached to a pleading, “‘[a]\nparty is entitled to any and all relief which may be appropriate under the scope of his\npleadings and within the facts alleged and proved, irrespective of the theory upon which\n\fthe facts were pleaded, [or] the title of the pleading . . . .’” (Cooper v.

(1913) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3282977\"><a href=\"/opinion/3284548/vujacich-v-southern-commercial-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

I would affirm the judgment on this basis—Welco effectively alleged and proved,\nand the trial court found, that Mora committed theft of $372,039.\n       Treating Welco’s claim as one of theft of money avoids the further problem\ncreated by the majority’s analysis of the requirement that conversion of money requires\nthe identification of a sum certain. California law has recognized liability for conversion\nof money in limited circumstances: there must be a sum certain and the holder of the\nmoney must do so in trust, for the benefit or another, or for his principal’s account.\n(Haigler v. Donnelly (1941) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189375\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189375/haigler-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681.) “A cause of action for conversion of\nmoney can be stated only where a defendant interferes with the plaintiff’s possessory\ninterest in a specific, identifiable sum, such as when a trustee or agent misappropriates\nthe money entrusted to him.” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">267</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284-285.)\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       It has been held that where a defendant comes into possession of “various sums”\nof money, “without any indication that it was held in trust” for the plaintiff, there is no\ncause of action for conversion. (Software Design & Application, Ltd. v. Hoefer & Arnett,\nInc. (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254382\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254382/software-design-application-v-hoefer-arnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Mora took a variety of sums, over a period of time, by use of\nmultiple larcenous transactions. I would affirm the judgment on that basis.\n\n\n\n\n              KRIEGLER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f</pre>",
