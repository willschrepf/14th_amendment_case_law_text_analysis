When\nNDCS rebuffed Keup’s efforts, Keup sued various NDCS officials under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 for violating his First Amendment rights. The district court directed a verdict\nin Keup’s favor against F.X. Hopkins and Dennis Bakewell, awarded Keup nominal\ndamages, and ordered Hopkins and Bakewell to pay approximately $25,000 in\n\fattorney fees and costs. Hopkins and Bakewell appeal. We affirm in part and reverse\nin part.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n       A.    Parties\n       Keup is a prisoner in the custody of NDCS at the Lincoln Correctional Center\n(LCC). At all relevant times, Hopkins was one of NDCS’s directors. Bakewell was\nLCC’s warden. Salvador Cruz, Ty DeKoenig,1 and Diane Sabatka-Rine were lower-\nlevel NDCS employees at LCC.\n\n      B.     Keup’s Grievances\n      While incarcerated, Keup challenged various restrictions upon his ability to\nsend and receive mail. Keup availed himself of NDCS’s three-level grievance\nprocedure. To exhaust administrative remedies, a prisoner must file (1) an informal\ngrievance, (2) a step-one grievance, and (3) a step-two grievance. 68 Neb. Admin.\nCode, ch. 2 § 004. See also 42 U.S.C. § 1997e; Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 83-4,111 &\n83-4,135-139.\n\n       Time limits apply at each level of the NDCS grievance process. A complaining\ninmate must file an informal grievance within three days of the “incident of concern.”\nIf the inmate is dissatisfied with NDCS’s response, the inmate must file a step-one\ngrievance within fifteen days. If the inmate remains dissatisfied, the inmate must file\na step-two grievance within ten days of NDCS’s response to the step-one grievance.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n     The spelling of DeKoenig’s name is unclear. We adopt the spelling in Keup’s\namended complaint.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      Four incidents are relevant to this appeal:\n\n             1.     March 2005—Attempt to Mail Drawings to Mother\n       In March 2005, Keup tried to send his mother two drawings, one of a cross\ncontaining a small marijuana leaf and the other a bare-breasted woman. At the time,\n§ 207.1.1 of LCC’s Operational Memorandum (OM) forbade inmates from\nmanufacturing, possessing, or distributing drawings of “[u]ncovered female breasts,”\n“illegal drugs,” and any other “obscene, nude, lewd, lascivious, . . . or filthy” material.\nLCC personnel accordingly refused to let Keup mail the drawings.\n\n       Keup timely grieved NDCS’s refusal, alleging a violation of his free speech\nrights. Keup reasoned “it seems illogical that I can receive explicit porn magazines\n[and] books containing images of drugs but I can’t use my artistic abilities to create\ncertain drawings for a good cause!” Cruz denied Keup’s informal grievance,\nBakewell denied Keup’s step-one grievance, and Hopkins denied Keup’s step-two\ngrievance.\n\n            2.     September 2005—Attempt to Mail Photocopies to the Maoists\n      In September 2005, Keup tried to send photocopies of his drawings of the\nmarijuana leaf and the bare-breasted woman to the Maoists. Apparently, Keup was\nasking the Maoists for legal help.2 DeKoenig intercepted the photocopies.\n\n       Keup immediately grieved DeKoenig’s seizure of the photocopies, asserting a\nviolation of his right to send legal mail. On September 16, 2005, Cruz denied Keup’s\ninformal grievance. On November 3, 2005, Keup filed a step-one grievance,\nreasserting his right to “unrestricted/uncensored access for the conduction of legal\naffairs.” On December 22, 2005, Bakewell denied the step-one grievance as untimely.\n\n      2\n       According to its now-defunct website, the Maoists were a “collection of\nexisting or emerging Maoist internationalist parties” dedicated to “uphold[ing] the\nrevolutionary communist ideology of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.”\n\n                                           -3-\n\fOn July 6, 2006, Keup filed a step-two grievance, in which he repeated the claims in\nhis step-one and informal grievances. Keup alleged he was unable to file his step-one\ngrievance in a timely manner because LCC personnel segregated him from the general\nprison population on September 24, 2005. On August 10, 2006, Hopkins denied\nKeup’s step-two grievance as untimely and pointed out segregated prisoners have\nunfettered access to NDCS’s grievance procedure.\n\n               3.    December 2006—Attempt to Receive Pastor Sukraw’s Card\n       In late December 2006, Pastor Joe Sukraw, a religious cleric from North Platte,\nNebraska, purchased a religious book and a greeting card for Keup. The bookstore\nsent Keup the book and the card in a single mailing, and LCC personnel intercepted\nthe shipment. Section 205.1.1 of the OM provided that “[a]ll publications . . . must\nbe prepaid and sent to the inmate directly from the publisher” but “cards . . . can not\nbe included in mailings from the bookstore/publisher.” LCC personnel returned the\ncard to the sender, stapled a return notice to the book, and delivered the book to Keup.\n\n       Keup timely grieved the return of the card, claiming LCC personnel violated\nthe OM. Keup complained the stapling of the return notice to the book was “highly\ndisrespectful,” “degrading,” and “equivical [sic] to leaving shoe prints all over ones\n[sic] mail before delivery.” Keup asked for a new book, because the first fourteen\npages of his book had staple holes in them. Cruz denied Keup’s informal grievance,\nSabatka-Rine denied Keup’s step-one grievance, and Hopkins denied Keup’s step-two\ngrievance.\n\n             4.     February 2007—Attempt to Receive a Bondage Sketchbook\n       In February 2007, LCC personnel intercepted a bondage sketchbook in Keup’s\nmail, because the OM forbade prisoners from possessing depictions of violent sexual\nacts. Keup timely grieved the interception of the bondage sketchbook, opining that\n“bondage is a sexual fetish and is not of a violent nature or an illegal nature” and\nquerying “how an art book containing various sketches of nude women could pose a\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthreat?” Cruz denied Keup’s informal grievance, Sabatka-Rine denied Keup’s step-\none grievance, and Hopkins denied Keup’s step-two grievance.\n\n      C.     Prior Proceedings\n             1.    Complaint\n       In August 2005, Keup filed a complaint against Hopkins, Bakewell, and Cruz\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Keup claimed Hopkins, Bakewell, and Cruz violated Keup’s\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they prohibited Keup from sending his\ndrawings of marijuana and the bare-breasted woman to his mother. Keup requested\ncompensatory and punitive damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n      In May 2006, Hopkins, Bakewell, and Cruz answered the complaint. They\ndenied the complaint’s substance and asserted Keup’s request for an “injunction is\nmoot since changes have been made in the [OM] that allow the Plaintiff to do what\nhe seeks the injunction to do.” In September 2005, NDCS amended the OM to ban\nonly drawings that “advocate or are likely to incite violent or illegal activity.”\n\n              2.     Amended Complaint\n       In August 2007, Keup amended his complaint with leave of court. In addition\nto the claims in the complaint, Keup lodged additional First and Fourteenth\nAmendment claims under § 1983 against Hopkins, Bakewell, DeKoenig, Cruz, and\nSabatka-Rine for their respective roles in blocking the mailing of the photocopies to\nthe Maoists; seizing the greeting card and the bondage sketchbook; and allegedly\nretaliating against Keup for filing the complaint (collectively, the new claims). Keup\nagain requested monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief.\n\n      In August and September 2007, Hopkins, Bakewell, DeKoenig, Cruz, and\nSabatka-Rine answered the amended complaint. These defendants variously denied\nthe substance of the amended complaint, asserted Keup’s claims were moot to the\nextent Keup was asking for permission to send his drawings to his mother and the\n\n                                         -5-\n\fMaoists, and maintained Keup failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his\nnew claims.\n\n               3.    Motion for Summary Judgment\n        In November 2007, Hopkins, Bakewell, DeKoenig, Cruz, and Sabatka-Rine\nmoved for summary judgment, asserting their exhaustion and mootness defenses. In\nFebruary 2008, the district court rejected the defendants’ exhaustion defenses because,\nin its view, dismissal of Keup’s new claims would result in another lawsuit and foster\njudicial inefficiency. The district court rejected the defendants’ mootness defenses as\nto Keup’s request for monetary damages, but held Keup’s requests for prospective\ninjunctive and declaratory relief were moot because NDCS had amended the OM.\n\n              4.    Jury Trial\n       In July 2008, the district court held a jury trial on Keup’s requests for damages.\nAt the conclusion of Keup’s case-in-chief, the district court directed a verdict in favor\nof Keup and against Hopkins and Bakewell for “prohibit[ing] the plaintiff from\nmailing his drawings . . . to his mother and the [Maoists].” The district court awarded\nKeup $1.00 in nominal damages and invited an application for attorney fees. All of\nKeup’s remaining claims failed when the district court directed a verdict in the\ndefendants’ favor as to some claims and the jury rejected all others.\n\n             5.     Attorney Fees\n       In August 2008, Keup applied for over $30,000 in attorney fees and costs,\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). Hopkins and Bakewell\nobjected on two alternative grounds: (1) Keup was not entitled to any attorney fees\nbecause he was not a “prevailing party” for purposes of § 1988(b), and (2) the cap on\nattorney fees at § 1997e(d)(2) limited the amount of attorney fees to 150% of the\nmonetary damages award, that is, $1.50. The district court overruled these objections.\nThe court declined to reduce Keup’s attorney fees award for his lack of success at trial\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fand awarded Keup approximately $25,000 in attorney fees and costs.3 Hopkins and\nBakewell appealed.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n      Hopkins and Bakewell argue the district court erred in (1) rejecting their\nmootness defenses, (2) rejecting their exhaustion defenses, and (3) awarding attorney\nfees. We consider each assignment of error, in turn.\n\n      A.      Mootness\n      Hopkins and Bakewell contend the district court erred in holding Keup’s\nsurviving claims—his requests for monetary damages to remedy NDCS’s refusal to\nmail his drawings to his mother and the Maoists—were not moot. Keup counters\nHopkins and Bakewell waived any right to appellate review of this issue. Keup points\nout that, although Hopkins and Bakewell pressed their mootness defenses in their\nsummary judgment motion, they failed to reassert their mootness defenses at trial.\nHopkins and Bakewell do not respond to Keup’s waiver argument.\n\n       Ordinarily we “will not review a district court’s denial of a motion for summary\njudgment after a trial on the merits.” EEOC v. Sw. Bell Tel., L.P., 550 F.3d 704, 708\n(8th Cir. 2008) (citing Eaddy v. Yancey, 317 F.3d 914, 916 (8th Cir. 2003)). As a\ngeneral rule, a litigant must renew summary judgment arguments in Rule 50 motions\nfor judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiff’s case-in-chief and again\nafter the jury’s verdict. See Eaddy, 317 F.3d at 916. After scouring the trial\ntranscript, it appears Hopkins and Bakewell did not raise their mootness defenses at\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The district court reduced the hourly rates of Keup’s attorneys to $150 per\nhour, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(3), because Keup’s attorneys sought payment\nat a rate in excess of 150% of the hourly rate established for court-appointed counsel.\n\n                                         -7-\n\f      A narrow exception to the general rule, however, applies in this case.\n“Questions of mootness are matters of subject matter jurisdiction[.]” Charleston\nHousing Auth. v. USDA, 419 F.3d 729, 739 (8th Cir. 2005). A defendant may\nchallenge our subject matter jurisdiction at any time. See Borntrager v. Cent. States\nSe. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund, 577 F.3d 913, 919 (8th Cir. 2009).\n\n       In our de novo review of the district court’s ruling on the mootness issue, see\nCharleston, 419 F.3d at 739, we hold Keup’s surviving claims are not moot. NDCS’s\ndecision to amend the OM in September 2005 mooted any need for prospective\ninjunctive or declaratory relief, but the amendment did not deprive Keup of the\nopportunity to seek monetary damages for prior violations of his constitutional rights.\nSee, e.g., Watts v. Brewer, 588 F.2d 646, 648 (8th Cir. 1978) (holding the plaintiff’s\nrelease from prison “mooted his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief but [did]\nnot moot[] his claim for monetary damages”); see also Lowry ex rel. Crow v. Watson\nChapel Sch. Dist., 540 F.3d 752, 761 n.8 (8th Cir. 2008) (discussing the voluntary\ncessation exception to the mootness doctrine), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1526 (2009).\n\n        B.     Exhaustion\n        Hopkins and Bakewell maintain Keup failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies with respect to his request for monetary damages to remedy NDCS’s refusal\nto mail his drawings to the Maoists. Hopkins and Bakewell interpret § 1997e to\nrequire plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to all claims\nasserted in a lawsuit before filing the lawsuit. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (“No action\nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [§] 1983 . . . by a prisoner\nconfined in any . . . prison . . . until such administrative remedies as are available are\nexhausted.”). They point out Keup did not exhaust his administrative remedies (if he\ndid so at all) until after he filed the complaint. Indeed, the incidents of concern giving\nrise to the new claims did not occur until after Keup filed his complaint. Hopkins and\nBakewell aver the district court should not have permitted Keup to amend his\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fcomplaint to bootstrap the new claims into this lawsuit. Instead, Hopkins and\nBakewell insist Keup should have filed a second lawsuit.\n\n       Keup rejoins Hopkins and Bakewell waived any right to appellate review of this\nissue, because Hopkins and Bakewell did not press their exhaustion defenses at trial.\nAgain, Hopkins and Bakewell do not respond to Keup’s waiver argument.\n\n        After reviewing the trial transcript, it appears Hopkins and Bakewell failed to\nraise their exhaustion defenses at trial. Unlike the issue of mootness, which is\njurisdictional, “reliance on [§ 1997e(a)’s] exhaustion requirement can be waived.”\nFoulk v. Charrier, 262 F.3d 687, 697 (8th Cir. 2001) (citing Randolph v. Rogers, 253\nF.3d 342, 347 n.11 (8th Cir. 2001)). By failing to reassert their exhaustion defenses\nat trial, Hopkins and Bakewell waived them. See Eaddy, 317 F.3d at 916 (“Even a\ncursory review of precedent in this Circuit reveals that we do not review a denial of\na summary-judgment motion after a full trial on the merits.”).\n\n      C.      Attorney Fees\n              1.     Keup is a Prevailing Party\n        Because the district court directed a verdict in Keup’s favor as to some of his\n§ 1983 claims, he is a “prevailing party” entitled to attorney fees under § 1988.\nHopkins and Bakewell argue a voluntary change in a defendant’s behavior—such as\nNDCS’s decision to amend the OM—standing alone does not qualify a plaintiff as a\n“prevailing party.” See Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of\nHealth & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001). Keup, however, won a finding of\nliability and an award of nominal damages from the district court. The district court’s\nrulings created a sufficient “court-ordered ‘chang[e] [in] the legal relationship\nbetween the’” parties to support an attorney fees award under § 1988. Id. at 604\n(citation omitted); see, e.g., Ollis v. HearthStone Homes, Inc., 495 F.3d 570, 576 (8th\nCir. 2007) (affirming the district court’s holding that a plaintiff was a prevailing party\neven though he only received nominal damages because “[r]egardless of the amount\n\n                                           -9-\n\fof [the] judgment, [the plaintiff] was the prevailing party and, thus, is entitled to an\naward of attorney fees”) (citing Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 112 (1992) (“[A]\nplaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party under § 1988.”)).\n\n       2.     Section 1997e(d)(2) Cap Applies\n       The district court awarded Keup approximately $25,000 in attorney fees even\nthough the court determined Keup was entitled to only $1.00 in nominal damages.\nThe district court’s ruling is contrary to governing precedent. Section 1997e(d)(2)\nprovides, “If the award of attorney’s fees is not greater than 150 percent of the\njudgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.” We have repeatedly construed\nthis “awkwardly worded” statute to cap awards of attorney fees in prisoner rights\ncases to 150% of the monetary damages awarded. When the plaintiff only receives\nnominal damages of $1.00, § 1997e(d)(2) caps attorney fees at $1.50. See, e.g., Royal\nv. Kautzky, 375 F.3d 720, 725-26 (8th Cir. 2004) (referring to the statute as\n“awkwardly worded” and affirming an attorney fees award of $1.50); Foulk, 262 F.3d\nat 704 (similar); see also Pearson v. Welborn, 471 F.3d 732, 742-44 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(holding cap at § 1997e(d)(2) applied to a prisoner who was entitled to nominal\ndamages); Robbins v. Chronister, 435 F.3d 1238, 1239 (10th Cir. 2006) (en banc)\n(similar); Walker v. Bain, 257 F.3d 660, 667 (6th Cir. 2001) (similar); Boivin v.\nBlack, 225 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2000) (similar).\n\n        Keup acknowledges this precedent but argues the cap should not apply because\nhe obtained non-monetary relief. See Foulk, 262 F.3d at 703 n.17 (“However, if\nnon-monetary relief is ordered (whether with or without a monetary award), the\nattorney’s fees cap . . . does not apply.”) (citations omitted); see also Dannenberg v.\nValadez, 338 F.3d 1070, 1073-75 (9th Cir. 2003) (acknowledging exception); Walker,\n257 F.3d at 667 n.2 (same); Boivin, 225 F.3d at 41 n.4 (same). The problem for Keup\nis that he did not obtain non-monetary relief. The district court’s passing statement\nin its order awarding attorney fees that it “grant[ed Keup] the declaratory and\ninjunctive relief he sought” lacks support in the record. The district court’s other\n\n                                         -10-\n\forders and the terms of its formal judgments make clear the court did not award Keup\nnon-monetary relief, instead dismissing all claims for declaratory or injunctive relief.\nEven if the district court’s orders somehow could be construed as awarding Keup a\ndeclaratory judgment, we hold such a declaratory judgment would be insufficient to\navoid the cap in § 1997e(d)(2). See, e.g., Pearson, 471 F.3d at 743 (holding that,\nwhere a request for equitable relief was mooted, any declaratory judgment would not\nconstitute “other relief” distinct from nominal damages to dodge the cap) (citing\nRhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 4 (1988) (per curiam) (stating a declaratory judgment\n“will constitute relief, for purposes of § 1988, if, and only if, it affects the behavior\nof the defendant toward the plaintiff”)). Because any declaratory judgment inferred\nfrom the district court’s orders and judgments here would not affect the behavior of\nHopkins and Bakewell toward Keup, Keup is entitled to no more than $1.50 in\nattorney fees. See id.\n\n             3.      Lack of Success\n      Hopkins and Bakewell argue the district court abused its discretion in\ncalculating the amount of Keup’s attorney fees award. For example, Hopkins and\nBakewell point out the district court failed to reduce Keup’s attorney fees for his lack\nof success at trial and his failure to win his complaints about the greeting card and\nbondage sketchbook incidents. See, e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 440\n(1983) (“We hold that the extent of a plaintiff’s success is a crucial factor in\ndetermining the proper amount of . . . attorney’s fees[.]”). Because § 1997e(d)(2) caps\nKeup’s attorney fees award at a scant $1.50, we need not reach this argument.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n      We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for reduction of the attorney fees\naward to $1.50.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f",

When\nNDCS rebuffed Keup’s efforts, Keup sued various NDCS officials under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 for violating his First Amendment rights. The district court directed a verdict\nin Keup’s favor against F.X. Hopkins and Dennis Bakewell, awarded Keup nominal\ndamages, and ordered Hopkins and Bakewell to pay approximately $25,000 in\n\fattorney fees and costs. Hopkins and Bakewell appeal. We affirm in part and reverse\nin part.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n       A.    Parties\n       Keup is a prisoner in the custody of NDCS at the Lincoln Correctional Center\n(LCC). At all relevant times, Hopkins was one of NDCS’s directors. Bakewell was\nLCC’s warden. Salvador Cruz, Ty DeKoenig,1 and Diane Sabatka-Rine were lower-\nlevel NDCS employees at LCC.\n\n      B.     Keup’s Grievances\n      While incarcerated, Keup challenged various restrictions upon his ability to\nsend and receive mail. Keup availed himself of NDCS’s three-level grievance\nprocedure. To exhaust administrative remedies, a prisoner must file (1) an informal\ngrievance, (2) a step-one grievance, and (3) a step-two grievance. 68 Neb. Admin.\nCode, ch. 2 § 004. See also 42 U.S.C. § 1997e; Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 83-4,111 &\n83-4,135-139.\n\n       Time limits apply at each level of the NDCS grievance process. A complaining\ninmate must file an informal grievance within three days of the “incident of concern.”\nIf the inmate is dissatisfied with NDCS’s response, the inmate must file a step-one\ngrievance within fifteen days. If the inmate remains dissatisfied, the inmate must file\na step-two grievance within ten days of NDCS’s response to the step-one grievance.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n     The spelling of DeKoenig’s name is unclear. We adopt the spelling in Keup’s\namended complaint.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      Four incidents are relevant to this appeal:\n\n             1.     March 2005—Attempt to Mail Drawings to Mother\n       In March 2005, Keup tried to send his mother two drawings, one of a cross\ncontaining a small marijuana leaf and the other a bare-breasted woman. At the time,\n§ 207.1.1 of LCC’s Operational Memorandum (OM) forbade inmates from\nmanufacturing, possessing, or distributing drawings of “[u]ncovered female breasts,”\n“illegal drugs,” and any other “obscene, nude, lewd, lascivious, . . . or filthy” material.\nLCC personnel accordingly refused to let Keup mail the drawings.\n\n       Keup timely grieved NDCS’s refusal, alleging a violation of his free speech\nrights. Keup reasoned “it seems illogical that I can receive explicit porn magazines\n[and] books containing images of drugs but I can’t use my artistic abilities to create\ncertain drawings for a good cause!” Cruz denied Keup’s informal grievance,\nBakewell denied Keup’s step-one grievance, and Hopkins denied Keup’s step-two\ngrievance.\n\n            2.     September 2005—Attempt to Mail Photocopies to the Maoists\n      In September 2005, Keup tried to send photocopies of his drawings of the\nmarijuana leaf and the bare-breasted woman to the Maoists. Apparently, Keup was\nasking the Maoists for legal help.2 DeKoenig intercepted the photocopies.\n\n       Keup immediately grieved DeKoenig’s seizure of the photocopies, asserting a\nviolation of his right to send legal mail. On September 16, 2005, Cruz denied Keup’s\ninformal grievance. On November 3, 2005, Keup filed a step-one grievance,\nreasserting his right to “unrestricted/uncensored access for the conduction of legal\naffairs.” On December 22, 2005, Bakewell denied the step-one grievance as untimely.\n\n      2\n       According to its now-defunct website, the Maoists were a “collection of\nexisting or emerging Maoist internationalist parties” dedicated to “uphold[ing] the\nrevolutionary communist ideology of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.”\n\n                                           -3-\n\fOn July 6, 2006, Keup filed a step-two grievance, in which he repeated the claims in\nhis step-one and informal grievances. Keup alleged he was unable to file his step-one\ngrievance in a timely manner because LCC personnel segregated him from the general\nprison population on September 24, 2005. On August 10, 2006, Hopkins denied\nKeup’s step-two grievance as untimely and pointed out segregated prisoners have\nunfettered access to NDCS’s grievance procedure.\n\n               3.    December 2006—Attempt to Receive Pastor Sukraw’s Card\n       In late December 2006, Pastor Joe Sukraw, a religious cleric from North Platte,\nNebraska, purchased a religious book and a greeting card for Keup. The bookstore\nsent Keup the book and the card in a single mailing, and LCC personnel intercepted\nthe shipment. Section 205.1.1 of the OM provided that “[a]ll publications . . . must\nbe prepaid and sent to the inmate directly from the publisher” but “cards . . . can not\nbe included in mailings from the bookstore/publisher.” LCC personnel returned the\ncard to the sender, stapled a return notice to the book, and delivered the book to Keup.\n\n       Keup timely grieved the return of the card, claiming LCC personnel violated\nthe OM. Keup complained the stapling of the return notice to the book was “highly\ndisrespectful,” “degrading,” and “equivical [sic] to leaving shoe prints all over ones\n[sic] mail before delivery.” Keup asked for a new book, because the first fourteen\npages of his book had staple holes in them. Cruz denied Keup’s informal grievance,\nSabatka-Rine denied Keup’s step-one grievance, and Hopkins denied Keup’s step-two\ngrievance.\n\n             4.     February 2007—Attempt to Receive a Bondage Sketchbook\n       In February 2007, LCC personnel intercepted a bondage sketchbook in Keup’s\nmail, because the OM forbade prisoners from possessing depictions of violent sexual\nacts. Keup timely grieved the interception of the bondage sketchbook, opining that\n“bondage is a sexual fetish and is not of a violent nature or an illegal nature” and\nquerying “how an art book containing various sketches of nude women could pose a\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthreat?” Cruz denied Keup’s informal grievance, Sabatka-Rine denied Keup’s step-\none grievance, and Hopkins denied Keup’s step-two grievance.\n\n      C.     Prior Proceedings\n             1.    Complaint\n       In August 2005, Keup filed a complaint against Hopkins, Bakewell, and Cruz\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Keup claimed Hopkins, Bakewell, and Cruz violated Keup’s\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they prohibited Keup from sending his\ndrawings of marijuana and the bare-breasted woman to his mother. Keup requested\ncompensatory and punitive damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n      In May 2006, Hopkins, Bakewell, and Cruz answered the complaint. They\ndenied the complaint’s substance and asserted Keup’s request for an “injunction is\nmoot since changes have been made in the [OM] that allow the Plaintiff to do what\nhe seeks the injunction to do.” In September 2005, NDCS amended the OM to ban\nonly drawings that “advocate or are likely to incite violent or illegal activity.”\n\n              2.     Amended Complaint\n       In August 2007, Keup amended his complaint with leave of court. In addition\nto the claims in the complaint, Keup lodged additional First and Fourteenth\nAmendment claims under § 1983 against Hopkins, Bakewell, DeKoenig, Cruz, and\nSabatka-Rine for their respective roles in blocking the mailing of the photocopies to\nthe Maoists; seizing the greeting card and the bondage sketchbook; and allegedly\nretaliating against Keup for filing the complaint (collectively, the new claims). Keup\nagain requested monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief.\n\n      In August and September 2007, Hopkins, Bakewell, DeKoenig, Cruz, and\nSabatka-Rine answered the amended complaint. These defendants variously denied\nthe substance of the amended complaint, asserted Keup’s claims were moot to the\nextent Keup was asking for permission to send his drawings to his mother and the\n\n                                         -5-\n\fMaoists, and maintained Keup failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his\nnew claims.\n\n               3.    Motion for Summary Judgment\n        In November 2007, Hopkins, Bakewell, DeKoenig, Cruz, and Sabatka-Rine\nmoved for summary judgment, asserting their exhaustion and mootness defenses. In\nFebruary 2008, the district court rejected the defendants’ exhaustion defenses because,\nin its view, dismissal of Keup’s new claims would result in another lawsuit and foster\njudicial inefficiency. The district court rejected the defendants’ mootness defenses as\nto Keup’s request for monetary damages, but held Keup’s requests for prospective\ninjunctive and declaratory relief were moot because NDCS had amended the OM.\n\n              4.    Jury Trial\n       In July 2008, the district court held a jury trial on Keup’s requests for damages.\nAt the conclusion of Keup’s case-in-chief, the district court directed a verdict in favor\nof Keup and against Hopkins and Bakewell for “prohibit[ing] the plaintiff from\nmailing his drawings . . . to his mother and the [Maoists].” The district court awarded\nKeup $1.00 in nominal damages and invited an application for attorney fees. All of\nKeup’s remaining claims failed when the district court directed a verdict in the\ndefendants’ favor as to some claims and the jury rejected all others.\n\n             5.     Attorney Fees\n       In August 2008, Keup applied for over $30,000 in attorney fees and costs,\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). Hopkins and Bakewell\nobjected on two alternative grounds: (1) Keup was not entitled to any attorney fees\nbecause he was not a “prevailing party” for purposes of § 1988(b), and (2) the cap on\nattorney fees at § 1997e(d)(2) limited the amount of attorney fees to 150% of the\nmonetary damages award, that is, $1.50. The district court overruled these objections.\nThe court declined to reduce Keup’s attorney fees award for his lack of success at trial\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fand awarded Keup approximately $25,000 in attorney fees and costs.3 Hopkins and\nBakewell appealed.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n      Hopkins and Bakewell argue the district court erred in (1) rejecting their\nmootness defenses, (2) rejecting their exhaustion defenses, and (3) awarding attorney\nfees. We consider each assignment of error, in turn.\n\n      A.      Mootness\n      Hopkins and Bakewell contend the district court erred in holding Keup’s\nsurviving claims—his requests for monetary damages to remedy NDCS’s refusal to\nmail his drawings to his mother and the Maoists—were not moot. Keup counters\nHopkins and Bakewell waived any right to appellate review of this issue. Keup points\nout that, although Hopkins and Bakewell pressed their mootness defenses in their\nsummary judgment motion, they failed to reassert their mootness defenses at trial.\nHopkins and Bakewell do not respond to Keup’s waiver argument.\n\n       Ordinarily we “will not review a district court’s denial of a motion for summary\njudgment after a trial on the merits.” EEOC v.

As a\ngeneral rule, a litigant must renew summary judgment arguments in Rule 50 motions\nfor judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiff’s case-in-chief and again\nafter the jury’s verdict. See Eaddy, 317 F.3d at 916. After scouring the trial\ntranscript, it appears Hopkins and Bakewell did not raise their mootness defenses at\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The district court reduced the hourly rates of Keup’s attorneys to $150 per\nhour, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(3), because Keup’s attorneys sought payment\nat a rate in excess of 150% of the hourly rate established for court-appointed counsel.\n\n                                         -7-\n\f      A narrow exception to the general rule, however, applies in this case.\n“Questions of mootness are matters of subject matter jurisdiction[.]” Charleston\nHousing Auth. v.

NDCS’s\ndecision to amend the OM in September 2005 mooted any need for prospective\ninjunctive or declaratory relief, but the amendment did not deprive Keup of the\nopportunity to seek monetary damages for prior violations of his constitutional rights.\nSee, e.g., Watts v. Brewer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361327\"><a href=\"/opinion/361327/hayden-j-watts-v-lou-v-brewer-warden-iowa-state-penitentiary-and-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648 (8th Cir. 1978) (holding the plaintiff’s\nrelease from prison “mooted his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief but [did]\nnot moot[] his claim for monetary damages”); see also Lowry ex rel.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1526</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009).\n\n        B.     Exhaustion\n        Hopkins and Bakewell maintain Keup failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies with respect to his request for monetary damages to remedy NDCS’s refusal\nto mail his drawings to the Maoists. Hopkins and Bakewell interpret § 1997e to\nrequire plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to all claims\nasserted in a lawsuit before filing the lawsuit. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (“No action\nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [§] 1983 . . . by a prisoner\nconfined in any . . . prison . . . until such administrative remedies as are available are\nexhausted.”). They point out Keup did not exhaust his administrative remedies (if he\ndid so at all) until after he filed the complaint. Indeed, the incidents of concern giving\nrise to the new claims did not occur until after Keup filed his complaint. Hopkins and\nBakewell aver the district court should not have permitted Keup to amend his\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fcomplaint to bootstrap the new claims into this lawsuit. Instead, Hopkins and\nBakewell insist Keup should have filed a second lawsuit.\n\n       Keup rejoins Hopkins and Bakewell waived any right to appellate review of this\nissue, because Hopkins and Bakewell did not press their exhaustion defenses at trial.\nAgain, Hopkins and Bakewell do not respond to Keup’s waiver argument.\n\n        After reviewing the trial transcript, it appears Hopkins and Bakewell failed to\nraise their exhaustion defenses at trial. Unlike the issue of mootness, which is\njurisdictional, “reliance on [§ 1997e(a)’s] exhaustion requirement can be waived.”\nFoulk v.

By failing to reassert their exhaustion defenses\nat trial, Hopkins and Bakewell waived them. See Eaddy, 317 F.3d at 916 (“Even a\ncursory review of precedent in this Circuit reveals that we do not review a denial of\na summary-judgment motion after a full trial on the merits.”).\n\n      C.      Attorney Fees\n              1.     Keup is a Prevailing Party\n        Because the district court directed a verdict in Keup’s favor as to some of his\n§ 1983 claims, he is a “prevailing party” entitled to attorney fees under § 1988.\nHopkins and Bakewell argue a voluntary change in a defendant’s behavior—such as\nNDCS’s decision to amend the OM—standing alone does not qualify a plaintiff as a\n“prevailing party.” See Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of\nHealth & Human Res., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (2001). Keup, however, won a finding of\nliability and an award of nominal damages from the district court. The district court’s\nrulings created a sufficient “court-ordered ‘chang[e] [in] the legal relationship\nbetween the’” parties to support an attorney fees award under § 1988. Id. at 604\n(citation omitted); see, e.g., Ollis v. HearthStone Homes, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1394718\"><a href=\"/opinion/1394718/ollis-v-hearthstone-homes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (8th\nCir. 2007) (affirming the district court’s holding that a plaintiff was a prevailing party\neven though he only received nominal damages because “[r]egardless of the amount\n\n                                           -9-\n\fof [the] judgment, [the plaintiff] was the prevailing party and, thus, is entitled to an\naward of attorney fees”) (citing Farrar v.

Section 1997e(d)(2) Cap Applies\n       The district court awarded Keup approximately $25,000 in attorney fees even\nthough the court determined Keup was entitled to only $1.00 in nominal damages.\nThe district court’s ruling is contrary to governing precedent. Section 1997e(d)(2)\nprovides, “If the award of attorney’s fees is not greater than 150 percent of the\njudgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.” We have repeatedly construed\nthis “awkwardly worded” statute to cap awards of attorney fees in prisoner rights\ncases to 150% of the monetary damages awarded. When the plaintiff only receives\nnominal damages of $1.00, § 1997e(d)(2) caps attorney fees at $1.50. See, e.g., Royal\nv. Kautzky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786942\"><a href=\"/opinion/786942/jeffery-r-royal-v-walter-kautzky-lowell-brandt-carole-clemens-paul-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725-26 (8th Cir. 2004) (referring to the statute as\n“awkwardly worded” and affirming an attorney fees award of $1.50); Foulk, 262 F.3d\nat 704 (similar); see also Pearson v.

See Foulk, 262 F.3d at 703 n.17 (“However, if\nnon-monetary relief is ordered (whether with or without a monetary award), the\nattorney’s fees cap . . . does not apply.”) (citations omitted); see also Dannenberg v.\nValadez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783030\"><a href=\"/opinion/783030/john-e-dannenberg-v-julio-valadez-acting-warden-of-california-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1073-75 (9th Cir. 2003) (acknowledging exception); Walker,\n257 F.3d at 667 n.2 (same); Boivin, 225 F.3d at 41 n.4 (same). The problem for Keup\nis that he did not obtain non-monetary relief. The district court’s passing statement\nin its order awarding attorney fees that it “grant[ed Keup] the declaratory and\ninjunctive relief he sought” lacks support in the record. The district court’s other\n\n                                         -10-\n\forders and the terms of its formal judgments make clear the court did not award Keup\nnon-monetary relief, instead dismissing all claims for declaratory or injunctive relief.\nEven if the district court’s orders somehow could be construed as awarding Keup a\ndeclaratory judgment, we hold such a declaratory judgment would be insufficient to\navoid the cap in § 1997e(d)(2). See, e.g., Pearson, 471 F.3d at 743 (holding that,\nwhere a request for equitable relief was mooted, any declaratory judgment would not\nconstitute “other relief” distinct from nominal damages to dodge the cap) (citing\nRhodes v. Stewart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112151\"><a href=\"/opinion/112151/rhodes-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1988) (per curiam) (stating a declaratory judgment\n“will constitute relief, for purposes of § 1988, if, and only if, it affects the behavior\nof the defendant toward the plaintiff”)). Because any declaratory judgment inferred\nfrom the district court’s orders and judgments here would not affect the behavior of\nHopkins and Bakewell toward Keup, Keup is entitled to no more than $1.50 in\nattorney fees. See id.\n\n             3.      Lack of Success\n      Hopkins and Bakewell argue the district court abused its discretion in\ncalculating the amount of Keup’s attorney fees award. For example, Hopkins and\nBakewell point out the district court failed to reduce Keup’s attorney fees for his lack\nof success at trial and his failure to win his complaints about the greeting card and\nbondage sketchbook incidents. See, e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440\n(1983) (“We hold that the extent of a plaintiff’s success is a crucial factor in\ndetermining the proper amount of . . . attorney’s fees[.]”). Because § 1997e(d)(2) caps\nKeup’s attorney fees award at a scant $1.50, we need not reach this argument.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n      We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for reduction of the attorney fees\naward to $1.50.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f</pre>",
