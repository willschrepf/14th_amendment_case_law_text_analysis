Holder, 1 which declared\n\nsection four of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 2 unconstitutional, impacts the\n\nBeaumont Independent School District’s3 trustee election, presently scheduled on\n\nNovember 5, 2013. The November election, previously scheduled in May 2013,\n\ndid not occur in May because it was enjoined by a federal court exercising\n\njurisdiction over BISD’s suit seeking preclearance. See Voting Rights Act of 1965,\n\n42 U.S.C.S. §§ 1973b(b) (section four, found to be unconstitutional on June 25,\n\n2013, approximately one month after the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia enjoined the BISD trustee election scheduled for May 2013),\n\n1973c (section five, the section that includes the Act’s preclearance requirement).\n\n      BISD’s preclearance case in federal court concerned a change in the manner\n\ntrustees were to be elected to the Board. Prior to the 2010 census, all seven BISD\n\ntrustees were elected from single-member districts. In May 2011, BISD’s voters\n\npassed a proposition specifying that the next BISD trustee election be held using\n      1\n         Shelby Cnty., Ala. v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. 2612, 2631 (2013).\n      2\n         Throughout this Opinion we refer to the Voting Rights Act by its common\nname and designated sections.\n       3\n         In this Opinion, we refer to the district as BISD and to its Board of Trustees\nas the Board. The actions referred to in this Opinion were taken by various BISD\nagents and employees under the direction and authority of the Board.\n                                          2\n\ffive single-member and two at-large districts (a 5-2 plan). Under the Texas\n\nEducation Code, the plan approved by voters is required to be implemented\n\nbeginning with the first regular election of trustees following the voter’s adoption\n\nof the proposition. Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.052(e) (West 2012).\n\n      The trial court rendered the order now on appeal following a hearing\n\nbetween BISD and three individuals who filed to run in the aborted May 2013\n\nelection. Reasoning that the plan adopted by voters was not capable of being\n\napproved in federal court, the trial court denied the individuals who filed in the\n\nMay election the relief they sought, and allowed the Board to conduct its trustee\n\nelection under a seven single-member district plan with no at-large districts.\n\n      We disapprove of the trial court’s application of federal law to the issues\n\nbefore it, as federal law no longer requires BISD to obtain preclearance to conduct\n\nits elections and it must now comply with State law. We conclude the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by approving the Board’s order and by sanctioning an election\n\nthat is designed to be conducted in violation of State laws. The trial court’s order,\n\nas well as the trial court’s findings and conclusions that are inconsistent with this\n\nCourt’s opinion are reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with the Court’s opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                     Background\n\n      After BISD failed to obtain the permission of the Department of Justice to\n\nconduct a trustee election on May 11, 2013, under an election map referred to by\n\nthe parties as Map 7b, BISD rescheduled its trustee election for November 5, 2013.\n\nBefore scheduling the November 5 election, the Board adopted a resolution\n\nrequiring that the election take place using another seven single-member district\n\nmap, Map 7i.\n\n      Subsequently, seeking to enforce their rights under the BISD-ordered May\n\nelection, Marcelino Rodriguez, Donna Jean Forgas, and Linda Marie Wiltz\n\nGilmore, three individuals who had filed for trustee positions in the May 2013\n\nelection that used Map 7b to define the seven trustee-district boundaries, amended\n\ntheir petition in a suit they had previously filed in the 172nd District Court of\n\nJefferson County, Texas, to challenge the legality of the November election. In\n\ntheir first amended petition, which is their live pleading for purposes of this appeal,\n\nForgas, Rodriguez, and Gilmore (the putative trustees) asked the trial court to\n\ndeclare, among other things, that BISD was required to conduct the election\n\n“according to the 5-2 election scheme approved . . . by Beaumont voters[.]”\n\nSeeking to require that BISD conduct the November 2013 election “according to\n\nthe 5-2 election scheme[,]” or to recognize their right to serve as trustees under\n\n                                          4\n\fMap 7b, or to require that BISD use Map 7b in the November election, the putative\n\ntrustees asked the trial court to issue a writ of mandamus and grant them temporary\n\nor permanent injunctive relief to prevent BISD from using Map 7i in the upcoming\n\nNovember 5 election.\n\n      BISD answered and filed a counterclaim, asking the trial court to declare\n\nthat BISD could “move forward with an election on November 5, 2013, under a\n\nsingle-member district plan[.]” In the trial court, BISD claimed that using Map 7i\n\nfor an election in November was “both the lawful and equitable course of action\n\nconsidering the unique circumstances.”\n\n      In September 2013, the trial court conducted a hearing on the putative\n\ntrustees’ request for mandamus and injunctive relief; however, the other claims\n\nraised by the pleadings of BISD and the putative trustees, consisting of all claims\n\nfor declaratory relief and BISD’s claim seeking to have the court approve the\n\nNovember election, were claims that neither party raised for the purpose of the\n\nSeptember hearing. Additionally, the parties’ claims for declaratory relief and\n\nBISD’s request asking the court to approve the November election were not\n\nmatters the court had scheduled for trial. During the September hearing, BISD’s\n\nattorney specifically objected to the trial court proceeding on any claims other than\n\nthe putative trustees’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief, stating: “[W]e\n\n                                         5\n\fhave not been provided 45 days for a final trial on the merits. So, we would object\n\nto hearing the case on the merits.”\n\n      Approximately one week after the trial court heard the putative trustees’\n\nclaims for injunctive and mandamus relief, the trial court signed an order denying\n\nrelief. Nevertheless, the trial court’s findings and conclusions went further,\n\naddressing and resolving the majority, if not all, of the claims for declaratory relief,\n\nas well as BISD’s request asking the court to approve the November election.\n\n      The putative trustees timely perfected an accelerated appeal and filed a\n\npetition for writ of mandamus seeking to compel the Board and its officers to use\n\nMap 7b with respect to the scheduled November 5 election, or to require that the\n\nBoard declare the putative trustees elected to office. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n\nCode Ann. § 51.014(a)(4) (West Supp. 2012) (providing accelerated interlocutory\n\nappeal for decisions that address injunctions); Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 273.061\n\n(West 2010) (providing mandamus authority to compel the performance of any\n\nduty imposed by law in connection with the holding of an election). We\n\nconsolidated the matters to review the putative trustees’ claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                                        Discussion\n\n      Although we have previously considered matters related to the May 2013\n\nBISD trustee election, 4 this is our first occasion to consider BISD’s election order\n\nrequiring an election in November 2013, and to consider how the United States\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Shelby County, decided approximately three months\n\nafter we decided issues arising from BISD’s order concerning a May 2013 trustee\n\nelection, affects the November 2013 trustee election. BISD issued the election\n\norder for the November election in August 2013, ordering a general election with\n\nrespect to the positions of three of the Board’s seven trustees. The November\n\nelection has been planned using Map 7i, an election map adopted by the Board of\n\nTrustees in May 2013. 5 Map 7i calls for an election plan to elect BISD’s seven\n\n      4\n         In re Rodriguez, 397 S.W.3d 817 (Tex.

App.—Beaumont\nMar. 18, 2013, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.).\n       5\n         In August 2012, the Board adopted a redistricting map for the 2013 board\nof trustee elections calling for the election of trustees from five single-member\nelection districts and two at-large election districts, a 5-2 plan. BISD submitted the\nmap to the Department of Justice for preclearance; but, in December 2012, the\nDepartment of Justice objected to BISD’s request for preclearance of the proposed\n5-2 election map. BISD has never issued an order calling for an election under a 5-\n                                          7\n\ftrustees from seven single-member districts, and Map 7i depicts the election\n\nboundaries for the seven trustee positions. The election order now at issue calls for\n\na November 2013 election in trustee districts four, six, and seven.\n\n      Although BISD voters passed a proposition to elect BISD trustees under a 5-\n\n2 plan in 2011, and BISD presented a 5-2 map to obtain preclearance for a 5-2\n\nelection map, litigation subsequently arose concerning the election map that BISD\n\nhad proposed to use for its next regular general election of trustees; under federal\n\nlaw that still applied in May 2013, the May 2013 election was enjoined by the\n\nfederal court exercising jurisdiction over BISD’s preclearance litigation.\n\nUltimately, in August 2013, after a May election was no longer possible, the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia Division dismissed\n\nBISD’s preclearance litigation, following the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Shelby County.\n\n      In dismissing BISD’s preclearance litigation, the federal court exercising\n\njurisdiction over BISD’s preclearance case issued an order that states the\n\nrescheduling of BISD’s trustee election “is a matter of Texas election law, which\n\n\n\n2 plan, but the Attorney General made no determination with regard to Map 5f, and\nno federal court has decided whether the 5-2 map that BISD originally proposed,\nor any 5-2 map, violates the provisions of any of the various sections of the Voting\nRights Act, including section two.\n                                          8\n\fappears to have sufficient resources to resolve the matter without this court’s\n\ninvolvement.” Moreover, while the parties were before the federal court, that court\n\ndeclined a request to use its authority under the Voting Rights Act to enter an order\n\nrelieving BISD of various requirements that are found in governing Texas statutes\n\nregulating BISD’s next trustee election. Under section 11.052(e) of the Texas\n\nEducation Code, when the voters of a school district have passed a proposition\n\nrequiring that trustees of a district be elected in a specific manner, the “trustees of\n\nthe district shall be elected in the manner prescribed by the approved\n\nproposition[,]” beginning with the next regular election of trustees. See Tex. Educ.\n\nCode Ann. § 11.052(e) (emphasis added).\n\n      Both parties asked the 172nd District Court to solve a problem that resulted\n\nfrom the federal court’s imposing preclearance requirements on an election\n\nauthorized by a statute whose preclearance requirements have now been rendered\n\nunenforceable as a collateral consequence of the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nShelby County. Nevertheless, the parties asked the trial court to impose voting\n\nplans that call for trustees to be elected under plans that do not include two at-large\n\ndistricts. The plans proposed by both BISD and the putative trustees are each\n\ninconsistent with the 5-2 manner of electing trustees adopted by BISD’s voters. See\n\nTex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.052(e). To further compound the problem, the 172nd\n\n                                          9\n\fDistrict Court abused its discretion by looking to federal law that no longer\n\nprovides the guiding rules for the election of school trustees and by failing to\n\nproperly apply State law in deciding whether to grant the putative trustees’\n\nrequests for relief, reasoning that federal law prevented it from enforcing the\n\nLegislature’s mandate in the Education Code regarding the requirement that\n\nBISD’s next regular election be conducted using a 5-2 plan.\n\n      The putative trustees, in connection with their request for injunctive relief,\n\nasked the trial court to require the Board to seat them as trustees under the election\n\norder calling for the May 2013 election or to require the Board to conduct the\n\nNovember election using the election map, Map 7b, which the Board had approved\n\nusing in the May 2013 election. We review a trial court’s ruling on a temporary\n\ninjunction case using a standard of abuse of discretion. Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co.,\n\n84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex. 2002). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court\n\nacts in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner. See Downer v. Aquamarine\n\nOperators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985). “The test for abuse of\n\ndiscretion is whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules or\n\nprinciples.” E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549,\n\n558 (Tex. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      Although BISD’s preclearance case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, it\n\nappears the trial court looked to federal law and not State law for the controlling\n\nrules and principles in resolving the issues that were before it. Here, in reaching its\n\nconclusions, the trial court assessed which of the various maps, the one proposed\n\nby the putative trustees, the one BISD selected for the November election, or a 5-2\n\nmap, were likely to be the subject of future claims arising under the Voting Rights\n\nAct. However, under the Voting Rights Act, Congress gave federal courts\n\njurisdiction to address the enforcement of the Act; it did not give state courts\n\njurisdiction over Voting Rights Act claims. See 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 1973a(a);\n\n1973b(a)(5); 1973c(a); 1973h(c); 1973j(d), (f); 1973aa. Nevertheless, the trial\n\ncourt’s order relies heavily on its view that it was tasked to apply what remains of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act in the wake of the Court’s decision in Shelby County.\n\n      The trial court’s initial error in deciding that federal law provided the\n\ncontrolling principles caused it to erroneously conclude that BISD could be\n\nexcused from applying various State law requirements that control BISD’s trustee\n\nelection. In reviewing the putative trustees’ claims that BISD had abused its\n\ndiscretion in ordering a November 2013 election, the trial court disregarded that\n\nState law required the election to occur under a 5-2 plan, and it also overlooked the\n\nEducation Code’s provision that requires—in BISD’s case—that it conduct its\n\n                                          11\n\ftrustee elections jointly with either the City or with the State and County elections\n\non uniform election dates (absent a court order ordering the election on another\n\ndate). No court order existed when BISD ordered the November election, and the\n\ntrial court’s findings fail to take note that BISD was not authorized to order an\n\nelection to occur on dates outside the dates provided by State law. Nonetheless,\n\ndespite the fact that no court order was in place when BISD issued its election\n\norder for the November election, the trial court’s order then refers to the November\n\nelection as “appropriate and justified[,]” and characterizes BISD’s conduct in\n\nscheduling the election as proper. See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.0581 (West\n\n2012) (mandating that school trustee elections be conducted in a joint election with\n\neither city elections or general elections for State and county officers).\n\n      With respect to a November 2013 election, the Education Code provision\n\nthat governs trustee elections for independent school districts does not provide that\n\nan election of school trustees can occur in November of odd-numbered years when\n\nno City or State and County officials are being elected; consequently, BISD’s order\n\ncalling for a November 2013 trustee election orders the election to occur on a date\n\nthe Legislature has not authorized for trustee elections to occur. 6 See id. (requiring\n\n      6\n       While it is clear that a court, acting under section 41.001(b)(3) of the\nElection Code, has some ability to provide a political entity with alternate dates for\nan election, BISD did not file suit seeking to have a trial court order an election;\n                                          12\n\fjoint elections); see also Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §§ 41.001(a) (West Supp. 2012)\n\n(establishing uniform election dates), 41.004 (West 2010) (requiring special\n\nelection to be held on uniform election date), 41.008 (West 2010) (an election held\n\non a date not permitted by subchapter 41A is void).\n\n      The putative trustees, like the trial court, have also not properly considered\n\nthe consequences of the federal court’s dismissal of BISD’s preclearance case or\n\nthat court’s instruction to resolve questions regarding BISD’s upcoming trustee\n\nelection as a matter of State law. Like the November election, the order calling for\n\nthe May election on which the putative trustees focus is also a creature of federal\n\npreclearance requirements—that election was also to occur using a map that\n\nincluded no at-large districts, a consequence of objections lodged by the\n\n\n\ninstead, BISD ordered the election and has asked the trial court for permission to\ngo forward on the date that it already selected. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §\n41.001(b)(3) (West Supp. 2012). While the November date BISD has chosen is a\nuniform election date, it is not a date that a joint election with City or State and\nCounty officials is being conducted, a separate requirement that applies to school\ntrustee elections under the Education Code. See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.0581\n(West 2012). It is not clear whether a trial court, acting under section 41.001(b)(3)\nof the Election Code, has the discretion to order an election on a date when the\nelection cannot be conducted in conjunction with the election of City or State and\nCounty officials. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 41.001. Nevertheless, that issue has\nnot been briefed by the parties, and we need not resolve that potential issue\nbecause BISD also violated the Education Code’s requirements by ordering an\nelection that includes no at-large districts contrary to a proposition approved by\nvoters since BISD’s last trustee election.\n                                         13\n\fDepartment of Justice under preclearance proceedings that have since been\n\ndismissed.\n\n      Nevertheless, the putative trustees maintain they have rights under BISD’s\n\norder calling for the May election. According to the putative trustees, BISD did not\n\nhave the authority to cancel the order calling for the May 2013 election. See Tex.\n\nElec. Code Ann. § 2.082 (West 2010) (“An authority that orders an election may\n\ncancel the election only if the power to cancel the election is specifically provided\n\nby statute.”). Although the putative trustees acknowledge the May election was\n\nenjoined by the federal court exercising jurisdiction over BISD’s preclearance\n\ncase, they contend the May election order should now be enforced. But, due to the\n\nfederal court’s injunction, the May election never occurred.\n\n      After the May election was enjoined, BISD continued to negotiate for\n\npreclearance, ultimately seeking preclearance on a map that would have allowed, if\n\napproved by the federal court, an election in a manner contrary to the 5-2 plan that\n\nhad been approved by BISD’s voters. Nonetheless, under the Voting Rights Act,\n\nthe federal preclearance court could have approved BISD’s election of trustees in a\n\nmanner inconsistent with State law. It never did so. While the single-member\n\ndistrict maps at issue in the trial court are both creatures of federal statutory\n\npreclearance requirements that existed prior to the proceedings now at issue, both\n\n                                         14\n\fBISD and the putative trustees have failed to recognize that after Shelby County\n\nissued, they were operating in a new landscape.\n\n      Given the relatively short time period the parties have had to react to the\n\ndecision in Shelby County, confusion concerning the impact of Shelby County on\n\nthe scheduled November election is understandable. For instance, in each of our\n\nprior opinions, all of which pre-date Shelby County, we incorrectly assumed that\n\nthe federal court would ultimately act on BISD’s preclearance request, hear the\n\nparties’ Voting Rights Act arguments on their merits, and exercise the authority\n\ngranted by Congress to approve an election map and an election on an alternate\n\ndate, even if State law provided otherwise. 7 But, our assumption that BISD would\n\nachieve preclearance proved incorrect; and, the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Shelby County, together with the dismissal of BISD’s preclearance\n\nrequest for lack of jurisdiction, prevent the putative trustees, BISD, and the trial\n\ncourt from using federal preclearance requirements to excuse BISD’s failure to\n\ncomply with State statutes, as they now provide the guiding rules that govern\n\nBISD’s next trustee election. See Shelby Cnty., 133 S.Ct. at 2631.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      See Rodriguez I, 397 S.W.3d at 822; Neil I, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 4047, at\n*2, Rodriguez II, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 9586, at *7; Neil II, 2013 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 9585, at *2; Jones, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 2857, at **2-3.\n                                        15\n\f      While the putative trustees argue that BISD could not legally cancel the May\n\nelection order, we conclude that order was rendered moot by the injunctive relief\n\ngranted by the federal court hearing BISD’s preclearance request. We further\n\nconclude that the putative trustees, who were never seated as elected trustees,\n\ngained no rights to have the election order calling for the May 2013 election\n\nenforced, nor did the putative trustees gain any right to be seated as trustees by\n\nvirtue of the moot election order. BISD’s trustees do not have a duty to implement\n\na moot order; consequently, the relators have not shown they are entitled to\n\nmandamus relief from this Court. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 273.061.\n\n      In an effort to avoid the statutory limits that exist on a court in approving its\n\nNovember election order, BISD argues that it has sovereign authority to schedule\n\nan election. The trial court agreed, citing cases that do not support its ruling. See\n\nYett v. Cook, 281 S.W. 837 (Tex. 1926); Castillo v. State ex. rel. Saenz, 404\n\nS.W.2d 97, 97-98 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio 1966, no writ). In Yett, the City\n\nof Austin amended its city charter to change its form of government, but called for\n\nan election too soon to enable election officials to comply with then-existing\n\nelection law concerning poll tax lists. 281 S.W. at 838-39. The Texas Supreme\n\nCourt held the provision of the charter that required the election to be held on an\n\nimpossible date was void. 281 S.W. at 838-39. The court reasoned the import of\n\n                                         16\n\fthe legislation was that the election be held, not the date of the election; although it\n\nwas impossible to conduct an election on the date stated in the city’s charter for the\n\ninitial special election, that did not mean no election could ever be held. Id. at 839-\n\n40. Relying on a provision in the charter that allowed the city council to take\n\ncorrective action to correct deficiencies, the court held the council had the\n\nauthority to conform its election date to the general election law, and that it could\n\nbe required to do so through mandamus. Id. at 843. Yett does not support BISD’s\n\nassertion that it possesses extra-statutory authority to call for an election where that\n\nelection would violate other mandatory statutory provisions that apply to a trustee\n\nelection that is required to be conducted in a certain manner based on a proposition\n\npassed by a school district’s voters.\n\n      Castillo also does not support the proposition that political subdivisions\n\npossess extra-statutory authority to order elections under circumstances that violate\n\nState law. 404 S.W.2d at 97. In Castillo, a city was newly-incorporated on March\n\n30th; at their first meeting on April 5, the initial commissioners set the first\n\nelection for June 5. Id. at 98. Without notice or order for election, a different\n\npolitical faction conducted an election on the regular election date, April 6, and\n\nseveral members of that faction were elected commissioners. Id. Subsequently, in a\n\nquo warranto proceeding to determine who had the right to be seated as\n\n                                          17\n\fcommissioners, the trial court ousted the commissioners who prevailed in the June\n\nelection and installed the commissioners elected in the April 6 election. Id. On\n\nappeal, the court reasoned that the city’s recent incorporation made it impossible to\n\nconduct the city’s initial election on the regular election day, and declared the\n\nApril 6 election void. Id. at 99. The court reasoned that the time and the place for\n\nelections are generally held to be of the essence with respect to an election, but\n\nwhere it was impossible to hold an election at the time and in the manner\n\nprescribed by the Election Code, and where the only other alternative would be to\n\nnever hold the election, the election should be held within a reasonable time. 8 Id.\n\nThus, Castillo does not concern whether a court may authorize relief regarding\n\nschool board elections that violate mandatory provisions in the Education Code, an\n\nissue the trial court resolved during the hearing now on appeal, nor did Castillo\n\naddress a court being asked to approve an election before the election occurred.\n\nInstead, Castillo addresses the effect of elections that were conducted after the\n\nelections had occurred.\n\n      The preclearance court also never issued an order authorizing BISD to\n\nconduct the election using Map 7i, a single-member district map, even though that\n\n      8\n       We note that the current version of the Election Code provides for a city to\nchange the date of its general election to another authorized uniform date. See Tex.\nElec. Code Ann. § 41.0052 (West Supp. 2012).\n                                         18\n\fcourt was asked to do so before it dismissed BISD’s preclearance case. Before the\n\nSupreme Court decided Shelby County, BISD and the Department of Justice filed a\n\nmotion in federal court seeking approval for a November 5 election date utilizing\n\nMap 7i, a seven single-member district plan. The federal court did not act before\n\nthe Supreme Court invalidated the formulas used under the Voting Rights Act to\n\ndetermine which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance requirements. Shelby\n\nCnty., 133 S.Ct. at 2631. In overturning section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, the\n\nSupreme Court noted that the coverage formula was reenacted by Congress “based\n\non 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.” Id. at 2629.\n\n      Whether the Justice Department utilized these same formulas in formulating\n\nits preclearance decisions is not apparent; but, because the Supreme Court\n\noverturned the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance requirements, the Justice\n\nDepartment is now required to prove, not just object, that the election map is\n\nracially discriminatory should it choose to file a future claim regarding any\n\nparticular 5-2 plan BISD might decide to adopt. See 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973. Since the\n\nDepartment of Justice will have the burden of proving any claim that all 5-2 plans\n\nBISD might adopt would be discriminatory on the basis of race in a district where\n\nthe demographics reflect that the district’s largest single racial group is comprised\n\nof persons of African-American descent, we cannot know or predict whether the\n\n                                         19\n\ffederal government will even attempt to interrupt BISD’s future elections under a\n\nhypothetical 5-2 plan. Nevertheless, we do not intend to suggest that BISD cannot\n\nobtain state court approval to conduct a legal election. Nor are we suggesting to\n\nBISD that it adopt a particular election map, except that the map BISD adopts for\n\nits now-delayed regular trustee election must, by State law, allow for the election\n\nof trustees from two at-large districts to carry out the proposition passed by BISD’s\n\nvoters regarding the manner of electing BISD’s trustees. See Tex. Const. Art. II, §\n\n1; Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.052(e).\n\n      When BISD was unable to conduct its trustee election in May, it was on\n\nnotice that it needed court approval to conduct the election now at issue. Having\n\nbeen denied that permission in federal court, BISD should have requested that the\n\n172nd District Court order a legal election under the requirements of State law. It\n\ndid not; instead, it asked the trial court to approve an election under a map that fails\n\nto include two at-large districts. Moreover, in ruling on the putative trustees’\n\nrequest for injunctive relief, the trial court should not have made what appear to be\n\nfinal decisions on disputed facts, as the purpose of a temporary injunction “is to\n\npreserve the status quo of the litigation’s subject matter pending a trial on the\n\nmerits.” Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. Because the only question before the trial\n\ncourt in a temporary injunction hearing is whether the applicant is entitled to\n\n                                          20\n\fpreserve the status quo pending trial on the merits, a trial court errs if it grants\n\npermanent relief in an injunctive order. See Elliott v. Lewis, 792 S.W.2d 853, 854\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, no writ). In our opinion, although the trial court’s order\n\nstates that the court is denying injunctive relief, the order goes far beyond\n\npreserving the status quo. A trial court cannot, by the use of the power delegated\n\nby the Legislature to order alternate election dates, approve an election that\n\nviolates the mandatory requirements for elections of trustees established by the\n\nLegislature. By issuing an order approving BISD’s planned November election, the\n\ntrial court reached beyond the matters necessary for its decision to deny the\n\nputative trustees’ requests for relief.\n\n        While BISD has also argued that it remains subject to electing trustees in\n\nsingle-member districts under the requirements of an order rendered by the United\n\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in 1985, and the trial court\n\nrelied on that 1985 order in concluding that federal requirements prevented it from\n\napproving an election under a 5-2 plan, the 1985 order does not control BISD’s\n\nelections. The order, introduced during the hearing, provides that “[a]ll\n\nmodifications of the adopted plan are hereby enjoined until receipt of the 1990\n\nFederal census data[.]” There is no indication in the record showing that BISD ever\n\nreturned to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas after\n\n                                          21\n\fthe 1990 census. By its express terms, the 1985 order expired following BISD’s\n\nreceipt of the 1990 census.\n\n      Although we disagree with the trial court’s decision to issue findings that\n\nrelate to a determination about claims of discrimination that have not yet been\n\nmade by the Department of Justice and may never be made in the aftermath of\n\nShelby County, we are nevertheless inclined to agree that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying the putative trustees’ the relief they requested by\n\nwrit of mandamus or their request for injunctive relief. See generally Robinson v.\n\nParker, 353 S.W.3d 753, 756 (Tex. 2011) (instructing courts to avoid “‘advising\n\nwhat the law would be on a hypothetical set of facts’”) (quoting Patterson v.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Houston & Se. Tex., Inc., 971 S.W.2d 439, 444 (Tex.\n\n1998)); see also McAllen Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Cortez, 66 S.W.3d 227, 232 (Tex.\n\n2001) (discussing advisory opinions).\n\n      In our opinion, the putative trustees were not entitled to be installed as\n\ntrustees under BISD’s order for the May election because subsequent events\n\nrendered that election moot: the federal injunction that prevented the election from\n\noccurring as well as the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County.\n\nSee generally In re Uresti, 377 S.W.3d 696, 696 (Tex. 2012); Bd. of Tr. of\n\nGeorgetown Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kreger, 369 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1963)\n\n                                        22\n\f(concluding that the federal desegregation order mooted dispute over expenditure\n\nof funds for segregated facilities). Regardless, Texas law does not allow a trial\n\ncourt to enjoin an election ordered by a co-equal branch of government, even if\n\nthat election is subject to being later determined that it was conducted in violation\n\nof Texas law. See Blum v. Lanier, 997 S.W.2d 259, 263 & n.6 (Tex. 1999); see\n\nalso City of Dallas v. Dallas Consol. Elec. St. Ry. Co., 148 S.W. 292, 294 (Tex.\n\n1912). Nevertheless, the matters relating to the parties’ respective declaratory\n\njudgment claims were not properly before the trial court during the hearing at\n\nissue, and the trial court abused its discretion in reaching the merits of claims that\n\nwere not properly before it at the hearing.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      The real parties in interest do not have a mandatory duty to declare the\n\nrelators to be unopposed in the November 2013 election or to require the Board to\n\nimplement Map 7b in the November 2013 election; accordingly, the petition for\n\nwrit of mandamus is denied. The trial court’s order and its findings on the motion\n\nfor temporary injunction are reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this Court’s Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f      REVERSED AND REMANDED; PETITION DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     ________________________________\n                                                HOLLIS HORTON\n                                                     Justice\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted on October 10, 2013\nOpinion Delivered October 17, 2013\nBefore McKeithen, C.J., Kreger and Horton, JJ.\n\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\f",

Holder, 1 which declared\n\nsection four of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 2 unconstitutional, impacts the\n\nBeaumont Independent School District’s3 trustee election, presently scheduled on\n\nNovember 5, 2013. The November election, previously scheduled in May 2013,\n\ndid not occur in May because it was enjoined by a federal court exercising\n\njurisdiction over BISD’s suit seeking preclearance. See Voting Rights Act of 1965,\n\n42 U.S.C.S. §§ 1973b(b) (section four, found to be unconstitutional on June 25,\n\n2013, approximately one month after the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia enjoined the BISD trustee election scheduled for May 2013),\n\n1973c (section five, the section that includes the Act’s preclearance requirement).\n\n      BISD’s preclearance case in federal court concerned a change in the manner\n\ntrustees were to be elected to the Board. Prior to the 2010 census, all seven BISD\n\ntrustees were elected from single-member districts. In May 2011, BISD’s voters\n\npassed a proposition specifying that the next BISD trustee election be held using\n      1\n         Shelby Cnty., Ala. v.

The actions referred to in this Opinion were taken by various BISD\nagents and employees under the direction and authority of the Board.\n                                          2\n\ffive single-member and two at-large districts (a 5-2 plan). Under the Texas\n\nEducation Code, the plan approved by voters is required to be implemented\n\nbeginning with the first regular election of trustees following the voter’s adoption\n\nof the proposition. Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.052(e) (West 2012).\n\n      The trial court rendered the order now on appeal following a hearing\n\nbetween BISD and three individuals who filed to run in the aborted May 2013\n\nelection. Reasoning that the plan adopted by voters was not capable of being\n\napproved in federal court, the trial court denied the individuals who filed in the\n\nMay election the relief they sought, and allowed the Board to conduct its trustee\n\nelection under a seven single-member district plan with no at-large districts.\n\n      We disapprove of the trial court’s application of federal law to the issues\n\nbefore it, as federal law no longer requires BISD to obtain preclearance to conduct\n\nits elections and it must now comply with State law. We conclude the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by approving the Board’s order and by sanctioning an election\n\nthat is designed to be conducted in violation of State laws. The trial court’s order,\n\nas well as the trial court’s findings and conclusions that are inconsistent with this\n\nCourt’s opinion are reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with the Court’s opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                     Background\n\n      After BISD failed to obtain the permission of the Department of Justice to\n\nconduct a trustee election on May 11, 2013, under an election map referred to by\n\nthe parties as Map 7b, BISD rescheduled its trustee election for November 5, 2013.\n\nBefore scheduling the November 5 election, the Board adopted a resolution\n\nrequiring that the election take place using another seven single-member district\n\nmap, Map 7i.\n\n      Subsequently, seeking to enforce their rights under the BISD-ordered May\n\nelection, Marcelino Rodriguez, Donna Jean Forgas, and Linda Marie Wiltz\n\nGilmore, three individuals who had filed for trustee positions in the May 2013\n\nelection that used Map 7b to define the seven trustee-district boundaries, amended\n\ntheir petition in a suit they had previously filed in the 172nd District Court of\n\nJefferson County, Texas, to challenge the legality of the November election. In\n\ntheir first amended petition, which is their live pleading for purposes of this appeal,\n\nForgas, Rodriguez, and Gilmore (the putative trustees) asked the trial court to\n\ndeclare, among other things, that BISD was required to conduct the election\n\n“according to the 5-2 election scheme approved . . . by Beaumont voters[.]”\n\nSeeking to require that BISD conduct the November 2013 election “according to\n\nthe 5-2 election scheme[,]” or to recognize their right to serve as trustees under\n\n                                          4\n\fMap 7b, or to require that BISD use Map 7b in the November election, the putative\n\ntrustees asked the trial court to issue a writ of mandamus and grant them temporary\n\nor permanent injunctive relief to prevent BISD from using Map 7i in the upcoming\n\nNovember 5 election.\n\n      BISD answered and filed a counterclaim, asking the trial court to declare\n\nthat BISD could “move forward with an election on November 5, 2013, under a\n\nsingle-member district plan[.]” In the trial court, BISD claimed that using Map 7i\n\nfor an election in November was “both the lawful and equitable course of action\n\nconsidering the unique circumstances.”\n\n      In September 2013, the trial court conducted a hearing on the putative\n\ntrustees’ request for mandamus and injunctive relief; however, the other claims\n\nraised by the pleadings of BISD and the putative trustees, consisting of all claims\n\nfor declaratory relief and BISD’s claim seeking to have the court approve the\n\nNovember election, were claims that neither party raised for the purpose of the\n\nSeptember hearing. Additionally, the parties’ claims for declaratory relief and\n\nBISD’s request asking the court to approve the November election were not\n\nmatters the court had scheduled for trial. During the September hearing, BISD’s\n\nattorney specifically objected to the trial court proceeding on any claims other than\n\nthe putative trustees’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief, stating: “[W]e\n\n                                         5\n\fhave not been provided 45 days for a final trial on the merits. So, we would object\n\nto hearing the case on the merits.”\n\n      Approximately one week after the trial court heard the putative trustees’\n\nclaims for injunctive and mandamus relief, the trial court signed an order denying\n\nrelief. Nevertheless, the trial court’s findings and conclusions went further,\n\naddressing and resolving the majority, if not all, of the claims for declaratory relief,\n\nas well as BISD’s request asking the court to approve the November election.\n\n      The putative trustees timely perfected an accelerated appeal and filed a\n\npetition for writ of mandamus seeking to compel the Board and its officers to use\n\nMap 7b with respect to the scheduled November 5 election, or to require that the\n\nBoard declare the putative trustees elected to office.

App.—Beaumont\nMar. 18, 2013, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.).\n       5\n         In August 2012, the Board adopted a redistricting map for the 2013 board\nof trustee elections calling for the election of trustees from five single-member\nelection districts and two at-large election districts, a 5-2 plan. BISD submitted the\nmap to the Department of Justice for preclearance; but, in December 2012, the\nDepartment of Justice objected to BISD’s request for preclearance of the proposed\n5-2 election map. BISD has never issued an order calling for an election under a 5-\n                                          7\n\ftrustees from seven single-member districts, and Map 7i depicts the election\n\nboundaries for the seven trustee positions. The election order now at issue calls for\n\na November 2013 election in trustee districts four, six, and seven.\n\n      Although BISD voters passed a proposition to elect BISD trustees under a 5-\n\n2 plan in 2011, and BISD presented a 5-2 map to obtain preclearance for a 5-2\n\nelection map, litigation subsequently arose concerning the election map that BISD\n\nhad proposed to use for its next regular general election of trustees; under federal\n\nlaw that still applied in May 2013, the May 2013 election was enjoined by the\n\nfederal court exercising jurisdiction over BISD’s preclearance litigation.\n\nUltimately, in August 2013, after a May election was no longer possible, the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia Division dismissed\n\nBISD’s preclearance litigation, following the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Shelby County.\n\n      In dismissing BISD’s preclearance litigation, the federal court exercising\n\njurisdiction over BISD’s preclearance case issued an order that states the\n\nrescheduling of BISD’s trustee election “is a matter of Texas election law, which\n\n\n\n2 plan, but the Attorney General made no determination with regard to Map 5f, and\nno federal court has decided whether the 5-2 map that BISD originally proposed,\nor any 5-2 map, violates the provisions of any of the various sections of the Voting\nRights Act, including section two.\n                                          8\n\fappears to have sufficient resources to resolve the matter without this court’s\n\ninvolvement.” Moreover, while the parties were before the federal court, that court\n\ndeclined a request to use its authority under the Voting Rights Act to enter an order\n\nrelieving BISD of various requirements that are found in governing Texas statutes\n\nregulating BISD’s next trustee election. Under section 11.052(e) of the Texas\n\nEducation Code, when the voters of a school district have passed a proposition\n\nrequiring that trustees of a district be elected in a specific manner, the “trustees of\n\nthe district shall be elected in the manner prescribed by the approved\n\nproposition[,]” beginning with the next regular election of trustees. See Tex. Educ.\n\nCode Ann. § 11.052(e) (emphasis added).\n\n      Both parties asked the 172nd District Court to solve a problem that resulted\n\nfrom the federal court’s imposing preclearance requirements on an election\n\nauthorized by a statute whose preclearance requirements have now been rendered\n\nunenforceable as a collateral consequence of the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nShelby County. Nevertheless, the parties asked the trial court to impose voting\n\nplans that call for trustees to be elected under plans that do not include two at-large\n\ndistricts. The plans proposed by both BISD and the putative trustees are each\n\ninconsistent with the 5-2 manner of electing trustees adopted by BISD’s voters. See\n\nTex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.052(e). To further compound the problem, the 172nd\n\n                                          9\n\fDistrict Court abused its discretion by looking to federal law that no longer\n\nprovides the guiding rules for the election of school trustees and by failing to\n\nproperly apply State law in deciding whether to grant the putative trustees’\n\nrequests for relief, reasoning that federal law prevented it from enforcing the\n\nLegislature’s mandate in the Education Code regarding the requirement that\n\nBISD’s next regular election be conducted using a 5-2 plan.\n\n      The putative trustees, in connection with their request for injunctive relief,\n\nasked the trial court to require the Board to seat them as trustees under the election\n\norder calling for the May 2013 election or to require the Board to conduct the\n\nNovember election using the election map, Map 7b, which the Board had approved\n\nusing in the May 2013 election.

Here, in reaching its\n\nconclusions, the trial court assessed which of the various maps, the one proposed\n\nby the putative trustees, the one BISD selected for the November election, or a 5-2\n\nmap, were likely to be the subject of future claims arising under the Voting Rights\n\nAct. However, under the Voting Rights Act, Congress gave federal courts\n\njurisdiction to address the enforcement of the Act; it did not give state courts\n\njurisdiction over Voting Rights Act claims. See 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 1973a(a);\n\n1973b(a)(5); 1973c(a); 1973h(c); 1973j(d), (f); 1973aa. Nevertheless, the trial\n\ncourt’s order relies heavily on its view that it was tasked to apply what remains of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act in the wake of the Court’s decision in Shelby County.\n\n      The trial court’s initial error in deciding that federal law provided the\n\ncontrolling principles caused it to erroneously conclude that BISD could be\n\nexcused from applying various State law requirements that control BISD’s trustee\n\nelection. In reviewing the putative trustees’ claims that BISD had abused its\n\ndiscretion in ordering a November 2013 election, the trial court disregarded that\n\nState law required the election to occur under a 5-2 plan, and it also overlooked the\n\nEducation Code’s provision that requires—in BISD’s case—that it conduct its\n\n                                          11\n\ftrustee elections jointly with either the City or with the State and County elections\n\non uniform election dates (absent a court order ordering the election on another\n\ndate). No court order existed when BISD ordered the November election, and the\n\ntrial court’s findings fail to take note that BISD was not authorized to order an\n\nelection to occur on dates outside the dates provided by State law. Nonetheless,\n\ndespite the fact that no court order was in place when BISD issued its election\n\norder for the November election, the trial court’s order then refers to the November\n\nelection as “appropriate and justified[,]” and characterizes BISD’s conduct in\n\nscheduling the election as proper. See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.0581 (West\n\n2012) (mandating that school trustee elections be conducted in a joint election with\n\neither city elections or general elections for State and county officers).\n\n      With respect to a November 2013 election, the Education Code provision\n\nthat governs trustee elections for independent school districts does not provide that\n\nan election of school trustees can occur in November of odd-numbered years when\n\nno City or State and County officials are being elected; consequently, BISD’s order\n\ncalling for a November 2013 trustee election orders the election to occur on a date\n\nthe Legislature has not authorized for trustee elections to occur. 6 See id. (requiring\n\n      6\n       While it is clear that a court, acting under section 41.001(b)(3) of the\nElection Code, has some ability to provide a political entity with alternate dates for\nan election, BISD did not file suit seeking to have a trial court order an election;\n                                          12\n\fjoint elections); see also Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §§ 41.001(a) (West Supp. 2012)\n\n(establishing uniform election dates), 41.004 (West 2010) (requiring special\n\nelection to be held on uniform election date), 41.008 (West 2010) (an election held\n\non a date not permitted by subchapter 41A is void).\n\n      The putative trustees, like the trial court, have also not properly considered\n\nthe consequences of the federal court’s dismissal of BISD’s preclearance case or\n\nthat court’s instruction to resolve questions regarding BISD’s upcoming trustee\n\nelection as a matter of State law. Like the November election, the order calling for\n\nthe May election on which the putative trustees focus is also a creature of federal\n\npreclearance requirements—that election was also to occur using a map that\n\nincluded no at-large districts, a consequence of objections lodged by the\n\n\n\ninstead, BISD ordered the election and has asked the trial court for permission to\ngo forward on the date that it already selected. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §\n41.001(b)(3) (West Supp. 2012). While the November date BISD has chosen is a\nuniform election date, it is not a date that a joint election with City or State and\nCounty officials is being conducted, a separate requirement that applies to school\ntrustee elections under the Education Code. See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.0581\n(West 2012). It is not clear whether a trial court, acting under section 41.001(b)(3)\nof the Election Code, has the discretion to order an election on a date when the\nelection cannot be conducted in conjunction with the election of City or State and\nCounty officials. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 41.001. Nevertheless, that issue has\nnot been briefed by the parties, and we need not resolve that potential issue\nbecause BISD also violated the Education Code’s requirements by ordering an\nelection that includes no at-large districts contrary to a proposition approved by\nvoters since BISD’s last trustee election.\n                                         13\n\fDepartment of Justice under preclearance proceedings that have since been\n\ndismissed.\n\n      Nevertheless, the putative trustees maintain they have rights under BISD’s\n\norder calling for the May election. According to the putative trustees, BISD did not\n\nhave the authority to cancel the order calling for the May 2013 election. See Tex.\n\nElec. Code Ann. § 2.082 (West 2010) (“An authority that orders an election may\n\ncancel the election only if the power to cancel the election is specifically provided\n\nby statute.”). Although the putative trustees acknowledge the May election was\n\nenjoined by the federal court exercising jurisdiction over BISD’s preclearance\n\ncase, they contend the May election order should now be enforced. But, due to the\n\nfederal court’s injunction, the May election never occurred.\n\n      After the May election was enjoined, BISD continued to negotiate for\n\npreclearance, ultimately seeking preclearance on a map that would have allowed, if\n\napproved by the federal court, an election in a manner contrary to the 5-2 plan that\n\nhad been approved by BISD’s voters. Nonetheless, under the Voting Rights Act,\n\nthe federal preclearance court could have approved BISD’s election of trustees in a\n\nmanner inconsistent with State law. It never did so. While the single-member\n\ndistrict maps at issue in the trial court are both creatures of federal statutory\n\npreclearance requirements that existed prior to the proceedings now at issue, both\n\n                                         14\n\fBISD and the putative trustees have failed to recognize that after Shelby County\n\nissued, they were operating in a new landscape.\n\n      Given the relatively short time period the parties have had to react to the\n\ndecision in Shelby County, confusion concerning the impact of Shelby County on\n\nthe scheduled November election is understandable. For instance, in each of our\n\nprior opinions, all of which pre-date Shelby County, we incorrectly assumed that\n\nthe federal court would ultimately act on BISD’s preclearance request, hear the\n\nparties’ Voting Rights Act arguments on their merits, and exercise the authority\n\ngranted by Congress to approve an election map and an election on an alternate\n\ndate, even if State law provided otherwise. 7 But, our assumption that BISD would\n\nachieve preclearance proved incorrect; and, the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Shelby County, together with the dismissal of BISD’s preclearance\n\nrequest for lack of jurisdiction, prevent the putative trustees, BISD, and the trial\n\ncourt from using federal preclearance requirements to excuse BISD’s failure to\n\ncomply with State statutes, as they now provide the guiding rules that govern\n\nBISD’s next trustee election. See Shelby Cnty., 133 S.Ct. at 2631.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      See Rodriguez I, 397 S.W.3d at 822; Neil I, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 4047, at\n*2, Rodriguez II, 2013 Tex.

App. LEXIS 2857, at **2-3.\n                                        15\n\f      While the putative trustees argue that BISD could not legally cancel the May\n\nelection order, we conclude that order was rendered moot by the injunctive relief\n\ngranted by the federal court hearing BISD’s preclearance request. We further\n\nconclude that the putative trustees, who were never seated as elected trustees,\n\ngained no rights to have the election order calling for the May 2013 election\n\nenforced, nor did the putative trustees gain any right to be seated as trustees by\n\nvirtue of the moot election order. BISD’s trustees do not have a duty to implement\n\na moot order; consequently, the relators have not shown they are entitled to\n\nmandamus relief from this Court. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 273.061.\n\n      In an effort to avoid the statutory limits that exist on a court in approving its\n\nNovember election order, BISD argues that it has sovereign authority to schedule\n\nan election. The trial court agreed, citing cases that do not support its ruling. See\n\nYett v. Cook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3948619\"><a href=\"/opinion/4180196/wd-yett-mayor-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1926); Castillo v.

App.—San Antonio 1966, no writ). In Yett, the City\n\nof Austin amended its city charter to change its form of government, but called for\n\nan election too soon to enable election officials to comply with then-existing\n\nelection law concerning poll tax lists. 281 S.W. at 838-39. The Texas Supreme\n\nCourt held the provision of the charter that required the election to be held on an\n\nimpossible date was void. 281 S.W. at 838-39. The court reasoned the import of\n\n                                         16\n\fthe legislation was that the election be held, not the date of the election; although it\n\nwas impossible to conduct an election on the date stated in the city’s charter for the\n\ninitial special election, that did not mean no election could ever be held. Id. at 839-\n\n40. Relying on a provision in the charter that allowed the city council to take\n\ncorrective action to correct deficiencies, the court held the council had the\n\nauthority to conform its election date to the general election law, and that it could\n\nbe required to do so through mandamus. Id. at 843. Yett does not support BISD’s\n\nassertion that it possesses extra-statutory authority to call for an election where that\n\nelection would violate other mandatory statutory provisions that apply to a trustee\n\nelection that is required to be conducted in a certain manner based on a proposition\n\npassed by a school district’s voters.\n\n      Castillo also does not support the proposition that political subdivisions\n\npossess extra-statutory authority to order elections under circumstances that violate\n\nState law. 404 S.W.2d at 97. In Castillo, a city was newly-incorporated on March\n\n30th; at their first meeting on April 5, the initial commissioners set the first\n\nelection for June 5. Id. at 98. Without notice or order for election, a different\n\npolitical faction conducted an election on the regular election date, April 6, and\n\nseveral members of that faction were elected commissioners. Id. Subsequently, in a\n\nquo warranto proceeding to determine who had the right to be seated as\n\n                                          17\n\fcommissioners, the trial court ousted the commissioners who prevailed in the June\n\nelection and installed the commissioners elected in the April 6 election. Id. On\n\nappeal, the court reasoned that the city’s recent incorporation made it impossible to\n\nconduct the city’s initial election on the regular election day, and declared the\n\nApril 6 election void. Id. at 99. The court reasoned that the time and the place for\n\nelections are generally held to be of the essence with respect to an election, but\n\nwhere it was impossible to hold an election at the time and in the manner\n\nprescribed by the Election Code, and where the only other alternative would be to\n\nnever hold the election, the election should be held within a reasonable time. 8 Id.\n\nThus, Castillo does not concern whether a court may authorize relief regarding\n\nschool board elections that violate mandatory provisions in the Education Code, an\n\nissue the trial court resolved during the hearing now on appeal, nor did Castillo\n\naddress a court being asked to approve an election before the election occurred.\n\nInstead, Castillo addresses the effect of elections that were conducted after the\n\nelections had occurred.\n\n      The preclearance court also never issued an order authorizing BISD to\n\nconduct the election using Map 7i, a single-member district map, even though that\n\n      8\n       We note that the current version of the Election Code provides for a city to\nchange the date of its general election to another authorized uniform date. See Tex.\nElec. Code Ann. § 41.0052 (West Supp. 2012).\n                                         18\n\fcourt was asked to do so before it dismissed BISD’s preclearance case. Before the\n\nSupreme Court decided Shelby County, BISD and the Department of Justice filed a\n\nmotion in federal court seeking approval for a November 5 election date utilizing\n\nMap 7i, a seven single-member district plan. The federal court did not act before\n\nthe Supreme Court invalidated the formulas used under the Voting Rights Act to\n\ndetermine which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance requirements. Shelby\n\nCnty., 133 S.Ct. at 2631. In overturning section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, the\n\nSupreme Court noted that the coverage formula was reenacted by Congress “based\n\non 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day.” Id. at 2629.\n\n      Whether the Justice Department utilized these same formulas in formulating\n\nits preclearance decisions is not apparent; but, because the Supreme Court\n\noverturned the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance requirements, the Justice\n\nDepartment is now required to prove, not just object, that the election map is\n\nracially discriminatory should it choose to file a future claim regarding any\n\nparticular 5-2 plan BISD might decide to adopt. See 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973. Since the\n\nDepartment of Justice will have the burden of proving any claim that all 5-2 plans\n\nBISD might adopt would be discriminatory on the basis of race in a district where\n\nthe demographics reflect that the district’s largest single racial group is comprised\n\nof persons of African-American descent, we cannot know or predict whether the\n\n                                         19\n\ffederal government will even attempt to interrupt BISD’s future elections under a\n\nhypothetical 5-2 plan. Nevertheless, we do not intend to suggest that BISD cannot\n\nobtain state court approval to conduct a legal election. Nor are we suggesting to\n\nBISD that it adopt a particular election map, except that the map BISD adopts for\n\nits now-delayed regular trustee election must, by State law, allow for the election\n\nof trustees from two at-large districts to carry out the proposition passed by BISD’s\n\nvoters regarding the manner of electing BISD’s trustees. See Tex. Const. Art. II, §\n\n1; Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 11.052(e).\n\n      When BISD was unable to conduct its trustee election in May, it was on\n\nnotice that it needed court approval to conduct the election now at issue. Having\n\nbeen denied that permission in federal court, BISD should have requested that the\n\n172nd District Court order a legal election under the requirements of State law. It\n\ndid not; instead, it asked the trial court to approve an election under a map that fails\n\nto include two at-large districts. Moreover, in ruling on the putative trustees’\n\nrequest for injunctive relief, the trial court should not have made what appear to be\n\nfinal decisions on disputed facts, as the purpose of a temporary injunction “is to\n\npreserve the status quo of the litigation’s subject matter pending a trial on the\n\nmerits.” Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. Because the only question before the trial\n\ncourt in a temporary injunction hearing is whether the applicant is entitled to\n\n                                          20\n\fpreserve the status quo pending trial on the merits, a trial court errs if it grants\n\npermanent relief in an injunctive order. See Elliott v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1619224\"><a href=\"/opinion/1619224/elliott-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, no writ). In our opinion, although the trial court’s order\n\nstates that the court is denying injunctive relief, the order goes far beyond\n\npreserving the status quo. A trial court cannot, by the use of the power delegated\n\nby the Legislature to order alternate election dates, approve an election that\n\nviolates the mandatory requirements for elections of trustees established by the\n\nLegislature. By issuing an order approving BISD’s planned November election, the\n\ntrial court reached beyond the matters necessary for its decision to deny the\n\nputative trustees’ requests for relief.\n\n        While BISD has also argued that it remains subject to electing trustees in\n\nsingle-member districts under the requirements of an order rendered by the United\n\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in 1985, and the trial court\n\nrelied on that 1985 order in concluding that federal requirements prevented it from\n\napproving an election under a 5-2 plan, the 1985 order does not control BISD’s\n\nelections. The order, introduced during the hearing, provides that “[a]ll\n\nmodifications of the adopted plan are hereby enjoined until receipt of the 1990\n\nFederal census data[.]” There is no indication in the record showing that BISD ever\n\nreturned to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas after\n\n                                          21\n\fthe 1990 census. By its express terms, the 1985 order expired following BISD’s\n\nreceipt of the 1990 census.\n\n      Although we disagree with the trial court’s decision to issue findings that\n\nrelate to a determination about claims of discrimination that have not yet been\n\nmade by the Department of Justice and may never be made in the aftermath of\n\nShelby County, we are nevertheless inclined to agree that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying the putative trustees’ the relief they requested by\n\nwrit of mandamus or their request for injunctive relief.
