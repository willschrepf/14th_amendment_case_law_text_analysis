Johnson and Lynette K. Johnson (collectively,\n\"Johnson\") commenced this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint alleging violations of the\nconstitutional and state law rights of the deceased Ronald Johnson. The district\n\fcourt1 granted summary judgment to defendants. Johnson filed the instant appeal,\narguing summary judgment was improper. We affirm.\n\n                                            I\n\n       Pursuant to the proper standard of review, described below, the following are\nthe facts as most favorable to Johnson. At the time of his death, Ronald Johnson was\na prison guard for the South Dakota State Penitentiary (\"the penitentiary\"), a South\nDakota Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\nOn April 12, 2011, Rodney Berget and Eric Robert, inmates at the penitentiary,\nattempted to escape and in the process intentionally murdered Robert Johnson.\nBerget and Robert were convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.\n\n        Rodney Berget first came to the penitentiary at the age of fifteen after escaping\nat least twice from his placement at South Dakota's State Training School. During\nhis lifetime, Berget amassed multiple convictions for grand theft, burglary, escape,\nand attempt to escape. He spent most of his life in the South Dakota prison system.\nIn addition to his two escapes from the State Training School, Berget escaped from\nthe penitentiary on three separate occasions, the last of which occurred in 1987. None\nof Berget's escapes or escape attempts were violent and although Berget has a history\nof violence, he did not have a history of institutional violence. Berget was last\nincarcerated in 2003, and was initially placed in the maximum security area, but in\n2004 was transferred to the medium security area, West Hall. Berget had various\ndisciplinary problems during this incarceration, including refusing housing\nassignments and conducting hunger strikes. During his incarceration Berget was\ntransferred to segregation at various times and would thereafter return to West Hall.\nThe paperwork for transfers was not always timely and properly completed, and\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Larry Piersol, United States District Judge for the District of\nSouth Dakota.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fJohnson alleges at least some transfers were negotiated in exchange for ending\nhunger strikes.\n\n       Eric Robert had no criminal history when he arrived at the penitentiary in 2006\nto serve an eighty-year sentence for kidnapping. Robert did not have a history of\ninstitutional violence prior to the murder of Ronald Johnson, but in 2007 was\ndiscovered making preparations for an escape attempt. Thereafter, Robert was moved\nto maximum security and the DOC learned through a confidential informant Robert\nhad threatened a correctional officer. Robert conducted a hunger strike and was\nmoved from maximum security into West Hall. The paperwork process was not\nfollowed and Johnson alleges the transfer was negotiated in exchange for ending the\nhunger strike.\n\n       Although no concrete threats or plans were known by any of the defendants,\nthere was some forewarning of an escape attempt. In 2009, the DOC received\ninformation from an inmate indicating Berget and Robert were planning an escape\nattempt. In 2010, the DOC received similar information from a different inmate.\nDuring this same time frame, correctional officer Chester Buie observed Robert and\nBerget had developed a relationship. Johnson heavily relies on a media report\nclaiming the DOC knew Robert and Berget were planning an escape attempt in which\nthey intended to murder a guard. The only evidence Johnson presents indicating the\nDOC may have known of a murder and escape plot comes from a media interview\ngiven immediately after the murder by Jesse Sondreal, the state's attorney who had\nprosecuted Robert and Berget. Sondreal testified he told the media he previously\nlearned about a murder and escape plan. Sondreal's deposition testimony made clear\nthe information did not originate from any of the defendants, but rather came from the\nDepartment of Criminal Investigation. Sondreal could not identify any details of the\nalleged escape and murder plot, but understood the threat to a guard was related to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fRobert's 2007 escape attempt.2 No other witnesses corroborate the information\nSondreal provided to the media and Sondreal could produce no notes or e-mails to\nshow exactly what he learned and from whom.\n\n       Berget and Robert ultimately ended up residing near each other in West Hall.\nAt the time of the murder, Robert held the job of laundry cart pusher, requiring\nRobert to push a cart to and from the laundry building, which was separate from West\nHall. Berget held various orderly jobs during his incarceration and was a trash-\nrecycling orderly at the time of the murder. The jobs held by Robert and Berget did\nnot require direct correctional supervision at all times. Taking advantage of the\nrelative freedoms offered by their jobs, on April 12, 2011, Robert and Berget left\nWest Hall and proceeded to an unauthorized area of the penitentiary where they\nmurdered Ronald Johnson and attempted to escape from the penitentiary. The escape\nattempt was unsuccessful and Robert and Berget were convicted of murder.\n\n       Johnson thereafter commenced this suit in South Dakota state court. Johnson\nnamed as defendants the State of South Dakota; the South Dakota Department of\nCorrections; Douglas Weber, the then-warden at the South Dakota State Penitentiary;\nTroy Ponto, as associate warden; Darin Young, a former associate warden and current\nWarden at the penitentiary; Crystal Van Vooren, a major who has worked for the\nDOC since 1989; Dennis Kaemingk, the Secretary of the DOC whose appointment\nbecame effective on May 2, 2011; Laurie Feiler, the Deputy Secretary of Corrections;\nTimothy A. Reisch, the former Secretary of Corrections until becoming Adjutant\nGeneral for South Dakota on April 2, 2011; and twenty John Does. Johnson brought\na federal constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and five state law claims,\nalleging defendants were constitutionally liable for the murder of Robert Johnson\nbecause Robert and Berget had violent criminal pasts, escape histories, were\n\n\n      2\n       Johnson does not argue Robert's 2007 escape attempt included a plan to\nmurder a prison guard, and no evidence in the record supports such a claim.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fmaximum-security inmates housed in the wrong area, made deals with the Warden,\ndid not have proper classification paperwork, and had too much freedom of\nmovement in their jobs. The defendants removed the action to federal court.\n\n      The district court found defendants entitled to qualified immunity and granted\nsummary judgment on Johnson’s constitutional claims. The district court remanded\nthe remaining state law claims. Johnson appeals.\n\n                                           II\n\n       \"We review a district court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment\nde novo, applying the same standards for summary judgment as the district court.\"\nTusing v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 639 F.3d 507, 514 (8th Cir. 2011).\nSummary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In considering summary judgment motions, the burden\nof demonstrating there are no genuine issues of material fact rests on the moving\nparty, and we review the evidence and the inferences which reasonably may be drawn\nfrom the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Davis v.\nJefferson Hosp. Ass'n, 685 F.3d 675, 680 (8th Cir. 2012). \"'Where the record taken\nas a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there\nis no genuine issue for trial.'\" Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1042\n(8th Cir. 2011) (quoting Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 585 (2009)).\n\n       \"Qualified immunity shields a government official from liability and the\nburdens of litigation in a § 1983 action for damages unless the official's conduct\nviolated a clearly established constitutional or statutory right of which a reasonable\nofficial would have known.\" Chambers v. Pennycook, 641 F.3d 898, 904 (8th Cir.\n2011) (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). Review of a grant of\nsummary judgment based upon the granting of a claim of qualified immunity is a\n\n                                          -5-\n\ftwo-step process. First, we consider whether the evidence demonstrates that the\ndefendants' conduct violated a constitutional right. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n194, 201 (2001). If there was a constitutional violation, we next consider whether the\nright violated was clearly established. See id.\n\n        Johnson's complaint alleges a constitutional due-process claim asserting\nliability for the injury caused to Ronald Johnson by Robert and Berget. \"[N]othing\nin the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,\nliberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.\" DeShaney v.\nWinnebago Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195 (1989) (holding the failure\nof the county's Department of Social Services to provide a child with adequate\nprotection against his father's violence did not violate the child's substantive due\nprocess rights). However, substantive due process does require a state to protect\nindividuals under two specific circumstances. \"First, the state owes a duty to protect\nthose in its custody.\" Hart v. City of Little Rock, 432 F.3d 801, 805 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\"Second, the state owes a duty to protect individuals if it created the danger to which\nthe individuals are subjected.\" Id. Johnson relies on the state-created-danger theory\nof liability.\n\n      \"To succeed on such a theory, [a plaintiff] must prove (1) that [Ronald\nJohnson] was a member of 'a limited, precisely definable group,' (2) that the\n[defendants']3 conduct put [Ronald Johnson] at a 'significant risk of serious,\nimmediate, and proximate harm,' (3) that the risk was 'obvious or known' to the\n[defendants], (4) that the [defendants] 'acted recklessly in conscious disregard of the\n\n\n      3\n        We are cognizant that in § 1983 suits \"each defendant's conduct must be\nindependently assessed\" because § 1983 \"does not sanction tort by association.\"\nHeartland Acad. Cmty. Church v. Waddle, 595 F.3d 798, 805-06 (8th Cir. 2010). In\nthis appeal, we need not separately examine the individual actions of the various\ndefendants because we find, even taking into consideration the acts of all the\ndefendants together, no constitutional rights were violated.\n\n                                          -6-\n\frisk,' and (5) that in total, the [defendants'] conduct 'shocks the conscience.'\" Fields\nv. Abbott, 652 F.3d 886, 891 (8th Cir. 2011) (quoting Hart, 342 F.3d at 805).\n\n       Under the state-created-danger theory, negligence and gross negligence cannot\nsupport a § 1983 claim alleging a violation of substantive due process rights. Hart,\n432 F.3d at 805. \"Instead, actionable substantive due process claims involve a level\nof abuse and power so brutal and offensive that they do not comport with traditional\nideas of fair play and decency.\" Id. at 806 (alterations and internal quotation marks\nomitted). \"The test we employ to ascertain a valid substantive due process violation\nis whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious, so outrageous,\nthat it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.\" Id. at 805\n(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Although proof of intent to harm is usually required, in certain cases proof of\ndeliberate indifference will satisfy this substantive due process threshold. Terrell v.\nLarson, 396 F.3d 975, 978 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc). In cases where \"defendants\nacted under circumstances in which actual deliberation was practical . . . , their\nconduct may shock the conscience of federal judges only if they acted with 'deliberate\nindifference.'\" Moore ex rel. Moore v. Briggs, 381 F.3d 771, 773 (8th Cir. 2004)\n(quoting Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 851-52 (1998)). The deliberate\nindifference standard applied in a substantive due process case is the same as that\napplied in Eighth Amendment cases: \"the official must both be aware of facts from\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and\nhe must also draw the inference.\" Moore, 381 F.3d at 773-74 (citing Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994)).\n\n       On appeal, Johnson argues the district court erred in its analysis of the Hart\nfactors and argues the actions of the defendants shock the conscience. First, Johnson\nalleges the district court erred in taking into account only the most recent housing and\njob assignments in its analysis in light of the temporal requirement of the second Hart\n\n                                          -7-\n\ffactor. We need not determine exactly how \"immediate\" a harm must occur under\nHart, because even considering housing decisions as early as 2004 there is no\nevidence of deliberate indifference or conscious-shocking conduct. We need not\nanalyze all five Hart factors because we conclude, even viewing the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Johnson, the defendants' conduct did not shock the conscience.\nFields, 652 F.3d at 891.\n\n      Johnson alleges the job assignments shock the conscience because Robert and\nBerget were given too much freedom of movement and freedom from supervision.\nWe disagree. Berget had worked as an orderly for many years without creating a\nknown threat of harm to any correctional officer. The defendants were not indifferent\nto any alleged threat because no reported threat carried enough specificity for this\nCourt to determine the penitentiary staff should have drawn an inference of a\nsubstantial risk of harm. See Moore, 381 F.3d at 774. Despite the histories of Berget\nand Johnson, the defendants were not deliberately indifferent in allowing Berget and\nRobert to hold these prison jobs.\n\n       Johnson alleges moving Berget to a medium security housing area shocks the\nconscience, particularly in light of missing paperwork and alleged hunger strike deals.\nJohnson maintains Berget had no right to be placed outside the maximum unit based\non his criminal history, escape history, and institutional conduct. This is correct;\nBerget would have no viable challenge to a maximum security placement. See Burns\nv. Swenson, 430 F.2d 771 (8th Cir. 1970). However, moving Berget to a medium\nsecurity area, although not required, does not shock the conscience, particularly in\nlight of DOC policy allowing Warden discretion in housing assignments.\n\n      Although Berget had a substantial history of escaping and escape attempts and\nRobert had attempted to escape, and although both committed violent crimes before\nincarceration, neither Robert nor Berget had committed a murder and neither Robert\nnor Berget had committed a violent act in prison or shown any propensity for prison\n\n                                         -8-\n\fviolence. Johnson argues Robert and Berget were extremely dangerous inmates. In\nretrospect that allegation is certainly true. The murder perpetrated on Ronald Johnson\nshocks the conscience of this Court; however, the record does not demonstrate it was\ndeliberate indifference to not consider Robert and Berget extremely dangerous before\nthe murder of Ronald Johnson. We need not decide whether allowing an extremely\ndangerous inmate to reside in general population with the opportunity to murder\nshocks the conscience, because the histories of Robert and Berget do not support\ndeliberate indifference in failing to consider them highly dangerous. Even with vague\nnotice of a planned escape attempt, the defendants were not deliberately indifferent\nin failing to place Robert and Berget in maximum security. No prior escape attempts\nincluded violence and none had been successful after 1987.\n\n      South Dakota Codified Laws § 24-2-27 contemplates the DOC will have\ncontrol of housing and classification of inmates. DOC policy contemplates the same,\nand, despite a policy of basing housing on classification, allows Warden discretion.\nAlthough the paperwork was not always completed for the discretionary housing\ndecisions, it was within the Warden’s power to move Robert and Berget from the\nmaximum security facility to the West Hall. We do not find the DOC’s policies on\nWarden discretion to shock the conscience and we do not find the Warden acted with\ndeliberate indifference in his transfers of Robert and Berget.\n\n                                         III\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",

The only evidence Johnson presents indicating the\nDOC may have known of a murder and escape plot comes from a media interview\ngiven immediately after the murder by Jesse Sondreal, the state's attorney who had\nprosecuted Robert and Berget. Sondreal testified he told the media he previously\nlearned about a murder and escape plan. Sondreal's deposition testimony made clear\nthe information did not originate from any of the defendants, but rather came from the\nDepartment of Criminal Investigation. Sondreal could not identify any details of the\nalleged escape and murder plot, but understood the threat to a guard was related to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fRobert's 2007 escape attempt.2 No other witnesses corroborate the information\nSondreal provided to the media and Sondreal could produce no notes or e-mails to\nshow exactly what he learned and from whom.\n\n       Berget and Robert ultimately ended up residing near each other in West Hall.\nAt the time of the murder, Robert held the job of laundry cart pusher, requiring\nRobert to push a cart to and from the laundry building, which was separate from West\nHall. Berget held various orderly jobs during his incarceration and was a trash-\nrecycling orderly at the time of the murder. The jobs held by Robert and Berget did\nnot require direct correctional supervision at all times. Taking advantage of the\nrelative freedoms offered by their jobs, on April 12, 2011, Robert and Berget left\nWest Hall and proceeded to an unauthorized area of the penitentiary where they\nmurdered Ronald Johnson and attempted to escape from the penitentiary. The escape\nattempt was unsuccessful and Robert and Berget were convicted of murder.\n\n       Johnson thereafter commenced this suit in South Dakota state court. Johnson\nnamed as defendants the State of South Dakota; the South Dakota Department of\nCorrections; Douglas Weber, the then-warden at the South Dakota State Penitentiary;\nTroy Ponto, as associate warden; Darin Young, a former associate warden and current\nWarden at the penitentiary; Crystal Van Vooren, a major who has worked for the\nDOC since 1989; Dennis Kaemingk, the Secretary of the DOC whose appointment\nbecame effective on May 2, 2011; Laurie Feiler, the Deputy Secretary of Corrections;\nTimothy A. Reisch, the former Secretary of Corrections until becoming Adjutant\nGeneral for South Dakota on April 2, 2011; and twenty John Does. Johnson brought\na federal constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and five state law claims,\nalleging defendants were constitutionally liable for the murder of Robert Johnson\nbecause Robert and Berget had violent criminal pasts, escape histories, were\n\n\n      2\n       Johnson does not argue Robert's 2007 escape attempt included a plan to\nmurder a prison guard, and no evidence in the record supports such a claim.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fmaximum-security inmates housed in the wrong area, made deals with the Warden,\ndid not have proper classification paperwork, and had too much freedom of\nmovement in their jobs. The defendants removed the action to federal court.\n\n      The district court found defendants entitled to qualified immunity and granted\nsummary judgment on Johnson’s constitutional claims. The district court remanded\nthe remaining state law claims. Johnson appeals.\n\n                                           II\n\n       \"We review a district court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment\nde novo, applying the same standards for summary judgment as the district court.\"\nTusing v.

The deliberate\nindifference standard applied in a substantive due process case is the same as that\napplied in Eighth Amendment cases: \"the official must both be aware of facts from\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and\nhe must also draw the inference.\" Moore, 381 F.3d at 773-74 (citing Farmer v.\nBrennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (1994)).\n\n       On appeal, Johnson argues the district court erred in its analysis of the Hart\nfactors and argues the actions of the defendants shock the conscience. First, Johnson\nalleges the district court erred in taking into account only the most recent housing and\njob assignments in its analysis in light of the temporal requirement of the second Hart\n\n                                          -7-\n\ffactor. We need not determine exactly how \"immediate\" a harm must occur under\nHart, because even considering housing decisions as early as 2004 there is no\nevidence of deliberate indifference or conscious-shocking conduct. We need not\nanalyze all five Hart factors because we conclude, even viewing the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Johnson, the defendants' conduct did not shock the conscience.\nFields, 652 F.3d at 891.\n\n      Johnson alleges the job assignments shock the conscience because Robert and\nBerget were given too much freedom of movement and freedom from supervision.\nWe disagree. Berget had worked as an orderly for many years without creating a\nknown threat of harm to any correctional officer. The defendants were not indifferent\nto any alleged threat because no reported threat carried enough specificity for this\nCourt to determine the penitentiary staff should have drawn an inference of a\nsubstantial risk of harm. See Moore, 381 F.3d at 774. Despite the histories of Berget\nand Johnson, the defendants were not deliberately indifferent in allowing Berget and\nRobert to hold these prison jobs.\n\n       Johnson alleges moving Berget to a medium security housing area shocks the\nconscience, particularly in light of missing paperwork and alleged hunger strike deals.\nJohnson maintains Berget had no right to be placed outside the maximum unit based\non his criminal history, escape history, and institutional conduct. This is correct;\nBerget would have no viable challenge to a maximum security placement. See Burns\nv. Swenson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291674\"><a href=\"/opinion/291674/robert-e-burns-v-h-r-swenson-warden-of-the-missouri-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1970). However, moving Berget to a medium\nsecurity area, although not required, does not shock the conscience, particularly in\nlight of DOC policy allowing Warden discretion in housing assignments.\n\n      Although Berget had a substantial history of escaping and escape attempts and\nRobert had attempted to escape, and although both committed violent crimes before\nincarceration, neither Robert nor Berget had committed a murder and neither Robert\nnor Berget had committed a violent act in prison or shown any propensity for prison\n\n                                         -8-\n\fviolence. Johnson argues Robert and Berget were extremely dangerous inmates. In\nretrospect that allegation is certainly true. The murder perpetrated on Ronald Johnson\nshocks the conscience of this Court; however, the record does not demonstrate it was\ndeliberate indifference to not consider Robert and Berget extremely dangerous before\nthe murder of Ronald Johnson. We need not decide whether allowing an extremely\ndangerous inmate to reside in general population with the opportunity to murder\nshocks the conscience, because the histories of Robert and Berget do not support\ndeliberate indifference in failing to consider them highly dangerous. Even with vague\nnotice of a planned escape attempt, the defendants were not deliberately indifferent\nin failing to place Robert and Berget in maximum security. No prior escape attempts\nincluded violence and none had been successful after 1987.\n\n      South Dakota Codified Laws § 24-2-27 contemplates the DOC will have\ncontrol of housing and classification of inmates. DOC policy contemplates the same,\nand, despite a policy of basing housing on classification, allows Warden discretion.\nAlthough the paperwork was not always completed for the discretionary housing\ndecisions, it was within the Warden’s power to move Robert and Berget from the\nmaximum security facility to the West Hall. We do not find the DOC’s policies on\nWarden discretion to shock the conscience and we do not find the Warden acted with\ndeliberate indifference in his transfers of Robert and Berget.\n\n                                         III\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f</pre>",
