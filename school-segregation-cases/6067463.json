A jury convicted\n\nUlbricht of drug trafficking and other crimes associated with his creation and\n\n                                         2\n\foperation of Silk Road, an online marketplace whose users primarily purchased\n\nand sold illegal goods and services.

Because\n\nwe identify no reversible error, we AFFIRM Ulbricht’s conviction and sentence in\n\nall respects.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n       In February 2015, a jury convicted Ross William Ulbricht on seven counts\n\narising from his creation and operation of Silk Road under the username Dread\n\nPirate Roberts (“DPR”).1 Silk Road was a massive, anonymous criminal\n\n1\n The seven crimes of conviction were: (1) distribution and aiding and abetting\ndistribution of narcotics, 21 U.S.C. § 812, § 841(a)(1), § 841(b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2; (2) using the Internet to distribute narcotics, 21 U.S.C. § 812, § 841(h) and\n§ 841(b)(1)(A); (3) conspiracy to distribute narcotics, 21 U.S.C. § 846; (4) engaging\nin a continuing criminal enterprise, 21 U.S.C. § 848(a); (5) conspiring to obtain\nunauthorized access to a computer for purposes of commercial advantage and\nprivate financial gain and in furtherance of other criminal and tortious acts, 18\nU.S.C. § 1030(a)(2) and § 1030(b); (6) conspiring to traffic in fraudulent\nidentification documents, 18 U.S.C. § 1028(f); and (7) conspiring to launder\nmoney, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).\n\n                                           3\n\fmarketplace that operated using the Tor Network, which renders Internet traffic\n\nthrough the Tor browser extremely difficult to trace.2 Silk Road users principally\n\nbought and sold drugs, false identification documents, and computer hacking\n\nsoftware. Transactions on Silk Road exclusively used Bitcoins, an anonymous but\n\ntraceable digital currency.3 The site also contained a private message system,\n\nwhich allowed users to send messages to each other (similar to communicating\n\nvia email), a public forum to discuss topics related to Silk Road, and a “wiki,”\n\nwhich is like an encyclopedia that users could access to receive advice about\n\nusing the site. Silk Road customers and vendors could also access a support\n\n\n\n2\n Tor is short for the “The Onion Router.” The Tor Network is “a special network\non the Internet designed to make it practically impossible to physically locate the\ncomputers hosting or accessing websites on the network.” App’x 53. The Tor\nNetwork can be accessed via the Tor browser using software that anyone may\nobtain for free on the Internet.\n3\n Bitcoins allow vendors and customers to maintain their anonymity in the same\nway that cash does, by transferring Bitcoins between anonymous Bitcoin\naccounts, which do not contain any identifying information about the user of\neach account. The currency is “traceable” in that the transaction history of each\nindividual Bitcoin is logged in what is called the blockchain. The blockchain\nprevents a person from spending the same Bitcoin twice, allowing Bitcoin to\noperate similarly to a traditional form of currency. Bitcoin is also a completely\ndecentralized currency, operating free of nation states or central banks; anyone\nwho downloads the Bitcoin software becomes part of the Bitcoin network. The\nblockchain is stored on that network, and the blockchain automatically “self-\nupdates” when a Bitcoin transaction takes place. Tr. 160.\n\n                                         4\n\fsection of the website to seek help from the marketplace’s administrators when\n\nan issue arose.\n\n      According to the government, between 2011 and 2013, thousands of\n\nvendors used Silk Road to sell approximately $183 million worth of illegal drugs,\n\nas well as other goods and services. Ulbricht, acting as DPR, earned millions of\n\ndollars in profits from the commissions collected by Silk Road on purchases. In\n\nOctober 2013, the government arrested Ulbricht, seized the Silk Road servers,\n\nand shut down the site.\n\nI.    Silk Road Investigation\n\n      After Ulbricht created Silk Road in 2011, the site attracted the interest of at\n\nleast two separate divisions of the Department of Justice:4 the United States\n\nAttorney’s Offices for the District of Maryland and for the Southern District of\n\nNew York. Throughout the investigations, law enforcement agents knew that the\n\nperson using Dread Pirate Roberts as his or her Silk Road username had created\n\nand managed the site, but they did not know DPR’s actual identity. In 2012 and\n\n2013, agents from both offices investigated several individuals who the\n\n\n4\n The government first learned of Silk Road and began investigating it in 2011\nafter international packages containing drugs were intercepted at Chicago’s\nO’Hare airport.\n\n                                          5\n\fgovernment suspected were operating Silk Road as DPR. Those individuals\n\nincluded Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, the New\n\nYork office identified Ulbricht as DPR, but the Maryland office had investigated\n\nand later abandoned the theory that either Athavale or Karpeles might have been\n\nDread Pirate Roberts.\n\n      Two aspects of the pre-arrest investigation into Ulbricht are particularly\n\nrelevant to this appeal: (1) the pen/trap orders that the government obtained to\n\nmonitor Internet Protocol (“IP”) address traffic to and from various devices\n\nassociated with Ulbricht; and (2) the corrupt behavior of two Baltimore agents\n\nwho worked on the Silk Road investigation.\n\n      A. The Pen/Trap Orders\n\n      In September 2013, after Ulbricht became a primary suspect in the DPR\n\ninvestigation, the government obtained five “pen/trap” orders. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3121-27 (“Pen/Trap Act”). The orders authorized law enforcement agents to\n\ncollect IP address data for Internet traffic to and from Ulbricht’s home wireless\n\nrouter and other devices that regularly connected to Ulbricht’s home router.\n\nAccording to the government’s applications for the pen register and trap and\n\ntrace device, “[e]very device on the Internet is identified by a unique number”\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fcalled an IP address. S.A. 73.5 “This number is used to route information between\n\ndevices, for example, between two computers.” Id. at 73-74. In other words, an\n\n“IP address is analogous to a telephone number” because “it indicates the online\n\nidentity of the communicating device without revealing the communication’s\n\ncontent.” Id. at 74. Ulbricht does not dispute that description of how IP addresses\n\nfunction.\n\n      The pen/trap orders thus did not permit the government to access the\n\ncontent of Ulbricht’s communications, nor did the government “seek to obtain[]\n\nthe contents of any communications.” Id. at 75. According to Ulbricht, the\n\ngovernment’s use of his home Internet routing data violated the Fourth\n\nAmendment because it helped the government match Ulbricht’s online activity\n\nwith DPR’s use of Silk Road. Ulbricht argues that he has a constitutional privacy\n\ninterest in IP address traffic to and from his home and that the government\n\nobtained the pen/trap orders without a warrant, which would have required\n\nprobable cause.\n\n      B. Corrupt Agents Force and Bridges\n\n      One of the many other tactics that the government used to expose DPR’s\n\n5\n S.A. refers to the joint sealed appendix in this case. Portions of the sealed\nappendix quoted in this opinion are to that extent unsealed.\n\n                                          7\n\fidentity was to find low-level Silk Road administrators who helped DPR\n\nmaintain the site, obtain their cooperation, take over their Silk Road usernames,\n\nand chat with DPR under those identities. The true owners of the administrator\n\naccounts would assist in the investigation by helping the government chat with\n\nDPR and access various aspects of the site. Government agents would also create\n\ntheir own new usernames and pose as drug dealers or buyers to purchase or sell\n\nnarcotics and occasionally contact DPR directly. One of the government’s\n\nprincipal trial witnesses, Special Agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, used the former\n\ntechnique to chat with DPR under the name Cirrus. Cirrus had been a member of\n\nthe Silk Road support staff before the government took over his account, and\n\nDer-Yeghiayan frequently used Silk Road’s messaging system to communicate\n\nwith DPR and other administrators as Cirrus. Cirrus also gave the government\n\naccess to the staff chat, a separate program allowing DPR to communicate only\n\nwith his employees.\n\n      Two undercover agents involved in the Silk Road investigation are of\n\nparticular import to this appeal: Secret Service Special Agent Shaun Bridges and\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) Special Agent Carl Force, both of\n\nwhom were assigned to the Baltimore investigation. Both Force and Bridges used\n\n\n                                         8\n\ftheir undercover access to exploit the site for their own benefit in various ways,\n\nand they eventually pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with their\n\nwork on the Silk Road investigation.6\n\n      For example, Force and Bridges took over an administrator account\n\nbelonging to Curtis Green, who worked for Silk Road under the name Flush.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint against Force and Bridges, in January 2013,\n\nBridges used the Flush username to change other users’ passwords, empty their\n\nBitcoin wallets,7 and keep $350,000 in Bitcoins in offshore bank accounts, all while\n\nattempting to hide his activity through a series of transactions.8 Specifically, the\n\n\n6\n  Both Force and Bridges pleaded guilty to money laundering and obstruction of\njustice; Force also pleaded guilty to extortion. Force was sentenced to 78 months\nin prison, and Bridges received a 71-month sentence.\n7\n  According to the criminal complaint against Ulbricht, a Bitcoin wallet is a\nstorage method for Bitcoins. The wallet is associated with a Bitcoin address,\nwhich is “analogous to the account number for a bank account, while the ‘wallet’\nis analogous to a bank safe where the money in the account is physically stored.”\nApp’x 59. Users can transact in Bitcoin by transferring Bitcoins from one “Bitcoin\naddress to the Bitcoin address of another user, over the Internet.” Id. Ulbricht\ndoes not dispute that definition.\n8\n As described below, the government disclosed shortly before trial that Force\nwas under investigation for Silk Road corruption, but said nothing about Bridges.\nSpecifically, the pretrial disclosure noted that Force was under investigation for\nusing the Flush account to steal $350,000, but the criminal complaint against the\nagents alleges that Bridges committed that particular theft. According to the\ngovernment, both Force and Bridges had access to the Flush account, which\n\n                                          9\n\fcomplaint against Force and Bridges alleges that Bridges “act[ed] as an\n\nadministrator to reset pins and passwords on various Silk Road vendors’\n\naccounts,” then exchanged the Bitcoins for U.S. dollars using the Mt. Gox\n\nexchanger.9 Supp. App’x 180. Shortly after he committed the January 2013 thefts,\n\nBridges asked Force to chat with DPR as Nob, Force’s authorized undercover\n\nusername, to get advice about how to liquidate Bitcoins. He also sought Force’s\n\nhelp in convincing Curtis Green (formerly Flush) to help him transfer Bitcoins to\n\nother accounts, and he ultimately tried to blame Green for the theft.\n\n        With the government’s approval, Force also posed as a drug dealer and\n\ncommunicated with DPR as Nob. As part of his official undercover work as Nob,\n\nForce agreed to sell fraudulent identification documents to DPR for $40,000 in\n\nBitcoins. According to the criminal complaint against the agents, Force kept the\n\nBitcoins received by his Nob account in connection with that transaction for his\n\npersonal use. On another occasion, again as part of his authorized undercover\n\nwork, Force advised DPR that he had access to information about Silk Road from\n\nan invented corrupt government employee. DPR paid Force $50,000 in Bitcoins\n\n\n\nmight explain their initial suspicion that Force stole the funds.\n9\n    Mt. Gox was a prominent Bitcoin exchanger owned by Mark Karpeles.\n\n                                         10\n\ffor purported inside law enforcement information; Force allegedly purloined that\n\npayment as well. Moreover, outside his authorized undercover work, Force\n\noperated another account under the name French Maid, through which he again\n\noffered to sell DPR information about the government’s Silk Road investigation.\n\nActing as French Maid, Force received about $100,000 in Bitcoins that he kept for\n\nhis personal use.\n\n      Force created yet another unauthorized Silk Road account, under the name\n\nDeathFromAbove, which was unknown to law enforcement until the defense\n\nidentified it during trial. Force used the DeathFromAbove account to try to extort\n\nmoney from DPR. For example, in one such chat that took place on April 16,\n\n2013, DeathFromAbove told DPR that he knew that DPR’s true identity was\n\nAnand Athavale. DeathFromAbove demanded a payment of $250,000 in\n\nexchange for which DeathFromAbove would remain silent about DPR’s\n\nidentity.10 There is no evidence that DPR made the requested payment to\n\nDeathFromAbove; indeed, DPR shrugged off the attempted blackmail as\n\n\n10\n  DeathFromAbove also referred to the $250,000 payment he demanded as\n“punitive damages.” App’x 875. In the government’s view, the “punitive\ndamages” remark referenced the murder of a Silk Road administrator that\nUlbricht ordered and paid for (but that was never carried out). That and other\nkillings that DPR commissioned will be described in more detail below.\n\n                                        11\n\f“bogus.”App’x 710.\n\n      As will be explained in more detail below, the district court prevented\n\nUlbricht from introducing evidence at trial related to Force’s corruption because\n\ndoing so would have exposed the ongoing grand jury investigation into Force’s\n\nconduct. The district court also denied Ulbricht discovery related to the\n\ninvestigation and excluded certain hearsay statements that arguably revealed\n\nForce’s corruption. Ulbricht contends on appeal that the district court’s various\n\nrulings concerning evidence related to Force deprived him of a fair trial.\n\nAdditionally, Ulbricht did not learn of Bridges’s corrupt conduct until after trial\n\nwhen the criminal complaint against both agents was unsealed. Thus, in his\n\nmotion for a new trial, he argued that the belated disclosure violated his due\n\nprocess rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Ulbricht contends on\n\nappeal that the district court incorrectly denied that motion.\n\nII.   Ulbricht’s Arrest\n\n      Ulbricht was arrested in a San Francisco public library on October 1, 2013,\n\nafter the government had amassed significant evidence identifying him as Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. The arrest was successfully orchestrated to catch Ulbricht in the\n\nact of administering Silk Road as DPR. Federal agents observed Ulbricht enter\n\n\n                                         12\n\fthe public library, and a few minutes later Dread Pirate Roberts came online in\n\nthe Silk Road staff chat. Der-Yeghiayan, under the undercover administrator\n\nusername Cirrus, initiated a chat with DPR, asking him to go to a specific place\n\non the Silk Road site to address some flagged messages from users. Der-\n\nYeghiayan reasoned that this would “force [Ulbricht] to log in under . . . his\n\nDread Pirate Roberts account” in the Silk Road marketplace, as well as in the staff\n\nchat software. Tr. 331-32.\n\n      Once Der-Yeghiayan knew that DPR had logged onto the flagged message\n\npage in the marketplace, he signaled another agent to effect the arrest. Ulbricht\n\nwas arrested, and incident to that arrest agents seized his laptop. The same chat\n\nthat Der-Yeghiayan had initiated with Dread Pirate Roberts a few minutes earlier\n\nwas open on Ulbricht’s screen. Ulbricht also visited the flagged post in the\n\nmarketplace that Der-Yeghiayan (as Cirrus) had asked DPR to look at during\n\ntheir chat. While he was chatting with Cirrus, moreover, Ulbricht had accessed\n\nSilk Road by using the “Mastermind” page. That page was available only to\n\nDread Pirate Roberts.\n\n      A great deal of the evidence against Ulbricht came from the government’s\n\nsearch of his laptop and his home after the arrest. On the day of Ulbricht’s arrest,\n\n\n                                         13\n\fthe government obtained a warrant to seize Ulbricht’s laptop and search it for a\n\nwide variety of information related to Silk Road and information that would\n\nidentify Ulbricht as Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht moved to suppress the large\n\nquantity of evidence obtained from his laptop, challenging the constitutionality\n\nof that search warrant. Ulbricht argues on appeal that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress. More details concerning the search warrant will\n\nbe described in context below.\n\nIII.   The Trial\n\n       Ulbricht’s trial lasted approximately three weeks, from January 13 through\n\nFebruary 4, 2015. Judge Forrest handled the complex and contentious trial with\n\ncommendable patience and skill. Although Ulbricht does not challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s verdict on any of the counts of\n\nconviction, we summarize the evidence presented at trial as context for the issues\n\nraised on appeal.\n\n       A. The Government’s Case\n\n       The government presented overwhelming evidence that Ulbricht created\n\nSilk Road in 2011 and continued to operate the site throughout its lifetime by\n\nmaintaining its computer infrastructure, interacting with vendors, crafting\n\n\n                                         14\n\fpolicies for site users, deciding what products would be available for sale on the\n\nsite, and managing a small staff of administrators and software engineers.\n\nDefense counsel conceded in his opening statement that Ulbricht did in fact\n\ncreate Silk Road.\n\n      According to Ulbricht’s own words in a 2009 email, Ulbricht originally\n\nconceived of Silk Road as “an online storefront that couldn’t be traced back to\n\n[him] . . . where [his] customers could buy [his] products” and pay for them\n\n“anonymously and securely.” Tr. 991. From 2009 through 2011, Ulbricht worked\n\nto get the site up and running, relying on computer programming assistance\n\nfrom others, including his friend Richard Bates. According to one of the journal\n\nentries discovered on his laptop, in 2010 Ulbricht began to grow hallucinogenic\n\nmushrooms to sell on the site “for cheap to get people interested.” Tr. 899. As the\n\nsite began to garner significant interest in 2011, Ulbricht wrote in his journal that\n\nhe was “creating a year of prosperity and power beyond what I have ever\n\nexperienced before. Silk Road is going to become a phenomenon and at least one\n\nperson will tell me about it, unknowing that I was its creator.” Tr. 899-900.\n\n             1. Evidence Linking Ulbricht to Dread Pirate Roberts\n\n      Around January 2012, the Silk Road user who represented himself as the\n\n\n                                          15\n\flead administrator of the site adopted the username Dread Pirate Roberts.11 The\n\nname alludes to the pseudonym of a pirate in the popular novel and film The\n\nPrincess Bride that is periodically passed on from one individual to another.12 In\n\norder to assure users that posts purporting to be authored by DPR were indeed\n\nhis own, DPR authenticated his posts using an electronic signature known as a\n\nPGP key.13 Silk Road users had access to a public PGP key, and DPR had a\n\nprivate PGP key that he alone could use to sign his Silk Road posts. When DPR\n\nsigned a post using his private key, Silk Road users could run the code in the\n\npublic key, and if the post was signed with the correct private key the user would\n\nreceive a message that the authentication was successful. The government\n\nrecovered DPR’s private PGP key on Ulbricht’s laptop. Importantly, the public\n\nPGP key did not change during the site’s life span, meaning that DPR used the\n\nsame private key to sign his posts throughout the time that he administered Silk\n\nRoad.\n\n11\n  The timing of this change corresponds to a January 15, 2012 Tor chat between a\nuser named “vj” and Ulbricht, in which vj advised Ulbricht to change his\nusername from Admin to Dread Pirate Roberts.\n12\n  See William Goldman, The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern’s Classic Tale of True\nLove and High Adventure (1973); The Princess Bride (20th Century Fox 1987).\n13\n     PGP stands for “Pretty Good Privacy.”\n\n                                         16\n\f      Additional evidence supported the conclusion that Ulbricht was Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. For example, the instructions that DPR provided to Cirrus (the\n\naccount that Der-Yeghiayan later used for undercover work) for how to access\n\nthe staff chat and contact DPR directly were found in a file on Ulbricht’s laptop.\n\nThe government also discovered the following evidence, covering the entire\n\nperiod during which DPR managed the Silk Road site, on Ulbricht’s computer:\n\nthousands of pages of chat logs with Silk Road employees; detailed journal\n\nentries describing Ulbricht’s ownership of the site; a list that tracked Ulbricht’s\n\ntasks and ideas related to Silk Road; a copy of Silk Road’s database; and\n\nspreadsheets cataloguing both the servers that hosted Silk Road and expenses\n\nand profits associated with the site. The government seized approximately $18\n\nmillion worth of Bitcoins from the wallet on Ulbricht’s laptop and analyzed their\n\ntransaction history (through blockchain records) to determine that about 89% of\n\nthe Bitcoins on Ulbricht’s computer came from Silk Road servers located in\n\nIceland.\n\n      A search of Ulbricht’s home yielded additional evidence linking him with\n\nthe site. That evidence included two USB hard drives with versions of documents\n\nrelated to Silk Road that were also stored on Ulbricht’s laptop. There were also\n\n\n                                          17\n\fhandwritten notes crumpled in Ulbricht’s bedroom trash can about ideas for\n\nimproving Silk Road’s vendor rating system—an initiative that Dread Pirate\n\nRoberts had just revealed through a post in a discussion forum on the site.\n\n      The government also introduced other circumstantial evidence connecting\n\nUlbricht to DPR’s activity on Silk Road, such as evidence matching Ulbricht’s\n\nactual travel history with DPR’s online discussion of his travel plans. As one\n\nconcrete example, the government discovered a Tor Chat log14 on Ulbricht’s\n\nlaptop memorializing DPR’s chat with a user named H7. On October 30, 2011,\n\nDPR told H7 that he would be traveling soon. On Ulbricht’s Gmail account,\n\nwhich uses an email address that incorporates his full name, the government\n\ndiscovered a travel itinerary from CheapAir that indicated that Ulbricht would\n\nbe traveling on November 15, 2011.\n\n      The government introduced several additional examples of DPR\n\ndiscussing travel plans that matched up with travel disclosed in Ulbricht’s email\n\nand social media activity. At one point, for example, Ulbricht uploaded photos to\n\nhis Facebook account in an album entitled “Thailand, February 2012.” DPR\n\n\n\n14\n  Tor Chat is a program that allows “communication between people on the Tor\nnetwork.” Tr. 889.\n\n                                        18\n\fdiscussed going to Thailand in a Tor chat on January 27, 2012, indicating that he\n\nwas in “Thailand now,” attracted by the “allure of a warm beach.” Tr. 1300. He\n\nalso mentioned in a January 26 chat with a user named “vj,” which stood for\n\nVariety Jones, that he was in Thailand to experience the “beaches and jungles.”\n\nId. at 1298. One of the photos in the Thailand Facebook album depicted Ulbricht\n\n“in front of what appears to be jungles and beaches,” both of which were\n\nreferenced in DPR’s chats from late January. Id. at 1301.\n\n             2. Murders Commissioned by Dread Pirate Roberts\n\n      The government also presented evidence that DPR commissioned the\n\nmurders of five people to protect Silk Road’s anonymity, although there is no\n\nevidence that any of the murders actually occurred.15 In March 2013, a Silk Road\n\n\n15\n  Ulbricht was not charged in this case with crimes based on ordering these\nkillings, although evidence relating to the murders was introduced at trial as\nactions taken in furtherance of the charged conspiracies and criminal enterprise.\nThe killings were referenced again in connection with Ulbricht’s sentencing. He\nfaces open attempted murder-for-hire charges in the District of Maryland,\nhowever. United States v. Ulbricht, No. 13-0222-CCB (D. Md.). That indictment\ncharges Ulbricht with the attempted murder of Curtis Green (Flush). According\nto the criminal complaint against the corrupt officers, after Bridges, using Flush’s\naccount, stole $350,000 in Bitcoin in January 2013, DPR recruited Nob (Force) to\nkill Flush as punishment for the theft. DPR paid Nob $80,000 to carry out the\nmurder, which Force faked to make Ulbricht believe that the task was complete.\nPresumably because the government removed from its trial evidence anything\nthat the corrupted agent Force may have touched, it did not present evidence of\n\n                                         19\n\fvendor whose username was FriendlyChemist threatened to release “thousands\n\nof usernames, ordr [sic] amounts, [and] addresses” of Silk Road customers and\n\nvendors if DPR did not ensure that FriendlyChemist received money from\n\nanother person, Lucydrop. Tr. 1806. Releasing the information would have\n\ndestroyed the affected users’ anonymity, undermining the security of the site. In\n\na later chat with another person, RealLucyDrop, DPR wrote that it would be\n\n“terrible” if the personal information were to be released, and thus he needed\n\nFriendlyChemist’s “real world identity so I can threaten him with violence if he\n\nwere to release any names.” Id. at 1811.\n\n      The episode escalated from there. DPR connected with Redandwhite, who\n\nwas FriendlyChemist’s supplier, and wrote that “FriendlyChemist is a liability\n\nand I wouldn’t mind if he was executed.” Id. at 1822. After negotiating the\n\nlogistical details of the murder, Ulbricht agreed to pay Redandwhite $150,000 in\n\nBitcoins to kill FriendlyChemist. DPR paid Redandwhite, who later confirmed\n\nthat he had received the payment and carried out the murder, and sent what\n\nappeared to be a photo of the dead victim to DPR. DPR replied that he had\n\n\n\n\nthe Flush murder-for-hire agreement, nor did it rely on that murder at\nsentencing.\n\n                                           20\n\f“received the picture and deleted it,” and thanked Redandwhite for his “swift\n\naction.” Id. at 1892. Around the same time, Ulbricht recorded in a file on his\n\nlaptop that he “[g]ot word that the blackmailer was executed.” Id. at 1887. The\n\ngovernment was not able to develop any evidence linking these conversations to\n\nan actual murder. A reasonable jury could easily conclude, however, that the\n\nevidence demonstrated that Ulbricht ordered and paid for the killing, and that he\n\nbelieved that it had occurred.\n\n      Later, DPR ordered four other murders through Redandwhite. Dread\n\nPirate Roberts identified another Silk Road user, Tony76, who knew\n\nFriendlyChemist and might compromise the site’s anonymity. After some\n\nnegotiations, DPR agreed to pay Redandwhite $500,000 in Bitcoins to kill Tony76\n\nand three of his associates. DPR then sent the payment to Redandwhite. On April\n\n6, 2013, Ulbricht wrote in a file on his laptop that he “[g]ave angels go ahead to\n\nfind tony76.” Tr. 1900. Two days later, Ulbricht recorded that he “[s]ent payment\n\nto angels for hit on tony76 and his three associates.” Id. One of the government’s\n\nexpert witnesses was able to link the payments for all five murders to Bitcoin\n\nwallets located on Ulbricht’s laptop. Again, while the evidence demonstrates that\n\nUlbricht ordered and paid substantial sums for the murders, there is no evidence\n\n\n                                         21\n\fthat the killings actually took place; the government theorized that Redandwhite\n\nhad tricked Ulbricht into thinking that he actually committed the murders, but\n\nthat in fact he had not.\n\n      B. The Defense Case\n\n      As noted above, Ulbricht conceded at trial that he had created Silk Road,\n\nand he was caught red-handed operating the site at the end of the investigation.\n\nHis principal defense strategy at trial—more of an effort at mitigation than\n\noutright denial of his guilt of the conspiracy and other charges in the\n\nindictment—was to admit his role at the beginning and end of the site’s\n\noperation, but to contend that he sold Silk Road to someone else in 2011 and\n\nabandoned his role as its administrator, only to be lured back by the successor\n\nDPR near the end of its operation to take the blame for operating the site. The\n\ndefense attempted on several occasions to implicate as alternative suspects\n\nKarpeles and Athavale, both of whom the government had investigated for a\n\npossible connection to Silk Road but later abandoned as candidates for DPR’s\n\nreal-world identity. As part of his alternative-perpetrator defense, Ulbricht\n\ntheorized that the person or persons who operated as the true Dread Pirate\n\nRoberts during the purported interim period planted incriminating evidence on\n\n\n                                         22\n\fhis laptop in order to frame him. For the most part, the defense advanced this\n\ntheory through cross-examination of government witnesses. Ulbricht did not\n\ntestify at trial.\n\n       One point in the testimony of Richard Bates exemplifies the defense’s\n\napproach and the government’s response. Bates, Ulbricht’s friend who assisted\n\nwith computer programming issues when Ulbricht launched Silk Road, testified\n\nfor the government. According to Bates, Ulbricht told him in November 2011 that\n\nhe had sold Silk Road to someone else, a claim that Bates believed at the time to\n\nbe true. Moreover, in a February 2013 Google chat between Bates and Ulbricht,\n\nUlbricht wrote that he was “[g]lad” that Silk Road was “not [his] problem\n\nanymore.” Tr. 1140-41.16 Bates understood that to mean that Ulbricht no longer\n\nworked on the site.\n\n       To mitigate any damage from Bates’s testimony, the government\n\nintroduced a December 9, 2011 Tor chat between Ulbricht and vj. In that chat, vj\n\nasked Ulbricht whether anyone else knew about his involvement in Silk Road.\n\n\n\n16\n  There are two versions of the trial transcript for January 22, 2015 on the district\ncourt docket. The page citations here refer to the version of the transcript marked\n“corrected,” which is listed on the district court docket as Document No. 208 (14-\ncr-68).\n\n                                         23\n\fUlbricht responded: “[U]nfortunately yes. There are two, but they think I sold the\n\nsite and got out and they are quite convinced of it.” Tr. 1191. He further wrote\n\nthat those two people thought he sold the site “about a month ago,” id., which\n\nroughly corresponds to the November 2011 conversation between Bates and\n\nUlbricht. Significantly, it was shortly after this conversation that vj suggested that\n\nUlbricht change his online identity to DPR. In view of the fictional character it\n\nreferenced, the government contended that the online moniker DPR was\n\ndeliberately adopted to support the cover story that the lead administrator of Silk\n\nRoad changed over time.\n\n      Thus, although the government elicited testimony that Ulbricht told Bates\n\nthat he sold the site in 2011, it also presented evidence that Ulbricht had lied to\n\nBates about that sale and continued to operate the site in secret.\n\n             1. Cross-Examination of Government Witnesses\n\n      Ulbricht’s defense depended heavily on cross-examination of government\n\nwitnesses, much of which was designed to support the argument that either\n\nKarpeles or Athavale was the real DPR, or that multiple people operated as\n\nDread Pirate Roberts during Silk Road’s life span. The district court limited his\n\ncross-examination in two ways that Ulbricht challenges on appeal. First, the\n\n\n                                          24\n\fdistrict court prevented Ulbricht from exploring several specific topics with Der-\n\nYeghiayan, the government’s first witness, through whom it introduced much of\n\nits evidence. Those topics included, inter alia, Der-Yeghiayan’s prior suspicions\n\nthat Karpeles was DPR. Second, the district court limited Ulbricht’s ability to\n\ncross examine FBI computer scientist Thomas Kiernan, who testified about\n\nevidence that he discovered on Ulbricht’s laptop, concerning several specific\n\ntechnical issues related to software on Ulbricht’s computer. More details about\n\nthose attempted cross-examinations will be discussed in context below.\n\n            2. Hearsay Statements\n\n      Ulbricht also attempted to introduce two hearsay statements in his defense,\n\nboth of which the district court excluded as inadmissible. Those hearsay\n\nstatements comprise: (1) chats between DPR and DeathFromAbove (Force)\n\nconcerning Force’s attempt to extort money from DPR in exchange for\n\ninformation about the government’s investigation of Silk Road; and (2) the\n\ngovernment’s letter describing a statement by Andrew Jones, a site administrator,\n\nconcerning one particular conversation that he had with DPR. The contents of\n\nthose hearsay statements and other relevant facts will be discussed in more detail\n\nbelow.\n\n\n                                         25\n\f             3. Defense Expert Witnesses\n\n      Long after the trial began on January 13, 2015, and shortly before the\n\ngovernment rested on February 2 and the defense rested on February 3, Ulbricht\n\ndisclosed to the government his intent to call two expert witnesses: Dr. Steven\n\nBellovin and Andreas Antonopoulos.17 The Antonopoulos disclosure indicated\n\nthat he would testify on several subjects relevant to Silk Road, including “the\n\norigins of Bitcoin,” “the various purposes and uses of Bitcoin,” “the mechanics of\n\nBitcoin transactions,” “the value of Bitcoin over time since its inception,” and\n\n“the concepts of Bitcoin speculating and Bitcoin mining,” among other things.\n\nApp’x 349. The Bellovin disclosure followed a similar pattern, indicating that he\n\nwould testify about “[g]eneral principles of internet security and vulnerabilities,”\n\nthe “import of some lines of PHP code provided to defense counsel in\n\ndiscovery,” and “[g]eneral principles of public-key cryptography,” among other\n\ntopics. Id. at 360. Neither disclosure summarized the opinions that the experts\n\nwould offer on those subjects, nor did either identify the bases for the experts’\n\nopinions.\n\n\n\n17\n  Ulbricht noticed his intent to call Antonopoulos on January 26 and Bellovin on\nJanuary 30, 2015.\n\n                                         26\n\f      On January 29 and 31, the government moved to preclude the testimony of\n\nboth proffered experts. The government argued that the expert notices were\n\nuntimely and did not contain the information required by Rule 16 of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure, including a summary of the opinions that the\n\nexperts would offer on the stand.18 On February 1—three days before the end of\n\nthe trial—the district court granted the government’s motions and precluded\n\nboth experts from testifying, concluding that the defendant’s notices were late\n\nand that the disclosures were substantively inadequate under Rule 16. Ulbricht\n\nclaims that the district court erred in precluding his experts from testifying.\n\n      In sum, the defense case was limited to cross-examining government\n\nwitnesses, briefly calling four character witnesses, having a defense investigator\n\nauthenticate a task list on Ulbricht’s computer, and reading a few of DPR’s posts\n\ninto the record. Ulbricht contends, however, that his defense was hamstrung by\n\nthe rulings described above.\n\n\n\n\n18\n  The government also argued generally that some of the topics identified in the\ndisclosures were not relevant to Ulbricht’s case or did not require expert\ntestimony.\n\n                                         27\n\f      C. The Verdict and Post-Trial Motion\n\n      After deliberating for about three and a half hours, the jury returned a\n\nguilty verdict on all seven counts in the Indictment. As described in more detail\n\nbelow, Ulbricht then moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, and Ulbricht argues here that it erred in doing\n\nso.\n\nIV.   Sentencing\n\n      The United States Probation Office prepared the Pre-Sentence Investigation\n\nReport (“PSR”) in March 2015. It described the offense conduct in detail and\n\ndiscussed the five murders that Ulbricht allegedly hired Redandwhite to\n\ncommit.19 Over Ulbricht’s objection, the PSR also discussed six drug-related\n\ndeaths that the government contended, and the district court found, were\n\nconnected with Silk Road. Circumstantial evidence linked each of those fatalities\n\nwith varying degrees of certainty to the decedent’s purchase of drugs on Silk\n\nRoad. For example, one user died from an overdose of heroin combined with\n\nother drugs. The deceased individual was found with a needle and a bag of\n\n\n\n19\n  The PSR did not refer to the additional murder of “Flush” that DPR allegedly\npaid Force, under his undercover identity Nob, to commit. See supra note 15.\n\n                                        28\n\fheroin, as well as a torn-open delivery package. Open on his computer was a Silk\n\nRoad chat in which a vendor described the package of heroin that was due to\n\narrive that day, including a tracking number that matched the opened package.\n\n      Two other individuals whose deaths the PSR described were Silk Road\n\ncustomers who purchased drugs on the site shortly before their deaths. A fourth\n\nperson died after ingesting a synthetic drug originally purchased on Silk Road\n\nthat he obtained through an intermediary dealer, and a fifth died after leaping\n\nfrom a balcony while high on a psychedelic drug that he bought from the site. A\n\nsixth person died of pneumonia after placing over thirty orders for heroin and\n\nother drugs on Silk Road; the autopsy report theorized that his drug use may\n\nhave “blunted the deceased’s perception of the severity of his illness,” thus\n\ncontributing to his premature death. PSR ¶ 83. In arguing that the district court\n\nshould consider the six deaths, the government explained that they “illustrate the\n\nobvious: that drugs can cause serious harm, including death.” App’x 902.\n\n      In the first of several sentencing submissions, Ulbricht urged the district\n\ncourt not to consider the six drug-related deaths and to strike them from the PSR.\n\nIn support of that argument, Ulbricht claimed that Silk Road had harm-reducing\n\neffects, meaning that it made drug use less dangerous. Specifically, Ulbricht\n\n\n                                        29\n\femployed Dr. Fernando Caudevilla (username Doctor X), a physician who\n\nprovided drug-use advice to the site’s customers. Caudevilla spent up to two or\n\nthree hours a day on Silk Road discussion fora and sent over 450 messages\n\nproviding guidance about illegal drug dosage and administration, as well as\n\ninformation about the harms associated with certain drugs. Caudevilla also\n\nprovided weekly reports to DPR concerning the advice he gave to the site’s users.\n\nUlbricht further claimed that Silk Road allowed for better drug quality control\n\nbecause vendors were subject to a rating system,20 buyers were able to choose\n\nfrom among many different sellers, and the site’s anonymity encouraged free\n\ndialogue about drug use that helped mitigate the stigma accompanying drug\n\naddiction.21 According to Caudevilla, when the site received negative feedback\n\nabout the quality of the drugs sold by a vendor, that vendor was removed from\n\n\n20\n  As the government pointed out in its sentencing submission, fake vendor\nreviews were commonplace, and vendors sometimes coerced customers into\ngiving them perfect ratings.\n21\n  Ulbricht referenced a study by Tim Bingham, who researched Silk Road users\nbetween September 2012 and August 2013. Bingham interviewed Silk Road\ncustomers and concluded that the site operated as a “novel technological drug\nsubculture, potentially minimiz[ing] drug-related stigma by reinforcing a[] sense\nof community.” App’x 905. Thus, Bingham concluded, and Ulbricht argued, that\nSilk Road encouraged more “responsible forms of recreational drug use.” Id. at\n906.\n\n                                        30\n\fthe site. Finally, Ulbricht claimed that the site reduced violence associated with\n\nthe drug trade by providing a safe, computer-based method of purchasing drugs.\n\n      Ulbricht also submitted an expert report from Dr. Mark Taff, which\n\nprovided an alternative reason for excluding the six deaths from the PSR. In his\n\nreport, Dr. Taff explained that, based on the information available, it was\n\nimpossible to know with medical certainty that Silk Road drugs caused the six\n\ndeaths described in the PSR. There were “gaping holes” in the investigations into\n\neach death, and some were missing autopsy reports, toxicology reports, and\n\ndeath certificates. App’x 911. Moreover, Dr. Taff claimed that it was impossible to\n\nknow the cause of each death because several of the deceased had ingested\n\nmultiple drugs prior to their deaths. Ulbricht argued that, absent a clear causal\n\nlink between the deaths and the offense conduct, the deaths were not relevant to\n\nhis sentencing at all.\n\n      The defense later submitted another sentencing memorandum, which\n\nincluded 97 letters from friends and family describing Ulbricht’s good character\n\nas well as academic articles about the myriad problems associated with unduly\n\nsevere sentences for drug crimes. He also urged the district court not to consider\n\nthe five murders commissioned by DPR, in part because he claimed only to have\n\n\n                                         31\n\ffantasized about the murders, implying that he did not expect them to be carried\n\nout. In its sentencing submission, the government requested that the district\n\ncourt impose a sentence substantially above the twenty-year mandatory\n\nminimum.\n\n      Ulbricht’s sentencing hearing took place on May 29, 2015.22 The district\n\ncourt concluded that Ulbricht’s offense level was 43—the highest possible offense\n\nlevel under the Sentencing Guidelines—and that his criminal history category\n\nwas I.23 The high offense level largely resulted from the massive quantity of\n\ndrugs trafficked using Silk Road, as well as several enhancements, including one\n\nfor directing the use of violence, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(2).24 Ulbricht does not\n\ndispute that calculation. Due to the high offense level, the Guidelines advisory\n\n\n22\n  At sentencing, the district court vacated Ulbricht’s convictions on Counts One\nand Three because they were lesser included offenses of Counts Two and Four\nrespectively. Ulbricht was therefore sentenced on Counts Two, Four, Five, Six,\nand Seven. The district court based its Guidelines calculation only on those\ncounts.\n23\n  The calculated offense level was actually 50, which is higher than the maximum\noffense level of 43 on the Guidelines sentencing table. The Guidelines provide\nthat “[a]n offense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.”\nU.S.S.G. ch. 5 pt. A, cmt. n.2.\n24\n  Because of the grouping rules, U.S.S.G. ch. 3 pt. D, the lower offense levels of\nthe computer hacking and fraudulent identification charges did not contribute to\nUlbricht’s offense level.\n\n                                         32\n\fsentence “range” was life in prison, and the U.S. Probation Office recommended\n\nthat sentence.\n\n      At the sentencing hearing, the district court resolved several disputed\n\nissues of fact. For example, because Ulbricht contested his responsibility for the\n\nfive commissioned murders for hire, the district court found by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that Ulbricht did in fact commission the murders, believing that\n\nthey would be carried out. The district court characterized the evidence of the\n\nmurders for hire, which included Ulbricht’s journal, chats with other Silk Road\n\nusers, and the evidence showing that Ulbricht actually paid a total of $650,000 in\n\nBitcoins for the killings, as “ample and unambiguous.” App’x 1465.\n\n      The court then turned to the six drug-related deaths described in the PSR.\n\nOver Ulbricht’s objection, the district court found that the deaths were “related\n\nconduct relevant to his sentencing” because the “question as to whether this\n\ninformation is properly included in the PSR is whether the Court finds, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence[,] that the deaths, in some way, related to Silk\n\nRoad.” Id. at 1472. It went on to explain that “the relevant offense committed is\n\nthe unlawful distribution of drugs and the running of a criminal drug enterprise,\n\n. . . [and] based on the evidence before the Court, the sale of the drugs through\n\n\n                                         33\n\fSilk Road caused harm to the decedents.” Id. at 1473. The district court described\n\nthe facts associated with five of the deaths and specifically found that each was\n\nconnected to Silk Road, rejecting the defendant’s argument that but-for causation\n\nwas required in order for the court to consider the deaths as relevant to the\n\noffense conduct.25 Parents of two of the decedents also made statements at the\n\nproceeding, describing the emotional impact that the losses had on them and\n\ntheir families.\n\n      In the course of explaining its reasons for choosing Ulbricht’s sentence, the\n\ndistrict court discussed the facts of Ulbricht’s offense, his apparent character, and\n\nthe purposes of criminal punishment. The court described Doctor X as\n\n“enabling,” App’x 1530, rather than reducing the harms associated with drug\n\nuse, emphasized the social costs attendant to expanding the scope of the drug\n\nmarket, discussed the five murders for hire, and stated that the sentence imposed\n\non Ulbricht could have a powerful general deterrent effect because the case had\n\n\n\n\n25\n  The district court did not specifically address one of the six deaths. That\ndecedent was a frequent Silk Road customer who was found dead in his home\nwith a used syringe and other drug paraphernalia. The record does not indicate\nwhy the district court did not discuss that case, and neither party makes any\nargument based on that omission.\n\n                                         34\n\fattracted an unusually large amount of publicity. The court then sentenced\n\nUlbricht principally to life imprisonment.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, Ulbricht raises a number of claims of error. For purposes of\n\norganizational clarity, we group them into three categories, and present them in\n\nthe order in which the issues arose in the district court. Accordingly, we discuss\n\nfirst Ulbricht’s claims that much of the evidence against him should have been\n\nsuppressed because it was obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights;\n\nsecond, his arguments that the district court’s evidentiary errors denied him a\n\nfair trial; and third, his objections to his sentence.\n\nI.    Fourth Amendment Issues\n\n      Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to\n\nsuppress evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. On appeal\n\nfrom a denial of a suppression motion, “we review a district court’s findings of\n\nfact for clear error, and its resolution of questions of law and mixed questions of\n\nlaw and fact de novo.” United States v. Bohannon, 824 F.3d 242, 247-48 (2d Cir.\n\n2016). Ulbricht raises two principal arguments. First, he contends that the\n\n\n                                           35\n\fpen/trap orders that the government used to monitor IP address traffic to and\n\nfrom his home router violated the Fourth Amendment because the government\n\nobtained the orders without a warrant. Second, he claims that the warrants\n\nauthorizing the government to search his laptop as well as his Google and\n\nFacebook accounts violated the Fourth Amendment’s particularity requirement.\n\nWe reject those contentions and affirm the denial of Ulbricht’s motion to\n\nsuppress.\n\n      A. Pen/Trap Orders\n\n      Pursuant to orders issued by United States magistrate judges in the\n\nSouthern District of New York, the government used five pen registers and trap\n\nand trace devices to monitor IP addresses associated with Internet traffic to and\n\nfrom Ulbricht’s wireless home router and devices that regularly connected to that\n\nrouter. The government obtained the orders pursuant to the Pen/Trap Act, which\n\nprovides that a government attorney “may make [an] application for an order . . .\n\nauthorizing or approving the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and\n\ntrace device . . . to a court of competent jurisdiction.” 18 U.S.C. § 3122(a)(1). A\n\n“pen register” is defined as a “device or process which records or decodes\n\ndialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an\n\n\n                                          36\n\finstrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is\n\ntransmitted,” and “shall not include the contents of any communication.” Id.\n\n§ 3127(3). A “trap and trace” device means “a device or process which captures\n\nthe incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number\n\nor other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely\n\nto identify the source of a wire or electronic communication.” Id. § 3127(4). Like\n\npen registers, trap and trace devices may not capture the “contents of any\n\ncommunication.” Id. The statute does not require a search warrant for the use of a\n\npen register or trap and trace device, nor does it demand the kind of showing\n\nrequired to obtain such a warrant. Rather, the statute requires only that the\n\napplication contain a “certification . . . that the information likely to be obtained is\n\nrelevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.” Id. § 3122(b)(2).\n\n      The orders in this case authorized the government to “use a pen register\n\nand trap and trace device to identify the source and destination [IP] addresses,\n\nalong with the dates, times, durations, ports of transmission, and any\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (‘TCP’) connection data,26 associated with any\n\n\n26\n  Data are transmitted on the Internet via discrete packets, rather than in a\ncontinuous stream. TCP is a “communications protocol used to process such data\npackets associated with popular Internet applications,” such as browser and e-\n\n                                          37\n\felectronic communications sent to or from” various devices, including Ulbricht’s\n\nhome wireless router and his laptop.27 S.A. 93. In each order, the government\n\nspecified that it did not seek to obtain the contents of any communications.\n\nInstead, it sought authorization to collect only “dialing, routing, addressing, and\n\nsignaling information” that was akin to data captured by “traditional telephonic\n\npen registers and trap and trace devices.” Id. at 130. Ulbricht claims that the\n\npen/trap orders violated the Fourth Amendment because he had a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy in the IP address routing information that the orders\n\nallowed the government to collect.28\n\n\nmail applications. S.A. 97. Like IP address data, the TCP data that the orders\npermitted the government to acquire do not include the contents of\ncommunications, and Ulbricht has not expressed any independent concern over\nthe government’s collection of TCP connection data.\n27\n  Some of the pen/trap orders phrased the scope of the order slightly differently.\nFor example, one order authorized installing “a trap and trace device to identify\nthe source [IP] address of any Internet communications directed to, and a pen\nregister to determine the destination IP addresses of any Internet\ncommunications originating from,” the relevant devices. S.A. 67. In other words,\nnot every order sought TCP connection data as well as IP address information.\nNeither party has suggested that the differences among the pen/trap orders are\nmaterial to any issue presented by this appeal.\n28\n  In the district court, Ulbricht made the same arguments concerning his Fourth\nAmendment privacy interest in the information captured by the pen registers\nand trap and trace devices. The district court ruled generally that the “type of\ninformation sought [in the orders] was entirely appropriate for that type of\n\n                                         38\n\f       The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that:\n\n“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\n\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\n\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\n\nand particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to\n\nbe seized.” The “cornerstone of the modern law of searches is the principle that,\n\nto mount a successful Fourth Amendment challenge, a defendant must\n\ndemonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place\n\nsearched.” United States v. Haqq, 278 F.3d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Thus, a “Fourth Amendment ‘search[]’ . . . does not occur unless\n\nthe search invades an object or area [in which] one has a subjective expectation of\n\nprivacy that society is prepared to accept as objectively reasonable.” United States\n\nv. Hayes, 551 F.3d 138, 143 (2d Cir. 2008).\n\n      The Supreme Court has long held that a “person has no legitimate\n\nexpectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,”\n\n\norder.” App’x 208. The court declined to address Ulbricht’s “novel Fourth\nAmendment arguments” regarding the pen/trap devices because he had “not\nestablished the requisite privacy interest . . . to” demonstrate his standing to\nchallenge the orders. Id. The government has agreed that Ulbricht has standing to\npursue his Fourth Amendment arguments on appeal.\n\n                                          39\n\fincluding phone numbers dialed in making a telephone call and captured by a\n\npen register. Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (1979). This is so because\n\nphone users “typically know that they must convey numerical information to the\n\nphone company; that the phone company has facilities for recording this\n\ninformation; and that the phone company does in fact record this information for\n\na variety of legitimate business purposes.” Id. at 743. Similarly, “e-mail and\n\nInternet users . . . rely on third-party equipment in order to engage in\n\ncommunication.” United States v. Forrester, 512 F.3d 500, 510 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\nInternet users thus “should know that this information is provided to and used\n\nby Internet service providers for the specific purpose of directing the routing of\n\ninformation.” Id. Moreover, “IP addresses are not merely passively conveyed\n\nthrough third party equipment, but rather are voluntarily turned over in order to\n\ndirect the third party’s servers.” United States v. Christie, 624 F.3d 558, 574 (3d Cir.\n\n2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Ulbricht notes that questions have been raised about whether some aspects\n\nof modern technology, which entrust great quantities of significant personal\n\ninformation to third party vendors, arguably making extensive government\n\nsurveillance possible, call for a re-evaluation of the third-party disclosure\n\n\n                                           40\n\fdoctrine established by Smith. See, e.g., United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 417-18\n\n(2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring); American Civil Liberties Union v. Clapper, 785\n\nF.3d 787, 824 (2d Cir. 2015). We remain bound, however, by that rule until and\n\nunless it is overruled by the Supreme Court. See United States v. Gomez, 580 F.3d\n\n94, 104 (2d Cir. 2009); see also United States v. Wheelock, 772 F.3d 825, 829 (8th Cir.\n\n2014).\n\n         Moreover, whatever novel or more intrusive surveillance techniques might\n\npresent future questions concerning the appropriate scope of the third-party\n\ndisclosure doctrine, the orders in this case do not present such issues. The\n\nrecording of IP address information and similar routing data, which reveal the\n\nexistence of connections between communications devices without disclosing the\n\ncontent of the communications, are precisely analogous to the capture of\n\ntelephone numbers at issue in Smith. That is why the orders here fit comfortably\n\nwithin the language of a statute drafted with the earlier technology in mind. The\n\nsubstitution of electronic methods of communication for telephone calls does not\n\nalone create a reasonable expectation of privacy in the identities of devices with\n\nwhom one communicates. Nor does it raise novel issues distinct from those long\n\nsince resolved in the context of telephone communication, with which society has\n\n\n                                           41\n\flived for the nearly forty years since Smith was decided. Like telephone\n\ncompanies, Internet service providers require that identifying information be\n\ndisclosed in order to make communication among electronic devices possible. In\n\nlight of the Smith rule, no reasonable person could maintain a privacy interest in\n\nthat sort of information.\n\n      We therefore join the other circuits that have considered this narrow\n\nquestion and hold that collecting IP address information devoid of content is\n\n“constitutionally indistinguishable from the use of a pen register.” Forrester, 512\n\nF.3d at 510; see, e.g., Wheelock, 772 F.3d at 828 (holding that the defendant “cannot\n\nclaim a reasonable expectation of privacy in [the] government’s acquisition of his\n\nsubscriber information, including his IP address and name,” because it had been\n\n“revealed to a third party” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Christie, 624 F.3d\n\nat 573 (holding that there is no expectation of privacy in “subscriber information\n\nprovided to an internet provider,” such as an IP address (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)); see also Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 336 (6th Cir. 2001) (holding\n\nthat “computer users do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their\n\n[bulletin board] subscriber information because they have conveyed it to another\n\nperson”); United States v. Graham, 824 F.3d 421, 432 (4th Cir. 2016) (en banc)\n\n\n                                          42\n\f(noting that “third-party information relating to the sending and routing of\n\nelectronic communications does not receive Fourth Amendment protection”);\n\nUnited States v. Carpenter, 819 F.3d 880, 887 (6th Cir. 2016) (“[C]ourts have not\n\n(yet, at least) extended [Fourth Amendment] protections to the internet analogue\n\nto envelope markings, namely the metadata used to route internet\n\ncommunications, like . . . IP addresses.”). Where, as here, the government did not\n\naccess the contents of any of Ulbricht’s communications, it did not need to obtain\n\na warrant to collect IP address routing information in which Ulbricht did not\n\nhave a legitimate privacy interest. We therefore reject Ulbricht’s contention that\n\nthe issuance of such orders violated his Fourth Amendment rights.29\n\n\n\n29\n  The issue presented in this case is narrowly confined to orders that are limited\nto the capture of IP addresses, TCP connection data, and similar routing\ninformation. Our holding therefore does not address other, more invasive\nsurveillance techniques that capture more information (such as content), which\nmay require a warrant issued on probable cause or an order pursuant to Title III\nof the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, codified as amended\nat 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-22. See generally In the Matter of a Warrant for All Content &\nOther Info. Associated with the Email Account xxxxxxx@gmail.com Maintained at\nPremises Controlled by Google, Inc., 33 F. Supp. 3d 386, 393-96 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), as\namended (Aug. 7, 2014) (describing the available caselaw concerning search\nwarrants of email accounts). Similarly, to the extent that some of the out-of-circuit\ncases cited in the text also address the Fourth Amendment status of other types\nof evidence, such as historical cell-site location information, we express no views\non such issues, which are not presented in this case.\n\n                                         43\n\f      Ulbricht’s additional arguments are not persuasive. Ulbricht contends\n\ngenerally that pen/trap orders may monitor a communication’s content by\n\ntracking metadata, but he does not identify what metadata the government might\n\nhave collected or explain how the pen/trap orders in this case gave the\n\ngovernment information concerning the content of his communications. He also\n\nclaims that the orders violated the Fourth Amendment by impermissibly\n\nmonitoring activity within his home, relying on Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27\n\n(2001). In Kyllo, the Court held that using thermal-imaging technology from\n\noutside the home to discern whether a person was growing marijuana in the\n\nhome might reveal innocent, non-criminal information in which a resident has a\n\nprivacy interest. Id. at 38. Ulbricht contends that monitoring IP address traffic\n\nthrough his router is similar to the thermal-imaging technology because it might\n\nreveal when and how Ulbricht used his computer when he was at home. The\n\nsame can be said, however, of an ordinary telephone pen register, which can\n\nreveal if, when, and how a person uses his or her home phone to make calls. See\n\nSmith, 442 U.S. at 743. IP address traffic similarly reveals whether an Internet\n\nsubscriber (or, more precisely, a person who uses the subscriber’s Internet\n\nconnection) is home and using the Internet. Nothing in Kyllo suggests that\n\n\n                                         44\n\fgovernment monitoring of data disclosed to an outside telephone or Internet\n\nprovider for ordinary business purposes becomes constitutionally suspect when\n\ninvestigators use that information to draw inferences about whether someone is\n\nmaking telephone calls or accessing websites from inside his or her home. We\n\ntherefore see no constitutional difference between monitoring home phone\n\ndialing information and IP address routing data. Thus, we conclude that the pen\n\nregister and trap and trace orders did not violate the Fourth Amendment.30\n\n      B. Search Warrants\n\n      Ulbricht also contends that the warrants authorizing the search and seizure\n\nof his laptop as well as his Facebook and Google accounts violated the Fourth\n\n\n\n30\n  Ulbricht’s alternative argument, that the pen/trap orders violated the Pen/Trap\nAct and the Stored Communications Act (“SCA”) because they sought\nprospective data, is without merit. Ulbricht claims that the orders were obtained\nboth through the Pen/Trap Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27, and the SCA, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2703(d). To the contrary, each pen/trap order (and the underlying requests for\nsuch orders) relied exclusively on the Pen/Trap Act, not the SCA. The fact that\none of the government’s goals was to monitor IP address traffic to match\nUlbricht’s Internet activity with DPR’s does not undermine the validity of the\norders. The orders themselves did not allow the government to track the location\nof the router and other equipment to which the trap and trace device was\nattached. Thus, they were not “geo-locating” devices, as Ulbricht suggests, any\nmore than subpoenas for hotel registers, parking tickets, and credit card receipts,\nor any other methods by which the government obtains information that can be\nused to identify a suspect’s location at particular points in time.\n\n                                        45\n\fAmendment’s particularity requirement. The Fourth Amendment explicitly\n\ncommands that warrants must be based on probable cause and must\n\n“particularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\n\nseized.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. “It is familiar history that indiscriminate searches\n\nand seizures conducted under the authority of ‘general warrants’ were the\n\nimmediate evils that motivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.” Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 583 (1980). Those general\n\nwarrants “specified only an offense,” leaving “to the discretion of the executing\n\nofficials the decision as to which persons should be arrested and which places\n\nshould be searched.” Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 220 (1981). The\n\nprincipal defect in such a warrant was that it permitted a “general, exploratory\n\nrummaging in a person’s belongings,” Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 480\n\n(1976) (internal quotation marks omitted), a problem that the Fourth Amendment\n\nattempted to resolve by requiring the warrant to “set out with particularity” the\n\n“scope of the authorized search,” Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452, 459 (2011).31\n\n\n31\n  In addition to preventing general searches, the particularity requirement serves\ntwo other purposes not relevant to this appeal: “preventing the seizure of objects\nupon the mistaken assumption that they fall within the magistrate’s\nauthorization, and preventing the issuance of warrants without a substantial\nfactual basis.” United States v. Young, 745 F.2d 733, 759 (2d Cir. 1984).\n\n                                         46\n\f      To be sufficiently particular under the Fourth Amendment, a warrant must\n\nsatisfy three requirements. First, “a warrant must identify the specific offense for\n\nwhich the police have established probable cause.” United States v. Galpin, 720\n\nF.3d 436, 445 (2d Cir. 2013). Second, “a warrant must describe the place to be\n\nsearched.” Id. at 445-46. Finally, the “warrant must specify the items to be seized\n\nby their relation to designated crimes.” Id. at 446 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      “Where, as here, the property to be searched is a computer hard drive, the\n\nparticularity requirement assumes even greater importance.” Id. A general search\n\nof electronic data is an especially potent threat to privacy because hard drives\n\nand e-mail accounts may be “akin to a residence in terms of the scope and\n\nquantity of private information [they] may contain.” Id. The “seizure of a\n\ncomputer hard drive, and its subsequent retention by the government, can\n\n[therefore] give the government possession of a vast trove of personal\n\ninformation about the person to whom the drive belongs, much of which may be\n\nentirely irrelevant to the criminal investigation that led to the seizure.” United\n\nStates v. Ganias, 824 F.3d 199, 217 (2d Cir. 2016) (en banc). Such sensitive records\n\nmight include “[t]ax records, diaries, personal photographs, electronic books,\n\n\n                                          47\n\felectronic media, medical data, records of internet searches, [and] banking and\n\nshopping information.” Id. at 218. Because of the nature of digital storage, it is not\n\nalways feasible to “extract and segregate responsive data from non-responsive\n\ndata,” id. at 213, creating a “serious risk that every warrant for electronic\n\ninformation will become, in effect, a general warrant,” Galpin, 720 F.3d at 447\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we have held that warrants that fail to\n\n“link [the evidence sought] to the criminal activity supported by probable cause”\n\ndo not satisfy the particularity requirement because they “lack[] meaningful\n\nparameters on an otherwise limitless search” of a defendant’s electronic media.\n\nUnited States v. Rosa, 626 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir. 2010).\n\n      The Fourth Amendment does not require a perfect description of the data\n\nto be searched and seized, however. Search warrants covering digital data may\n\ncontain “some ambiguity . . . so long as law enforcement agents have done the\n\nbest that could reasonably be expected under the circumstances, have acquired\n\nall the descriptive facts which a reasonable investigation could be expected to\n\ncover, and have insured that all those facts were included in the warrant.” Galpin,\n\n720 F.3d at 446 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\f      Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that a search warrant does not\n\nnecessarily lack particularity simply because it is broad. Since a search of a\n\ncomputer is “akin to [a search of] a residence,” id., searches of computers may\n\nsometimes need to be as broad as searches of residences pursuant to warrants.\n\nSimilarly, traditional searches for paper records, like searches for electronic\n\nrecords, have always entailed the exposure of records that are not the objects of\n\nthe search to at least superficial examination in order to identify and seize those\n\nrecords that are. And in many cases, the volume of records properly subject to\n\nseizure because of their evidentiary value may be vast. None of these\n\nconsequences necessarily turns a search warrant into a prohibited general\n\nwarrant.\n\n             1. Laptop Search Warrant\n\n      The warrant authorizing the search and seizure of Ulbricht’s laptop (the\n\n“Laptop Warrant”) explicitly incorporated by reference an affidavit listing the\n\ncrimes charged, which at the time included narcotics trafficking, computer\n\nhacking, money laundering, and murder-for-hire offenses in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030, 1956, and 1958. See In re 650 Fifth Ave. & Related\n\nProperties, 830 F.3d 66, 101 (2d Cir. 2016) (describing the requirements for a\n\n\n                                          49\n\fcriminal search warrant’s incorporation of an affidavit by reference).32 The\n\naffidavit also described the workings of Silk Road and the role of Dread Pirate\n\nRoberts in operating the site and included a wealth of information supporting a\n\nfinding that there was probable cause to believe that Ulbricht and DPR were the\n\nsame person. Based on that information, the Laptop Warrant alleged that\n\nUlbricht “use[d] [the laptop] in connection with his operation of Silk Road,” and\n\nthat there was “probable cause to believe that evidence, fruits, and\n\ninstrumentalities of the [charged offenses]” would be found on the laptop. S.A.\n\n246.33\n\n         Generally speaking, the Laptop Warrant divided the information to be\n\nsearched for and seized into two categories. The first covered evidence\n\nconcerning Silk Road that was located on the computer, including, inter alia,\n\n“data associated with the Silk Road website, such as web content, server code, or\n\ndatabase records”; any evidence concerning servers or computer equipment\n\nconnected with Silk Road; e-mails, private messages, and forum postings or\n\n\n32\n Because the warrant incorporated the affidavit by reference, we refer to the\ndocuments together as the Laptop Warrant for the sake of simplicity.\n33\n  Ulbricht does not challenge the existence of probable cause to believe both that\nhe committed these offenses and that the laptop would contain evidence of them.\n\n                                         50\n\f“other communications concerning Silk Road in any way”; evidence concerning\n\n“funds used to facilitate or proceeds derived from Silk Road,” including Bitcoin\n\nwallet files and transactions with Bitcoin exchangers, or “information concerning\n\nany financial accounts . . . where Silk Road funds may be stored”; and “any\n\nevidence concerning any illegal activity associated with Silk Road.” Id. at 246-48.\n\n      The second category of information in the Laptop Warrant included\n\n“evidence relevant to corroborating the identification of Ulbricht as the Silk Road\n\nuser ‘Dread Pirate Roberts.’” Id. at 248. In order to connect Ulbricht with DPR,\n\nthe Laptop Warrant authorized agents to search for: “any communications or\n\nwritings by Ulbricht, which may reflect linguistic patterns or idiosyncra[s]ies\n\nassociated with ‘Dread Pirate Roberts,’ or political/economic views associated\n\nwith [DPR] . . .”; “any evidence concerning any computer equipment, software,\n\nor usernames used by Ulbricht, to allow comparison with” computer equipment\n\nused by DPR; “any evidence concerning Ulbricht’s travel or patterns of\n\nmovement, to allow comparison with patterns of online activity of [DPR]”; “any\n\nevidence concerning Ulbricht’s technical expertise concerning Tor, Bitcoins,” and\n\nother computer programming issues; any evidence concerning Ulbricht’s\n\nattempts to “obtain fake identification documents,” use aliases, or otherwise\n\n\n                                         51\n\fevade law enforcement; and “any other evidence implicating Ulbricht in the\n\nsubject offenses.” Id. at 248-49 (footnote omitted).\n\n      After careful consideration of the warrant, the supporting affidavit, and\n\nUlbricht’s arguments, we conclude that the Laptop Warrant did not violate the\n\nFourth Amendment’s particularity requirement.34 We note, at the outset of our\n\nreview, that the warrant plainly satisfies the basic elements of the particularity\n\nrequirement as traditionally understood. By incorporating the affidavit by\n\nreference, the Laptop Warrant lists the charged crimes, describes the place to be\n\nsearched, and designates the information to be seized in connection with the\n\nspecified offenses. Each category of information sought is relevant to Silk Road,\n\nDPR’s operation thereof, or identifying Ulbricht as DPR. We do not understand\n\nUlbricht’s arguments to contest the Laptop Warrant’s basic compliance with\n\nthose requirements.35\n\n\n34\n  The district court ruled that Ulbricht did not have standing to raise his Fourth\nAmendment challenges because he did not establish that he had a personal\nexpectation of privacy in the laptop or his Facebook and Google accounts. We\nexpress no view on that issue, since the district court also reached the merits of\nthe motion to suppress and the government has agreed that Ulbricht has\nstanding to challenge the warrants and accompanying searches.\n35\n It is worth noting that Ulbricht does not challenge the validity of the search\nwarrant covering his home, although that warrant is quite similar to the Laptop\n\n                                          52\n\f      Rather, Ulbricht’s arguments turn on the special problems associated with\n\nsearches of computers which, as we have acknowledged in prior cases, Galpin,\n\n720 F.3d at 447; Ganias, 824 F.3d at 217-18, can be particularly intrusive. These\n\narguments merit careful attention. For example, Ulbricht questions the\n\nappropriateness of the protocols that the Laptop Warrant instructed officers to\n\nuse in executing the search. Those procedures included opening or “cursorily\n\nreading the first few” pages of files to “determine their precise contents,”\n\nsearching for deliberately hidden files, using “key word searches through all\n\nelectronic storage areas,” and reviewing file “directories” to determine what was\n\nrelevant. S.A. 253. Ulbricht, supported by amicus the National Association of\n\nCriminal Defense Lawyers (“NACDL”), argues that the warrant was\n\ninsufficiently particular because the government and the magistrate judge failed\n\nto specify the search terms and protocols ex ante in the warrant.\n\n      We cannot agree. As illustrated by the facts of this very case, it will often\n\nbe impossible to identify in advance the words or phrases that will separate\n\nrelevant files or documents before the search takes place, because officers cannot\n\n\nWarrant and appears to be just as broad. Specifically, the home search warrant\nallows the government to search for and seize evidence concerning Ulbricht’s\ntravel or patterns of movement and any of his communications or writings.\n\n                                         53\n\freadily anticipate how a suspect will store information related to the charged\n\ncrimes. Files and documents can easily be given misleading or coded names, and\n\nwords that might be expected to occur in pertinent documents can be encrypted;\n\neven very simple codes can defeat a pre-planned word search. For example, at\n\nleast one of the folders on Ulbricht’s computer had a name with the misspelling\n\n“aliaces.” App’x 309. For a more challenging example, Ulbricht also kept records\n\nof certain Tor chats in a file on his laptop that was labeled “mbsobzvkhwx4hmjt.”\n\nId. at 398.36\n\n       The agents reasonably anticipated that they would face such problems in\n\nthis case. Operating Silk Road involved using sophisticated technology to mask\n\nits users’ identities. Accordingly, although we acknowledge the NACDL’s\n\nsuggestions in its amicus submission for limiting the scope of such search terms,\n\nthe absence of the proposed limitations does not violate the particularity\n\n\n36\n  We note that Ulbricht and amicus NACDL somewhat exaggerate the novelty of\ncomputer searches in this regard. A traditional physical search for paper “drug\nrecords” or “tax records” may entail a similar examination of all sorts of files and\npapers to determine whether such records are hidden in files with innocuous or\nmisleading names or written in coded terms to mask their content. For obvious\nreasons, search warrants authorizing the seizure of such evidence have not\ntraditionally specified that agents may look only at file folders labeled “drug\nrecords” or may seize only papers containing the word “cocaine”—the\nequivalent of the ex ante “search terms” demanded by Ulbricht.\n\n                                         54\n\frequirement on the facts of this case. We therefore conclude that, in preparing the\n\nLaptop Warrant, “law enforcement agents [did] the best that could reasonably be\n\nexpected under the circumstances, [had] acquired all the descriptive facts which\n\na reasonable investigation could be expected to cover, and [had] insured that all\n\nthose facts were included in the warrant.” Galpin, 720 F.3d at 446 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      The fundamental flaw in Ulbricht’s (and the NACDL’s) argument is that it\n\nconfuses a warrant’s breadth with a lack of particularity. As noted above, breadth\n\nand particularity are related but distinct concepts. A warrant may be broad, in\n\nthat it authorizes the government to search an identified location or object for a\n\nwide range of potentially relevant material, without violating the particularity\n\nrequirement. For example, a warrant may allow the government to search a\n\nsuspected drug dealer’s entire home where there is probable cause to believe that\n\nevidence relevant to that activity may be found anywhere in the residence.\n\nSimilarly, “[w]hen the criminal activity pervades [an] entire business, seizure of\n\nall records of the business is appropriate, and broad language used in warrants\n\nwill not offend the particularity requirements.” U.S. Postal Serv. v. C.E.C. Servs.,\n\n869 F.2d 184, 187 (2d Cir. 1989). Ulbricht used his laptop to commit the charged\n\n\n                                          55\n\foffenses by creating and continuing to operate Silk Road. Thus, a broad warrant\n\nallowing the government to search his laptop for potentially extensive evidence\n\nof those crimes does not offend the Fourth Amendment, as long as that warrant\n\nmeets the three particularity criteria outlined above.\n\n      It is also true that allowing law enforcement to search his writings for\n\nlinguistic similarities with DPR authorizes a broad search of written materials on\n\nUlbricht’s hard drive. That fact, however, does not mean that the warrants\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. The Laptop Warrant clearly explained that the\n\ngovernment planned to compare Ulbricht’s writings to DPR’s posts to confirm\n\nthat they were the same person, by identifying both linguistic patterns and\n\ndistinctive shared political or economic views. Ulbricht and the NACDL similarly\n\nclaim that searching for all evidence of his travel patterns and movement violates\n\nthe Fourth Amendment’s particularity requirement. Again, the warrant\n\nexplained that it sought information about Ulbricht’s travel “to allow comparison\n\nwith patterns of online activity of ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ and any information\n\nknown about his location at particular times.” S.A. 248. Thus, the Laptop Warrant\n\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\fconnects the information sought to the crimes charged and, more specifically, its\n\nrelevance to identifying Ulbricht as the perpetrator of those crimes.37\n\n      We remain sensitive to the difficulties associated with preserving a\n\ncriminal defendant’s privacy while searching through his electronic data and\n\ncomputer hard drives. In the course of searching for information related to Silk\n\nRoad and DPR, the government may indeed have come across personal\n\ndocuments that were unrelated to Ulbricht’s crimes. Such an invasion of a\n\ncriminal defendant’s privacy is inevitable, however, in almost any warranted\n\nsearch because in “searches for papers, it is certain that some innocuous\n\ndocuments will be examined, at least cursorily, in order to determine whether\n\n\n37\n  Evidence revealing a suspect’s past movements is often highly relevant to a\ncriminal investigation. Such evidence might be used to establish—or rule\nout—the suspect’s presence at a crime scene or other pertinent location at a\nparticular time. It may also disclose other, unrelated information about the\nsuspect’s non-criminal associations, interests, and behavior, and may be drawn\nfrom a wide variety of sources. Government efforts to develop such information,\nincluding by search warrants authorizing its seizure, are not inherently\nquestionable under the Fourth Amendment. Using piecemeal or laborious\ninvestigative techniques, it might take law enforcement officers a great deal of\ntime and effort to compile a comprehensive record of a suspect’s travel or other\nmovements. The fact that extensive travel records are stored on a digital device\nand may be accessed readily via a keystroke or quick search does not immunize\nthose records from seizure. Indeed, the seizure of a paper journal or calendar in a\nconventional search will often allow officers to map out a defendant’s travel\nhistory with similar ease.\n\n                                         57\n\fthey are, in fact, among those papers authorized to be seized.” Ganias, 824 F.3d at\n\n211, quoting Andresen, 427 U.S. at 482 n.11. The Fourth Amendment limits such\n\n“unwarranted intrusions upon privacy,” id. (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\nby requiring a warrant to describe its scope with particularity. The Laptop\n\nWarrant satisfied that requirement. Ulbricht has challenged only the facial\n\nvalidity of the Laptop Warrant and not its execution. Because we have no reason\n\nto doubt that the officers faithfully executed the warrant, its execution did not\n\nresult in an undue invasion of Ulbricht’s privacy.\n\n      Finally, we note that the crimes charged in this case were somewhat\n\nunusual. This case does not involve a more typical situation in which officers\n\nsearched for evidence of a physician’s illegal distribution of pain medications, to\n\nuse the NACDL’s example, which may have electronically-stored data associated\n\nwith the alleged crimes on a hard drive that largely contains non-criminal\n\ninformation. Here the crimes under investigation were committed largely\n\nthrough computers that there was probable cause to believe included the laptop\n\nat issue, and the search warrant application gave ample basis for the issuing\n\nmagistrate judge to conclude that evidence related to Silk Road and Ulbricht’s\n\nuse of the DPR username likely permeated Ulbricht’s computer. Thus, given the\n\n\n                                         58\n\fnature of Ulbricht’s crimes and their symbiotic connection to his digital devices,\n\nwe decline to rethink the well-settled Fourth Amendment principles that the\n\nLaptop Warrant may implicate. A future case may require this Court to articulate\n\nspecial limitations on digital searches to effectuate the Fourth Amendment’s\n\nparticularity or reasonableness requirements. Such a case is not before us.\n\n             2. The Google and Facebook Warrants\n\n      Ulbricht also challenges the warrants that allowed the government to\n\nsearch his Google and Facebook accounts, although he does not present any\n\nspecific arguments related to those warrants. Both warrants, through affidavits\n\nincorporated by reference, set forth the basis for probable cause to search those\n\naccounts for evidence of Ulbricht’s involvement in Silk Road. The warrants also\n\nauthorized the government to search his Google and Facebook accounts for\n\n“evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities” of the specified offenses, including, inter\n\nalia: “any communications or writings by Ulbricht”; “any evidence concerning\n\nany computer equipment, software, or usernames used by Ulbricht”; “any\n\nevidence concerning Ulbricht’s travel or patterns of movement”; and any “other\n\nevidence of the” crimes charged. S.A. 334-35, 393-94. The scope of the Google and\n\nFacebook warrants thus substantially paralleled that of the Laptop Warrant.\n\n\n                                         59\n\f      The Google and Facebook warrants were constitutional for the same\n\nreasons that the Laptop Warrant was valid. They satisfied all three of the\n\nparticularity requirements because they listed the subject offenses, described the\n\nthings to be searched, and identified the information to be seized in relation to\n\nthe charged crimes. Ulbricht does not advance any additional arguments specific\n\nto the Google and Facebook warrants, nor have we identified any independent\n\nreason to find them unconstitutionally lacking in specificity.\n\n             3. Conclusion\n\n      In sum, the issuance of the pen/trap orders and the three search warrants\n\nthat Ulbricht challenges in this appeal did not violate the Fourth Amendment.38\n\nThus, we affirm the district court’s denial of Ulbricht’s suppression motion.\n\nII.   The District Court’s Trial Rulings and Ulbricht’s Rule 33 Motion\n\n      Ulbricht contends that he did not receive a fair trial for several reasons:\n\n(1) the district court’s rulings surrounding corrupt agents Force and Bridges\n\n\n38\n  The government also contends that, even if the warrants were invalid, the good\nfaith exception prevents the application of the exclusionary rule. In general, the\n“exclusion of evidence is inappropriate when the government acts in objectively\nreasonable reliance on a search warrant, even when the warrant is subsequently\ninvalidated.” Ganias, 824 F.3d at 221 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because\nwe conclude that all three of the warrants were valid, we need not address the\ngovernment’s alternative argument.\n\n                                         60\n\fviolated his due process rights; (2) the district court erroneously precluded two\n\ndefense experts from testifying; (3) the district court abused its discretion when it\n\ncurtailed Ulbricht’s cross-examination of two government witnesses; and (4) the\n\ndistrict court erred when it ruled that certain hearsay statements were\n\ninadmissible. He also contends that, even if each individual error is harmless, the\n\ncumulative effect of those errors prejudiced him to the extent that his trial was\n\nfundamentally unfair. We detect no error in the district court’s rulings on any of\n\nthose issues and therefore conclude that Ulbricht was not deprived of his right to\n\na fair trial.\n\n       A. Corrupt Agents Force and Bridges\n\n       Ulbricht’s principal fair trial argument is that the district court erred in\n\nnumerous ways by preventing him from relying on information related to the\n\ncorruption of two federal agents, Force and Bridges, involved in the investigation\n\nof the Silk Road site. Before trial, the district court (1) precluded Ulbricht from\n\nreferring at trial to the secret grand jury proceeding against Force; (2) denied\n\nUlbricht discovery related to the Force investigation; and (3) denied Ulbricht an\n\nadjournment of the trial until the Force investigation was complete. During trial,\n\nthe district court excluded as hearsay certain chats that related to Force’s illicit\n\n\n                                           61\n\fuse of Silk Road. Finally, Ulbricht learned after trial that the government was\n\ninvestigating a second corrupt agent, Bridges. Ulbricht contends that the failure\n\nto disclose Bridges’s corruption until after the trial violated Brady v. Maryland, 373\n\nU.S. 83 (1963), and that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a new\n\ntrial on that ground.\n\n      Without question, the shocking personal corruption of these two\n\ngovernment agents disgraced the agencies for which they worked and\n\nembarrassed the many honorable men and women working in those agencies to\n\ninvestigate serious criminal wrongdoing. Even more importantly, when law\n\nenforcement officers abuse their offices for personal gain, commit other criminal\n\nacts, violate the rights of citizens, or lie under oath, they undermine the public’s\n\nvital trust in the integrity of law enforcement. They may also compromise the\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions on which they work.\n\n      At the same time, the venality of individual agents does not necessarily\n\naffect the reliability of the government’s evidence in a particular case or become\n\nrelevant to the adjudication of every case in which the agents participated. Courts\n\nare obligated to ensure that probative evidence is disclosed to the defense,\n\ncarefully evaluated by the court for its materiality to the case, and submitted for\n\n\n                                         62\n\fthe jury’s consideration where admissible. But courts must also take care that\n\nwrongdoing by investigators that has no bearing on the matter before the court\n\nnot be used as a diversion from fairly assessing the prosecution’s case. Like any\n\nother potential evidence, information about police corruption must be evaluated\n\nby reference to the ordinary rules of criminal procedure and evidence, a task to\n\nwhich we now turn.\n\n             1. Background: Pretrial Disclosure of the Force Investigation\n\n      The government disclosed its investigation into Force’s corruption to the\n\ndefense about six weeks before trial. Initially, on November 21, 2014, the\n\ngovernment wrote a sealed ex parte letter to the district court seeking permission\n\nto disclose to the defense information about the Force grand jury investigation\n\nsubject to a protective order.39 The district court granted the application. On\n\nDecember 1, the government provided a copy of the November 21 letter, which\n\notherwise remained sealed, to defense counsel. According to the letter, Force\n\nleaked information to DPR in exchange for payment and “corruptly obtain[ed]\n\n\n\n39\n  The government required such an order because grand jury proceedings are\nsecret and a government attorney “must not disclose a matter occurring before\nthe grand jury,” Rule 6(e)(2)(B)(vi), Fed. R. Crim. P., without a court order, Rule\n6(e)(3)(E), subject to limited exceptions not relevant here.\n\n                                         63\n\fproceeds from the Silk Road website and convert[ed] them to his personal\n\nuse.”App’x 649. The government then undertook to purge its trial evidence of\n\nanything arguably traceable to Force.\n\n      Ulbricht moved to unseal the entire November 21 letter so that he could\n\nrely on the information in the letter that related to Force’s corruption at trial,\n\narguing that the letter included Brady information and that he therefore had a\n\nparticularized need to disclose the information that outweighed the presumption\n\nof grand jury secrecy. He also requested discovery and subpoenas under Rules 16\n\nand 17, Fed. R. Crim. P., to learn more about the scope of Force’s corruption. In\n\nthe alternative, Ulbricht sought an adjournment of the trial until the Force\n\ninvestigation concluded and information about his corruption might become\n\npublic through the filing of charges against him. On December 15, the district\n\ncourt held a sealed hearing on that issue and invited further written submissions,\n\nincluding a particularized list of Ulbricht’s discovery requests. One week later,\n\nthe district court issued a sealed and partially redacted opinion40 denying all of\n\n\n40\n  Portions of the district court opinion were redacted because they referenced the\ndefendant’s ex parte submissions explaining how he would use information\nrelated to the Force investigation at trial. This Court has reviewed an unredacted\nversion of the district court opinion in connection with this appeal, but not the ex\nparte letters that the opinion references.\n\n                                          64\n\fUlbricht’s requests. The court did indicate, however, that throughout the trial it\n\nwould “entertain specific requests to use information from the November 21,\n\n2014 Letter on cross-examination.” App’x 700. Moreover, the court explained that\n\nit would “entertain a renewed application” for a “particularized disclosure” of\n\nfacts relevant to Force’s corruption if the government’s trial tactics or evidence\n\n“open[ed] the door” to such facts. Id.\n\n             2. Preclusion of Force Investigation Evidence: Rule 6(e)\n\n      On appeal, Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to unseal the November 21 letter because he demonstrated a\n\nparticularized need that rebutted the presumption of secrecy that attaches to\n\ngrand jury investigations. We disagree.\n\n      “[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the\n\nsecrecy of grand jury proceedings.” Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops\n\nNw., 441 U.S. 211, 218 (1979). We have described five rationales for such secrecy:\n\n             (1) To prevent the escape of those whose indictment\n             may be contemplated; (2) to insure the utmost freedom\n             to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n             persons subject to indictment or their friends from\n             importuning the grand jurors; (3) to prevent\n             subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses\n             who may testify before the grand jury and later appear\n\n\n                                          65\n\f             at the trial of those indicted by it; (4) to encourage free\n             and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n             information with respect to the commission of crimes;\n             (5) to protect the innocent accused who is exonerated\n             from disclosure of the fact that he has been under\n             investigation, and from the expense of standing trial\n             where there was no probability of guilt.\n\nIn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 103 F.3d 234, 237 (2d Cir. 1996). Rule 6(e)(6) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure implements this policy of secrecy by\n\nrequiring that “all records, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand jury\n\nproceedings [must] be sealed.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 103 F.3d at 237\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n      Information falling within Rule 6(e)’s protections is entitled to a\n\n“presumption of secrecy and closure.” Id. at 239. To rebut the presumption of\n\nsecrecy, the party “seeking disclosure [must] show a particularized need that\n\noutweighs the need for secrecy.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). To prove\n\na particularized need, parties seeking disclosure must show that the “material\n\nthey seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding,\n\nthat the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and\n\nthat their request is structured to cover only material so needed.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). “A district court’s decision as to whether the burden of\n\n\n                                          66\n\fshowing a particularized interest has been met will be overturned only if the\n\ncourt has abused its discretion.” Id.\n\n      We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion when it denied\n\nUlbricht’s request to unseal the November 21 letter discussing the Force grand\n\njury investigation. It is undisputed that the letter contained information related to\n\na grand jury proceeding that, if made public, would disclose matters occurring\n\nbefore the grand jury. Ulbricht did not demonstrate a particularized need for\n\ndisclosure because he did not show that the need for disclosure was greater than\n\nthe need for continued secrecy or that a possible injustice would result if the\n\ngrand jury investigation was not disclosed. Specifically, the district court did not\n\nerr in concluding that revealing the entire letter could have compromised the\n\nForce grand jury investigation in a number of ways. For example, potential co-\n\nconspirators might have learned of the investigation and attempted to intimidate\n\nwitnesses or destroy evidence. The investigation was also likely to garner\n\nsignificant media attention, a fact that might influence witnesses or grand jurors.\n\nAnd, although Force knew of the investigation, revealing its existence to the\n\npublic might have harmed him if the allegations had ultimately proved untrue.\n\nFinally, Ulbricht’s request was not structured to cover only the information\n\n\n                                         67\n\fneeded to avoid any possible injustice; instead, he sought to unseal the entire\n\nNovember 21 letter and did not propose a more narrowly tailored disclosure.\n\n      In redacted portions of its opinion, the district court also considered ex\n\nparte arguments concerning how the Force investigation might be relevant to\n\nUlbricht’s defense. In general terms, Ulbricht argued that the agents’ corruption\n\nwas critical to his defense because it would reveal the agents’ ability to falsify\n\nevidence against him and demonstrate their motive to do so. According to the\n\ndistrict court’s characterization of his ex parte letters, Ulbricht speculated that\n\nForce may have used Curtis Green’s (Flush) administrative capabilities to\n\nimpersonate DPR; Force’s corrupt conduct might have demonstrated technical\n\nvulnerabilities in the site that would render it susceptible to hacking; and\n\nlearning that Force had good information about the Silk Road investigation might\n\nhave caused the true DPR to recruit Ulbricht as his successor.41\n\n\n41\n  As noted above, see note 5, we have carefully considered to what extent it is\nappropriate to refer to portions of the record that remain under seal. We have\nbeen especially careful in describing the portions of the district court’s opinion\nthat remain redacted and therefore are still not available to the government or to\nthe public. We appreciate that charges against Ulbricht remain pending in\nMaryland and that the redacted information describes what would have been his\ntrial strategy had he been able to reference Force’s corruption. We have thus\ndescribed the defense’s redacted arguments at a fairly high level of generality.\nWe are confident that any experienced prosecutor could anticipate those\n\n                                          68\n\f      The district court reasoned that much of the information that might have\n\narguably supported any of those theories was made available to the defense in\n\ndiscovery. The only new information in the November 21 letter concerned the\n\ninvestigation of Force’s corruption; the fact of that investigation and its scope\n\ndoes not bolster any of the defense theories that Ulbricht described before the\n\ndistrict court or on appeal. That Force was personally corrupt and used his\n\nundercover identity to steal money from Silk Road and DPR does not suggest\n\neither a motive or an ability on his part to frame Ulbricht as DPR. Absent any\n\nexplanation of how Force could have orchestrated a massive plant of\n\nincriminating information on Ulbricht’s personal laptop, his larcenous behavior\n\ndoes not advance the claim that such a frame-up was possible beyond mere\n\n\n\n\narguments, and that in any event the information is largely stated or implied in\nUlbricht’s own publicly filed briefs on appeal. Particularly given that our\ndescription relates to how the Force information might have been used at a trial\nthat is now completed, and that we now hold that Ulbricht is not entitled to a\nnew trial, we conclude that the public’s need to understand and evaluate\nUlbricht’s arguments that he was unfairly prejudiced by the district court’s\nrulings, as well as our reasons for rejecting those arguments, outweighs any\nminimal interest that Ulbricht might have in withholding his contentions from\nthe government.\n\n                                         69\n\fspeculation. Thus, Ulbricht was equally capable of presenting his various defense\n\ntheories to the jury with or without the November 21 letter.42\n\n      The government’s commitment to eliminating all evidence that came from\n\nForce’s work on the Silk Road investigation43 further undermines Ulbricht’s claim\n\nthat he needed the information to avoid a possible injustice. Had Force been\n\ncalled as a government witness, or had any of the government’s evidence relied\n\non his credibility, his character for truthfulness would have been at issue during\n\nthe trial, and information that impeached his credibility would have become\n\nhighly relevant. Ulbricht’s reliance on the general fact of cooperation among\n\ndifferent government agencies and different U.S. Attorney’s Offices does not\n\nundermine the government’s explicit representations that none of the evidence\n\npresented at trial derived from Force, and nothing in the record suggests that\n\n\n\n\n42\n  Even on appeal, moreover, after the disclosure of additional information in the\nprosecutions of Bridges and Force, Ulbricht does not provide any concrete\nexplanation of how the techniques used by the corrupt agents to steal money\nfrom Silk Road could have been used, by them or by others, to plant the massive\namounts of incriminating information found on Ulbricht’s laptop and in his\nhouse.\n43\n  For example, the government declined to present evidence of DPR’s attempt to\ncommission an additional murder because that conduct involved Force acting as\nNob.\n\n                                        70\n\fthose representations were false. Ulbricht had no need to rely on the grand jury\n\ninvestigation of Force to attack the credibility of the actual government witnesses\n\nor the integrity of its other evidence.\n\n      In sum, Ulbricht has not shown that the district court abused its discretion\n\nin maintaining the secrecy of the Force grand jury investigation. He did not\n\ndemonstrate to the district court, and has not demonstrated on appeal, that\n\nkeeping the November 21 letter under seal resulted in any injustice, or that his\n\nneed for disclosing the investigation was greater than the need for continued\n\nsecrecy.44\n\n             3. Denial of Discovery Related to Force\n\n      Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying him discovery,\n\nincluding requested subpoenas, related to the Force investigation. Rule\n\n16(a)(1)(E), Fed. R. Crim. P., requires the government to disclose information\n\nwithin its control if the information is “material to preparing the defense” or will\n\n\n44\n  Moreover, the district court specifically ruled that it would entertain Ulbricht’s\napplications to rely on specific parts of the letter at trial if doing so would be\nnecessary for effective cross-examination. Thus, Ulbricht was given the\nopportunity to show particularized need in the context of specific trial evidence.\nUlbricht has not identified any point in the trial where he attempted to show that\nForce’s behavior had become relevant to challenging the credibility of particular\naspects of the prosecution’s case.\n\n                                          71\n\fbe a part of the government’s case-in-chief. Evidence is material if it “could be\n\nused to counter the government’s case or to bolster a defense.” United States v.\n\nStevens, 985 F.2d 1175, 1180 (2d Cir. 1993). “An appellate court, in assessing the\n\nmateriality of withheld information, considers not only the logical relationship\n\nbetween the information and the issues in the case, but also the importance of the\n\ninformation in light of the evidence as a whole.” Id. To justify a new trial, there\n\n“must be some indication that the pretrial disclosure of the disputed evidence\n\nwould have enabled the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in\n\nhis favor.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Rule 17(c), Fed. R. Crim. P., allows parties to subpoena documents and\n\nobjects to be introduced at criminal trials. A subpoena must meet three criteria:\n\n“(1) relevancy; (2) admissibility; [and] (3) specificity.” United States v. Nixon, 418\n\nU.S. 683, 700 (1974). The party requesting the subpoena must also show that the\n\ninformation sought is “not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by\n\nexercise of due diligence,” that “the party cannot properly prepare for trial\n\nwithout such production,” and that “the application is made in good faith and is\n\nnot intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” Id. at 699-700. We review the\n\n\n\n\n                                           72\n\fdistrict court’s discovery rulings for abuse of discretion. United States v. Rigas, 583\n\nF.3d 108, 125 (2d Cir. 2009).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Ulbricht’s\n\ndiscovery requests related to the Force investigation. Ulbricht submitted 28\n\nindividual discovery requests in connection with the Force disclosure. Those\n\nranged from the reasonably specific, such as “records from any and all Bitcoin\n\naccounts” used by Force, to the very broad, such as “any spending, net worth, or\n\nother financial analysis conducted with respect to former SA Force,” “any and all\n\nphone records relating to former SA Force,” and “bank account records from any\n\nand all bank accounts maintained by former SA Force or his spouse.” App’x 669-\n\n70. The district court concluded that those requests were too broad and\n\nunfocused, and that the information requested was not material in the Rule 16\n\nsense because the defense “has not articulated a coherent and particular reason\n\nwhy” the Force investigation could “counter the government’s case or bolster a\n\ndefense.” Id. at 697. Next, the district court concluded that the Rule 17 subpoenas\n\nwere part of the same overall fishing expedition and that the issuance of such\n\nsubpoenas could compromise the Force grand jury investigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                          73\n\f         There was no abuse of discretion in those rulings. Ulbricht has not shown\n\nthat, had the government produced every piece of requested information, he\n\nwould have been able to alter the quantum of proof in his favor at trial. That is so\n\nbecause there is no indication, beyond Ulbricht’s speculation, that Force\n\nmanufactured any of the evidence on which the government relied at trial, let\n\nalone the most damning evidence discovered on the hard drive on Ulbricht’s\n\nlaptop and at his apartment. Because Force did not testify at trial, information\n\nrelated to his corruption would not have been relevant to attack the credibility of\n\nany testimony he would have given. Moreover, Ulbricht has not identified any\n\nspecific aspect of the trial evidence that he could have undermined using the\n\nrequested information. Thus, even if the district court erred in not granting at\n\nleast some of Ulbricht’s discovery requests, any such error does not justify a new\n\ntrial.\n\n               4. Ulbricht’s Motion to Adjourn the Trial\n\n         Ulbricht contends that the district court erred in denying his request to\n\nadjourn the trial until the Force investigation was complete. “[A] district court\n\nhas a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials.” United States v. Griffiths, 750 F.3d\n\n237, 241 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, “trial courts\n\n\n                                           74\n\fenjoy very broad discretion in granting or denying trial continuances.” United\n\nStates v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013). A decision to grant or deny a\n\nrequest for an adjournment is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and we “will find\n\nno such abuse unless the denial was an arbitrary action that substantially\n\nimpaired the defense.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the party\n\nseeking a continuance has the burden of showing “both arbitrariness and\n\nprejudice in order to obtain reversal” based on a denial of an adjournment. Id. at\n\n128 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ulbricht’s request\n\nfor an adjournment of the trial. In a sealed portion of the proceedings on the first\n\nday of trial, the district court explained its reasons for denying the adjournment.\n\nThe court ruled that because none of the evidence revealed by the government\n\nconcerning Force’s corruption was exculpatory, there was no reason to believe\n\nthat delaying the trial would assist Ulbricht’s defense. That analysis was not\n\nirrational or arbitrary. Moreover, as explained in more detail both above and\n\nbelow, Ulbricht has not shown how information related to Force’s corruption was\n\neither exculpatory or material to his defense. Thus, he has not shown that the\n\n\n\n\n                                          75\n\fdistrict court’s refusal to adjourn the trial was prejudicial, let alone substantially\n\nso.\n\n             5. Preclusion of the DeathFromAbove Chats\n\n      As already described, Force used DeathFromAbove as an unauthorized\n\nSilk Road username through which he attempted to extort money from DPR. The\n\ngovernment only learned of Force’s activity as DeathFromAbove during trial,\n\nwhen the defense attempted to introduce a redacted chat between DPR and\n\nDeathFromAbove. In the chat at issue, DeathFromAbove implied that he knew\n\nthat DPR’s real identity was Anand Athavale. DeathFromAbove then attempted\n\nto blackmail DPR by saying that, if DPR gave him $250,000, he would not “give\n\nyou [sic] identity to law enforcement.” App’x 712.\n\n      The government objected to admitting the chat on three grounds: (1) it was\n\nhearsay; (2) its probative value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice\n\nunder Rule 403, Fed. R. Evid.; and (3) it was a “back-door attempt to re-inject”\n\nForce’s corruption into the defense’s trial evidence. App’x 707. The district court\n\nexcluded the chat as hearsay. At trial, Ulbricht claimed that the chat was not\n\nbeing offered for its truth, but instead to show its effect on DPR; that is, if DPR\n\nwas actually Athavale, one would expect DPR to take certain steps to protect his\n\n\n                                          76\n\fidentity. The district court disagreed and ruled that the DeathFromAbove chat\n\nwas hearsay because it was offered for the truth of the matter asserted\n\ntherein—that government agents at one time thought that Athavale was\n\nDPR—and it did not fall into any hearsay exceptions. In the alternative, the\n\ndistrict court found that the Athavale-as-DPR theory lacked sufficient support,\n\nwas speculative, and risked jury confusion.\n\n      In general, hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies. See Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 802. “The Federal Rules of Evidence define hearsay as a declarant’s\n\nout-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserted in the statement.” United States v. Dupree, 706 F.3d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 2013)\n\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). If “the significance of an\n\noffered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to\n\nthe truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). “The trial court’s ultimate decisions as to the\n\nadmission or exclusion of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion.” Davis v.\n\nVelez, 797 F.3d 192, 201 (2d Cir. 2015).\n\n      The district court concluded that the DeathFromAbove chat was hearsay\n\nbecause it was an out-of-court statement being offered for the truth of the matter\n\n\n                                           77\n\fasserted therein. That ruling was not an abuse of discretion. Contrary to\n\nUlbricht’s assertions on appeal, the district court did not rest its decision on the\n\nneed for grand jury secrecy to protect the Force investigation. Instead, the\n\ndecision was a straightforward application of the rule against hearsay.\n\n      Ulbricht does not provide any detailed arguments to the contrary that are\n\nspecific to the DeathFromAbove chat; instead, he discusses the district court’s\n\npreclusion of all of the evidence related to the Force investigation collectively. At\n\ntrial, however, he claimed that the statement was offered only to demonstrate\n\n“the fact that it was communicated to DPR . . . in that this particular piece of\n\nevidence communicates to DPR the name and profile of the person\n\n[D]eath[F]rom[A]bove believes is DPR.” Tr. 1866. Ulbricht claimed that the\n\nstatement was “offered for the fact that DPR was getting information about\n\npeople who were supposed to be DPR,” and “one of these people is [Athavale].”\n\nId. at 1867. Once the district court expressed skepticism about his argument,\n\nUlbricht claimed that he sought to admit the chat to demonstrate its effect on\n\nDPR: “if you’re DPR and you get a name . . . this Anand Athavale and a profile\n\nand details . . . and you’re put on notice that it’s you, you’re going to take steps.”\n\nId. at 1867-68. In other words, Ulbricht claimed that he did not offer it for the\n\n\n                                          78\n\ftruth of the matter asserted in the chat: that agents in the Baltimore investigation,\n\nincluding Force, believed that Athavale was the real Dread Pirate Roberts, or that\n\nAthavale was in fact the real DPR.\n\n      Ulbricht’s proposed non-hearsay use of the chat—to show its effect on\n\nDPR—is not sufficiently probative that the evidence’s exclusion prejudiced him.\n\nThe statement does not appear to have had an effect on DPR that would bolster\n\nUlbricht’s defense. DPR did not alter his behavior in response to the extortion\n\nattempt. Indeed, he referred to it as “bogus” in one of the journal entries\n\ndiscovered on Ulbricht’s laptop. App’x 710. If Athavale had been the real Dread\n\nPirate Roberts, he likely would have had a different reaction to the threatened\n\nexposure of his identity. DPR’s reactions to other attempts to destroy the site’s\n\nanonymity were dramatic, and included hiring people to kill the users who\n\nthreatened to compromise Silk Road. Therefore, even if Ulbricht did not offer the\n\nchat for its truth, any relevance of the arguably non-hearsay use of the statement\n\nwas entirely too remote to outweigh the possible jury confusion that would result\n\nfrom the injection of Force into the trial or the likelihood that the jury would\n\nconfuse the hearsay and non-hearsay significance of the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         79\n\f             6. Ulbricht’s Rule 33 Motion: Brady v. Maryland\n\n      Ulbricht moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P., raising\n\nseveral issues concerning the unfairness of the assertedly belated disclosures of\n\nthe investigations into Force and Bridges.45 The only argument that he pursues in\n\nthis appeal is that the belated disclosures violated his due process rights under\n\nBrady because the information was both material and exculpatory.\n\n      Rule 33(a) provides that, on “the defendant’s motion, the court may vacate\n\nany judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” We have\n\nadvised district courts to “exercise Rule 33 authority sparingly and in the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances.” United States v. Coté, 544 F.3d 88, 101 (2d Cir. 2008)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “Where a defendant’s Brady claim was raised\n\nin a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33[,] . . . we review the denial of the\n\nmotion for abuse of discretion.” United States v. Douglas, 525 F.3d 225, 245 (2d Cir.\n\n2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of denying a Rule 33\n\nmotion, a “district court abuses . . . the discretion accorded to it when (1) its\n\n\n\n45\n  Ulbricht filed his Rule 33 motion on March 6, 2015. The criminal complaint\nagainst Force and Bridges was unsealed on March 30, which is the first time that\nUlbricht learned that Bridges was corrupt and was involved in the case.\n\n\n                                          80\n\fdecision rests on an error of law . . . or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or (2)\n\nits decision—though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly\n\nerroneous factual finding—cannot be located within the range of permissible\n\ndecisions.” United States v. Forbes, 790 F.3d 403, 406 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       There are three components of a Brady violation: “(1) The evidence at issue\n\nmust be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or because it is\n\nimpeaching; (2) that evidence must have been suppressed by the [government],\n\neither willfully or inadvertently; and (3) prejudice must have ensued.” United\n\nStates v. Certified Envtl. Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 91 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Information is exculpatory if it relates to the\n\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence. United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir.\n\n1998). In order to show that he has been prejudiced, a defendant must\n\ndemonstrate “a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different, such that the failure to\n\ndisclose undermines confidence in the verdict.” Certified Envtl. Servs., Inc., 753\n\nF.3d at 91 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Thus, the\n\nprosecution “must disclose . . . exculpatory and impeachment information no\n\n\n                                            81\n\flater than the point at which a reasonable probability will exist that the outcome\n\nwould have been different if an earlier disclosure had been made.” Id. at 92\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In general, a “prudent prosecutor will err on\n\nthe side of transparency, resolving doubtful questions in favor of disclosure.”\n\nCone v. Bell, 556 U.S. 449, 470 n.15 (2009).\n\n      Although the agents’ illegal behavior in connection with the Silk Road\n\ninvestigation is deeply troubling, the government’s December 2014 disclosure of\n\nthe Force investigation and the post-trial disclosure of Bridges’s corruption did\n\nnot violate Ulbricht’s due process rights. Evidence concerning the agents’\n\ncorruption is not Brady information because it is not exculpatory or impeaching\n\nof the government’s trial evidence. For this reason, the government’s failure to\n\nreveal the full extent of the investigations until after Ulbricht’s trial did not\n\nprejudice him. As already explained, the fact that Force purloined Bitcoins from\n\nSilk Road and attempted to blackmail DPR does not relate to Ulbricht’s guilt or\n\ninnocence; the same logic applies to Bridges’s similar behavior. The agents’\n\ncorruption has nothing to do with whether Ulbricht operated the site as Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. Ulbricht has not raised any credible doubts about the reliability of\n\nthe evidence that the government presented at trial, nor has he explained why\n\n\n                                           82\n\fthe agents’ illegal actions relate to his guilt at all. Indeed, the government\n\nremoved from its exhibit list the items relevant to Force, including\n\ncommunications between Nob (his authorized undercover username) and DPR.\n\nThose communications included an instance in which DPR hired Nob to kill\n\nCurtis Green (Flush) as punishment for using his administrator status to steal\n\nBitcoins from Silk Road users. Ulbricht does not identify any particular evidence\n\nintroduced by the government at trial that is traceable to either Force or Bridges,\n\nor the admissibility of which depends on either agent’s integrity.\n\n      Ulbricht’s arguments to the contrary largely rest on speculation. First,\n\nUlbricht contends that the Silk Road investigations occurring in Baltimore and\n\nNew York were “[c]oordinated and [c]ombined,” suggesting that Force’s\n\ncorruption may have somehow infected the evidence that the New York office\n\nused in its prosecution. Appellant Br. 40. Ulbricht explains that the offices\n\ncommunicated frequently and shared information through emails and reports.\n\nAssuming that Ulbricht is correct, the fact that the Silk Road investigation took\n\nplace in several offices, one of which employed two corrupt agents, does not alter\n\nour analysis. Ulbricht still has not shown how the agents’ corrupt behavior is\n\nexculpatory as to him, even if Force and Bridges at times shared their work\n\n\n                                          83\n\fproduct with New York and that work product influenced the larger\n\ninvestigation. The relevant question, on which none of Ulbricht’s arguments casts\n\nany light or raises any doubt, is whether any particular item of evidence was\n\ntainted in some way by the misconduct of Bridges or Force.\n\n      Next, Ulbricht surmises that the agents may have fabricated evidence\n\nsuggesting that Ulbricht was DPR. In so arguing, Ulbricht implies that Force and\n\nBridges may have had sufficiently high-level administrator access to Silk Road to\n\nmanipulate the “financial, transactional, and communications infrastructure of\n\nthe Silk Road site.” Reply Br. 14. Nothing in the government’s disclosures, and\n\nnothing that Ulbricht identifies in the record or has produced from any\n\nindependent source, suggests that either Bridges or Force had such capacity.\n\nAbsent further detail or evidence that Force and Bridges were able to infiltrate\n\nDPR’s communications or transactions, Ulbricht’s argument is simply too\n\nspeculative to warrant a new trial. Ulbricht further claims that Bridges used\n\nsophisticated techniques to try to place blame on others for his corrupt conduct,\n\nreflecting a pattern of framing others for his own crimes. That fact alone does not\n\nsuggest that Bridges fabricated any evidence against Ulbricht or attempted to\n\nframe him. That Bridges undertook to deflect blame for things he had done does\n\n\n                                        84\n\fnot suggest any reason why Bridges would be motivated to frame Ulbricht for\n\nthings that DPR had done. Nor does Ulbricht explain how Bridges’s actions\n\nshould undermine our confidence in any of the specific evidence on which the\n\ngovernment relied at trial.46\n\n      Finally, Ulbricht submitted a supplemental appendix that included a\n\nnewly-discovered, unredacted report from the Joint Automated Booking System\n\n(“JABS”).47 In that report, under the heading “Arrested or Received Information,”\n\nForce is listed as the officer on the case, and the Baltimore DEA is listed as the\n\nrelevant agency. Ulbricht apparently means to suggest that this report shows that\n\nForce played a more pervasive role in the investigation than the government has\n\nacknowledged. In response, the government argues that Force was simply the\n\n\n\n\n46\n  In a footnote, Ulbricht claims that failing to disclose the full extent of the\nagents’ corruption deprived him of an opportunity to “attack[] the investigation\nas shoddy.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 442 n.13 (1995). Now that he has all of\nthe relevant information, he still does not explain how he might have\ndemonstrated deficiencies in the government’s investigation of his or one of the\nother initial suspects’ conduct that would undermine our confidence in the\nverdict.\n47\n  As the government explains, and Ulbricht does not dispute, JABS is a database\nmaintained by the United States Marshals Service that catalogues information\nregarding alleged offenders who have been arrested and booked by federal, state,\nor local law enforcement agencies.\n\n                                          85\n\fmost recent person to make changes to the JABS report by updating it to include\n\ninformation about Ulbricht’s family members and the pending charges in\n\nMaryland. In any event, the JABS report bearing Force’s name does not show\n\nhow information related to Force’s corruption exculpates Ulbricht. It merely\n\nconfirms that Force was a participant in the Baltimore Silk Road investigation\n\nand that he continued to be involved in the case after Ulbricht was arrested. In\n\nthe face of the entire record of the trial, in which the provenance of the\n\ngovernment’s evidence was exhaustively displayed without indication that Force\n\nwas responsible for any of it, this single report has little or no probative value.\n\n      In sum, we conclude that the Force and Bridges complaint did not contain\n\nBrady information because the agents’ corruption does not bear on Ulbricht’s\n\nguilt or innocence. Thus, any delay in the government’s disclosure of their\n\ncorruption did not violate Ulbricht’s due process rights.\n\n      B. Preclusion of Defense Experts\n\n      The district court precluded both of Ulbricht’s proposed expert witnesses\n\nfrom testifying because he did not timely or adequately disclose his intent to call\n\nthem under Rule 16, Fed. R. Crim. P. In general, the “defendant must, at the\n\ngovernment’s request, give to the government a written summary of any [expert]\n\n\n                                          86\n\ftestimony that a defendant intends to use. . . . This summary must describe the\n\nwitness’s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s\n\nqualifications.”48 Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). The purpose of the expert\n\ndisclosure requirement is to “minimize surprise that often results from\n\nunexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide\n\nthe opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s testimony\n\nthrough focused cross-examination.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, advisory committee’s\n\nnote to 1993 amendment. Indeed, “[w]ith increased use of both scientific and\n\nnonscientific expert testimony, one of counsel’s most basic discovery needs is to\n\nlearn that an expert is expected to testify.” Id.\n\n      If a party fails to comply with Rule 16, the district court has “broad\n\ndiscretion in fashioning a remedy,” which may include granting a continuance or\n\n“ordering the exclusion of evidence.” United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d 145, 158 (2d\n\nCir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2)(A)-(D)\n\n(a district court may order “any other [remedy] that is just under the\n\ncircumstances”). We thus review the district court’s choice of remedy for abuse of\n\n\n\n48\n  It is undisputed that the government requested such disclosure on December\n29, 2014, two weeks before trial began.\n\n                                           87\n\fdiscretion. “In considering whether the district court abused its discretion, we\n\nlook to the reasons why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if\n\nany, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a\n\ncontinuance, and any other relevant circumstances.” Lee, 834 F.3d at 159 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the defense\n\nfrom calling its proposed experts. Not only were the disclosures late, more\n\nimportantly, they were plainly inadequate. Both disclosures merely listed general\n\nand in some cases extremely broad topics on which the experts might opine. For\n\nexample, the disclosures indicated that the experts would testify on general\n\ntopics, including: “the origins of Bitcoin,” “the various purposes and uses of\n\nBitcoin,” “the mechanics of Bitcoin transactions,” “the value of Bitcoin over time\n\nsince its inception,” “the concepts of Bitcoin speculating and Bitcoin mining,”\n\n“[g]eneral principles of internet security and vulnerabilities,” the “import of\n\nsome lines of PHP code provided to defense counsel in discovery,” and\n\n“[g]eneral principles of public-key cryptography,” among others. App’x 349, 360.\n\nThey did not summarize the experts’ opinions about those topics, let alone\n\ndescribe the bases for the experts’ opinions.\n\n\n                                          88\n\f      Indeed, although the listed topics certainly pertained generally to Silk\n\nRoad, the disclosures were so vague that it is difficult to discern whether the\n\nproffered expert testimony would have been at all relevant under Rules 401 and\n\n702(a), Fed. R. Evid.49 In his opposition to the government’s motion to preclude\n\nAntonopoulos, Ulbricht described the expert’s proposed testimony in more\n\ndetail, but he still did not disclose the opinions that the expert intended to offer.\n\nFor example, that supplemental disclosure indicated that an “[i]ndependent\n\ndefense investigation has uncovered that” the government’s claim that over\n\n700,000 Bitcoins were transferred to Ulbricht’s Bitcoin wallet “is implausible,”\n\nand the expert would “dispute this finding.” App’x 382. Although that is more\n\nspecific, it is not a summary of Antonopoulos’s opinion, nor does it identify the\n\nbasis for that opinion. Thus, to this day Ulbricht has not described what opinions\n\n\n\n49\n  In particular, Ulbricht’s disclosures did not discuss, and he has not described\non appeal, how one expert’s proposed testimony on “[g]eneral principles of\ninternet security and vulnerabilities” would have linked to the defense claim that\nthe damning documentary evidence of Ulbricht’s guilt found on his laptop was\nor could have been fabricated or planted. The jury was aware from other\nevidence, and indeed it is within ordinary lay experience, that various forms of\nhacking are possible. What was lacking, what the defense expert disclosures did\nnot purport to address, and what Ulbricht still has not provided on appeal, is any\nexplanation, let alone a credible explanation, of how the breadth and variety of\ninformation, from the laptop and other sources, could have been planted.\n\n                                          89\n\fthe experts would offer or explained the methods they used to arrive at any of\n\nthose conclusions.\n\n      The district court also did not abuse its discretion in finding that the\n\ngovernment would be prejudiced by the belated and inadequate disclosures, in\n\npart because the government was due to rest the following day, providing it with\n\nno time to prepare to respond to the experts. Moreover, the district court\n\nconsidered intermediate sanctions short of preclusion but found them to be\n\ninadequate. In rejecting a continuance as a possible remedy, the district court\n\nemphasized the “known issues with a continuance,” especially in a lengthy trial.\n\nId. at 369. Two of the jurors had time constraints, and a continuance might have\n\ncaused the court to lose one or both of those jurors, especially if the continuance\n\nwas lengthy. If it were to grant a continuance, the court would also need to\n\nperform its function as a gatekeeper of expert testimony under Daubert v. Merrell\n\nDow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 592-93 (1993), which requires the district court to\n\nmake a “preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology\n\nunderlying the [expert] testimony is scientifically valid” and “can be applied to\n\n\n\n\n                                         90\n\fthe facts in issue.”50 The district court cannot perform that complex evaluation of\n\nan expert’s proposed methodology without a clear articulation of what the\n\nexpert’s opinions are and, even more importantly, of the bases for those opinions.\n\nIn light of the risk of losing jurors and the lack of a sufficiently compelling reason\n\nfor the defense’s clear violation of Rule 16, the district court was within its\n\ndiscretion when it determined that a continuance was not practical and that the\n\nappropriate remedy was to preclude the witnesses altogether.\n\n      Ulbricht’s arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, Ulbricht\n\nargues that the two experts were necessary to rebut portions of the government’s\n\ncase that he was precluded from addressing during cross-examination, as well as\n\nthe testimony of Ilhwan Yum, a government witness who analyzed transactions\n\n\n\n50\n  We have explained that a Daubert reliability assessment requires a district court\nto consider the “extent to which [the expert’s theory] has been subjected to peer\nreview and publication,” whether the technique is “subject to standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation,” the “known or potential rate of error,”\nand the “degree of acceptance within the relevant scientific community.” United\nStates v. Romano, 794 F.3d 317, 330 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That inquiry is a “flexible one,” however, and Daubert is not a\n“definitive checklist or test” for the reliability of expert testimony. Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, “[w]hether Daubert’s specific factors are, or are\nnot, reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case is a matter that the law\ngrants the trial judge broad latitude to determine.” Id. at 331 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n                                          91\n\fassociated with Bitcoin wallets found on Ulbricht’s laptop. Ulbricht now\n\ncontends that portions of Yum’s testimony were incorrect, including his\n\ndescription of what a “hot” Bitcoin wallet is.51 Ulbricht does not, however,\n\nexplain how Yum’s testimony was incorrect, what contrary evidence his experts\n\nwould have provided had they been allowed to testify, or how any purported\n\ncorrection of Yum’s testimony would have affected the case against Ulbricht. Nor\n\nhas he produced any summaries of his proposed expert testimony or described\n\nhow that testimony would have been material to Ulbricht’s guilt or innocence. In\n\nother words, Ulbricht has not shown that precluding Bellovin and Antonopoulos\n\nfrom testifying prejudiced him. Ulbricht’s alternative argument that the\n\ndisclosures were in fact adequate is incorrect for the reasons already explained.\n\n      Ulbricht next argues that preclusion was an unduly harsh remedy under\n\nthe circumstances. Along those lines, he claims that certain exhibits, such as the\n\nsummary chart on which Yum relied, were not produced until mid-trial. Thus,\n\n\n51\n  “The terms hot wallet and cold wallet derive from the more general terms hot\nstorage, meaning online storage, and cold storage, meaning offline storage. A hot\nwallet is a Bitcoin wallet for which the private keys are stored on a network-\nconnected machine (i.e.[,] in hot storage). By contrast, for a cold wallet the private\nkeys are stored offline.” Steven Goldfeder et al., Securing Bitcoin Wallets via a New\nDSA/ECDSA Threshold Signature Scheme, Princeton University 10, available at\nhttp://www.cs.princeton.edu/~stevenag/threshold_sigs.pdf.\n\n                                          92\n\faccording to Ulbricht, he could not have known about his need for expert\n\nwitnesses to counter specific trial exhibits until it was already too late to comply\n\nwith Rule 16. In his view, the district court should not have held him so strictly to\n\nRule 16’s requirements because he could not have known until Yum testified that\n\nhe would need to call an expert.\n\n      While Ulbricht is correct that excluding his experts was a harsh sanction\n\nand was not to be imposed lightly, the district court considered the possibility of\n\ngranting a continuance or a more limited sanction and found those remedies to\n\nbe inappropriate under the circumstances. Such careful consideration of a range\n\nof possible sanctions short of preclusion is especially important in the atypical\n\ncase where a criminal defendant, rather than the government, is precluded from\n\nputting on his case because of a Rule 16 violation. Limiting the defense’s\n\npresentation of his case implicates the fundamental right of “an accused to\n\npresent witnesses in his own defense.” Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302\n\n(1973). However, the defendant must still “comply with established rules of\n\nprocedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the\n\nascertainment of guilt and innocence.” Id. Here, Ulbricht did not comply with the\n\nprocedural requirements associated with expert disclosures. The district court\n\n\n                                         93\n\fgave the issue due consideration and appropriately exercised its discretion in\n\nremedying the defense’s Rule 16 violation.\n\n      Finally, Ulbricht cannot credibly argue that Yum’s testimony was the first\n\nnotice he had about the possible need for an expert witness to testify as part of\n\nhis affirmative case. The Silk Road prosecution was uniquely laden with issues\n\nrelated to technology, computer servers, forensics, cyber security, digital\n\ncurrency, and myriad other issues that are indisputably “beyond the ken of the\n\naverage juror.” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d 179, 191 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Ulbricht surely knew from the outset that, in order to\n\nmount a meaningful attack on the government’s voluminous and technically\n\ncomplex evidence, he would need to call his own expert. Indeed, in his opening\n\nstatement, Ulbricht’s counsel claimed that he would show that the Bitcoins in\n\nUlbricht’s wallet were from innocent transactions associated with Bitcoin\n\nspeculation, rather than, as the government contended, related to Silk Road.52\n\n\n\n\n52\n  No evidence about the source of those Bitcoins was in fact presented by\nUlbricht, and neither the expert disclosures presented to the district court nor\nUlbricht’s arguments on appeal suggest that either Bellovin or Antonopoulos\nwould have provided an analysis or explanation of Ulbricht’s Bitcoin transactions\nthat would have revealed a non-Silk Road source for Ulbricht’s Bitcoins.\n\n                                          94\n\fUlbricht’s opening statement also implied that BitTorrent’s53 security deficiencies\n\ncould have allowed the true DPR to plant incriminating evidence on his laptop. It\n\nis difficult to fathom how he planned to advance those theories without relying\n\non expert testimony.\n\n      In short, Ulbricht argues that the district court’s preclusion of his proffered\n\nexpert witnesses denied him a fair opportunity to present his defense. But the\n\nsame failings that render Ulbricht’s expert disclosures inadequate under Rule 16\n\npreclude us from finding the kind of prejudice he asserts. Ulbricht did not\n\ndisclose to the district court, and has not presented on appeal, any explanation of\n\nwhat the proposed experts would have said that would have supported a non-\n\nspeculative basis for doubting the probative value of evidence from a variety of\n\nelectronic and other sources identifying Ulbricht as DPR throughout the life of\n\nSilk Road. Thus, we cannot conclude that he was prejudiced by the experts’\n\nexclusion.\n\n\n\n\n53\n BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing service that is used to transfer large files\nwithout disrupting Internet servers. It has both legitimate and illicit purposes. See\nNext Phase Distribution, Inc. v. John Does 1-27, 284 F.R.D. 165, 167 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).\n\n                                          95\n\f      C. Curtailing Cross-Examination\n\n      Ulbricht contends that the district court erred in limiting his ability to\n\ncross-examine two government witnesses: Der-Yeghiayan and Kiernan. “We\n\nreview a trial court’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.” United States v. Cedeno, 644 F.3d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 2011). “A district court\n\nis accorded broad discretion in controlling the scope and extent of cross-\n\nexamination.” United States v. James, 712 F.3d 79, 103 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see Fed. R. Evid. 611(a). Thus, “a district court may\n\nimpose reasonable limits on cross-examination to protect against, e.g.,\n\nharassment, prejudice, confusion, and waste.” James, 712 F.3d at 103 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). In general, however, a “district court should afford\n\nwide latitude to a defendant in a criminal case to cross-examine government\n\nwitnesses.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). That is so because the\n\nConfrontation Clause gives “a defendant the right not only to cross-examination,\n\nbut to effective cross-examination.” Id. “[I]t does not follow, of course, that the\n\nConfrontation Clause prevents a trial judge from imposing any limits” on defense\n\ncounsel’s cross-examination of government witnesses. Id. (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n\n                                          96\n\f             1. Agent Der-Yeghiayan\n\n      Ulbricht argues that the district court erred when it struck portions of Der-\n\nYeghiayan’s testimony that referenced his prior belief that Karpeles might be\n\nDread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht also challenges the striking of a similar but\n\nanalytically distinct piece of testimony: Der-Yeghiayan’s statement that\n\nKarpeles’s attorney had offered information about Silk Road in exchange for\n\nKarpeles receiving immunity from prosecution. Ulbricht wanted the jury to infer\n\nthat Karpeles had some criminal involvement in Silk Road that motivated him to\n\npursue a cooperation agreement with the government.\n\n      Der-Yeghiayan answered the defendant’s initial questions about those\n\ntopics, and the government did not object to them until a later side bar. During\n\nthe side bar, the district court expressed its initial view that the questions were\n\nproper, but requested written briefing on the subject. After reviewing the parties’\n\nsubmissions, the district court agreed with the government that neither Der-\n\nYeghiayan’s prior opinions about whether Karpeles was DPR nor Karpeles’s\n\noffer of information about Silk Road was relevant to Ulbricht’s case. The court\n\nthus directed the government to identify portions of Der-Yeghiayan’s testimony\n\n\n\n\n                                          97\n\fto strike. After the government identified the improper testimony, the district\n\ncourt gave a general limiting instruction to the jury:\n\n             You heard testimony while Mr. Der-Yeghiayan was on\n             the stand regarding personal beliefs or suspicions he\n             may have had about particular individuals at various\n             points during his investigation. And I instruct you that\n             what the agent suspected about others isn’t evidence\n             and should be disregarded. Now, consistent with all of\n             the instructions I’m going to give you at the end of the\n             case, there was other testimony that Mr. Der-Yeghiayan\n             provided which you may consider during your\n             deliberations and give it the weight that you deem that\n             it deserves. So it’s the suspicions, all right?\n\nTr. 974. Ulbricht contends on appeal that the district court erred in striking the\n\ntestimony.\n\n      We disagree. The district court did not err in concluding that Der-\n\nYeghiayan’s prior beliefs about Karpeles as a possible DPR suspect were not\n\nrelevant to the charges against Ulbricht. In order to elicit testimony implicating\n\nan alternative perpetrator, a defendant “must show that his proffered evidence\n\non the alleged alternative perpetrator is sufficient, on its own or in combination\n\nwith other evidence in the record, to show a nexus between the crime charged\n\nand the asserted alternative perpetrator.” Wade v. Mantello, 333 F.3d 51, 61-62 (2d\n\nCir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to avoid a “grave risk of jury\n\n\n                                         98\n\fconfusion,” a defendant must offer more than “unsupported speculation that\n\nanother person may have done the crime.” Id. at 62 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). An “agent’s state of mind as the investigation progressed is ordinarily\n\nof little or no relevance to the question of the defendant[’s] guilt.” United States v.\n\nJohnson, 529 F.3d 493, 501 (2d Cir. 2008). Thus, striking Der-Yeghiayan’s\n\ntestimony and instructing the jury to disregard his earlier opinions about\n\nKarpeles’s possible guilt was not error.54\n\n      Further, any arguable error that occurred was harmless. Defense counsel\n\ncontinued to cross-examine Der-Yeghiayan and elicited admissible testimony\n\nabout the earlier investigation into Karpeles; indeed, the district court took over\n\ncross-examination at several points to assist the defense in asking proper\n\nquestions. Cf. Cotto v. Herbert, 331 F.3d 217, 254 (2d Cir. 2003) (in considering\n\n\n\n54\n  Ulbricht also contends on appeal that the government’s objection to the\ntestimony, which occurred at a later sidebar, was untimely. He cites no law in\nsupport of that argument. In general, an “objection should be made after the\nquestion has been asked but before an answer has been given.” Hutchinson v.\nGroskin, 927 F.2d 722, 725 (2d Cir. 1991). That “rule is not inflexible,” id., however,\nand we do not “necessarily find [a]n objection affirmatively waived because it\nmight have been interposed a few questions earlier,” United States v.\nPujana-Mena, 949 F.2d 24, 33 (2d Cir. 1991). Thus, although a contemporaneous\nobjection is preferable, the district court was within its discretion to sustain the\nlater objection and strike the testimony.\n\n                                          99\n\fwhether a Confrontation Clause violation is harmless, we consider, inter alia, “the\n\nextent of cross-examination otherwise permitted”). Moreover, Ulbricht discussed\n\nthe investigation of Karpeles in his summation without objection. What was\n\nrelevant at trial was any actual evidence pointing to Karpeles as the true Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. The district court did not limit Ulbricht’s cross-examination of\n\nDer-Yeghiayan as to his knowledge of such evidence. The district court directed\n\nthe jury to disregard only testimony as to the agent’s “suspicions,” Tr. 974, a\n\nsubject of “little or no relevance to . . . the defendant[’s] guilt,” Johnson, 529 F.3d\n\nat 501.\n\n      We similarly reject Ulbricht’s contention that striking Der-Yeghiayan’s\n\ntestimony concerning Karpeles’s offer to provide information about Silk Road in\n\nexchange for immunity was an abuse of discretion. Absent other evidence in the\n\nrecord regarding Karpeles, it was proper to exclude wholly speculative\n\nsuggestions of an alternative perpetrator defense based on Karpeles’s attorney’s\n\noffer of information in exchange for his client’s immunity. And even assuming,\n\narguendo, that the district court erred in striking the testimony, any error was\n\nharmless. To the extent this testimony was stricken from the trial record, that\n\nruling occurred outside the presence of the jury. All the jury was told was to\n\n\n                                           100\n\fdisregard testimony about “what the agent suspected about others,” Tr. 974, a\n\ncategory that hardly would be understood by the jury to encompass testimony\n\nabout the actions of Karpeles’s attorney. As explained in detail above, moreover,\n\nthe evidence identifying Ulbricht as Dread Pirate Roberts was overwhelming and\n\nlargely unchallenged. That Karpeles may have had information about Silk Road\n\ndoes not imply that he was DPR, only that he had some knowledge of or\n\ninvolvement with the site. Particularly given that Karpeles likely had some\n\nknowledge about Silk Road simply because of his operation of Mt. Gox, a\n\nprominent Bitcoin exchanger, any marginal probative value in the fact that he\n\nclaimed to have such knowledge, and offered to provide it to the government,\n\ncould not have meaningfully affected the balance of evidence available to the jury\n\nregarding the identity of DPR.\n\n            2. Agent Kiernan\n\n      Defense counsel cross-examined Kiernan extensively, and Ulbricht\n\ncontends on appeal that the district court erred in preventing him from exploring\n\ncertain topics during that cross-examination. Those excluded topics include: the\n\n\n\n\n                                       101\n\fmeaning of various acronyms, the significance of a certain line of PHP code,55\n\nwhether the FBI allowed Kiernan to run BitTorrent on his work computer despite\n\nits lack of security, and whether the Linux kernel56 that Kiernan used on his work\n\ncomputer was the same as the one that Ulbricht installed on his laptop. Ulbricht\n\nexplains that he was attempting to show that Kiernan’s conclusions about\n\nUlbricht’s laptop were inaccurate because they were based on unreliable\n\ninformation.\n\n      The district court sustained objections to those questions because, in its\n\nview, they were outside the scope of Kiernan’s direct testimony. See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n611(b) (“Cross-examination should not go beyond the subject matter of the direct\n\nexamination and matters affecting the witness’s credibility.”); Baker v. Goldman\n\nSachs & Co., 669 F.3d 105, 110 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Once any direct examination is\n\nconcluded, cross-examination within the scope of the direct follows.”).\n\n      On appeal, Ulbricht claims that, because Kiernan testified about the\n\noperation of Tor Chat and other forensic computer issues during his direct\n\n\n55\n PHP is a common computer programming language that is used primarily in\nwebsite development.\n56\n  A kernel is an operating system’s core, and it “is an essential part of the Linux\noperating system.” Tr. 1070.\n\n                                        102\n\ftestimony, the precluded questions were within that testimony’s scope and\n\nshould have been allowed. Even assuming that Ulbricht is correct, any error is\n\nharmless. Ulbricht was permitted to question Kiernan about whether Linux was\n\ncustomizable, and Kiernan admitted during cross that he did not know whether\n\nhe used the same version of Tor Chat that Ulbricht had installed on his laptop.\n\nUlbricht’s counsel also asked several questions about the security vulnerabilities\n\nof BitTorrent, conveying to the jury that using BitTorrent might have rendered\n\nUlbricht’s computer susceptible to hacking. Thus, Ulbricht was able to elicit\n\ntestimony supporting his proposed inference that Kiernan’s conclusions based on\n\nthe Tor Chat evidence were flawed. Ulbricht does not explain how he was\n\nprejudiced when the district court prohibited him from asking Kiernan certain\n\nother questions. We therefore identify no reversible error in the district court’s\n\nlimitations on Kiernan’s cross examination.\n\n      D. Andrew Jones Hearsay Statement\n\n      The district court excluded a statement allegedly made by Andrew Jones,\n\nwho was a Silk Road administrator under the username Inigo. Jones cooperated\n\nwith the government and was on the government’s witness list until the middle\n\nof trial, when the government decided not to call him. Defense counsel explored\n\n\n                                         103\n\fthe possibility of calling Jones as a witness, but Jones’s attorney advised Ulbricht\n\nthat Jones would invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify if compelled\n\nto appear. In light of Jones’s unavailability, Ulbricht sought to admit a December\n\n29, 2014 letter from the government to defense counsel that described a statement\n\nthat Jones made during one of his interviews.57 The relevant portion of the\n\ngovernment’s letter is as follows:\n\n             At some point in or about August or September 2013,\n             Jones tried to authenticate that the Silk Road user\n             “Dread Pirate Roberts” whom he was talking to at the\n             time . . . was the same person with whom he had been\n             communicating in the past with this username.\n             Previously, . . . Jones and “Dread Pirate Roberts” had\n             agreed upon a “handshake” to use for authentication, in\n             which Jones would provide a certain prompt and\n             “Dread Pirate Roberts” would provide a certain\n             response. When, during the 2013 chat in question, Jones\n             provided what he believed to be the designated prompt,\n             “Dread Pirate Roberts” was unable to provide the\n             response Jones thought they had agreed on. However,\n             later in the chat, Jones asked “Dread Pirate Roberts” to\n             validate himself by specifying the first job that “Dread\n             Pirate Roberts” assigned to him (running the “DPR\n             Book Club”), which “Dread Pirate Roberts” was able to\n             do.\n\n\n\n\n57\n  The government did not concede that the statement was Brady information, but\ndisclosed it “in an abundance of caution.” App’x 398.\n\n                                        104\n\fApp’x 398. Ulbricht argues that the Jones statement58 supports his theory that\n\nmore than one person acted as Dread Pirate Roberts, because at one point DPR\n\ncould authenticate his identity to Jones, but at another time he could not.\n\n      When it became clear that Jones was unavailable to testify, Ulbricht asked\n\nthe government to stipulate that the Jones statement could be read to the jury.\n\nThe government initially agreed, but then changed its mind and opposed\n\nadmitting the Jones statement. The defense acknowledged that the statement was\n\nhearsay, but claimed that it was admissible under two hearsay exceptions: under\n\nRule 804(b)(3), Fed. R. Evid., as a statement against interest, and under Rule 807’s\n\nresidual exception. The district court ruled that the statement was inadmissible,\n\nspecifically addressing only Rule 804(b)(3). On appeal, Ulbricht continues to\n\nargue that the statement was admissible under either exception. Neither of his\n\ntheories is persuasive.59\n\n\n58\n  What Ulbricht sought to introduce was the government’s letter paraphrasing a\nstatement made by Jones during an interview, not a verbatim transcript of what\nJones had said. We refer to it as the “Jones statement” for the sake of simplicity.\n59\n  We note that the Jones statement is double hearsay, in that the defense sought\nto admit the government’s subsequent characterization of Jones’s interview, and\nboth the government’s letter and Jones’s statement to the agents were out of\ncourt statements offered for their truth. When confronted with “hearsay within\nhearsay, or double hearsay,” courts must determine that “each part of the\n\n                                        105\n\f      A district court’s “ultimate decisions as to the admission or exclusion of\n\nevidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion, and will not be disturbed unless\n\nthey are manifestly erroneous.” Davis, 797 F.3d at 201 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citations omitted). To invoke the 804(b)(3) exception for a statement against\n\ninterest, the proponent of the statement “must show (1) that the declarant is\n\nunavailable as a witness, (2) that the statement is sufficiently reliable to warrant\n\nan inference that a reasonable man in [the declarant’s] position would not have\n\nmade the statement unless he believed it to be true, and (3) that corroborating\n\ncircumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.” United States\n\nv. Wexler, 522 F.3d 194, 202 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\nexception applies “only if the district court determines that a reasonable person\n\nin the declarant’s shoes would perceive the statement as detrimental to his or her\n\nown penal interest.” United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 231 (2d Cir. 2004). The\n\nkey to this inquiry is whether the statement is sufficiently “self-inculpatory,”\n\n\n\n\ncombined statement[]” is independently admissible. United States v. Williams, 927\nF.2d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 1991). Because we conclude that no hearsay exception\napplied to the Jones statement at all, we need not address the double hearsay\nissue.\n\n                                         106\n\fwhich the district court must evaluate on a “case-by-case basis.” United States v.\n\nWilliams, 506 F.3d 151, 155 (2d Cir. 2007).\n\n      The district court did not err in concluding that the Jones statement did not\n\nfall within Rule 804(b)(3)’s hearsay exception. There is no dispute that Jones was\n\nunavailable to testify because he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege. The court ruled that the Rule 804(b)(3) exception did not apply because\n\nJones was under a cooperation agreement at the time that he made the relevant\n\nstatement to the government and the chat did not have any particular impact on\n\nJones’s penal interests. On appeal, Ulbricht claims that the extent of Jones’s\n\ncriminal liability was unknown when he made the statement because he could\n\nstill be vulnerable to prosecution in other jurisdictions, and he had not yet been\n\nsentenced when he made the statement to the government. See Mitchell v. United\n\nStates, 526 U.S. 314, 326 (1999) (in the Fifth Amendment context, there can be a\n\n“legitimate fear of adverse consequences from further testimony” where a\n\nsentence has not yet been imposed).\n\n      We are not persuaded that Jones’s statement was against his penal\n\ninterests. Given the cooperation agreement, the government’s role at Jones’s\n\nfuture sentencing, and the penalties for lying to the government, it is far from\n\n\n                                         107\n\fclear that it was against Jones’s interest to disclose details of his criminal activities\n\nat the time the statement in question was made. Moreover, even to the extent that\n\nJones’s disclosures taken as a whole constituted inculpatory admissions, the\n\nparticular statement in question had little adverse effect on Jones. Jones’s\n\ninculpatory admissions to the government concern whether he committed crimes\n\nconnected to Silk Road. His description of his “handshake” with DPR\n\npresupposes that he had already discussed his own crimes with the government.\n\nWhether DPR did or did not recognize Jones’s identifying prompt does not bear\n\non Jones’s guilt of any crime associated with the site, since he had already\n\nconfirmed his role working for DPR. The details of this conversation with DPR\n\nthus do not inculpate Jones; instead, they either help or hurt Ulbricht.\n\nAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Rule\n\n804(b)(3) does not apply.\n\n      Rule 807 provides for a limited, residual exception to the rule against\n\nhearsay where no other exception applies. A hearsay statement may be\n\nadmissible under Rule 807 if: “(i) it is particularly trustworthy; (ii) it bears on a\n\nmaterial fact; (iii) it is the most probative evidence addressing that fact; (iv) its\n\nadmission is consistent with the rules of evidence and advances the interests of\n\n\n                                          108\n\fjustice; and (v) its proffer follows adequate notice to the adverse party.” United\n\nStates v. Morgan, 385 F.3d 196, 208 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The “residual hearsay exception[] will be used very rarely, and only in\n\nexceptional circumstances.” Parsons v. Honeywell, Inc., 929 F.2d 901, 907 (2d Cir.\n\n1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The district court did not specifically address Ulbricht’s request to admit\n\nthe statement under Rule 807, but we conclude that the limited residual exception\n\ndoes not assist Ulbricht. We are loath to assume that a statement made by a\n\ncriminal in debriefings to the government pursuant to a cooperation agreement is\n\ncategorically “particularly trustworthy,” as Rule 807 requires. But even if Jones’s\n\nstatement meets that criterion, and was offered “as evidence of a material fact,”\n\nwe cannot say that it is “more probative on the point for which it is offered than\n\nany other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 807(a)(2)-(3). Ulbricht has not attempted to explain how the Jones\n\nstatement satisfies this requirement.\n\n      Finally, even if the district court erred in excluding the statement under\n\neither hearsay exception, any error was certainly harmless. The conversation\n\nbetween Jones and DPR in its totality was not actually helpful to Ulbricht. As\n\n\n                                        109\n\fexplained, during the chat in question, DPR was at one point unable to provide\n\nthe designated response, but later he identified himself to Jones’s satisfaction.\n\nThe statement thus contains the seeds of its own refutation. Since DPR’s alleged\n\nfailure to verify his identity and his subsequent remedy of that failure occurred\n\nduring the same online chat, the interaction provides little or no support for the\n\ndefense theory that different individuals acted as DPR at different times.\n\n      E. Cumulative Error\n\n      Ulbricht argues that the cumulative effect of the district court’s evidentiary\n\nrulings deprived him of a fair trial. See United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d 139,\n\n178 (2d Cir. 2008). We have exhaustively reviewed his contentions of trial error\n\nand have concluded that none of those contentions has merit. The challenged\n\ntrial rulings were well within the district court’s discretion, and the various\n\nexclusions did not prevent the defense from offering evidence probative of\n\ninnocence. At the trial in this case, the government presented overwhelming\n\nevidence that Ulbricht was indeed Dread Pirate Roberts. The evidence that the\n\ndefense was precluded from offering to refute that proof was excluded because it\n\nwas speculative, unreliable, offered in contravention of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence or of Criminal Procedure, or otherwise inadmissible. The few instances\n\n\n                                         110\n\fin which the district court’s rulings may be questioned, where we noted the\n\nrelevance of the harmless error rule, involved minor and marginal points.\n\nAccordingly, whether considered separately or cumulatively, none of Ulbricht’s\n\nevidentiary arguments lead us to doubt that he was found guilty after a fair trial.\n\nIII.   Sentencing\n\n       “[A] district court has broad latitude to impose either a Guidelines\n\nsentence or a non-Guidelines sentence.” Rigas, 583 F.3d at 114 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). “Accordingly, the role of the Court of Appeals is limited to\n\nexamining a sentence for reasonableness, which is akin to review under an\n\n‘abuse-of-discretion’ standard.” Id. “This standard applies both to the\n\n[substantive reasonableness of the] sentence itself and to the procedures\n\nemployed in arriving at the sentence.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nUlbricht and amici60 challenge his life sentence as both procedurally and\n\nsubstantively unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n60\n  The amici who join Ulbricht’s challenge to his life sentence include: the Drug\nPolicy Alliance, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, JustLeadershipUSA, and\nretired District Judge Nancy Gertner.\n\n                                        111\n\f      A. Procedural Reasonableness\n\n      “A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court fails to\n\ncalculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treats the\n\nSentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the § 3553(a) factors, selects\n\na sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the\n\nchosen sentence.” United States v. Jesurum, 819 F.3d 667, 670 (2d Cir. 2016)\n\n(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). To “hold that a factual finding\n\nis ‘clearly erroneous,’ we must be left with the definite and firm conviction that a\n\nmistake has been committed.” United States v. DeSilva, 613 F.3d 352, 356 (2d Cir.\n\n2010). Where “there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s\n\nchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.” United States v. Norman, 776\n\nF.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). In general, a\n\n“sentencing court has discretion to consider a wide range of information in\n\narriving at an appropriate sentence.” United States v. Prescott, 920 F.2d 139, 143\n\n(2d Cir. 1990). “The district court’s factual findings at sentencing need be\n\nsupported only by a preponderance of the evidence.” Norman, 776 F.3d at 76.\n\n“Where we identify procedural error in a sentence, but the record indicates\n\nclearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in any\n\n\n                                         112\n\fevent, the error may be deemed harmless, avoiding the need to vacate the\n\nsentence and to remand the case for resentencing.” United States v. Jass, 569 F.3d\n\n47, 68 (2d Cir 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States v.\n\nCavera, 550 F.3d 180, 197 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc) (declining to reach claim that\n\ndistrict court erred in relying on vague concern about gun violence because it\n\nwas clear that the “district court would have imposed the same sentence had it\n\nrelied solely on” the permissible concern about deterrence).\n\n      Ulbricht’s only claim of procedural error is that it was improper for the\n\ndistrict court to consider six drug-related deaths as relevant to his sentence\n\nbecause there was insufficient information connecting them with drugs\n\npurchased on Silk Road. In terms of our sentencing jurisprudence, Ulbricht\n\nclaims that the district court relied on clearly erroneous facts in imposing\n\nsentence. We are not persuaded.\n\n      Ulbricht submitted an expert report in which Dr. Mark Taff wrote that the\n\nrecords associated with the six deaths were substantially incomplete. For\n\nexample, many did not include full autopsies, rendering it difficult to discern the\n\nprecise cause of death to a reasonable degree of medical certainty in five of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         113\n\fcases.61 Equally importantly, Dr. Taff wrote that he could not conclusively\n\nconnect the specific drugs that the decedents consumed with Silk Road, because\n\nit is impossible to “correlate the time of purchase/acquisition from an alleged Silk\n\nRoad vendor” and the “time of usage of the alleged Silk road purchase” with the\n\ndeaths.62 S.A. 446. We assume for purposes of this opinion that Dr. Taff’s\n\nconclusions are sufficiently sound to raise a genuine question about whether the\n\ndeaths described in the PSR were caused by drugs purchased on Silk Road. As\n\nexplained above, however, Ulbricht was not being prosecuted or punished for\n\nhomicide on a theory that he personally caused those deaths. Nor did the fact of\n\nthe deaths increase his offense level under the Guidelines. The question before\n\nthe district court was whether the sale of large quantities of drugs on Silk Road\n\n\n61\n  In the sixth case, Dr. Taff concluded that the cause of death was ingesting\nmultiple drugs coupled with a pre-existing heart condition. The original forensic\nreports concerning that death did not factor in the presence of drugs other than\nsynthetic marijuana (obtained via Silk Road) and did not include the heart\ncondition as a contributing cause.\n62\n  Sentencing amici make a similar argument, claiming that a complex array of\ncauses are responsible for drug-related deaths, including societal failures.\nAssuming that is correct, the increased availability of drugs is certainly one of the\ncauses of overdose and other drug-related accidental deaths. Thus, the district\ncourt did not err in concluding that Silk Road, which was by all accounts a\nmarket-expanding drug enterprise, contributed to the general social costs of drug\ntrafficking. Those harms are numerous and include the risk of death.\n\n                                         114\n\fcreated a sufficient risk of death to permit the district court to take the deaths into\n\naccount in assessing the seriousness of Ulbricht’s crimes when it considered the\n\nfactors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n      As with other facts relevant to sentencing, that question is for the district\n\ncourt to answer, based on the preponderance of the evidence. Norman, 776 F.3d at\n\n76. Contrary to Ulbricht’s claims, the district court did not summarily reject Dr.\n\nTaff’s conclusions. Rather, it addressed his report carefully and acknowledged\n\nthe evidentiary challenges of connecting the deaths to Silk Road. The court\n\nconcluded that Dr. Taff’s proposed “reasonable degree of medical certainty”\n\nstandard was simply too high an evidentiary standard for purposes of including\n\nthe deaths in the PSR. The court reasoned that it was “not asking whether the but\n\nfor cause of death is drugs purchased on Silk Road,” but rather “whether there is\n\na connection between the purchase of drugs on Silk Road and [the] death” in the\n\nsense that the sale of those drugs created a risk of death. App’x 1476.\n\n      For those limited purposes and judged by that standard, the circumstantial\n\nevidence connecting the drug-related deaths to Silk Road was sufficient to\n\nconsider them at Ulbricht’s sentencing. To take the strongest example, one\n\ndecedent was found in his apartment with a package torn open. His computer\n\n\n                                         115\n\fhad the Silk Road site open, with chat messages from the vendor describing the\n\nheroin and prescription drug purchase as well as the package tracking\n\ninformation. The tracking number matched the information on the torn package\n\nin the apartment. A toxicology report determined that he died of an overdose of\n\nheroin combined with other prescription drugs. The facts connecting the other\n\nfive deaths to Silk Road varied in strength. The available evidence was sufficient,\n\nhowever, to allow the district court find by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nthe deaths were connected to Silk Road; therefore, the court could consider the\n\nrisk of death that the site created. Nothing in the sentencing transcript suggests\n\nthat the court considered the information for any other purpose.\n\n      We are sensitive to the possibility that the evidence of the six deaths was\n\nemotionally inflammatory and risked implicitly escalating Ulbricht’s\n\nresponsibility from facilitating the sale of drugs to causing the deaths of several\n\ndrug users.63 But there is no indication that the deaths in question played such a\n\nrole in the district court’s sentencing determination. In urging the court to\n\n\n\n63\n  Ulbricht does not argue that the evidence related to the accidental overdose\ndeaths should have been excluded due to its emotional nature; his argument is\nbased solely on the claim that the evidence was irrelevant because the deaths\nwere not sufficiently linked to Silk Road.\n\n                                         116\n\fconsider evidence of the deaths, the government explained that the deaths\n\n“illustrate the obvious: that drugs can cause serious harm, including death.”\n\nApp’x 902. See United States v. Pacheco, 489 F.3d 40, 48 n.5 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(observing that a defendant who “engaged in the commercial trade of potent\n\nsubstances . . . must have known [that such trade] could have dire\n\nconsequences”).\n\n      Of course, to the extent that the harms of the drug trade were obvious,\n\nthere was no need to introduce evidence of these particular incidents, let alone to\n\nhammer the point home with unavoidably emotional victim impact statements\n\nby parents of two of the decedents.64 No federal judge needs to be reminded of\n\nthe tragic consequences of the traffic in dangerous substances on the lives of\n\nusers and addicts, or of the risks of overdose and other ramifications of the most\n\ndangerous of illegal drugs. Those consequences are among the reasons why\n\nillegal drugs are prohibited and constitute a principal justification advanced for\n\nthe extremely lengthy sentences provided by federal statutes and sentencing\n\nguidelines for trafficking in illicit substances. Absent reason to believe that a drug\n\n\n64\n  Ulbricht does not challenge the propriety of those statements apart from his\ngeneral argument that it was procedurally unreasonable to consider the six\ndeaths as relevant to his sentence.\n\n                                          117\n\fdealer’s methods were unusually reckless, in that they enhanced the risk of death\n\nfrom drugs he sold beyond those already inherent in the trade, we do not think\n\nthat the fact that the ever-present risk of tragedy came to fruition in a particular\n\ninstance should enhance those sentences, or that the inability of the government\n\nto link a particular dealer’s product to a specific death should mitigate them. The\n\ngovernment’s insistence on proceeding with this evidence generated an appellate\n\nissue that has taken on a disproportionate focus in relation to the reasons actually\n\nadvanced by the district court in its lengthy and careful statement of the reasons\n\nfor the sentence it imposed. App’x 1509-41.\n\n      We are not persuaded, however, that the introduction of the evidence in\n\nthis case was error, although it may have been incautious for the government to\n\ninsist on presenting it to the district court. As already explained, it was certainly\n\nappropriate for the district court to consider the risk of death from use of drugs\n\nin assessing the seriousness of the offense conduct, one of the factors that a judge\n\nmust consider in imposing sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A). That appears\n\nto be the only way the judge in this case used the evidence of the drug-related\n\ndeaths. Emotionally wrenching as the statements of the decedents’ parents were,\n\nwe cannot and do not assume that federal judges are unable to put their\n\n\n                                         118\n\fsympathies for particular victims to one side and assess the evidence for its\n\nrational relationship to the sentencing decision. And here, the record makes clear\n\nthat the district court did not use the evidence of the drug-related deaths to\n\nenhance Ulbricht’s sentence, either as a formal matter under the Guidelines or\n\notherwise. For all the extensive litigation of the propriety of including this\n\ninformation in the PSR, in imposing sentence the district court did not refer to the\n\ndrug-related deaths as an aggravating factor. Indeed, the only mention of that\n\nevidence at all was a passing reference to “facts brought out in connection with\n\n[those] death[s]” that “provide evidence of first-time and expanded [drug]\n\nusage.” App’x 1521-22. This reference occurred in the entirely appropriate\n\ncontext of a lengthy discussion of the general social harms of Ulbricht’s massive\n\ndrug-trading marketplace. Id. at 1522-28.\n\n      That discussion was particularly germane to this case for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Ulbricht claimed that Silk Road reduced the harms associated with the drug\n\ntrade in several ways. For example, he argued that trafficking in drugs over the\n\nInternet reduced violence associated with hand-to-hand transactions and the\n\nsocietal stigma of drug use, and Silk Road’s vendor rating system ensured that\n\ncustomers had access to better quality drugs and more information about the\n\n\n                                         119\n\fdrugs that they were purchasing. Those arguments prompted the district court to\n\nreflect broadly on the costs of the drug trade and discuss Silk Road’s\n\nparticipation in those harms. Reasonable people may and do disagree about the\n\nsocial utility of harsh sentences for the distribution of controlled substances, or\n\neven of criminal prohibition of their sale and use at all. It is very possible that, at\n\nsome future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and\n\nadopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and\n\ncosts of drug use.\n\n      At this point in our history, however, the democratically-elected\n\nrepresentatives of the people have opted for a policy of prohibition, backed by\n\nsevere punishment. That policy results in the routine incarceration of many\n\ntraffickers for extended periods of time. This case involves a defendant who\n\nstood at one remove from the trade, who did not for the most part dirty his\n\nhands with the actual possession and sale of drugs and other contraband that his\n\nsite offered. But he did take a cut of the proceeds, in exchange for making it\n\neasier for such drugs to be purchased and sold, in a way that may well have\n\nexpanded the market by allowing more people access to drugs in greater\n\nquantities than might otherwise have been available to them. In the routine\n\n\n                                          120\n\finstances of sentencing drug sellers, the dangerous aspects of the trade are close\n\nto the surface and require little emphasis. In this case, a reminder of the\n\nconsequences of facilitating such transactions was perhaps more necessary,\n\nparticularly because Ulbricht claimed that his site actually made the drug trade\n\nsafer, and he appeared to contest the legitimacy of the laws he violated.65\n\n\n65\n  In a footnote in his reply brief, Ulbricht raises for the first time an additional\nargument: that the district court improperly gave him a life sentence because of\nthe political and philosophical beliefs that led him to start Silk Road in the first\ninstance. Ulbricht argues that reliance on political beliefs at sentencing is\nprohibited by the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10, and the First Amendment. The\ndistrict court reflected on Ulbricht’s philosophy, however, only in the course of\ndiscussing his character and his reasons for committing the offense. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(a)(1). That discussion was relevant to sentencing. Ulbricht, as the district\ncourt concluded,“viewed Silk Road both as above the law and the laws didn’t\napply.” App’x 1515. He appeared to believe that his personal views about the\npropriety of the drug laws and the paramount role of individual liberty entitled\nhim to violate democratically-enacted criminal prohibitions. For example, some\nof his Silk Road posts “discuss the laws as the oppressor” and proclaim that\n“each transaction is a victory over the oppressor.” Id. at 1516. That Ulbricht\nbelieves that drug use should be legalized is not relevant to sentencing; that he\nbelieves he is entitled to break the laws that prohibit certain substances is\nrelevant to his likelihood of recidivism, a mandated sentencing consideration. 18\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(C). The district court therefore did not sentence Ulbricht based\non any prohibited characteristic, nor did the court place more weight on that\nfactor than the facts warranted. Cf. United States v. Jenkins, —F.3d.—, 2017 WL\n1371399 (2d Cir. Apr. 17, 2017) (vacating a sentence as substantively\nunreasonable where the district court relied exclusively on the defendant’s\n“disdain for the law” in “dramatically increasing” a defendant’s sentence for\nchild pornography offenses). Ulbricht’s disrespect for the law was simply one\nfactor that the district court considered in imposing sentence, along with many\n\n                                         121\n\f      Finally, we need look no further than the district court’s express reasons\n\nfor imposing sentence to conclude that drug-related deaths played little part in\n\ndictating the sentence imposed. As tragic as they are, and as foreseeable in light\n\nof the volume of dangerous drugs trafficked through Silk Road, those deaths\n\nwere accidents. In light of the overwhelming evidence, discussed below, that\n\nUlbricht was prepared, like other drug kingpins, to protect his profits by paying\n\nlarge sums of money to have individuals who threatened his enterprise\n\nmurdered, it would be plainly wrong to conclude that he was sentenced for\n\naccidental deaths that the district court discussed only in passing in imposing\n\nsentence. Even were we to conclude that the evidence of the Silk Road-related\n\ndeaths should not have been received, any error would be harmless, because the\n\nrecord is absolutely clear that the district court, after finding that Ulbricht\n\ncommissioned five murders, would have imposed the same sentence if the\n\nevidence of the drug-related deaths had been excluded.\n\n      The sentencing amici advance one additional argument: that the district\n\ncourt’s consideration of the drug-related deaths violated the Fifth and Sixth\n\nAmendments because the fact of those deaths was not charged in the Indictment\n\n\nothers, and was not accorded undue weight in determining the sentence.\n\n                                          122\n\fand proven to the jury. “While we are not required to address arguments raised\n\nonly by an amicus,” Am. Atheists, Inc. v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & New Jersey, 760 F.3d\n\n227, 237 n.11 (2d Cir. 2014), we do so here in an excess of caution. The argument\n\nis without merit under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and its\n\nprogeny.\n\n      A district court may consider as part of its sentencing determination\n\nuncharged conduct proven by a preponderance of the evidence as long as that\n\nconduct does not increase either the statutory minimum or maximum available\n\npunishment. See United States v. Stevenson, 834 F.3d 80, 85 (2d Cir. 2016); United\n\nStates v. Ryan, 806 F.3d 691, 693-94 (2d Cir. 2015). The Supreme Court has “long\n\nrecognized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfinding,\n\ndoes not violate the Sixth Amendment.” Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151,\n\n2163 (2013). Here, the six drug-related deaths (and more importantly, Ulbricht’s\n\nattempted murders for hire) were uncharged facts that did not increase either the\n\nstatutory twenty-year minimum or the maximum life sentence applicable to the\n\ncrimes of which he was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, by the jury.\n\nThus, the district court did not violate the Constitution when it found by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the six deaths were connected to Silk Road\n\n\n                                         123\n\fand that they were relevant to Ulbricht’s sentence because they were part of the\n\nharm that the site caused.\n\n      In sum, we might not, in the prosecutors’ shoes, have chosen to offer this\n\nevidence at sentencing, or have admitted it as district judges. We conclude,\n\nhowever, (1) that the district court did not clearly err when it found by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the six deaths were connected to Silk Road;\n\n(2) that it did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was appropriate to\n\nconsider those acts as bearing on the seriousness of the narcotics offenses of\n\nwhich Ulbricht was convicted, one of many factors the district court was required\n\nto consider in exercising its discretion under § 3553(a); and (3) that the evidence\n\nin question in fact played a minimal role, if any, in the actual sentencing, and that\n\nin light of the reasons given by the district court for its sentencing decision, we\n\ncan be absolutely certain that the same sentence would have been imposed if the\n\nevidence had not been received. Ulbricht’s sentence was therefore not\n\nprocedurally unreasonable.\n\n      B. Substantive Unreasonableness\n\n      “We will . . . set aside a district court’s substantive [sentencing]\n\ndetermination only in exceptional cases where the trial court’s decision cannot be\n\n\n                                         124\n\flocated within the range of permissible decisions.” Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189\n\n(emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). Our review is “deferential,”\n\nand this Court does “not consider what weight we would ourselves have given a\n\nparticular factor.” Rigas, 583 F.3d at 122. “Rather, we consider whether the factor,\n\nas explained by the district court, can bear the weight assigned it under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances in the case.” Id. Our role in “patrolling the\n\nboundaries of reasonableness” is modest. United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265,\n\n289 (2d Cir. 2012) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAccordingly, we “will set aside only those outlier sentences that reflect actual\n\nabuse of a district court’s considerable sentencing discretion.” United States v.\n\nMessina, 806 F.3d 55, 66 (2d Cir. 2015).\n\n      In light of the deferential standard of review, we cannot say that Ulbricht’s\n\nlife sentence was substantively unreasonable. The district court identified\n\nnumerous facts that made Ulbricht’s case extraordinary, in its view rendering a\n\nlife sentence “sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the\n\npurposes” of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The court described the crime as a\n\n“planned, comprehensive, and deliberate scheme . . . which posed serious danger\n\nto public health and to our communities.” App’x 1511-12. Silk Road was a\n\n\n                                           125\n\f“worldwide criminal drug enterprise with a massive geographic scope.” Id. at\n\n1512. The fact that Ulbricht operated the site from behind a computer, rather than\n\nin person like a more prototypical drug kingpin, does not make his crime less\n\nserious or less dangerous. Moreover, Silk Road uniquely expanded the drug\n\nmarket by providing an easy avenue for people to become first-time drug users\n\nand dealers. Because drugs were shipped to customers in the mail, Silk Road\n\nbrought “drugs to communities that previously may have had no access to such\n\ndrugs . . . in such quantities.” Id. at 1522.\n\n       The quantity and nature of the drugs sold on Silk Road are staggering.\n\nAccording to the PSR, from 2011 through 2013, Silk Road customers transacted in\n\napproximately $183 million worth of illegal drugs. At the time the government\n\nshut down Silk Road on October 2, 2013, there were approximately 13,802 listings\n\nfor controlled substances on the website. Of those listings, there were 643 listings\n\nfor cocaine-based products, 305 for LSD products, and 261 for methamphetamine\n\nproducts. The drugs were sold mostly for individual, personal use, but some\n\ndrugs such as heroin and cocaine were also available in “multi-kilogram\n\nquantities.” PSR ¶ 26. The available drugs were not limited to heroin, narcotics,\n\nsynthetic marijuana, and other dangerous but recreational substances. For\n\n\n                                           126\n\fexample, after being told that cyanide was “the most well known assassination\n\nsuicide [sic] poison out there,” Ulbricht allowed vendors to sell it on Silk Road\n\ndespite its singular, deadly purpose. App’x 1519. As the district court noted,\n\ndespite earlier protestations that Silk Road would not allow the sale of products\n\nthat could be used to inflict deliberate harm on others, it took Ulbricht all of six\n\nminutes to decide “that it is okay to sell cyanide,” id., in exchange for the\n\ncustomary cut of the proceeds.\n\n      The drug offenses alone—ignoring all other illicit materials sold on the\n\nsite66—yielded a calculated offense level of 50. Of that calculation, only two levels\n\n\n66\n  As explained, Silk Road also trafficked in illegal goods such as counterfeit\nidentification documents and computer hacking tools and services. When the\ngovernment shut down Silk Road, there were 156 listings for forged identity\ndocuments on the site. The specific computer hacking tools available included\nsoftware for compromising usernames and passwords of electronic accounts,\nincluding email and Facebook; Remote Access Tools (“RATs”) that allow hackers\nto obtain remote access to a victim’s computer, including turning on and using\nthe computer’s webcam; keyloggers, which allow a user to monitor keystrokes\ninputted by a victim to discern their passwords and other sensitive information;\nand Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) tools, which allow hackers to disable\nwebsites by flooding networks with malicious Internet traffic. Silk Road also\noffered money laundering services through vendors who sold U.S. currency and\nanonymous debit cards. Because the adjusted offense levels for those groups of\noffenses were substantially lower than the offense level for the drug group, they\ndid not contribute to Ulbricht’s overall offense level. In assessing the substantive\nreasonableness of the sentence imposed, however, it is well to remember that the\nsentence encompassed Ulbricht’s role not only in the distribution of controlled\n\n                                         127\n\fare attributable to Ulbricht’s “credible threats of directed violence” associated\n\nwith the murders for hire. PSR ¶ 94. Thus, even without considering that\n\nenhancement, the drug convictions yielded an offense level of 48, which is higher\n\nthan the maximum offense level recognized by the Guidelines, for which a\n\nsentence of life imprisonment is recommended even for someone who, like\n\nUlbricht, has no prior criminal convictions. Ulbricht does not challenge the\n\naccuracy of the Guidelines calculation or of the fact-findings on which it is based.\n\n      That the sentence imposed accorded with the Guidelines recommendation\n\ndoes not automatically render it reasonable. See United States v. Dorvee, 616 F.3d\n\n174, 182 (2d Cir. 2010). The Guidelines are, however, themselves a factor that\n\nCongress has directed district courts to consider. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4)(A).\n\nMoreover, as the considered judgment of the United States Sentencing\n\nCommission, they bear on the other factors that Congress has required courts to\n\nevaluate, including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, id.\n\n§ 3553(a)(2)(A), to provide adequate deterrence, id. § 3553(a)(2)(B), and, because\n\nthey are considered by all judges throughout the federal system, the need to\n\n\n\n\nsubstances, but in a wide variety of other criminal offenses as well.\n\n\n                                         128\n\f“avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records\n\nwho have been found guilty of similar conduct,” id. § 3553(a)(6).\n\n      Accordingly, while a life sentence for selling drugs alone would give\n\npause, we would be hard put to find such a sentence beyond the bounds of\n\nreason for drug crimes of this magnitude.67 But the facts of this case involve much\n\nmore than simply facilitating the sale of narcotics. The district court found by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Ulbricht commissioned at least five murders\n\nin the course of protecting Silk Road’s anonymity, a finding that Ulbricht does\n\nnot challenge in this appeal.68 Ulbricht discussed those anticipated murders\n\ncallously and casually in his journal and in his communications with the\n\n\n67\n  Note that such a sentence is mandatory under federal law for selling just five\nkilograms of cocaine after two prior convictions for any felony narcotics offense,\nsee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), and the Supreme Court has upheld against\nconstitutional challenge a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for selling\n650 grams of cocaine, Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991).\n68\n  Ulbricht does not mention his orders for the commission of those murders until\nhis reply brief. Even there, he does not argue that the district court erred in\nconcluding that he deliberately commissioned those murders; rather, he claims\ninstead only that the murders did not support a life sentence because they did\nnot actually take place. But in evaluating Ulbricht’s character and dangerousness,\nthe most relevant points are that he wanted the murders to be committed, he\npaid for them, and he believed that they had been carried out. The fact that his\nhired assassin may have defrauded him does not reflect positively on Ulbricht’s\ncharacter. Commissioning the murders significantly justified the life sentence.\n\n                                        129\n\fpurported assassin Redandwhite. For example, in connection with the first hit, he\n\nwrote to Redandwhite that “FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn’t mind if\n\nhe was executed.” Tr. 1822. In the course of negotiating the price for the killing,\n\nDPR claimed that “[n]ot long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k,” id. at 1883, but\n\nthat he had “only ever commissioned the one other hit, so I’m still learning this\n\nmarket,” id. at 1884. He then paid $150,000 in Bitcoins for the murder, and he\n\nreceived what purported to be photographic documentation if its completion.\n\nUlbricht then wrote in his journal that he “[g]ot word that the blackmailer was\n\nexecuted,” id. at 1887, before returning quickly to other tasks associated with\n\nrunning the site.\n\n      In negotiating the other four killings, Ulbricht initially resisted multiple\n\nmurders. He instructed Redandwhite to “just hit Andrew [usernames Tony76\n\nand nipplesuckcanuck] and leave it at that.” Id. at 1897. Redandwhite said he\n\ncould do it for “150 just like last time,” but that he would not be able to recover\n\nany of DPR’s money if he killed only one person because he would have to\n\ncommit the murder outside of the victim’s home or office where he stored his\n\nfunds. Id. If Ulbricht wanted him to recover money, the self-professed assassin\n\nclaimed, he would have to kill not only Tony76, but also his three associates. DPR\n\n\n                                         130\n\fresponded that he would “defer to [Redandwhite’s] better judgment and hope[d]\n\n[to] recover some assets” from the hit. Id. at 1899. He then sent $500,000 in\n\nBitcoins, the agreed-upon price for four killings, to Redandwhite. As the district\n\ncourt stated in discussing Ulbricht’s journal entries concerning these projected\n\nmurders, his words are “the words of a man who is callous as to the\n\nconsequences or the harm and suffering that [his actions] may cause others.”\n\nApp’x 1521.\n\n      The record was more than sufficient to support the district court’s reliance\n\non those attempted murders in sentencing Ulbricht to life in prison. The\n\nattempted murders for hire separate this case from that of an ordinary drug\n\ndealer, regardless of the quantity of drugs involved in the offense, and lend\n\nfurther support to the district court’s finding that Ulbricht’s conduct and\n\ncharacter were exceptionally destructive. That he was able to distance himself\n\nfrom the actual violence he paid for by using a computer to order the killings is\n\nnot mitigating. Indeed, the cruelty that he displayed in his casual and confident\n\nnegotiations for the hits is unnerving. We thus cannot say that a life sentence was\n\noutside the “range of permissible decisions” under the circumstances. Cavera, 550\n\nF.3d at 189.\n\n\n                                        131\n\f      Ulbricht’s arguments on appeal have rhetorical power because of the sheer\n\nmagnitude of his sentence, but they do not provide a legal basis for vacating that\n\nsentence as substantively unreasonable. He contends that the district court\n\nignored the letters submitted on his behalf, thus failing to consider his positive\n\ncontributions to his family and society as well as his potential productivity\n\nshould he be released from prison. To the contrary, however, the district court\n\n“read each and every one of [the letters] with care,” some “more than once.”\n\nApp’x 1534. Recognizing that the letters were “beautiful” and “profoundly\n\nmoving,” the district court observed that they reveal Ulbricht’s human\n\ncomplexity. Id. at 1534-35. Nothing in the record supports the claim that the\n\ndistrict court failed to recognize the importance of the letters, incorrectly\n\ndiscounted Ulbricht’s more favorable characteristics, or otherwise\n\ninappropriately dismissed their role in its sentencing determination.\n\n      Similarly, Ulbricht’s argument that the district court ignored his contention\n\nthat Silk Road reduced the harmful effects of drug crimes must be rejected. The\n\ndistrict court thoroughly discussed Doctor X’s role at Silk Road and Ulbricht’s\n\nclaims that the site reduced violence, overdoses, and other harms associated with\n\ndrug trafficking, and concluded that they were unpersuasive. We see no error in\n\n\n                                         132\n\fits analysis, and Ulbricht’s arguments concerning harm reduction do not render\n\nhis sentence substantively unreasonable.\n\n      Ulbricht also claims that there is an unwarranted disparity between his\n\nsentence and the approximately 17-month sentence that Peter Nash, a Silk Road\n\nadministrator, received. Again, however, the district court considered the\n\narguments concerning Nash’s sentence and found them to be irrelevant to\n\nUlbricht’s crime because Nash was a low-level site administrator who pleaded\n\nguilty and cooperated with the government. Along those same lines, Ulbricht\n\nnotes that Silk Road drug dealers received lower sentences than he did. For\n\nexample, one such drug dealer received a ten-year sentence. The fact that\n\ndifferent people involved with the site received dramatically lower sentences\n\ndoes not mean that Ulbricht’s own sentence was substantively unreasonable on\n\nthe individual facts of his case.69 Ulbricht was the creator and head administrator\n\nof the site. That fact alone distinguishes his case from that of any individual seller\n\nor employee who used or worked for the site. Ulbricht profited from every sale\n\n\n\n69\n  In his reply, Ulbricht references other instances in which people involved with\nSilk Road (and its apparent reincarnation, Silk Road 2.0) received significantly\nlower sentences. Ulbricht does not provide sufficient detail about those\nindividuals’ conduct, however, to permit meaningful comparisons with his case.\n\n                                         133\n\fon Silk Road, and he facilitated the acts of each drug dealer and drug\n\norganization that used it. Moreover, he attempted to commission at least five\n\nmurders to protect his criminal enterprise. Those facts render his case\n\ndistinguishable from those who committed other crimes using Silk Road or\n\notherwise facilitated its operation.\n\n      Ulbricht next reiterates his argument that he was more like someone\n\nrunning a crack house than like a drug kingpin because he created the online\n\nplatform that others used to sell drugs and was not himself a drug dealer.70 That\n\nargument also understates the vast extent of Silk Road’s drug market, which had\n\nthousands of customers and trafficked in about $183 million in illegal drugs.\n\nPeople may differ about whether “respectable” people who, acting as property\n\nowners, money launderers, or other facilitators of crime for personal gain are less\n\nguilty than those who personally handle the narcotics. We cannot fault the\n\ndistrict court for rejecting the argument that Ulbricht’s contribution to the\n\nnarcotics trade was inherently less culpable than that of the dealers who paid him\n\nto use Silk Road to complete their transactions.\n\n\n\n70\n  Ulbricht did sell drugs on Silk Road for at least some brief period of time, when\nhe grew and sold hallucinogenic mushrooms to drum up interest in the site.\n\n                                         134\n\f      Both the sentencing amici and Ulbricht further contend that the district\n\ncourt placed too much weight on the notion of general deterrence in meting out\n\nthe life sentence. Specifically, Ulbricht fears that resorting to “general deterrence\n\nwithout any confining principles . . . guarantees that [the sentence] will create\n\ndisparity.” Appellant Br. 139. Amici also observe that academic studies counsel\n\nagainst placing too much emphasis on general deterrence in sentencing because\n\nsevere criminal punishments do not actually decrease either supply or demand\n\nfor illegal drugs. Further, according to amici, the threat of a long sentence does\n\nnot deter criminal conduct more effectively than the threat of a shorter sentence.\n\nIn his reply, Ulbricht identifies several lucrative dark markets that have emerged\n\nsince Silk Road’s demise in 2013. In his view, the existence of multiple copycat\n\nTor-based illegal marketplaces proves that general deterrence is illusory and that\n\nthe district court placed too much weight on that factor.\n\n      Although those arguments have some support among scholars and\n\nresearchers, the ability of a sentence to “afford adequate deterrence to criminal\n\nconduct” is a factor that district courts are required by Congress to consider in\n\narriving at the appropriate sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B); see United States v.\n\nTran, 519 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir. 2008). Congress, moreover, has not concluded that\n\n\n                                         135\n\fthe persistence of narcotics crimes is a reason to abandon the efforts to deter\n\nthem by lengthy sentences. The district court observed that “general deterrence\n\nplays a particularly important role” in Ulbricht’s case because Silk Road is\n\n“without serious precedent” and generated an unusually large amount of public\n\ninterest. App’x 1532-33. The court thus carefully analyzed the role that general\n\ndeterrence played in Ulbricht’s individual case. At the same time, it is evident\n\nfrom the sentencing transcript that general deterrence was “just one element in\n\nthe [district court’s] analysis,” id. at 1533, and the district court considered many\n\nother factors before sentencing Ulbricht to life in prison. Thus, the factor of\n\ngeneral deterrence, “as explained by the district court, can bear the weight\n\nassigned it under the totality of circumstances in this case.” Rigas, 583 F.3d at 122.\n\n      Finally, Ulbricht and amici point out that life sentences are rare in the\n\nfederal system, typically reserved for egregious violent crimes, thus rendering\n\nUlbricht’s sentence substantively unreasonable.71 Moreover, according to amici,\n\nlife sentences are normally imposed in cases where that is the district judge’s\n\nonly sentencing option. Thus, they claim that Ulbricht’s life sentence is\n\n\n71\n  Amici also claim that Ulbricht’s life sentence violates the Eighth Amendment’s\nban on cruel and unusual punishment. That argument is plainly incorrect in light\nof binding Supreme Court precedent to the contrary. See Harmelin, 501 U.S. 957.\n\n                                         136\n\fsubstantively unreasonable in the context of the federal system, where life\n\nsentences are particularly rare for those with no criminal history who are\n\nconvicted of drug crimes.72\n\n      We agree with Ulbricht that life sentences are extraordinary and\n\ninfrequent, which is as it should be. But the rarity of life sentences does not mean\n\nthat the imposition of such a sentence in this case is substantively unreasonable\n\nunder our law. Each case must be considered on its own facts and in light of all of\n\nthe circumstances of a particular offense as well as other relevant conduct, which,\n\nin this case, includes five attempted murders for hire. As we have described, the\n\ndistrict court carefully considered Ulbricht’s offense, his personal characteristics,\n\nand the context for his crimes, recognizing that only exceptional cases justify\n\nsuch a severe sentence. Although we might not have imposed the same sentence\n\n\n\n72\n  In his reply, Ulbricht raises a distinct but related argument for the first time. He\nargues that “concurrences from Supreme Court opinions and dissents from\ndenials of certiorari suggest[] that judicial factfinding violates a defendant’s\nconstitutional right to a jury trial where the factfinding renders reasonable an\notherwise substantively unreasonable sentence.” Reply Br. 60. For that\nproposition, he cites United States v. Hebert, 813 F.3d 551, 563 (5th Cir. 2015), cert.\ndenied, 137 S. Ct. 37 (2016), Jones v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 8 (2014) (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting from denial of certiorari), and United States v. White, 551 F.3d 381, 386\n(6th Cir. 2008) (Merritt, J., dissenting). His argument, however, has no support in\nexisting law.\n\n                                         137\n\fourselves in the first instance, on the facts of this case a life sentence was “within\n\nthe range of permissible decisions” that the district court could have reached.\n\nRigas, 583 F.3d at 122.\n\n      We do not reach our conclusion lightly.73 A life sentence is the second most\n\nsevere penalty that may be imposed in the federal criminal justice system. “The\n\nsize of [Ulbricht’s] sentence alone [therefore] counsels our careful, searching\n\nreview of it.” United States v. Brown, 843 F.3d 74, 85 (2d Cir. 2016) (Sack., J.,\n\nconcurring). Courts have the power to condemn a young man to die in prison,\n\nand judges must exercise that power only in a small number of cases after the\n\ndeepest thought and reflection. Of course, any “sentencing proceeding is a\n\nsolemn occasion at which the judge has the weighty duty of determining the fate\n\n\n\n73\n  The life sentence is particularly severe because, as in all federal cases, Ulbricht\nwill never be eligible for parole. Unlike state sentences in jurisdictions permitting\na sentence of, for example, “25 years to life,” there is no automatic\nreconsideration of this sentence, or of whether an offender has reformed, after\nany lengthy period of incarceration. We note that, particularly in the case of a\nyoung offender, the prisoner will all but certainly change (for better or worse)\nafter many years of incarceration. In a system without parole, however, a\nsentencing court is forced to exercise its best judgment to predict whether a\nsentence of life imprisonment or one of 25, 30, or 50 years is required to serve the\npurposes of sentencing, without the option of deferring that judgment to a point\nat which the effects of incarceration, and the passage of time, will be more\napparent.\n\n                                          138\n\fof another human being.” United States v. Alcantara, 396 F.3d 189, 199 (2d Cir.\n\n2005). We must be especially sensitive to that duty where the most severe\n\nsentences are in question. The district court gave Ulbricht’s sentence the\n\nthorough consideration that it required, reviewing the voluminous sentencing\n\nsubmissions, analyzing the factors required by law, and carefully weighing\n\nUlbricht’s mitigating arguments. The extraordinarily detailed sentencing\n\ntranscript shows that the district court appreciated its important responsibility in\n\nconsidering a sentence of such magnitude and carried out that responsibility with\n\ncare and prudence. Under the law, we cannot say that its decision was\n\nsubstantively unreasonable.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in\n\nall respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                        139\n\f",

A jury convicted\n\nUlbricht of drug trafficking and other crimes associated with his creation and\n\n                                         2\n\foperation of Silk Road, an online marketplace whose users primarily purchased\n\nand sold illegal goods and services.

Because\n\nwe identify no reversible error, we AFFIRM Ulbricht’s conviction and sentence in\n\nall respects.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n       In February 2015, a jury convicted Ross William Ulbricht on seven counts\n\narising from his creation and operation of Silk Road under the username Dread\n\nPirate Roberts (“DPR”).1 Silk Road was a massive, anonymous criminal\n\n1\n The seven crimes of conviction were: (1) distribution and aiding and abetting\ndistribution of narcotics, 21 U.S.C. § 812, § 841(a)(1), § 841(b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2; (2) using the Internet to distribute narcotics, 21 U.S.C. § 812, § 841(h) and\n§ 841(b)(1)(A); (3) conspiracy to distribute narcotics, 21 U.S.C. § 846; (4) engaging\nin a continuing criminal enterprise, 21 U.S.C. § 848(a); (5) conspiring to obtain\nunauthorized access to a computer for purposes of commercial advantage and\nprivate financial gain and in furtherance of other criminal and tortious acts, 18\nU.S.C. § 1030(a)(2) and § 1030(b); (6) conspiring to traffic in fraudulent\nidentification documents, 18 U.S.C. § 1028(f); and (7) conspiring to launder\nmoney, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).\n\n                                           3\n\fmarketplace that operated using the Tor Network, which renders Internet traffic\n\nthrough the Tor browser extremely difficult to trace.2 Silk Road users principally\n\nbought and sold drugs, false identification documents, and computer hacking\n\nsoftware. Transactions on Silk Road exclusively used Bitcoins, an anonymous but\n\ntraceable digital currency.3 The site also contained a private message system,\n\nwhich allowed users to send messages to each other (similar to communicating\n\nvia email), a public forum to discuss topics related to Silk Road, and a “wiki,”\n\nwhich is like an encyclopedia that users could access to receive advice about\n\nusing the site. Silk Road customers and vendors could also access a support\n\n\n\n2\n Tor is short for the “The Onion Router.” The Tor Network is “a special network\non the Internet designed to make it practically impossible to physically locate the\ncomputers hosting or accessing websites on the network.” App’x 53. The Tor\nNetwork can be accessed via the Tor browser using software that anyone may\nobtain for free on the Internet.\n3\n Bitcoins allow vendors and customers to maintain their anonymity in the same\nway that cash does, by transferring Bitcoins between anonymous Bitcoin\naccounts, which do not contain any identifying information about the user of\neach account. The currency is “traceable” in that the transaction history of each\nindividual Bitcoin is logged in what is called the blockchain. The blockchain\nprevents a person from spending the same Bitcoin twice, allowing Bitcoin to\noperate similarly to a traditional form of currency. Bitcoin is also a completely\ndecentralized currency, operating free of nation states or central banks; anyone\nwho downloads the Bitcoin software becomes part of the Bitcoin network. The\nblockchain is stored on that network, and the blockchain automatically “self-\nupdates” when a Bitcoin transaction takes place. Tr. 160.\n\n                                         4\n\fsection of the website to seek help from the marketplace’s administrators when\n\nan issue arose.\n\n      According to the government, between 2011 and 2013, thousands of\n\nvendors used Silk Road to sell approximately $183 million worth of illegal drugs,\n\nas well as other goods and services. Ulbricht, acting as DPR, earned millions of\n\ndollars in profits from the commissions collected by Silk Road on purchases. In\n\nOctober 2013, the government arrested Ulbricht, seized the Silk Road servers,\n\nand shut down the site.\n\nI.    Silk Road Investigation\n\n      After Ulbricht created Silk Road in 2011, the site attracted the interest of at\n\nleast two separate divisions of the Department of Justice:4 the United States\n\nAttorney’s Offices for the District of Maryland and for the Southern District of\n\nNew York. Throughout the investigations, law enforcement agents knew that the\n\nperson using Dread Pirate Roberts as his or her Silk Road username had created\n\nand managed the site, but they did not know DPR’s actual identity. In 2012 and\n\n2013, agents from both offices investigated several individuals who the\n\n\n4\n The government first learned of Silk Road and began investigating it in 2011\nafter international packages containing drugs were intercepted at Chicago’s\nO’Hare airport.\n\n                                          5\n\fgovernment suspected were operating Silk Road as DPR. Those individuals\n\nincluded Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, the New\n\nYork office identified Ulbricht as DPR, but the Maryland office had investigated\n\nand later abandoned the theory that either Athavale or Karpeles might have been\n\nDread Pirate Roberts.\n\n      Two aspects of the pre-arrest investigation into Ulbricht are particularly\n\nrelevant to this appeal: (1) the pen/trap orders that the government obtained to\n\nmonitor Internet Protocol (“IP”) address traffic to and from various devices\n\nassociated with Ulbricht; and (2) the corrupt behavior of two Baltimore agents\n\nwho worked on the Silk Road investigation.\n\n      A. The Pen/Trap Orders\n\n      In September 2013, after Ulbricht became a primary suspect in the DPR\n\ninvestigation, the government obtained five “pen/trap” orders. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3121-27 (“Pen/Trap Act”). The orders authorized law enforcement agents to\n\ncollect IP address data for Internet traffic to and from Ulbricht’s home wireless\n\nrouter and other devices that regularly connected to Ulbricht’s home router.\n\nAccording to the government’s applications for the pen register and trap and\n\ntrace device, “[e]very device on the Internet is identified by a unique number”\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fcalled an IP address. S.A. 73.5 “This number is used to route information between\n\ndevices, for example, between two computers.” Id. at 73-74. In other words, an\n\n“IP address is analogous to a telephone number” because “it indicates the online\n\nidentity of the communicating device without revealing the communication’s\n\ncontent.” Id. at 74. Ulbricht does not dispute that description of how IP addresses\n\nfunction.\n\n      The pen/trap orders thus did not permit the government to access the\n\ncontent of Ulbricht’s communications, nor did the government “seek to obtain[]\n\nthe contents of any communications.” Id. at 75. According to Ulbricht, the\n\ngovernment’s use of his home Internet routing data violated the Fourth\n\nAmendment because it helped the government match Ulbricht’s online activity\n\nwith DPR’s use of Silk Road. Ulbricht argues that he has a constitutional privacy\n\ninterest in IP address traffic to and from his home and that the government\n\nobtained the pen/trap orders without a warrant, which would have required\n\nprobable cause.\n\n      B. Corrupt Agents Force and Bridges\n\n      One of the many other tactics that the government used to expose DPR’s\n\n5\n S.A. refers to the joint sealed appendix in this case. Portions of the sealed\nappendix quoted in this opinion are to that extent unsealed.\n\n                                          7\n\fidentity was to find low-level Silk Road administrators who helped DPR\n\nmaintain the site, obtain their cooperation, take over their Silk Road usernames,\n\nand chat with DPR under those identities. The true owners of the administrator\n\naccounts would assist in the investigation by helping the government chat with\n\nDPR and access various aspects of the site. Government agents would also create\n\ntheir own new usernames and pose as drug dealers or buyers to purchase or sell\n\nnarcotics and occasionally contact DPR directly. One of the government’s\n\nprincipal trial witnesses, Special Agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, used the former\n\ntechnique to chat with DPR under the name Cirrus. Cirrus had been a member of\n\nthe Silk Road support staff before the government took over his account, and\n\nDer-Yeghiayan frequently used Silk Road’s messaging system to communicate\n\nwith DPR and other administrators as Cirrus. Cirrus also gave the government\n\naccess to the staff chat, a separate program allowing DPR to communicate only\n\nwith his employees.\n\n      Two undercover agents involved in the Silk Road investigation are of\n\nparticular import to this appeal: Secret Service Special Agent Shaun Bridges and\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) Special Agent Carl Force, both of\n\nwhom were assigned to the Baltimore investigation. Both Force and Bridges used\n\n\n                                         8\n\ftheir undercover access to exploit the site for their own benefit in various ways,\n\nand they eventually pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with their\n\nwork on the Silk Road investigation.6\n\n      For example, Force and Bridges took over an administrator account\n\nbelonging to Curtis Green, who worked for Silk Road under the name Flush.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint against Force and Bridges, in January 2013,\n\nBridges used the Flush username to change other users’ passwords, empty their\n\nBitcoin wallets,7 and keep $350,000 in Bitcoins in offshore bank accounts, all while\n\nattempting to hide his activity through a series of transactions.8 Specifically, the\n\n\n6\n  Both Force and Bridges pleaded guilty to money laundering and obstruction of\njustice; Force also pleaded guilty to extortion. Force was sentenced to 78 months\nin prison, and Bridges received a 71-month sentence.\n7\n  According to the criminal complaint against Ulbricht, a Bitcoin wallet is a\nstorage method for Bitcoins. The wallet is associated with a Bitcoin address,\nwhich is “analogous to the account number for a bank account, while the ‘wallet’\nis analogous to a bank safe where the money in the account is physically stored.”\nApp’x 59. Users can transact in Bitcoin by transferring Bitcoins from one “Bitcoin\naddress to the Bitcoin address of another user, over the Internet.” Id. Ulbricht\ndoes not dispute that definition.\n8\n As described below, the government disclosed shortly before trial that Force\nwas under investigation for Silk Road corruption, but said nothing about Bridges.\nSpecifically, the pretrial disclosure noted that Force was under investigation for\nusing the Flush account to steal $350,000, but the criminal complaint against the\nagents alleges that Bridges committed that particular theft. According to the\ngovernment, both Force and Bridges had access to the Flush account, which\n\n                                          9\n\fcomplaint against Force and Bridges alleges that Bridges “act[ed] as an\n\nadministrator to reset pins and passwords on various Silk Road vendors’\n\naccounts,” then exchanged the Bitcoins for U.S. dollars using the Mt. Gox\n\nexchanger.9 Supp. App’x 180. Shortly after he committed the January 2013 thefts,\n\nBridges asked Force to chat with DPR as Nob, Force’s authorized undercover\n\nusername, to get advice about how to liquidate Bitcoins. He also sought Force’s\n\nhelp in convincing Curtis Green (formerly Flush) to help him transfer Bitcoins to\n\nother accounts, and he ultimately tried to blame Green for the theft.\n\n        With the government’s approval, Force also posed as a drug dealer and\n\ncommunicated with DPR as Nob. As part of his official undercover work as Nob,\n\nForce agreed to sell fraudulent identification documents to DPR for $40,000 in\n\nBitcoins. According to the criminal complaint against the agents, Force kept the\n\nBitcoins received by his Nob account in connection with that transaction for his\n\npersonal use. On another occasion, again as part of his authorized undercover\n\nwork, Force advised DPR that he had access to information about Silk Road from\n\nan invented corrupt government employee. DPR paid Force $50,000 in Bitcoins\n\n\n\nmight explain their initial suspicion that Force stole the funds.\n9\n    Mt. Gox was a prominent Bitcoin exchanger owned by Mark Karpeles.\n\n                                         10\n\ffor purported inside law enforcement information; Force allegedly purloined that\n\npayment as well. Moreover, outside his authorized undercover work, Force\n\noperated another account under the name French Maid, through which he again\n\noffered to sell DPR information about the government’s Silk Road investigation.\n\nActing as French Maid, Force received about $100,000 in Bitcoins that he kept for\n\nhis personal use.\n\n      Force created yet another unauthorized Silk Road account, under the name\n\nDeathFromAbove, which was unknown to law enforcement until the defense\n\nidentified it during trial. Force used the DeathFromAbove account to try to extort\n\nmoney from DPR. For example, in one such chat that took place on April 16,\n\n2013, DeathFromAbove told DPR that he knew that DPR’s true identity was\n\nAnand Athavale. DeathFromAbove demanded a payment of $250,000 in\n\nexchange for which DeathFromAbove would remain silent about DPR’s\n\nidentity.10 There is no evidence that DPR made the requested payment to\n\nDeathFromAbove; indeed, DPR shrugged off the attempted blackmail as\n\n\n10\n  DeathFromAbove also referred to the $250,000 payment he demanded as\n“punitive damages.” App’x 875. In the government’s view, the “punitive\ndamages” remark referenced the murder of a Silk Road administrator that\nUlbricht ordered and paid for (but that was never carried out). That and other\nkillings that DPR commissioned will be described in more detail below.\n\n                                        11\n\f“bogus.”App’x 710.\n\n      As will be explained in more detail below, the district court prevented\n\nUlbricht from introducing evidence at trial related to Force’s corruption because\n\ndoing so would have exposed the ongoing grand jury investigation into Force’s\n\nconduct. The district court also denied Ulbricht discovery related to the\n\ninvestigation and excluded certain hearsay statements that arguably revealed\n\nForce’s corruption. Ulbricht contends on appeal that the district court’s various\n\nrulings concerning evidence related to Force deprived him of a fair trial.\n\nAdditionally, Ulbricht did not learn of Bridges’s corrupt conduct until after trial\n\nwhen the criminal complaint against both agents was unsealed. Thus, in his\n\nmotion for a new trial, he argued that the belated disclosure violated his due\n\nprocess rights under Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963). Ulbricht contends on\n\nappeal that the district court incorrectly denied that motion.\n\nII.   Ulbricht’s Arrest\n\n      Ulbricht was arrested in a San Francisco public library on October 1, 2013,\n\nafter the government had amassed significant evidence identifying him as Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. The arrest was successfully orchestrated to catch Ulbricht in the\n\nact of administering Silk Road as DPR. Federal agents observed Ulbricht enter\n\n\n                                         12\n\fthe public library, and a few minutes later Dread Pirate Roberts came online in\n\nthe Silk Road staff chat. Der-Yeghiayan, under the undercover administrator\n\nusername Cirrus, initiated a chat with DPR, asking him to go to a specific place\n\non the Silk Road site to address some flagged messages from users. Der-\n\nYeghiayan reasoned that this would “force [Ulbricht] to log in under . . . his\n\nDread Pirate Roberts account” in the Silk Road marketplace, as well as in the staff\n\nchat software. Tr. 331-32.\n\n      Once Der-Yeghiayan knew that DPR had logged onto the flagged message\n\npage in the marketplace, he signaled another agent to effect the arrest. Ulbricht\n\nwas arrested, and incident to that arrest agents seized his laptop. The same chat\n\nthat Der-Yeghiayan had initiated with Dread Pirate Roberts a few minutes earlier\n\nwas open on Ulbricht’s screen. Ulbricht also visited the flagged post in the\n\nmarketplace that Der-Yeghiayan (as Cirrus) had asked DPR to look at during\n\ntheir chat. While he was chatting with Cirrus, moreover, Ulbricht had accessed\n\nSilk Road by using the “Mastermind” page. That page was available only to\n\nDread Pirate Roberts.\n\n      A great deal of the evidence against Ulbricht came from the government’s\n\nsearch of his laptop and his home after the arrest. On the day of Ulbricht’s arrest,\n\n\n                                         13\n\fthe government obtained a warrant to seize Ulbricht’s laptop and search it for a\n\nwide variety of information related to Silk Road and information that would\n\nidentify Ulbricht as Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht moved to suppress the large\n\nquantity of evidence obtained from his laptop, challenging the constitutionality\n\nof that search warrant. Ulbricht argues on appeal that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress. More details concerning the search warrant will\n\nbe described in context below.\n\nIII.   The Trial\n\n       Ulbricht’s trial lasted approximately three weeks, from January 13 through\n\nFebruary 4, 2015. Judge Forrest handled the complex and contentious trial with\n\ncommendable patience and skill. Although Ulbricht does not challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s verdict on any of the counts of\n\nconviction, we summarize the evidence presented at trial as context for the issues\n\nraised on appeal.\n\n       A. The Government’s Case\n\n       The government presented overwhelming evidence that Ulbricht created\n\nSilk Road in 2011 and continued to operate the site throughout its lifetime by\n\nmaintaining its computer infrastructure, interacting with vendors, crafting\n\n\n                                         14\n\fpolicies for site users, deciding what products would be available for sale on the\n\nsite, and managing a small staff of administrators and software engineers.\n\nDefense counsel conceded in his opening statement that Ulbricht did in fact\n\ncreate Silk Road.\n\n      According to Ulbricht’s own words in a 2009 email, Ulbricht originally\n\nconceived of Silk Road as “an online storefront that couldn’t be traced back to\n\n[him] . . . where [his] customers could buy [his] products” and pay for them\n\n“anonymously and securely.” Tr. 991. From 2009 through 2011, Ulbricht worked\n\nto get the site up and running, relying on computer programming assistance\n\nfrom others, including his friend Richard Bates. According to one of the journal\n\nentries discovered on his laptop, in 2010 Ulbricht began to grow hallucinogenic\n\nmushrooms to sell on the site “for cheap to get people interested.” Tr. 899. As the\n\nsite began to garner significant interest in 2011, Ulbricht wrote in his journal that\n\nhe was “creating a year of prosperity and power beyond what I have ever\n\nexperienced before. Silk Road is going to become a phenomenon and at least one\n\nperson will tell me about it, unknowing that I was its creator.” Tr. 899-900.\n\n             1. Evidence Linking Ulbricht to Dread Pirate Roberts\n\n      Around January 2012, the Silk Road user who represented himself as the\n\n\n                                          15\n\flead administrator of the site adopted the username Dread Pirate Roberts.11 The\n\nname alludes to the pseudonym of a pirate in the popular novel and film The\n\nPrincess Bride that is periodically passed on from one individual to another.12 In\n\norder to assure users that posts purporting to be authored by DPR were indeed\n\nhis own, DPR authenticated his posts using an electronic signature known as a\n\nPGP key.13 Silk Road users had access to a public PGP key, and DPR had a\n\nprivate PGP key that he alone could use to sign his Silk Road posts. When DPR\n\nsigned a post using his private key, Silk Road users could run the code in the\n\npublic key, and if the post was signed with the correct private key the user would\n\nreceive a message that the authentication was successful. The government\n\nrecovered DPR’s private PGP key on Ulbricht’s laptop. Importantly, the public\n\nPGP key did not change during the site’s life span, meaning that DPR used the\n\nsame private key to sign his posts throughout the time that he administered Silk\n\nRoad.\n\n11\n  The timing of this change corresponds to a January 15, 2012 Tor chat between a\nuser named “vj” and Ulbricht, in which vj advised Ulbricht to change his\nusername from Admin to Dread Pirate Roberts.\n12\n  See William Goldman, The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern’s Classic Tale of True\nLove and High Adventure (1973); The Princess Bride (20th Century Fox 1987).\n13\n     PGP stands for “Pretty Good Privacy.”\n\n                                         16\n\f      Additional evidence supported the conclusion that Ulbricht was Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. For example, the instructions that DPR provided to Cirrus (the\n\naccount that Der-Yeghiayan later used for undercover work) for how to access\n\nthe staff chat and contact DPR directly were found in a file on Ulbricht’s laptop.\n\nThe government also discovered the following evidence, covering the entire\n\nperiod during which DPR managed the Silk Road site, on Ulbricht’s computer:\n\nthousands of pages of chat logs with Silk Road employees; detailed journal\n\nentries describing Ulbricht’s ownership of the site; a list that tracked Ulbricht’s\n\ntasks and ideas related to Silk Road; a copy of Silk Road’s database; and\n\nspreadsheets cataloguing both the servers that hosted Silk Road and expenses\n\nand profits associated with the site. The government seized approximately $18\n\nmillion worth of Bitcoins from the wallet on Ulbricht’s laptop and analyzed their\n\ntransaction history (through blockchain records) to determine that about 89% of\n\nthe Bitcoins on Ulbricht’s computer came from Silk Road servers located in\n\nIceland.\n\n      A search of Ulbricht’s home yielded additional evidence linking him with\n\nthe site. That evidence included two USB hard drives with versions of documents\n\nrelated to Silk Road that were also stored on Ulbricht’s laptop. There were also\n\n\n                                          17\n\fhandwritten notes crumpled in Ulbricht’s bedroom trash can about ideas for\n\nimproving Silk Road’s vendor rating system—an initiative that Dread Pirate\n\nRoberts had just revealed through a post in a discussion forum on the site.\n\n      The government also introduced other circumstantial evidence connecting\n\nUlbricht to DPR’s activity on Silk Road, such as evidence matching Ulbricht’s\n\nactual travel history with DPR’s online discussion of his travel plans. As one\n\nconcrete example, the government discovered a Tor Chat log14 on Ulbricht’s\n\nlaptop memorializing DPR’s chat with a user named H7. On October 30, 2011,\n\nDPR told H7 that he would be traveling soon. On Ulbricht’s Gmail account,\n\nwhich uses an email address that incorporates his full name, the government\n\ndiscovered a travel itinerary from CheapAir that indicated that Ulbricht would\n\nbe traveling on November 15, 2011.\n\n      The government introduced several additional examples of DPR\n\ndiscussing travel plans that matched up with travel disclosed in Ulbricht’s email\n\nand social media activity. At one point, for example, Ulbricht uploaded photos to\n\nhis Facebook account in an album entitled “Thailand, February 2012.” DPR\n\n\n\n14\n  Tor Chat is a program that allows “communication between people on the Tor\nnetwork.” Tr. 889.\n\n                                        18\n\fdiscussed going to Thailand in a Tor chat on January 27, 2012, indicating that he\n\nwas in “Thailand now,” attracted by the “allure of a warm beach.” Tr. 1300. He\n\nalso mentioned in a January 26 chat with a user named “vj,” which stood for\n\nVariety Jones, that he was in Thailand to experience the “beaches and jungles.”\n\nId. at 1298. One of the photos in the Thailand Facebook album depicted Ulbricht\n\n“in front of what appears to be jungles and beaches,” both of which were\n\nreferenced in DPR’s chats from late January. Id. at 1301.\n\n             2. Murders Commissioned by Dread Pirate Roberts\n\n      The government also presented evidence that DPR commissioned the\n\nmurders of five people to protect Silk Road’s anonymity, although there is no\n\nevidence that any of the murders actually occurred.15 In March 2013, a Silk Road\n\n\n15\n  Ulbricht was not charged in this case with crimes based on ordering these\nkillings, although evidence relating to the murders was introduced at trial as\nactions taken in furtherance of the charged conspiracies and criminal enterprise.\nThe killings were referenced again in connection with Ulbricht’s sentencing. He\nfaces open attempted murder-for-hire charges in the District of Maryland,\nhowever. United States v. Ulbricht, No. 13-0222-CCB (D. Md.). That indictment\ncharges Ulbricht with the attempted murder of Curtis Green (Flush). According\nto the criminal complaint against the corrupt officers, after Bridges, using Flush’s\naccount, stole $350,000 in Bitcoin in January 2013, DPR recruited Nob (Force) to\nkill Flush as punishment for the theft. DPR paid Nob $80,000 to carry out the\nmurder, which Force faked to make Ulbricht believe that the task was complete.\nPresumably because the government removed from its trial evidence anything\nthat the corrupted agent Force may have touched, it did not present evidence of\n\n                                         19\n\fvendor whose username was FriendlyChemist threatened to release “thousands\n\nof usernames, ordr [sic] amounts, [and] addresses” of Silk Road customers and\n\nvendors if DPR did not ensure that FriendlyChemist received money from\n\nanother person, Lucydrop. Tr. 1806. Releasing the information would have\n\ndestroyed the affected users’ anonymity, undermining the security of the site. In\n\na later chat with another person, RealLucyDrop, DPR wrote that it would be\n\n“terrible” if the personal information were to be released, and thus he needed\n\nFriendlyChemist’s “real world identity so I can threaten him with violence if he\n\nwere to release any names.” Id. at 1811.\n\n      The episode escalated from there. DPR connected with Redandwhite, who\n\nwas FriendlyChemist’s supplier, and wrote that “FriendlyChemist is a liability\n\nand I wouldn’t mind if he was executed.” Id. at 1822. After negotiating the\n\nlogistical details of the murder, Ulbricht agreed to pay Redandwhite $150,000 in\n\nBitcoins to kill FriendlyChemist. DPR paid Redandwhite, who later confirmed\n\nthat he had received the payment and carried out the murder, and sent what\n\nappeared to be a photo of the dead victim to DPR. DPR replied that he had\n\n\n\n\nthe Flush murder-for-hire agreement, nor did it rely on that murder at\nsentencing.\n\n                                           20\n\f“received the picture and deleted it,” and thanked Redandwhite for his “swift\n\naction.” Id. at 1892. Around the same time, Ulbricht recorded in a file on his\n\nlaptop that he “[g]ot word that the blackmailer was executed.” Id. at 1887. The\n\ngovernment was not able to develop any evidence linking these conversations to\n\nan actual murder. A reasonable jury could easily conclude, however, that the\n\nevidence demonstrated that Ulbricht ordered and paid for the killing, and that he\n\nbelieved that it had occurred.\n\n      Later, DPR ordered four other murders through Redandwhite. Dread\n\nPirate Roberts identified another Silk Road user, Tony76, who knew\n\nFriendlyChemist and might compromise the site’s anonymity. After some\n\nnegotiations, DPR agreed to pay Redandwhite $500,000 in Bitcoins to kill Tony76\n\nand three of his associates. DPR then sent the payment to Redandwhite. On April\n\n6, 2013, Ulbricht wrote in a file on his laptop that he “[g]ave angels go ahead to\n\nfind tony76.” Tr. 1900. Two days later, Ulbricht recorded that he “[s]ent payment\n\nto angels for hit on tony76 and his three associates.” Id. One of the government’s\n\nexpert witnesses was able to link the payments for all five murders to Bitcoin\n\nwallets located on Ulbricht’s laptop. Again, while the evidence demonstrates that\n\nUlbricht ordered and paid substantial sums for the murders, there is no evidence\n\n\n                                         21\n\fthat the killings actually took place; the government theorized that Redandwhite\n\nhad tricked Ulbricht into thinking that he actually committed the murders, but\n\nthat in fact he had not.\n\n      B. The Defense Case\n\n      As noted above, Ulbricht conceded at trial that he had created Silk Road,\n\nand he was caught red-handed operating the site at the end of the investigation.\n\nHis principal defense strategy at trial—more of an effort at mitigation than\n\noutright denial of his guilt of the conspiracy and other charges in the\n\nindictment—was to admit his role at the beginning and end of the site’s\n\noperation, but to contend that he sold Silk Road to someone else in 2011 and\n\nabandoned his role as its administrator, only to be lured back by the successor\n\nDPR near the end of its operation to take the blame for operating the site. The\n\ndefense attempted on several occasions to implicate as alternative suspects\n\nKarpeles and Athavale, both of whom the government had investigated for a\n\npossible connection to Silk Road but later abandoned as candidates for DPR’s\n\nreal-world identity. As part of his alternative-perpetrator defense, Ulbricht\n\ntheorized that the person or persons who operated as the true Dread Pirate\n\nRoberts during the purported interim period planted incriminating evidence on\n\n\n                                         22\n\fhis laptop in order to frame him. For the most part, the defense advanced this\n\ntheory through cross-examination of government witnesses. Ulbricht did not\n\ntestify at trial.\n\n       One point in the testimony of Richard Bates exemplifies the defense’s\n\napproach and the government’s response. Bates, Ulbricht’s friend who assisted\n\nwith computer programming issues when Ulbricht launched Silk Road, testified\n\nfor the government. According to Bates, Ulbricht told him in November 2011 that\n\nhe had sold Silk Road to someone else, a claim that Bates believed at the time to\n\nbe true. Moreover, in a February 2013 Google chat between Bates and Ulbricht,\n\nUlbricht wrote that he was “[g]lad” that Silk Road was “not [his] problem\n\nanymore.” Tr. 1140-41.16 Bates understood that to mean that Ulbricht no longer\n\nworked on the site.\n\n       To mitigate any damage from Bates’s testimony, the government\n\nintroduced a December 9, 2011 Tor chat between Ulbricht and vj. In that chat, vj\n\nasked Ulbricht whether anyone else knew about his involvement in Silk Road.\n\n\n\n16\n  There are two versions of the trial transcript for January 22, 2015 on the district\ncourt docket. The page citations here refer to the version of the transcript marked\n“corrected,” which is listed on the district court docket as Document No. 208 (14-\ncr-68).\n\n                                         23\n\fUlbricht responded: “[U]nfortunately yes. There are two, but they think I sold the\n\nsite and got out and they are quite convinced of it.” Tr. 1191. He further wrote\n\nthat those two people thought he sold the site “about a month ago,” id., which\n\nroughly corresponds to the November 2011 conversation between Bates and\n\nUlbricht. Significantly, it was shortly after this conversation that vj suggested that\n\nUlbricht change his online identity to DPR. In view of the fictional character it\n\nreferenced, the government contended that the online moniker DPR was\n\ndeliberately adopted to support the cover story that the lead administrator of Silk\n\nRoad changed over time.\n\n      Thus, although the government elicited testimony that Ulbricht told Bates\n\nthat he sold the site in 2011, it also presented evidence that Ulbricht had lied to\n\nBates about that sale and continued to operate the site in secret.\n\n             1. Cross-Examination of Government Witnesses\n\n      Ulbricht’s defense depended heavily on cross-examination of government\n\nwitnesses, much of which was designed to support the argument that either\n\nKarpeles or Athavale was the real DPR, or that multiple people operated as\n\nDread Pirate Roberts during Silk Road’s life span. The district court limited his\n\ncross-examination in two ways that Ulbricht challenges on appeal. First, the\n\n\n                                          24\n\fdistrict court prevented Ulbricht from exploring several specific topics with Der-\n\nYeghiayan, the government’s first witness, through whom it introduced much of\n\nits evidence. Those topics included, inter alia, Der-Yeghiayan’s prior suspicions\n\nthat Karpeles was DPR. Second, the district court limited Ulbricht’s ability to\n\ncross examine FBI computer scientist Thomas Kiernan, who testified about\n\nevidence that he discovered on Ulbricht’s laptop, concerning several specific\n\ntechnical issues related to software on Ulbricht’s computer. More details about\n\nthose attempted cross-examinations will be discussed in context below.\n\n            2. Hearsay Statements\n\n      Ulbricht also attempted to introduce two hearsay statements in his defense,\n\nboth of which the district court excluded as inadmissible. Those hearsay\n\nstatements comprise: (1) chats between DPR and DeathFromAbove (Force)\n\nconcerning Force’s attempt to extort money from DPR in exchange for\n\ninformation about the government’s investigation of Silk Road; and (2) the\n\ngovernment’s letter describing a statement by Andrew Jones, a site administrator,\n\nconcerning one particular conversation that he had with DPR. The contents of\n\nthose hearsay statements and other relevant facts will be discussed in more detail\n\nbelow.\n\n\n                                         25\n\f             3. Defense Expert Witnesses\n\n      Long after the trial began on January 13, 2015, and shortly before the\n\ngovernment rested on February 2 and the defense rested on February 3, Ulbricht\n\ndisclosed to the government his intent to call two expert witnesses: Dr. Steven\n\nBellovin and Andreas Antonopoulos.17 The Antonopoulos disclosure indicated\n\nthat he would testify on several subjects relevant to Silk Road, including “the\n\norigins of Bitcoin,” “the various purposes and uses of Bitcoin,” “the mechanics of\n\nBitcoin transactions,” “the value of Bitcoin over time since its inception,” and\n\n“the concepts of Bitcoin speculating and Bitcoin mining,” among other things.\n\nApp’x 349. The Bellovin disclosure followed a similar pattern, indicating that he\n\nwould testify about “[g]eneral principles of internet security and vulnerabilities,”\n\nthe “import of some lines of PHP code provided to defense counsel in\n\ndiscovery,” and “[g]eneral principles of public-key cryptography,” among other\n\ntopics. Id. at 360. Neither disclosure summarized the opinions that the experts\n\nwould offer on those subjects, nor did either identify the bases for the experts’\n\nopinions.\n\n\n\n17\n  Ulbricht noticed his intent to call Antonopoulos on January 26 and Bellovin on\nJanuary 30, 2015.\n\n                                         26\n\f      On January 29 and 31, the government moved to preclude the testimony of\n\nboth proffered experts. The government argued that the expert notices were\n\nuntimely and did not contain the information required by Rule 16 of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure, including a summary of the opinions that the\n\nexperts would offer on the stand.18 On February 1—three days before the end of\n\nthe trial—the district court granted the government’s motions and precluded\n\nboth experts from testifying, concluding that the defendant’s notices were late\n\nand that the disclosures were substantively inadequate under Rule 16. Ulbricht\n\nclaims that the district court erred in precluding his experts from testifying.\n\n      In sum, the defense case was limited to cross-examining government\n\nwitnesses, briefly calling four character witnesses, having a defense investigator\n\nauthenticate a task list on Ulbricht’s computer, and reading a few of DPR’s posts\n\ninto the record. Ulbricht contends, however, that his defense was hamstrung by\n\nthe rulings described above.\n\n\n\n\n18\n  The government also argued generally that some of the topics identified in the\ndisclosures were not relevant to Ulbricht’s case or did not require expert\ntestimony.\n\n                                         27\n\f      C. The Verdict and Post-Trial Motion\n\n      After deliberating for about three and a half hours, the jury returned a\n\nguilty verdict on all seven counts in the Indictment. As described in more detail\n\nbelow, Ulbricht then moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, and Ulbricht argues here that it erred in doing\n\nso.\n\nIV.   Sentencing\n\n      The United States Probation Office prepared the Pre-Sentence Investigation\n\nReport (“PSR”) in March 2015. It described the offense conduct in detail and\n\ndiscussed the five murders that Ulbricht allegedly hired Redandwhite to\n\ncommit.19 Over Ulbricht’s objection, the PSR also discussed six drug-related\n\ndeaths that the government contended, and the district court found, were\n\nconnected with Silk Road. Circumstantial evidence linked each of those fatalities\n\nwith varying degrees of certainty to the decedent’s purchase of drugs on Silk\n\nRoad. For example, one user died from an overdose of heroin combined with\n\nother drugs. The deceased individual was found with a needle and a bag of\n\n\n\n19\n  The PSR did not refer to the additional murder of “Flush” that DPR allegedly\npaid Force, under his undercover identity Nob, to commit. See supra note 15.\n\n                                        28\n\fheroin, as well as a torn-open delivery package. Open on his computer was a Silk\n\nRoad chat in which a vendor described the package of heroin that was due to\n\narrive that day, including a tracking number that matched the opened package.\n\n      Two other individuals whose deaths the PSR described were Silk Road\n\ncustomers who purchased drugs on the site shortly before their deaths. A fourth\n\nperson died after ingesting a synthetic drug originally purchased on Silk Road\n\nthat he obtained through an intermediary dealer, and a fifth died after leaping\n\nfrom a balcony while high on a psychedelic drug that he bought from the site. A\n\nsixth person died of pneumonia after placing over thirty orders for heroin and\n\nother drugs on Silk Road; the autopsy report theorized that his drug use may\n\nhave “blunted the deceased’s perception of the severity of his illness,” thus\n\ncontributing to his premature death. PSR ¶ 83. In arguing that the district court\n\nshould consider the six deaths, the government explained that they “illustrate the\n\nobvious: that drugs can cause serious harm, including death.” App’x 902.\n\n      In the first of several sentencing submissions, Ulbricht urged the district\n\ncourt not to consider the six drug-related deaths and to strike them from the PSR.\n\nIn support of that argument, Ulbricht claimed that Silk Road had harm-reducing\n\neffects, meaning that it made drug use less dangerous. Specifically, Ulbricht\n\n\n                                        29\n\femployed Dr. Fernando Caudevilla (username Doctor X), a physician who\n\nprovided drug-use advice to the site’s customers. Caudevilla spent up to two or\n\nthree hours a day on Silk Road discussion fora and sent over 450 messages\n\nproviding guidance about illegal drug dosage and administration, as well as\n\ninformation about the harms associated with certain drugs. Caudevilla also\n\nprovided weekly reports to DPR concerning the advice he gave to the site’s users.\n\nUlbricht further claimed that Silk Road allowed for better drug quality control\n\nbecause vendors were subject to a rating system,20 buyers were able to choose\n\nfrom among many different sellers, and the site’s anonymity encouraged free\n\ndialogue about drug use that helped mitigate the stigma accompanying drug\n\naddiction.21 According to Caudevilla, when the site received negative feedback\n\nabout the quality of the drugs sold by a vendor, that vendor was removed from\n\n\n20\n  As the government pointed out in its sentencing submission, fake vendor\nreviews were commonplace, and vendors sometimes coerced customers into\ngiving them perfect ratings.\n21\n  Ulbricht referenced a study by Tim Bingham, who researched Silk Road users\nbetween September 2012 and August 2013. Bingham interviewed Silk Road\ncustomers and concluded that the site operated as a “novel technological drug\nsubculture, potentially minimiz[ing] drug-related stigma by reinforcing a[] sense\nof community.” App’x 905. Thus, Bingham concluded, and Ulbricht argued, that\nSilk Road encouraged more “responsible forms of recreational drug use.” Id. at\n906.\n\n                                        30\n\fthe site. Finally, Ulbricht claimed that the site reduced violence associated with\n\nthe drug trade by providing a safe, computer-based method of purchasing drugs.\n\n      Ulbricht also submitted an expert report from Dr. Mark Taff, which\n\nprovided an alternative reason for excluding the six deaths from the PSR. In his\n\nreport, Dr. Taff explained that, based on the information available, it was\n\nimpossible to know with medical certainty that Silk Road drugs caused the six\n\ndeaths described in the PSR. There were “gaping holes” in the investigations into\n\neach death, and some were missing autopsy reports, toxicology reports, and\n\ndeath certificates. App’x 911. Moreover, Dr. Taff claimed that it was impossible to\n\nknow the cause of each death because several of the deceased had ingested\n\nmultiple drugs prior to their deaths. Ulbricht argued that, absent a clear causal\n\nlink between the deaths and the offense conduct, the deaths were not relevant to\n\nhis sentencing at all.\n\n      The defense later submitted another sentencing memorandum, which\n\nincluded 97 letters from friends and family describing Ulbricht’s good character\n\nas well as academic articles about the myriad problems associated with unduly\n\nsevere sentences for drug crimes. He also urged the district court not to consider\n\nthe five murders commissioned by DPR, in part because he claimed only to have\n\n\n                                         31\n\ffantasized about the murders, implying that he did not expect them to be carried\n\nout. In its sentencing submission, the government requested that the district\n\ncourt impose a sentence substantially above the twenty-year mandatory\n\nminimum.\n\n      Ulbricht’s sentencing hearing took place on May 29, 2015.22 The district\n\ncourt concluded that Ulbricht’s offense level was 43—the highest possible offense\n\nlevel under the Sentencing Guidelines—and that his criminal history category\n\nwas I.23 The high offense level largely resulted from the massive quantity of\n\ndrugs trafficked using Silk Road, as well as several enhancements, including one\n\nfor directing the use of violence, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(2).24 Ulbricht does not\n\ndispute that calculation. Due to the high offense level, the Guidelines advisory\n\n\n22\n  At sentencing, the district court vacated Ulbricht’s convictions on Counts One\nand Three because they were lesser included offenses of Counts Two and Four\nrespectively. Ulbricht was therefore sentenced on Counts Two, Four, Five, Six,\nand Seven. The district court based its Guidelines calculation only on those\ncounts.\n23\n  The calculated offense level was actually 50, which is higher than the maximum\noffense level of 43 on the Guidelines sentencing table. The Guidelines provide\nthat “[a]n offense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.”\nU.S.S.G. ch. 5 pt. A, cmt. n.2.\n24\n  Because of the grouping rules, U.S.S.G. ch. 3 pt. D, the lower offense levels of\nthe computer hacking and fraudulent identification charges did not contribute to\nUlbricht’s offense level.\n\n                                         32\n\fsentence “range” was life in prison, and the U.S. Probation Office recommended\n\nthat sentence.\n\n      At the sentencing hearing, the district court resolved several disputed\n\nissues of fact. For example, because Ulbricht contested his responsibility for the\n\nfive commissioned murders for hire, the district court found by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that Ulbricht did in fact commission the murders, believing that\n\nthey would be carried out. The district court characterized the evidence of the\n\nmurders for hire, which included Ulbricht’s journal, chats with other Silk Road\n\nusers, and the evidence showing that Ulbricht actually paid a total of $650,000 in\n\nBitcoins for the killings, as “ample and unambiguous.” App’x 1465.\n\n      The court then turned to the six drug-related deaths described in the PSR.\n\nOver Ulbricht’s objection, the district court found that the deaths were “related\n\nconduct relevant to his sentencing” because the “question as to whether this\n\ninformation is properly included in the PSR is whether the Court finds, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence[,] that the deaths, in some way, related to Silk\n\nRoad.” Id. at 1472. It went on to explain that “the relevant offense committed is\n\nthe unlawful distribution of drugs and the running of a criminal drug enterprise,\n\n. . . [and] based on the evidence before the Court, the sale of the drugs through\n\n\n                                         33\n\fSilk Road caused harm to the decedents.” Id. at 1473. The district court described\n\nthe facts associated with five of the deaths and specifically found that each was\n\nconnected to Silk Road, rejecting the defendant’s argument that but-for causation\n\nwas required in order for the court to consider the deaths as relevant to the\n\noffense conduct.25 Parents of two of the decedents also made statements at the\n\nproceeding, describing the emotional impact that the losses had on them and\n\ntheir families.\n\n      In the course of explaining its reasons for choosing Ulbricht’s sentence, the\n\ndistrict court discussed the facts of Ulbricht’s offense, his apparent character, and\n\nthe purposes of criminal punishment. The court described Doctor X as\n\n“enabling,” App’x 1530, rather than reducing the harms associated with drug\n\nuse, emphasized the social costs attendant to expanding the scope of the drug\n\nmarket, discussed the five murders for hire, and stated that the sentence imposed\n\non Ulbricht could have a powerful general deterrent effect because the case had\n\n\n\n\n25\n  The district court did not specifically address one of the six deaths. That\ndecedent was a frequent Silk Road customer who was found dead in his home\nwith a used syringe and other drug paraphernalia. The record does not indicate\nwhy the district court did not discuss that case, and neither party makes any\nargument based on that omission.\n\n                                         34\n\fattracted an unusually large amount of publicity. The court then sentenced\n\nUlbricht principally to life imprisonment.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, Ulbricht raises a number of claims of error. For purposes of\n\norganizational clarity, we group them into three categories, and present them in\n\nthe order in which the issues arose in the district court. Accordingly, we discuss\n\nfirst Ulbricht’s claims that much of the evidence against him should have been\n\nsuppressed because it was obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights;\n\nsecond, his arguments that the district court’s evidentiary errors denied him a\n\nfair trial; and third, his objections to his sentence.\n\nI.    Fourth Amendment Issues\n\n      Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to\n\nsuppress evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. On appeal\n\nfrom a denial of a suppression motion, “we review a district court’s findings of\n\nfact for clear error, and its resolution of questions of law and mixed questions of\n\nlaw and fact de novo.” United States v. Bohannon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247-48 (2d Cir.\n\n2016). Ulbricht raises two principal arguments. First, he contends that the\n\n\n                                           35\n\fpen/trap orders that the government used to monitor IP address traffic to and\n\nfrom his home router violated the Fourth Amendment because the government\n\nobtained the orders without a warrant. Second, he claims that the warrants\n\nauthorizing the government to search his laptop as well as his Google and\n\nFacebook accounts violated the Fourth Amendment’s particularity requirement.\n\nWe reject those contentions and affirm the denial of Ulbricht’s motion to\n\nsuppress.\n\n      A. Pen/Trap Orders\n\n      Pursuant to orders issued by United States magistrate judges in the\n\nSouthern District of New York, the government used five pen registers and trap\n\nand trace devices to monitor IP addresses associated with Internet traffic to and\n\nfrom Ulbricht’s wireless home router and devices that regularly connected to that\n\nrouter. The government obtained the orders pursuant to the Pen/Trap Act, which\n\nprovides that a government attorney “may make [an] application for an order . . .\n\nauthorizing or approving the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and\n\ntrace device . . . to a court of competent jurisdiction.” 18 U.S.C. § 3122(a)(1). A\n\n“pen register” is defined as a “device or process which records or decodes\n\ndialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an\n\n\n                                          36\n\finstrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is\n\ntransmitted,” and “shall not include the contents of any communication.” Id.\n\n§ 3127(3). A “trap and trace” device means “a device or process which captures\n\nthe incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number\n\nor other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely\n\nto identify the source of a wire or electronic communication.” Id. § 3127(4). Like\n\npen registers, trap and trace devices may not capture the “contents of any\n\ncommunication.” Id. The statute does not require a search warrant for the use of a\n\npen register or trap and trace device, nor does it demand the kind of showing\n\nrequired to obtain such a warrant. Rather, the statute requires only that the\n\napplication contain a “certification . . . that the information likely to be obtained is\n\nrelevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.” Id. § 3122(b)(2).\n\n      The orders in this case authorized the government to “use a pen register\n\nand trap and trace device to identify the source and destination [IP] addresses,\n\nalong with the dates, times, durations, ports of transmission, and any\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (‘TCP’) connection data,26 associated with any\n\n\n26\n  Data are transmitted on the Internet via discrete packets, rather than in a\ncontinuous stream. TCP is a “communications protocol used to process such data\npackets associated with popular Internet applications,” such as browser and e-\n\n                                          37\n\felectronic communications sent to or from” various devices, including Ulbricht’s\n\nhome wireless router and his laptop.27 S.A. 93. In each order, the government\n\nspecified that it did not seek to obtain the contents of any communications.\n\nInstead, it sought authorization to collect only “dialing, routing, addressing, and\n\nsignaling information” that was akin to data captured by “traditional telephonic\n\npen registers and trap and trace devices.” Id. at 130. Ulbricht claims that the\n\npen/trap orders violated the Fourth Amendment because he had a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy in the IP address routing information that the orders\n\nallowed the government to collect.28\n\n\nmail applications. S.A. 97. Like IP address data, the TCP data that the orders\npermitted the government to acquire do not include the contents of\ncommunications, and Ulbricht has not expressed any independent concern over\nthe government’s collection of TCP connection data.\n27\n  Some of the pen/trap orders phrased the scope of the order slightly differently.\nFor example, one order authorized installing “a trap and trace device to identify\nthe source [IP] address of any Internet communications directed to, and a pen\nregister to determine the destination IP addresses of any Internet\ncommunications originating from,” the relevant devices. S.A. 67. In other words,\nnot every order sought TCP connection data as well as IP address information.\nNeither party has suggested that the differences among the pen/trap orders are\nmaterial to any issue presented by this appeal.\n28\n  In the district court, Ulbricht made the same arguments concerning his Fourth\nAmendment privacy interest in the information captured by the pen registers\nand trap and trace devices. The district court ruled generally that the “type of\ninformation sought [in the orders] was entirely appropriate for that type of\n\n                                         38\n\f       The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that:\n\n“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\n\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\n\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\n\nand particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to\n\nbe seized.” The “cornerstone of the modern law of searches is the principle that,\n\nto mount a successful Fourth Amendment challenge, a defendant must\n\ndemonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place\n\nsearched.” United States v. Haqq, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776282\"><a href=\"/opinion/776282/united-states-v-samad-haqq/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).

The court declined to address Ulbricht’s “novel Fourth\nAmendment arguments” regarding the pen/trap devices because he had “not\nestablished the requisite privacy interest . . . to” demonstrate his standing to\nchallenge the orders. Id. The government has agreed that Ulbricht has standing to\npursue his Fourth Amendment arguments on appeal.\n\n                                          39\n\fincluding phone numbers dialed in making a telephone call and captured by a\n\npen register.

This is so because\n\nphone users “typically know that they must convey numerical information to the\n\nphone company; that the phone company has facilities for recording this\n\ninformation; and that the phone company does in fact record this information for\n\na variety of legitimate business purposes.” Id. at 743.

See, e.g., United States v.

We remain bound, however, by that rule until and\n\nunless it is overruled by the Supreme Court. See United States v.

The\n\nrecording of IP address information and similar routing data, which reveal the\n\nexistence of connections between communications devices without disclosing the\n\ncontent of the communications, are precisely analogous to the capture of\n\ntelephone numbers at issue in Smith. That is why the orders here fit comfortably\n\nwithin the language of a statute drafted with the earlier technology in mind. The\n\nsubstitution of electronic methods of communication for telephone calls does not\n\nalone create a reasonable expectation of privacy in the identities of devices with\n\nwhom one communicates. Nor does it raise novel issues distinct from those long\n\nsince resolved in the context of telephone communication, with which society has\n\n\n                                           41\n\flived for the nearly forty years since Smith was decided. Like telephone\n\ncompanies, Internet service providers require that identifying information be\n\ndisclosed in order to make communication among electronic devices possible. In\n\nlight of the Smith rule, no reasonable person could maintain a privacy interest in\n\nthat sort of information.\n\n      We therefore join the other circuits that have considered this narrow\n\nquestion and hold that collecting IP address information devoid of content is\n\n“constitutionally indistinguishable from the use of a pen register.” Forrester, 512\n\nF.3d at 510; see, e.g., Wheelock, 772 F.3d at 828 (holding that the defendant “cannot\n\nclaim a reasonable expectation of privacy in [the] government’s acquisition of his\n\nsubscriber information, including his IP address and name,” because it had been\n\n“revealed to a third party” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Christie, 624 F.3d\n\nat 573 (holding that there is no expectation of privacy in “subscriber information\n\nprovided to an internet provider,” such as an IP address (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)); see also Guest v.

Where, as here, the government did not\n\naccess the contents of any of Ulbricht’s communications, it did not need to obtain\n\na warrant to collect IP address routing information in which Ulbricht did not\n\nhave a legitimate privacy interest. We therefore reject Ulbricht’s contention that\n\nthe issuance of such orders violated his Fourth Amendment rights.29\n\n\n\n29\n  The issue presented in this case is narrowly confined to orders that are limited\nto the capture of IP addresses, TCP connection data, and similar routing\ninformation.

Ulbricht contends\n\ngenerally that pen/trap orders may monitor a communication’s content by\n\ntracking metadata, but he does not identify what metadata the government might\n\nhave collected or explain how the pen/trap orders in this case gave the\n\ngovernment information concerning the content of his communications. He also\n\nclaims that the orders violated the Fourth Amendment by impermissibly\n\nmonitoring activity within his home, relying on Kyllo v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118443\"><a href=\"/opinion/118443/kyllo-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2001). In Kyllo, the Court held that using thermal-imaging technology from\n\noutside the home to discern whether a person was growing marijuana in the\n\nhome might reveal innocent, non-criminal information in which a resident has a\n\nprivacy interest. Id. at 38. Ulbricht contends that monitoring IP address traffic\n\nthrough his router is similar to the thermal-imaging technology because it might\n\nreveal when and how Ulbricht used his computer when he was at home. The\n\nsame can be said, however, of an ordinary telephone pen register, which can\n\nreveal if, when, and how a person uses his or her home phone to make calls. See\n\nSmith, 442 U.S. at 743. IP address traffic similarly reveals whether an Internet\n\nsubscriber (or, more precisely, a person who uses the subscriber’s Internet\n\nconnection) is home and using the Internet. Nothing in Kyllo suggests that\n\n\n                                         44\n\fgovernment monitoring of data disclosed to an outside telephone or Internet\n\nprovider for ordinary business purposes becomes constitutionally suspect when\n\ninvestigators use that information to draw inferences about whether someone is\n\nmaking telephone calls or accessing websites from inside his or her home. We\n\ntherefore see no constitutional difference between monitoring home phone\n\ndialing information and IP address routing data. Thus, we conclude that the pen\n\nregister and trap and trace orders did not violate the Fourth Amendment.30\n\n      B. Search Warrants\n\n      Ulbricht also contends that the warrants authorizing the search and seizure\n\nof his laptop as well as his Facebook and Google accounts violated the Fourth\n\n\n\n30\n  Ulbricht’s alternative argument, that the pen/trap orders violated the Pen/Trap\nAct and the Stored Communications Act (“SCA”) because they sought\nprospective data, is without merit. Ulbricht claims that the orders were obtained\nboth through the Pen/Trap Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-27, and the SCA, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2703(d). To the contrary, each pen/trap order (and the underlying requests for\nsuch orders) relied exclusively on the Pen/Trap Act, not the SCA. The fact that\none of the government’s goals was to monitor IP address traffic to match\nUlbricht’s Internet activity with DPR’s does not undermine the validity of the\norders. The orders themselves did not allow the government to track the location\nof the router and other equipment to which the trap and trace device was\nattached. Thus, they were not “geo-locating” devices, as Ulbricht suggests, any\nmore than subpoenas for hotel registers, parking tickets, and credit card receipts,\nor any other methods by which the government obtains information that can be\nused to identify a suspect’s location at particular points in time.\n\n                                        45\n\fAmendment’s particularity requirement. The Fourth Amendment explicitly\n\ncommands that warrants must be based on probable cause and must\n\n“particularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\n\nseized.” U.S. Const. amend.

First, “a warrant must identify the specific offense for\n\nwhich the police have established probable cause.” United States v.

Finally, the “warrant must specify the items to be seized\n\nby their relation to designated crimes.” Id. at 446 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      “Where, as here, the property to be searched is a computer hard drive, the\n\nparticularity requirement assumes even greater importance.” Id. A general search\n\nof electronic data is an especially potent threat to privacy because hard drives\n\nand e-mail accounts may be “akin to a residence in terms of the scope and\n\nquantity of private information [they] may contain.” Id. The “seizure of a\n\ncomputer hard drive, and its subsequent retention by the government, can\n\n[therefore] give the government possession of a vast trove of personal\n\ninformation about the person to whom the drive belongs, much of which may be\n\nentirely irrelevant to the criminal investigation that led to the seizure.” United\n\nStates v.

Because of the nature of digital storage, it is not\n\nalways feasible to “extract and segregate responsive data from non-responsive\n\ndata,” id. at 213, creating a “serious risk that every warrant for electronic\n\ninformation will become, in effect, a general warrant,” Galpin, 720 F.3d at 447\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we have held that warrants that fail to\n\n“link [the evidence sought] to the criminal activity supported by probable cause”\n\ndo not satisfy the particularity requirement because they “lack[] meaningful\n\nparameters on an otherwise limitless search” of a defendant’s electronic media.\n\nUnited States v. Rosa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178085\"><a href=\"/opinion/178085/united-states-v-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (2d Cir. 2010).\n\n      The Fourth Amendment does not require a perfect description of the data\n\nto be searched and seized, however. Search warrants covering digital data may\n\ncontain “some ambiguity . . . so long as law enforcement agents have done the\n\nbest that could reasonably be expected under the circumstances, have acquired\n\nall the descriptive facts which a reasonable investigation could be expected to\n\ncover, and have insured that all those facts were included in the warrant.” Galpin,\n\n720 F.3d at 446 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\f      Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that a search warrant does not\n\nnecessarily lack particularity simply because it is broad. Since a search of a\n\ncomputer is “akin to [a search of] a residence,” id., searches of computers may\n\nsometimes need to be as broad as searches of residences pursuant to warrants.\n\nSimilarly, traditional searches for paper records, like searches for electronic\n\nrecords, have always entailed the exposure of records that are not the objects of\n\nthe search to at least superficial examination in order to identify and seize those\n\nrecords that are. And in many cases, the volume of records properly subject to\n\nseizure because of their evidentiary value may be vast. None of these\n\nconsequences necessarily turns a search warrant into a prohibited general\n\nwarrant.\n\n             1. Laptop Search Warrant\n\n      The warrant authorizing the search and seizure of Ulbricht’s laptop (the\n\n“Laptop Warrant”) explicitly incorporated by reference an affidavit listing the\n\ncrimes charged, which at the time included narcotics trafficking, computer\n\nhacking, money laundering, and murder-for-hire offenses in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030, 1956, and 1958. See In re 650 Fifth Ave. & Related\n\nProperties, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (2d Cir. 2016) (describing the requirements for a\n\n\n                                          49\n\fcriminal search warrant’s incorporation of an affidavit by reference).32 The\n\naffidavit also described the workings of Silk Road and the role of Dread Pirate\n\nRoberts in operating the site and included a wealth of information supporting a\n\nfinding that there was probable cause to believe that Ulbricht and DPR were the\n\nsame person. Based on that information, the Laptop Warrant alleged that\n\nUlbricht “use[d] [the laptop] in connection with his operation of Silk Road,” and\n\nthat there was “probable cause to believe that evidence, fruits, and\n\ninstrumentalities of the [charged offenses]” would be found on the laptop. S.A.\n\n246.33\n\n         Generally speaking, the Laptop Warrant divided the information to be\n\nsearched for and seized into two categories. The first covered evidence\n\nconcerning Silk Road that was located on the computer, including, inter alia,\n\n“data associated with the Silk Road website, such as web content, server code, or\n\ndatabase records”; any evidence concerning servers or computer equipment\n\nconnected with Silk Road; e-mails, private messages, and forum postings or\n\n\n32\n Because the warrant incorporated the affidavit by reference, we refer to the\ndocuments together as the Laptop Warrant for the sake of simplicity.\n33\n  Ulbricht does not challenge the existence of probable cause to believe both that\nhe committed these offenses and that the laptop would contain evidence of them.\n\n                                         50\n\f“other communications concerning Silk Road in any way”; evidence concerning\n\n“funds used to facilitate or proceeds derived from Silk Road,” including Bitcoin\n\nwallet files and transactions with Bitcoin exchangers, or “information concerning\n\nany financial accounts . . . where Silk Road funds may be stored”; and “any\n\nevidence concerning any illegal activity associated with Silk Road.” Id. at 246-48.\n\n      The second category of information in the Laptop Warrant included\n\n“evidence relevant to corroborating the identification of Ulbricht as the Silk Road\n\nuser ‘Dread Pirate Roberts.’” Id. at 248. In order to connect Ulbricht with DPR,\n\nthe Laptop Warrant authorized agents to search for: “any communications or\n\nwritings by Ulbricht, which may reflect linguistic patterns or idiosyncra[s]ies\n\nassociated with ‘Dread Pirate Roberts,’ or political/economic views associated\n\nwith [DPR] . . .”; “any evidence concerning any computer equipment, software,\n\nor usernames used by Ulbricht, to allow comparison with” computer equipment\n\nused by DPR; “any evidence concerning Ulbricht’s travel or patterns of\n\nmovement, to allow comparison with patterns of online activity of [DPR]”; “any\n\nevidence concerning Ulbricht’s technical expertise concerning Tor, Bitcoins,” and\n\nother computer programming issues; any evidence concerning Ulbricht’s\n\nattempts to “obtain fake identification documents,” use aliases, or otherwise\n\n\n                                         51\n\fevade law enforcement; and “any other evidence implicating Ulbricht in the\n\nsubject offenses.” Id. at 248-49 (footnote omitted).\n\n      After careful consideration of the warrant, the supporting affidavit, and\n\nUlbricht’s arguments, we conclude that the Laptop Warrant did not violate the\n\nFourth Amendment’s particularity requirement.34 We note, at the outset of our\n\nreview, that the warrant plainly satisfies the basic elements of the particularity\n\nrequirement as traditionally understood. By incorporating the affidavit by\n\nreference, the Laptop Warrant lists the charged crimes, describes the place to be\n\nsearched, and designates the information to be seized in connection with the\n\nspecified offenses. Each category of information sought is relevant to Silk Road,\n\nDPR’s operation thereof, or identifying Ulbricht as DPR. We do not understand\n\nUlbricht’s arguments to contest the Laptop Warrant’s basic compliance with\n\nthose requirements.35\n\n\n34\n  The district court ruled that Ulbricht did not have standing to raise his Fourth\nAmendment challenges because he did not establish that he had a personal\nexpectation of privacy in the laptop or his Facebook and Google accounts. We\nexpress no view on that issue, since the district court also reached the merits of\nthe motion to suppress and the government has agreed that Ulbricht has\nstanding to challenge the warrants and accompanying searches.\n35\n It is worth noting that Ulbricht does not challenge the validity of the search\nwarrant covering his home, although that warrant is quite similar to the Laptop\n\n                                          52\n\f      Rather, Ulbricht’s arguments turn on the special problems associated with\n\nsearches of computers which, as we have acknowledged in prior cases, Galpin,\n\n720 F.3d at 447; Ganias, 824 F.3d at 217-18, can be particularly intrusive. These\n\narguments merit careful attention. For example, Ulbricht questions the\n\nappropriateness of the protocols that the Laptop Warrant instructed officers to\n\nuse in executing the search. Those procedures included opening or “cursorily\n\nreading the first few” pages of files to “determine their precise contents,”\n\nsearching for deliberately hidden files, using “key word searches through all\n\nelectronic storage areas,” and reviewing file “directories” to determine what was\n\nrelevant. S.A. 253. Ulbricht, supported by amicus the National Association of\n\nCriminal Defense Lawyers (“NACDL”), argues that the warrant was\n\ninsufficiently particular because the government and the magistrate judge failed\n\nto specify the search terms and protocols ex ante in the warrant.\n\n      We cannot agree. As illustrated by the facts of this very case, it will often\n\nbe impossible to identify in advance the words or phrases that will separate\n\nrelevant files or documents before the search takes place, because officers cannot\n\n\nWarrant and appears to be just as broad. Specifically, the home search warrant\nallows the government to search for and seize evidence concerning Ulbricht’s\ntravel or patterns of movement and any of his communications or writings.\n\n                                         53\n\freadily anticipate how a suspect will store information related to the charged\n\ncrimes. Files and documents can easily be given misleading or coded names, and\n\nwords that might be expected to occur in pertinent documents can be encrypted;\n\neven very simple codes can defeat a pre-planned word search. For example, at\n\nleast one of the folders on Ulbricht’s computer had a name with the misspelling\n\n“aliaces.” App’x 309. For a more challenging example, Ulbricht also kept records\n\nof certain Tor chats in a file on his laptop that was labeled “mbsobzvkhwx4hmjt.”\n\nId. at 398.36\n\n       The agents reasonably anticipated that they would face such problems in\n\nthis case. Operating Silk Road involved using sophisticated technology to mask\n\nits users’ identities. Accordingly, although we acknowledge the NACDL’s\n\nsuggestions in its amicus submission for limiting the scope of such search terms,\n\nthe absence of the proposed limitations does not violate the particularity\n\n\n36\n  We note that Ulbricht and amicus NACDL somewhat exaggerate the novelty of\ncomputer searches in this regard. A traditional physical search for paper “drug\nrecords” or “tax records” may entail a similar examination of all sorts of files and\npapers to determine whether such records are hidden in files with innocuous or\nmisleading names or written in coded terms to mask their content. For obvious\nreasons, search warrants authorizing the seizure of such evidence have not\ntraditionally specified that agents may look only at file folders labeled “drug\nrecords” or may seize only papers containing the word “cocaine”—the\nequivalent of the ex ante “search terms” demanded by Ulbricht.\n\n                                         54\n\frequirement on the facts of this case. We therefore conclude that, in preparing the\n\nLaptop Warrant, “law enforcement agents [did] the best that could reasonably be\n\nexpected under the circumstances, [had] acquired all the descriptive facts which\n\na reasonable investigation could be expected to cover, and [had] insured that all\n\nthose facts were included in the warrant.” Galpin, 720 F.3d at 446 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      The fundamental flaw in Ulbricht’s (and the NACDL’s) argument is that it\n\nconfuses a warrant’s breadth with a lack of particularity. As noted above, breadth\n\nand particularity are related but distinct concepts. A warrant may be broad, in\n\nthat it authorizes the government to search an identified location or object for a\n\nwide range of potentially relevant material, without violating the particularity\n\nrequirement. For example, a warrant may allow the government to search a\n\nsuspected drug dealer’s entire home where there is probable cause to believe that\n\nevidence relevant to that activity may be found anywhere in the residence.\n\nSimilarly, “[w]hen the criminal activity pervades [an] entire business, seizure of\n\nall records of the business is appropriate, and broad language used in warrants\n\nwill not offend the particularity requirements.” U.S. Postal Serv. v. C.E.C. Servs.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519237\"><a href=\"/opinion/519237/united-states-postal-service-v-cec-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187 (2d Cir. 1989). Ulbricht used his laptop to commit the charged\n\n\n                                          55\n\foffenses by creating and continuing to operate Silk Road. Thus, a broad warrant\n\nallowing the government to search his laptop for potentially extensive evidence\n\nof those crimes does not offend the Fourth Amendment, as long as that warrant\n\nmeets the three particularity criteria outlined above.\n\n      It is also true that allowing law enforcement to search his writings for\n\nlinguistic similarities with DPR authorizes a broad search of written materials on\n\nUlbricht’s hard drive. That fact, however, does not mean that the warrants\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. The Laptop Warrant clearly explained that the\n\ngovernment planned to compare Ulbricht’s writings to DPR’s posts to confirm\n\nthat they were the same person, by identifying both linguistic patterns and\n\ndistinctive shared political or economic views. Ulbricht and the NACDL similarly\n\nclaim that searching for all evidence of his travel patterns and movement violates\n\nthe Fourth Amendment’s particularity requirement. Again, the warrant\n\nexplained that it sought information about Ulbricht’s travel “to allow comparison\n\nwith patterns of online activity of ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ and any information\n\nknown about his location at particular times.” S.A. 248. Thus, the Laptop Warrant\n\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\fconnects the information sought to the crimes charged and, more specifically, its\n\nrelevance to identifying Ulbricht as the perpetrator of those crimes.37\n\n      We remain sensitive to the difficulties associated with preserving a\n\ncriminal defendant’s privacy while searching through his electronic data and\n\ncomputer hard drives. In the course of searching for information related to Silk\n\nRoad and DPR, the government may indeed have come across personal\n\ndocuments that were unrelated to Ulbricht’s crimes. Such an invasion of a\n\ncriminal defendant’s privacy is inevitable, however, in almost any warranted\n\nsearch because in “searches for papers, it is certain that some innocuous\n\ndocuments will be examined, at least cursorily, in order to determine whether\n\n\n37\n  Evidence revealing a suspect’s past movements is often highly relevant to a\ncriminal investigation. Such evidence might be used to establish—or rule\nout—the suspect’s presence at a crime scene or other pertinent location at a\nparticular time. It may also disclose other, unrelated information about the\nsuspect’s non-criminal associations, interests, and behavior, and may be drawn\nfrom a wide variety of sources. Government efforts to develop such information,\nincluding by search warrants authorizing its seizure, are not inherently\nquestionable under the Fourth Amendment. Using piecemeal or laborious\ninvestigative techniques, it might take law enforcement officers a great deal of\ntime and effort to compile a comprehensive record of a suspect’s travel or other\nmovements. The fact that extensive travel records are stored on a digital device\nand may be accessed readily via a keystroke or quick search does not immunize\nthose records from seizure. Indeed, the seizure of a paper journal or calendar in a\nconventional search will often allow officers to map out a defendant’s travel\nhistory with similar ease.\n\n                                         57\n\fthey are, in fact, among those papers authorized to be seized.” Ganias, 824 F.3d at\n\n211, quoting Andresen, 427 U.S. at 482 n.11. The Fourth Amendment limits such\n\n“unwarranted intrusions upon privacy,” id. (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\nby requiring a warrant to describe its scope with particularity. The Laptop\n\nWarrant satisfied that requirement. Ulbricht has challenged only the facial\n\nvalidity of the Laptop Warrant and not its execution. Because we have no reason\n\nto doubt that the officers faithfully executed the warrant, its execution did not\n\nresult in an undue invasion of Ulbricht’s privacy.\n\n      Finally, we note that the crimes charged in this case were somewhat\n\nunusual. This case does not involve a more typical situation in which officers\n\nsearched for evidence of a physician’s illegal distribution of pain medications, to\n\nuse the NACDL’s example, which may have electronically-stored data associated\n\nwith the alleged crimes on a hard drive that largely contains non-criminal\n\ninformation. Here the crimes under investigation were committed largely\n\nthrough computers that there was probable cause to believe included the laptop\n\nat issue, and the search warrant application gave ample basis for the issuing\n\nmagistrate judge to conclude that evidence related to Silk Road and Ulbricht’s\n\nuse of the DPR username likely permeated Ulbricht’s computer. Thus, given the\n\n\n                                         58\n\fnature of Ulbricht’s crimes and their symbiotic connection to his digital devices,\n\nwe decline to rethink the well-settled Fourth Amendment principles that the\n\nLaptop Warrant may implicate. A future case may require this Court to articulate\n\nspecial limitations on digital searches to effectuate the Fourth Amendment’s\n\nparticularity or reasonableness requirements. Such a case is not before us.\n\n             2. The Google and Facebook Warrants\n\n      Ulbricht also challenges the warrants that allowed the government to\n\nsearch his Google and Facebook accounts, although he does not present any\n\nspecific arguments related to those warrants. Both warrants, through affidavits\n\nincorporated by reference, set forth the basis for probable cause to search those\n\naccounts for evidence of Ulbricht’s involvement in Silk Road. The warrants also\n\nauthorized the government to search his Google and Facebook accounts for\n\n“evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities” of the specified offenses, including, inter\n\nalia: “any communications or writings by Ulbricht”; “any evidence concerning\n\nany computer equipment, software, or usernames used by Ulbricht”; “any\n\nevidence concerning Ulbricht’s travel or patterns of movement”; and any “other\n\nevidence of the” crimes charged. S.A. 334-35, 393-94. The scope of the Google and\n\nFacebook warrants thus substantially paralleled that of the Laptop Warrant.\n\n\n                                         59\n\f      The Google and Facebook warrants were constitutional for the same\n\nreasons that the Laptop Warrant was valid. They satisfied all three of the\n\nparticularity requirements because they listed the subject offenses, described the\n\nthings to be searched, and identified the information to be seized in relation to\n\nthe charged crimes. Ulbricht does not advance any additional arguments specific\n\nto the Google and Facebook warrants, nor have we identified any independent\n\nreason to find them unconstitutionally lacking in specificity.\n\n             3. Conclusion\n\n      In sum, the issuance of the pen/trap orders and the three search warrants\n\nthat Ulbricht challenges in this appeal did not violate the Fourth Amendment.38\n\nThus, we affirm the district court’s denial of Ulbricht’s suppression motion.\n\nII.   The District Court’s Trial Rulings and Ulbricht’s Rule 33 Motion\n\n      Ulbricht contends that he did not receive a fair trial for several reasons:\n\n(1) the district court’s rulings surrounding corrupt agents Force and Bridges\n\n\n38\n  The government also contends that, even if the warrants were invalid, the good\nfaith exception prevents the application of the exclusionary rule. In general, the\n“exclusion of evidence is inappropriate when the government acts in objectively\nreasonable reliance on a search warrant, even when the warrant is subsequently\ninvalidated.” Ganias, 824 F.3d at 221 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because\nwe conclude that all three of the warrants were valid, we need not address the\ngovernment’s alternative argument.\n\n                                         60\n\fviolated his due process rights; (2) the district court erroneously precluded two\n\ndefense experts from testifying; (3) the district court abused its discretion when it\n\ncurtailed Ulbricht’s cross-examination of two government witnesses; and (4) the\n\ndistrict court erred when it ruled that certain hearsay statements were\n\ninadmissible. He also contends that, even if each individual error is harmless, the\n\ncumulative effect of those errors prejudiced him to the extent that his trial was\n\nfundamentally unfair. We detect no error in the district court’s rulings on any of\n\nthose issues and therefore conclude that Ulbricht was not deprived of his right to\n\na fair trial.\n\n       A. Corrupt Agents Force and Bridges\n\n       Ulbricht’s principal fair trial argument is that the district court erred in\n\nnumerous ways by preventing him from relying on information related to the\n\ncorruption of two federal agents, Force and Bridges, involved in the investigation\n\nof the Silk Road site. Before trial, the district court (1) precluded Ulbricht from\n\nreferring at trial to the secret grand jury proceeding against Force; (2) denied\n\nUlbricht discovery related to the Force investigation; and (3) denied Ulbricht an\n\nadjournment of the trial until the Force investigation was complete. During trial,\n\nthe district court excluded as hearsay certain chats that related to Force’s illicit\n\n\n                                           61\n\fuse of Silk Road. Finally, Ulbricht learned after trial that the government was\n\ninvestigating a second corrupt agent, Bridges. Ulbricht contends that the failure\n\nto disclose Bridges’s corruption until after the trial violated Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963), and that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a new\n\ntrial on that ground.\n\n      Without question, the shocking personal corruption of these two\n\ngovernment agents disgraced the agencies for which they worked and\n\nembarrassed the many honorable men and women working in those agencies to\n\ninvestigate serious criminal wrongdoing. Even more importantly, when law\n\nenforcement officers abuse their offices for personal gain, commit other criminal\n\nacts, violate the rights of citizens, or lie under oath, they undermine the public’s\n\nvital trust in the integrity of law enforcement. They may also compromise the\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions on which they work.\n\n      At the same time, the venality of individual agents does not necessarily\n\naffect the reliability of the government’s evidence in a particular case or become\n\nrelevant to the adjudication of every case in which the agents participated. Courts\n\nare obligated to ensure that probative evidence is disclosed to the defense,\n\ncarefully evaluated by the court for its materiality to the case, and submitted for\n\n\n                                         62\n\fthe jury’s consideration where admissible. But courts must also take care that\n\nwrongdoing by investigators that has no bearing on the matter before the court\n\nnot be used as a diversion from fairly assessing the prosecution’s case. Like any\n\nother potential evidence, information about police corruption must be evaluated\n\nby reference to the ordinary rules of criminal procedure and evidence, a task to\n\nwhich we now turn.\n\n             1. Background: Pretrial Disclosure of the Force Investigation\n\n      The government disclosed its investigation into Force’s corruption to the\n\ndefense about six weeks before trial. Initially, on November 21, 2014, the\n\ngovernment wrote a sealed ex parte letter to the district court seeking permission\n\nto disclose to the defense information about the Force grand jury investigation\n\nsubject to a protective order.39 The district court granted the application. On\n\nDecember 1, the government provided a copy of the November 21 letter, which\n\notherwise remained sealed, to defense counsel. According to the letter, Force\n\nleaked information to DPR in exchange for payment and “corruptly obtain[ed]\n\n\n\n39\n  The government required such an order because grand jury proceedings are\nsecret and a government attorney “must not disclose a matter occurring before\nthe grand jury,” Rule 6(e)(2)(B)(vi), Fed. R. Crim. P., without a court order, Rule\n6(e)(3)(E), subject to limited exceptions not relevant here.\n\n                                         63\n\fproceeds from the Silk Road website and convert[ed] them to his personal\n\nuse.”App’x 649. The government then undertook to purge its trial evidence of\n\nanything arguably traceable to Force.\n\n      Ulbricht moved to unseal the entire November 21 letter so that he could\n\nrely on the information in the letter that related to Force’s corruption at trial,\n\narguing that the letter included Brady information and that he therefore had a\n\nparticularized need to disclose the information that outweighed the presumption\n\nof grand jury secrecy. He also requested discovery and subpoenas under Rules 16\n\nand 17, Fed. R. Crim. P., to learn more about the scope of Force’s corruption. In\n\nthe alternative, Ulbricht sought an adjournment of the trial until the Force\n\ninvestigation concluded and information about his corruption might become\n\npublic through the filing of charges against him. On December 15, the district\n\ncourt held a sealed hearing on that issue and invited further written submissions,\n\nincluding a particularized list of Ulbricht’s discovery requests. One week later,\n\nthe district court issued a sealed and partially redacted opinion40 denying all of\n\n\n40\n  Portions of the district court opinion were redacted because they referenced the\ndefendant’s ex parte submissions explaining how he would use information\nrelated to the Force investigation at trial. This Court has reviewed an unredacted\nversion of the district court opinion in connection with this appeal, but not the ex\nparte letters that the opinion references.\n\n                                          64\n\fUlbricht’s requests. The court did indicate, however, that throughout the trial it\n\nwould “entertain specific requests to use information from the November 21,\n\n2014 Letter on cross-examination.” App’x 700. Moreover, the court explained that\n\nit would “entertain a renewed application” for a “particularized disclosure” of\n\nfacts relevant to Force’s corruption if the government’s trial tactics or evidence\n\n“open[ed] the door” to such facts. Id.\n\n             2. Preclusion of Force Investigation Evidence: Rule 6(e)\n\n      On appeal, Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to unseal the November 21 letter because he demonstrated a\n\nparticularized need that rebutted the presumption of secrecy that attaches to\n\ngrand jury investigations. We disagree.\n\n      “[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the\n\nsecrecy of grand jury proceedings.” Douglas Oil Co. of California v.

To prove\n\na particularized need, parties seeking disclosure must show that the “material\n\nthey seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding,\n\nthat the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and\n\nthat their request is structured to cover only material so needed.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). “A district court’s decision as to whether the burden of\n\n\n                                          66\n\fshowing a particularized interest has been met will be overturned only if the\n\ncourt has abused its discretion.” Id.\n\n      We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion when it denied\n\nUlbricht’s request to unseal the November 21 letter discussing the Force grand\n\njury investigation. It is undisputed that the letter contained information related to\n\na grand jury proceeding that, if made public, would disclose matters occurring\n\nbefore the grand jury. Ulbricht did not demonstrate a particularized need for\n\ndisclosure because he did not show that the need for disclosure was greater than\n\nthe need for continued secrecy or that a possible injustice would result if the\n\ngrand jury investigation was not disclosed. Specifically, the district court did not\n\nerr in concluding that revealing the entire letter could have compromised the\n\nForce grand jury investigation in a number of ways. For example, potential co-\n\nconspirators might have learned of the investigation and attempted to intimidate\n\nwitnesses or destroy evidence. The investigation was also likely to garner\n\nsignificant media attention, a fact that might influence witnesses or grand jurors.\n\nAnd, although Force knew of the investigation, revealing its existence to the\n\npublic might have harmed him if the allegations had ultimately proved untrue.\n\nFinally, Ulbricht’s request was not structured to cover only the information\n\n\n                                         67\n\fneeded to avoid any possible injustice; instead, he sought to unseal the entire\n\nNovember 21 letter and did not propose a more narrowly tailored disclosure.\n\n      In redacted portions of its opinion, the district court also considered ex\n\nparte arguments concerning how the Force investigation might be relevant to\n\nUlbricht’s defense. In general terms, Ulbricht argued that the agents’ corruption\n\nwas critical to his defense because it would reveal the agents’ ability to falsify\n\nevidence against him and demonstrate their motive to do so. According to the\n\ndistrict court’s characterization of his ex parte letters, Ulbricht speculated that\n\nForce may have used Curtis Green’s (Flush) administrative capabilities to\n\nimpersonate DPR; Force’s corrupt conduct might have demonstrated technical\n\nvulnerabilities in the site that would render it susceptible to hacking; and\n\nlearning that Force had good information about the Silk Road investigation might\n\nhave caused the true DPR to recruit Ulbricht as his successor.41\n\n\n41\n  As noted above, see note 5, we have carefully considered to what extent it is\nappropriate to refer to portions of the record that remain under seal. We have\nbeen especially careful in describing the portions of the district court’s opinion\nthat remain redacted and therefore are still not available to the government or to\nthe public. We appreciate that charges against Ulbricht remain pending in\nMaryland and that the redacted information describes what would have been his\ntrial strategy had he been able to reference Force’s corruption. We have thus\ndescribed the defense’s redacted arguments at a fairly high level of generality.\nWe are confident that any experienced prosecutor could anticipate those\n\n                                          68\n\f      The district court reasoned that much of the information that might have\n\narguably supported any of those theories was made available to the defense in\n\ndiscovery. The only new information in the November 21 letter concerned the\n\ninvestigation of Force’s corruption; the fact of that investigation and its scope\n\ndoes not bolster any of the defense theories that Ulbricht described before the\n\ndistrict court or on appeal. That Force was personally corrupt and used his\n\nundercover identity to steal money from Silk Road and DPR does not suggest\n\neither a motive or an ability on his part to frame Ulbricht as DPR. Absent any\n\nexplanation of how Force could have orchestrated a massive plant of\n\nincriminating information on Ulbricht’s personal laptop, his larcenous behavior\n\ndoes not advance the claim that such a frame-up was possible beyond mere\n\n\n\n\narguments, and that in any event the information is largely stated or implied in\nUlbricht’s own publicly filed briefs on appeal. Particularly given that our\ndescription relates to how the Force information might have been used at a trial\nthat is now completed, and that we now hold that Ulbricht is not entitled to a\nnew trial, we conclude that the public’s need to understand and evaluate\nUlbricht’s arguments that he was unfairly prejudiced by the district court’s\nrulings, as well as our reasons for rejecting those arguments, outweighs any\nminimal interest that Ulbricht might have in withholding his contentions from\nthe government.\n\n                                         69\n\fspeculation. Thus, Ulbricht was equally capable of presenting his various defense\n\ntheories to the jury with or without the November 21 letter.42\n\n      The government’s commitment to eliminating all evidence that came from\n\nForce’s work on the Silk Road investigation43 further undermines Ulbricht’s claim\n\nthat he needed the information to avoid a possible injustice. Had Force been\n\ncalled as a government witness, or had any of the government’s evidence relied\n\non his credibility, his character for truthfulness would have been at issue during\n\nthe trial, and information that impeached his credibility would have become\n\nhighly relevant. Ulbricht’s reliance on the general fact of cooperation among\n\ndifferent government agencies and different U.S. Attorney’s Offices does not\n\nundermine the government’s explicit representations that none of the evidence\n\npresented at trial derived from Force, and nothing in the record suggests that\n\n\n\n\n42\n  Even on appeal, moreover, after the disclosure of additional information in the\nprosecutions of Bridges and Force, Ulbricht does not provide any concrete\nexplanation of how the techniques used by the corrupt agents to steal money\nfrom Silk Road could have been used, by them or by others, to plant the massive\namounts of incriminating information found on Ulbricht’s laptop and in his\nhouse.\n43\n  For example, the government declined to present evidence of DPR’s attempt to\ncommission an additional murder because that conduct involved Force acting as\nNob.\n\n                                        70\n\fthose representations were false. Ulbricht had no need to rely on the grand jury\n\ninvestigation of Force to attack the credibility of the actual government witnesses\n\nor the integrity of its other evidence.\n\n      In sum, Ulbricht has not shown that the district court abused its discretion\n\nin maintaining the secrecy of the Force grand jury investigation. He did not\n\ndemonstrate to the district court, and has not demonstrated on appeal, that\n\nkeeping the November 21 letter under seal resulted in any injustice, or that his\n\nneed for disclosing the investigation was greater than the need for continued\n\nsecrecy.44\n\n             3. Denial of Discovery Related to Force\n\n      Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying him discovery,\n\nincluding requested subpoenas, related to the Force investigation. Rule\n\n16(a)(1)(E), Fed. R. Crim. P., requires the government to disclose information\n\nwithin its control if the information is “material to preparing the defense” or will\n\n\n44\n  Moreover, the district court specifically ruled that it would entertain Ulbricht’s\napplications to rely on specific parts of the letter at trial if doing so would be\nnecessary for effective cross-examination. Thus, Ulbricht was given the\nopportunity to show particularized need in the context of specific trial evidence.\nUlbricht has not identified any point in the trial where he attempted to show that\nForce’s behavior had become relevant to challenging the credibility of particular\naspects of the prosecution’s case.\n\n                                          71\n\fbe a part of the government’s case-in-chief. Evidence is material if it “could be\n\nused to counter the government’s case or to bolster a defense.” United States v.\n\nStevens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600355\"><a href=\"/opinion/600355/united-states-v-david-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1180 (2d Cir. 1993). “An appellate court, in assessing the\n\nmateriality of withheld information, considers not only the logical relationship\n\nbetween the information and the issues in the case, but also the importance of the\n\ninformation in light of the evidence as a whole.” Id. To justify a new trial, there\n\n“must be some indication that the pretrial disclosure of the disputed evidence\n\nwould have enabled the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in\n\nhis favor.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Rule 17(c), Fed. R. Crim. P., allows parties to subpoena documents and\n\nobjects to be introduced at criminal trials. A subpoena must meet three criteria:\n\n“(1) relevancy; (2) admissibility; [and] (3) specificity.” United States v. Nixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 700 (1974). The party requesting the subpoena must also show that the\n\ninformation sought is “not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by\n\nexercise of due diligence,” that “the party cannot properly prepare for trial\n\nwithout such production,” and that “the application is made in good faith and is\n\nnot intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” Id. at 699-700. We review the\n\n\n\n\n                                           72\n\fdistrict court’s discovery rulings for abuse of discretion. United States v. Rigas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2467\"><a href=\"/opinion/2467/united-states-v-rigas/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125 (2d Cir. 2009).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Ulbricht’s\n\ndiscovery requests related to the Force investigation. Ulbricht submitted 28\n\nindividual discovery requests in connection with the Force disclosure. Those\n\nranged from the reasonably specific, such as “records from any and all Bitcoin\n\naccounts” used by Force, to the very broad, such as “any spending, net worth, or\n\nother financial analysis conducted with respect to former SA Force,” “any and all\n\nphone records relating to former SA Force,” and “bank account records from any\n\nand all bank accounts maintained by former SA Force or his spouse.” App’x 669-\n\n70. The district court concluded that those requests were too broad and\n\nunfocused, and that the information requested was not material in the Rule 16\n\nsense because the defense “has not articulated a coherent and particular reason\n\nwhy” the Force investigation could “counter the government’s case or bolster a\n\ndefense.” Id. at 697. Next, the district court concluded that the Rule 17 subpoenas\n\nwere part of the same overall fishing expedition and that the issuance of such\n\nsubpoenas could compromise the Force grand jury investigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                          73\n\f         There was no abuse of discretion in those rulings. Ulbricht has not shown\n\nthat, had the government produced every piece of requested information, he\n\nwould have been able to alter the quantum of proof in his favor at trial. That is so\n\nbecause there is no indication, beyond Ulbricht’s speculation, that Force\n\nmanufactured any of the evidence on which the government relied at trial, let\n\nalone the most damning evidence discovered on the hard drive on Ulbricht’s\n\nlaptop and at his apartment. Because Force did not testify at trial, information\n\nrelated to his corruption would not have been relevant to attack the credibility of\n\nany testimony he would have given. Moreover, Ulbricht has not identified any\n\nspecific aspect of the trial evidence that he could have undermined using the\n\nrequested information. Thus, even if the district court erred in not granting at\n\nleast some of Ulbricht’s discovery requests, any such error does not justify a new\n\ntrial.\n\n               4. Ulbricht’s Motion to Adjourn the Trial\n\n         Ulbricht contends that the district court erred in denying his request to\n\nadjourn the trial until the Force investigation was complete. “[A] district court\n\nhas a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials.” United States v. Griffiths, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, “trial courts\n\n\n                                           74\n\fenjoy very broad discretion in granting or denying trial continuances.” United\n\nStates v. Stringer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127 (2d Cir. 2013). A decision to grant or deny a\n\nrequest for an adjournment is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and we “will find\n\nno such abuse unless the denial was an arbitrary action that substantially\n\nimpaired the defense.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the party\n\nseeking a continuance has the burden of showing “both arbitrariness and\n\nprejudice in order to obtain reversal” based on a denial of an adjournment. Id. at\n\n128 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ulbricht’s request\n\nfor an adjournment of the trial. In a sealed portion of the proceedings on the first\n\nday of trial, the district court explained its reasons for denying the adjournment.\n\nThe court ruled that because none of the evidence revealed by the government\n\nconcerning Force’s corruption was exculpatory, there was no reason to believe\n\nthat delaying the trial would assist Ulbricht’s defense. That analysis was not\n\nirrational or arbitrary. Moreover, as explained in more detail both above and\n\nbelow, Ulbricht has not shown how information related to Force’s corruption was\n\neither exculpatory or material to his defense. Thus, he has not shown that the\n\n\n\n\n                                          75\n\fdistrict court’s refusal to adjourn the trial was prejudicial, let alone substantially\n\nso.\n\n             5. Preclusion of the DeathFromAbove Chats\n\n      As already described, Force used DeathFromAbove as an unauthorized\n\nSilk Road username through which he attempted to extort money from DPR. The\n\ngovernment only learned of Force’s activity as DeathFromAbove during trial,\n\nwhen the defense attempted to introduce a redacted chat between DPR and\n\nDeathFromAbove. In the chat at issue, DeathFromAbove implied that he knew\n\nthat DPR’s real identity was Anand Athavale. DeathFromAbove then attempted\n\nto blackmail DPR by saying that, if DPR gave him $250,000, he would not “give\n\nyou [sic] identity to law enforcement.” App’x 712.\n\n      The government objected to admitting the chat on three grounds: (1) it was\n\nhearsay; (2) its probative value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice\n\nunder Rule 403, Fed. R. Evid.; and (3) it was a “back-door attempt to re-inject”\n\nForce’s corruption into the defense’s trial evidence. App’x 707. The district court\n\nexcluded the chat as hearsay. At trial, Ulbricht claimed that the chat was not\n\nbeing offered for its truth, but instead to show its effect on DPR; that is, if DPR\n\nwas actually Athavale, one would expect DPR to take certain steps to protect his\n\n\n                                          76\n\fidentity. The district court disagreed and ruled that the DeathFromAbove chat\n\nwas hearsay because it was offered for the truth of the matter asserted\n\ntherein—that government agents at one time thought that Athavale was\n\nDPR—and it did not fall into any hearsay exceptions. In the alternative, the\n\ndistrict court found that the Athavale-as-DPR theory lacked sufficient support,\n\nwas speculative, and risked jury confusion.\n\n      In general, hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies. See Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 802. “The Federal Rules of Evidence define hearsay as a declarant’s\n\nout-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserted in the statement.” United States v. Dupree, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136 (2d Cir. 2013)\n\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). If “the significance of an\n\noffered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to\n\nthe truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). “The trial court’s ultimate decisions as to the\n\nadmission or exclusion of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion.” Davis v.\n\nVelez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (2d Cir. 2015).\n\n      The district court concluded that the DeathFromAbove chat was hearsay\n\nbecause it was an out-of-court statement being offered for the truth of the matter\n\n\n                                           77\n\fasserted therein. That ruling was not an abuse of discretion. Contrary to\n\nUlbricht’s assertions on appeal, the district court did not rest its decision on the\n\nneed for grand jury secrecy to protect the Force investigation. Instead, the\n\ndecision was a straightforward application of the rule against hearsay.\n\n      Ulbricht does not provide any detailed arguments to the contrary that are\n\nspecific to the DeathFromAbove chat; instead, he discusses the district court’s\n\npreclusion of all of the evidence related to the Force investigation collectively. At\n\ntrial, however, he claimed that the statement was offered only to demonstrate\n\n“the fact that it was communicated to DPR . . . in that this particular piece of\n\nevidence communicates to DPR the name and profile of the person\n\n[D]eath[F]rom[A]bove believes is DPR.” Tr. 1866. Ulbricht claimed that the\n\nstatement was “offered for the fact that DPR was getting information about\n\npeople who were supposed to be DPR,” and “one of these people is [Athavale].”\n\nId. at 1867. Once the district court expressed skepticism about his argument,\n\nUlbricht claimed that he sought to admit the chat to demonstrate its effect on\n\nDPR: “if you’re DPR and you get a name . . . this Anand Athavale and a profile\n\nand details . . . and you’re put on notice that it’s you, you’re going to take steps.”\n\nId. at 1867-68. In other words, Ulbricht claimed that he did not offer it for the\n\n\n                                          78\n\ftruth of the matter asserted in the chat: that agents in the Baltimore investigation,\n\nincluding Force, believed that Athavale was the real Dread Pirate Roberts, or that\n\nAthavale was in fact the real DPR.\n\n      Ulbricht’s proposed non-hearsay use of the chat—to show its effect on\n\nDPR—is not sufficiently probative that the evidence’s exclusion prejudiced him.\n\nThe statement does not appear to have had an effect on DPR that would bolster\n\nUlbricht’s defense. DPR did not alter his behavior in response to the extortion\n\nattempt. Indeed, he referred to it as “bogus” in one of the journal entries\n\ndiscovered on Ulbricht’s laptop. App’x 710. If Athavale had been the real Dread\n\nPirate Roberts, he likely would have had a different reaction to the threatened\n\nexposure of his identity. DPR’s reactions to other attempts to destroy the site’s\n\nanonymity were dramatic, and included hiring people to kill the users who\n\nthreatened to compromise Silk Road. Therefore, even if Ulbricht did not offer the\n\nchat for its truth, any relevance of the arguably non-hearsay use of the statement\n\nwas entirely too remote to outweigh the possible jury confusion that would result\n\nfrom the injection of Force into the trial or the likelihood that the jury would\n\nconfuse the hearsay and non-hearsay significance of the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         79\n\f             6. Ulbricht’s Rule 33 Motion: Brady v. Maryland\n\n      Ulbricht moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P., raising\n\nseveral issues concerning the unfairness of the assertedly belated disclosures of\n\nthe investigations into Force and Bridges.45 The only argument that he pursues in\n\nthis appeal is that the belated disclosures violated his due process rights under\n\nBrady because the information was both material and exculpatory.\n\n      Rule 33(a) provides that, on “the defendant’s motion, the court may vacate\n\nany judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” We have\n\nadvised district courts to “exercise Rule 33 authority sparingly and in the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances.” United States v.

Evidence concerning the agents’\n\ncorruption is not Brady information because it is not exculpatory or impeaching\n\nof the government’s trial evidence. For this reason, the government’s failure to\n\nreveal the full extent of the investigations until after Ulbricht’s trial did not\n\nprejudice him. As already explained, the fact that Force purloined Bitcoins from\n\nSilk Road and attempted to blackmail DPR does not relate to Ulbricht’s guilt or\n\ninnocence; the same logic applies to Bridges’s similar behavior. The agents’\n\ncorruption has nothing to do with whether Ulbricht operated the site as Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. Ulbricht has not raised any credible doubts about the reliability of\n\nthe evidence that the government presented at trial, nor has he explained why\n\n\n                                           82\n\fthe agents’ illegal actions relate to his guilt at all. Indeed, the government\n\nremoved from its exhibit list the items relevant to Force, including\n\ncommunications between Nob (his authorized undercover username) and DPR.\n\nThose communications included an instance in which DPR hired Nob to kill\n\nCurtis Green (Flush) as punishment for using his administrator status to steal\n\nBitcoins from Silk Road users. Ulbricht does not identify any particular evidence\n\nintroduced by the government at trial that is traceable to either Force or Bridges,\n\nor the admissibility of which depends on either agent’s integrity.\n\n      Ulbricht’s arguments to the contrary largely rest on speculation. First,\n\nUlbricht contends that the Silk Road investigations occurring in Baltimore and\n\nNew York were “[c]oordinated and [c]ombined,” suggesting that Force’s\n\ncorruption may have somehow infected the evidence that the New York office\n\nused in its prosecution. Appellant Br. 40. Ulbricht explains that the offices\n\ncommunicated frequently and shared information through emails and reports.\n\nAssuming that Ulbricht is correct, the fact that the Silk Road investigation took\n\nplace in several offices, one of which employed two corrupt agents, does not alter\n\nour analysis. Ulbricht still has not shown how the agents’ corrupt behavior is\n\nexculpatory as to him, even if Force and Bridges at times shared their work\n\n\n                                          83\n\fproduct with New York and that work product influenced the larger\n\ninvestigation. The relevant question, on which none of Ulbricht’s arguments casts\n\nany light or raises any doubt, is whether any particular item of evidence was\n\ntainted in some way by the misconduct of Bridges or Force.\n\n      Next, Ulbricht surmises that the agents may have fabricated evidence\n\nsuggesting that Ulbricht was DPR. In so arguing, Ulbricht implies that Force and\n\nBridges may have had sufficiently high-level administrator access to Silk Road to\n\nmanipulate the “financial, transactional, and communications infrastructure of\n\nthe Silk Road site.” Reply Br. 14. Nothing in the government’s disclosures, and\n\nnothing that Ulbricht identifies in the record or has produced from any\n\nindependent source, suggests that either Bridges or Force had such capacity.\n\nAbsent further detail or evidence that Force and Bridges were able to infiltrate\n\nDPR’s communications or transactions, Ulbricht’s argument is simply too\n\nspeculative to warrant a new trial. Ulbricht further claims that Bridges used\n\nsophisticated techniques to try to place blame on others for his corrupt conduct,\n\nreflecting a pattern of framing others for his own crimes. That fact alone does not\n\nsuggest that Bridges fabricated any evidence against Ulbricht or attempted to\n\nframe him. That Bridges undertook to deflect blame for things he had done does\n\n\n                                        84\n\fnot suggest any reason why Bridges would be motivated to frame Ulbricht for\n\nthings that DPR had done. Nor does Ulbricht explain how Bridges’s actions\n\nshould undermine our confidence in any of the specific evidence on which the\n\ngovernment relied at trial.46\n\n      Finally, Ulbricht submitted a supplemental appendix that included a\n\nnewly-discovered, unredacted report from the Joint Automated Booking System\n\n(“JABS”).47 In that report, under the heading “Arrested or Received Information,”\n\nForce is listed as the officer on the case, and the Baltimore DEA is listed as the\n\nrelevant agency. Ulbricht apparently means to suggest that this report shows that\n\nForce played a more pervasive role in the investigation than the government has\n\nacknowledged. In response, the government argues that Force was simply the\n\n\n\n\n46\n  In a footnote, Ulbricht claims that failing to disclose the full extent of the\nagents’ corruption deprived him of an opportunity to “attack[] the investigation\nas shoddy.” Kyles v. Whitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 442 n.13 (1995). Now that he has all of\nthe relevant information, he still does not explain how he might have\ndemonstrated deficiencies in the government’s investigation of his or one of the\nother initial suspects’ conduct that would undermine our confidence in the\nverdict.\n47\n  As the government explains, and Ulbricht does not dispute, JABS is a database\nmaintained by the United States Marshals Service that catalogues information\nregarding alleged offenders who have been arrested and booked by federal, state,\nor local law enforcement agencies.\n\n                                          85\n\fmost recent person to make changes to the JABS report by updating it to include\n\ninformation about Ulbricht’s family members and the pending charges in\n\nMaryland. In any event, the JABS report bearing Force’s name does not show\n\nhow information related to Force’s corruption exculpates Ulbricht. It merely\n\nconfirms that Force was a participant in the Baltimore Silk Road investigation\n\nand that he continued to be involved in the case after Ulbricht was arrested. In\n\nthe face of the entire record of the trial, in which the provenance of the\n\ngovernment’s evidence was exhaustively displayed without indication that Force\n\nwas responsible for any of it, this single report has little or no probative value.\n\n      In sum, we conclude that the Force and Bridges complaint did not contain\n\nBrady information because the agents’ corruption does not bear on Ulbricht’s\n\nguilt or innocence. Thus, any delay in the government’s disclosure of their\n\ncorruption did not violate Ulbricht’s due process rights.\n\n      B. Preclusion of Defense Experts\n\n      The district court precluded both of Ulbricht’s proposed expert witnesses\n\nfrom testifying because he did not timely or adequately disclose his intent to call\n\nthem under Rule 16, Fed. R. Crim. P. In general, the “defendant must, at the\n\ngovernment’s request, give to the government a written summary of any [expert]\n\n\n                                          86\n\ftestimony that a defendant intends to use. . . . This summary must describe the\n\nwitness’s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s\n\nqualifications.”48 Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). The purpose of the expert\n\ndisclosure requirement is to “minimize surprise that often results from\n\nunexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide\n\nthe opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s testimony\n\nthrough focused cross-examination.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, advisory committee’s\n\nnote to 1993 amendment. Indeed, “[w]ith increased use of both scientific and\n\nnonscientific expert testimony, one of counsel’s most basic discovery needs is to\n\nlearn that an expert is expected to testify.” Id.\n\n      If a party fails to comply with Rule 16, the district court has “broad\n\ndiscretion in fashioning a remedy,” which may include granting a continuance or\n\n“ordering the exclusion of evidence.” United States v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (2d\n\nCir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2)(A)-(D)\n\n(a district court may order “any other [remedy] that is just under the\n\ncircumstances”). We thus review the district court’s choice of remedy for abuse of\n\n\n\n48\n  It is undisputed that the government requested such disclosure on December\n29, 2014, two weeks before trial began.\n\n                                           87\n\fdiscretion. “In considering whether the district court abused its discretion, we\n\nlook to the reasons why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if\n\nany, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a\n\ncontinuance, and any other relevant circumstances.” Lee, 834 F.3d at 159 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the defense\n\nfrom calling its proposed experts. Not only were the disclosures late, more\n\nimportantly, they were plainly inadequate. Both disclosures merely listed general\n\nand in some cases extremely broad topics on which the experts might opine. For\n\nexample, the disclosures indicated that the experts would testify on general\n\ntopics, including: “the origins of Bitcoin,” “the various purposes and uses of\n\nBitcoin,” “the mechanics of Bitcoin transactions,” “the value of Bitcoin over time\n\nsince its inception,” “the concepts of Bitcoin speculating and Bitcoin mining,”\n\n“[g]eneral principles of internet security and vulnerabilities,” the “import of\n\nsome lines of PHP code provided to defense counsel in discovery,” and\n\n“[g]eneral principles of public-key cryptography,” among others. App’x 349, 360.\n\nThey did not summarize the experts’ opinions about those topics, let alone\n\ndescribe the bases for the experts’ opinions.\n\n\n                                          88\n\f      Indeed, although the listed topics certainly pertained generally to Silk\n\nRoad, the disclosures were so vague that it is difficult to discern whether the\n\nproffered expert testimony would have been at all relevant under Rules 401 and\n\n702(a), Fed. R. Evid.49 In his opposition to the government’s motion to preclude\n\nAntonopoulos, Ulbricht described the expert’s proposed testimony in more\n\ndetail, but he still did not disclose the opinions that the expert intended to offer.\n\nFor example, that supplemental disclosure indicated that an “[i]ndependent\n\ndefense investigation has uncovered that” the government’s claim that over\n\n700,000 Bitcoins were transferred to Ulbricht’s Bitcoin wallet “is implausible,”\n\nand the expert would “dispute this finding.” App’x 382. Although that is more\n\nspecific, it is not a summary of Antonopoulos’s opinion, nor does it identify the\n\nbasis for that opinion. Thus, to this day Ulbricht has not described what opinions\n\n\n\n49\n  In particular, Ulbricht’s disclosures did not discuss, and he has not described\non appeal, how one expert’s proposed testimony on “[g]eneral principles of\ninternet security and vulnerabilities” would have linked to the defense claim that\nthe damning documentary evidence of Ulbricht’s guilt found on his laptop was\nor could have been fabricated or planted. The jury was aware from other\nevidence, and indeed it is within ordinary lay experience, that various forms of\nhacking are possible. What was lacking, what the defense expert disclosures did\nnot purport to address, and what Ulbricht still has not provided on appeal, is any\nexplanation, let alone a credible explanation, of how the breadth and variety of\ninformation, from the laptop and other sources, could have been planted.\n\n                                          89\n\fthe experts would offer or explained the methods they used to arrive at any of\n\nthose conclusions.\n\n      The district court also did not abuse its discretion in finding that the\n\ngovernment would be prejudiced by the belated and inadequate disclosures, in\n\npart because the government was due to rest the following day, providing it with\n\nno time to prepare to respond to the experts. Moreover, the district court\n\nconsidered intermediate sanctions short of preclusion but found them to be\n\ninadequate. In rejecting a continuance as a possible remedy, the district court\n\nemphasized the “known issues with a continuance,” especially in a lengthy trial.\n\nId. at 369. Two of the jurors had time constraints, and a continuance might have\n\ncaused the court to lose one or both of those jurors, especially if the continuance\n\nwas lengthy. If it were to grant a continuance, the court would also need to\n\nperform its function as a gatekeeper of expert testimony under Daubert v. Merrell\n\nDow Pharm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 592-93 (1993), which requires the district court to\n\nmake a “preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology\n\nunderlying the [expert] testimony is scientifically valid” and “can be applied to\n\n\n\n\n                                         90\n\fthe facts in issue.”50 The district court cannot perform that complex evaluation of\n\nan expert’s proposed methodology without a clear articulation of what the\n\nexpert’s opinions are and, even more importantly, of the bases for those opinions.\n\nIn light of the risk of losing jurors and the lack of a sufficiently compelling reason\n\nfor the defense’s clear violation of Rule 16, the district court was within its\n\ndiscretion when it determined that a continuance was not practical and that the\n\nappropriate remedy was to preclude the witnesses altogether.\n\n      Ulbricht’s arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, Ulbricht\n\nargues that the two experts were necessary to rebut portions of the government’s\n\ncase that he was precluded from addressing during cross-examination, as well as\n\nthe testimony of Ilhwan Yum, a government witness who analyzed transactions\n\n\n\n50\n  We have explained that a Daubert reliability assessment requires a district court\nto consider the “extent to which [the expert’s theory] has been subjected to peer\nreview and publication,” whether the technique is “subject to standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation,” the “known or potential rate of error,”\nand the “degree of acceptance within the relevant scientific community.” United\nStates v. Romano, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That inquiry is a “flexible one,” however, and Daubert is not a\n“definitive checklist or test” for the reliability of expert testimony. Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, “[w]hether Daubert’s specific factors are, or are\nnot, reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case is a matter that the law\ngrants the trial judge broad latitude to determine.” Id. at 331 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n                                          91\n\fassociated with Bitcoin wallets found on Ulbricht’s laptop. Ulbricht now\n\ncontends that portions of Yum’s testimony were incorrect, including his\n\ndescription of what a “hot” Bitcoin wallet is.51 Ulbricht does not, however,\n\nexplain how Yum’s testimony was incorrect, what contrary evidence his experts\n\nwould have provided had they been allowed to testify, or how any purported\n\ncorrection of Yum’s testimony would have affected the case against Ulbricht. Nor\n\nhas he produced any summaries of his proposed expert testimony or described\n\nhow that testimony would have been material to Ulbricht’s guilt or innocence. In\n\nother words, Ulbricht has not shown that precluding Bellovin and Antonopoulos\n\nfrom testifying prejudiced him. Ulbricht’s alternative argument that the\n\ndisclosures were in fact adequate is incorrect for the reasons already explained.\n\n      Ulbricht next argues that preclusion was an unduly harsh remedy under\n\nthe circumstances. Along those lines, he claims that certain exhibits, such as the\n\nsummary chart on which Yum relied, were not produced until mid-trial. Thus,\n\n\n51\n  “The terms hot wallet and cold wallet derive from the more general terms hot\nstorage, meaning online storage, and cold storage, meaning offline storage. A hot\nwallet is a Bitcoin wallet for which the private keys are stored on a network-\nconnected machine (i.e.[,] in hot storage). By contrast, for a cold wallet the private\nkeys are stored offline.” Steven Goldfeder et al., Securing Bitcoin Wallets via a New\nDSA/ECDSA Threshold Signature Scheme, Princeton University 10, available at\nhttp://www.cs.princeton.edu/~stevenag/threshold_sigs.pdf.\n\n                                          92\n\faccording to Ulbricht, he could not have known about his need for expert\n\nwitnesses to counter specific trial exhibits until it was already too late to comply\n\nwith Rule 16. In his view, the district court should not have held him so strictly to\n\nRule 16’s requirements because he could not have known until Yum testified that\n\nhe would need to call an expert.\n\n      While Ulbricht is correct that excluding his experts was a harsh sanction\n\nand was not to be imposed lightly, the district court considered the possibility of\n\ngranting a continuance or a more limited sanction and found those remedies to\n\nbe inappropriate under the circumstances. Such careful consideration of a range\n\nof possible sanctions short of preclusion is especially important in the atypical\n\ncase where a criminal defendant, rather than the government, is precluded from\n\nputting on his case because of a Rule 16 violation. Limiting the defense’s\n\npresentation of his case implicates the fundamental right of “an accused to\n\npresent witnesses in his own defense.” Chambers v. Mississippi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302\n\n(1973). However, the defendant must still “comply with established rules of\n\nprocedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the\n\nascertainment of guilt and innocence.” Id. Here, Ulbricht did not comply with the\n\nprocedural requirements associated with expert disclosures. The district court\n\n\n                                         93\n\fgave the issue due consideration and appropriately exercised its discretion in\n\nremedying the defense’s Rule 16 violation.\n\n      Finally, Ulbricht cannot credibly argue that Yum’s testimony was the first\n\nnotice he had about the possible need for an expert witness to testify as part of\n\nhis affirmative case. The Silk Road prosecution was uniquely laden with issues\n\nrelated to technology, computer servers, forensics, cyber security, digital\n\ncurrency, and myriad other issues that are indisputably “beyond the ken of the\n\naverage juror.” United States v. Mejia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195793\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195793/united-states-v-mejia/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Ulbricht surely knew from the outset that, in order to\n\nmount a meaningful attack on the government’s voluminous and technically\n\ncomplex evidence, he would need to call his own expert. Indeed, in his opening\n\nstatement, Ulbricht’s counsel claimed that he would show that the Bitcoins in\n\nUlbricht’s wallet were from innocent transactions associated with Bitcoin\n\nspeculation, rather than, as the government contended, related to Silk Road.52\n\n\n\n\n52\n  No evidence about the source of those Bitcoins was in fact presented by\nUlbricht, and neither the expert disclosures presented to the district court nor\nUlbricht’s arguments on appeal suggest that either Bellovin or Antonopoulos\nwould have provided an analysis or explanation of Ulbricht’s Bitcoin transactions\nthat would have revealed a non-Silk Road source for Ulbricht’s Bitcoins.\n\n                                          94\n\fUlbricht’s opening statement also implied that BitTorrent’s53 security deficiencies\n\ncould have allowed the true DPR to plant incriminating evidence on his laptop. It\n\nis difficult to fathom how he planned to advance those theories without relying\n\non expert testimony.\n\n      In short, Ulbricht argues that the district court’s preclusion of his proffered\n\nexpert witnesses denied him a fair opportunity to present his defense. But the\n\nsame failings that render Ulbricht’s expert disclosures inadequate under Rule 16\n\npreclude us from finding the kind of prejudice he asserts. Ulbricht did not\n\ndisclose to the district court, and has not presented on appeal, any explanation of\n\nwhat the proposed experts would have said that would have supported a non-\n\nspeculative basis for doubting the probative value of evidence from a variety of\n\nelectronic and other sources identifying Ulbricht as DPR throughout the life of\n\nSilk Road. Thus, we cannot conclude that he was prejudiced by the experts’\n\nexclusion.\n\n\n\n\n53\n BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing service that is used to transfer large files\nwithout disrupting Internet servers.

Curtailing Cross-Examination\n\n      Ulbricht contends that the district court erred in limiting his ability to\n\ncross-examine two government witnesses: Der-Yeghiayan and Kiernan. “We\n\nreview a trial court’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.” United States v.

Thus, “a district court may\n\nimpose reasonable limits on cross-examination to protect against, e.g.,\n\nharassment, prejudice, confusion, and waste.” James, 712 F.3d at 103 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). In general, however, a “district court should afford\n\nwide latitude to a defendant in a criminal case to cross-examine government\n\nwitnesses.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). That is so because the\n\nConfrontation Clause gives “a defendant the right not only to cross-examination,\n\nbut to effective cross-examination.” Id. “[I]t does not follow, of course, that the\n\nConfrontation Clause prevents a trial judge from imposing any limits” on defense\n\ncounsel’s cross-examination of government witnesses.

Agent Der-Yeghiayan\n\n      Ulbricht argues that the district court erred when it struck portions of Der-\n\nYeghiayan’s testimony that referenced his prior belief that Karpeles might be\n\nDread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht also challenges the striking of a similar but\n\nanalytically distinct piece of testimony: Der-Yeghiayan’s statement that\n\nKarpeles’s attorney had offered information about Silk Road in exchange for\n\nKarpeles receiving immunity from prosecution. Ulbricht wanted the jury to infer\n\nthat Karpeles had some criminal involvement in Silk Road that motivated him to\n\npursue a cooperation agreement with the government.\n\n      Der-Yeghiayan answered the defendant’s initial questions about those\n\ntopics, and the government did not object to them until a later side bar. During\n\nthe side bar, the district court expressed its initial view that the questions were\n\nproper, but requested written briefing on the subject. After reviewing the parties’\n\nsubmissions, the district court agreed with the government that neither Der-\n\nYeghiayan’s prior opinions about whether Karpeles was DPR nor Karpeles’s\n\noffer of information about Silk Road was relevant to Ulbricht’s case. The court\n\nthus directed the government to identify portions of Der-Yeghiayan’s testimony\n\n\n\n\n                                          97\n\fto strike. After the government identified the improper testimony, the district\n\ncourt gave a general limiting instruction to the jury:\n\n             You heard testimony while Mr. Der-Yeghiayan was on\n             the stand regarding personal beliefs or suspicions he\n             may have had about particular individuals at various\n             points during his investigation. And I instruct you that\n             what the agent suspected about others isn’t evidence\n             and should be disregarded. Now, consistent with all of\n             the instructions I’m going to give you at the end of the\n             case, there was other testimony that Mr. Der-Yeghiayan\n             provided which you may consider during your\n             deliberations and give it the weight that you deem that\n             it deserves. So it’s the suspicions, all right?\n\nTr. 974. Ulbricht contends on appeal that the district court erred in striking the\n\ntestimony.\n\n      We disagree. The district court did not err in concluding that Der-\n\nYeghiayan’s prior beliefs about Karpeles as a possible DPR suspect were not\n\nrelevant to the charges against Ulbricht. In order to elicit testimony implicating\n\nan alternative perpetrator, a defendant “must show that his proffered evidence\n\non the alleged alternative perpetrator is sufficient, on its own or in combination\n\nwith other evidence in the record, to show a nexus between the crime charged\n\nand the asserted alternative perpetrator.” Wade v.

Thus, striking Der-Yeghiayan’s\n\ntestimony and instructing the jury to disregard his earlier opinions about\n\nKarpeles’s possible guilt was not error.54\n\n      Further, any arguable error that occurred was harmless. Defense counsel\n\ncontinued to cross-examine Der-Yeghiayan and elicited admissible testimony\n\nabout the earlier investigation into Karpeles; indeed, the district court took over\n\ncross-examination at several points to assist the defense in asking proper\n\nquestions. Cf. Cotto v. Herbert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782204\"><a href=\"/opinion/782204/richard-cotto-v-victor-herbert-warden-attica-correctional-facility/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (2d Cir. 2003) (in considering\n\n\n\n54\n  Ulbricht also contends on appeal that the government’s objection to the\ntestimony, which occurred at a later sidebar, was untimely. He cites no law in\nsupport of that argument. In general, an “objection should be made after the\nquestion has been asked but before an answer has been given.” Hutchinson v.\nGroskin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557205\"><a href=\"/opinion/557205/bonnie-j-hutchinson-v-stephen-groskin-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (2d Cir. 1991).

Thus, although a contemporaneous\nobjection is preferable, the district court was within its discretion to sustain the\nlater objection and strike the testimony.\n\n                                          99\n\fwhether a Confrontation Clause violation is harmless, we consider, inter alia, “the\n\nextent of cross-examination otherwise permitted”). Moreover, Ulbricht discussed\n\nthe investigation of Karpeles in his summation without objection. What was\n\nrelevant at trial was any actual evidence pointing to Karpeles as the true Dread\n\nPirate Roberts. The district court did not limit Ulbricht’s cross-examination of\n\nDer-Yeghiayan as to his knowledge of such evidence. The district court directed\n\nthe jury to disregard only testimony as to the agent’s “suspicions,” Tr. 974, a\n\nsubject of “little or no relevance to . . . the defendant[’s] guilt,” Johnson, 529 F.3d\n\nat 501.\n\n      We similarly reject Ulbricht’s contention that striking Der-Yeghiayan’s\n\ntestimony concerning Karpeles’s offer to provide information about Silk Road in\n\nexchange for immunity was an abuse of discretion. Absent other evidence in the\n\nrecord regarding Karpeles, it was proper to exclude wholly speculative\n\nsuggestions of an alternative perpetrator defense based on Karpeles’s attorney’s\n\noffer of information in exchange for his client’s immunity. And even assuming,\n\narguendo, that the district court erred in striking the testimony, any error was\n\nharmless. To the extent this testimony was stricken from the trial record, that\n\nruling occurred outside the presence of the jury. All the jury was told was to\n\n\n                                           100\n\fdisregard testimony about “what the agent suspected about others,” Tr. 974, a\n\ncategory that hardly would be understood by the jury to encompass testimony\n\nabout the actions of Karpeles’s attorney. As explained in detail above, moreover,\n\nthe evidence identifying Ulbricht as Dread Pirate Roberts was overwhelming and\n\nlargely unchallenged. That Karpeles may have had information about Silk Road\n\ndoes not imply that he was DPR, only that he had some knowledge of or\n\ninvolvement with the site. Particularly given that Karpeles likely had some\n\nknowledge about Silk Road simply because of his operation of Mt. Gox, a\n\nprominent Bitcoin exchanger, any marginal probative value in the fact that he\n\nclaimed to have such knowledge, and offered to provide it to the government,\n\ncould not have meaningfully affected the balance of evidence available to the jury\n\nregarding the identity of DPR.\n\n            2. Agent Kiernan\n\n      Defense counsel cross-examined Kiernan extensively, and Ulbricht\n\ncontends on appeal that the district court erred in preventing him from exploring\n\ncertain topics during that cross-examination. Those excluded topics include: the\n\n\n\n\n                                       101\n\fmeaning of various acronyms, the significance of a certain line of PHP code,55\n\nwhether the FBI allowed Kiernan to run BitTorrent on his work computer despite\n\nits lack of security, and whether the Linux kernel56 that Kiernan used on his work\n\ncomputer was the same as the one that Ulbricht installed on his laptop. Ulbricht\n\nexplains that he was attempting to show that Kiernan’s conclusions about\n\nUlbricht’s laptop were inaccurate because they were based on unreliable\n\ninformation.\n\n      The district court sustained objections to those questions because, in its\n\nview, they were outside the scope of Kiernan’s direct testimony. See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n611(b) (“Cross-examination should not go beyond the subject matter of the direct\n\nexamination and matters affecting the witness’s credibility.”); Baker v. Goldman\n\nSachs & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Once any direct examination is\n\nconcluded, cross-examination within the scope of the direct follows.”).\n\n      On appeal, Ulbricht claims that, because Kiernan testified about the\n\noperation of Tor Chat and other forensic computer issues during his direct\n\n\n55\n PHP is a common computer programming language that is used primarily in\nwebsite development.\n56\n  A kernel is an operating system’s core, and it “is an essential part of the Linux\noperating system.” Tr. 1070.\n\n                                        102\n\ftestimony, the precluded questions were within that testimony’s scope and\n\nshould have been allowed. Even assuming that Ulbricht is correct, any error is\n\nharmless. Ulbricht was permitted to question Kiernan about whether Linux was\n\ncustomizable, and Kiernan admitted during cross that he did not know whether\n\nhe used the same version of Tor Chat that Ulbricht had installed on his laptop.\n\nUlbricht’s counsel also asked several questions about the security vulnerabilities\n\nof BitTorrent, conveying to the jury that using BitTorrent might have rendered\n\nUlbricht’s computer susceptible to hacking. Thus, Ulbricht was able to elicit\n\ntestimony supporting his proposed inference that Kiernan’s conclusions based on\n\nthe Tor Chat evidence were flawed. Ulbricht does not explain how he was\n\nprejudiced when the district court prohibited him from asking Kiernan certain\n\nother questions. We therefore identify no reversible error in the district court’s\n\nlimitations on Kiernan’s cross examination.\n\n      D. Andrew Jones Hearsay Statement\n\n      The district court excluded a statement allegedly made by Andrew Jones,\n\nwho was a Silk Road administrator under the username Inigo. Jones cooperated\n\nwith the government and was on the government’s witness list until the middle\n\nof trial, when the government decided not to call him. Defense counsel explored\n\n\n                                         103\n\fthe possibility of calling Jones as a witness, but Jones’s attorney advised Ulbricht\n\nthat Jones would invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify if compelled\n\nto appear. In light of Jones’s unavailability, Ulbricht sought to admit a December\n\n29, 2014 letter from the government to defense counsel that described a statement\n\nthat Jones made during one of his interviews.57 The relevant portion of the\n\ngovernment’s letter is as follows:\n\n             At some point in or about August or September 2013,\n             Jones tried to authenticate that the Silk Road user\n             “Dread Pirate Roberts” whom he was talking to at the\n             time . . . was the same person with whom he had been\n             communicating in the past with this username.\n             Previously, . . . Jones and “Dread Pirate Roberts” had\n             agreed upon a “handshake” to use for authentication, in\n             which Jones would provide a certain prompt and\n             “Dread Pirate Roberts” would provide a certain\n             response. When, during the 2013 chat in question, Jones\n             provided what he believed to be the designated prompt,\n             “Dread Pirate Roberts” was unable to provide the\n             response Jones thought they had agreed on. However,\n             later in the chat, Jones asked “Dread Pirate Roberts” to\n             validate himself by specifying the first job that “Dread\n             Pirate Roberts” assigned to him (running the “DPR\n             Book Club”), which “Dread Pirate Roberts” was able to\n             do.\n\n\n\n\n57\n  The government did not concede that the statement was Brady information, but\ndisclosed it “in an abundance of caution.” App’x 398.\n\n                                        104\n\fApp’x 398. Ulbricht argues that the Jones statement58 supports his theory that\n\nmore than one person acted as Dread Pirate Roberts, because at one point DPR\n\ncould authenticate his identity to Jones, but at another time he could not.\n\n      When it became clear that Jones was unavailable to testify, Ulbricht asked\n\nthe government to stipulate that the Jones statement could be read to the jury.\n\nThe government initially agreed, but then changed its mind and opposed\n\nadmitting the Jones statement. The defense acknowledged that the statement was\n\nhearsay, but claimed that it was admissible under two hearsay exceptions: under\n\nRule 804(b)(3), Fed. R. Evid., as a statement against interest, and under Rule 807’s\n\nresidual exception. The district court ruled that the statement was inadmissible,\n\nspecifically addressing only Rule 804(b)(3). On appeal, Ulbricht continues to\n\nargue that the statement was admissible under either exception. Neither of his\n\ntheories is persuasive.59\n\n\n58\n  What Ulbricht sought to introduce was the government’s letter paraphrasing a\nstatement made by Jones during an interview, not a verbatim transcript of what\nJones had said. We refer to it as the “Jones statement” for the sake of simplicity.\n59\n  We note that the Jones statement is double hearsay, in that the defense sought\nto admit the government’s subsequent characterization of Jones’s interview, and\nboth the government’s letter and Jones’s statement to the agents were out of\ncourt statements offered for their truth. When confronted with “hearsay within\nhearsay, or double hearsay,” courts must determine that “each part of the\n\n                                        105\n\f      A district court’s “ultimate decisions as to the admission or exclusion of\n\nevidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion, and will not be disturbed unless\n\nthey are manifestly erroneous.” Davis, 797 F.3d at 201 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citations omitted). To invoke the 804(b)(3) exception for a statement against\n\ninterest, the proponent of the statement “must show (1) that the declarant is\n\nunavailable as a witness, (2) that the statement is sufficiently reliable to warrant\n\nan inference that a reasonable man in [the declarant’s] position would not have\n\nmade the statement unless he believed it to be true, and (3) that corroborating\n\ncircumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.” United States\n\nv.

The\n\nexception applies “only if the district court determines that a reasonable person\n\nin the declarant’s shoes would perceive the statement as detrimental to his or her\n\nown penal interest.” United States v.

The\n\nkey to this inquiry is whether the statement is sufficiently “self-inculpatory,”\n\n\n\n\ncombined statement[]” is independently admissible. United States v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556652\"><a href=\"/opinion/556652/united-states-v-charles-williams-claddis-arrington-mary-ferguson-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (2d Cir. 1991). Because we conclude that no hearsay exception\napplied to the Jones statement at all, we need not address the double hearsay\nissue.\n\n                                         106\n\fwhich the district court must evaluate on a “case-by-case basis.” United States v.\n\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1292293\"><a href=\"/opinion/1292293/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155 (2d Cir. 2007).\n\n      The district court did not err in concluding that the Jones statement did not\n\nfall within Rule 804(b)(3)’s hearsay exception. There is no dispute that Jones was\n\nunavailable to testify because he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege. The court ruled that the Rule 804(b)(3) exception did not apply because\n\nJones was under a cooperation agreement at the time that he made the relevant\n\nstatement to the government and the chat did not have any particular impact on\n\nJones’s penal interests. On appeal, Ulbricht claims that the extent of Jones’s\n\ncriminal liability was unknown when he made the statement because he could\n\nstill be vulnerable to prosecution in other jurisdictions, and he had not yet been\n\nsentenced when he made the statement to the government. See Mitchell v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118278\"><a href=\"/opinion/118278/mitchell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326 (1999) (in the Fifth Amendment context, there can be a\n\n“legitimate fear of adverse consequences from further testimony” where a\n\nsentence has not yet been imposed).\n\n      We are not persuaded that Jones’s statement was against his penal\n\ninterests. Given the cooperation agreement, the government’s role at Jones’s\n\nfuture sentencing, and the penalties for lying to the government, it is far from\n\n\n                                         107\n\fclear that it was against Jones’s interest to disclose details of his criminal activities\n\nat the time the statement in question was made. Moreover, even to the extent that\n\nJones’s disclosures taken as a whole constituted inculpatory admissions, the\n\nparticular statement in question had little adverse effect on Jones. Jones’s\n\ninculpatory admissions to the government concern whether he committed crimes\n\nconnected to Silk Road. His description of his “handshake” with DPR\n\npresupposes that he had already discussed his own crimes with the government.\n\nWhether DPR did or did not recognize Jones’s identifying prompt does not bear\n\non Jones’s guilt of any crime associated with the site, since he had already\n\nconfirmed his role working for DPR. The details of this conversation with DPR\n\nthus do not inculpate Jones; instead, they either help or hurt Ulbricht.\n\nAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Rule\n\n804(b)(3) does not apply.\n\n      Rule 807 provides for a limited, residual exception to the rule against\n\nhearsay where no other exception applies. A hearsay statement may be\n\nadmissible under Rule 807 if: “(i) it is particularly trustworthy; (ii) it bears on a\n\nmaterial fact; (iii) it is the most probative evidence addressing that fact; (iv) its\n\nadmission is consistent with the rules of evidence and advances the interests of\n\n\n                                          108\n\fjustice; and (v) its proffer follows adequate notice to the adverse party.” United\n\nStates v.

The “residual hearsay exception[] will be used very rarely, and only in\n\nexceptional circumstances.” Parsons v. Honeywell, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558582\"><a href=\"/opinion/558582/32-fed-r-evid-serv-866-prodliabrepcchp-12792-frank-parsons-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 907 (2d Cir.\n\n1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The district court did not specifically address Ulbricht’s request to admit\n\nthe statement under Rule 807, but we conclude that the limited residual exception\n\ndoes not assist Ulbricht. We are loath to assume that a statement made by a\n\ncriminal in debriefings to the government pursuant to a cooperation agreement is\n\ncategorically “particularly trustworthy,” as Rule 807 requires. But even if Jones’s\n\nstatement meets that criterion, and was offered “as evidence of a material fact,”\n\nwe cannot say that it is “more probative on the point for which it is offered than\n\nany other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 807(a)(2)-(3). Ulbricht has not attempted to explain how the Jones\n\nstatement satisfies this requirement.\n\n      Finally, even if the district court erred in excluding the statement under\n\neither hearsay exception, any error was certainly harmless. The conversation\n\nbetween Jones and DPR in its totality was not actually helpful to Ulbricht. As\n\n\n                                        109\n\fexplained, during the chat in question, DPR was at one point unable to provide\n\nthe designated response, but later he identified himself to Jones’s satisfaction.\n\nThe statement thus contains the seeds of its own refutation. Since DPR’s alleged\n\nfailure to verify his identity and his subsequent remedy of that failure occurred\n\nduring the same online chat, the interaction provides little or no support for the\n\ndefense theory that different individuals acted as DPR at different times.\n\n      E. Cumulative Error\n\n      Ulbricht argues that the cumulative effect of the district court’s evidentiary\n\nrulings deprived him of a fair trial. See United States v. Al-Moayad, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2571\"><a href=\"/opinion/2571/united-states-v-al-moayad/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n178 (2d Cir. 2008). We have exhaustively reviewed his contentions of trial error\n\nand have concluded that none of those contentions has merit. The challenged\n\ntrial rulings were well within the district court’s discretion, and the various\n\nexclusions did not prevent the defense from offering evidence probative of\n\ninnocence. At the trial in this case, the government presented overwhelming\n\nevidence that Ulbricht was indeed Dread Pirate Roberts. The evidence that the\n\ndefense was precluded from offering to refute that proof was excluded because it\n\nwas speculative, unreliable, offered in contravention of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence or of Criminal Procedure, or otherwise inadmissible. The few instances\n\n\n                                         110\n\fin which the district court’s rulings may be questioned, where we noted the\n\nrelevance of the harmless error rule, involved minor and marginal points.\n\nAccordingly, whether considered separately or cumulatively, none of Ulbricht’s\n\nevidentiary arguments lead us to doubt that he was found guilty after a fair trial.\n\nIII.   Sentencing\n\n       “[A] district court has broad latitude to impose either a Guidelines\n\nsentence or a non-Guidelines sentence.” Rigas, 583 F.3d at 114 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). “Accordingly, the role of the Court of Appeals is limited to\n\nexamining a sentence for reasonableness, which is akin to review under an\n\n‘abuse-of-discretion’ standard.” Id. “This standard applies both to the\n\n[substantive reasonableness of the] sentence itself and to the procedures\n\nemployed in arriving at the sentence.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nUlbricht and amici60 challenge his life sentence as both procedurally and\n\nsubstantively unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n60\n  The amici who join Ulbricht’s challenge to his life sentence include: the Drug\nPolicy Alliance, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, JustLeadershipUSA, and\nretired District Judge Nancy Gertner.\n\n                                        111\n\f      A. Procedural Reasonableness\n\n      “A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court fails to\n\ncalculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treats the\n\nSentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the § 3553(a) factors, selects\n\na sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the\n\nchosen sentence.” United States v.

In terms of our sentencing jurisprudence, Ulbricht\n\nclaims that the district court relied on clearly erroneous facts in imposing\n\nsentence. We are not persuaded.\n\n      Ulbricht submitted an expert report in which Dr. Mark Taff wrote that the\n\nrecords associated with the six deaths were substantially incomplete. For\n\nexample, many did not include full autopsies, rendering it difficult to discern the\n\nprecise cause of death to a reasonable degree of medical certainty in five of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         113\n\fcases.61 Equally importantly, Dr. Taff wrote that he could not conclusively\n\nconnect the specific drugs that the decedents consumed with Silk Road, because\n\nit is impossible to “correlate the time of purchase/acquisition from an alleged Silk\n\nRoad vendor” and the “time of usage of the alleged Silk road purchase” with the\n\ndeaths.62 S.A. 446. We assume for purposes of this opinion that Dr. Taff’s\n\nconclusions are sufficiently sound to raise a genuine question about whether the\n\ndeaths described in the PSR were caused by drugs purchased on Silk Road. As\n\nexplained above, however, Ulbricht was not being prosecuted or punished for\n\nhomicide on a theory that he personally caused those deaths. Nor did the fact of\n\nthe deaths increase his offense level under the Guidelines. The question before\n\nthe district court was whether the sale of large quantities of drugs on Silk Road\n\n\n61\n  In the sixth case, Dr. Taff concluded that the cause of death was ingesting\nmultiple drugs coupled with a pre-existing heart condition. The original forensic\nreports concerning that death did not factor in the presence of drugs other than\nsynthetic marijuana (obtained via Silk Road) and did not include the heart\ncondition as a contributing cause.\n62\n  Sentencing amici make a similar argument, claiming that a complex array of\ncauses are responsible for drug-related deaths, including societal failures.\nAssuming that is correct, the increased availability of drugs is certainly one of the\ncauses of overdose and other drug-related accidental deaths. Thus, the district\ncourt did not err in concluding that Silk Road, which was by all accounts a\nmarket-expanding drug enterprise, contributed to the general social costs of drug\ntrafficking. Those harms are numerous and include the risk of death.\n\n                                         114\n\fcreated a sufficient risk of death to permit the district court to take the deaths into\n\naccount in assessing the seriousness of Ulbricht’s crimes when it considered the\n\nfactors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n      As with other facts relevant to sentencing, that question is for the district\n\ncourt to answer, based on the preponderance of the evidence. Norman, 776 F.3d at\n\n76. Contrary to Ulbricht’s claims, the district court did not summarily reject Dr.\n\nTaff’s conclusions. Rather, it addressed his report carefully and acknowledged\n\nthe evidentiary challenges of connecting the deaths to Silk Road. The court\n\nconcluded that Dr. Taff’s proposed “reasonable degree of medical certainty”\n\nstandard was simply too high an evidentiary standard for purposes of including\n\nthe deaths in the PSR. The court reasoned that it was “not asking whether the but\n\nfor cause of death is drugs purchased on Silk Road,” but rather “whether there is\n\na connection between the purchase of drugs on Silk Road and [the] death” in the\n\nsense that the sale of those drugs created a risk of death. App’x 1476.\n\n      For those limited purposes and judged by that standard, the circumstantial\n\nevidence connecting the drug-related deaths to Silk Road was sufficient to\n\nconsider them at Ulbricht’s sentencing. To take the strongest example, one\n\ndecedent was found in his apartment with a package torn open. His computer\n\n\n                                         115\n\fhad the Silk Road site open, with chat messages from the vendor describing the\n\nheroin and prescription drug purchase as well as the package tracking\n\ninformation. The tracking number matched the information on the torn package\n\nin the apartment. A toxicology report determined that he died of an overdose of\n\nheroin combined with other prescription drugs. The facts connecting the other\n\nfive deaths to Silk Road varied in strength. The available evidence was sufficient,\n\nhowever, to allow the district court find by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nthe deaths were connected to Silk Road; therefore, the court could consider the\n\nrisk of death that the site created. Nothing in the sentencing transcript suggests\n\nthat the court considered the information for any other purpose.\n\n      We are sensitive to the possibility that the evidence of the six deaths was\n\nemotionally inflammatory and risked implicitly escalating Ulbricht’s\n\nresponsibility from facilitating the sale of drugs to causing the deaths of several\n\ndrug users.63 But there is no indication that the deaths in question played such a\n\nrole in the district court’s sentencing determination. In urging the court to\n\n\n\n63\n  Ulbricht does not argue that the evidence related to the accidental overdose\ndeaths should have been excluded due to its emotional nature; his argument is\nbased solely on the claim that the evidence was irrelevant because the deaths\nwere not sufficiently linked to Silk Road.\n\n                                         116\n\fconsider evidence of the deaths, the government explained that the deaths\n\n“illustrate the obvious: that drugs can cause serious harm, including death.”\n\nApp’x 902.

Pacheco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202771\"><a href=\"/opinion/202771/united-states-v-pacheco/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 n.5 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(observing that a defendant who “engaged in the commercial trade of potent\n\nsubstances . . . must have known [that such trade] could have dire\n\nconsequences”).\n\n      Of course, to the extent that the harms of the drug trade were obvious,\n\nthere was no need to introduce evidence of these particular incidents, let alone to\n\nhammer the point home with unavoidably emotional victim impact statements\n\nby parents of two of the decedents.64 No federal judge needs to be reminded of\n\nthe tragic consequences of the traffic in dangerous substances on the lives of\n\nusers and addicts, or of the risks of overdose and other ramifications of the most\n\ndangerous of illegal drugs. Those consequences are among the reasons why\n\nillegal drugs are prohibited and constitute a principal justification advanced for\n\nthe extremely lengthy sentences provided by federal statutes and sentencing\n\nguidelines for trafficking in illicit substances. Absent reason to believe that a drug\n\n\n64\n  Ulbricht does not challenge the propriety of those statements apart from his\ngeneral argument that it was procedurally unreasonable to consider the six\ndeaths as relevant to his sentence.\n\n                                          117\n\fdealer’s methods were unusually reckless, in that they enhanced the risk of death\n\nfrom drugs he sold beyond those already inherent in the trade, we do not think\n\nthat the fact that the ever-present risk of tragedy came to fruition in a particular\n\ninstance should enhance those sentences, or that the inability of the government\n\nto link a particular dealer’s product to a specific death should mitigate them. The\n\ngovernment’s insistence on proceeding with this evidence generated an appellate\n\nissue that has taken on a disproportionate focus in relation to the reasons actually\n\nadvanced by the district court in its lengthy and careful statement of the reasons\n\nfor the sentence it imposed. App’x 1509-41.\n\n      We are not persuaded, however, that the introduction of the evidence in\n\nthis case was error, although it may have been incautious for the government to\n\ninsist on presenting it to the district court. As already explained, it was certainly\n\nappropriate for the district court to consider the risk of death from use of drugs\n\nin assessing the seriousness of the offense conduct, one of the factors that a judge\n\nmust consider in imposing sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A). That appears\n\nto be the only way the judge in this case used the evidence of the drug-related\n\ndeaths. Emotionally wrenching as the statements of the decedents’ parents were,\n\nwe cannot and do not assume that federal judges are unable to put their\n\n\n                                         118\n\fsympathies for particular victims to one side and assess the evidence for its\n\nrational relationship to the sentencing decision. And here, the record makes clear\n\nthat the district court did not use the evidence of the drug-related deaths to\n\nenhance Ulbricht’s sentence, either as a formal matter under the Guidelines or\n\notherwise. For all the extensive litigation of the propriety of including this\n\ninformation in the PSR, in imposing sentence the district court did not refer to the\n\ndrug-related deaths as an aggravating factor. Indeed, the only mention of that\n\nevidence at all was a passing reference to “facts brought out in connection with\n\n[those] death[s]” that “provide evidence of first-time and expanded [drug]\n\nusage.” App’x 1521-22. This reference occurred in the entirely appropriate\n\ncontext of a lengthy discussion of the general social harms of Ulbricht’s massive\n\ndrug-trading marketplace. Id. at 1522-28.\n\n      That discussion was particularly germane to this case for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Ulbricht claimed that Silk Road reduced the harms associated with the drug\n\ntrade in several ways. For example, he argued that trafficking in drugs over the\n\nInternet reduced violence associated with hand-to-hand transactions and the\n\nsocietal stigma of drug use, and Silk Road’s vendor rating system ensured that\n\ncustomers had access to better quality drugs and more information about the\n\n\n                                         119\n\fdrugs that they were purchasing. Those arguments prompted the district court to\n\nreflect broadly on the costs of the drug trade and discuss Silk Road’s\n\nparticipation in those harms. Reasonable people may and do disagree about the\n\nsocial utility of harsh sentences for the distribution of controlled substances, or\n\neven of criminal prohibition of their sale and use at all. It is very possible that, at\n\nsome future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and\n\nadopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and\n\ncosts of drug use.\n\n      At this point in our history, however, the democratically-elected\n\nrepresentatives of the people have opted for a policy of prohibition, backed by\n\nsevere punishment. That policy results in the routine incarceration of many\n\ntraffickers for extended periods of time. This case involves a defendant who\n\nstood at one remove from the trade, who did not for the most part dirty his\n\nhands with the actual possession and sale of drugs and other contraband that his\n\nsite offered. But he did take a cut of the proceeds, in exchange for making it\n\neasier for such drugs to be purchased and sold, in a way that may well have\n\nexpanded the market by allowing more people access to drugs in greater\n\nquantities than might otherwise have been available to them. In the routine\n\n\n                                          120\n\finstances of sentencing drug sellers, the dangerous aspects of the trade are close\n\nto the surface and require little emphasis. In this case, a reminder of the\n\nconsequences of facilitating such transactions was perhaps more necessary,\n\nparticularly because Ulbricht claimed that his site actually made the drug trade\n\nsafer, and he appeared to contest the legitimacy of the laws he violated.65\n\n\n65\n  In a footnote in his reply brief, Ulbricht raises for the first time an additional\nargument: that the district court improperly gave him a life sentence because of\nthe political and philosophical beliefs that led him to start Silk Road in the first\ninstance. Ulbricht argues that reliance on political beliefs at sentencing is\nprohibited by the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10, and the First Amendment. The\ndistrict court reflected on Ulbricht’s philosophy, however, only in the course of\ndiscussing his character and his reasons for committing the offense. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(a)(1). That discussion was relevant to sentencing. Ulbricht, as the district\ncourt concluded,“viewed Silk Road both as above the law and the laws didn’t\napply.” App’x 1515. He appeared to believe that his personal views about the\npropriety of the drug laws and the paramount role of individual liberty entitled\nhim to violate democratically-enacted criminal prohibitions. For example, some\nof his Silk Road posts “discuss the laws as the oppressor” and proclaim that\n“each transaction is a victory over the oppressor.” Id. at 1516. That Ulbricht\nbelieves that drug use should be legalized is not relevant to sentencing; that he\nbelieves he is entitled to break the laws that prohibit certain substances is\nrelevant to his likelihood of recidivism, a mandated sentencing consideration. 18\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(C). The district court therefore did not sentence Ulbricht based\non any prohibited characteristic, nor did the court place more weight on that\nfactor than the facts warranted. Cf. United States v. Jenkins, —F.3d.—, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1371399</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. Apr. 17, 2017) (vacating a sentence as substantively\nunreasonable where the district court relied exclusively on the defendant’s\n“disdain for the law” in “dramatically increasing” a defendant’s sentence for\nchild pornography offenses). Ulbricht’s disrespect for the law was simply one\nfactor that the district court considered in imposing sentence, along with many\n\n                                         121\n\f      Finally, we need look no further than the district court’s express reasons\n\nfor imposing sentence to conclude that drug-related deaths played little part in\n\ndictating the sentence imposed. As tragic as they are, and as foreseeable in light\n\nof the volume of dangerous drugs trafficked through Silk Road, those deaths\n\nwere accidents. In light of the overwhelming evidence, discussed below, that\n\nUlbricht was prepared, like other drug kingpins, to protect his profits by paying\n\nlarge sums of money to have individuals who threatened his enterprise\n\nmurdered, it would be plainly wrong to conclude that he was sentenced for\n\naccidental deaths that the district court discussed only in passing in imposing\n\nsentence. Even were we to conclude that the evidence of the Silk Road-related\n\ndeaths should not have been received, any error would be harmless, because the\n\nrecord is absolutely clear that the district court, after finding that Ulbricht\n\ncommissioned five murders, would have imposed the same sentence if the\n\nevidence of the drug-related deaths had been excluded.\n\n      The sentencing amici advance one additional argument: that the district\n\ncourt’s consideration of the drug-related deaths violated the Fifth and Sixth\n\nAmendments because the fact of those deaths was not charged in the Indictment\n\n\nothers, and was not accorded undue weight in determining the sentence.\n\n                                          122\n\fand proven to the jury. “While we are not required to address arguments raised\n\nonly by an amicus,” Am.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n2163 (2013). Here, the six drug-related deaths (and more importantly, Ulbricht’s\n\nattempted murders for hire) were uncharged facts that did not increase either the\n\nstatutory twenty-year minimum or the maximum life sentence applicable to the\n\ncrimes of which he was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, by the jury.\n\nThus, the district court did not violate the Constitution when it found by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the six deaths were connected to Silk Road\n\n\n                                         123\n\fand that they were relevant to Ulbricht’s sentence because they were part of the\n\nharm that the site caused.\n\n      In sum, we might not, in the prosecutors’ shoes, have chosen to offer this\n\nevidence at sentencing, or have admitted it as district judges. We conclude,\n\nhowever, (1) that the district court did not clearly err when it found by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the six deaths were connected to Silk Road;\n\n(2) that it did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was appropriate to\n\nconsider those acts as bearing on the seriousness of the narcotics offenses of\n\nwhich Ulbricht was convicted, one of many factors the district court was required\n\nto consider in exercising its discretion under § 3553(a); and (3) that the evidence\n\nin question in fact played a minimal role, if any, in the actual sentencing, and that\n\nin light of the reasons given by the district court for its sentencing decision, we\n\ncan be absolutely certain that the same sentence would have been imposed if the\n\nevidence had not been received.

The district court identified\n\nnumerous facts that made Ulbricht’s case extraordinary, in its view rendering a\n\nlife sentence “sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the\n\npurposes” of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The court described the crime as a\n\n“planned, comprehensive, and deliberate scheme . . . which posed serious danger\n\nto public health and to our communities.” App’x 1511-12. Silk Road was a\n\n\n                                           125\n\f“worldwide criminal drug enterprise with a massive geographic scope.” Id. at\n\n1512. The fact that Ulbricht operated the site from behind a computer, rather than\n\nin person like a more prototypical drug kingpin, does not make his crime less\n\nserious or less dangerous. Moreover, Silk Road uniquely expanded the drug\n\nmarket by providing an easy avenue for people to become first-time drug users\n\nand dealers. Because drugs were shipped to customers in the mail, Silk Road\n\nbrought “drugs to communities that previously may have had no access to such\n\ndrugs . . . in such quantities.” Id. at 1522.\n\n       The quantity and nature of the drugs sold on Silk Road are staggering.\n\nAccording to the PSR, from 2011 through 2013, Silk Road customers transacted in\n\napproximately $183 million worth of illegal drugs. At the time the government\n\nshut down Silk Road on October 2, 2013, there were approximately 13,802 listings\n\nfor controlled substances on the website. Of those listings, there were 643 listings\n\nfor cocaine-based products, 305 for LSD products, and 261 for methamphetamine\n\nproducts. The drugs were sold mostly for individual, personal use, but some\n\ndrugs such as heroin and cocaine were also available in “multi-kilogram\n\nquantities.” PSR ¶ 26. The available drugs were not limited to heroin, narcotics,\n\nsynthetic marijuana, and other dangerous but recreational substances. For\n\n\n                                           126\n\fexample, after being told that cyanide was “the most well known assassination\n\nsuicide [sic] poison out there,” Ulbricht allowed vendors to sell it on Silk Road\n\ndespite its singular, deadly purpose. App’x 1519. As the district court noted,\n\ndespite earlier protestations that Silk Road would not allow the sale of products\n\nthat could be used to inflict deliberate harm on others, it took Ulbricht all of six\n\nminutes to decide “that it is okay to sell cyanide,” id., in exchange for the\n\ncustomary cut of the proceeds.\n\n      The drug offenses alone—ignoring all other illicit materials sold on the\n\nsite66—yielded a calculated offense level of 50. Of that calculation, only two levels\n\n\n66\n  As explained, Silk Road also trafficked in illegal goods such as counterfeit\nidentification documents and computer hacking tools and services. When the\ngovernment shut down Silk Road, there were 156 listings for forged identity\ndocuments on the site. The specific computer hacking tools available included\nsoftware for compromising usernames and passwords of electronic accounts,\nincluding email and Facebook; Remote Access Tools (“RATs”) that allow hackers\nto obtain remote access to a victim’s computer, including turning on and using\nthe computer’s webcam; keyloggers, which allow a user to monitor keystrokes\ninputted by a victim to discern their passwords and other sensitive information;\nand Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) tools, which allow hackers to disable\nwebsites by flooding networks with malicious Internet traffic. Silk Road also\noffered money laundering services through vendors who sold U.S. currency and\nanonymous debit cards. Because the adjusted offense levels for those groups of\noffenses were substantially lower than the offense level for the drug group, they\ndid not contribute to Ulbricht’s overall offense level. In assessing the substantive\nreasonableness of the sentence imposed, however, it is well to remember that the\nsentence encompassed Ulbricht’s role not only in the distribution of controlled\n\n                                         127\n\fare attributable to Ulbricht’s “credible threats of directed violence” associated\n\nwith the murders for hire. PSR ¶ 94. Thus, even without considering that\n\nenhancement, the drug convictions yielded an offense level of 48, which is higher\n\nthan the maximum offense level recognized by the Guidelines, for which a\n\nsentence of life imprisonment is recommended even for someone who, like\n\nUlbricht, has no prior criminal convictions. Ulbricht does not challenge the\n\naccuracy of the Guidelines calculation or of the fact-findings on which it is based.\n\n      That the sentence imposed accorded with the Guidelines recommendation\n\ndoes not automatically render it reasonable.

The Guidelines are, however, themselves a factor that\n\nCongress has directed district courts to consider. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4)(A).\n\nMoreover, as the considered judgment of the United States Sentencing\n\nCommission, they bear on the other factors that Congress has required courts to\n\nevaluate, including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, id.\n\n§ 3553(a)(2)(A), to provide adequate deterrence, id. § 3553(a)(2)(B), and, because\n\nthey are considered by all judges throughout the federal system, the need to\n\n\n\n\nsubstances, but in a wide variety of other criminal offenses as well.\n\n\n                                         128\n\f“avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records\n\nwho have been found guilty of similar conduct,” id. § 3553(a)(6).\n\n      Accordingly, while a life sentence for selling drugs alone would give\n\npause, we would be hard put to find such a sentence beyond the bounds of\n\nreason for drug crimes of this magnitude.67 But the facts of this case involve much\n\nmore than simply facilitating the sale of narcotics. The district court found by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Ulbricht commissioned at least five murders\n\nin the course of protecting Silk Road’s anonymity, a finding that Ulbricht does\n\nnot challenge in this appeal.68 Ulbricht discussed those anticipated murders\n\ncallously and casually in his journal and in his communications with the\n\n\n67\n  Note that such a sentence is mandatory under federal law for selling just five\nkilograms of cocaine after two prior convictions for any felony narcotics offense,\nsee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), and the Supreme Court has upheld against\nconstitutional challenge a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for selling\n650 grams of cocaine, Harmelin v. Michigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991).\n68\n  Ulbricht does not mention his orders for the commission of those murders until\nhis reply brief. Even there, he does not argue that the district court erred in\nconcluding that he deliberately commissioned those murders; rather, he claims\ninstead only that the murders did not support a life sentence because they did\nnot actually take place. But in evaluating Ulbricht’s character and dangerousness,\nthe most relevant points are that he wanted the murders to be committed, he\npaid for them, and he believed that they had been carried out. The fact that his\nhired assassin may have defrauded him does not reflect positively on Ulbricht’s\ncharacter. Commissioning the murders significantly justified the life sentence.\n\n                                        129\n\fpurported assassin Redandwhite. For example, in connection with the first hit, he\n\nwrote to Redandwhite that “FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn’t mind if\n\nhe was executed.” Tr. 1822. In the course of negotiating the price for the killing,\n\nDPR claimed that “[n]ot long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k,” id. at 1883, but\n\nthat he had “only ever commissioned the one other hit, so I’m still learning this\n\nmarket,” id. at 1884. He then paid $150,000 in Bitcoins for the murder, and he\n\nreceived what purported to be photographic documentation if its completion.\n\nUlbricht then wrote in his journal that he “[g]ot word that the blackmailer was\n\nexecuted,” id. at 1887, before returning quickly to other tasks associated with\n\nrunning the site.\n\n      In negotiating the other four killings, Ulbricht initially resisted multiple\n\nmurders. He instructed Redandwhite to “just hit Andrew [usernames Tony76\n\nand nipplesuckcanuck] and leave it at that.” Id. at 1897. Redandwhite said he\n\ncould do it for “150 just like last time,” but that he would not be able to recover\n\nany of DPR’s money if he killed only one person because he would have to\n\ncommit the murder outside of the victim’s home or office where he stored his\n\nfunds. Id. If Ulbricht wanted him to recover money, the self-professed assassin\n\nclaimed, he would have to kill not only Tony76, but also his three associates. DPR\n\n\n                                         130\n\fresponded that he would “defer to [Redandwhite’s] better judgment and hope[d]\n\n[to] recover some assets” from the hit. Id. at 1899. He then sent $500,000 in\n\nBitcoins, the agreed-upon price for four killings, to Redandwhite. As the district\n\ncourt stated in discussing Ulbricht’s journal entries concerning these projected\n\nmurders, his words are “the words of a man who is callous as to the\n\nconsequences or the harm and suffering that [his actions] may cause others.”\n\nApp’x 1521.\n\n      The record was more than sufficient to support the district court’s reliance\n\non those attempted murders in sentencing Ulbricht to life in prison. The\n\nattempted murders for hire separate this case from that of an ordinary drug\n\ndealer, regardless of the quantity of drugs involved in the offense, and lend\n\nfurther support to the district court’s finding that Ulbricht’s conduct and\n\ncharacter were exceptionally destructive. That he was able to distance himself\n\nfrom the actual violence he paid for by using a computer to order the killings is\n\nnot mitigating. Indeed, the cruelty that he displayed in his casual and confident\n\nnegotiations for the hits is unnerving. We thus cannot say that a life sentence was\n\noutside the “range of permissible decisions” under the circumstances. Cavera, 550\n\nF.3d at 189.\n\n\n                                        131\n\f      Ulbricht’s arguments on appeal have rhetorical power because of the sheer\n\nmagnitude of his sentence, but they do not provide a legal basis for vacating that\n\nsentence as substantively unreasonable. He contends that the district court\n\nignored the letters submitted on his behalf, thus failing to consider his positive\n\ncontributions to his family and society as well as his potential productivity\n\nshould he be released from prison. To the contrary, however, the district court\n\n“read each and every one of [the letters] with care,” some “more than once.”\n\nApp’x 1534. Recognizing that the letters were “beautiful” and “profoundly\n\nmoving,” the district court observed that they reveal Ulbricht’s human\n\ncomplexity. Id. at 1534-35. Nothing in the record supports the claim that the\n\ndistrict court failed to recognize the importance of the letters, incorrectly\n\ndiscounted Ulbricht’s more favorable characteristics, or otherwise\n\ninappropriately dismissed their role in its sentencing determination.\n\n      Similarly, Ulbricht’s argument that the district court ignored his contention\n\nthat Silk Road reduced the harmful effects of drug crimes must be rejected. The\n\ndistrict court thoroughly discussed Doctor X’s role at Silk Road and Ulbricht’s\n\nclaims that the site reduced violence, overdoses, and other harms associated with\n\ndrug trafficking, and concluded that they were unpersuasive. We see no error in\n\n\n                                         132\n\fits analysis, and Ulbricht’s arguments concerning harm reduction do not render\n\nhis sentence substantively unreasonable.\n\n      Ulbricht also claims that there is an unwarranted disparity between his\n\nsentence and the approximately 17-month sentence that Peter Nash, a Silk Road\n\nadministrator, received. Again, however, the district court considered the\n\narguments concerning Nash’s sentence and found them to be irrelevant to\n\nUlbricht’s crime because Nash was a low-level site administrator who pleaded\n\nguilty and cooperated with the government. Along those same lines, Ulbricht\n\nnotes that Silk Road drug dealers received lower sentences than he did. For\n\nexample, one such drug dealer received a ten-year sentence. The fact that\n\ndifferent people involved with the site received dramatically lower sentences\n\ndoes not mean that Ulbricht’s own sentence was substantively unreasonable on\n\nthe individual facts of his case.69 Ulbricht was the creator and head administrator\n\nof the site. That fact alone distinguishes his case from that of any individual seller\n\nor employee who used or worked for the site. Ulbricht profited from every sale\n\n\n\n69\n  In his reply, Ulbricht references other instances in which people involved with\nSilk Road (and its apparent reincarnation, Silk Road 2.0) received significantly\nlower sentences. Ulbricht does not provide sufficient detail about those\nindividuals’ conduct, however, to permit meaningful comparisons with his case.\n\n                                         133\n\fon Silk Road, and he facilitated the acts of each drug dealer and drug\n\norganization that used it. Moreover, he attempted to commission at least five\n\nmurders to protect his criminal enterprise. Those facts render his case\n\ndistinguishable from those who committed other crimes using Silk Road or\n\notherwise facilitated its operation.\n\n      Ulbricht next reiterates his argument that he was more like someone\n\nrunning a crack house than like a drug kingpin because he created the online\n\nplatform that others used to sell drugs and was not himself a drug dealer.70 That\n\nargument also understates the vast extent of Silk Road’s drug market, which had\n\nthousands of customers and trafficked in about $183 million in illegal drugs.\n\nPeople may differ about whether “respectable” people who, acting as property\n\nowners, money launderers, or other facilitators of crime for personal gain are less\n\nguilty than those who personally handle the narcotics. We cannot fault the\n\ndistrict court for rejecting the argument that Ulbricht’s contribution to the\n\nnarcotics trade was inherently less culpable than that of the dealers who paid him\n\nto use Silk Road to complete their transactions.\n\n\n\n70\n  Ulbricht did sell drugs on Silk Road for at least some brief period of time, when\nhe grew and sold hallucinogenic mushrooms to drum up interest in the site.\n\n                                         134\n\f      Both the sentencing amici and Ulbricht further contend that the district\n\ncourt placed too much weight on the notion of general deterrence in meting out\n\nthe life sentence. Specifically, Ulbricht fears that resorting to “general deterrence\n\nwithout any confining principles . . . guarantees that [the sentence] will create\n\ndisparity.” Appellant Br. 139. Amici also observe that academic studies counsel\n\nagainst placing too much emphasis on general deterrence in sentencing because\n\nsevere criminal punishments do not actually decrease either supply or demand\n\nfor illegal drugs. Further, according to amici, the threat of a long sentence does\n\nnot deter criminal conduct more effectively than the threat of a shorter sentence.\n\nIn his reply, Ulbricht identifies several lucrative dark markets that have emerged\n\nsince Silk Road’s demise in 2013. In his view, the existence of multiple copycat\n\nTor-based illegal marketplaces proves that general deterrence is illusory and that\n\nthe district court placed too much weight on that factor.\n\n      Although those arguments have some support among scholars and\n\nresearchers, the ability of a sentence to “afford adequate deterrence to criminal\n\nconduct” is a factor that district courts are required by Congress to consider in\n\narriving at the appropriate sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B); see United States v.\n\nTran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1193844\"><a href=\"/opinion/1193844/united-states-v-tran/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107 (2d Cir. 2008). Congress, moreover, has not concluded that\n\n\n                                         135\n\fthe persistence of narcotics crimes is a reason to abandon the efforts to deter\n\nthem by lengthy sentences. The district court observed that “general deterrence\n\nplays a particularly important role” in Ulbricht’s case because Silk Road is\n\n“without serious precedent” and generated an unusually large amount of public\n\ninterest. App’x 1532-33. The court thus carefully analyzed the role that general\n\ndeterrence played in Ulbricht’s individual case. At the same time, it is evident\n\nfrom the sentencing transcript that general deterrence was “just one element in\n\nthe [district court’s] analysis,” id. at 1533, and the district court considered many\n\nother factors before sentencing Ulbricht to life in prison. Thus, the factor of\n\ngeneral deterrence, “as explained by the district court, can bear the weight\n\nassigned it under the totality of circumstances in this case.” Rigas, 583 F.3d at 122.\n\n      Finally, Ulbricht and amici point out that life sentences are rare in the\n\nfederal system, typically reserved for egregious violent crimes, thus rendering\n\nUlbricht’s sentence substantively unreasonable.71 Moreover, according to amici,\n\nlife sentences are normally imposed in cases where that is the district judge’s\n\nonly sentencing option. Thus, they claim that Ulbricht’s life sentence is\n\n\n71\n  Amici also claim that Ulbricht’s life sentence violates the Eighth Amendment’s\nban on cruel and unusual punishment. That argument is plainly incorrect in light\nof binding Supreme Court precedent to the contrary. See Harmelin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                         136\n\fsubstantively unreasonable in the context of the federal system, where life\n\nsentences are particularly rare for those with no criminal history who are\n\nconvicted of drug crimes.72\n\n      We agree with Ulbricht that life sentences are extraordinary and\n\ninfrequent, which is as it should be. But the rarity of life sentences does not mean\n\nthat the imposition of such a sentence in this case is substantively unreasonable\n\nunder our law. Each case must be considered on its own facts and in light of all of\n\nthe circumstances of a particular offense as well as other relevant conduct, which,\n\nin this case, includes five attempted murders for hire. As we have described, the\n\ndistrict court carefully considered Ulbricht’s offense, his personal characteristics,\n\nand the context for his crimes, recognizing that only exceptional cases justify\n\nsuch a severe sentence. Although we might not have imposed the same sentence\n\n\n\n72\n  In his reply, Ulbricht raises a distinct but related argument for the first time. He\nargues that “concurrences from Supreme Court opinions and dissents from\ndenials of certiorari suggest[] that judicial factfinding violates a defendant’s\nconstitutional right to a jury trial where the factfinding renders reasonable an\notherwise substantively unreasonable sentence.” Reply Br. 60. For that\nproposition, he cites United States v. Hebert, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563 (5th Cir. 2015), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

His argument, however, has no support in\nexisting law.\n\n                                         137\n\fourselves in the first instance, on the facts of this case a life sentence was “within\n\nthe range of permissible decisions” that the district court could have reached.\n\nRigas, 583 F.3d at 122.\n\n      We do not reach our conclusion lightly.73 A life sentence is the second most\n\nsevere penalty that may be imposed in the federal criminal justice system. “The\n\nsize of [Ulbricht’s] sentence alone [therefore] counsels our careful, searching\n\nreview of it.” United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (2d Cir. 2016) (Sack., J.,\n\nconcurring). Courts have the power to condemn a young man to die in prison,\n\nand judges must exercise that power only in a small number of cases after the\n\ndeepest thought and reflection. Of course, any “sentencing proceeding is a\n\nsolemn occasion at which the judge has the weighty duty of determining the fate\n\n\n\n73\n  The life sentence is particularly severe because, as in all federal cases, Ulbricht\nwill never be eligible for parole. Unlike state sentences in jurisdictions permitting\na sentence of, for example, “25 years to life,” there is no automatic\nreconsideration of this sentence, or of whether an offender has reformed, after\nany lengthy period of incarceration. We note that, particularly in the case of a\nyoung offender, the prisoner will all but certainly change (for better or worse)\nafter many years of incarceration. In a system without parole, however, a\nsentencing court is forced to exercise its best judgment to predict whether a\nsentence of life imprisonment or one of 25, 30, or 50 years is required to serve the\npurposes of sentencing, without the option of deferring that judgment to a point\nat which the effects of incarceration, and the passage of time, will be more\napparent.\n\n                                          138\n\fof another human being.” United States v.

We must be especially sensitive to that duty where the most severe\n\nsentences are in question. The district court gave Ulbricht’s sentence the\n\nthorough consideration that it required, reviewing the voluminous sentencing\n\nsubmissions, analyzing the factors required by law, and carefully weighing\n\nUlbricht’s mitigating arguments. The extraordinarily detailed sentencing\n\ntranscript shows that the district court appreciated its important responsibility in\n\nconsidering a sentence of such magnitude and carried out that responsibility with\n\ncare and prudence. Under the law, we cannot say that its decision was\n\nsubstantively unreasonable.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in\n\nall respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                        139\n\f</pre>",
