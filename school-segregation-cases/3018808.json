The Petition alleged\n\nthat the Blue Springs R-IV School District, the Blue Springs School District Board of\n\nEducation, the superintendent of Blue Springs R-IV School District, and the assistant\n\nsuperintendent of Blue Springs R-IV School District, (collectively \"Respondents\"), had\n\nrefused to allow R.M.A., a transgender male, access to the boys restrooms and locker\n\nrooms. The Petition asserted that, pursuant to federal1 and Missouri law,2 R.M.A. has a\n\nright to access the boys restroom and locker rooms and that the Respondents have a clear\n\nand unconditional legal duty to provide R.M.A. with that access. The Petition requested\n\na writ of mandamus \"commanding Respondents to grant [R.M.A.] and all other\n\ntransgendered students of the Blue Springs R-IV School District full and equal access to\n\nthe appropriate restroom, locker room, and any other facilities segregated by sex as is\n\nconsistent with their gender identity.\"\n\n         The trial court did not initially deny the Petition. Nor did the trial court grant a\n\npreliminary order in mandamus. Rather, without being summoned or otherwise ordered\n\nby the court to do so, the Respondents filed an answer to the Petition on August 22, 2014,\n\nasking that the request for a writ of mandamus be denied and that the Petition be\n\ndismissed with prejudice.\n\n\n\n         1\n           In particular, the Petition cited the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX of\nthe Educational Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. sections 1681-1688.\n         2\n           In particular, the Petition cited to the Missouri Constitution article 1, section 2, and section 213.065. All\nstatutory references are to RSMo 2000 as supplemented unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                                            2\n\f         The trial court conducted a case management conference on November 5, 2014,\n\nand imposed a briefing schedule. In January 2015, the parties submitted stipulated facts\n\nto the trial court and filed briefs in support of their respective positions on the issues\n\nraised by the Petition.\n\n         The trial court held a hearing on February 11, 2015, to permit the parties to orally\n\nargue their positions based on the stipulated facts. At the conclusion of the hearing, the\n\ntrial court stated, \"I'm going to decide this based upon these arguments here, the briefs\n\nI've received, and my view of the law.\"\n\n         The trial court issued its judgment (\"Judgment\") on March 5, 2015, denying the\n\nPetition. The Judgment concluded that R.M.A. has \"no existing, clear, unconditional\n\nlegal right which allows . . . R.M.A. to access restrooms or locker rooms consistent with\n\nR.M.A.'s gender identity.\" The Judgment further concluded that a writ of mandamus was\n\ninappropriate because administrative remedies remained available to R.M.A.3\n\n         R.M.A., through his next friend, appeals.\n\n                                     Authority to Entertain Appeal\n\n         \"In every case before considering claims raised on appeal, this Court has a duty to\n\nsua sponte determine whether we have authority to decide the appeal.\" Collector of\n\nRevenue of City of St. Louis v. Parcels of Land Encumbered with Delinquent Tax Liens,\n\n350 S.W.3d 840, 841 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011). That includes the obligation \"to determine,\n\n\n         3\n         The Petition was filed even though R.M.A. was pursuing traditional administrative remedies to remediate\ndiscrimination. During the hearing on the Petition, R.M.A.'s attorney stated that her client had \"a pending charge of\ndiscrimination with the Missouri Human Rights or the Missouri Commission of Human Rights.\" During oral\nargument before this court, R.M.A. confirmed that a civil action pursuing relief under the Missouri Human Rights\nAct has been filed.\n\n                                                          3\n\fsua sponte, whether the circuit court entered a final appealable judgment.\" Banks v. Slay,\n\n410 S.W.3d 767, 768 (Mo. App. E.D. 2013).\n\n       \"Writs are extraordinary remedies, and their procedures differ from normal civil\n\nactions.\" U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs v. Boresi, 396 S.W.3d 356, 359 n.1 (Mo. banc\n\n2013). Ordinarily, when a writ petition is denied, the appropriate recourse is to file the\n\ndenied writ petition in a higher court. Id. at 358 (citing Rules 84.22 to 84.26 and 94.01 et\n\nseq.). However, in limited circumstances, an appeal may be taken from the denial of a\n\nwrit petition. Id. Boresi, which reflects the Supreme Court's most recent discussion of\n\nthis topic, recognizes two such circumstances. First, \"[a]n appeal will lie from the denial\n\nof a writ petition when a lower court has issued a preliminary order in mandamus but\n\nthen denies a permanent writ.\" Id. (emphasis added) (citing State ex rel. Ashby Road\n\nPartners, LLC v. State Tax Comm'n, 297 S.W.3d 80, 83 (Mo. banc 2009) (addressing\n\nwrits of prohibition pursuant to Rule 97)). Second, \"when the lower court issues a\n\nsummons, the functional equivalent of a preliminary order, and then denies a permanent\n\nwrit, appellate review is available.\" Id. at 359 (citing Ashby Rd. Partners, LLC, 297\n\nS.W.3d at 84).\n\n       Here, neither trigger permitting appellate review is present. After the Petition was\n\nfiled, the trial court did not grant a preliminary order in mandamus. Nor did the trial\n\ncourt issue a summons, the functional equivalent of a preliminary order in mandamus.\n\nRather, the parties and the trial court proceeded as if the Petition initiated an ordinary\n\ncivil action, seemingly oblivious to the requirements of Rule 94. And R.M.A. now seeks\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fappellate review of the Judgment's denial of the Petition on the merits, without regard to\n\nBoresi.\n\n       R.M.A.'s confusion over whether the Judgment is a final, appealable judgment\n\nmay be fueled by pre-Boresi precedent which suggests that the controlling factor in\n\ndetermining the right to appeal is whether a writ has been denied on the merits. See, e.g.,\n\nStone v. Mo. Dep't of Corr., Prob. & Parole Bd., 313 S.W.3d 158, 160 (Mo. App. W.D.\n\n2010) (holding that \"when the circuit court denies a petition for writ of mandamus\n\nfollowing an answer or motion directed to the merits of the controversy and, in doing so,\n\ndetermines a question of fact or law, we treat the court's ruling as final and appealable\").\n\nGiven Stone and other similar cases, it is perhaps understandable that parties and trial\n\ncourts have focused on posturing mandamus proceedings for disposition on the merits,\n\nplacing no utility on abiding by the procedures described in Rule 94.\n\n       In announcing when an appeal will be permitted following denial of a permanent\n\nwrit, Boresi did not address Stone or other similar cases which hold that an appeal will lie\n\nfrom a trial court's denial of a writ petition on the merits. However, it is difficult to read\n\nBoresi as endorsing continued reliance on this legal principle in cases where Rule 94 has\n\nnot been followed.4\n\n       As noted, Boresi held an appeal \"will lie\" from the denial of a permanent writ by a\n\nlower court after issuance of a preliminary writ. 396 S.W.3d at 358. And Boresi held an\n\nappeal \"is available\" when a permanent writ is denied by a lower court after \"the lower\n\ncourt issues a summons, the functional equivalent of a preliminary order.\" Id. at 359.\n\n       4\n           See footnote 7 infra.\n\n                                              5\n\fThe phrase \"is available\" is markedly different from the phrase \"will lie,\" implying that\n\nthere is no appeal as a matter of right unless a preliminary writ has been issued before a\n\npermanent writ is denied, and implying that an appeal is only available as a matter of\n\ndiscretion where a trial court issues a summons that can be viewed as the \"functional\n\nequivalent\" of a preliminary writ. This supposition is confirmed by a footnote in Boresi:\n\n         [T]he . . . practice of issuing a summons in lieu of a preliminary writ is not\n         authorized by Rule 94.5 Writs are extraordinary remedies, and their\n         procedures differ from normal civil actions. The practice of issuing a\n         summons rather that a preliminary order fails to acknowledge the nature of\n         the remedy. Additionally, it requires a response from the respondent\n         without regard to the merits of the petition. Nevertheless, this Court is\n         exercising its discretion to consider the matter on the merits and issue the\n         writ because the parties, who already have litigated the matter fully, were\n         not at fault and should not be required to initiate a new writ proceeding due\n         to the circuit court's failure to follow the procedure proscribed by the rules.\n         This Court is not required to exercise its discretion in like manner in the\n         future.\n\n396 S.W.3d at 356 n.1. Plainly, Boresi holds that trial courts and parties are not free to\n\ndisregard the plain language of Rule 94. Plainly, Boresi holds that the ability to seek\n\nappellate review from the denial of a permanent writ (as opposed to the right to file a\n\ndenied writ in a higher court) is tied to compliance with the provisions of Rule 94.6 In\n\n\n         5\n            The Supreme Court similarly held in Ashby Road Partners, LLC that \"[t]he issuance of a summons is not\nauthorized or anticipated by Rule 97\" in lieu of issuance of a preliminary writ in a prohibition proceeding. 297\nS.W.3d at 84.\n          6\n            This is in keeping with the fact that the procedures for writs (which seek extraordinary remedies) differ\nfrom the procedures in civil proceedings. Boresi, 396 S.W.3d at 359 n.1. Rule 94 provides that \"[p]roceedings in\nmandamus in a circuit court shall be as prescribed in this Rule 94.\" Rule 94.01. To seek a writ of mandamus from a\ncircuit court, a relator must file a petition in mandamus containing \"a statement of the facts, the relief sought, and a\nstatement of the reasons why the writ should issue,\" \"accompanied by suggestions in support thereof.\" Rule 94.03.\nThe petition must also be accompanied by all documents \"essential to an understanding of the matters set forth in the\npetition.\" Id. These pleading requirements are designed to afford the trial court with the information necessary to\nassess the preliminary merits of an extraordinary writ request.\n          Rule 94.04 provides that \"[i]f the court is of the opinion that the preliminary order in mandamus should be\ngranted, such order shall be issued.\" If a preliminary order is issued, Rule 94.05 provides that \"[t]he preliminary\norder shall order the respondent to file an answer within the time fixed by the order,\" and \"[t]he clerk shall . . .\n\n                                                           6\n\flight of Boresi, we cannot discern a reasoned path that would permit this court to\n\nconclude that an appeal will lie as a matter of right merely and solely because a\n\npermanent writ is denied by a lower court on the merits. Instead, we conclude, as is\n\nalready stated in Boresi, that an appeal will lie as a matter of right only where a\n\npermanent writ of mandamus is denied by a lower court on the merits after that court has\n\nissued a preliminary writ.7 396 S.W.3d at 358. And if Rule 94 is not followed, then there\n\nis no right of appeal from the denial of a permanent writ of mandamus (even if on the\n\nmerits), with the narrow proviso that an appeal may be permitted as a matter of discretion\n\nwhere a permanent writ of mandamus is denied on the merits after a trial court has issued\n\na summons that can be fairly characterized as the \"functional equivalent\" of a preliminary\n\nwrit.8 Id. at 359.\n\n         Here, there was no summons issued by the trial court nor any grant of a\n\npreliminary order in mandamus. Rather, the parties and the trial court appear simply to\n\n\n\ndeliver a copy of the preliminary order, together with a copy of the petition, for service . . . . [which] may be made\nas provided in Rule 54.\" Rule 94.07 requires that \"[t]he answer [ordered by Rule 94.05] shall be directed to the\npetition in mandamus. . . . [and] may include or be accompanied by one or more motions.\" In short, unless a trial\ncourt grants a preliminary order in mandamus, Rule 94 does not authorize service of the petition in mandamus on\nthe respondent. And unless a trial court grants a preliminary order in mandamus, Rule 94 does not authorize the trial\ncourt to order the respondent to file an answer to the petition in mandamus.\n           7\n             Following Boresi, there remains an open question about whether an appeal is available where a petition in\nmandamus is denied after the grant of a preliminary order in mandamus but on other grounds than the merits of the\npetition. \"Although our research has not uncovered any Missouri Supreme Court cases addressing the issue, both\nthis Court and the Eastern District have concluded that even when a preliminary order has issued, the final decision\nis still not reviewable by appeal if it does not reach the merits of the relator's petition.\" Powell v. Dep't of Corr., 463\nS.W.3d 838, 841 n.3 (Mo. App. W.D. 2015) (citing Merell v. Dir. of Revenue, 82 S.W.3d 227, 230 (Mo. App. W.D.\n2002); State ex rel. Stoecker v. Dir. of Revenue, 734 S.W.2d 263, 266 (Mo. App. E.D. 1987)). This open question is\nnot implicated by the present appeal and is not addressed by our Opinion.\n           8\n             Powell holds that in the future, \"it is highly unlikely that the Missouri Supreme Court will exercise its\ndiscretion to hear an appeal on the merits where a summons, rather than a preliminary order, was issued by the\ncircuit court.\" 463 S.W.3d at 842.

The Petition alleged\n\nthat the Blue Springs R-IV School District, the Blue Springs School District Board of\n\nEducation, the superintendent of Blue Springs R-IV School District, and the assistant\n\nsuperintendent of Blue Springs R-IV School District, (collectively \"Respondents\"), had\n\nrefused to allow R.M.A., a transgender male, access to the boys restrooms and locker\n\nrooms. The Petition asserted that, pursuant to federal1 and Missouri law,2 R.M.A. has a\n\nright to access the boys restroom and locker rooms and that the Respondents have a clear\n\nand unconditional legal duty to provide R.M.A. with that access. The Petition requested\n\na writ of mandamus \"commanding Respondents to grant [R.M.A.] and all other\n\ntransgendered students of the Blue Springs R-IV School District full and equal access to\n\nthe appropriate restroom, locker room, and any other facilities segregated by sex as is\n\nconsistent with their gender identity.\"\n\n         The trial court did not initially deny the Petition. Nor did the trial court grant a\n\npreliminary order in mandamus. Rather, without being summoned or otherwise ordered\n\nby the court to do so, the Respondents filed an answer to the Petition on August 22, 2014,\n\nasking that the request for a writ of mandamus be denied and that the Petition be\n\ndismissed with prejudice.\n\n\n\n         1\n           In particular, the Petition cited the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX of\nthe Educational Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. sections 1681-1688.\n         2\n           In particular, the Petition cited to the Missouri Constitution article 1, section 2, and section 213.065. All\nstatutory references are to RSMo 2000 as supplemented unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                                            2\n\f         The trial court conducted a case management conference on November 5, 2014,\n\nand imposed a briefing schedule. In January 2015, the parties submitted stipulated facts\n\nto the trial court and filed briefs in support of their respective positions on the issues\n\nraised by the Petition.\n\n         The trial court held a hearing on February 11, 2015, to permit the parties to orally\n\nargue their positions based on the stipulated facts. At the conclusion of the hearing, the\n\ntrial court stated, \"I'm going to decide this based upon these arguments here, the briefs\n\nI've received, and my view of the law.\"\n\n         The trial court issued its judgment (\"Judgment\") on March 5, 2015, denying the\n\nPetition. The Judgment concluded that R.M.A. has \"no existing, clear, unconditional\n\nlegal right which allows . . . R.M.A. to access restrooms or locker rooms consistent with\n\nR.M.A.'s gender identity.\" The Judgment further concluded that a writ of mandamus was\n\ninappropriate because administrative remedies remained available to R.M.A.3\n\n         R.M.A., through his next friend, appeals.\n\n                                     Authority to Entertain Appeal\n\n         \"In every case before considering claims raised on appeal, this Court has a duty to\n\nsua sponte determine whether we have authority to decide the appeal.\" Collector of\n\nRevenue of City of St. Louis v.

Ordinarily, when a writ petition is denied, the appropriate recourse is to file the\n\ndenied writ petition in a higher court. Id. at 358 (citing Rules 84.22 to 84.26 and 94.01 et\n\nseq.). However, in limited circumstances, an appeal may be taken from the denial of a\n\nwrit petition. Id. Boresi, which reflects the Supreme Court's most recent discussion of\n\nthis topic, recognizes two such circumstances. First, \"[a]n appeal will lie from the denial\n\nof a writ petition when a lower court has issued a preliminary order in mandamus but\n\nthen denies a permanent writ.\" Id. (emphasis added) (citing State ex rel. Ashby Road\n\nPartners, LLC v.

Second, \"when the lower court issues a\n\nsummons, the functional equivalent of a preliminary order, and then denies a permanent\n\nwrit, appellate review is available.\" Id. at 359 (citing Ashby Rd. Partners, LLC, 297\n\nS.W.3d at 84).\n\n       Here, neither trigger permitting appellate review is present. After the Petition was\n\nfiled, the trial court did not grant a preliminary order in mandamus. Nor did the trial\n\ncourt issue a summons, the functional equivalent of a preliminary order in mandamus.\n\nRather, the parties and the trial court proceeded as if the Petition initiated an ordinary\n\ncivil action, seemingly oblivious to the requirements of Rule 94. And R.M.A. now seeks\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fappellate review of the Judgment's denial of the Petition on the merits, without regard to\n\nBoresi.\n\n       R.M.A.'s confusion over whether the Judgment is a final, appealable judgment\n\nmay be fueled by pre-Boresi precedent which suggests that the controlling factor in\n\ndetermining the right to appeal is whether a writ has been denied on the merits. See, e.g.,\n\nStone v. Mo. Dep't of Corr., Prob. & Parole Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890096\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890096/stone-v-missouri-dept-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160 (Mo. App. W.D.\n\n2010) (holding that \"when the circuit court denies a petition for writ of mandamus\n\nfollowing an answer or motion directed to the merits of the controversy and, in doing so,\n\ndetermines a question of fact or law, we treat the court's ruling as final and appealable\").\n\nGiven Stone and other similar cases, it is perhaps understandable that parties and trial\n\ncourts have focused on posturing mandamus proceedings for disposition on the merits,\n\nplacing no utility on abiding by the procedures described in Rule 94.\n\n       In announcing when an appeal will be permitted following denial of a permanent\n\nwrit, Boresi did not address Stone or other similar cases which hold that an appeal will lie\n\nfrom a trial court's denial of a writ petition on the merits. However, it is difficult to read\n\nBoresi as endorsing continued reliance on this legal principle in cases where Rule 94 has\n\nnot been followed.4\n\n       As noted, Boresi held an appeal \"will lie\" from the denial of a permanent writ by a\n\nlower court after issuance of a preliminary writ. 396 S.W.3d at 358. And Boresi held an\n\nappeal \"is available\" when a permanent writ is denied by a lower court after \"the lower\n\ncourt issues a summons, the functional equivalent of a preliminary order.\" Id. at 359.\n\n       4\n           See footnote 7 infra.\n\n                                              5\n\fThe phrase \"is available\" is markedly different from the phrase \"will lie,\" implying that\n\nthere is no appeal as a matter of right unless a preliminary writ has been issued before a\n\npermanent writ is denied, and implying that an appeal is only available as a matter of\n\ndiscretion where a trial court issues a summons that can be viewed as the \"functional\n\nequivalent\" of a preliminary writ. This supposition is confirmed by a footnote in Boresi:\n\n         [T]he . . . practice of issuing a summons in lieu of a preliminary writ is not\n         authorized by Rule 94.5 Writs are extraordinary remedies, and their\n         procedures differ from normal civil actions. The practice of issuing a\n         summons rather that a preliminary order fails to acknowledge the nature of\n         the remedy. Additionally, it requires a response from the respondent\n         without regard to the merits of the petition. Nevertheless, this Court is\n         exercising its discretion to consider the matter on the merits and issue the\n         writ because the parties, who already have litigated the matter fully, were\n         not at fault and should not be required to initiate a new writ proceeding due\n         to the circuit court's failure to follow the procedure proscribed by the rules.\n         This Court is not required to exercise its discretion in like manner in the\n         future.\n\n396 S.W.3d at 356 n.1. Plainly, Boresi holds that trial courts and parties are not free to\n\ndisregard the plain language of Rule 94. Plainly, Boresi holds that the ability to seek\n\nappellate review from the denial of a permanent writ (as opposed to the right to file a\n\ndenied writ in a higher court) is tied to compliance with the provisions of Rule 94.6 In\n\n\n         5\n            The Supreme Court similarly held in Ashby Road Partners, LLC that \"[t]he issuance of a summons is not\nauthorized or anticipated by Rule 97\" in lieu of issuance of a preliminary writ in a prohibition proceeding. 297\nS.W.3d at 84.\n          6\n            This is in keeping with the fact that the procedures for writs (which seek extraordinary remedies) differ\nfrom the procedures in civil proceedings. Boresi, 396 S.W.3d at 359 n.1. Rule 94 provides that \"[p]roceedings in\nmandamus in a circuit court shall be as prescribed in this Rule 94.\" Rule 94.01. To seek a writ of mandamus from a\ncircuit court, a relator must file a petition in mandamus containing \"a statement of the facts, the relief sought, and a\nstatement of the reasons why the writ should issue,\" \"accompanied by suggestions in support thereof.\" Rule 94.03.\nThe petition must also be accompanied by all documents \"essential to an understanding of the matters set forth in the\npetition.\" Id. These pleading requirements are designed to afford the trial court with the information necessary to\nassess the preliminary merits of an extraordinary writ request.\n          Rule 94.04 provides that \"[i]f the court is of the opinion that the preliminary order in mandamus should be\ngranted, such order shall be issued.\" If a preliminary order is issued, Rule 94.05 provides that \"[t]he preliminary\norder shall order the respondent to file an answer within the time fixed by the order,\" and \"[t]he clerk shall . . .\n\n                                                           6\n\flight of Boresi, we cannot discern a reasoned path that would permit this court to\n\nconclude that an appeal will lie as a matter of right merely and solely because a\n\npermanent writ is denied by a lower court on the merits. Instead, we conclude, as is\n\nalready stated in Boresi, that an appeal will lie as a matter of right only where a\n\npermanent writ of mandamus is denied by a lower court on the merits after that court has\n\nissued a preliminary writ.7 396 S.W.3d at 358. And if Rule 94 is not followed, then there\n\nis no right of appeal from the denial of a permanent writ of mandamus (even if on the\n\nmerits), with the narrow proviso that an appeal may be permitted as a matter of discretion\n\nwhere a permanent writ of mandamus is denied on the merits after a trial court has issued\n\na summons that can be fairly characterized as the \"functional equivalent\" of a preliminary\n\nwrit.8 Id. at 359.\n\n         Here, there was no summons issued by the trial court nor any grant of a\n\npreliminary order in mandamus. Rather, the parties and the trial court appear simply to\n\n\n\ndeliver a copy of the preliminary order, together with a copy of the petition, for service . . . . [which] may be made\nas provided in Rule 54.\" Rule 94.07 requires that \"[t]he answer [ordered by Rule 94.05] shall be directed to the\npetition in mandamus. . . . [and] may include or be accompanied by one or more motions.\" In short, unless a trial\ncourt grants a preliminary order in mandamus, Rule 94 does not authorize service of the petition in mandamus on\nthe respondent. And unless a trial court grants a preliminary order in mandamus, Rule 94 does not authorize the trial\ncourt to order the respondent to file an answer to the petition in mandamus.\n           7\n             Following Boresi, there remains an open question about whether an appeal is available where a petition in\nmandamus is denied after the grant of a preliminary order in mandamus but on other grounds than the merits of the\npetition. \"Although our research has not uncovered any Missouri Supreme Court cases addressing the issue, both\nthis Court and the Eastern District have concluded that even when a preliminary order has issued, the final decision\nis still not reviewable by appeal if it does not reach the merits of the relator's petition.\" Powell v.

This open question is\nnot implicated by the present appeal and is not addressed by our Opinion.\n           8\n             Powell holds that in the future, \"it is highly unlikely that the Missouri Supreme Court will exercise its\ndiscretion to hear an appeal on the merits where a summons, rather than a preliminary order, was issued by the\ncircuit court.\" 463 S.W.3d at 842. Powell thus declined to exercise discretion to treat a trial court issued summons\nas the functional equivalent of a preliminary order in mandamus, noting its perception that \"Boresi [is] guidance that\nwe generally should decline to exercise our discretion to hear appeals on the merits in writ proceedings where a\nsummons rather than a preliminary order has been issued by the circuit court.\" Id.\n\n                                                            7\n\fhave dissregarded Rule\n                  R    94, Boresi,\n                           B       and the cases addressingg Boresi thhat have plainly\n\n                   urts and parrties about the importtance of folllowing thee procedurees set\ncounseleed trial cou\n\n         R 94.9\nforth in Rule\n\n         The\n         T trial cou\n                   urt's denial of\n                                o the Petitiion affords R.M.A. noo more recouurse than w\n                                                                                       would\n\n                            A. had the Petition beeen denied shortly aft\nhave been availablle to R.M.A                                         fter it was ffiled.\n\nR.M.A. has the rig\n                 ght to file the\n                             t Petition\n                                      n in a higheer court.
