      "attorneys": "Engle  Laub,  of Natchez, for appellant.\n\nThe appellant was convicted in the circuit court of Adams County, Mississippi, on an affidavit which attempts to charge the offense of obscenity in a public place. It will be noted that the affidavit does not charge the obscene language was used in the presence of two or more persons, as required by Section 1059, Code of 1930 (being Section 2291 of the Code of 1942). The ordinance of the city of Natchez introduced in evidence bears date of May 25, 1926, and reads as follows: \"Section 1: Be it ordained by the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Natchez, in council convened, that if any person shall profanely swear or curse, or use vulgar or indecent language, or be drunk in any public place within the corporate limits of the City of Natchez, he shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than one hundred dollars.\" The ordinance is in conflict with the codal provision respecting this offense in that the ordinance does not require the offense to be committed in the presence of two or more persons.\n\nThe charter of the City of Natchez is incorporated in an act to amend and reduce into one act the act incorporating the City of Natchez and several acts amendatory thereto, approved January 29, 1877, and as amended by act approved February 10, 1888. Section 25 of the charter of the City of Natchez provides: \"Sec. 25. Be it further enacted, That the said Mayor and Aldermen, in council, shall have power to pass all ordinances and by-laws, not inconsistent with the laws of the United States, and of this State, which may be necessary or proper to carry into effect the powers delegated to them in this Act, with power also to prescribe, in such ordinances, such fines and forfeitures for their violation, as may be expedient, not exceeding five hundred dollars for each offense and imprisonment not exceeding ninety days, for a single offense; and all such ordinances to repeal and amend at pleasure.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing it is apparent that the ordinance itself is in conflict or inconsistent with the state law, and, therefore, the City of Natchez had no authority to adopt such an ordinance. The ordinance is objectionable for the further reason that it was not adopted in the manner and form provided by the laws of Mississippi for the adoption of the ordinance relating to criminal offenses. Section 2549 of the Code of 1930 (being Section 3660 of the Code of 1942) is identical in language with Section 9540 of Hemingway's Code of 1917, which provides the method of making offenses against the state offenses against a municipality and fixes the method of so doing by the adoption of a general ordinance and not by the adoption of a special ordinance. Had the City of Natchez adopted a general ordinance by the method provided in the Code, then the Code provisions, as set out in Section 1059, Code of 1930, would have been written into the municipal law; however, instead of adopting a general ordinance the City of Natchez undertook to take care of the situation by a separate ordinance and when the city undertook to do this, then the language of the separate ordinance should have been consistent and in accord with the language in the Mississippi Code.\n\nThere is the further objection to this ordinance in that it was never published as required by the law of Mississippi relating to municipalities nor by Section 41 of the charter of the City of Natchez which provides that all ordinances passed by the Mayor and Aldermen shall within ten days after the passage thereof be published in one or more newspapers in said city. When the ordinance book containing this ordinance was offered in evidence, its introduction was objected to because it did not appear in the minutes and the enactment of the ordinance had not been properly established. The prosecution understood this to mean that the ordinance had not been published and that it did not appear in the minutes. The Court held up its ruling to allow counsel an opportunity to get the minutes and find out if the ordinance appeared\nin the minutes and if it had been published. An amendment to the stenographer's notes shows that the court adjourned for several hours to allow counsel for city to produce the minutes of the City of Natchez to show that the ordinance appeared in the minutes and was adopted, but on the court reconvening the city did not offer the minutes and no minutes were offered in evidence. The point we make here is that the city having undertaken to meet the objection by producing the minutes should have been required to produce the minutes and was precluded from relying on any presumption that the ordinance was properly adopted.\n\nObjection was made to the introduction of the ordinance for the above reasons and the objection was overruled by the court.\n\nThe place where the alleged obscene language was used was not a public place.\n\nMadison Products Co., Inc., et al. v. Coler, Commissioner of Public Welfare et al.,  152 N.E. 264 ; State v. Colgan,  82 N.J.L. 307 , 108 A. 108, 109; Hopwood v. City of Pittsburgh,  152 Pa. Super. 398 ,   33 A.2d 658 ; Century Dictionary, \"public\"; New International Dictionary, \"public\"; 32 Cyc. 748; 35 Words and Phrases 271; 1944 Cumulative Annual Pocket Part to 35 Words and Phrases, p. 35.\n\nThe construction given by the lower court to the phrase \"public place\" in view of the facts is tantamount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n\n13th and 14th amendments to the Federal Constitution.\n\n Gerard H. Brandon,  of Natchez, for appellee.\n\nThe ordinance was admissible in evidence without proof of publication.\n\nCode of 1942, Sec. 3658.\n\nThe ordinance was not invalid because different from a similar state statute.\n\n37 Am. Jur. 787-791, Municipal Corporations, Sec. 165.\n\nWe submit that under the rule announced in the foregoing text, to the attention of which we invite the court, the state statute neither permits a thing to be done which is specifically authorized to be done by the city ordinance nor does the state statute prohibit the doing of a thing which has been permitted by the city ordinance. Conversely, the city ordinance does not attempt to prohibit a thing specifically authorized or licensed by the state, nor does the city ordinance permit or license the doing of anything expressly prohibited by the state statutes. Hence there is no merit to the contention made by the appellant.\n\nThe restaurant was a public place though negroes and Chinamen were not served therein. If this court should adopt the narrow definition of what is a \"public place\" sought to be invoked by counsel for appellant, there would be few places in the state of Mississippi, other than the public streets and highways, which would fall within that definition, in view of the race segregation statutes adopted by the legislature of the State of Mississippi, and in view of the prevailing policy in this state, recognized and practiced as advisable by both races, under which separate and distinct accommodations are afforded to citizens of different races. People of the white or Caucasion race constitute a very large body of the population in Mississippi and hence a place which serves without other restrictions all persons of the white race who choose to be served therein is a public place. If the restaurant, serving as it did only persons of the white race, was not a public place, then our schools are not public places, our recreation grounds are not public places, the hotels in this state are not public places, no restaurant in the state is a public place, our churches and municipal auditoriums are not public places. Indeed, if the rule of exclusion be carried to embrace segregation, our court houses are not public places, for therein separate places are set aside for occupancy by our colored citizens and separate places are set aside for our white\ncitizens. If the theory sought to be advanced by our opposing counsel should be established, then no railroad car, street car, or bus could be held as a public place in view of the segregation statutes of this state. A public place is any place so situated that what passes there can be seen by a considerable number of persons, if they happen to look.\n\nOrf v.
