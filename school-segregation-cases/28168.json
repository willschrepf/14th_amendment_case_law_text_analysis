We affirm the class certification but modify the certified class\n\nrelief on remand.\n\n                                           ISSUES\n\n¶2     We restate the issues on appeal as follows:\n\n¶3     1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by finding that the proposed class\n\nmet the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)?\n\n¶4     2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by certifying a M. R. Civ. P.\n\n23(b)(2) class action lawsuit?\n\n¶5     3. Whether the District Court erred by holding that the Montana Rules of Evidence\n\ndo not apply to class action proceedings?\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶6     This interlocutory appeal arises from the District Court’s order certifying a class in\n\nJacobsen’s class action against Allstate. Jacobsen’s class action claim in turn arose out of\n\nour remand of his initial non-class third-party claim against Allstate in Jacobsen v. Allstate\n\nIns. Co., 2009 MT 248, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649 (Jacobsen I). As we recounted in\n\nJacobsen I, Jacobsen suffered bodily injuries and property damage in an automobile accident\n\ncaused by Allstate’s insured in 2001. Allstate admitted liability and negotiated a settlement\n\nwith Jacobsen while he was unrepresented by counsel. Allstate’s adjuster, Chuck Conners\n\n                                               3\n\f(Conners) used Allstate’s Claim Core Process Redesign (CCPR) program to process\n\nJacobsen’s claim. The CCPR is a system of claims adjusting guidelines that Allstate\n\nimplemented in 1995 to fast track settlements and reduce the amount paid out on claims.\n\nConners utilized the general outlines of the CCPR in settling Jacobsen’s claim. The program\n\nfacilitated a quick, unrepresented settlement six days after the accident for $3,500 and 45\n\ndays of “open” medical payment. As part of the settlement, Jacobsen signed a release.\n\n¶7     Roughly three weeks later, Jacobsen began experiencing significant pain. Jacobsen\n\ncontacted Conners and asked him to reconsider the release and provide additional assistance.\n\nConners refused because Jacobsen had signed a release. Jacobsen retained counsel, who\n\nsuccessfully persuaded Allstate to rescind the release and re-open Jacobsen’s claim. Due to\n\nthe efforts of Jacobsen’s newly-hired attorney, Allstate settled Jacobsen’s claim for $200,000\n\non November 27, 2002, roughly 18 months after his initial, unrepresented settlement for\n\n$3,500.\n\n¶8     Thereafter, Jacobsen retained new counsel and filed a complaint against Allstate\n\nseeking compensatory damages for various violations of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices\n\nAct (UTPA), common law bad faith, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress\n\n(IIED and NIED respectively), and also seeking punitive damages pursuant to § 27-1-221,\n\nMCA. Jacobsen ultimately sought compensatory damages based on the attorney fees he\n\nincurred in pursuing his underlying claim and punitive damages based on Allstate’s alleged\n\nmalicious conduct.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f¶9     The jury returned a verdict in favor of Jacobsen on October 19, 2006, finding Allstate\n\nliable for common law and statutory bad faith and awarding Jacobsen $68,372.38 in\n\ncompensatory damages. The jury specifically found that Allstate violated the UTPA by\n\nmisrepresenting pertinent facts regarding the claim and neglecting to attempt in good faith to\n\npromptly, fairly, and equitably settle a claim in which liability was reasonably clear. The\n\njury also awarded Jacobsen $350,000 in punitive damages based on its finding that Allstate\n\nacted with actual malice.\n\n¶10    Following the verdict, both Jacobsen and Allstate appealed various rulings by the\n\nDistrict Court. Our resolution of these appeals comprises Jacobsen I. One issue under\n\nconsideration in Jacobsen I concerned the discovery of what were termed the “McKinsey\n\ndocuments.” The McKinsey documents consist of around 12,500 PowerPoint slides\n\nproduced by McKinsey & Company (McKinsey), a management consulting firm, for\n\nAllstate. The CCPR program is a distillation of the studies and recommendations contained\n\nin the McKinsey documents, and they consequently provide a more complete understanding\n\nof the program. However, Jacobsen was unaware of the existence of the McKinsey\n\ndocuments at the time of his initial discovery request or motion to compel production of the\n\nCCPR. When he became aware of them, Jacobsen sought leave of the court to assert new\n\nindividual and class action claims against Allstate and to pursue additional discovery. The\n\nDistrict Court denied these requests, finding that they would “cause substantial prejudice and\n\nundue delay, burden, and expense[.]” Jacobsen I, ¶ 55.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f¶11    In his pre-remand appeal, Jacobsen argued that the District Court erred by denying his\n\nrequest for further discovery. We found that because “the issue before the District Court was\n\nnot whether to re-open discovery, but whether to compel Allstate to produce documents that\n\nwere within Jacobsen’s original discovery request,” it was “unnecessary to determine\n\nwhether Jacobsen demonstrated due diligence or excusable neglect[.]” Jacobsen I, ¶ 57. We\n\nconcluded “[t]he McKinsey documents were indeed critical to Jacobsen’s theory that\n\nAllstate’s policies regarding unrepresented claimants constituted bad faith” and reversed the\n\nDistrict Court’s decision. Jacobsen I, ¶ 58.\n\n¶12    We ultimately remanded the case for a new trial, finding that the jury’s award of\n\ncompensatory damages could not be based solely on Jacobsen’s incurred attorney costs and\n\nfees and that there could be no punitive damages following this reversal of the compensatory\n\ndamages award. We also ordered the court to allow the jury to consider Jacobsen’s\n\nemotional distress damages and directed the District Court to compel the production of the\n\nMcKinsey documents. Jacobsen I, ¶ 67.\n\n¶13    On remand, bolstered by the production of the McKinsey documents, Jacobsen filed a\n\nmotion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint that added class action claims\n\nconcerning Allstate’s CCPR program.         Count Four of Jacobsen’s Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint, filed May 6, 2010, contained the newly-added class action claims. Jacobsen\n\nbased the class claims on his prior individual theories asserting violations of the UTPA1 and\n\n\n       1\n      Jacobsen specifically alleged Allstate’s CCPR violated §§ 33-18-201(1) & (6),\nMCA. Section 33-18-201(1), MCA, prohibits misrepresenting “pertinent facts or\n                                          6\n\fcommon law bad faith. Specifically, Count Four alleged that Allstate’s CCPR program\n\nviolated the UTPA “and/or common law bad faith laws” by intentionally misrepresenting\n\nthat unrepresented claimants generally received more compensation than represented\n\nclaimants and by settling unrepresented claims via an inadequate “fast track” component of\n\nthe CCPR that resulted in unfair settlements. Count Four asserted these claims on behalf of\n\n“all unrepresented individuals who had either third party claims or first party claims against\n\nAllstate whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana using its CCPR program.”\n\n¶14    Count Five presented a claim for a common fund recovery of attorney fees incurred in\n\npursuing the class action, and Count Six presented a claim for attorney fees as a “Private\n\nAttorney General” by asserting that the State of Montana had failed to enforce §§ 33-18-\n\n201(1) and (6), MCA. Regarding class relief, Jacobsen requested class certification,\n\ninjunctive relief prohibiting Allstate from using the CCPR program in Montana, an\n\ninjunction requiring Allstate to “re-open all claims in which liability was reasonable [sic]\n\nclear in which the Defendant applied the CCPR paradigm in settling such cases,” an\n\ninjunction requiring Allstate to disgorge unlawful profits, the award of punitive damages,\n\nand attorney fees.\n\n¶15    Jacobsen filed a motion for class certification on May 7, 2010, proposing a class\n\ndefinition encompassing “all unrepresented individuals who had either third-party claims or\n\n\n\n\ninsurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.” Section 33-18-201(6)\nprohibits neglecting “to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable\nsettlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.”\n                                              7\n\ffirst-party claims against Allstate whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana using\n\nits CCPR program.”\n\n¶16    The District Court certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class in its methodical June 30, 2012\n\nOrder. In the course of its analysis, the Court noted the United States Supreme Court’s\n\nadmonition in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551-52 (2011), to conduct a\n\n“rigorous” Rule 23 analysis. The Court also construed the substantive essence of Plaintiff’s\n\nasserted class claim to be, irrespective of individual outcomes, that the CCPR’s settlement\n\npractices “constitute a common pattern and practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6),\n\nMCA, as generally applied to the class as a whole, thereby resulting in indivisible harm to\n\nthe class as a whole . . . .” The court accordingly certified the following class claim:\n\n       (A) the Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment adjusting practices are a\n       common pattern and practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as\n       generally applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole;\n\n       (B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana\n       caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum\n       economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between\n       Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; and\n\n       (C) Allstate acted with “actual malice,” as defined by § 27-1-221(2), MCA, by\n       intentionally, deliberately, and consciously creating and disregarding a high\n       probability that the net effect of its Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment\n       practices would result in net settlement payouts to the class as a whole less\n       than the net amount previously sufficient to fully and fairly settle\n       unrepresented claims under Montana law[.]\n\nAs support, the Court found that Jacobsen had proffered “substantial credible evidence” that\n\nAllstate systematically adjusted unrepresented first and third-party claims involving bodily\n\n\n                                              8\n\finjury or property damage “in the same general manner” under the CCPR program. The\n\nCourt thus rejected Allstate’s claim that Jacobsen could not establish that all unrepresented\n\nclaimant’s settlements were unfair by reasoning that Jacobsen’s claims concerned the\n\n“preliminary manner, means, and course of adjustment systematically applied to the class as\n\na whole in the context of the insurer’s duties under §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA,” and not\n\nthe “ultimate outcomes” of individual claims.\n\n¶17    The Court restructured Jacobsen’s class definition as follows:\n\n       (1) all unrepresented claimants who made first-party or third-party claims to\n       Allstate;\n       (2) for an amount in excess of the applicable policy deductible;\n       (3) for bodily injury or property damage related to an underlying motor\n       vehicle incident or occurrence; and\n       (4) whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana to an unrepresented\n       settlement since deployment in Montana of the various versions of the\n       Casualty CCPR (CCPR Implementation Manual (Tort States)).\n\nThe Court considered this reformed definition to be “sufficiently precise and homogenous\n\nfor purposes of Rule 23.” Using this reformed class definition the Court determined that\n\nJacobsen’s class claim satisfied Rule 23(a)’s four prerequisites—numerosity, commonality,\n\ntypicality, and adequacy. The Court certified Jacobsen’s claim as a Rule 23(b)(2) class\n\naction and certified the following class action remedies as available upon proof of the\n\ncertified class claim:\n\n       (A) [a] declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of the\n       certified class claim [which we have recounted in ¶ 16];\n\n       (B) [a] mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f              (1) give all class members court-appointed notice of the right and\n              opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment of their\n              individual claims by timely returning a proof of claim form; and\n\n              (2) re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt of a\n              timely filed proof of claim;\n\n       (C) class-wide punitive damages pursuant to §§ 27-1-220 and 27-1-221(2),\n       MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-referenced class-wide conduct;\n       and\n\n       (D) common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs upon a\n       class-wide punitive damages award[.]\n\nAllstate appeals the court’s certification of Jacobsen’s class claims pursuant to Rule 232 as\n\nwell as the court’s consideration of what Allstate argues was inadmissible evidence during\n\nthe certification proceedings.\n\nAllstate’s CCPR Program and the McKinsey Documents.\n\n¶18    Due to Jacobsen’s contention that Allstate’s application of the CCPR program to\n\nunrepresented claimants amounts to statutory and common law bad faith, a brief summary of\n\nthe program, and the related McKinsey documents, is in order.\n\n¶19    Allstate hired McKinsey in the early 1990’s to help redesign its claims process. This\n\nredesign was prompted by Allstate’s recognition that while claims expenses were low, total\n\npayouts were increasing at a pace above the industry average. The McKinsey documents\n\noutlined a claim settlement process, like the CCPR program, to lower claims payouts by\n\nincreasing claimant contact and reducing attorney involvement. McKinsey essentially\n\n\n       2\n         A more thorough analysis of the District Court’s application of Rule 23(a) and\n(b) will be provided in the course of our legal discussion.\n                                             10\n\fadvocated “increasing the number of early unrepresented settlements” while “holding the\n\nline” on represented claims. This focus flowed from research showing that represented\n\nclaims settled for 2-3 times more than unrepresented claims, that Allstate claims adjusters\n\nwere not effectively initiating early contact or communicating with claimants, and that this\n\nfailure to promptly and effectively communicate with claimants made claimants more likely\n\nto hire lawyers. The McKinsey documents ultimately styled claims adjusting as a “zero\n\nsum” economic game where if Allstate gains by reducing settlements, others—including\n\n“medical providers, plaintiff attorneys, and claimants”—“must lose.”\n\n¶20    Allstate’s CCPR program consequently strives to reduce overall claims payouts by\n\nestablishing a more centralized, regimented claims adjusting process focused on quick\n\nclaimant contact, building rapport, reducing claimant representation rates, and shuttling\n\ncertain claims into a “fast track” system. Allstate applies the CCPR to both third and first-\n\nparty claimants.\n\n¶21    Here, Allstate’s adjuster, Conners, utilized the CCPR program to obtain a fast track,\n\nunrepresented, reduced payment settlement of Jacobsen’s claim. Jacobsen alleges that the\n\nCCPR program systematically violates the rights of unrepresented claimants as provided to\n\nthem by the UTPA. Jacobsen specifically takes issue with the application of the CCRP’s\n\n“fast track” system, “9-step process,” and “attorney economics script” to his claim.\n\n¶22    First, the “fast track” system seeks to promote settlement with claimants within 12\n\ndays of the accident. Jacobsen alleges that the system promotes quick settlements at the\n\nexpense of fair settlements. A “Fast Track Evaluation Worksheet” controls whether a claim\n                                             11\n\fis amenable to “fast track” processing and requires: the claimant is unrepresented, there are\n\nno coverage questions, there are only soft tissue injuries and a good prognosis, no residuals,\n\nno aggravation of preexisting conditions, and treatment for less than 60 days. In this case,\n\nafter Jacobsen accepted the initial $3,500 settlement, Conners processed Jacobsen’s claim\n\nunder the CCPR’s “fast track” guidelines for unrepresented claims.\n\n¶23    Second, Conners generally utilized the “9-step process” for unrepresented claimant\n\ncontact. The CCPR’s Initial Claimant Contact Outline for unrepresented claimants directs\n\nadjusters to: (1) establish empathy and gather injury facts; (2) confirm Allstate’s customer\n\nservice pledge; (3) gather loss facts; (4) confirm Allstate’s liability decision; (5) discuss\n\npayment of medical bills and lost wages; (6) assist with car repairs; (7) assist with alternate\n\ntransportation; (8) explain the bodily injury settlement process and discuss attorney\n\neconomics; and (9) close the claim and follow-up. Jacobsen alleges the 9-step process\n\nincreases Allstate’s profits at the expense of good faith settlements.\n\n¶24    Third, in accordance with the CCPR, Conners discussed attorney economics with\n\nJacobsen. The CCPR process explicitly seeks to reduce the number of represented claims to\n\nreduce claims payouts. This goal was motivated by Allstate’s determination that represented\n\nclaimants typically settled for 2-3 times (and perhaps up to 5 times) the amount\n\nunrepresented claimants received. To reduce attorney involvement, the CCPR aims to build\n\nrapport with claimants though quick, empathetic contact, and directs adjusters to utilize an\n\n“attorney economics script.” The script states:\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       [q]uite often our customers ask if an attorney is necessary to settle a claim.\n       Some people choose to hire an attorney, but we would really like the\n       opportunity to work directly with you to settle the claim.\n\n       Attorneys commonly take between 25-40% of the total settlement you receive\n       . . . plus expenses incurred. If you settle directly with Allstate, however, the\n       total amount of the settlement is yours.\n\n       At any time in the process you may choose to hire an attorney. I would,\n       however, like to make an offer to you first. This way, should you go to an\n       attorney, you would be able to negotiate with the attorney so his/her fees\n       would only apply to amounts over my offer to you.\n\nThe script’s instructions counsel against improperly dissuading claimants from seeking\n\nrepresentation and instruct adjusters to remind claimants that they are free to hire an attorney\n\nat any time and discuss the relevant statute of limitations. However, the script does not\n\ncontain information advising that Allstate found that represented claimants generally\n\nreceived higher settlements. Jacobsen alleges Allstate’s portrayal of “attorney economics”\n\ninduced him into believing unrepresented claimants generally received more compensation\n\nfor injuries and resulted in an initially unfair settlement.\n\n\n\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶25    We afford trial courts the broadest discretion when reviewing a decision on class\n\ncertification.

We will\n\n\n                                               13\n\ftherefore not upset the District Court’s decision without finding an abuse of discretion. In\n\nconducting this review we do not ask whether we would have reached the same decision, but\n\ninstead ask whether the district court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or\n\nexceeded the bounds of reason. Newman v. Lichfield, 2012 MT 47, ¶ 22, 364 Mont. 243, 272\n\nP.3d 625. However, ‘ “[t]o the extent that the ruling on a Rule 23 requirement is supported\n\nby a finding of fact, that finding, like any other finding of fact, is reviewed under the ‘clearly\n\nerroneous’ standard. And to the extent that the ruling involves an issue of law, review is de\n\nnovo.” ’ Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., 2012 MT 318, ¶ 17, 368 Mont. 1, 291 P.3d 1209\n\n(Mattson III) (quoting Miles v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 471 F.3d 24, 40-41 (2d Cir. 2006)).\n\n\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n¶26 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by finding that the proposed class\nmet the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)?\n\n       A. Rule 23(a)\n\n¶27    Initially, a class action claim is “ ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is\n\nconducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.’ ” Mattson III, ¶ 18\n\n(quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01, 99 S. Ct. 2545 (1979)). Departure\n\n\n                                               14\n\ffrom the usual rule is justified if the class representative is part of the class and possesses the\n\nsame interest and suffers the same injury as the class members. East Tex. Motor Freight\n\nSystem, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403, 97 S. Ct. 1891 (1977). In this way, class action\n\nsuits save the resources of courts and parties “ ‘by permitting an issue potentially affecting\n\nevery [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion under Rule 23.’ ” Gen. Tel.\n\nCo. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 155, 102 S. Ct. 2364 (1982) (quoting Califano,\n\n442 U.S. at 701).\n\n¶28    Rule 23 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure governs certification of a class\n\naction and ensures that the named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class.\n\nBecause the Montana version of Rule 23 is identical to the corresponding federal rule,\n\nfederal authority is instructive, but Montana courts are not required to march lockstep with\n\nfederal interpretations of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Chipman, ¶ 43. The four requirements found in\n\nRule 23(a) provide the threshold inquiry courts engage in when considering a putative class.\n\nSpecifically, Rule 23(a) requires that:\n\n       (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;\n       (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n       (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims\n       or defenses of the class; and\n       (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of\n       the class.\n\nThese prerequisites are intended to protect the due process rights of absent class members,\n\nHansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 42-43, 61 S. Ct. 115 (1940), and failure to establish any\n\nelement of Rule 23(a) is fatal to class certification. Chipman, ¶ 43.\n\n\n                                                15\n\f¶29    Moreover, we have recently adopted the following guidelines in an attempt to provide\n\nfurther clarification of Rule 23’s proper standard of review:\n\n       (1) a district judge may certify a class only after making determinations that\n       each of the Rule 23 requirements has been met; (2) such determinations can be\n       made only if the judge resolves factual disputes relevant to each Rule 23\n       requirement and finds that whatever underlying facts are relevant to a\n       particular Rule 23 requirement have been established and is persuaded to rule,\n       based on the relevant facts and the applicable legal standard, that the\n       requirement is met; (3) the obligation to make such determinations is not\n       lessened by overlap between a Rule 23 requirement and a merits issue, even a\n       merits issue that is identical with a Rule 23 requirement; (4) in making such\n       determinations, a district judge should not assess any aspect of the merits\n       unrelated to a Rule 23 requirement; and (5) a district judge has ample\n       discretion to circumscribe both the extent of discovery concerning Rule 23\n       requirements and the extent of a hearing to determine whether such\n       requirements are met in order to assure that a class certification motion does\n       not become a pretext for a partial trial of the merits.\n\nMattson v. Mont. Power Co., 2009 MT 286, ¶ 67, 352 Mont. 212, 215 P.3d 675 (Matson II).\n\nOur application of these guidelines to the District Court’s certification order in this case\n\nleads us to the conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by certifying\n\nJacobsen’s proposed class. The District Court based its class certification on a meticulous\n\nreview of the evidence behind the pleadings. As class certification requires that the plaintiff\n\nsatisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a), we will address each requirement in turn.\n\n              i. Numerosity—Rule 23(a)(1)\n\n¶30    As noted, Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the proposed class be “so numerous that joinder\n\nof all members is impracticable.” Here, the Court found that Jacobsen, using the deposition\n\nof Allstate Agent Conners, “reasonably estimated the size of the first proposed class [in\n\nJacobsen I] at around 600 members.” Because Jacobsen had enlarged the class post-remand\n                                              16\n\fby adding first-party claimants and automobile-related property damage claims, the Court\n\nconcluded that the post-remand class met Rule 23(a)(1)’s numerosity requirement. Allstate\n\ndoes not challenge this conclusion on appeal.\n\n              ii. Commonality—Rule 23(a)(2)\n\n¶31    Allstate does contest the Court’s finding that the proposed class satisfied the\n\ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). Rule 23(a)(2) requires “questions of law or fact\n\ncommon to the class.” Because the requirements of the rule are disjunctive, a party seeking\n\nclass certification must have either common questions of law or fact, and total commonality\n\nis not required. Sieglock, ¶ 11. The commonality requirement has therefore generally been\n\nseen as a relatively low burden for plaintiffs. See Diaz v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 2011\n\nMT 322, ¶ 32, 363 Mont. 151, 267 P.3d 756 (quoting LaBauve v. Olin Corp., 231 F.R.D.\n\n632, 667-68 (S.D.Ala. 2005)) (commonality requirement is met when a single issue is\n\ncommon to all class members); Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 2009 MT 109, ¶ 26, 342\n\nMont. 380, 180 P.3d 1164 (citing LaBauve, 231 F.R.D. at 668) (commonality “is not a\n\nstringent threshold and does not impose an unwieldy burden on plaintiffs.”); McDonald v.\n\nWashington, 261 Mont. 392, 401, 862 P.2d 1150 (quoting Jordan v. County of Los Angeles,\n\n669 F.2d 1311, 1320 (9th Cir. 1982)).\n\n¶32    As these cases indicate, we have a “long history of relying on federal jurisprudence\n\nwhen interpreting the class certification requirements of Rule 23.” Chipman, ¶ 52. Federal\n\nRule 23(a)(2) jurisprudence was further developed in 2011 by the U.S. Supreme Court in\n\nWal-Mart v. Dukes. The Wal-Mart decision has raised the dual questions of whether it plots\n                                            17\n\fa new course for “commonality” analysis and if this course materially differs from our own.\n\nWe first considered Wal-Mart’s treatment of Rule 23(a)(2) in Chipman. There, we\n\nrecognized that the Wal-Mart decision had departed from our heretofore “minimal standard”\n\nand had “significantly tightened the commonality requirement.” Chipman, ¶¶ 47-48. We\n\nthen applied the Wal-Mart decision’s “reasoning” concerning Rule 23(a)(2) and upheld the\n\nclass certification order. Chipman, ¶¶ 47, 52. We next considered Rule 23(a)(2) and Wal-\n\nMart two months later in our Mattson III decision. There, we again referenced the Supreme\n\nCourt’s apparent tightening of Federal Rule 23(a)(2)’s requirements and noted “a recent\n\ndivergence between the federal approach and Montana’s approach to the commonality\n\nrequirement.”    Mattson III, ¶ 35.      However, despite our application of Wal-Mart’s\n\n“reasoning” in Chipman, the Mattson III decision portrayed our decision to follow Wal-\n\nMart’s interpretation of Rule 23(a)(2) as an open question best left for some “future case.”\n\nMattson III, ¶ 37. Despite disclaiming our adoption of Wal-Mart’s commonality reasoning,\n\nMattson III still analyzed, and upheld, the District Court’s class certification pursuant to the\n\nsupposedly “more stringent” federal standard. Mattson III, ¶ 37.\n\n¶33    As Justice Baker observed in her dissenting opinion in Mattson III, our varying\n\nembrace of Wal-Mart in Chipman and Mattson III perhaps “introduce[d] confusion into our\n\nclass certification standards . . . .” Mattson III, ¶ 45 (J. Baker, dissenting). Our opinion in\n\nMattson III recognized this, and we determined that “[i]t may be necessary in a future case—\n\nwhere the issue is properly briefed and argued, and the choice of one standard over the other\n\nis dispositive of the commonality inquiry—to decide whether Montana will retain its more\n                                              18\n\fpermissive approach or instead adopt the Wal-Mart majority’s approach.” Mattson III, ¶ 37.\n\nThis, however, is not that future case. Neither Jacobsen’s nor Allstate’s arguments hinge on\n\nthe potential differences between Wal-Mart’s and Montana’s approaches to commonality.\n\nMoreover, the District Court applied Wal-Mart in its order certifying the class. Because we\n\naffirm the District Court’s certification of the class decision under Wal-Mart, the choice of\n\none standard over the other is not dispositive. We therefore need not decide whether\n\nMontana will retain its approach to commonality or how these approaches differ, and we will\n\nproceed with a discussion of Jacobsen’s proposed class in the context of Wal-Mart.\n\n                     a. Wal-Mart and F. R. Civ. P. 23(a)\n\n¶34    In Wal-Mart, the U.S. Supreme Court considered a proposed class of 1.5 million\n\ncurrent and former female Wal-Mart employees “who [alleged] that the company\n\ndiscriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or\n\npromotions ....” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2547.3 There, as here, the Court dealt with the\n\nrequirements of the identical Federal Rule 23(a)(2).          To satisfy the commonality\n\nrequirement, the plaintiffs had proffered statistical evidence about pay and promotion\n\n\n       3\n          We must note that the unusual size of the Wal-Mart class presented unique\nchallenges that may make the case inapposite to the classes generally proposed in Montana.\nSee Mattson III, ¶ 20 (at least 3,000 class members); Pallister v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of\nMont., Inc., 2012 MT 198, ¶ 7, 366 Mont. 175, 285 P.3d 562 (3,000 class members);\nChipman, ¶ 46 (1,254 class members); Diaz, ¶ 31 (“hundreds” of class members); Gonzales\nv. Mont. Power Co., 2010 MT 117, ¶ 6, 356 Mont. 351, 233 P.3d 328 (117 class members);\nFerguson, ¶ 39 (“at least” 239 class members); McDonald, 261 Mont. at 400, 863 P.2d at\n1155 (35,360 individual class members). The unique need in Wal-Mart to find some sort of\ncommon contention that would bind 1.5 million disparate individuals prompted a level of\nskepticism towards class certification that would likely never arise in Montana.\n                                              19\n\fdisparities between genders, anecdotal reports of discrimination from female employees, and\n\nthe expert testimony of a sociologist. The District Court reviewed this evidence and certified\n\nthe proposed class. Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 222 F.R.D. 137, 145, 2004 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 11297 (N.D. Cal. 2004). In the course of its Rule 23(a) analysis, the District Court\n\nnoted that “the party seeking certification must provide certain facts sufficient to satisfy Rule\n\n23(a),” that “the\n\ncourt’s analysis [of Rule 23] must be rigorous,” and that “ ‘the class determination generally\n\ninvolves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the\n\nplaintiff’s cause of action.’ ” Dukes, 222 F.R.D. at 143-44. Wal-Mart opposed the\n\ncommonality finding largely by advancing the unique nature of individual stores and its\n\npractice of giving local managers substantial discretion in pay and promotion decisions.\n\nDukes, 222 F.R.D. at 151.\n\n¶35    Wal-Mart appealed the class certification, contesting, inter alia, the District Court’s\n\nconclusion that the class met the commonality requirement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed after\n\ngranting a re-hearing en banc. See Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d 571 (9th Cir.\n\n2010). Wal-Mart again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari, issuing its\n\nopinion in 2011. The majority considered the decision on commonality to be the “crux” of\n\nthe case and engaged in an analysis of Federal Rule 23(a)(2)’s requirements. The Court\n\nattempted to clarify the application of Rule 23(a)(2)’s language and establish the proper\n\nstandard of Rule 23(a)(2) adjudication. For our purposes, this clarification produced two\n\nimportant holdings, the first concerning the sufficiency of a plaintiff’s common contentions\n                                               20\n\fand the second regarding the proper, “rigorous” level of Rule 23(a) analysis. We will\n\nexamine these clarifications in turn.\n\n¶36    First, the majority cautioned that the language of the commonality rule is “easy to\n\nmisread, since ‘[a]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common\n\n‘questions.’ ” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (citation omitted). Thus, the majority sought to\n\nclarify what sort of common questions of law or fact satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). The majority\n\nemphasized that plaintiffs may not merely raise droves of superficial common questions\n\n(providing “Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart?” as an example). Instead, the\n\nplaintiffs’ common legal or factual contentions must “demonstrate that the class members\n\n‘have suffered the same injury’ ” by asserting a common contention “of such a nature that it\n\nis capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will\n\nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-\n\nMart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. 4 This emphasis logically flows from the Court’s prior justification\n\nof the class-action device’s departure from the usual rule of individual litigation: “permitting\n\nan issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion\n\nunder Rule 23.” Falcon, 457 U.S. at 155 (quoting Califano, 442 U.S. at 700-01).\n\n¶37    Second, the Supreme Court sought to clarify what it saw as an inconsistent, and\n\ninadequate, level of Rule 23(a) review in the lower federal courts. In doing so, the Wal-Mart\n\ndecision embraced what has been termed a “rigorous” form of Rule 23(a) analysis. A\n\n\n       4\n        It should be noted that the majority retained the permissive recognition that “for\npurposes of Rule 23(a)(2) ‘[e]ven a single [common] question’ will do.” Wal-Mart, 131\n                                            21\n\f“rigorous” level of Rule 23(a) analysis was previously adopted by a majority of the federal\n\nCircuit Courts, and the “more rigorous” approach adopted by the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\n\nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits requires district courts to make specific findings that each\n\nrequirement of Rule 23(a) has actually, not presumably, been met. Dukes, 603 F.3d at 583.\n\nThe Wal-Mart decision adopted the “more rigorous” approach, as district courts may certify\n\na class “only if” they are satisfied that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have actually been\n\nsatisfied. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. Further, in the course of making the required\n\ndetermination that Rule 23(a) has actually been satisfied, “ ‘sometimes it may be necessary\n\nfor the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification\n\nquestion.’ ” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160). Thus, to the\n\nWal-Mart majority, a proper “rigorous” Rule 23(a) analysis specifically requires that the\n\ndistrict court determine each requirement of Rule 23(a) has been actually met and allows, but\n\ndoes not require, the district court to probe beyond the pleadings and touch aspects of the\n\nmerits to make this determination. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.\n\n¶38    The Wal-Mart majority’s application of the clarified commonality requirement\n\nprovides some further insight into its Rule 23(a)(2) analysis. Because the plaintiffs’ class\n\naction alleged a company-wide policy of gender discrimination in violation of Title VII, the\n\nSupreme Court recognized that “proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with\n\nrespondents’ merits contentions that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of\n\ndiscrimination.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552. The majority viewed the size of the class\n\n\nS. Ct. at 2556.\n                                             22\n\fand disparate nature of Wal-Mart’s employment decisions as particular problems, and\n\ndetermined that “[w]ithout some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions\n\ntogether, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members’ claims for\n\nrelief will produce a common answer to the crucial questions why was I disfavored.” Wal-\n\nMart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552. To provide this glue, the majority required the plaintiffs to prove\n\nthat a company-wide policy existed. The majority accordingly reviewed the plaintiffs’\n\nproffered evidence and concluded that it could not prove that a company-wide policy existed.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553-57. Thus, the Supreme Court probed beyond the pleadings to\n\ndetermine a merits issue—whether Wal-Mart even had a company-wide pay or promotion\n\npolicy—to determine if the plaintiffs could present a common contention amenable to\n\nclasswide resolution. Unlike the present case, because the plaintiffs could not prove a\n\nuniform plan or policy, they could not present the question of whether they, and the proposed\n\nclass members, had suffered a common injury as a result.5\n\n\n        5\n           Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected the propriety of a merits inquiry at the class\ncertification stage for a Rule 23(b)(3) class. The case, Amgen Inc., et al. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and\nTrust Funds,133 S. Ct. 1184, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308 (2013), involved a securities fraud Rule 23(b)(3) class action.\n To prove securities fraud and recover damages under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a\nplaintiff must prove, inter alia, a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant. Matrixx\nInitiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 568 U.S. __, __, 131 S. Ct. 1309, 1317 (2011). Materiality is key in a § 10(b)\nclass action suit because it is an essential predicate for the fraud-on-the-market theory that supports the\npresumption of “classwide reliance on those misrepresentations and omissions through the information-\nprocessing mechanism of the market price.” Amgen, 568 U.S. at __, 133 S. Ct. at 1194. Without this\npresumption, the plaintiffs could not prove that the class as a whole relied on the misrepresentation and\npresent a common question suitable for Rule 23(b)(3). However, the Supreme Court held that proof that a\ndefendant’s misrepresentations or omissions materially affected their stock price was not required at the Rule\n23(b)(3) class certification stage. Amgen, 563 U.S. at __, 2013 LEXIS at 8. While Wal-Mart recognized that\ncourts may intrude on merits issues, like materiality, to certify a class, the Amgen majority held that Rule\n23(b)(3) “requires a showing that questions common to the class predominate, not that those questions will be\nanswered, on the merits, in favor of the class.” Amgen, 568 U.S. at __, 2013 LEXIS at 8. As the Amgen\ndecision emphasized, “the office of a Rule 23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case; rather, it\n                                                       23\n\f                          b.    Jacobsen’s Proposed Class and the District Court’s Rule\n                               23(a)(2) Decision\n\n¶39     Here, the District Court applied the Wal-Mart decision’s reasoning that the asserted\n\nclass claim must depend upon a common contention that will resolve an issue that is central\n\nto the validity of each member’s claim. In applying this standard, the District Court looked\n\nbeyond the allegations of Jacobsen’s pleadings to find: (1) that Jacobsen had produced\n\n“significant proof” that Allstate intentionally and systematically failed to disclose that\n\nrepresented claimants received settlements 2-3 times larger than unrepresented claimants; (2)\n\nthat Allstate developed the CCPR with the intent that it would reduce the net sum of\n\nunrepresented settlements; (3) that Allstate hid this profit motive by developing the facially\n\nneutral CCPR; (4) that Allstate consciously disregarded a high probability that the net effect\n\nof the CCPR would result in less than a full and fair settlement; and (5) that the CCPR\n\nprogram had resulted in “a substantial, objectively measurable reduction in the total amount\n\nof compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole . . . .” The Court\n\nconcluded that these factual showings united Jacobsen and the class member’s claims and\n\nsupported the following common questions of law and fact, asking whether:\n\n        (1) the Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment adjusting practices are a\n        common pattern and practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as\n        generally applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole;\n\nis to select the ‘metho[d]’ best suited to adjudication of the controversy ‘fairly and efficiently.’ ” Amgen, 568\nU.S. at __, 133 S. Ct. at 1191. Amgen accordingly supports our recognition that the focus of the class action\ndevice is the fair and efficient adjudication of common claims. Further, both Amgen and Wal-Mart dealt with\nquestions concerning what sort of merits inquiry was appropriate. The Amgen decision limited merits\ninquiries in the context of a Rule 23(b)(3) securities fraud claim, supporting the view that Wal-Mart’s more-\nskeptical level of Rule 23 analysis is not universally applicable.\n                                                      24\n\f       (2) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana\n       caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum\n       economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between\n\n       Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of [sic] as a whole; and6\n\n       (3) Allstate has consciously disregarded a high probability that the net effect\n       of its Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment practices would result in net\n       settlement payouts to the class as a whole less than the net amount previously\n       sufficient to fully and fair[ly] settle unrepresented claims under Montana law.\n\nDespite potential factual disputes, the Court determined that Jacobsen’s proposed class\n\naction would provide the sort of “common answers” concerning the CCPR program that\n\nWal-Mart encouraged. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. Indeed, because the presence of a\n\ncommon pattern and practice is undisputed, Jacobsen’s common contentions do not suffer\n\nfrom the same defect as did the plaintiffs’ contentions in Wal-Mart.\n\n¶40    On appeal, Allstate first argues that because Jacobsen’s claim is not predicated upon\n\nan assertion that his third-party bodily injury or property damage claims were ultimately\n\nsettled unfairly or underpaid, there is no commonality between his claim and the alleged\n\nclass claims. However, this argument misses the thrust of Jacobsen’s class claim on remand.\n\nWhile Jacobsen’s requested relief and alleged bases for damages are not entirely clear, the\n\nDistrict Court determined that his claim asserts, in part, that Allstate’s application of the\n\nCCPR to unrepresented claims is a per se violation of the UTPA and results in actual harm in\n\n\n       6\n          As discussed below, however, we believe it is necessary to revise the second\ncertified class claim in light of our holding reversing the certification of a class-wide\npunitive damages award.\n                                               25\n\fthe form of an alleged zero-sum economic plan systematically reducing claims payments to\n\nincrease profits. This contention does not merely allege that the proposed class members\n\nsuffered a violation of the same provision of law “in many ways.” See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct.\n\nat 2551. Here, the presence of a “general business practice,” the CCPR, is undisputed.\n\nWhether this general practice, as applied to unrepresented claimants, violates §§ 33-18-\n\n201(1) or (6), MCA, is just the sort of question that may efficiently drive the resolution of\n\nthe litigation. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (commonality requires the plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate that the class members “have suffered the same injury.”). This determination\n\nwould not turn on the countless discretionary decisions that troubled the Wal-Mart majority,\n\nand would not be hampered by a variety of unique defenses and circumstances. Jacobsen’s\n\nassertion that the CCPR, as applied to the class members, represents a per se violation of the\n\nUTPA would resolve a necessary, central question applicable to all class members.\n\n¶41     Judge Richard Posner’s treatment of the Rule 23(b)(2) class certification at issue in\n\nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 672 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 2012)\n\nsupports this conclusion. There, plaintiffs filed a class action suit alleging that Merrill Lynch\n\nengaged in a system of racial discrimination by utilizing a company policy that allowed\n\nbrokers to form teams and that then rewarded team performance with increased broker\n\naccount distributions. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483, 489-90.7 The plaintiffs asked that the\n\n\n        7\n         Essentially, the plaintiffs contended that the teams were “little fraternities” that, intentionally or not,\nchose members largely from similar racial groups. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 489. Brokers did not have to\njoin teams, but being accepted by a successful team generally increased performance. Account distributions\nwere made when a broker left Merrill Lynch to distribute his clients’ accounts and they were based on the past\nsuccess of the brokers. Thus, if a broker wasn’t selected by a successful team, he may miss out on future\n                                                        26\n\fclass be certified to determine whether the defendant had engaged in discriminatory practices\n\nand to provide injunctive relief. The plaintiffs also wanted compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483. The district court denied class certification and the\n\nplaintiffs appealed. On appeal, Judge Posner considered the denied certification in the\n\ncontext of Wal-Mart. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 488. Judge Posner found that, unlike the\n\nWal-Mart plaintiffs, Merrill Lynch’s policies were an employment decision by the top\n\nmanagement that was appropriate for a class-wide determination as to whether the\n\nchallenged policies had a disparate racial impact. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 489.\n\n¶42     Judge Posner reversed the district court’s denial of class certification despite his\n\nrecognition that a final resolution of the class’s claims would require hundreds of separate\n\ntrials to determine compensatory and punitive damages. As Judge Posner noted,\n\n        [o]bviously a single proceeding, while it might result in an injunction, could\n        not resolve class members’ claims. Each class member would have to prove\n        that his compensation had been adversely affected by the corporate policies,\n        and by how much. So should the claim of disparate impact prevail in the\n        class-wide proceeding, hundreds of separate trials may be necessary to\n        determine which class members were actually adversely affected by one or\n        both of the practices and if so what loss he sustained—and remember that the\n        class has 700 members. But at least it wouldn’t be necessary in each of those\n        trials to determine whether the challenged practices were unlawful.\n\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 490-91 (emphasis added). To Judge Posner, “[t]he kicker is\n\nwhether ‘the accuracy of the resolution’ would be ‘unlikely to be enhanced by repeated\n\n\n\naccount distributions, which would cause him to not be selected by the successful teams, and a vicious cycle\ncould ensue. The plaintiffs argued that minority brokers at Merrill Lynch found it hard to join good teams\n“and as a result don’t generate as much revenue or attract and retain as many clients as white brokers do.”\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 490.\n                                                    27\n\fproceedings.’ ” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491. As the Seventh Circuit previously said in\n\nMejdrech v. Met-Coil Systems Corp., 319 F.3d 910 (7th Cir. 2003),\n\n       If there are genuinely common issues, issues identical across all the claimants,\n       issues moreover the accuracy of the resolution of which is unlikely to be\n       enhanced by repeated proceedings, then it makes good sense, especially when\n       the class is large, to resolve those issues in one fell swoop while leaving the\n       remaining, claimant-specific issues to individual follow-on proceedings.\n\nMejdrech, 319 F.3d at 911. A single class trial for injunctive relief that determines the\n\nlegality of a commonly applied procedure or policy is not only economical and attractive,\n\nbut, in the alternative, “[t]here isn’t any feasible method . . . for withholding injunctive relief\n\nuntil a series of separate injunctive actions has yielded a consensus for or against the\n\nplaintiffs.” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491; see also Wal-Mart, 131 S.Ct at 2557 (“[T]he key\n\nto the (b)(2) class is the, indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy\n\nwarranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful\n\nonly as to all of the class members or as to none of them,”).\n\n¶43    Regarding the class’s requested monetary relief, Judge Posner recognized “there may\n\nbe no common issues,” and determined “in that event the next stage of the litigation, should\n\nthe class-wide issue be resolved in favor of the plaintiffs, will be hundreds of separate suits\n\nfor backpay (or conceivably for compensatory damages and even punitive damages as well .\n\n. . .).” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 492. The Court approved of this bifurcated approach,\n\ndetermining declaratory and injunctive relief in a class trial and individual monetary relief in\n\nlater individual trials, because “the lawsuits will be more complex if, until issue or claim\n\npreclusion sets in, the question whether Merrill Lynch has violated the antidiscrimination\n                                                28\n\fstatutes must be determined anew in each case.” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 492. As the D.C.\n\nCircuit recently noted, “[t]he pututative [sic] class in McReynolds was appropriate post-Wal-\n\nMart because the economic harm alleged by each class member was the result of the same\n\ncorporate-wide policies and if the policies were held unlawful then a question central to the\n\nvalidity of each class member’s claim would be resolved in one stroke.” DL v. District of\n\nColumbia, 713 F.3d 120, __, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 7375, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This\n\nrecognition aligns with the Wal-Mart majority’s interest in certifying classes that will drive\n\nthe resolution of litigation and it supports affirming the certification of Jacobsen’s class to\n\ndetermine the certified declaratory and injunctive relief. See Ferguson, ¶ 28 (finding a\n\ncommon fact issue existed concerning whether Safeco programmatically breached insured’s\n\nmade whole rights); McDonald, 261 Mont. at 401 (concluding that commonality was\n\nsatisfied, despite class members living in different areas with different water sources,\n\nbecause the common theory was that the defendant breached a duty owed to all class\n\nmembers); M. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (“When appropriate, an action may be brought or\n\nmaintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.”); see also Williams v. Mohawk\n\nIndus., 568 F.3d 1350, 1360 (11th Cir. 2009) (“ ‘Since in theory there should be no hard\n\nrequirement that (b)(2) be mutually exclusive, and since subpart (c)(4)(A) allows an action to\n\nbe maintained ‘with respect to particular issues,’ the fact that damages are sought as well as\n\nan injunction or declaratory relief should not be fatal to a request for a (b)(2) suit, as long as\n\nthe resulting hybrid case can be fairly and effectively managed.’ ”).\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\f¶44    Indeed, federal courts applying Wal-Mart’s commonality analysis have focused on the\n\npresence of just this sort of common contention alleging that a defendant’s programmatic\n\nconduct violates the law. See DL, 713 F.3d at 127 (vacating class certification after Wal-\n\nMart because “the district court identified no single or uniform policy or practices that\n\nbridges all [the putative class members’] claims.”); Wang v. Chinese Daily News, 709 F.3d\n\n829, 834 (9th Cir. 2013) (vacating and remanding class certification following Wal-Mart and\n\nrequiring that the plaintiff show “significant proof that [the defendant] operated under a\n\ngeneral policy of [violating California labor laws]” to satisfy commonality); Forte v. Wal-\n\nMart Stores, Inc., 2012 Dist. LEXIS 97435 5-6 (S.D. Tex.) (noting that if the lease\n\nagreement provision plaintiffs were contesting was a per se violation of the Texas Optometry\n\nAct, “commonality would be met.”); Khaliel v. Norton Health Care, Inc., 287 F.R.D. 511,\n\n517 (W.D. Ky. 2012) (affirming class certification post-Wal-Mart where “it is the\n\nappropriateness of that [employment benefit calculation] methodology that will be\n\ndetermined when the court reaches the merits of the case, and such a question is indeed\n\n‘capable of classwide resolution’. . . and does not turn on the validity of countless individual\n\ndiscretionary decisions.”); Kingsbury v. U.S. Greenfiber, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n94854, 18-19 (C.D. Ca.) (concluding Wal-Mart did not alter the Court’s decision to certify a\n\nclass based on common questions including whether a standard purchase agreement was\n\ndeceptive under California’s Unfair Competition Law); Creely v. HCR ManorCare, Inc.,\n\n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77170, 4-5 (N.D. Ohio) (reconsidering class certification in light of\n\nWal-Mart and concluding the concerns raised in Wal-Mart “simply do not exist here”\n                                              30\n\fbecause “the crux of this case is whether the company-wide policies, as implemented,\n\nviolated Plaintiffs’ statutory rights.”).\n\n¶45    Allstate also asserts that the common questions identified by the District Court do not\n\ndemonstrate that the proposed class members have all “suffered the same injury.” See Wal-\n\nMart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. Allstate specifically argues that the first proposed common\n\nquestion—whether the CCPR as applied to unrepresented claimants violates the UTPA—“is\n\nprecisely the type of generalized question that Wal-Mart identified as insufficient.”\n\nHowever, as discussed above, the determination of whether Allstate’s common application\n\nof the CCPR to the proposed class violated the UTPA is the sort of “common scheme of\n\ndeceptive conduct” that necessarily presents common questions of law and/or fact. See\n\nFerguson, ¶ 28; McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491.\n\n¶46    Allstate further contends that this question cannot be answered as a class question\n\nbecause an independent cause of action for a UTPA violation or common law bad faith\n\nrequires a showing of actual damages. Because Allstate argues a showing of actual damages\n\nwould require case-specific, individual inquiries, it asserts that the first common question\n\ncannot be answered for the class as a whole. However, as discussed above, individualized\n\ndamage inquiries generally do not preclude class certification. See Mattson III, ¶ 38 (citing\n\nMcDonald, 261 Mont. at 403-04). Damages claims may be determined in later individual\n\ntrials after a class trial has determined the availability of the requested injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491.\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\f¶47    Allstate argues the second proposed common question is deficient because whether\n\nAllstate’s profit increased while total compensation paid to the class decreased does not\n\nprovide a common answer demonstrating a violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) or (6), MCA.\n\nJacobsen responds that the second common question would answer whether the CCPR\n\ncaused indivisible “legal injury” to the class as a whole “through the use of a dishonest\n\nsystem, whether or not the monetary value of each settlement ultimately was unfair.” We\n\nagree that the second certified class claim question is deficient, but only insofar as it conflicts\n\nwith our conclusion that the Court’s certification of a class-wide punitive damages award\n\nwas improper. As framed by the District Court, the second class claim asks the class jury to\n\ndetermine whether Allstate’s systematic use of the CCPR caused indivisible harm to the\n\nclass as a whole by operation of a zero-sum economic theory and an inversely proportional\n\nrelationship between Allstate profits and compensation paid to unrepresented claimants. The\n\nCourt formulated this claim so as to justify the entry of a class-wide punitive damages award.\n\nWe believe that the second certified class claim must be revised in light of our conclusion\n\nthat punitive damages must be determined on an individualized basis, to be awarded only if\n\nthe claimant can demonstrate compensatory loss. We consequently modify the second\n\ncertified claim as follows:\n\n       (B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana\n       resulted in damages to the members of the class by operation of its zero-sum\n       economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between\n       Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; and [. .\n       .]\n\n\n                                                32\n\fSee Section 3-2-204, MCA (entitling us to “affirm, reverse, or modify any judgment or order\n\nappealed from[.]”). The District Court considered the second common contention as\n\nproposing whether the CCPR’s alleged pursuit of profits at the expense of unrepresented\n\nclaimants harmed the class by potentially violating the unrepresented claimants’ rights to\n\ngood faith adjusting of their claims under the UTPA. Answering this question, as revised,\n\nwould presumably help determine whether the CCPR was an intentional, programmatic\n\neffort to produce unfair settlements in violation of the UTPA. While an increase in profits\n\nconcurrent with a decrease in total payments to the class as a whole may not prove a\n\nviolation of the UTPA by itself, the District Court did determine that significant proof\n\nexisted that Allstate developed the CCPR program “with the knowledge and intent” that its\n\nimplementation would reduce the net sum of unrepresented settlements. This revised inquiry\n\nwould help advance the determination of the legality of the CCPR while avoiding our\n\nconcerns with a class-wide award of punitive damages, as discussed below.\n\n¶48    The third common contention asks whether Allstate consciously disregarded a high\n\nprobability that the net effect of the CCPR would result in decreased settlements to the class\n\nas whole. Thus, an affirmative answer to the second question, determining that the CCPR\n\nwas an intentional effort to engage in unfair settlement practices to increase profits, would\n\nlikely advance the resolution of the third question and could support a finding of actual\n\nmalice pursuant to § 27-1-221(2), MCA. However, Allstate claims that the third common\n\nquestion is deficient because Jacobsen does not assert his claim was underpaid. Jacobsen\n\nresponds that the harm at issue is insufficient class-wide settlement payouts due to the\n                                             33\n\fCCPR’s zero-sum economic focus. Because Jacobsen argues that Allstate implemented the\n\nCCPR with the intention of implementing a zero-sum economic game to systematically\n\nproduce unfair settlements and increase profits, this contention would resolve an issue\n\ncentral to each class member’s claim: whether Allstate acted maliciously by applying the\n\nCCPR with the intent of lowering payouts to increase profits.\n\n¶49    It is important to note that district courts have “broad power and discretion vested in\n\nthem by” Rule 23 “with respect to matters involving the certification and management of\n\npotentially cumbersome or frivolous class actions.” Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330,\n\n345, 99 S. Ct. 2326 (1979); accord Sieglock, ¶ 8 (“Trial courts have the broadest discretion\n\nwhen deciding whether to certify a class.”). Here, class-wide resolution of the proposed\n\ncommon contentions “will drive the resolution of the litigation.” Chipman, ¶ 52. Such\n\npotentially illuminating questions are the focus of Rule 23(a)(2) and, as discussed above,\n\nresolving whether the CCPR violates the UTPA would set the stage for later individual trials.\n\nMoreover, as we require, the District Court examined the evidence behind the pleadings to\n\ndetermine that the proposed class actually satisfied the commonality prerequisite. We\n\ntherefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by determining that\n\nJacobsen’s common contentions, as construed by this Court, satisfy the commonality\n\nrequirements of Rule 23(a)(2).\n\n¶50    Again, both Jacobsen and Allstate have claimed that Wal-Mart presents a heightened\n\ncommonality standard when compared with our previous conception of the rule, and both\n\napplied Wal-Mart to the case on appeal. Because of this, and because we affirm the District\n                                             34\n\fCourt’s class certification (also based on Wal-Mart), we need not address whether Wal-Mart\n\npresents a different standard and if we intend to adopt it. Mattson III, ¶ 37. Instead, as we\n\ndid in Chipman and Mattson III, we simply conclude that Jacobsen satisfies the Wal-Mart\n\ncommonality standard because the certified class claims depend upon a common contention\n\nconcerning a programmatic course of conduct that is “of such a nature that it is capable of\n\nclasswide resolution,” i.e., that “determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that\n\nis central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at\n\n2551.\n\n               iii. Typicality—Rule 23(a)(3)\n\n¶51     Regarding typicality, we have previously explained that this requirement “is designed\n\nto ensure that the interests of the named representative are aligned with the interests of the\n\nclass members, the rationale being that a named plaintiff who vigorously pursues his or her\n\nown interests will necessarily advance the interests of the class.” Mattson III, ¶ 21 (citing\n\nChipman, ¶ 53). Thus, “ ‘[t]he premise of the typicality requirement is simply stated: as goes\n\nthe claim of the named plaintiff, so go the claims of the class.’ ” Arlington Video Prods. v.\n\nFifth Third Bancorp, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 3355, 42 (6th Cir. 2013). The commonality\n\nand typicality requirements “tends to merge,” Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, at 158 n. 13, and\n\ntypicality generally “prevents plaintiffs from bringing a class action against defendants with\n\nwhom they have not had any dealings.” Diaz, ¶ 35. Typicality is not a demanding\n\nrequirement, and it “is met if the named plaintiff’s claim ‘stems from the same event,\n\npractice, or course of conduct that forms the basis of the class claims and is based upon the\n                                                35\n\fsame legal or remedial theory.’ ” Diaz, ¶ 35 (quoting McDonald, 261 Mont. at 402). The\n\nunderlying event, practice, or course of conduct “need not be identical.” Diaz, ¶ 35. In\n\naddition, because Wal-Mart’s discussion of Rule 23(a) hinged on an analysis of\n\ncommonality, the opinion did not consider the requirements of typicality and did not purport\n\nto establish a heightened level of review.\n\n¶52    The District Court found that the nature of Jacobsen’s claim was typical of those of\n\nthe proposed class because “significant proof [exists] that Allstate subjected the class as a\n\nwhole, including but not limited to Plaintiff, to the same systematic violation of §§ 33-18-\n\n201(1) and (6), MCA, through the pattern and practice of the Casualty CCPR’s\n\nunrepresented segment adjusting practices.” Specifically, the Court found that: Jacobsen\n\nand each proposed class member are members of the above-defined class; Jacobsen and each\n\nclass member were at a minimum subjected to the same allegedly unlawful conduct\n\ngenerally; and the allegedly unlawful conduct caused harm to the class as a whole by\n\noperation of the CCPR and its alleged zero-sum economic theory. Thus, as required by our\n\nopinion in Mattson II, the District Court probed behind the pleadings to actually determine\n\nwhether Jacobsen met the typicality prerequisite.\n\n¶53    On appeal, Allstate argues that the District Court erred because “Jacobsen is not even\n\na member of the class.” Allstate supports this contention by claiming that Jacobsen lacks\n\nindividual standing because his initial release, obtained after his claim was adjusted to an\n\nunrepresented settlement pursuant to the CCPR, was rescinded, citing Hop v. Safeco Ins. Co.,\n\n2011 MT 215, 361 Mont. 510, 261 P.3d 981. Allstate further attempts to distinguish\n                                             36\n\fJacobsen’s claim from those of the class members by arguing that he does not contend his\n\nproperty damage claim was improperly handled and that he only seeks damages due to\n\nalleged emotional distress. Jacobsen in turn claims that the application of the CCPR is a per\n\nse violation of the UTPA, that the application of the CCPR to the class as a whole resulted in\n\nsystemic economic injury, and that both he and the class suffered emotional distress from the\n\napplication of the CCPR to their claims. Jacobsen essentially asserts that typicality isn’t\n\ndestroyed if class members display some uniqueness in the character of their individual\n\ninjuries.\n\n¶54      First, our opinion in Hop can be distinguished. There, we declined to find typicality\n\nbased on the named representative’s lack of individual standing for failing to meet the\n\nprocedural requirements of § 33-18-242(6), MCA. Hop, ¶ 20. The named representative did\n\nnot lack individual standing because of any factual differences in the substantive details of\n\nhis claim, but for bringing a claim under § 33-18-201, MCA, despite the absence of any\n\njudgment in, or settlement of, his underlying claim as required by § 33-18-242(6), MCA.\n\nThis holding is therefore inapplicable to Allstate’s argument that Jacobsen’s claim is not\n\ntypical because of the specific facts of the application of the CCPR to his unrepresented\n\nclaim.\n\n¶55      Second, Allstate’s arguments miss the aim of the typicality requirement by raising\n\nissues with the specific facts of Jacobsen’s claim and the specific relief he seeks. See Hanon\n\nv. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (1992) (“Typicality refers to the nature of the\n\nclaim or defense of the class representative, and not to the specific facts from which it arose\n                                              37\n\for the relief sought.”). Jacobsen is a member of the class as defined by the District Court.\n\nHe was an unrepresented third-party claimant bringing claims for property damage and\n\nbodily injury following a motor vehicle accident with an Allstate insured. Allstate applied\n\nthe CCPR to Jacobsen while he was unrepresented, and, at base, Jacobsen’s class claim\n\nalleges that Allstate systematically applies the CCPR to violate the rights of unrepresented\n\nclaimants under the UTPA. Jacobsen’s claim stems from the same course of conduct, the\n\napplication of the CCPR to unrepresented claimants, as the proposed class members’ claims\n\nand both Jacobsen’s and the class members’ claims are based on the same legal theory, that\n\nthis application of the CCPR violates the UTPA. The injuries that allegedly resulted among\n\nclass members, whether economic or emotional, are not sufficiently dissimilar to render\n\nJacobsen’s claim atypical of those of the class regarding this core allegation.\n\n¶56    Indeed, we have previously determined that the common application of an insurance\n\npractice to a proposed class constitutes an event, practice, or course of conduct sufficient to\n\nsatisfy the typicality requirement. See Diaz, ¶ 36; Ferguson, ¶¶ 26-28 (finding the related\n\ncommonality requirement satisfied by an allegedly programmatic breach of a duty). In\n\nChipman, we considered claims that the named plaintiffs’ claims were atypical from those of\n\nthe class in the context of a suit over the discontinuation of a sick leave buy-back program.\n\nChipman, ¶ 54. The defendant employers argued that the named plaintiffs’ claims were\n\natypical because they worked for the employers for a longer period and may or may not have\n\nattended a meeting with management. Chipman, ¶ 54. The plaintiff employees argued that\n\nthe class members’ disputes were typical because they were triggered by the same underlying\n                                              38\n\fcancellation of the buy-back program. Chipman, ¶ 54. We determined that because the\n\nclaims of the named plaintiffs and class members all arose from the same event, the plaintiffs\n\nwere able to establish “the necessary nexus between the injuries alleged by named Plaintiffs\n\nand class members.” Chipman, ¶ 56. We based this decision on an analysis of Cates v.\n\nCooper Tire & Rubber Co., 253 F.R.D. 422 (N.D. Ohio 2008). There, the named plaintiffs\n\nsought class certification in a suit against their employer over the imposition of a cap on\n\npost-retirement health benefits. Cates, 253 F.R.D. at 424. The district court determined that\n\ntypicality was satisfied despite the fact that the benefit plans of the named plaintiffs varied\n\nfrom those of the class members because all of the claims arose from the same event or\n\npractice and the class members relied on the same legal theory. Cates, 253 F.R.D. at 429.\n\nJacobsen’s and the class’s claims arise from the CCPR and all are proceeding under the legal\n\ntheory that the CCPR was implemented to lower claims payments to the class by violating\n\nthe rights afforded claimants under the UTPA.\n\n¶57    In addition, as we discuss below, our reformation of the requested class relief will\n\ncause the specifics of Jacobsen’s injuries to be aired in a later, individual suit for damages if\n\nthe court awards the requested class injunctive and declaratory relief. Jacobsen’s injunctive\n\nand declaratory claims arise from the same course of conduct as those of the putative class\n\nmembers, the application of the CCPR to his unrepresented claim for bodily injury and\n\nproperty damage following a motor vehicle incident. A class trial may efficiently, and\n\nappropriately, determine the legality of this program as applied to the class as a whole. See\n\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 490-91. Allstate’s concerns over Jacobsen’s typicality, centered on\n                                               39\n\fthe details of his injury and the availability of certain defenses, will be obviated if the\n\nspecifics of Jacobsen’s injuries will not be addressed in a class trial that considers only the\n\nproposed injunctive and declaratory relief. Thus, despite Allstate’s contentions, the specifics\n\nof Jacobsen’s alleged injuries do not render him atypical of the class because his claim\n\n“stems from the same event, practice, or course of conduct that forms the basis of the class\n\nclaims and is based upon the same legal or remedial theory,” McDonald, 261 Mont. at 402\n\n(quoting Jordan v. County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1321 (9th Cir. 1982) (emphasis in\n\noriginal). This satisfies the typicality requirement and we affirm the District Court’s\n\ndecision.\n\n               iv. Adequacy—Rule 23(a)(4)\n\n¶58    The fourth prerequisite of Rule 23(a) allows certification only where the\n\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. M. R. Civ.\n\nP. 23(a)(4).    “‘This requires that the named representative’s attorney be qualified,\n\nexperienced, and generally capable to conduct the litigation, and that the named\n\nrepresentative’s interests not be antagonistic to the interests of the class.’ ” McDonald, 261\n\nMont. at 403, 862 P.2d at 1156 (quoting Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1323). Adequacy is therefore\n\nclosely related to commonality and typicality. Regarding potential antagonistic interests, the\n\nDistrict Court determined that because Jacobsen’s asserted class claims satisfied the\n\ncommonality and typicality requirements, Allstate had failed to show a compelling reason\n\nwhy Jacobsen’s individual interests would conflict with the common interests of the class.\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\fThe court also took notice that Jacobsen’s class counsel are competent and experienced in\n\ncomplex class action litigation.\n\n¶59    Allstate argues that Jacobsen’s claims will be subject to unique defenses that are\n\nlikely to become the focus of any trial. However, “perfect symmetry of interest is not\n\nrequired and not every discrepancy among the interests of class members renders a putative\n\nclass action untenable.” Matamoros v. Starbucks Corp, 699 F.3d 129, 138 (1st Cir. 2012).\n\nWhen we apply this recognition to the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4), it is clear that\n\n“ ‘[o]nly conflicts that are fundamental to the suit and that go to the heart of the litigation\n\nprevent a plaintiff from meeting the Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy requirement.’ ” Matamoros,\n\n699 F.3d at 138 (quoting 1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 3:58 (5th ed.\n\n2012)). The potential intra-class conflicts that Allstate cites—which include Jacobsen’s\n\ndesire for an early settlement, that he may have initially decided to not hire an attorney, and\n\nthe cause of his emotional distress—are not “so substantial as to overbalance the common\n\ninterests of the class members as a whole.” Matamoros, 699 F.3d at 138. As a third party\n\nclaimant contesting the legality of the CCPR, Jacobsen has incentive to vigorously pursue\n\nthe requested injunctive and declaratory relief.    In view of this, the limited scope of the\n\nclass trial on remand, and the District Court’s considerable discretion in class certification\n\ndecisions, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that\n\nJacobsen’s interests are not antagonistic to those of the proposed class.\n\n¶60 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by certifying a M. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2) class action lawsuit?\n\n\n                                              41\n\f¶61    Once the Rule 23(a) prerequisites are satisfied, the analysis shifts to Rule 23(b).\n\nMattson III, ¶ 18. To be certified, a class must fit within one of the three types described in\n\nRule 23(b). Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2548-49. At the District Court, Jacobsen argued that his\n\nproposed class qualified under Rule 23(b)(2), or alternatively, as a “hybrid-type class”\n\ncombining elements of Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3). Rule 23(b)(2) allows a class action\n\nto be maintained if, having met the requirements of Rule 23(a), “the party opposing the class\n\nhas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final\n\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\n\nwhole[.]” M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). As the Wal-Mart decision noted, “[t]he key to the [Rule\n\n23](b)(2) class is, the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted--\n\nthe notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all\n\nof the class members or as to none of them,” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n¶62     Rule 23(b)(3) allows a class action if the court finds that the common questions of\n\nlaw or fact predominate over individual questions. The District Court declined to address\n\nJacobsen’s alternative claim for Rule 23(b)(3) relief because of the “cursory” briefing and\n\n“logical inconsistency” of a hybrid Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) class. Jacobsen does not\n\nchallenge this decision on appeal.\n\n¶63    The District Court specifically found that “significant proof” existed that Allstate, the\n\nparty opposing the class, had acted on grounds that generally applied to the class through its\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\fuse of the CCPR program.8 Following this determination, the Court examined whether\n\nJacobsen sought appropriate forms of injunctive and declaratory relief and whether\n\nJacobsen’s requested monetary relief was permissible under Rule 23(b)(2).\n\n\n\nAfter denying Jacobsen’s claims for equitable disgorgement and a vague prohibitive\n\ninjunction,9 the Court certified the following class action remedies under Rule 23(b)(2):\n\n       (A) declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of the\n       certified class claim [quoted at ¶ 16];\n\n       (B) mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:\n\n              (1) give all class members court-approved notice of the right and\n              opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment of their\n              individual claims by timely returning a proof of claim form;\n              (2) re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt of a\n              timely filed proof of claim;\n\n       (C) class-wide punitive damages pursuant to §§ 27-1-220 and 27-1-221(2),\n       MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-referenced class-wide conduct;\n       and\n\n\n\n       8\n          The District Court based this finding on its construction of Jacobsen’s class claim,\nwhich is quoted at ¶ 16, supra. The Court essentially determined that Jacobsen claimed that\nthe CCPR was a common practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as applied\nto the class as a whole, that the CCPR caused economic harm to the class as a whole, and\nthat Allstate consciously disregarded the high probability that the CCPR would result in\ninsufficient net settlement payouts.\n        9\n             The Court found that that a mandatory injunction compelling disgorgement of\nunlawful profits was not appropriate in addition to punitive damages and denied its\navailability as a Rule 23(b)(2) remedy. The Court also found that Jacobsen’s requested\nprohibitive injunction enjoining Allstate from engaging in unlawful conduct as found by the\njury was fatally vague because it failed to articulate a specific prohibition that would provide\nrelief to the class as a whole. Jacobsen does not appeal either decision.\n                                               43\n\f       (D) common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs upon a\n       class-wide punitive damages award[.]10\n\nAllstate generally contests the appropriateness of the certified class remedies as applied to\n\nboth the class and Allstate, and further asserts various violations of both its, and the class\n\nmembers’, right to due process.\n\n\n\n¶64    As we explain below, we affirm the Court’s certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class\n\nasserting the above class declaratory (“(A)”) and injunctive (“(B)”) relief, but we reverse the\n\ncertification of a potential class-wide punitive damages award (“(C)”). We accordingly\n\nremand with direction to determine the availability of the above declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief in a class trial. Further, instead of considering class-wide punitive damages, the class\n\ntrial will determine whether Allstate’s implementation of the CCPR involved either actual\n\nfraud or actual malice pursuant to § 27-1-221, MCA. See § 33-18-242(4), MCA; Lorang v.\n\nFortis Ins. Co., 2008 MT 252, ¶ 91, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. Thus, the class trial will\n\ninitially determine if the CCPR violates the UPTA according to the certified declaratory\n\nrelief. If so, the Court will issue a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to give all class\n\nmembers notice of the right to re-open and re-adjust their individual claims. Last, the class\n\ntrial will determine if Allstate engaged in actual fraud or actual malice in implementing the\n\nCCPR. If so, the trier of fact in the later individual cases may determine the amount of\n\n\n\n       10\n            Allstate does not challenge the certification of common fund attorney fees on\nappeal.\n                                              44\n\findividual punitive damages to be awarded if individual actual damages are also established.\n\nWe will discuss the certified class remedies in turn.\n\n       A. The Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n\n              i. Class Cohesiveness\n\n¶65    Allstate first argues that a Rule 23(b)(2) class is inappropriate because the class lacks\n\ncohesiveness. This is essentially a restatement of Allstate’s arguments against commonality\n\nand typicality. However, because a Rule 23(b)(2) class action is considered “mandatory,”\n\nsee Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558,11 a class that lacks homogeneity could unjustly bind absent\n\nclass members to a negative decision. See Barnes v. Am. Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 143\n\n(3d Cir. 1998). Because the relief sought must be able to affect the entire class at once, we\n\nwill examine the cohesiveness of the class in the context of a mandatory Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n\n¶66    Allstate claims the proposed class is inappropriate as a Rule 23(b)(2) class because it\n\n“would necessarily include many individuals who suffered no injury and thus could have no\n\nUTPA claim . . . .” Allstate claims both that these dissimilar class members would be\n\nunjustly bound by the action and that the lack of homogeneity would involve the\n\nadjudication of significant individual issues. However, these arguments are premised on a\n\nmisunderstanding of the nature of Jacobsen’s asserted class claims and are precluded by the\n\nscope of the class trial on remand. The individual context of any one settlement is not\n\nrelevant to the adjudication of the certified declaratory and injunctive relief and our\n\n\n       11\n         Rule 23(b)(2) classes are considered “mandatory” because the rule does not\nprovide an opportunity for class members to opt out and does not require a district court\n                                           45\n\freformation of the punitive damages portion of the certified relief removes the consideration\n\nof individual circumstances in the class trial. Thus, Allstate’s claim that not all class\n\nmembers have suffered actual harm or an unfair adjustment misses the point. The certified\n\nclass claims on remand are not intended to resolve individual cases of unfair settlement or\n\npayment. Instead, they are aimed at adjudicating the initial legality of the CCPR as applied to\n\nthe class. The later individual trials would allow Allstate to present evidence that individual\n\nclass members suffered no injury. But, the initial legality of the CCPR would not need to be\n\nre-litigated in each subsequent individual trial. See DL, 2013 U.S. App. at 22; McReynolds,\n\n672 F.3d at 491; Mejdrech, 319 F.3d at 911.\n\n¶67    As the District Court noted, our decision in Ferguson supports certifying Jacobsen’s\n\nrequested declaratory and injunctive relief as part of a Rule 23(b)(2) class. There, as part of\n\na Rule 23(b)(2) class, the plaintiff sought a declaration that the insurer, Safeco, had breached\n\nits adjustment duties through a “programmatic assertion of subrogation without first\n\ninvestigating and determining whether insureds had received their ‘made-whole’ rights.”\n\nFerguson, ¶ 33. Facing a similar claim that the requested declaratory relief would require\n\nthe adjudication of individual “made-whole” entitlements, we determined that the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim did not raise issues with Safeco’s application of the “made-whole” rule to any one\n\ninsured. Ferguson, ¶¶ 34, 39. Instead, we concluded that the plaintiff’s claim contested “the\n\nprocedures of a program of subrogation which systematically deprives all class members of\n\nany consideration of their ‘made-whole’ rights.” Ferguson, ¶ 34. Thus, like Jacobsen, the\n\n\nto afford them notice. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558.\n                                           46\n\fplaintiff in Ferguson sought a declaration requiring Safeco to follow a statutory duty prior to\n\nany consideration of the actual harm the violation of this standard caused to any individual\n\nclass member. These “class claims do not seek a determination of entitlements for each class\n\nmember and the payment of damages; rather [both] class claims seek a declaratory ruling\n\nthat will be enforced to compel [the insurer] to follow the legal standard . . . .” Ferguson, ¶\n\n34; see also Diaz, ¶ 47.\n\n¶68    Here, as in Ferguson, the plaintiff seeks “an order compelling [the insurer] to properly\n\nperform its statutory adjustment duties.” Ferguson, ¶ 36. Because Jacobsen presents a\n\ncommon question alleging a common injury, an answer will determine whether the CCPR\n\nwill be “enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of\n\nthem.” See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. The potential later individualized determinations\n\nof underpayment are not necessary to answer Jacobsen’s class claims and do not render the\n\nclass overbroad.\n\n              ii. Class Injunctive and Declaratory Relief is “Final”\n\n¶69    Allstate contends that Rule 23(b)(2) requires “final” relief, and contends the certified\n\nrelief is not final because “it only serves as a basis to present damage claims later.” Allstate\n\nlargely cites federal precedent as support for this proposition. However, we have never\n\nconstrued M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)’s use of “final” to impose a substantive obligation on\n\nplaintiffs, and it is not clear that Allstate’s citations to authority recommend that we do so.\n\nSee Richards v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 453 F.3d 525, 530 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“Subsection (b)(2)\n\nwas not intended to ‘extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively\n                                              47\n\for predominantly to monetary damages.’”). Moreover, Allstate’s preferred citations are\n\ndistinguishable from the present case. See Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 634\n\nF.3d 883 (7th Cir. 2011) (contesting the failure to implement a uniform program); Jamie S. v.\n\nMilwaukee Public Schools, 668 F.3d 481 (7th Cir. 2012) (finding proof of an illegal policy\n\nwas “entirely absent here.”). We have not recognized a substantive “finality” requirement in\n\nRule 23(b)(2) and we address Allstate’s complaints concerning monetary relief below.\n\n              iii. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief is not Amorphous\n\n¶70    As noted, Jacobsen seeks declaratory relief declaring the application of the CCPR to\n\nthe class to be a violation of the UTPA and a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to re-\n\nopen and re-adjust claims. Allstate complains that this relief “is so amorphous and vague\n\nthat it cannot support class certification,” citing Shook v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 543 F.3d\n\n597, 605 (10th Cir. 2008) and Kartman.\n\n¶71    Allstate specifically argues that the requested declaratory relief would provide an\n\ninappropriately abstract or advisory opinion that failed to provide further direction on the\n\nprocess to be used if claims are to be re-adjusted. However, our rule against issuing advisory\n\nopinions is based in the concept of justiciability. Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Reg’l Airport\n\nAuth. Bd., 2010 MT 26, ¶¶ 8-9, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. The various doctrines of\n\njusticiability seek to ensure that courts provide specific relief in concrete, actual\n\ncontroversies instead of opinions advising what the law or rule would be based upon a\n\nhypothetical set of facts or abstract proposition. Plan Helena, Inc., ¶ 9. This prohibition\n\ndoes not mean that the Court’s potential determination that the CCPR violates the law also\n                                             48\n\fneeds to be accompanied by a judicial proposal for a legal claims adjusting program. Our\n\nstatutory requirement that an order granting an injunction be specific in its terms, § 27-19-\n\n105(2), MCA, does not require this level of specificity either. See Guthrie v. Hardy, 2001\n\nMT 122, ¶¶ 61-62, 305 Mont. 367, 28 P.3d 467 (faulting an injunction which failed to\n\nindicate which named party carried the obligation of maintaining a road). Insurance\n\nadjusting is squarely within Allstate’s area of expertise, not the judicial branch’s, and where\n\nwe have previously faulted injunctions for a lack of specificity, we have not required the\n\nlevel of detail Allstate now requests.\n\n¶72    Allstate’s citations to authority do not support enlisting the judiciary to draft claims\n\nadjusting policies either. For example, in Shook, plaintiffs sought to certify a class\n\ncontaining all present and future mentally ill inmates in a Colorado jail. Shook, 543 F.3d at\n\n600. The plaintiffs sought a Rule 23(b)(2) class with declaratory and injunctive relief\n\naddressing jail conditions. However, the plaintiffs suffered from a wide variety of mental\n\nillnesses and were subjected to a correspondingly wide range of treatments by the jail staff.\n\nShook, 543 F.3d at 601. The plaintiffs sought a broad injunction “establishing standards\n\nacross a wide range of areas affecting mentally ill inmates,” touching upon staffing, training,\n\ninmate housing, safety, psychiatric care, and the proper use of force. Shook, 543 F.3d at 602.\n\nThe district court denied Rule 23(b)(2) certification because plaintiffs could not show that\n\nthe defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the whole class and because the\n\nvariety within the class precluded class-wide injunctive relief. Shook, 543 F.3d at 603. The\n\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the decision, noting that “the relief plaintiffs seek would require\n                                              49\n\fthe district court to craft an injunction that distinguishes—based on individual characteristics\n\nand circumstances—between how prison officials may treat class members[.]” Shook, 543\n\nF.3d at 605 (emphasis in original). Moreover, an injunction that took the opposite tack and\n\nmerely required “adequate” services would fail to describe just what, in light of the variety of\n\nthe inmates’ needs, must be done. Shook, 543 F.3d at 606. Shook therefore does not stand\n\nfor the proposition that Rule 23(b)(2) requires a certain specificity of injunctive relief, but for\n\nthe general recognition that Rule 23(b)(2) classes must be sufficiently cohesive so that the\n\ninjunctive relief applies to the class as a whole.\n\n¶73    In Kartman, plaintiffs brought a class claim alleging, in part, that State Farm’s failure\n\nto use a uniform, objective criteria while assessing their hail-damaged roofs amounted to\n\nbreach of contract, bad faith, and unjust enrichment. Kartman, 634 F.3d at 887. As relief,\n\nplaintiffs requested compensatory and punitive damages and an injunction requiring State\n\nFarm to reinspect all class members’ roofs pursuant to a uniform and objective standard.\n\nThe district court judge certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class to adjudicate the request for an\n\ninjunction and to assess State Farm’s liability. Kartman, 634 F.3d at 888. The appellate\n\ncourt reversed, finding that plaintiffs’ only cognizable injury was for underpayment of their\n\nclaims and that the requested injunctive relief was not the proper remedy. Kartman, 634\n\nF.3d at 889-90. This finding was largely based on the court’s conclusion that State Farm had\n\nno duty to use an objective, uniform standard to determine hail-damage. Kartman, 634 F.3d\n\nat 890. Thus, the plaintiffs’ failing was that the court determined State Farm had no duty to\n\nuse a particular method to evaluate hail-damage claims, let alone a duty to use the method\n                                                50\n\fthe plaintiffs sought to impose with an injunction. Kartman, 634 F.3d at 890. This situation\n\nis distinct from the present case, where Jacobsen seeks a declaration that Allstate’s CCPR\n\nviolates the UTPA and an injunction requiring notice to the class of the right to reopen their\n\nclaims. Jacobsen, unlike the plaintiffs in Kartman, is not contesting the lack of a program or\n\nseeking to outline the contours of a legal program to be imposed on Allstate.\n\n¶74    Unlike Shook and Kartman, the certified class at issue has been subjected to a\n\ncommon practice and has allegedly suffered a common injury to statutorily conferred rights.\n\nThis common contention, as discussed, is amenable to class-wide relief. This does not\n\nmean, however, that the court must go beyond an injunction addressing tortious conduct to\n\naffirmatively dictate proper adjusting practices. See Rodriguez v. Countrywide Home Loans,\n\nInc. (In re Rodriguez), 695 F.3d 360, 368-69 (5th Cir. 2012) (holding that injunctions are\n\nproblematic when they order a defendant to obey the law and do not indicate what law the\n\ndefendant needs to obey).\n\n       B. Punitive Damages in a Rule 23(b)(2) Claim\n\n¶75    The District Court certified the availability of class-wide punitive damages pursuant\n\nto § 27-1-220 and § 27-1-221(2), MCA. The District Court determined that monetary relief\n\nis available in a Rule 23(b)(2) class under Wal-Mart if it is incidental to the declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief, affords indivisible, non-individualized relief in a single stroke, and\n\ncomports with due process by not prejudicing the rights of the class members and defendant\n\nto contest specific cases. The Court also noted that punitive damages are generally not\n\navailable without a predicate award of compensatory damages, but reasoned that an award of\n                                              51\n\fpunitive damages based on actual malice does not require an award of compensatory\n\ndamages if the evidence shows that the predicate tort caused actual harm or damage. The\n\nCourt then determined that Jacobsen’s claim was capable of showing that Allstate’s alleged\n\nzero-sum economic theory visited a form of indivisible, actual economic harm upon the\n\nentire class, which it reasoned “would constitute a sufficient predicate for a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award in this case.” The Court further concluded that a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award did not implicate the due process concerns addressed in Wal-Mart\n\nbecause it was not an individualized monetary remedy and did not litigate any claim-specific\n\nissues.\n\n¶76       Allstate initially contests the basic appropriateness of monetary damages under Rule\n\n23(b)(2), claiming that “one possible reading” of Rule 23(b)(2) is that it does not authorize\n\ncertification of monetary claims at all. The majority opinion in Wal-Mart did not go so far as\n\nto foreclose the availability of monetary relief in Rule 23(b)(2) classes, however, and it left\n\nopen the possibility that incidental monetary claims could be certified under Rule 23(b)(2).\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. However, we need not decide the matter in this case, because\n\nwe reverse the District Court’s certification of a class-wide punitive damages award based on\n\nour concerns over the award’s potential effect on the due process rights of Allstate.\n\n                 i. The Class-Wide Punitive Damages and Due Process\n\n¶77       Allstate also claims that the District Court’s certification of class-wide punitive\n\ndamages violates Allstate’s right to due process because Allstate would be precluded from\n\nraising case-specific defenses to an individual class member’s entitlement to punitive\n                                               52\n\fdamages (e.g. that individual class member’s claims were handled appropriately or paid\n\nfairly). Conversely, Allstate argues that the potential class trial would “inappropriately\n\ndevolve into a series of mini-trials “if the Court were to allow Allstate to present defenses to\n\nclass member’s entitlement to punitive damages. Jacobsen counters that our decision in\n\nGonzales established that punitive damages class claims can be maintained for systematic\n\nwrongdoing without individualized proof of harm. Jacobsen also asserts that Allstate’s\n\nproffered federal precedent does not apply in the class action context.\n\n¶78    Given the nature of the requested relief as part of a Rule 23(b)(2) class, we agree that\n\nAllstate should be able to establish defenses to individual claims to ensure that punitive\n\ndamages are not awarded to claimants that were not actually damaged by the adjustment of\n\ntheir claims under the CCPR. See Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 353, 127 S.\n\nCt. 1057 (2007) (“[T]he Due Process Clause prohibits a State from punishing an individual\n\nwithout first providing that individual with ‘an opportunity to present every available\n\ndefense.’ ”); Seltzer v. Morton, 2007 MT 62, ¶ 145, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. It is true\n\nthat our Gonzales opinion considered the constitutionality of a class-wide punitive damages\n\naward. However, Gonzales did not consider a class-wide punitive damages award in the\n\ncontext of a Rule 23(b)(2) class and we did not consider the defendant’s right to present a\n\ndefense to each class member’s entitlement to a punitive damages award. Gonzales, ¶ 15.\n\nGonzales instead approved class-wide punitive damages in a combination Rule 23(b)(1) and\n\n(3) class suit where the district court certified a Rule 23(b)(3) compensatory damages class.\n\nGonzales, ¶¶ 17-19. Thus, the Gonzales class members’ entitlement to compensatory\n                                              53\n\fdamages would be established during the class trial and would support an award of punitive\n\ndamages. Here, adjudicating the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would not\n\ninvolve a similar determination of compensatory damages. Potentially granting class-wide\n\npunitive damages before determining whether individual class members suffered actual\n\ndamages, as Jacobsen suggests, raises serious concerns about fairness. See Jacobsen I, ¶ 67;\n\nStipe v. First Interstate Bank-Polson, 2008 MT 239, ¶ 23, 344 Mont. 435, 188 P.3d 1063.\n\n“Due process requires that there be an opportunity to present every available defense.”\n\nLindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 66, 92 S. Ct. 862 (1972). Permitting a class-wide recovery\n\nof punitive damages before sending notice to the class and determining the extent of the class\n\nmembers’ actual harm would allow the punitive award to be potentially based on non-injured\n\nparties. Allstate should be allowed to contest class members’ entitlement to punitive\n\ndamages. Philip Morris USA, 549 U.S. at 353-54. We accordingly conclude that the District\n\nCourt abused its discretion by certifying the requested class-wide punitive monetary relief.\n\n              ii. The Second Certified Class Claim\n\n¶79    Again, our conclusion that the Court abused its discretion by certifying a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award requires us to revise the second certified class claim. Our\n\nreformation of the second claim is discussed in paragraph 47, supra.\n\n\n\n\n                                             54\n\f¶80 3. Whether the District Court erred by holding that the Montana Rules of Evidence\ndo not apply to class action proceedings?\n\n¶81    Last, Allstate entered several objections before the District Court concerning the\n\nCourt’s consideration of what Allstate argued was inadmissible evidence during the\n\ncertification proceedings. In a footnote, the Court determined that the evidence Jacobsen\n\npresented in the Rule 23 certification proceedings did not need to be “in a trial-admissible\n\nform,” and denied Allstate’s objections to “the ultimate trial-admissible evidentiary\n\nsufficiency of Plaintiff’s preliminary Rule 23 factual showings in this case.”\n\n¶82    On appeal, Allstate maintains that the District Court erroneously based its class\n\ncertification order on evidence that “was clearly inadmissible under the Rules of Evidence.”\n\nAllstate argues this allegedly inadmissible evidence included opinions and statements in an\n\nexpert report, an article written by the Consumer Federation of America, an affidavit by one\n\nof Jacobsen’s attorneys, a power point presentation referred to as the “Liddy slides,” an\n\nincentive compensation plan, and affidavits and testimony from a New Mexico case that\n\nconsidered the CCPR. Jacobsen counters that his case “was grounded on dozens of\n\nMcKinsey documents” that Allstate produced on remand and that all other evidence was\n\nproperly considered. However, because the Court did not make a ruling on the admissibility\n\nof any of the evidence in question, the specific admissibility of a particular piece of evidence\n\nis not presented to this Court on appeal. Rather, we must consider the Court’s contention\n\nthat evidence need not be in a “trial admissible form” for the purposes of class certification\n\nproceedings.\n\n\n                                              55\n\f¶83    Allstate specifically contends that the District Court’s determination that “a rigorous\n\nRule 23 analysis” does not necessarily require a preliminary factual showing in “a trial-\n\nadmissible form” was error in light of our decision in Mattson II and the Montana Rules of\n\nEvidence. In Mattson II, the District Court refrained from engaging in an analysis of the\n\nmerits of the plaintiffs’ claims and stated it was required to take the plaintiffs’ allegations in\n\nsupport of the class action as true. Mattson II, ¶ 61. The District Court thereafter certified\n\nthe class. On appeal, the defendant argued that the court erred in its Rule 23 analysis by\n\ntaking the plaintiffs’ allegations as true and asserted that the court should have made its\n\ndetermination “based upon the evidence.” Mattson II, ¶ 62. We held that the court erred by\n\ndetermining it must take the plaintiffs’ allegations as true and noted a district court “certainly\n\nmay look past the pleadings” when determining if Rule 23’s requirements have been met.\n\nMattson II, ¶ 65. Quoting the Supreme Court’s decision in Falcon, we held “ ‘sometimes it\n\nmay be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the\n\ncertification question’ ” to determine actual conformance with Rule 23(a). Mattson II, ¶ 65\n\n(quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160, 102 S. Ct. at 2372). Therefore, while this “probe behind\n\nthe pleadings” may necessitate allowing discovery and hearing evidence, Mattson II also\n\ndetermined “there is no absolute requirement that a hearing be held” if “the paper record\n\nbefore the court” is adequate. Mattson II, ¶ 66. The applicability of the Montana Rules of\n\nEvidence was not addressed by this Court and was not a basis of our decision. Thus, despite\n\nAllstate’s argument to the contrary, Mattson II does not stand for the proposition that courts\n\nmust apply the Rules of Evidence in Rule 23 proceedings.\n                                               56\n\f¶84    Allstate also argues that the Montana Rules of Evidence require their application to\n\nRule 23 proceedings. In support, Allstate cites M. R. Evid. 101(a) and 104(a). Rule 101(a)\n\nstates that “[t]hese rules govern all proceedings in all courts in the state of Montana with the\n\nexceptions stated in this rule.” Rule 101(c) lists the situations in which the rules do not\n\napply, including preliminary questions of fact, grand juries, miscellaneous proceedings like\n\nthose for extradition or the issuance of warrants for arrest, “summary” proceedings, and other\n\nmiscellaneous proceedings like ex parte matters. Allstate contends that because the\n\nexceptions listed under Rule 101(c) do not include class certification proceedings, the rules\n\nmust apply. Rule 104 governs “[p]reliminary questions of admissibility” and Rule 104(a)\n\nspecifically covers “[q]uestions of admissibility generally.” While Rule 104(a) notes further\n\nsituations where the rules of evidence do not apply, it is not relevant to this case.\n\n¶85    In response, Jacobsen cites federal authority stating that courts in Rule 23 proceedings\n\n“may consider evidence that may not be admissible at trial.” Alonzo v. Maximus, Inc., 275\n\nF.R.D. 513, 519 (C.D. Cal. 2011); see also Fisher v. Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp, 238\n\nF.R.D. 273, 279 n. 7 (S.D. Ala. 2006) (“The Federal Rules of Evidence are not stringently\n\napplied at the class certification stage because of the preliminary nature of such\n\nproceedings.”). Indeed, federal courts do not generally require the application of the rules of\n\nevidence in class certification proceedings. See Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 603 F.3d\n\n571, 603 n. 22 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We are not convinced by the dissent’s argument that\n\nDaubert has exactly the same application at the class certification stage as it does to expert\n\ntestimony relevant at trial.”) (reversed on other grounds by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,\n                                              57\n\f131 S. Ct. 795 (2011)); Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp, 240 F.R.D. 627, 635 (N.D. Cal.\n\n2007) (“At this early stage, robust gatekeeping of expert evidence is not required; rather, the\n\ncourt should ask only if expert evidence is ‘useful in evaluating whether class certification\n\nrequirements have been met.’ ”); Kelly v. Montgomery Lynch & Assocs., 2007 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 93656, 3-4 (N.D. Ohio 2007) (“The Court declines to grant the Plaintiff’s motion to\n\nstrike, however, because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not strictly apply in evaluating a\n\nRule 23 motion for class certification.”); Bell v. Addus Healthcare, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 78950, 5-6 (W.D. Wash. 2007) (Thus, “Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23 does not require\n\nadmissible evidence in support of a motion for class certification and the Court will not\n\ncreate that standard.”).\n\n¶86    Importantly, the federal cases that hold that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not\n\nnecessarily apply to class certification proceedings do not base their decisions on an\n\napplication of F. R. Evid. 1101, which, like M. R. Evid. 101(c), enumerates the exceptions to\n\n\n\nthe general applicability of the rules of evidence.12 Instead, these federal courts based their\n\nconclusions on the requirements of the identical F. R. Civ. P. 23, and, as noted, we consider\n\nsuch federal precedent to be instructive. Specifically, these courts have determined that Rule\n\n\n       12\n          Like Montana Rule 101, Federal Rule 1101 specifically enumerates the situations\nin which the evidentiary rules do not apply. These situations are: preliminary questions of\nfact regarding admissibility under Rule 104(a), grand-jury proceedings, and miscellaneous\nproceedings like extradition or rendition, issuing a warrant or summons, sentencing, granting\nor revoking probation, or bail. Thus, just like the Montana Rules, the Federal Rules neither\naddress their applicability in class certification proceedings nor except the proceedings from\n                                                58\n\f23 does not require specific proceedings or trial admissible evidence because of the\n\npreliminary nature of class certification and trial courts’ broad discretion in certification\n\ndecisions. See e.g., Rhodes v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n46159, 37 (S.D. W. Va. 2008) (Rule 23 “does not specifically provide for, require, or\n\nprohibit specific proceedings,” including those that apply the Federal Rules of Evidence).\n\nIndeed, “class certification is not a dispositive motion [like Fed. R. Civ. P. 56] that requires\n\n[a] Plaintiff to submit admissible evidence” in support of their arguments for certification,\n\nand federal courts have been reluctant to create that requirement. Bell, 2007 U.S. Dist. at 5-\n\n6.\n\n¶87    Because of the preliminary, discretionary nature of class certification questions, every\n\nfederal circuit but the Seventh13 has declined to require that a district court must conclusively\n\ndecide what evidence may be ultimately admissible at trial during the class certification\n\nstage. See Cox v. Zurn Pex, Inc., 644 F.3d 604, 611 (8th Cir. 2011). “A court’s rulings on\n\nclass certification issues may evolve” through the course of discovery. Cox, 644 F. 3d at\n\n613. The “inherently tentative” nature of these decisions may make final evidentiary\n\ndecisions unnecessary or inappropriate. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469\n\nn.11, 98 S. Ct. 2454 (1978).\n\n\n\n\ntheir application.\n       13\n             The Seventh Circuit only requires a conclusive ruling on any challenge to an\nexpert’s qualifications or submissions when the expert’s report or testimony is “ ‘critical to\nclass certification.’ ” See e.g., Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d 802,\n812 (7th Cir. 2012).\n                                              59\n\f¶88     Importantly, the Wal-Mart decision did not dispose of the federal courts’ varying\n\napplication of the Federal Rules of Evidence to class certification proceedings. The Wal-\n\nMart Court considered the plaintiffs’ production of the testimony of Dr. William Bielby, a\n\nsociological expert, as the only proffered evidence of Wal-Mart’s alleged “general policy of\n\n[gender] discrimination.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553-54. The expert testified that Wal-\n\nMart’s corporate culture was “vulnerable” to gender bias, but he could not specifically\n\ndetermine how regularly gender stereotypes played a meaningful role in employment\n\ndecisions. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553. The parties disputed whether this testimony met\n\nthe standards for the admission of expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\n\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), and\n\nthe District Court concluded Daubert didn’t apply to class certification proceedings. The\n\nSupreme Court’s opinion did not squarely address this contention, merely offering “We\n\ndoubt” that “Daubert did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage” in dicta\n\nwhile concluding “even if properly considered, Bielby’s testimony does nothing to advance\n\nrespondent’s case.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2554. Thus, the Wal-Mart majority failed to\n\naddress the application of the Rules of Evidence to class action certification proceedings and\n\nthe Court’s doubt was aimed only at the application of Daubert, a question not presented\n\nhere.\n\n¶89     Because the District Court’s inquiry into a motion for class certification is tentative,\n\npreliminary, and limited to a determination of only whether the litigation may be conducted\n\non a class basis, “the court’s analysis is necessarily prospective and subject to change . . . and\n                                               60\n\fthere is bound to be some evidentiary uncertainty.” Cox, 644 F.3d at 613. A decision on a\n\nmotion to certify a class is not a conclusive judgment on the merits of the case, and is “not\n\naccompanied by the traditional rules and procedure applicable to civil trials.” Eisen, 417\n\nU.S. at 178, 94 S. Ct. at 2153. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err by\n\ndetermining that evidence considered for the purposes of class certification need not be in\n\ntrial admissible form.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n¶90    We accordingly conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ncertifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class action. We do, however, conclude that the certification of\n\nclass-wide punitive damages was inappropriate in the context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n\nAccording to our reformation of the requested relief, we remand for a class trial to determine\n\nwhether the application of the CCPR to the class violated the UTPA, and, if so, to determine\n\nwhether the District Court should enter an order requiring Allstate to provide notice to the\n\nclass members of their right to re-open and re-adjust their claims. The trier of fact in the\n\nclass trial will also make a determination as to whether Allstate’s implementation of the\n\nCCPR program involved actual fraud or actual malice, such as could justify the entry of\n\npunitive damages following a finding of actual damages in the ensuing individual cases. If\n\nthe trier of fact determines that Allstate did not engage in either actual fraud or actual malice,\n\nthe class members would be entitled to only the compensatory damages they can prove in the\n\nindividual cases. Following the class trial, the Court shall determine whether there should be\n\na common fund recovery of class-action attorney fees and costs.\n                                               61\n\f¶91    We also conclude that the District Court did not err in its determination that class\n\ncertification proceedings do not require evidence to be in “trial admissible” form.\n\n¶92    We affirm the class certification, but modify the class claim and the certified class\n\nrelief as herein set forth.\n\n\n                                                  /S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n\nWe concur:\n\n/S/ MIKE McGRATH\n/S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n/S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n_______________________\n\n\nJustice Beth Baker, dissenting.\n\n\n\n¶93    I agree that the District Court erred in certifying class-wide punitive damages relief\n\nunder M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The Court’s attempt to preserve the class certification order is\n\nflawed, however, because it still leaves in place a class claim that cannot meet the\n\nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(2).\n\n¶94    As a preliminary matter, regarding Rule 23(a), I disagree with the Court’s statement\n\nthat Wal-Mart has raised “dual questions” that require some future case for our clarification.\n\nOpinion, ¶¶ 32-33. First, no party in this case has disputed that Wal-Mart’s analysis of the\n\ncommonality element of Rule 23(a)(2) imposed a heightened threshold for class certification.\n\nSecond, counsel for both parties agreed during oral argument that Wal-Mart’s commonality\n\nanalysis established a different standard from that used in our prior cases. We already have\n\n                                             62\n\frecognized explicitly these points. Chipman, ¶ 47. Further, we did not state in Chipman, as\n\nthe Court implies (Opinion, ¶ 28 (citing Chipman, ¶ 43)), that Montana courts “are not\n\nrequired to march lockstep with federal interpretations of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.” While that\n\nstatement in the Court’s Opinion today is not untrue, we invoked in Chipman “this Court’s\n\nlong history of relying on federal jurisprudence when interpreting the class certification\n\nrequirements” and did not consider the standards we had applied “prior to Wal-Mart.”\n\nMattson III, ¶ 53 (Baker, J., dissenting) (quoting Chipman, ¶¶ 47, 52). By perpetuating\n\nconfusion over whether Wal-Mart changed the law—a point I do not believe is reasonably\n\nopen to dispute—the Court disserves prospective class plaintiffs and defendants, as well as\n\nthe district courts that seem to be called upon with increasing frequency to decide class\n\ncertification issues.\n\n¶95    Our October 2011 adoption of comprehensive amendments to the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, in fact, came in response to the recommendation of the Court’s Advisory\n\nCommission on the Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure to bring more uniformity\n\nbetween the Montana and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 23 of the Montana Rules\n\nis now identical in all substantive respects with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules, with two\n\nexceptions not applicable here.1 No party has argued that there is a legitimate basis in this\n\ncase for this Court to part company with its federal counterparts on the standard for\n\n1\n Montana’s Rule 23, unlike its federal counterpart, allows appeal of right from an order granting or\ndenying class action certification or an order finally and definitively rejecting a proposed class\nsettlement. Compare M. R. Civ. P. 23(f) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f). The federal rule also contains a\nprovision specific to referral of certain matters to a United States Magistrate Judge. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(h)(4).\n                                                 63\n\fcommonality. The Court should refrain from interjecting speculation that it may someday\n\nchoose to do so if the right case comes along. Since the Court in any event applies the Wal-\n\nMart commonality standard (Opinion, ¶ 50), its discussion on this point is not necessary.\n\n¶96     Even assuming that all four factors of Rule 23(a) are met in this case, there is\n\nnonetheless a serious flaw in the Court’s analysis of Rule 23(b)(2). 2 “Failure to establish\n\neach requisite element of Rule 23 is fatal to class certification.” Chipman, ¶ 43. The Court’s\n\ndismissal of Rule 23(b)(2)’s “finality” requirement not only departs from our consistent\n\nreliance on federal authorities regarding class certification, but fails to apply the language of\n\nour own rule. M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), identical to its federal counterpart, provides that if\n\nRule 23(a) is satisfied, a class action may be maintained if “the party opposing the class has\n\nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive\n\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]”\n\n(Emphasis added.) The Court summarily rejects Allstate’s arguments about the “final\n\ninjunctive relief” language by declaring that we “have not recognized a substantive ‘finality’\n\n\n\n\n2\n  I harbor reservations about whether Jacobsen meets the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4),\nsince he already has obtained the relief he seeks for the class—reopening and readjustment of an\nunrepresented claim. See Gary Plastic Packaging Corp. v. Merrill Lynch, 903 F.2d 176, 180 (2d\nCir. 1990) (unique defenses may preclude both 23(a)(3) typicality and 23(a)(4) adequacy of\nrepresentation) (citing 7A C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1764\nat 259-60 (2d ed. 1986) and 3B J. Moore & J. Kennedy, Moore’s Federal Practice para. 23.07[1] at\n23-192 (2d ed. 1987)). My concern is heightened by the Court’s determination that Jacobsen’s\nclaims satisfy typicality because “the specifics of [his] injuries [will] be aired in a later, individual\nsuit for damages if the court awards the requested class injunctive and declaratory relief.” Opinion,\n¶ 57. Since that concern relates primarily to the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), I do not further\ndiscuss typicality here.\n                                                   64\n\frequirement in Rule 23(b)(2)” and suggesting that the federal cases on which Allstate relies\n\nare “not clear” that we should do so. Opinion, ¶ 69.\n\n¶97    While this Court has not had occasion to consider the question, the history of the rule\n\nand the federal cases interpreting it leave little room for doubt as to the meaning of the\n\n“finality” requirement in Rule 23(b)(2). The Advisory Committee notes to subsection (b)(2)\n\nstate that it was intended to reach situations where “final relief of an injunctive nature or of a\n\ncorresponding declaratory nature, settling the legality of the behavior with respect to the\n\nclass as a whole, is appropriate.” This subsection of the rule does not, however, “extend to\n\ncases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money\n\ndamages.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 Advisory Committee Notes to 1966 Amendment.3 The\n\n“corresponding declaratory relief,” likewise,\n\n       should be equivalent to an injunction. . . . A request for a declaration that a\n       . . . statute is unconstitutional[, for example,] would qualify as “corresponding\n       declaratory relief” because the resulting judicial directive would have the\n       effect of “enjoining” the enforcement of the . . . statute. . . . On the other hand,\n       an action seeking a declaration concerning defendant’s conduct that appears\n       designed simply to lay the basis for a damage award rather than injunctive\n       relief would not qualify under Rule 23(b)(2). . . . Monetary relief that may be\n       deemed equitable in nature or ancillary to the declaratory relief may be\n       allowed, however.\n\n7AA C. Wright, A. Miller, M.

Ct. at\n2559-60.\n                                                  65\n\fon Class Actions § 4:31, 112-13 (“In short, declaratory relief under (b)(2) cannot simply turn\n\na (b)(3) damages action into an action under (b)(2).”).\n\n¶98    Actions for money damages are the province of Rule 23(b)(3), which imposes\n\nadditional requirements for notice and opt-out rights for the class members and requires\n\nfindings that a class action would be superior to individual litigation and that common\n\nquestions predominate over individual ones. See Mattson III, ¶ 19. “If recovery of damages\n\nis at the heart of the complaint, individual class members must have a chance to opt out of\n\nthe class and go it alone – or not at all – without being bound by the class judgment.”\n\nRichards, 453 F.3d at 530. “Thus, when the relief sought would simply serve as a\n\nfoundation for a damages award, . . . or when the requested injunctive or declaratory relief\n\nmerely attempts to reframe a damages claim, . . . the class may not be certified pursuant to\n\nRule 23(b)(2).” Richards, 453 F.3d at 530 (citations omitted); see also Jamie S. v.\n\nMilwaukee Pub.

The\n\nfirst certified class claim requires the District Court to declare whether the CCPR violates\n\nMontana’s unfair claims settlement practices laws. Opinion, ¶ 64. If the answer is “yes,” the\n\nDistrict Court is to “issue a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to give all class members\n\nnotice of the right to re-open and re-adjust their individual claims.” Then, if the class trial\n\ndetermines that Allstate engaged in fraudulent or malicious conduct, “the trier of fact in the\n\nlater individual cases may determine the amount of individual punitive damages to be\n\nawarded if individual actual damages are also established.” Opinion, ¶ 64 (emphases\n\nadded). The Court expressly acknowledges, as a basis for its commonality holding, that\n\n“resolving whether the CCPR violates the UTPA would set the stage for later individual\n                                              67\n\ftrials.” Opinion, ¶ 49. Thus, the decision today makes clear that the class trial is to occur for\n\nthe purpose of establishing a foundation for individualized damage awards. Simply stated,\n\nthis is not a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n\n¶100 The difficulty here is that the District Court already considered and denied, as part of\n\na comprehensive, sixty-page order prior to Jacobsen’s first appeal, his motion to certify a\n\nclass under M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Jacobsen did not appeal that ruling following its issuance\n\nin 2005 and would be barred from now challenging the District Court’s determination.\n\nBragg v. McLaughlin, 1999 MT 320, ¶ 21, 297 Mont. 282, 993 P.2d 662 (overruled on other\n\ngrounds, Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose’s Saloon, Inc., 2007 MT 202, ¶ 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166\n\nP.3d 451). Nor did Jacobsen cross-appeal the District Court’s refusal, in its January 30,\n\n2012, class certification order, to address his “fall-back Rule 23(b)(3) theory” because of the\n\n“cursory nature of Plaintiff’s briefing and logical inconsistency of this theory with his\n\nprimary Rule 23(b)(2) theory.” He similarly fails on appeal to develop his arguments or to\n\naddress the separate Rule 23(b)(3) requirements of predominance and superiority.\n\n¶101 In conclusion, because Jacobsen cannot establish all of the requirements of the rule, I\n\ndissent from the Court’s decision to uphold Rule 23(b)(2) class certification.\n\n\n\n                                                    /S/ BETH BAKER\n\n\nJustice Jim Rice joins in the dissenting Opinion of Justice Baker.\n\n\n                                                    /S/ JIM RICE\n                                               68\n\fJustice Laurie McKinnon, dissenting.\n\n¶102 I dissent from the Court’s decision. As explained below, the case the Court decides\n\ntoday is not the case that was presented to us. This class action, as argued by Jacobsen and\n\ncertified by the District Court, is one for declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act (Title 27, chapter 8, MCA). The class remedies are a declaratory judgment,\n\nan injunction, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. The injunction gives class members the\n\noption of returning to the position they were in when they initially filed their claims, i.e.,\n\nbefore Allstate applied the CCPR to them. This is not a class action to determine liability for\n\ndamages under the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA; Title 33, chapter 18, MCA).\n\nJacobsen did not frame the class claim pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) as one that would lead to\n\ncompensatory damages; to the contrary, he conceded from the outset that some of the\n\nputative class members may have suffered no individual harm from Allstate’s use of the\n\nCCPR. All he requested was an injunction “to prohibit Allstate from using its CCPR\n\nprogram, to re-open improperly settled claims, and for disgorgement of illicit profits from\n\nthe unlawful program.” The District Court, correspondingly, did not certify any claims or\n\nremedies under the UTPA.\n\n¶103 This Court, however, proceeds to repackage this case as a UTPA action. One facet of\n\nAllstate’s liability is to be decided in a class trial, after which further liability determinations\n\nand assessments of damages are to be made in ensuing individual trials. I disagree with this\n\n\n                                                69\n\fsua sponte reworking of the case. Aside from being improper appellate practice, the scheme\n\nthe Court has devised here distorts the rules for certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and\n\ninfringes class members’ due process rights.\n\n¶104 The ensuing discussion relates primarily to my disagreement with the Court’s\n\nremaking of the case and the Court’s approach to Rule 23(b)(2) certification. However, like\n\nJustice Baker, I also harbor reservations about whether the threshold requirements of Rule\n\n23(a) have been met. I address those concerns at the end of this Dissent.\n\n        I. The District Court’s Construction of the Class Claim and Remedies\n\n¶105 Jacobsen’s Fourth Amended Complaint is far from a model of clarity. In fact, the\n\nDistrict Court noted in its class-certification Order that there is “considerable pleading\n\nimprecision on [the] face” of the complaint. This Court, likewise, acknowledges that\n\n“Jacobsen’s requested relief and alleged bases for damages are not entirely clear.” Opinion,\n\n¶ 40.\n\n¶106 Faced with this pleading imprecision, the District Court liberally “construed”\n\nJacobsen’s Fourth Amended Complaint and his arguments supporting class certification so\n\nas to arrive at class claims and remedies that could “minimally” satisfy the criteria of Rule\n\n23. Jacobsen certainly benefitted from the District Court’s efforts in this regard, and it must\n\nbe noted that, just as he has not contested other aspects of the District Court’s decision (see\n\ne.g. Opinion, ¶ 62, ¶ 63 n. 9), Jacobsen also has not cross-appealed from the District Court’s\n\nultimate determination of the class claim and the class remedies.\n\n\n                                              70\n\f¶107 The District Court perceived both individual and class claims in the Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint. In identifying the class claim, the District Court found as follows:\n\n       Separate and apart from the individual claims asserted in this case, the court\n       construes the substantive essence of Plaintiff’s asserted class claim to be that,\n       irrespective of individual outcomes, the unrepresented segment adjustment\n       practices specified in Allstate’s CCPR Implementation Manual (Tort States)\n       (hereinafter Casualty CCPR) constitute a common pattern and practice in\n       violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class as\n       a whole, thereby resulting in indivisible harm to the class as a whole by\n       operation of Allstate’s own zero-sum economic theory and the resulting\n       inversely proportional relationship between Allstate’s profit increases and\n       corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class\n       of unrepresented claimants as a whole.\n\nA critical term in this construction of the class claim is “indivisible harm to the class as a\n\nwhole.” This language is important because, as explained below, it reflects the limited claim\n\nand remedies that the District Court had in mind, and because this Court’s revision of the\n\nDistrict Court’s language dramatically alters the nature of this case.\n\n¶108 Jacobsen requested class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). “ ‘The key to the\n\n[Rule 23](b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy\n\nwarranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful\n\nonly as to all of the class members or as to none of them.’ ” Diaz v. Blue Cross & Blue\n\nShield of Mont., 2011 MT 322, ¶ 42, 363 Mont. 151, 267 P.3d 756 (brackets in original)\n\n(quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2557 (2011)). As\n\nthe Supreme Court further explained:\n\n       In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or\n       declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It\n       does not authorize class certification when each individual class member\n                                              71\n\f       would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the\n       defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class\n       member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (emphasis in original).\n\n¶109 The District Court construed Jacobsen’s substantive arguments mindful of these\n\nprinciples, correctly recognizing that Rule 23(b)(2) requires an indivisible remedy and does\n\nnot permit class certification for purposes of individualized awards of monetary damages.\n\nThe court construed Jacobsen’s requested class relief under Rule 23(b)(2) to consist of “a\n\nclaim for class-wide declaratory, injunctive, and incidental monetary relief (equitable\n\ndisgorgement and punitive damages).” The District Court declined to certify the equitable\n\ndisgorgement remedy on the ground that it was cumulative to the injunctive relief, but the\n\ncourt otherwise certified the class relief Jacobsen sought. Specifically, the District Court\n\ncertified the following claim and remedies:\n\n       (2)    Class Action Claim. The certified class claim is that:\n\n              (A)    the Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment adjusting practices\n                     are a common pattern and practice in violation of\n                     §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class\n                     of unrepresented claimants as a whole;\n\n              (B)    Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in\n                     Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by\n                     operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting\n                     inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profit\n                     increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n                     compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a\n                     whole; and\n\n              (C)    Allstate acted with “actual malice,” as defined by § 27-1-221(2),\n                     MCA, by intentionally, deliberately, and consciously creating\n                                              72\n\f                     and disregarding a high probability that the net effect of its\n                     Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment practices would result\n                     in net settlement payouts to the class as a whole less than the net\n                     amount previously sufficient to fully and fair[ly] settle\n                     unrepresented claims under Montana law;\n\n       (3)    Class Action Remedies. The certified class remedies available as a\n              matter of law on proof of the certified class claim are:\n\n              (A)    declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of\n                     the certified class claim;\n\n              (B)    mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:\n\n                     (1)    give all class members court-approved notice of the right\n                            and opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment\n                            of their individual claims by timely returning a proof of\n                            claim form; and\n\n                     (2)    re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt\n                            of a timely filed proof of claim;\n\n              (C)    class-wide punitive damages pursuant to §§ 27-1-220 and\n                     27-1-221(2), MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-\n                     referenced class-wide conduct; and\n\n              (D)    common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs\n                     upon a class-wide punitive damages award[.]\n\n¶110 With respect to establishing the “indivisible harm” asserted in the Class Action Claim,\n\nthe District Court explained that\n\n       the occurrence and extent of the actual harm common to the class as a whole is\n       ascertainable and at least generally measurable on an indivisible class-wide\n       basis without consideration of individual outcomes by comparative analysis of\n       relevant industry performance data and internal Allstate performance data.\n\nJacobsen’s theory is that if Allstate outperformed industry norms (in terms of profits and\n\n\n                                             73\n\freduced payouts) due to the CCPR, then the class members were indivisibly harmed.1\n\n¶111 Accordingly, setting aside the punitive damages and the common fund recovery,2 the\n\nDistrict Court certified only two class remedies. The first remedy is a declaration that the\n\nCCPR constitutes a per se prohibited claim settlement practice under § 33-18-201(1) and (6),\n\nMCA.3 The class trial must determine, therefore, that applying the CCPR was unlawful as to\n\nall class members or, conversely, to no class members. In a sense, this is analogous to\n\ndeciding a facial challenge to a statute: to prevail on such a challenge, the plaintiff must\n\nshow that “no set of circumstances exists under which the [statute] would be valid, i.e., that\n\nthe law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.” Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State\n\nRepublican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 1190 (2008) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Caldwell v. MACo Workers’ Comp. Trust, 2011 MT 162, ¶ 69, 361 Mont.\n\n140, 256 P.3d 923 (Baker & Rice, JJ., dissenting). That is, in essence, what the certified\n\nclass claim asserts regarding the CCPR: that no set of circumstances exists under which the\n\nCCPR would be valid. The CCPR is unlawful in all of its applications—as the theory\n\ngoes—because the “attorney economics script” misrepresents facts and because the “fast\n\n\n        1\n          Jacobsen proffered several studies of Allstate’s performance. One such study—a 2007\nreport from the Consumer Federation of America—asserts that Allstate has been able “to outperform\nthe industry by 20 percent” due to the CCPR.\n        2\n          I agree with the Court that the certification of classwide punitive damages was\ninappropriate. Not only would such an award implicate due process, Opinion, ¶¶ 77-78, but the\nDistrict Court did not certify compensatory damages as a class remedy and, thus, there can be no\naward of classwide punitive damages, see Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2009 MT 248, ¶ 67, 351\nMont. 464, 215 P.3d 649.\n        3\n          “A person may not . . . (1) misrepresent pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions\nrelating to coverages at issue; . . . [or] (6) neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair,\nand equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear; . . . .” Section\n                                                   74\n\ftrack” system and the “9-step process” are inherently incompatible with good-faith\n\neffectuation of fair and equitable settlements. If the class prevails on this claim, then the\n\nsecond remedy the District Court certified is an injunction requiring Allstate to allow each\n\nclass member to return to square one, i.e., go back to the point when his or her claim was\n\nfirst filed, before Allstate applied the CCPR.\n\n¶112 Importantly, the District Court did not certify any class claim or remedies under the\n\nUTPA itself. The UTPA recognizes “an independent cause of action [by an insured or a\n\nthird-party claimant] against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer’s violation\n\nof subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201.” Section 33-18-242(1), MCA. In\n\nsuch action, “the court or jury may award such damages as were proximately caused by the\n\nviolation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201,” as well as “[e]xemplary\n\ndamages.” Section 33-18-242(4), MCA. That is not the nature of the class action certified\n\nby the District Court here. The parties’ arguments in the District Court, and the District\n\nCourt’s ensuing analysis in its Order, confirm this conclusion. They also provide insight into\n\nthe precise nature of the class claim, as follows.\n\n¶113 First, in his briefs supporting class certification, Jacobsen asserted that this case is\n\n“squarely governed” by Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 2008 MT 109, 342 Mont. 380,\n\n180 P.3d 1164. Of relevance, he quoted the following passage from that decision:\n\n             The challenge here is not to an error in Safeco’s application of the\n       “made-whole” rule to any given insured. Rather, this case challenges the\n       procedures of a program of subrogation which systematically deprives all class\n\n33-18-201, MCA.\n                                              75\n\f       members of any consideration of their “made-whole” rights. Thus, as\n       Ferguson points out in her brief on appeal, her class claims do not seek a\n       determination of entitlements for each class member and the payment of\n       damages; rather, her class claims seek a declaratory ruling that will be\n       enforced to compel Safeco to follow the legal standard in its subrogation\n       program.\n\nFerguson, ¶ 34. Jacobsen indicated that he was seeking the same sort of relief: a\n\ndeclaratory ruling that will be enforced to compel Allstate to stop using the CCPR. He\n\nfurther asserted that the “vehicle for class relief” under his Rule 23(b)(2) theory is an\n\ninjunction requiring Allstate either to re-open and re-adjust the claims, or to disgorge the\n\nprofits it made as a result of the CCPR. (As noted, the District Court chose the former.)\n\nJacobsen did not assert any entitlement to compensatory damages for class members.\n\n¶114 Second, in its brief seeking dismissal of the class claim, Allstate argued that Jacobsen\n\nhad compromised the interests of class members by not seeking compensatory damages on\n\ntheir behalf. In response, Jacobsen argued that he was not required to assert claims for\n\ncompensatory damages. He cited Lebrilla v. Farmers Group, Inc., 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 25 (Cal.\n\nApp. 4th Dist. 2004), for the proposition that there is no rule requiring a class representative\n\nto seek certification of all causes of action available to every member of the class. See\n\nLebrilla, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 40 (“Farmers is essentially asking us to hold a class cannot be\n\ncertified anytime the class representative fails to seek certification of fewer than all causes of\n\naction. Of course there is currently no such rule.”).\n\n¶115 Third, in its Order, the District Court recognized that there are “case-specific issues\n\npeculiar to individual claims” here. The court noted, for example, that whether liability for a\n\n                                               76\n\fgiven claim had become “reasonably clear,” see § 33-18-201(6), MCA, is “a highly\n\nindividualized, case-specific criteri[on].”4 The court noted the same thing with regard to\n\n“whether and to what extent individual class members ultimately received fair settlements.”\n\nThe existence of such factual variations among claimants subjected to the CCPR would\n\npreclude classwide adjudication of Allstate’s liability for damages under § 33-18-242(1),\n\nMCA. But the District Court did not construe this case as such an action. The court instead\n\nconstrued Jacobsen’s class claim to be that Allstate’s use of the CCPR violated\n\n§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, “irrespective of outcomes in individual cases.” The court\n\nobserved that “the class-wide matter at issue is the indivisible net effect of the Casualty\n\nCCPR unrepresented segment practices on the class as a whole, irrespective of individual\n\noutcomes.” Accordingly, setting aside the statute’s case-specific criteria, the District Court\n\nreasoned that “§§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, essentially require Allstate to promptly,\n\naccurately, truthfully, fairly, and in good faith adjust bodily injury and property damage\n\nclaims.” The court construed the class claim to be that Allstate’s use of the CCPR violates\n\nthese general principles of § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA.\n\n¶116 Fourth, the District Court recognized that Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize class\n\ncertification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of\n\nmonetary damages. The court thus framed “the dispositive Rule 23(b)(2) issues” as\n\n“(1) whether the asserted class claim seeks permissible forms of injunctive relief that will\n\n\n       4\n          Again, § 33-18-201(6), MCA, prohibits an insurer from “neglect[ing] to attempt in good\nfaith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become\n                                                77\n\fbenefit the class as a whole and (2) whether as a matter of law the requested forms of\n\nmonetary relief, however characterized, are permissible forms of Rule 23(b)(2) relief\n\nincidental to the predicate declaratory and injunctive relief from which they flow.” I discuss\n\nthe meaning of “incidental” monetary relief below. See ¶ 134, infra. For present purposes, it\n\nsuffices to note that it does not include individual claims for compensatory damages. The\n\nDistrict Court expressly rejected Allstate’s contention that the class action here would “serve\n\nonly to facilitate the award of damages.”\n\n¶117 Finally, consistent with the foregoing points, the District Court cited Title 27, chapter\n\n8, MCA (the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act), as authority for the first certified class\n\nremedy and Title 27, chapter 19, MCA (authorizing injunctions), as authority for the second\n\ncertified class remedy. The court did not rely on § 33-18-242, MCA, as authority for the\n\nclass claim or the class remedy. In fact, the District Court rejected the proposition that\n\nJacobsen’s class action is one that seeks “damages” under the UTPA:\n\n       Here, as construed by the court, Plaintiff’s asserted UTPA-based class claim\n       neither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages – it\n       merely encompasses first and third-party . . . claims for declaratory relief and\n       related equitable and punitive relief predicated on asserted class-wide\n       violations of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA.\n\nAllstate had pointed out in its brief opposing class certification that § 33-18-242, MCA,\n\nspecifically authorizes damages—compensatory and punitive—for an insurer’s violation of\n\nthe UTPA, not the equitable remedies that Jacobsen sought. See § 33-18-242(4), MCA.\n\nAllstate argued, therefore, that injunctive relief was not available to remedy the asserted\n\n\nreasonably clear.”\n                                              78\n\fclasswide violations of § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA. The District Court, however,\n\ninterpreted our decision in Ferguson as approving a class action “distinct from an\n\nindependent UTPA claim for damages under §§ 33-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.” The court\n\nconcluded that this case was such an action, i.e., “a UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action\n\nclaim for declaratory and derivative non-compensatory injunctive relief.”\n\n¶118 In sum, the District Court attempted to construe Jacobsen’s filings to assert a class\n\nclaim and class remedies that “minimally” satisfy the criteria of Rule 23(b)(2). The court\n\nrecognized that Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment\n\nwould provide relief to each member of the class, and that Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize\n\nclass certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of\n\nmonetary damages. Diaz, ¶ 42; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. Construing Jacobsen’s filings,\n\nthe District Court found that his “asserted UTPA-based class claim neither constitutes nor is\n\ntantamount to a claim for compensatory damages”; rather, what Jacobsen was asserting was\n\n“a UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action claim for declaratory and derivative non-\n\ncompensatory injunctive relief.” The District Court observed that this claim is “distinct from\n\nan independent UTPA claim for damages under §§ 33-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.”\n\n¶119 The class claim asserts what is in essence a facial challenge to the CCPR, alleging that\n\nthe CCPR is per se unlawful as to all unrepresented claimants and that Allstate’s use of the\n\nCCPR caused “indivisible harm to the class as a whole” as shown “by comparative analysis\n\nof relevant industry performance data and internal Allstate performance data.” Jacobsen\n\nexplained in the District Court that the claim “challenges Allstate’s systematic attempt to\n                                             79\n\fsettle claims below fair value.” In his view, “Allstate systematically promoted bad-faith\n\nadjusting and sought to undervalue claims.” Whether class members’ claims were, in fact,\n\nundervalued or settled unfairly is not the issue; the challenge is to Allstate’s alleged\n\n“systematic attempt” to settle claims below fair value. As Jacobsen further explains this\n\ntheory in his brief on appeal, Allstate used “settlement guidelines below the level needed to\n\nfairly compensate claimants” which caused class members “indivisible legal injury”; i.e.,\n\n“[a]ll members suffered legal injury through the use of a dishonest system, whether or not\n\nthe monetary value of each settlement ultimately was unfair.”\n\n¶120 Jacobsen and the District Court employ § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as the legal\n\nstandard for judging the CCPR’s validity, but without consideration of the case-specific\n\ncriteria contained in the statute (such as whether liability in a particular class member’s claim\n\nwas “reasonably clear”). Under this approach, the issues to be determined at the class trial\n\nare: whether the “attorney economics script” misrepresents facts; whether the “fast track”\n\nsystem and the “9-step process” are inherently incompatible with good-faith effectuation of\n\nprompt, fair, and equitable settlements; and whether use of these programs caused indivisible\n\nharm to the class as a whole. If using the CCPR enabled Allstate to outperform the industry,\n\nand if the CCPR is facially unlawful, then class members suffered an indivisible legal injury.\n\nThe proper remedy for this injury, the District Court determined, is injunctive relief\n\n“restoring interested class members and Allstate to the pre-settlement status quo.” This is\n\nthe class action that the District Court certified and that Allstate appealed to this Court.\n\n             II. This Court’s Remaking of the Class Claim and Remedies\n                                               80\n\f¶121 The Court, on its own initiative, fundamentally revises this framework. The Court\n\nbegins with the erroneous premise that the District Court formulated the class claim using the\n\n“indivisible harm to the class as a whole” language “so as to justify the entry of a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award.” Opinion, ¶ 47. That is simply incorrect. The District Court used\n\nthis language because indivisibility is what is needed to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2),\n\nDiaz, ¶ 42; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557, and because that is what Jacobsen had asserted in\n\nhis pleadings and arguments.\n\n¶122 Nevertheless, based on its mistaken assumption about the District Court’s intent, the\n\nCourt proceeds to revise the class claim as follows (underlining added):\n\n       As originally certified: “(B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and\n       practice in Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its\n       zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship\n       between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole.”\n\n       As revised by the Court: “(B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern\n       and practice in Montana resulted in damages to the members of the class by operation\n       of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship\n       between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole.” Opinion,\n       ¶ 47.\n\nThe Court then, on its own initiative, augments the relief available to the class members. In\n\naddition to the declaratory and injunctive remedies certified by the District Court, the Court\n\nannounces that the class trial will “set the stage” for “individual monetary relief” in “later\n\nindividual trials.” Opinion, ¶¶ 43, 46, 49, 90. The Court explains that the class trial will\n\ndetermine Allstate’s liability for a UTPA violation, and the later individual trials will\n\n                                              81\n\fdetermine class members’ “compensatory damages.” Opinion, ¶¶ 49, 57, 66, 90. The Court\n\nalso announces that class members may seek relief for both “economic” and “emotional”\n\ninjury, Opinion, ¶ 55—something that Jacobsen never asserted, and that the District Court\n\nnever certified, in the Rule 23(b)(2) class claim and remedies.\n\n¶123 This gratuitous reworking of the case is in direct contradiction to the District Court’s\n\ncertification of this case as a class action “distinct from an independent UTPA claim for\n\ndamages under §§ 33-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.” It also contradicts the District Court’s\n\nstatement that, “as construed by the court, Plaintiff’s asserted UTPA-based class claim\n\nneither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages.” In fact, the only\n\nmonetary relief that Jacobsen discussed in his argument supporting class certification was\n\n“disgorgement of illicit profits from the unlawful [CCPR] program.” Acknowledging the\n\nlimitations of Rule 23(b)(2) certification, Jacobsen did not propose that the class action\n\nwould result in monetary damages under § 33-18-242, MCA. His theory, rather, was unjust\n\nenrichment—that Allstate had unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by\n\nusing patently unlawful claim settlement practices, as evidenced by Allstate’s ability to\n\noutperform the industry. The District Court accepted this theory, but found that an\n\ninjunction allowing class members to return to square one, rather than an injunction requiring\n\nAllstate to “disgorge illicit profits,” would be the proper remedy. The Court thus errs in\n\nreframing Jacobsen’s class claim as a springboard for future individual trials on damages.\n\nThe class claim, as construed and certified by the District Court, does not determine whether\n\nAllstate is liable for actual damages under the UTPA. The District Court did not certify a\n                                             82\n\fclass action under § 33-18-242, MCA; it certified a class action under Title 27, chapters 8\n\nand 19, MCA.\n\n¶124 “[A]ppellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but\n\nessentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.”\n\nNASA v. Nelson, 562 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 746, 756 n. 10 (2011) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The Court’s choice to remake this class action disregards this fundamental premise\n\nof our adversarial system. The Court’s citation to § 3-2-204(1), MCA—see Opinion, ¶ 47—\n\nis clearly misplaced. That provision simply grants this Court authority to “affirm, reverse, or\n\nmodify any judgment or order appealed from.” Section 3-2-204(1), MCA. It does not give\n\nthis Court authority to fundamentally remake the case to state claims and remedies that the\n\nappellee neither asserted in the district court nor raised in a cross-appeal before this Court.\n\nIronically, the Court uses the arguments of the appellant (Allstate) opposing class\n\ncertification as justification to revise the class claim and remedies in a way that exposes the\n\nappellant to significantly greater liability.\n\n             III. Flaws in the Court’s Remade Class Claim and Remedies\n\n¶125 Besides the questionable procedural aspect of the Court’s action, the remade class\n\nclaim and class remedies are flawed for additional reasons.\n\n¶126 First, as an initial matter, the Court’s Opinion is internally inconsistent. Pursuant to\n\nthe District Court’s Order, the class is seeking a declaratory judgment as to three issues:\n\n(A) that the CCPR violates § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as applied to the class of\n\nunrepresented claimants as a whole; (B) that Allstate’s systematic use of the CCPR “caused\n                                                83\n\findivisible harm to the class as a whole”; and (C) that Allstate acted with actual malice. See\n\n¶ 109, supra. Now, under the Court’s rewording of issue (B), the class is seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that Allstate’s systematic use of the CCPR “resulted in damages to the\n\nmembers of the class.” Opinion, ¶ 47. At the same time, however, the Court states\n\nrepeatedly that whether class members suffered damages is to be determined in later\n\nindividual trials. See Opinion, ¶ 46 (“Damages claims may be determined in later individual\n\ntrials after [the] class trial . . . .”), ¶ 57 (the specifics of a class member’s injuries will “be\n\naired in a later, individual suit for damages”), ¶ 66 (“The later individual trials would allow\n\nAllstate to present evidence that individual class members suffered no injury.”), ¶ 78 (“Here,\n\nadjudicating the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would not involve a . . .\n\ndetermination of compensatory damages.”), ¶ 90 (“the class members would be entitled to\n\nonly the compensatory damages they can prove in the individual cases”). Our Opinion\n\nleaves the District Court and the parties guessing as to how the fact-finder in the class trial is\n\nto determine whether Allstate’s use of the CCPR “resulted in damages to the members of the\n\nclass” when, under this Court’s decision, damages to the members of the class are to be\n\ndetermined in “later individual trials” at which Allstate may “present evidence that\n\nindividual class members suffered no injury.” The Court offers no explanation for this\n\nincongruity—an incongruity that arose out of the Court’s decision to insert “damages” into\n\nthe class claim.\n\n¶127 Second, the question whether Allstate’s use of the CCPR “resulted in damages to the\n\nmembers of the class” cannot be answered on a classwide basis in any event. A claimant is\n                                                84\n\fnot damaged under § 33-18-201(6), MCA, unless the insurer’s liability for the claim was\n\n“reasonably clear.” A claimant is not damaged under § 33-18-201(1), MCA, unless the\n\nmisrepresented facts were “pertinent” to coverages “at issue.” A claimant is not entitled to\n\ndamages under the UTPA unless the alleged damages were “proximately caused” by the\n\nUTPA violation. Section 33-18-242(4), MCA. A claimant is not entitled to damages under\n\nthe UTPA “if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or\n\nthe amount of the claim.” Section 33-18-242(5), MCA. These are all highly individualized,\n\ncase-specific criteria.\n\n¶128 Third, under the legal authority discussed above and in Justice Baker’s Dissent, class\n\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper where the requested injunctive or declaratory\n\nrelief would simply serve as a basis for eventually providing monetary relief. Dissent,\n\n¶¶ 97-99; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (“[Rule 23(b)(2)] does not authorize class\n\ncertification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of\n\nmonetary damages.”). I agree with Justice Baker’s analysis and conclusion that the Rule\n\n23(b)(2) class trial which the Court conceives in today’s Opinion is for the purpose of laying\n\na foundation for individualized awards of monetary damages. Dissent, ¶ 99. This approach\n\nis wholly inconsistent with Rule 23(b)(2)’s history and purpose.5 As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained:\n\n\n       5\n        Prior to 1962, a form of class action was permitted in Montana under § 93-2821, RCM\n(1947). This statute, originally enacted by the first territorial Legislature in 1864 as part of the\nBannack Statutes, simply provided that “when the question is one of a common or general interest,\nof many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before\n                                                85\n\f       Because Rule 23 “stems from equity practice” that predated its codification,\n       Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997), in determining\n       its meaning we have previously looked to the historical models on which the\n       Rule was based, Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 841-845 (1999). As\n       we observed in Amchem, “[c]ivil rights cases against parties charged with\n       unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples” of what (b)(2) is\n       meant to capture. 521 U.S., at 614. In particular, the Rule reflects a series of\n       decisions involving challenges to racial segregation—conduct that was\n       remedied by a single classwide order. In none of the cases cited by the\n       Advisory Committee as examples of (b)(2)’s antecedents did the plaintiffs\n       combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide injunction.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557-58 (brackets in original).\n\n¶129 Fourth, using class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) to “set the stage” for later\n\nindividual trials on compensatory damages, Opinion, ¶¶ 46, 49, 90, presents due process\n\nproblems. Classes certified under Rule 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) are “mandatory classes: The\n\nRule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even\n\noblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558;\n\nsee also M. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). Rule 23(b)(3), on the other hand,\n\n\n\nthe court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.” In 1961, the Legislature repealed\n§ 93-2821, RCM, and various other statutes and replaced them with the Montana Rules of Civil\nProcedure, which took effect on January 1, 1962. See Laws of Montana, 1961, ch. 13. Montana’s\nRule 23 was identical in all material respects to then-existing Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. In 1966, several of the federal rules were amended, including Rule 23. See 39 F.R.D.\n69, 94-98 (1966). Correspondingly, this Court issued an order in 1967 adopting amendments to the\nMontana Rules of Civil Procedure. In re Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, No. 10750-7 (Sep. 29,\n1967, filed Oct. 10, 1967). As noted in our order, the amendments to the Montana Rules were\n“patterned after either the 1963 or the 1966 amendments to the Federal Rules,” the rationale being\nthat it “would be desirable to maintain uniformity with the Federal Rules insofar as they are suitable\nto Montana practice.” In this regard, we adopted Federal Rule 23 in its entirety. In light of this\nbackground, the history of Federal Rule 23 is directly applicable and relevant to Montana Rule 23.\nSee also Sieglock v. Burlington N. Santa Fe Ry. Co., 2003 MT 355, ¶ 10, 319 Mont. 8, 81 P.3d 495\n(because Montana Rule 23 is identical to federal Rule 23, “federal authority is instructive on the\nissue of class certification”).\n                                                 86\n\f       allows class certification in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater\n       procedural protections. Its only prerequisites are that “the questions of law or\n       fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only\n       individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available\n       methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.” Rule\n       23(b)(3). And unlike (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not\n       mandatory; class members are entitled to receive “the best notice that is\n       practicable under the circumstances” and to withdraw from the class at their\n       option. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558; see also M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), (c)(2)(B).\n\n¶130 The absence of such procedural protections in a class action predominantly for\n\nmonetary damages violates due process. Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 987\n\n(9th Cir. 2011) (citing Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985)).6\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court,\n\n       [t]he procedural protections attending the (b)(3) class—predominance,\n       superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out—are missing from\n       (b)(2) not because the Rule considers them unnecessary, but because it\n       considers them unnecessary to a (b)(2) class. When a class seeks an\n       indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once, there is no reason to\n       undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate or\n       whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute.\n       Predominance and superiority are self-evident. But with respect to each class\n       member’s individualized claim for money, that is not so—which is precisely\n       why (b)(3) requires the judge to make findings about predominance and\n       superiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does not require that\n       class members be given notice and opt-out rights, presumably because it is\n       thought (rightly or wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is\n       mandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue in this manner\n       complies with the Due Process Clause. In the context of a class action\n\n       6\n         Phillips Petroleum held that an absent plaintiff is entitled to procedural due process\nprotection before he may be bound concerning a claim for money damages or similar relief at law.\nThe plaintiff must be given “notice,” “an opportunity to be heard and participate in the litigation,”\nand “an opportunity to remove himself from the class by executing and returning an ‘opt out’ or\n‘request for exclusion’ form to the court.” 472 U.S. at 811-12, 105 S. Ct. at 2974.\n                                                 87\n\f       predominantly for money damages we have held that absence of notice and\n       opt-out violates due process. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S.\n       797, 812 (1985). While we have never held that to be so where the monetary\n       claims do not predominate, the serious possibility that it may be so provides an\n       additional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the monetary claims\n       here.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558-59 (emphasis in original).\n\n¶131 That is precisely the problem the Court has created by transforming this case into a\n\nclass action under § 33-18-242, MCA. Apparently, Allstate’s liability to class members\n\nunder § 33-18-242(1), MCA, will be determined in a class trial, which will “set the stage” for\n\nlater individual trials on damages under § 33-18-242(4), MCA. Opinion, ¶¶ 49, 90. Because\n\nthis class action is certified under Rule 23(b)(2), the class is mandatory and the\n\npredominance, superiority, notice, and opt-out protections of Rule 23(b)(3) do not apply. If\n\nJacobsen loses on the merits, then the class members’ individual claims for damages will be\n\nseriously compromised, if not totally barred. See Randall v. Rolls-Royce Corp., 637 F.3d\n\n818, 820 (7th Cir. 2011). This approach of “depriving people of their right to sue” by\n\napproving a mandatory class absent notice and opt-out rights violates the Due Process\n\nClause. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2559.\n\n¶132 The fact that the class trial may also result in injunctive relief (in addition to the\n\ncompensatory damages the Court envisions in later individualized trials), Opinion, ¶ 90, does\n\nnot alter this conclusion. Even if injunctive relief is the “predominant” remedy,\n\n       [t]he mere “predominance” of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to\n       justify elimination of Rule 23(b)(3)’s procedural protections: It neither\n       establishes the superiority of class adjudication over individual adjudication\n       nor cures the notice and opt-out problems. We fail to see why the Rule should\n                                             88\n\f       be read to nullify these protections whenever a plaintiff class, at its option,\n       combines its monetary claims with a request—even a “predominating\n       request”—for an injunction.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2559 (emphases in original); see also Ellis, 657 F.3d at 986-87.\n\n¶133 For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court errs in remaking this class action into one\n\nthat determines liability for damages under § 33-18-242, MCA. Before concluding this\n\ndiscussion, it is necessary to address McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,\n\nInc., 672 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 2012), upon which the Court relies heavily. See Opinion, ¶¶ 41,\n\n42, 43, 45, 46, 57, 66. The plaintiffs in that case sought certification, under Rule 23(b)(2), to\n\ndetermine whether Merrill Lynch was engaged in practices that had a disparate impact on\n\nmembers of the class in violation of federal antidiscrimination law, and to provide\n\ncorresponding injunctive relief. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483. The plaintiffs also sought\n\ncertification, under Rule 23(b)(3), for compensatory and punitive damages; however, such\n\ncertification was not at issue on appeal. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483. The issues were\n\nwhether the plaintiffs could obtain interlocutory review of the district court’s certification\n\ndecision and whether, under Wal-Mart, Merrill Lynch’s delegation of decision-making\n\nauthority to local managers precluded certification of a classwide claim for injunctive relief.\n\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 484-91. The Court of Appeals (speaking through Judge Posner)\n\nnoted that “the only issue of relief at present is whether to allow the plaintiffs to seek class-\n\nwide injunctive relief” under Rule 23(b)(2). McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491. He concluded\n\nthat certification for this purpose was appropriate. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491-92. Then,\n\nnear the end of the opinion, Judge Posner opined that if the classwide issue were ultimately\n                                               89\n\fresolved in the plaintiffs’ favor (i.e., with a finding that Merrill Lynch’s policies cause racial\n\ndiscrimination and are not justified by business necessity), then there could be hundreds of\n\nseparate suits for back pay. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 492. He did not hold, however, as the\n\nCourt implies, that Rule 23(b)(2) may be used as an integral component of a larger damages\n\naction. Indeed, such a holding would have been inconsistent with Seventh Circuit precedent.\n\n¶134 In Randall, the Court of Appeals (again speaking through Judge Posner) rejected the\n\nplaintiffs’ attempt to cloak a damages action in a Rule 23(b)(2) certification. Judge Posner\n\nobserved that “[c]lass action lawyers like to sue under [Rule 23(b)(2)] because it is less\n\ndemanding, in a variety of ways, than Rule 23(b)(3) suits, which usually are the only\n\navailable alternative. Of particular significance, plaintiffs may attempt to shoehorn damages\n\nactions into the Rule 23(b)(2) framework, depriving class members of notice and opt-out\n\nprotections.” Randall, 637 F.3d at 825 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nJudge Posner noted that it may be permissible in a Rule 23(b)(2) action to grant monetary\n\nrelief that is incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief, but he cautioned that\n\n“incidental” here means “requiring only a mechanical computation,” Randall, 637 F.3d at\n\n825; in other words, “the calculation of monetary relief will be mechanical, formulaic, a task\n\nnot for a trier of fact but for a computer program,” Johnson v. Meriter Health Servs.\n\nEmployee Ret. Plan, 702 F.3d 364, 372 (7th Cir. 2012).7 See also Lemon v. Intl. Union, 216\n\nF.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir. 2000) (incidental damages do not depend in any significant way on\n\n\n       7\n         Judge Posner, writing for the court in Johnson, 702 F.3d at 372, opined that Wal-Mart “left\nintact the authority to provide purely incidental monetary relief in a (b)(2) class action,” but he\n                                                90\n\fthe intangible, subjective differences of each class member’s circumstances and do not\n\nrequire additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits of each individual’s case). Judge\n\nPosner explained in Randall that the plaintiffs’ monetary claims for back pay were not\n\n“incidental” under this definition because\n\n       calculating the amount of back pay to which the members of the class would\n       be entitled if the plaintiffs prevailed would require 500 separate hearings. The\n       monetary tail would be wagging the injunction dog. An injunction thus\n       “would not provide ‘final’ relief as required by Rule 23(b)(2). An injunction\n       is not a final remedy if it would merely lay an evidentiary foundation for\n       subsequent determinations of liability.”\n\n637 F.3d at 826 (quoting Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 634 F.3d 883, 893 (7th\n\nCir. 2011)).\n\n¶135 Kartman likewise undercuts this Court’s reliance on McReynolds. In the remade class\n\naction devised by the Court, the class trial is to determine whether Allstate violated the\n\nUTPA, and if a violation is found, then “compensatory damages” for “economic” and\n\n“emotional” injuries and “underpayment” of benefits is to be adjudicated in later individual\n\ntrials. Opinion, ¶¶ 49, 55, 68, 90. In the later individual trials, Allstate may present evidence\n\nthat individual class members suffered no injury. Opinion, ¶ 66. Thus, it may turn out that\n\nAllstate is liable in damages to some class members and not others. Under this scheme,\n\n“[Allstate’s] liability cannot be determined on a class-wide basis, but instead requires\n\nindividualized factual inquiries into the merits of each [class member’s] claim.” Kartman,\n\n\n\n\nacknowledged that the Ninth Circuit has expressed doubt about this in Ellis, 657 F.3d at 986.\n                                               91\n\f634 F.3d at 893. That is not a proper use of Rule 23(b)(2). Reviewing a similar scheme, the\n\nKartman court observed:\n\n       The [district court] judge said he would use the Rule 23(b)(2) proceeding to\n       assess State Farm’s “liability” on the damages claims. Perhaps by this the\n       judge meant that he intended to use the Rule 23(b)(2) class proceeding to\n       adjudicate only those common issues pertaining to State Farm’s liability for\n       breach of contract and bad faith, while reserving the more claimant-specific\n       issues—such as the calculation of damages—for subsequent individual\n       adjudication. However, as we have explained, Rule 23(b)(2) governs class\n       claims for final injunctive or declaratory relief and is not appropriately\n       invoked for adjudicating common issues in an action for damages. A damages\n       class may be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) and particular issues identified for\n       resolution on a class-wide basis pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4). Or, in an\n       appropriate case, a Rule 23(b)(2) class and a Rule 23(b)(3) class may be\n       certified where there is a real basis for both damages and an equitable remedy.\n        As we have explained, that is not the case here; neither Rule 23(b)(3) nor\n       Rule 23(c)(4) is implicated.\n\nKartman, 634 F.3d at 895 (emphases in original, citations omitted); see also e.g. Jamie S. v.\n\nMilwaukee Pub. Schs., 668 F.3d 481, 499 (7th Cir. 2012) (“a claim for class-wide injunctive\n\nand declaratory relief does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) if as a substantive matter the relief\n\nsought would merely initiate a process through which highly individualized determinations\n\nof liability and remedy are made”). McReynolds did not overrule these precedents, and this\n\nCourt misreads the McReynolds opinion in suggesting otherwise.\n\n¶136 For the reasons noted by the Court and Justice Baker, Rule 23(b)(3) is unavailable to\n\nJacobsen as a basis for certifying a class action. Opinion, ¶ 62; Dissent, ¶ 100. His class\n\nclaim is valid, if at all, under Rule 23(b)(2) only. In this regard, setting aside my concerns\n\nabout commonality, typicality, and adequacy (discussed below), the District Court construed\n\nJacobsen’s filings to assert a plausible Rule 23(b)(2) class action—one that determines\n                                             92\n\fwhether the program at issue (the CCPR) is per se invalid as to all class members, and that\n\nprovides a single injunction allowing all class members (in the event the CCPR is found\n\nunlawful) to have their claims re-opened and re-adjusted. Jacobsen’s class claim, the District\n\nCourt found, is “a UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action claim for declaratory and\n\nderivative non-compensatory injunctive relief”; it “neither constitutes nor is tantamount to a\n\nclaim for compensatory damages.” Seventh Circuit precedent, including McReynolds, does\n\nnot support our converting this Rule 23(b)(2) action for narrow injunctive relief into a broad\n\nRule 23(b)(3) action for compensatory damages—particularly without the procedural\n\nprotections that attend a Rule 23(b)(3) certification. If anything, the cases cited above\n\nrepudiate this approach.\n\n¶137 In sum, the Court’s remade class claim and class remedies are, in my view: contrary\n\nto the District Court’s construction of Jacobsen’s claim; internally inconsistent; incapable of\n\nbeing determined on a classwide basis; not proper for certification under Rule 23(b)(2); and\n\nviolative of class members’ due process rights. For all of these reasons, I cannot join the\n\nCourt’s Opinion.\n\n                              IV. Rule 23(a) Requirements\n\n¶138 As a final matter, I briefly discuss my concerns relating to the requirements of\n\nRule 23(a).\n\n¶139 First, I believe the Court should definitively state what standard is to be applied when\n\nassessing commonality under Rule 23(a)(2). Opinion, ¶¶ 33, 50 (declining to resolve this\n\nquestion). The Court, and Justice Baker in her Dissent, acknowledge confusion in our\n                                              93\n\fcaselaw regarding this issue. Despite “this Court’s long history of relying on federal\n\njurisprudence when interpreting the class certification requirements of Rule 23,” Chipman v.\n\nN.W. Healthcare Corp., 2012 MT 242, ¶ 52, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193, we stated in\n\nMattson v. Mont. Power Co. (Mattson III), 2012 MT 318, ¶ 37, 368 Mont. 1, 291 P.3d 1209,\n\nthat “[t]he question arises as to whether Montana . . . should abandon its ‘permissive’\n\napproach to Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement in favor of the Wal-Mart majority’s\n\nmore stringent standard.” We have not yet answered that question. We have avoided the\n\nissue here, as we did in Mattson III, by indicating that the more stringent Wal-Mart standard\n\nwas satisfied in any event. Opinion, ¶¶ 33, 50; Mattson III, ¶ 37. Yet, evaluating the\n\npropriety of the District Court’s decision pursuant to Wal-Mart, and conducting our own\n\nexhaustive analysis under the Wal-Mart standard, without definitively setting forth our\n\nstandard of review, emphasizes the need for us to provide direction in this area of law.\n\nWithout guidance, this issue will likely be raised repeatedly in the district courts. And,\n\nabsent our directive to the contrary, it is likely that district courts will continue to assess\n\ncommonality under the more stringent Wal-Mart standard, as fewer issues are left to be\n\nraised on appeal. The District Court here analyzed the facts and law pursuant to Wal-Mart.\n\nThe Court today has similarly conducted its analysis pursuant to Wal-Mart. The question\n\nstill remains, however, as to whether the Wal-Mart standard is the controlling standard in\n\nMontana. While I understand the necessity for robust adversarial argument and briefing, as\n\nwell as an appropriate factual scenario, I think litigants and the trial courts need a definitive\n\n\n                                               94\n\fstatement from this Court as to what standard is to be used. I believe the Court does the\n\nbench and bar a disservice in neglecting to address the appropriate standard to apply.\n\n¶140 Second, I do not believe that the class claim here—neither the one certified by the\n\nDistrict Court nor the one remade by this Court—satisfies the commonality requirement of\n\nRule 23(a)(2). In my view, there are no questions of law or fact common to the class.\n\nJacobsen’s class claim is that the CCPR is per se invalid under subsections (1) and (6) of\n\n§ 33-18-201, MCA. These two subsections, however, demand consideration of highly\n\nindividualized, case-specific criteria. The District Court recognized this, but concluded that\n\na common question of law or fact could be formulated for the class by essentially setting\n\naside the case-specific criteria of subsections (1) and (6) and evaluating the CCPR’s validity\n\nbased on the general principles embodied in these two provisions. As discussed, the District\n\nCourt reasoned that “§§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, essentially require Allstate to promptly,\n\naccurately, truthfully, fairly, and in good faith adjust bodily injury and property damage\n\nclaims.” The District Court construed the class claim to be that Allstate’s use of the CCPR\n\nviolates these general principles, “irrespective of individual outcomes.”            This Court\n\napparently adopts the same analysis. Opinion, ¶ 40.\n\n¶141 I question this approach of evaluating the validity of the CCPR—or any other\n\nsettlement practice, for that matter—under § 33-18-201, MCA, based on certain criteria that\n\nare selectively plucked from the statute, while ignoring other criteria in the statute. It strikes\n\nme that this approach violates the cardinal rule that, “[i]n the construction of a statute, the\n\noffice of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance\n                                               95\n\fcontained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.”\n\nSection 1-2-101, MCA. The Legislature crafted the various subsections of § 33-18-201,\n\nMCA, to address specific settlement practices. Subsection (1) states that an insurer may not\n\n“misrepresent pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.”\n\nSubsection (6) states that an insurer may not “neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate\n\nprompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably\n\nclear.” I do not subscribe to the view that the fact-finder in a class trial can determine\n\nwhether the CCPR is per se invalid under subsections (1) and (6)—as to all class members—\n\nby simply disregarding the individualized inquiry plainly required by the statute as to such\n\nquestions as whether liability had become reasonably clear, whether the allegedly\n\nmisrepresented facts were pertinent to coverages at issue, and whether Allstate had a\n\nreasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim (see\n\n§ 33-18-242(5), MCA).\n\n¶142 I do not mean to suggest that no class action is possible under § 33-18-201, MCA. I\n\ndo believe, however, that the supposed common question here—whether Allstate’s use of the\n\nCCPR violates § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA—cannot be answered for an entire class of\n\nclaimants. Whether Allstate deliberately crafted the CCPR in such a way as to avoid review\n\non a classwide basis (an allegation that surfaced in the District Court proceedings) is beside\n\nthe point. Our duty here is to ascertain whether, under the criteria of § 33-18-201(1) and (6),\n\nMCA, there is a question of law or fact that “is capable of classwide resolution—which\n\nmeans that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the\n                                              96\n\fvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. In my view,\n\nthere is no such common question, and I thus would hold that commonality, under Rule\n\n23(a)(2), is not met.\n\n¶143 Third, I also share Justice Baker’s concerns about whether Jacobsen meets the\n\ntypicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) and (4). Dissent, ¶ 96 n. 2. The\n\nnamed plaintiff’s claim will be typical of the class where there is a nexus between the injury\n\nsuffered by the plaintiff and the injury suffered by the class. McDonald v. Washington, 261\n\nMont. 392, 402, 862 P.2d 1150, 1156 (1993). Such nexus normally exists where proving the\n\nnamed plaintiff’s claim will necessarily prove all class members’ claims. McDonald, 261\n\nMont. at 402, 862 P.2d at 1156.\n\n¶144 Here, Jacobsen does not contend that the amount of his settlement was unfair or\n\ninequitable or that his claim was not promptly resolved. Section 33-18-201(6), MCA.\n\nMoreover, he cannot claim that Allstate, through the CCPR’s “attorney economics script,”\n\nmisrepresented pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue to\n\nJacobsen’s detriment, § 33-18-201(1), MCA, given that he actually consulted and retained\n\ncounsel who assisted him with settling his claim. Jacobsen’s claim was adjusted to a\n\nrepresented settlement. He therefore is not a member of the class, which is defined as all\n\nunrepresented claimants “whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana to an\n\nunrepresented settlement since deployment” of the CCPR. Jacobsen has already had his\n\nclaim re-opened and re-adjusted for payment of additional settlement amounts for his bodily\n\ninjury claim. Consequently, he cannot have his claim re-opened. Further, Jacobsen no\n                                              97\n\flonger pursues a property damage claim, which is included in the class definition, and he is a\n\nthird-party claimant seeking emotional distress damages.            He thus would not be\n\nrepresentative of first-party claimants or those claimants with property damage. Lastly,\n\nJacobsen’s claims will be subject to unique defenses, not the least of which are: different\n\nstatutes of limitations for first- and third-party claims; his admission that he spoke to an\n\nattorney but chose not to hire one; the basis of his emotional distress; and his desire to have\n\nan early settlement. I thus would hold that Jacobsen’s claims are not typical and that he is\n\nnot an adequate representative of the class under Rule 23(a)(3) and (4), respectively.\n\n                                       V. Conclusion\n\n¶145 In conclusion, I believe the Court has wrongly remade this case into an action for\n\ndamages under the UTPA (§ 33-18-242, MCA) and, in so doing, has distorted the rules for\n\ncertifying a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and jeopardized class members’ due process rights. I\n\nfurther believe that the Rule 23(a) requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequacy are\n\nnot met here. For all of the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n                                                   /S/ LAURIE McKINNON\n\n\n\n\n                                              98\n\f",

As we recounted in\n\nJacobsen I, Jacobsen suffered bodily injuries and property damage in an automobile accident\n\ncaused by Allstate’s insured in 2001. Allstate admitted liability and negotiated a settlement\n\nwith Jacobsen while he was unrepresented by counsel. Allstate’s adjuster, Chuck Conners\n\n                                               3\n\f(Conners) used Allstate’s Claim Core Process Redesign (CCPR) program to process\n\nJacobsen’s claim. The CCPR is a system of claims adjusting guidelines that Allstate\n\nimplemented in 1995 to fast track settlements and reduce the amount paid out on claims.\n\nConners utilized the general outlines of the CCPR in settling Jacobsen’s claim. The program\n\nfacilitated a quick, unrepresented settlement six days after the accident for $3,500 and 45\n\ndays of “open” medical payment. As part of the settlement, Jacobsen signed a release.\n\n¶7     Roughly three weeks later, Jacobsen began experiencing significant pain. Jacobsen\n\ncontacted Conners and asked him to reconsider the release and provide additional assistance.\n\nConners refused because Jacobsen had signed a release. Jacobsen retained counsel, who\n\nsuccessfully persuaded Allstate to rescind the release and re-open Jacobsen’s claim. Due to\n\nthe efforts of Jacobsen’s newly-hired attorney, Allstate settled Jacobsen’s claim for $200,000\n\non November 27, 2002, roughly 18 months after his initial, unrepresented settlement for\n\n$3,500.\n\n¶8     Thereafter, Jacobsen retained new counsel and filed a complaint against Allstate\n\nseeking compensatory damages for various violations of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices\n\nAct (UTPA), common law bad faith, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress\n\n(IIED and NIED respectively), and also seeking punitive damages pursuant to § 27-1-221,\n\nMCA. Jacobsen ultimately sought compensatory damages based on the attorney fees he\n\nincurred in pursuing his underlying claim and punitive damages based on Allstate’s alleged\n\nmalicious conduct.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f¶9     The jury returned a verdict in favor of Jacobsen on October 19, 2006, finding Allstate\n\nliable for common law and statutory bad faith and awarding Jacobsen $68,372.38 in\n\ncompensatory damages. The jury specifically found that Allstate violated the UTPA by\n\nmisrepresenting pertinent facts regarding the claim and neglecting to attempt in good faith to\n\npromptly, fairly, and equitably settle a claim in which liability was reasonably clear. The\n\njury also awarded Jacobsen $350,000 in punitive damages based on its finding that Allstate\n\nacted with actual malice.\n\n¶10    Following the verdict, both Jacobsen and Allstate appealed various rulings by the\n\nDistrict Court. Our resolution of these appeals comprises Jacobsen I. One issue under\n\nconsideration in Jacobsen I concerned the discovery of what were termed the “McKinsey\n\ndocuments.” The McKinsey documents consist of around 12,500 PowerPoint slides\n\nproduced by McKinsey & Company (McKinsey), a management consulting firm, for\n\nAllstate. The CCPR program is a distillation of the studies and recommendations contained\n\nin the McKinsey documents, and they consequently provide a more complete understanding\n\nof the program. However, Jacobsen was unaware of the existence of the McKinsey\n\ndocuments at the time of his initial discovery request or motion to compel production of the\n\nCCPR. When he became aware of them, Jacobsen sought leave of the court to assert new\n\nindividual and class action claims against Allstate and to pursue additional discovery. The\n\nDistrict Court denied these requests, finding that they would “cause substantial prejudice and\n\nundue delay, burden, and expense[.]” Jacobsen I, ¶ 55.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f¶11    In his pre-remand appeal, Jacobsen argued that the District Court erred by denying his\n\nrequest for further discovery. We found that because “the issue before the District Court was\n\nnot whether to re-open discovery, but whether to compel Allstate to produce documents that\n\nwere within Jacobsen’s original discovery request,” it was “unnecessary to determine\n\nwhether Jacobsen demonstrated due diligence or excusable neglect[.]” Jacobsen I, ¶ 57. We\n\nconcluded “[t]he McKinsey documents were indeed critical to Jacobsen’s theory that\n\nAllstate’s policies regarding unrepresented claimants constituted bad faith” and reversed the\n\nDistrict Court’s decision. Jacobsen I, ¶ 58.\n\n¶12    We ultimately remanded the case for a new trial, finding that the jury’s award of\n\ncompensatory damages could not be based solely on Jacobsen’s incurred attorney costs and\n\nfees and that there could be no punitive damages following this reversal of the compensatory\n\ndamages award. We also ordered the court to allow the jury to consider Jacobsen’s\n\nemotional distress damages and directed the District Court to compel the production of the\n\nMcKinsey documents. Jacobsen I, ¶ 67.\n\n¶13    On remand, bolstered by the production of the McKinsey documents, Jacobsen filed a\n\nmotion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint that added class action claims\n\nconcerning Allstate’s CCPR program.         Count Four of Jacobsen’s Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint, filed May 6, 2010, contained the newly-added class action claims. Jacobsen\n\nbased the class claims on his prior individual theories asserting violations of the UTPA1 and\n\n\n       1\n      Jacobsen specifically alleged Allstate’s CCPR violated §§ 33-18-201(1) & (6),\nMCA. Section 33-18-201(1), MCA, prohibits misrepresenting “pertinent facts or\n                                          6\n\fcommon law bad faith. Specifically, Count Four alleged that Allstate’s CCPR program\n\nviolated the UTPA “and/or common law bad faith laws” by intentionally misrepresenting\n\nthat unrepresented claimants generally received more compensation than represented\n\nclaimants and by settling unrepresented claims via an inadequate “fast track” component of\n\nthe CCPR that resulted in unfair settlements. Count Four asserted these claims on behalf of\n\n“all unrepresented individuals who had either third party claims or first party claims against\n\nAllstate whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana using its CCPR program.”\n\n¶14    Count Five presented a claim for a common fund recovery of attorney fees incurred in\n\npursuing the class action, and Count Six presented a claim for attorney fees as a “Private\n\nAttorney General” by asserting that the State of Montana had failed to enforce §§ 33-18-\n\n201(1) and (6), MCA. Regarding class relief, Jacobsen requested class certification,\n\ninjunctive relief prohibiting Allstate from using the CCPR program in Montana, an\n\ninjunction requiring Allstate to “re-open all claims in which liability was reasonable [sic]\n\nclear in which the Defendant applied the CCPR paradigm in settling such cases,” an\n\ninjunction requiring Allstate to disgorge unlawful profits, the award of punitive damages,\n\nand attorney fees.\n\n¶15    Jacobsen filed a motion for class certification on May 7, 2010, proposing a class\n\ndefinition encompassing “all unrepresented individuals who had either third-party claims or\n\n\n\n\ninsurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.” Section 33-18-201(6)\nprohibits neglecting “to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable\nsettlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.”\n                                              7\n\ffirst-party claims against Allstate whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana using\n\nits CCPR program.”\n\n¶16    The District Court certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class in its methodical June 30, 2012\n\nOrder. In the course of its analysis, the Court noted the United States Supreme Court’s\n\nadmonition in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219618\"><a href=\"/opinion/219618/wal-mart-stores-inc-v-dukes/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2551-52 (2011), to conduct a\n\n“rigorous” Rule 23 analysis. The Court also construed the substantive essence of Plaintiff’s\n\nasserted class claim to be, irrespective of individual outcomes, that the CCPR’s settlement\n\npractices “constitute a common pattern and practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6),\n\nMCA, as generally applied to the class as a whole, thereby resulting in indivisible harm to\n\nthe class as a whole . . . .” The court accordingly certified the following class claim:\n\n       (A) the Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment adjusting practices are a\n       common pattern and practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as\n       generally applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole;\n\n       (B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana\n       caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum\n       economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between\n       Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; and\n\n       (C) Allstate acted with “actual malice,” as defined by § 27-1-221(2), MCA, by\n       intentionally, deliberately, and consciously creating and disregarding a high\n       probability that the net effect of its Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment\n       practices would result in net settlement payouts to the class as a whole less\n       than the net amount previously sufficient to fully and fairly settle\n       unrepresented claims under Montana law[.]\n\nAs support, the Court found that Jacobsen had proffered “substantial credible evidence” that\n\nAllstate systematically adjusted unrepresented first and third-party claims involving bodily\n\n\n                                              8\n\finjury or property damage “in the same general manner” under the CCPR program. The\n\nCourt thus rejected Allstate’s claim that Jacobsen could not establish that all unrepresented\n\nclaimant’s settlements were unfair by reasoning that Jacobsen’s claims concerned the\n\n“preliminary manner, means, and course of adjustment systematically applied to the class as\n\na whole in the context of the insurer’s duties under §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA,” and not\n\nthe “ultimate outcomes” of individual claims.\n\n¶17    The Court restructured Jacobsen’s class definition as follows:\n\n       (1) all unrepresented claimants who made first-party or third-party claims to\n       Allstate;\n       (2) for an amount in excess of the applicable policy deductible;\n       (3) for bodily injury or property damage related to an underlying motor\n       vehicle incident or occurrence; and\n       (4) whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana to an unrepresented\n       settlement since deployment in Montana of the various versions of the\n       Casualty CCPR (CCPR Implementation Manual (Tort States)).\n\nThe Court considered this reformed definition to be “sufficiently precise and homogenous\n\nfor purposes of Rule 23.” Using this reformed class definition the Court determined that\n\nJacobsen’s class claim satisfied Rule 23(a)’s four prerequisites—numerosity, commonality,\n\ntypicality, and adequacy. The Court certified Jacobsen’s claim as a Rule 23(b)(2) class\n\naction and certified the following class action remedies as available upon proof of the\n\ncertified class claim:\n\n       (A) [a] declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of the\n       certified class claim [which we have recounted in ¶ 16];\n\n       (B) [a] mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f              (1) give all class members court-appointed notice of the right and\n              opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment of their\n              individual claims by timely returning a proof of claim form; and\n\n              (2) re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt of a\n              timely filed proof of claim;\n\n       (C) class-wide punitive damages pursuant to §§ 27-1-220 and 27-1-221(2),\n       MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-referenced class-wide conduct;\n       and\n\n       (D) common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs upon a\n       class-wide punitive damages award[.]\n\nAllstate appeals the court’s certification of Jacobsen’s class claims pursuant to Rule 232 as\n\nwell as the court’s consideration of what Allstate argues was inadmissible evidence during\n\nthe certification proceedings.\n\nAllstate’s CCPR Program and the McKinsey Documents.\n\n¶18    Due to Jacobsen’s contention that Allstate’s application of the CCPR program to\n\nunrepresented claimants amounts to statutory and common law bad faith, a brief summary of\n\nthe program, and the related McKinsey documents, is in order.\n\n¶19    Allstate hired McKinsey in the early 1990’s to help redesign its claims process. This\n\nredesign was prompted by Allstate’s recognition that while claims expenses were low, total\n\npayouts were increasing at a pace above the industry average. The McKinsey documents\n\noutlined a claim settlement process, like the CCPR program, to lower claims payouts by\n\nincreasing claimant contact and reducing attorney involvement. McKinsey essentially\n\n\n       2\n         A more thorough analysis of the District Court’s application of Rule 23(a) and\n(b) will be provided in the course of our legal discussion.\n                                             10\n\fadvocated “increasing the number of early unrepresented settlements” while “holding the\n\nline” on represented claims. This focus flowed from research showing that represented\n\nclaims settled for 2-3 times more than unrepresented claims, that Allstate claims adjusters\n\nwere not effectively initiating early contact or communicating with claimants, and that this\n\nfailure to promptly and effectively communicate with claimants made claimants more likely\n\nto hire lawyers. The McKinsey documents ultimately styled claims adjusting as a “zero\n\nsum” economic game where if Allstate gains by reducing settlements, others—including\n\n“medical providers, plaintiff attorneys, and claimants”—“must lose.”\n\n¶20    Allstate’s CCPR program consequently strives to reduce overall claims payouts by\n\nestablishing a more centralized, regimented claims adjusting process focused on quick\n\nclaimant contact, building rapport, reducing claimant representation rates, and shuttling\n\ncertain claims into a “fast track” system. Allstate applies the CCPR to both third and first-\n\nparty claimants.\n\n¶21    Here, Allstate’s adjuster, Conners, utilized the CCPR program to obtain a fast track,\n\nunrepresented, reduced payment settlement of Jacobsen’s claim. Jacobsen alleges that the\n\nCCPR program systematically violates the rights of unrepresented claimants as provided to\n\nthem by the UTPA. Jacobsen specifically takes issue with the application of the CCRP’s\n\n“fast track” system, “9-step process,” and “attorney economics script” to his claim.\n\n¶22    First, the “fast track” system seeks to promote settlement with claimants within 12\n\ndays of the accident. Jacobsen alleges that the system promotes quick settlements at the\n\nexpense of fair settlements. A “Fast Track Evaluation Worksheet” controls whether a claim\n                                             11\n\fis amenable to “fast track” processing and requires: the claimant is unrepresented, there are\n\nno coverage questions, there are only soft tissue injuries and a good prognosis, no residuals,\n\nno aggravation of preexisting conditions, and treatment for less than 60 days. In this case,\n\nafter Jacobsen accepted the initial $3,500 settlement, Conners processed Jacobsen’s claim\n\nunder the CCPR’s “fast track” guidelines for unrepresented claims.\n\n¶23    Second, Conners generally utilized the “9-step process” for unrepresented claimant\n\ncontact. The CCPR’s Initial Claimant Contact Outline for unrepresented claimants directs\n\nadjusters to: (1) establish empathy and gather injury facts; (2) confirm Allstate’s customer\n\nservice pledge; (3) gather loss facts; (4) confirm Allstate’s liability decision; (5) discuss\n\npayment of medical bills and lost wages; (6) assist with car repairs; (7) assist with alternate\n\ntransportation; (8) explain the bodily injury settlement process and discuss attorney\n\neconomics; and (9) close the claim and follow-up. Jacobsen alleges the 9-step process\n\nincreases Allstate’s profits at the expense of good faith settlements.\n\n¶24    Third, in accordance with the CCPR, Conners discussed attorney economics with\n\nJacobsen. The CCPR process explicitly seeks to reduce the number of represented claims to\n\nreduce claims payouts. This goal was motivated by Allstate’s determination that represented\n\nclaimants typically settled for 2-3 times (and perhaps up to 5 times) the amount\n\nunrepresented claimants received. To reduce attorney involvement, the CCPR aims to build\n\nrapport with claimants though quick, empathetic contact, and directs adjusters to utilize an\n\n“attorney economics script.” The script states:\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       [q]uite often our customers ask if an attorney is necessary to settle a claim.\n       Some people choose to hire an attorney, but we would really like the\n       opportunity to work directly with you to settle the claim.\n\n       Attorneys commonly take between 25-40% of the total settlement you receive\n       . . . plus expenses incurred. If you settle directly with Allstate, however, the\n       total amount of the settlement is yours.\n\n       At any time in the process you may choose to hire an attorney. I would,\n       however, like to make an offer to you first. This way, should you go to an\n       attorney, you would be able to negotiate with the attorney so his/her fees\n       would only apply to amounts over my offer to you.\n\nThe script’s instructions counsel against improperly dissuading claimants from seeking\n\nrepresentation and instruct adjusters to remind claimants that they are free to hire an attorney\n\nat any time and discuss the relevant statute of limitations. However, the script does not\n\ncontain information advising that Allstate found that represented claimants generally\n\nreceived higher settlements. Jacobsen alleges Allstate’s portrayal of “attorney economics”\n\ninduced him into believing unrepresented claimants generally received more compensation\n\nfor injuries and resulted in an initially unfair settlement.\n\n\n\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶25    We afford trial courts the broadest discretion when reviewing a decision on class\n\ncertification.

The District Court based its class certification on a meticulous\n\nreview of the evidence behind the pleadings. As class certification requires that the plaintiff\n\nsatisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a), we will address each requirement in turn.\n\n              i. Numerosity—Rule 23(a)(1)\n\n¶30    As noted, Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the proposed class be “so numerous that joinder\n\nof all members is impracticable.” Here, the Court found that Jacobsen, using the deposition\n\nof Allstate Agent Conners, “reasonably estimated the size of the first proposed class [in\n\nJacobsen I] at around 600 members.” Because Jacobsen had enlarged the class post-remand\n                                              16\n\fby adding first-party claimants and automobile-related property damage claims, the Court\n\nconcluded that the post-remand class met Rule 23(a)(1)’s numerosity requirement. Allstate\n\ndoes not challenge this conclusion on appeal.\n\n              ii. Commonality—Rule 23(a)(2)\n\n¶31    Allstate does contest the Court’s finding that the proposed class satisfied the\n\ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). Rule 23(a)(2) requires “questions of law or fact\n\ncommon to the class.” Because the requirements of the rule are disjunctive, a party seeking\n\nclass certification must have either common questions of law or fact, and total commonality\n\nis not required. Sieglock, ¶ 11. The commonality requirement has therefore generally been\n\nseen as a relatively low burden for plaintiffs. See Diaz v.

Federal\n\nRule 23(a)(2) jurisprudence was further developed in 2011 by the U.S. Supreme Court in\n\nWal-Mart v. Dukes. The Wal-Mart decision has raised the dual questions of whether it plots\n                                            17\n\fa new course for “commonality” analysis and if this course materially differs from our own.\n\nWe first considered Wal-Mart’s treatment of Rule 23(a)(2) in Chipman. There, we\n\nrecognized that the Wal-Mart decision had departed from our heretofore “minimal standard”\n\nand had “significantly tightened the commonality requirement.” Chipman, ¶¶ 47-48. We\n\nthen applied the Wal-Mart decision’s “reasoning” concerning Rule 23(a)(2) and upheld the\n\nclass certification order. Chipman, ¶¶ 47, 52. We next considered Rule 23(a)(2) and Wal-\n\nMart two months later in our Mattson III decision. There, we again referenced the Supreme\n\nCourt’s apparent tightening of Federal Rule 23(a)(2)’s requirements and noted “a recent\n\ndivergence between the federal approach and Montana’s approach to the commonality\n\nrequirement.”    Mattson III, ¶ 35.      However, despite our application of Wal-Mart’s\n\n“reasoning” in Chipman, the Mattson III decision portrayed our decision to follow Wal-\n\nMart’s interpretation of Rule 23(a)(2) as an open question best left for some “future case.”\n\nMattson III, ¶ 37. Despite disclaiming our adoption of Wal-Mart’s commonality reasoning,\n\nMattson III still analyzed, and upheld, the District Court’s class certification pursuant to the\n\nsupposedly “more stringent” federal standard. Mattson III, ¶ 37.\n\n¶33    As Justice Baker observed in her dissenting opinion in Mattson III, our varying\n\nembrace of Wal-Mart in Chipman and Mattson III perhaps “introduce[d] confusion into our\n\nclass certification standards . . . .” Mattson III, ¶ 45 (J. Baker, dissenting). Our opinion in\n\nMattson III recognized this, and we determined that “[i]t may be necessary in a future case—\n\nwhere the issue is properly briefed and argued, and the choice of one standard over the other\n\nis dispositive of the commonality inquiry—to decide whether Montana will retain its more\n                                              18\n\fpermissive approach or instead adopt the Wal-Mart majority’s approach.” Mattson III, ¶ 37.\n\nThis, however, is not that future case. Neither Jacobsen’s nor Allstate’s arguments hinge on\n\nthe potential differences between Wal-Mart’s and Montana’s approaches to commonality.\n\nMoreover, the District Court applied Wal-Mart in its order certifying the class. Because we\n\naffirm the District Court’s certification of the class decision under Wal-Mart, the choice of\n\none standard over the other is not dispositive. We therefore need not decide whether\n\nMontana will retain its approach to commonality or how these approaches differ, and we will\n\nproceed with a discussion of Jacobsen’s proposed class in the context of Wal-Mart.\n\n                     a. Wal-Mart and F. R. Civ. P. 23(a)\n\n¶34    In Wal-Mart, the U.S. Supreme Court considered a proposed class of 1.5 million\n\ncurrent and former female Wal-Mart employees “who [alleged] that the company\n\ndiscriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or\n\npromotions ....” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2547.3 There, as here, the Court dealt with the\n\nrequirements of the identical Federal Rule 23(a)(2).          To satisfy the commonality\n\nrequirement, the plaintiffs had proffered statistical evidence about pay and promotion\n\n\n       3\n          We must note that the unusual size of the Wal-Mart class presented unique\nchallenges that may make the case inapposite to the classes generally proposed in Montana.\nSee Mattson III, ¶ 20 (at least 3,000 class members); Pallister v.

The unique need in Wal-Mart to find some sort of\ncommon contention that would bind 1.5 million disparate individuals prompted a level of\nskepticism towards class certification that would likely never arise in Montana.\n                                              19\n\fdisparities between genders, anecdotal reports of discrimination from female employees, and\n\nthe expert testimony of a sociologist.

Cal. 2004). In the course of its Rule 23(a) analysis, the District Court\n\nnoted that “the party seeking certification must provide certain facts sufficient to satisfy Rule\n\n23(a),” that “the\n\ncourt’s analysis [of Rule 23] must be rigorous,” and that “ ‘the class determination generally\n\ninvolves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the\n\nplaintiff’s cause of action.’ ” Dukes, 222 F.R.D. at 143-44. Wal-Mart opposed the\n\ncommonality finding largely by advancing the unique nature of individual stores and its\n\npractice of giving local managers substantial discretion in pay and promotion decisions.\n\nDukes, 222 F.R.D. at 151.\n\n¶35    Wal-Mart appealed the class certification, contesting, inter alia, the District Court’s\n\nconclusion that the class met the commonality requirement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed after\n\ngranting a re-hearing en banc. See Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n\n2010). Wal-Mart again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari, issuing its\n\nopinion in 2011. The majority considered the decision on commonality to be the “crux” of\n\nthe case and engaged in an analysis of Federal Rule 23(a)(2)’s requirements. The Court\n\nattempted to clarify the application of Rule 23(a)(2)’s language and establish the proper\n\nstandard of Rule 23(a)(2) adjudication. For our purposes, this clarification produced two\n\nimportant holdings, the first concerning the sufficiency of a plaintiff’s common contentions\n                                               20\n\fand the second regarding the proper, “rigorous” level of Rule 23(a) analysis. We will\n\nexamine these clarifications in turn.\n\n¶36    First, the majority cautioned that the language of the commonality rule is “easy to\n\nmisread, since ‘[a]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common\n\n‘questions.’ ” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (citation omitted). Thus, the majority sought to\n\nclarify what sort of common questions of law or fact satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). The majority\n\nemphasized that plaintiffs may not merely raise droves of superficial common questions\n\n(providing “Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart?” as an example). Instead, the\n\nplaintiffs’ common legal or factual contentions must “demonstrate that the class members\n\n‘have suffered the same injury’ ” by asserting a common contention “of such a nature that it\n\nis capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will\n\nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-\n\nMart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. 4 This emphasis logically flows from the Court’s prior justification\n\nof the class-action device’s departure from the usual rule of individual litigation: “permitting\n\nan issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion\n\nunder Rule 23.” Falcon, 457 U.S. at 155 (quoting Califano, 442 U.S. at 700-01).\n\n¶37    Second, the Supreme Court sought to clarify what it saw as an inconsistent, and\n\ninadequate, level of Rule 23(a) review in the lower federal courts. In doing so, the Wal-Mart\n\ndecision embraced what has been termed a “rigorous” form of Rule 23(a) analysis. A\n\n\n       4\n        It should be noted that the majority retained the permissive recognition that “for\npurposes of Rule 23(a)(2) ‘[e]ven a single [common] question’ will do.” Wal-Mart, 131\n                                            21\n\f“rigorous” level of Rule 23(a) analysis was previously adopted by a majority of the federal\n\nCircuit Courts, and the “more rigorous” approach adopted by the Second, Fourth, Fifth,\n\nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits requires district courts to make specific findings that each\n\nrequirement of Rule 23(a) has actually, not presumably, been met. Dukes, 603 F.3d at 583.\n\nThe Wal-Mart decision adopted the “more rigorous” approach, as district courts may certify\n\na class “only if” they are satisfied that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have actually been\n\nsatisfied. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. Further, in the course of making the required\n\ndetermination that Rule 23(a) has actually been satisfied, “ ‘sometimes it may be necessary\n\nfor the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification\n\nquestion.’ ” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160). Thus, to the\n\nWal-Mart majority, a proper “rigorous” Rule 23(a) analysis specifically requires that the\n\ndistrict court determine each requirement of Rule 23(a) has been actually met and allows, but\n\ndoes not require, the district court to probe beyond the pleadings and touch aspects of the\n\nmerits to make this determination. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.\n\n¶38    The Wal-Mart majority’s application of the clarified commonality requirement\n\nprovides some further insight into its Rule 23(a)(2) analysis. Because the plaintiffs’ class\n\naction alleged a company-wide policy of gender discrimination in violation of Title VII, the\n\nSupreme Court recognized that “proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with\n\nrespondents’ merits contentions that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of\n\ndiscrimination.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552. The majority viewed the size of the class\n\n\nS. Ct. at 2556.\n                                             22\n\fand disparate nature of Wal-Mart’s employment decisions as particular problems, and\n\ndetermined that “[w]ithout some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions\n\ntogether, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members’ claims for\n\nrelief will produce a common answer to the crucial questions why was I disfavored.” Wal-\n\nMart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552. To provide this glue, the majority required the plaintiffs to prove\n\nthat a company-wide policy existed. The majority accordingly reviewed the plaintiffs’\n\nproffered evidence and concluded that it could not prove that a company-wide policy existed.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553-57. Thus, the Supreme Court probed beyond the pleadings to\n\ndetermine a merits issue—whether Wal-Mart even had a company-wide pay or promotion\n\npolicy—to determine if the plaintiffs could present a common contention amenable to\n\nclasswide resolution. Unlike the present case, because the plaintiffs could not prove a\n\nuniform plan or policy, they could not present the question of whether they, and the proposed\n\nclass members, had suffered a common injury as a result.5\n\n\n        5\n           Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected the propriety of a merits inquiry at the class\ncertification stage for a Rule 23(b)(3) class. The case, Amgen Inc., et al. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and\nTrust Funds,133 S.

Materiality is key in a § 10(b)\nclass action suit because it is an essential predicate for the fraud-on-the-market theory that supports the\npresumption of “classwide reliance on those misrepresentations and omissions through the information-\nprocessing mechanism of the market price.” Amgen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at __, 133 S.

However, the Supreme Court held that proof that a\ndefendant’s misrepresentations or omissions materially affected their stock price was not required at the Rule\n23(b)(3) class certification stage. Amgen, 563 U.S. at __, 2013 LEXIS at 8. While Wal-Mart recognized that\ncourts may intrude on merits issues, like materiality, to certify a class, the Amgen majority held that Rule\n23(b)(3) “requires a showing that questions common to the class predominate, not that those questions will be\nanswered, on the merits, in favor of the class.” Amgen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at __, 2013 LEXIS at 8.

In applying this standard, the District Court looked\n\nbeyond the allegations of Jacobsen’s pleadings to find: (1) that Jacobsen had produced\n\n“significant proof” that Allstate intentionally and systematically failed to disclose that\n\nrepresented claimants received settlements 2-3 times larger than unrepresented claimants; (2)\n\nthat Allstate developed the CCPR with the intent that it would reduce the net sum of\n\nunrepresented settlements; (3) that Allstate hid this profit motive by developing the facially\n\nneutral CCPR; (4) that Allstate consciously disregarded a high probability that the net effect\n\nof the CCPR would result in less than a full and fair settlement; and (5) that the CCPR\n\nprogram had resulted in “a substantial, objectively measurable reduction in the total amount\n\nof compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole . . . .” The Court\n\nconcluded that these factual showings united Jacobsen and the class member’s claims and\n\nsupported the following common questions of law and fact, asking whether:\n\n        (1) the Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment adjusting practices are a\n        common pattern and practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as\n        generally applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole;\n\nis to select the ‘metho[d]’ best suited to adjudication of the controversy ‘fairly and efficiently.’ ” Amgen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at __, 133 S. Ct. at 1191. Amgen accordingly supports our recognition that the focus of the class action\ndevice is the fair and efficient adjudication of common claims. Further, both Amgen and Wal-Mart dealt with\nquestions concerning what sort of merits inquiry was appropriate. The Amgen decision limited merits\ninquiries in the context of a Rule 23(b)(3) securities fraud claim, supporting the view that Wal-Mart’s more-\nskeptical level of Rule 23 analysis is not universally applicable.\n                                                      24\n\f       (2) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana\n       caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum\n       economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between\n\n       Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of [sic] as a whole; and6\n\n       (3) Allstate has consciously disregarded a high probability that the net effect\n       of its Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment practices would result in net\n       settlement payouts to the class as a whole less than the net amount previously\n       sufficient to fully and fair[ly] settle unrepresented claims under Montana law.\n\nDespite potential factual disputes, the Court determined that Jacobsen’s proposed class\n\naction would provide the sort of “common answers” concerning the CCPR program that\n\nWal-Mart encouraged. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. Indeed, because the presence of a\n\ncommon pattern and practice is undisputed, Jacobsen’s common contentions do not suffer\n\nfrom the same defect as did the plaintiffs’ contentions in Wal-Mart.\n\n¶40    On appeal, Allstate first argues that because Jacobsen’s claim is not predicated upon\n\nan assertion that his third-party bodily injury or property damage claims were ultimately\n\nsettled unfairly or underpaid, there is no commonality between his claim and the alleged\n\nclass claims. However, this argument misses the thrust of Jacobsen’s class claim on remand.\n\nWhile Jacobsen’s requested relief and alleged bases for damages are not entirely clear, the\n\nDistrict Court determined that his claim asserts, in part, that Allstate’s application of the\n\nCCPR to unrepresented claims is a per se violation of the UTPA and results in actual harm in\n\n\n       6\n          As discussed below, however, we believe it is necessary to revise the second\ncertified class claim in light of our holding reversing the certification of a class-wide\npunitive damages award.\n                                               25\n\fthe form of an alleged zero-sum economic plan systematically reducing claims payments to\n\nincrease profits. This contention does not merely allege that the proposed class members\n\nsuffered a violation of the same provision of law “in many ways.” See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct.\n\nat 2551. Here, the presence of a “general business practice,” the CCPR, is undisputed.\n\nWhether this general practice, as applied to unrepresented claimants, violates §§ 33-18-\n\n201(1) or (6), MCA, is just the sort of question that may efficiently drive the resolution of\n\nthe litigation. See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (commonality requires the plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate that the class members “have suffered the same injury.”). This determination\n\nwould not turn on the countless discretionary decisions that troubled the Wal-Mart majority,\n\nand would not be hampered by a variety of unique defenses and circumstances. Jacobsen’s\n\nassertion that the CCPR, as applied to the class members, represents a per se violation of the\n\nUTPA would resolve a necessary, central question applicable to all class members.\n\n¶41     Judge Richard Posner’s treatment of the Rule 23(b)(2) class certification at issue in\n\nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2012)\n\nsupports this conclusion. There, plaintiffs filed a class action suit alleging that Merrill Lynch\n\nengaged in a system of racial discrimination by utilizing a company policy that allowed\n\nbrokers to form teams and that then rewarded team performance with increased broker\n\naccount distributions. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483, 489-90.7 The plaintiffs asked that the\n\n\n        7\n         Essentially, the plaintiffs contended that the teams were “little fraternities” that, intentionally or not,\nchose members largely from similar racial groups. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 489. Brokers did not have to\njoin teams, but being accepted by a successful team generally increased performance. Account distributions\nwere made when a broker left Merrill Lynch to distribute his clients’ accounts and they were based on the past\nsuccess of the brokers. Thus, if a broker wasn’t selected by a successful team, he may miss out on future\n                                                        26\n\fclass be certified to determine whether the defendant had engaged in discriminatory practices\n\nand to provide injunctive relief. The plaintiffs also wanted compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483. The district court denied class certification and the\n\nplaintiffs appealed. On appeal, Judge Posner considered the denied certification in the\n\ncontext of Wal-Mart. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 488. Judge Posner found that, unlike the\n\nWal-Mart plaintiffs, Merrill Lynch’s policies were an employment decision by the top\n\nmanagement that was appropriate for a class-wide determination as to whether the\n\nchallenged policies had a disparate racial impact. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 489.\n\n¶42     Judge Posner reversed the district court’s denial of class certification despite his\n\nrecognition that a final resolution of the class’s claims would require hundreds of separate\n\ntrials to determine compensatory and punitive damages. As Judge Posner noted,\n\n        [o]bviously a single proceeding, while it might result in an injunction, could\n        not resolve class members’ claims. Each class member would have to prove\n        that his compensation had been adversely affected by the corporate policies,\n        and by how much. So should the claim of disparate impact prevail in the\n        class-wide proceeding, hundreds of separate trials may be necessary to\n        determine which class members were actually adversely affected by one or\n        both of the practices and if so what loss he sustained—and remember that the\n        class has 700 members. But at least it wouldn’t be necessary in each of those\n        trials to determine whether the challenged practices were unlawful.\n\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 490-91 (emphasis added). To Judge Posner, “[t]he kicker is\n\nwhether ‘the accuracy of the resolution’ would be ‘unlikely to be enhanced by repeated\n\n\n\naccount distributions, which would cause him to not be selected by the successful teams, and a vicious cycle\ncould ensue. The plaintiffs argued that minority brokers at Merrill Lynch found it hard to join good teams\n“and as a result don’t generate as much revenue or attract and retain as many clients as white brokers do.”\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 490.\n                                                    27\n\fproceedings.’ ” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491.

Met-Coil Systems Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780874\"><a href=\"/opinion/780874/theresa-mejdrech-v-met-coil-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2003),\n\n       If there are genuinely common issues, issues identical across all the claimants,\n       issues moreover the accuracy of the resolution of which is unlikely to be\n       enhanced by repeated proceedings, then it makes good sense, especially when\n       the class is large, to resolve those issues in one fell swoop while leaving the\n       remaining, claimant-specific issues to individual follow-on proceedings.\n\nMejdrech, 319 F.3d at 911. A single class trial for injunctive relief that determines the\n\nlegality of a commonly applied procedure or policy is not only economical and attractive,\n\nbut, in the alternative, “[t]here isn’t any feasible method . . . for withholding injunctive relief\n\nuntil a series of separate injunctive actions has yielded a consensus for or against the\n\nplaintiffs.” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491; see also Wal-Mart, 131 S.Ct at 2557 (“[T]he key\n\nto the (b)(2) class is the, indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy\n\nwarranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful\n\nonly as to all of the class members or as to none of them,”).\n\n¶43    Regarding the class’s requested monetary relief, Judge Posner recognized “there may\n\nbe no common issues,” and determined “in that event the next stage of the litigation, should\n\nthe class-wide issue be resolved in favor of the plaintiffs, will be hundreds of separate suits\n\nfor backpay (or conceivably for compensatory damages and even punitive damages as well .\n\n. . .).” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 492. The Court approved of this bifurcated approach,\n\ndetermining declaratory and injunctive relief in a class trial and individual monetary relief in\n\nlater individual trials, because “the lawsuits will be more complex if, until issue or claim\n\npreclusion sets in, the question whether Merrill Lynch has violated the antidiscrimination\n                                                28\n\fstatutes must be determined anew in each case.” McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 492. As the D.C.\n\nCircuit recently noted, “[t]he pututative [sic] class in McReynolds was appropriate post-Wal-\n\nMart because the economic harm alleged by each class member was the result of the same\n\ncorporate-wide policies and if the policies were held unlawful then a question central to the\n\nvalidity of each class member’s claim would be resolved in one stroke.” DL v.

This\n\nrecognition aligns with the Wal-Mart majority’s interest in certifying classes that will drive\n\nthe resolution of litigation and it supports affirming the certification of Jacobsen’s class to\n\ndetermine the certified declaratory and injunctive relief.

Ct. at 2551. Allstate specifically argues that the first proposed common\n\nquestion—whether the CCPR as applied to unrepresented claimants violates the UTPA—“is\n\nprecisely the type of generalized question that Wal-Mart identified as insufficient.”\n\nHowever, as discussed above, the determination of whether Allstate’s common application\n\nof the CCPR to the proposed class violated the UTPA is the sort of “common scheme of\n\ndeceptive conduct” that necessarily presents common questions of law and/or fact. See\n\nFerguson, ¶ 28; McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491.\n\n¶46    Allstate further contends that this question cannot be answered as a class question\n\nbecause an independent cause of action for a UTPA violation or common law bad faith\n\nrequires a showing of actual damages. Because Allstate argues a showing of actual damages\n\nwould require case-specific, individual inquiries, it asserts that the first common question\n\ncannot be answered for the class as a whole. However, as discussed above, individualized\n\ndamage inquiries generally do not preclude class certification. See Mattson III, ¶ 38 (citing\n\nMcDonald, 261 Mont. at 403-04). Damages claims may be determined in later individual\n\ntrials after a class trial has determined the availability of the requested injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491.\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\f¶47    Allstate argues the second proposed common question is deficient because whether\n\nAllstate’s profit increased while total compensation paid to the class decreased does not\n\nprovide a common answer demonstrating a violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) or (6), MCA.\n\nJacobsen responds that the second common question would answer whether the CCPR\n\ncaused indivisible “legal injury” to the class as a whole “through the use of a dishonest\n\nsystem, whether or not the monetary value of each settlement ultimately was unfair.” We\n\nagree that the second certified class claim question is deficient, but only insofar as it conflicts\n\nwith our conclusion that the Court’s certification of a class-wide punitive damages award\n\nwas improper. As framed by the District Court, the second class claim asks the class jury to\n\ndetermine whether Allstate’s systematic use of the CCPR caused indivisible harm to the\n\nclass as a whole by operation of a zero-sum economic theory and an inversely proportional\n\nrelationship between Allstate profits and compensation paid to unrepresented claimants. The\n\nCourt formulated this claim so as to justify the entry of a class-wide punitive damages award.\n\nWe believe that the second certified class claim must be revised in light of our conclusion\n\nthat punitive damages must be determined on an individualized basis, to be awarded only if\n\nthe claimant can demonstrate compensatory loss. We consequently modify the second\n\ncertified claim as follows:\n\n       (B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana\n       resulted in damages to the members of the class by operation of its zero-sum\n       economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between\n       Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; and [. .\n       .]\n\n\n                                                32\n\fSee Section 3-2-204, MCA (entitling us to “affirm, reverse, or modify any judgment or order\n\nappealed from[.]”). The District Court considered the second common contention as\n\nproposing whether the CCPR’s alleged pursuit of profits at the expense of unrepresented\n\nclaimants harmed the class by potentially violating the unrepresented claimants’ rights to\n\ngood faith adjusting of their claims under the UTPA. Answering this question, as revised,\n\nwould presumably help determine whether the CCPR was an intentional, programmatic\n\neffort to produce unfair settlements in violation of the UTPA. While an increase in profits\n\nconcurrent with a decrease in total payments to the class as a whole may not prove a\n\nviolation of the UTPA by itself, the District Court did determine that significant proof\n\nexisted that Allstate developed the CCPR program “with the knowledge and intent” that its\n\nimplementation would reduce the net sum of unrepresented settlements. This revised inquiry\n\nwould help advance the determination of the legality of the CCPR while avoiding our\n\nconcerns with a class-wide award of punitive damages, as discussed below.\n\n¶48    The third common contention asks whether Allstate consciously disregarded a high\n\nprobability that the net effect of the CCPR would result in decreased settlements to the class\n\nas whole. Thus, an affirmative answer to the second question, determining that the CCPR\n\nwas an intentional effort to engage in unfair settlement practices to increase profits, would\n\nlikely advance the resolution of the third question and could support a finding of actual\n\nmalice pursuant to § 27-1-221(2), MCA. However, Allstate claims that the third common\n\nquestion is deficient because Jacobsen does not assert his claim was underpaid. Jacobsen\n\nresponds that the harm at issue is insufficient class-wide settlement payouts due to the\n                                             33\n\fCCPR’s zero-sum economic focus. Because Jacobsen argues that Allstate implemented the\n\nCCPR with the intention of implementing a zero-sum economic game to systematically\n\nproduce unfair settlements and increase profits, this contention would resolve an issue\n\ncentral to each class member’s claim: whether Allstate acted maliciously by applying the\n\nCCPR with the intent of lowering payouts to increase profits.\n\n¶49    It is important to note that district courts have “broad power and discretion vested in\n\nthem by” Rule 23 “with respect to matters involving the certification and management of\n\npotentially cumbersome or frivolous class actions.” Reiter v.

Here, class-wide resolution of the proposed\n\ncommon contentions “will drive the resolution of the litigation.” Chipman, ¶ 52. Such\n\npotentially illuminating questions are the focus of Rule 23(a)(2) and, as discussed above,\n\nresolving whether the CCPR violates the UTPA would set the stage for later individual trials.\n\nMoreover, as we require, the District Court examined the evidence behind the pleadings to\n\ndetermine that the proposed class actually satisfied the commonality prerequisite. We\n\ntherefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by determining that\n\nJacobsen’s common contentions, as construed by this Court, satisfy the commonality\n\nrequirements of Rule 23(a)(2).\n\n¶50    Again, both Jacobsen and Allstate have claimed that Wal-Mart presents a heightened\n\ncommonality standard when compared with our previous conception of the rule, and both\n\napplied Wal-Mart to the case on appeal. Because of this, and because we affirm the District\n                                             34\n\fCourt’s class certification (also based on Wal-Mart), we need not address whether Wal-Mart\n\npresents a different standard and if we intend to adopt it. Mattson III, ¶ 37. Instead, as we\n\ndid in Chipman and Mattson III, we simply conclude that Jacobsen satisfies the Wal-Mart\n\ncommonality standard because the certified class claims depend upon a common contention\n\nconcerning a programmatic course of conduct that is “of such a nature that it is capable of\n\nclasswide resolution,” i.e., that “determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that\n\nis central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at\n\n2551.\n\n               iii. Typicality—Rule 23(a)(3)\n\n¶51     Regarding typicality, we have previously explained that this requirement “is designed\n\nto ensure that the interests of the named representative are aligned with the interests of the\n\nclass members, the rationale being that a named plaintiff who vigorously pursues his or her\n\nown interests will necessarily advance the interests of the class.” Mattson III, ¶ 21 (citing\n\nChipman, ¶ 53).

Typicality is not a demanding\n\nrequirement, and it “is met if the named plaintiff’s claim ‘stems from the same event,\n\npractice, or course of conduct that forms the basis of the class claims and is based upon the\n                                                35\n\fsame legal or remedial theory.’ ” Diaz, ¶ 35 (quoting McDonald, 261 Mont. at 402).

In\n\naddition, because Wal-Mart’s discussion of Rule 23(a) hinged on an analysis of\n\ncommonality, the opinion did not consider the requirements of typicality and did not purport\n\nto establish a heightened level of review.\n\n¶52    The District Court found that the nature of Jacobsen’s claim was typical of those of\n\nthe proposed class because “significant proof [exists] that Allstate subjected the class as a\n\nwhole, including but not limited to Plaintiff, to the same systematic violation of §§ 33-18-\n\n201(1) and (6), MCA, through the pattern and practice of the Casualty CCPR’s\n\nunrepresented segment adjusting practices.” Specifically, the Court found that: Jacobsen\n\nand each proposed class member are members of the above-defined class; Jacobsen and each\n\nclass member were at a minimum subjected to the same allegedly unlawful conduct\n\ngenerally; and the allegedly unlawful conduct caused harm to the class as a whole by\n\noperation of the CCPR and its alleged zero-sum economic theory. Thus, as required by our\n\nopinion in Mattson II, the District Court probed behind the pleadings to actually determine\n\nwhether Jacobsen met the typicality prerequisite.\n\n¶53    On appeal, Allstate argues that the District Court erred because “Jacobsen is not even\n\na member of the class.” Allstate supports this contention by claiming that Jacobsen lacks\n\nindividual standing because his initial release, obtained after his claim was adjusted to an\n\nunrepresented settlement pursuant to the CCPR, was rescinded, citing Hop v.

Co.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889709\"><a href=\"/opinion/889709/hop-v-safeco-ins-co-of-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889709\"><a href=\"/opinion/889709/hop-v-safeco-ins-co-of-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889709\"><a href=\"/opinion/889709/hop-v-safeco-ins-co-of-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Allstate further attempts to distinguish\n                                             36\n\fJacobsen’s claim from those of the class members by arguing that he does not contend his\n\nproperty damage claim was improperly handled and that he only seeks damages due to\n\nalleged emotional distress. Jacobsen in turn claims that the application of the CCPR is a per\n\nse violation of the UTPA, that the application of the CCPR to the class as a whole resulted in\n\nsystemic economic injury, and that both he and the class suffered emotional distress from the\n\napplication of the CCPR to their claims. Jacobsen essentially asserts that typicality isn’t\n\ndestroyed if class members display some uniqueness in the character of their individual\n\ninjuries.\n\n¶54      First, our opinion in Hop can be distinguished. There, we declined to find typicality\n\nbased on the named representative’s lack of individual standing for failing to meet the\n\nprocedural requirements of § 33-18-242(6), MCA. Hop, ¶ 20. The named representative did\n\nnot lack individual standing because of any factual differences in the substantive details of\n\nhis claim, but for bringing a claim under § 33-18-201, MCA, despite the absence of any\n\njudgment in, or settlement of, his underlying claim as required by § 33-18-242(6), MCA.\n\nThis holding is therefore inapplicable to Allstate’s argument that Jacobsen’s claim is not\n\ntypical because of the specific facts of the application of the CCPR to his unrepresented\n\nclaim.\n\n¶55      Second, Allstate’s arguments miss the aim of the typicality requirement by raising\n\nissues with the specific facts of Jacobsen’s claim and the specific relief he seeks.

Jacobsen is a member of the class as defined by the District Court.\n\nHe was an unrepresented third-party claimant bringing claims for property damage and\n\nbodily injury following a motor vehicle accident with an Allstate insured. Allstate applied\n\nthe CCPR to Jacobsen while he was unrepresented, and, at base, Jacobsen’s class claim\n\nalleges that Allstate systematically applies the CCPR to violate the rights of unrepresented\n\nclaimants under the UTPA. Jacobsen’s claim stems from the same course of conduct, the\n\napplication of the CCPR to unrepresented claimants, as the proposed class members’ claims\n\nand both Jacobsen’s and the class members’ claims are based on the same legal theory, that\n\nthis application of the CCPR violates the UTPA. The injuries that allegedly resulted among\n\nclass members, whether economic or emotional, are not sufficiently dissimilar to render\n\nJacobsen’s claim atypical of those of the class regarding this core allegation.\n\n¶56    Indeed, we have previously determined that the common application of an insurance\n\npractice to a proposed class constitutes an event, practice, or course of conduct sufficient to\n\nsatisfy the typicality requirement. See Diaz, ¶ 36; Ferguson, ¶¶ 26-28 (finding the related\n\ncommonality requirement satisfied by an allegedly programmatic breach of a duty). In\n\nChipman, we considered claims that the named plaintiffs’ claims were atypical from those of\n\nthe class in the context of a suit over the discontinuation of a sick leave buy-back program.\n\nChipman, ¶ 54. The defendant employers argued that the named plaintiffs’ claims were\n\natypical because they worked for the employers for a longer period and may or may not have\n\nattended a meeting with management. Chipman, ¶ 54. The plaintiff employees argued that\n\nthe class members’ disputes were typical because they were triggered by the same underlying\n                                              38\n\fcancellation of the buy-back program. Chipman, ¶ 54. We determined that because the\n\nclaims of the named plaintiffs and class members all arose from the same event, the plaintiffs\n\nwere able to establish “the necessary nexus between the injuries alleged by named Plaintiffs\n\nand class members.” Chipman, ¶ 56.

The district court determined that\n\ntypicality was satisfied despite the fact that the benefit plans of the named plaintiffs varied\n\nfrom those of the class members because all of the claims arose from the same event or\n\npractice and the class members relied on the same legal theory. Cates, 253 F.R.D. at 429.\n\nJacobsen’s and the class’s claims arise from the CCPR and all are proceeding under the legal\n\ntheory that the CCPR was implemented to lower claims payments to the class by violating\n\nthe rights afforded claimants under the UTPA.\n\n¶57    In addition, as we discuss below, our reformation of the requested class relief will\n\ncause the specifics of Jacobsen’s injuries to be aired in a later, individual suit for damages if\n\nthe court awards the requested class injunctive and declaratory relief. Jacobsen’s injunctive\n\nand declaratory claims arise from the same course of conduct as those of the putative class\n\nmembers, the application of the CCPR to his unrepresented claim for bodily injury and\n\nproperty damage following a motor vehicle incident. A class trial may efficiently, and\n\nappropriately, determine the legality of this program as applied to the class as a whole. See\n\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 490-91. Allstate’s concerns over Jacobsen’s typicality, centered on\n                                               39\n\fthe details of his injury and the availability of certain defenses, will be obviated if the\n\nspecifics of Jacobsen’s injuries will not be addressed in a class trial that considers only the\n\nproposed injunctive and declaratory relief. Thus, despite Allstate’s contentions, the specifics\n\nof Jacobsen’s alleged injuries do not render him atypical of the class because his claim\n\n“stems from the same event, practice, or course of conduct that forms the basis of the class\n\nclaims and is based upon the same legal or remedial theory,” McDonald, 261 Mont. at 402\n\n(quoting Jordan v.

This satisfies the typicality requirement and we affirm the District Court’s\n\ndecision.\n\n               iv. Adequacy—Rule 23(a)(4)\n\n¶58    The fourth prerequisite of Rule 23(a) allows certification only where the\n\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. M. R. Civ.\n\nP. 23(a)(4).    “‘This requires that the named representative’s attorney be qualified,\n\nexperienced, and generally capable to conduct the litigation, and that the named\n\nrepresentative’s interests not be antagonistic to the interests of the class.’ ” McDonald, 261\n\nMont. at 403, 862 P.2d at 1156 (quoting Jordan, 669 F.2d at 1323). Adequacy is therefore\n\nclosely related to commonality and typicality. Regarding potential antagonistic interests, the\n\nDistrict Court determined that because Jacobsen’s asserted class claims satisfied the\n\ncommonality and typicality requirements, Allstate had failed to show a compelling reason\n\nwhy Jacobsen’s individual interests would conflict with the common interests of the class.\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\fThe court also took notice that Jacobsen’s class counsel are competent and experienced in\n\ncomplex class action litigation.\n\n¶59    Allstate argues that Jacobsen’s claims will be subject to unique defenses that are\n\nlikely to become the focus of any trial. However, “perfect symmetry of interest is not\n\nrequired and not every discrepancy among the interests of class members renders a putative\n\nclass action untenable.” Matamoros v. Starbucks Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138 (1st Cir. 2012).\n\nWhen we apply this recognition to the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4), it is clear that\n\n“ ‘[o]nly conflicts that are fundamental to the suit and that go to the heart of the litigation\n\nprevent a plaintiff from meeting the Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy requirement.’ ” Matamoros,\n\n699 F.3d at 138 (quoting 1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 3:58 (5th ed.\n\n2012)). The potential intra-class conflicts that Allstate cites—which include Jacobsen’s\n\ndesire for an early settlement, that he may have initially decided to not hire an attorney, and\n\nthe cause of his emotional distress—are not “so substantial as to overbalance the common\n\ninterests of the class members as a whole.” Matamoros, 699 F.3d at 138. As a third party\n\nclaimant contesting the legality of the CCPR, Jacobsen has incentive to vigorously pursue\n\nthe requested injunctive and declaratory relief.    In view of this, the limited scope of the\n\nclass trial on remand, and the District Court’s considerable discretion in class certification\n\ndecisions, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that\n\nJacobsen’s interests are not antagonistic to those of the proposed class.\n\n¶60 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by certifying a M. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2) class action lawsuit?\n\n\n                                              41\n\f¶61    Once the Rule 23(a) prerequisites are satisfied, the analysis shifts to Rule 23(b).\n\nMattson III, ¶ 18. To be certified, a class must fit within one of the three types described in\n\nRule 23(b). Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2548-49. At the District Court, Jacobsen argued that his\n\nproposed class qualified under Rule 23(b)(2), or alternatively, as a “hybrid-type class”\n\ncombining elements of Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3). Rule 23(b)(2) allows a class action\n\nto be maintained if, having met the requirements of Rule 23(a), “the party opposing the class\n\nhas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final\n\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\n\nwhole[.]” M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). As the Wal-Mart decision noted, “[t]he key to the [Rule\n\n23](b)(2) class is, the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted--\n\nthe notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all\n\nof the class members or as to none of them,” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n¶62     Rule 23(b)(3) allows a class action if the court finds that the common questions of\n\nlaw or fact predominate over individual questions. The District Court declined to address\n\nJacobsen’s alternative claim for Rule 23(b)(3) relief because of the “cursory” briefing and\n\n“logical inconsistency” of a hybrid Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) class. Jacobsen does not\n\nchallenge this decision on appeal.\n\n¶63    The District Court specifically found that “significant proof” existed that Allstate, the\n\nparty opposing the class, had acted on grounds that generally applied to the class through its\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\fuse of the CCPR program.8 Following this determination, the Court examined whether\n\nJacobsen sought appropriate forms of injunctive and declaratory relief and whether\n\nJacobsen’s requested monetary relief was permissible under Rule 23(b)(2).\n\n\n\nAfter denying Jacobsen’s claims for equitable disgorgement and a vague prohibitive\n\ninjunction,9 the Court certified the following class action remedies under Rule 23(b)(2):\n\n       (A) declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of the\n       certified class claim [quoted at ¶ 16];\n\n       (B) mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:\n\n              (1) give all class members court-approved notice of the right and\n              opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment of their\n              individual claims by timely returning a proof of claim form;\n              (2) re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt of a\n              timely filed proof of claim;\n\n       (C) class-wide punitive damages pursuant to §§ 27-1-220 and 27-1-221(2),\n       MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-referenced class-wide conduct;\n       and\n\n\n\n       8\n          The District Court based this finding on its construction of Jacobsen’s class claim,\nwhich is quoted at ¶ 16, supra. The Court essentially determined that Jacobsen claimed that\nthe CCPR was a common practice in violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as applied\nto the class as a whole, that the CCPR caused economic harm to the class as a whole, and\nthat Allstate consciously disregarded the high probability that the CCPR would result in\ninsufficient net settlement payouts.\n        9\n             The Court found that that a mandatory injunction compelling disgorgement of\nunlawful profits was not appropriate in addition to punitive damages and denied its\navailability as a Rule 23(b)(2) remedy. The Court also found that Jacobsen’s requested\nprohibitive injunction enjoining Allstate from engaging in unlawful conduct as found by the\njury was fatally vague because it failed to articulate a specific prohibition that would provide\nrelief to the class as a whole. Jacobsen does not appeal either decision.\n                                               43\n\f       (D) common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs upon a\n       class-wide punitive damages award[.]10\n\nAllstate generally contests the appropriateness of the certified class remedies as applied to\n\nboth the class and Allstate, and further asserts various violations of both its, and the class\n\nmembers’, right to due process.\n\n\n\n¶64    As we explain below, we affirm the Court’s certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class\n\nasserting the above class declaratory (“(A)”) and injunctive (“(B)”) relief, but we reverse the\n\ncertification of a potential class-wide punitive damages award (“(C)”). We accordingly\n\nremand with direction to determine the availability of the above declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief in a class trial. Further, instead of considering class-wide punitive damages, the class\n\ntrial will determine whether Allstate’s implementation of the CCPR involved either actual\n\nfraud or actual malice pursuant to § 27-1-221, MCA. See § 33-18-242(4), MCA; Lorang v.\n\nFortis Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888387\"><a href=\"/opinion/888387/lorang-v-fortis-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 91, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888387\"><a href=\"/opinion/888387/lorang-v-fortis-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888387\"><a href=\"/opinion/888387/lorang-v-fortis-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Thus, the class trial will\n\ninitially determine if the CCPR violates the UPTA according to the certified declaratory\n\nrelief. If so, the Court will issue a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to give all class\n\nmembers notice of the right to re-open and re-adjust their individual claims. Last, the class\n\ntrial will determine if Allstate engaged in actual fraud or actual malice in implementing the\n\nCCPR. If so, the trier of fact in the later individual cases may determine the amount of\n\n\n\n       10\n            Allstate does not challenge the certification of common fund attorney fees on\nappeal.\n                                              44\n\findividual punitive damages to be awarded if individual actual damages are also established.\n\nWe will discuss the certified class remedies in turn.\n\n       A. The Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n\n              i. Class Cohesiveness\n\n¶65    Allstate first argues that a Rule 23(b)(2) class is inappropriate because the class lacks\n\ncohesiveness. This is essentially a restatement of Allstate’s arguments against commonality\n\nand typicality. However, because a Rule 23(b)(2) class action is considered “mandatory,”\n\nsee Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558,11 a class that lacks homogeneity could unjustly bind absent\n\nclass members to a negative decision. See Barnes v. Am. Tobacco Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759468\"><a href=\"/opinion/759468/prodliabrep-cch-p-15407-william-barnes-ciaran-mcnally-catherine-potts/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143\n\n(3d Cir. 1998). Because the relief sought must be able to affect the entire class at once, we\n\nwill examine the cohesiveness of the class in the context of a mandatory Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n\n¶66    Allstate claims the proposed class is inappropriate as a Rule 23(b)(2) class because it\n\n“would necessarily include many individuals who suffered no injury and thus could have no\n\nUTPA claim . . . .” Allstate claims both that these dissimilar class members would be\n\nunjustly bound by the action and that the lack of homogeneity would involve the\n\nadjudication of significant individual issues. However, these arguments are premised on a\n\nmisunderstanding of the nature of Jacobsen’s asserted class claims and are precluded by the\n\nscope of the class trial on remand. The individual context of any one settlement is not\n\nrelevant to the adjudication of the certified declaratory and injunctive relief and our\n\n\n       11\n         Rule 23(b)(2) classes are considered “mandatory” because the rule does not\nprovide an opportunity for class members to opt out and does not require a district court\n                                           45\n\freformation of the punitive damages portion of the certified relief removes the consideration\n\nof individual circumstances in the class trial. Thus, Allstate’s claim that not all class\n\nmembers have suffered actual harm or an unfair adjustment misses the point. The certified\n\nclass claims on remand are not intended to resolve individual cases of unfair settlement or\n\npayment. Instead, they are aimed at adjudicating the initial legality of the CCPR as applied to\n\nthe class. The later individual trials would allow Allstate to present evidence that individual\n\nclass members suffered no injury. But, the initial legality of the CCPR would not need to be\n\nre-litigated in each subsequent individual trial. See DL, 2013 U.S. App. at 22; McReynolds,\n\n672 F.3d at 491; Mejdrech, 319 F.3d at 911.\n\n¶67    As the District Court noted, our decision in Ferguson supports certifying Jacobsen’s\n\nrequested declaratory and injunctive relief as part of a Rule 23(b)(2) class. There, as part of\n\na Rule 23(b)(2) class, the plaintiff sought a declaration that the insurer, Safeco, had breached\n\nits adjustment duties through a “programmatic assertion of subrogation without first\n\ninvestigating and determining whether insureds had received their ‘made-whole’ rights.”\n\nFerguson, ¶ 33. Facing a similar claim that the requested declaratory relief would require\n\nthe adjudication of individual “made-whole” entitlements, we determined that the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim did not raise issues with Safeco’s application of the “made-whole” rule to any one\n\ninsured. Ferguson, ¶¶ 34, 39. Instead, we concluded that the plaintiff’s claim contested “the\n\nprocedures of a program of subrogation which systematically deprives all class members of\n\nany consideration of their ‘made-whole’ rights.” Ferguson, ¶ 34. Thus, like Jacobsen, the\n\n\nto afford them notice. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558.\n                                           46\n\fplaintiff in Ferguson sought a declaration requiring Safeco to follow a statutory duty prior to\n\nany consideration of the actual harm the violation of this standard caused to any individual\n\nclass member. These “class claims do not seek a determination of entitlements for each class\n\nmember and the payment of damages; rather [both] class claims seek a declaratory ruling\n\nthat will be enforced to compel [the insurer] to follow the legal standard . . . .” Ferguson, ¶\n\n34; see also Diaz, ¶ 47.\n\n¶68    Here, as in Ferguson, the plaintiff seeks “an order compelling [the insurer] to properly\n\nperform its statutory adjustment duties.” Ferguson, ¶ 36. Because Jacobsen presents a\n\ncommon question alleging a common injury, an answer will determine whether the CCPR\n\nwill be “enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of\n\nthem.” See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. The potential later individualized determinations\n\nof underpayment are not necessary to answer Jacobsen’s class claims and do not render the\n\nclass overbroad.\n\n              ii. Class Injunctive and Declaratory Relief is “Final”\n\n¶69    Allstate contends that Rule 23(b)(2) requires “final” relief, and contends the certified\n\nrelief is not final because “it only serves as a basis to present damage claims later.” Allstate\n\nlargely cites federal precedent as support for this proposition. However, we have never\n\nconstrued M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)’s use of “final” to impose a substantive obligation on\n\nplaintiffs, and it is not clear that Allstate’s citations to authority recommend that we do so.\n\nSee Richards v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186731\"><a href=\"/opinion/186731/richards-constance-v-delta-airln-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (D.C.

Insurance\n\nadjusting is squarely within Allstate’s area of expertise, not the judicial branch’s, and where\n\nwe have previously faulted injunctions for a lack of specificity, we have not required the\n\nlevel of detail Allstate now requests.\n\n¶72    Allstate’s citations to authority do not support enlisting the judiciary to draft claims\n\nadjusting policies either. For example, in Shook, plaintiffs sought to certify a class\n\ncontaining all present and future mentally ill inmates in a Colorado jail. Shook, 543 F.3d at\n\n600. The plaintiffs sought a Rule 23(b)(2) class with declaratory and injunctive relief\n\naddressing jail conditions. However, the plaintiffs suffered from a wide variety of mental\n\nillnesses and were subjected to a correspondingly wide range of treatments by the jail staff.\n\nShook, 543 F.3d at 601. The plaintiffs sought a broad injunction “establishing standards\n\nacross a wide range of areas affecting mentally ill inmates,” touching upon staffing, training,\n\ninmate housing, safety, psychiatric care, and the proper use of force. Shook, 543 F.3d at 602.\n\nThe district court denied Rule 23(b)(2) certification because plaintiffs could not show that\n\nthe defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the whole class and because the\n\nvariety within the class precluded class-wide injunctive relief. Shook, 543 F.3d at 603. The\n\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the decision, noting that “the relief plaintiffs seek would require\n                                              49\n\fthe district court to craft an injunction that distinguishes—based on individual characteristics\n\nand circumstances—between how prison officials may treat class members[.]” Shook, 543\n\nF.3d at 605 (emphasis in original). Moreover, an injunction that took the opposite tack and\n\nmerely required “adequate” services would fail to describe just what, in light of the variety of\n\nthe inmates’ needs, must be done. Shook, 543 F.3d at 606. Shook therefore does not stand\n\nfor the proposition that Rule 23(b)(2) requires a certain specificity of injunctive relief, but for\n\nthe general recognition that Rule 23(b)(2) classes must be sufficiently cohesive so that the\n\ninjunctive relief applies to the class as a whole.\n\n¶73    In Kartman, plaintiffs brought a class claim alleging, in part, that State Farm’s failure\n\nto use a uniform, objective criteria while assessing their hail-damaged roofs amounted to\n\nbreach of contract, bad faith, and unjust enrichment. Kartman, 634 F.3d at 887. As relief,\n\nplaintiffs requested compensatory and punitive damages and an injunction requiring State\n\nFarm to reinspect all class members’ roofs pursuant to a uniform and objective standard.\n\nThe district court judge certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class to adjudicate the request for an\n\ninjunction and to assess State Farm’s liability. Kartman, 634 F.3d at 888. The appellate\n\ncourt reversed, finding that plaintiffs’ only cognizable injury was for underpayment of their\n\nclaims and that the requested injunctive relief was not the proper remedy. Kartman, 634\n\nF.3d at 889-90. This finding was largely based on the court’s conclusion that State Farm had\n\nno duty to use an objective, uniform standard to determine hail-damage. Kartman, 634 F.3d\n\nat 890. Thus, the plaintiffs’ failing was that the court determined State Farm had no duty to\n\nuse a particular method to evaluate hail-damage claims, let alone a duty to use the method\n                                                50\n\fthe plaintiffs sought to impose with an injunction. Kartman, 634 F.3d at 890. This situation\n\nis distinct from the present case, where Jacobsen seeks a declaration that Allstate’s CCPR\n\nviolates the UTPA and an injunction requiring notice to the class of the right to reopen their\n\nclaims. Jacobsen, unlike the plaintiffs in Kartman, is not contesting the lack of a program or\n\nseeking to outline the contours of a legal program to be imposed on Allstate.\n\n¶74    Unlike Shook and Kartman, the certified class at issue has been subjected to a\n\ncommon practice and has allegedly suffered a common injury to statutorily conferred rights.\n\nThis common contention, as discussed, is amenable to class-wide relief. This does not\n\nmean, however, that the court must go beyond an injunction addressing tortious conduct to\n\naffirmatively dictate proper adjusting practices. See Rodriguez v.

Punitive Damages in a Rule 23(b)(2) Claim\n\n¶75    The District Court certified the availability of class-wide punitive damages pursuant\n\nto § 27-1-220 and § 27-1-221(2), MCA. The District Court determined that monetary relief\n\nis available in a Rule 23(b)(2) class under Wal-Mart if it is incidental to the declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief, affords indivisible, non-individualized relief in a single stroke, and\n\ncomports with due process by not prejudicing the rights of the class members and defendant\n\nto contest specific cases. The Court also noted that punitive damages are generally not\n\navailable without a predicate award of compensatory damages, but reasoned that an award of\n                                              51\n\fpunitive damages based on actual malice does not require an award of compensatory\n\ndamages if the evidence shows that the predicate tort caused actual harm or damage. The\n\nCourt then determined that Jacobsen’s claim was capable of showing that Allstate’s alleged\n\nzero-sum economic theory visited a form of indivisible, actual economic harm upon the\n\nentire class, which it reasoned “would constitute a sufficient predicate for a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award in this case.” The Court further concluded that a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award did not implicate the due process concerns addressed in Wal-Mart\n\nbecause it was not an individualized monetary remedy and did not litigate any claim-specific\n\nissues.\n\n¶76       Allstate initially contests the basic appropriateness of monetary damages under Rule\n\n23(b)(2), claiming that “one possible reading” of Rule 23(b)(2) is that it does not authorize\n\ncertification of monetary claims at all. The majority opinion in Wal-Mart did not go so far as\n\nto foreclose the availability of monetary relief in Rule 23(b)(2) classes, however, and it left\n\nopen the possibility that incidental monetary claims could be certified under Rule 23(b)(2).\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. However, we need not decide the matter in this case, because\n\nwe reverse the District Court’s certification of a class-wide punitive damages award based on\n\nour concerns over the award’s potential effect on the due process rights of Allstate.\n\n                 i. The Class-Wide Punitive Damages and Due Process\n\n¶77       Allstate also claims that the District Court’s certification of class-wide punitive\n\ndamages violates Allstate’s right to due process because Allstate would be precluded from\n\nraising case-specific defenses to an individual class member’s entitlement to punitive\n                                               52\n\fdamages (e.g. that individual class member’s claims were handled appropriately or paid\n\nfairly). Conversely, Allstate argues that the potential class trial would “inappropriately\n\ndevolve into a series of mini-trials “if the Court were to allow Allstate to present defenses to\n\nclass member’s entitlement to punitive damages. Jacobsen counters that our decision in\n\nGonzales established that punitive damages class claims can be maintained for systematic\n\nwrongdoing without individualized proof of harm. Jacobsen also asserts that Allstate’s\n\nproffered federal precedent does not apply in the class action context.\n\n¶78    Given the nature of the requested relief as part of a Rule 23(b)(2) class, we agree that\n\nAllstate should be able to establish defenses to individual claims to ensure that punitive\n\ndamages are not awarded to claimants that were not actually damaged by the adjustment of\n\ntheir claims under the CCPR.

It is true\n\nthat our Gonzales opinion considered the constitutionality of a class-wide punitive damages\n\naward.

Gonzales, ¶ 15.\n\nGonzales instead approved class-wide punitive damages in a combination Rule 23(b)(1) and\n\n(3) class suit where the district court certified a Rule 23(b)(3) compensatory damages class.\n\nGonzales, ¶¶ 17-19.

Here, adjudicating the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would not\n\ninvolve a similar determination of compensatory damages.

The Second Certified Class Claim\n\n¶79    Again, our conclusion that the Court abused its discretion by certifying a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award requires us to revise the second certified class claim.

Whether the District Court erred by holding that the Montana Rules of Evidence\ndo not apply to class action proceedings?\n\n¶81    Last, Allstate entered several objections before the District Court concerning the\n\nCourt’s consideration of what Allstate argued was inadmissible evidence during the\n\ncertification proceedings. In a footnote, the Court determined that the evidence Jacobsen\n\npresented in the Rule 23 certification proceedings did not need to be “in a trial-admissible\n\nform,” and denied Allstate’s objections to “the ultimate trial-admissible evidentiary\n\nsufficiency of Plaintiff’s preliminary Rule 23 factual showings in this case.”\n\n¶82    On appeal, Allstate maintains that the District Court erroneously based its class\n\ncertification order on evidence that “was clearly inadmissible under the Rules of Evidence.”\n\nAllstate argues this allegedly inadmissible evidence included opinions and statements in an\n\nexpert report, an article written by the Consumer Federation of America, an affidavit by one\n\nof Jacobsen’s attorneys, a power point presentation referred to as the “Liddy slides,” an\n\nincentive compensation plan, and affidavits and testimony from a New Mexico case that\n\nconsidered the CCPR. Jacobsen counters that his case “was grounded on dozens of\n\nMcKinsey documents” that Allstate produced on remand and that all other evidence was\n\nproperly considered. However, because the Court did not make a ruling on the admissibility\n\nof any of the evidence in question, the specific admissibility of a particular piece of evidence\n\nis not presented to this Court on appeal. Rather, we must consider the Court’s contention\n\nthat evidence need not be in a “trial admissible form” for the purposes of class certification\n\nproceedings.\n\n\n                                              55\n\f¶83    Allstate specifically contends that the District Court’s determination that “a rigorous\n\nRule 23 analysis” does not necessarily require a preliminary factual showing in “a trial-\n\nadmissible form” was error in light of our decision in Mattson II and the Montana Rules of\n\nEvidence. In Mattson II, the District Court refrained from engaging in an analysis of the\n\nmerits of the plaintiffs’ claims and stated it was required to take the plaintiffs’ allegations in\n\nsupport of the class action as true. Mattson II, ¶ 61. The District Court thereafter certified\n\nthe class. On appeal, the defendant argued that the court erred in its Rule 23 analysis by\n\ntaking the plaintiffs’ allegations as true and asserted that the court should have made its\n\ndetermination “based upon the evidence.” Mattson II, ¶ 62. We held that the court erred by\n\ndetermining it must take the plaintiffs’ allegations as true and noted a district court “certainly\n\nmay look past the pleadings” when determining if Rule 23’s requirements have been met.\n\nMattson II, ¶ 65. Quoting the Supreme Court’s decision in Falcon, we held “ ‘sometimes it\n\nmay be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the\n\ncertification question’ ” to determine actual conformance with Rule 23(a). Mattson II, ¶ 65\n\n(quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160, 102 S. Ct. at 2372). Therefore, while this “probe behind\n\nthe pleadings” may necessitate allowing discovery and hearing evidence, Mattson II also\n\ndetermined “there is no absolute requirement that a hearing be held” if “the paper record\n\nbefore the court” is adequate. Mattson II, ¶ 66. The applicability of the Montana Rules of\n\nEvidence was not addressed by this Court and was not a basis of our decision. Thus, despite\n\nAllstate’s argument to the contrary, Mattson II does not stand for the proposition that courts\n\nmust apply the Rules of Evidence in Rule 23 proceedings.\n                                               56\n\f¶84    Allstate also argues that the Montana Rules of Evidence require their application to\n\nRule 23 proceedings. In support, Allstate cites M. R. Evid. 101(a) and 104(a). Rule 101(a)\n\nstates that “[t]hese rules govern all proceedings in all courts in the state of Montana with the\n\nexceptions stated in this rule.” Rule 101(c) lists the situations in which the rules do not\n\napply, including preliminary questions of fact, grand juries, miscellaneous proceedings like\n\nthose for extradition or the issuance of warrants for arrest, “summary” proceedings, and other\n\nmiscellaneous proceedings like ex parte matters. Allstate contends that because the\n\nexceptions listed under Rule 101(c) do not include class certification proceedings, the rules\n\nmust apply. Rule 104 governs “[p]reliminary questions of admissibility” and Rule 104(a)\n\nspecifically covers “[q]uestions of admissibility generally.” While Rule 104(a) notes further\n\nsituations where the rules of evidence do not apply, it is not relevant to this case.\n\n¶85    In response, Jacobsen cites federal authority stating that courts in Rule 23 proceedings\n\n“may consider evidence that may not be admissible at trial.” Alonzo v.

R. Evid. 1101, which, like M. R. Evid. 101(c), enumerates the exceptions to\n\n\n\nthe general applicability of the rules of evidence.12 Instead, these federal courts based their\n\nconclusions on the requirements of the identical F.

The Wal-\n\nMart Court considered the plaintiffs’ production of the testimony of Dr. William Bielby, a\n\nsociological expert, as the only proffered evidence of Wal-Mart’s alleged “general policy of\n\n[gender] discrimination.” Wal-Mart, 131 S.

The\n\nSupreme Court’s opinion did not squarely address this contention, merely offering “We\n\ndoubt” that “Daubert did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage” in dicta\n\nwhile concluding “even if properly considered, Bielby’s testimony does nothing to advance\n\nrespondent’s case.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2554. Thus, the Wal-Mart majority failed to\n\naddress the application of the Rules of Evidence to class action certification proceedings and\n\nthe Court’s doubt was aimed only at the application of Daubert, a question not presented\n\nhere.\n\n¶89     Because the District Court’s inquiry into a motion for class certification is tentative,\n\npreliminary, and limited to a determination of only whether the litigation may be conducted\n\non a class basis, “the court’s analysis is necessarily prospective and subject to change . . . and\n                                               60\n\fthere is bound to be some evidentiary uncertainty.” Cox, 644 F.3d at 613. A decision on a\n\nmotion to certify a class is not a conclusive judgment on the merits of the case, and is “not\n\naccompanied by the traditional rules and procedure applicable to civil trials.” Eisen, 417\n\nU.S. at 178, 94 S. Ct. at 2153. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err by\n\ndetermining that evidence considered for the purposes of class certification need not be in\n\ntrial admissible form.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n¶90    We accordingly conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ncertifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class action. We do, however, conclude that the certification of\n\nclass-wide punitive damages was inappropriate in the context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n\nAccording to our reformation of the requested relief, we remand for a class trial to determine\n\nwhether the application of the CCPR to the class violated the UTPA, and, if so, to determine\n\nwhether the District Court should enter an order requiring Allstate to provide notice to the\n\nclass members of their right to re-open and re-adjust their claims. The trier of fact in the\n\nclass trial will also make a determination as to whether Allstate’s implementation of the\n\nCCPR program involved actual fraud or actual malice, such as could justify the entry of\n\npunitive damages following a finding of actual damages in the ensuing individual cases. If\n\nthe trier of fact determines that Allstate did not engage in either actual fraud or actual malice,\n\nthe class members would be entitled to only the compensatory damages they can prove in the\n\nindividual cases. Following the class trial, the Court shall determine whether there should be\n\na common fund recovery of class-action attorney fees and costs.\n                                               61\n\f¶91    We also conclude that the District Court did not err in its determination that class\n\ncertification proceedings do not require evidence to be in “trial admissible” form.\n\n¶92    We affirm the class certification, but modify the class claim and the certified class\n\nrelief as herein set forth.\n\n\n                                                  /S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n\nWe concur:\n\n/S/ MIKE McGRATH\n/S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n/S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n_______________________\n\n\nJustice Beth Baker, dissenting.\n\n\n\n¶93    I agree that the District Court erred in certifying class-wide punitive damages relief\n\nunder M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The Court’s attempt to preserve the class certification order is\n\nflawed, however, because it still leaves in place a class claim that cannot meet the\n\nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(2).\n\n¶94    As a preliminary matter, regarding Rule 23(a), I disagree with the Court’s statement\n\nthat Wal-Mart has raised “dual questions” that require some future case for our clarification.\n\nOpinion, ¶¶ 32-33. First, no party in this case has disputed that Wal-Mart’s analysis of the\n\ncommonality element of Rule 23(a)(2) imposed a heightened threshold for class certification.\n\nSecond, counsel for both parties agreed during oral argument that Wal-Mart’s commonality\n\nanalysis established a different standard from that used in our prior cases. We already have\n\n                                             62\n\frecognized explicitly these points. Chipman, ¶ 47. Further, we did not state in Chipman, as\n\nthe Court implies (Opinion, ¶ 28 (citing Chipman, ¶ 43)), that Montana courts “are not\n\nrequired to march lockstep with federal interpretations of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.” While that\n\nstatement in the Court’s Opinion today is not untrue, we invoked in Chipman “this Court’s\n\nlong history of relying on federal jurisprudence when interpreting the class certification\n\nrequirements” and did not consider the standards we had applied “prior to Wal-Mart.”\n\nMattson III, ¶ 53 (Baker, J., dissenting) (quoting Chipman, ¶¶ 47, 52). By perpetuating\n\nconfusion over whether Wal-Mart changed the law—a point I do not believe is reasonably\n\nopen to dispute—the Court disserves prospective class plaintiffs and defendants, as well as\n\nthe district courts that seem to be called upon with increasing frequency to decide class\n\ncertification issues.\n\n¶95    Our October 2011 adoption of comprehensive amendments to the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, in fact, came in response to the recommendation of the Court’s Advisory\n\nCommission on the Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure to bring more uniformity\n\nbetween the Montana and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 23 of the Montana Rules\n\nis now identical in all substantive respects with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules, with two\n\nexceptions not applicable here.1 No party has argued that there is a legitimate basis in this\n\ncase for this Court to part company with its federal counterparts on the standard for\n\n1\n Montana’s Rule 23, unlike its federal counterpart, allows appeal of right from an order granting or\ndenying class action certification or an order finally and definitively rejecting a proposed class\nsettlement. Compare M. R. Civ. P. 23(f) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f). The federal rule also contains a\nprovision specific to referral of certain matters to a United States Magistrate Judge. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(h)(4).\n                                                 63\n\fcommonality. The Court should refrain from interjecting speculation that it may someday\n\nchoose to do so if the right case comes along. Since the Court in any event applies the Wal-\n\nMart commonality standard (Opinion, ¶ 50), its discussion on this point is not necessary.\n\n¶96     Even assuming that all four factors of Rule 23(a) are met in this case, there is\n\nnonetheless a serious flaw in the Court’s analysis of Rule 23(b)(2). 2 “Failure to establish\n\neach requisite element of Rule 23 is fatal to class certification.” Chipman, ¶ 43. The Court’s\n\ndismissal of Rule 23(b)(2)’s “finality” requirement not only departs from our consistent\n\nreliance on federal authorities regarding class certification, but fails to apply the language of\n\nour own rule. M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), identical to its federal counterpart, provides that if\n\nRule 23(a) is satisfied, a class action may be maintained if “the party opposing the class has\n\nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive\n\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]”\n\n(Emphasis added.) The Court summarily rejects Allstate’s arguments about the “final\n\ninjunctive relief” language by declaring that we “have not recognized a substantive ‘finality’\n\n\n\n\n2\n  I harbor reservations about whether Jacobsen meets the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4),\nsince he already has obtained the relief he seeks for the class—reopening and readjustment of an\nunrepresented claim.

The Advisory Committee notes to subsection (b)(2)\n\nstate that it was intended to reach situations where “final relief of an injunctive nature or of a\n\ncorresponding declaratory nature, settling the legality of the behavior with respect to the\n\nclass as a whole, is appropriate.” This subsection of the rule does not, however, “extend to\n\ncases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money\n\ndamages.” Fed.

A request for a declaration that a\n       . . . statute is unconstitutional[, for example,] would qualify as “corresponding\n       declaratory relief” because the resulting judicial directive would have the\n       effect of “enjoining” the enforcement of the . . . statute. . . . On the other hand,\n       an action seeking a declaration concerning defendant’s conduct that appears\n       designed simply to lay the basis for a damage award rather than injunctive\n       relief would not qualify under Rule 23(b)(2). . . .

The\n\nfirst certified class claim requires the District Court to declare whether the CCPR violates\n\nMontana’s unfair claims settlement practices laws. Opinion, ¶ 64. If the answer is “yes,” the\n\nDistrict Court is to “issue a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to give all class members\n\nnotice of the right to re-open and re-adjust their individual claims.” Then, if the class trial\n\ndetermines that Allstate engaged in fraudulent or malicious conduct, “the trier of fact in the\n\nlater individual cases may determine the amount of individual punitive damages to be\n\nawarded if individual actual damages are also established.” Opinion, ¶ 64 (emphases\n\nadded).

As explained below, the case the Court decides\n\ntoday is not the case that was presented to us. This class action, as argued by Jacobsen and\n\ncertified by the District Court, is one for declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act (Title 27, chapter 8, MCA). The class remedies are a declaratory judgment,\n\nan injunction, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. The injunction gives class members the\n\noption of returning to the position they were in when they initially filed their claims, i.e.,\n\nbefore Allstate applied the CCPR to them. This is not a class action to determine liability for\n\ndamages under the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA; Title 33, chapter 18, MCA).\n\nJacobsen did not frame the class claim pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) as one that would lead to\n\ncompensatory damages; to the contrary, he conceded from the outset that some of the\n\nputative class members may have suffered no individual harm from Allstate’s use of the\n\nCCPR. All he requested was an injunction “to prohibit Allstate from using its CCPR\n\nprogram, to re-open improperly settled claims, and for disgorgement of illicit profits from\n\nthe unlawful program.” The District Court, correspondingly, did not certify any claims or\n\nremedies under the UTPA.\n\n¶103 This Court, however, proceeds to repackage this case as a UTPA action. One facet of\n\nAllstate’s liability is to be decided in a class trial, after which further liability determinations\n\nand assessments of damages are to be made in ensuing individual trials. I disagree with this\n\n\n                                                69\n\fsua sponte reworking of the case. Aside from being improper appellate practice, the scheme\n\nthe Court has devised here distorts the rules for certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and\n\ninfringes class members’ due process rights.\n\n¶104 The ensuing discussion relates primarily to my disagreement with the Court’s\n\nremaking of the case and the Court’s approach to Rule 23(b)(2) certification. However, like\n\nJustice Baker, I also harbor reservations about whether the threshold requirements of Rule\n\n23(a) have been met. I address those concerns at the end of this Dissent.\n\n        I. The District Court’s Construction of the Class Claim and Remedies\n\n¶105 Jacobsen’s Fourth Amended Complaint is far from a model of clarity. In fact, the\n\nDistrict Court noted in its class-certification Order that there is “considerable pleading\n\nimprecision on [the] face” of the complaint. This Court, likewise, acknowledges that\n\n“Jacobsen’s requested relief and alleged bases for damages are not entirely clear.” Opinion,\n\n¶ 40.\n\n¶106 Faced with this pleading imprecision, the District Court liberally “construed”\n\nJacobsen’s Fourth Amended Complaint and his arguments supporting class certification so\n\nas to arrive at class claims and remedies that could “minimally” satisfy the criteria of Rule\n\n23. Jacobsen certainly benefitted from the District Court’s efforts in this regard, and it must\n\nbe noted that, just as he has not contested other aspects of the District Court’s decision (see\n\ne.g. Opinion, ¶ 62, ¶ 63 n. 9), Jacobsen also has not cross-appealed from the District Court’s\n\nultimate determination of the class claim and the class remedies.\n\n\n                                              70\n\f¶107 The District Court perceived both individual and class claims in the Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint. In identifying the class claim, the District Court found as follows:\n\n       Separate and apart from the individual claims asserted in this case, the court\n       construes the substantive essence of Plaintiff’s asserted class claim to be that,\n       irrespective of individual outcomes, the unrepresented segment adjustment\n       practices specified in Allstate’s CCPR Implementation Manual (Tort States)\n       (hereinafter Casualty CCPR) constitute a common pattern and practice in\n       violation of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class as\n       a whole, thereby resulting in indivisible harm to the class as a whole by\n       operation of Allstate’s own zero-sum economic theory and the resulting\n       inversely proportional relationship between Allstate’s profit increases and\n       corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class\n       of unrepresented claimants as a whole.\n\nA critical term in this construction of the class claim is “indivisible harm to the class as a\n\nwhole.” This language is important because, as explained below, it reflects the limited claim\n\nand remedies that the District Court had in mind, and because this Court’s revision of the\n\nDistrict Court’s language dramatically alters the nature of this case.\n\n¶108 Jacobsen requested class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). “ ‘The key to the\n\n[Rule 23](b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy\n\nwarranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful\n\nonly as to all of the class members or as to none of them.’ ” Diaz v.

As\n\nthe Supreme Court further explained:\n\n       In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or\n       declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It\n       does not authorize class certification when each individual class member\n                                              71\n\f       would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the\n       defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class\n       member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (emphasis in original).\n\n¶109 The District Court construed Jacobsen’s substantive arguments mindful of these\n\nprinciples, correctly recognizing that Rule 23(b)(2) requires an indivisible remedy and does\n\nnot permit class certification for purposes of individualized awards of monetary damages.\n\nThe court construed Jacobsen’s requested class relief under Rule 23(b)(2) to consist of “a\n\nclaim for class-wide declaratory, injunctive, and incidental monetary relief (equitable\n\ndisgorgement and punitive damages).” The District Court declined to certify the equitable\n\ndisgorgement remedy on the ground that it was cumulative to the injunctive relief, but the\n\ncourt otherwise certified the class relief Jacobsen sought. Specifically, the District Court\n\ncertified the following claim and remedies:\n\n       (2)    Class Action Claim. The certified class claim is that:\n\n              (A)    the Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment adjusting practices\n                     are a common pattern and practice in violation of\n                     §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class\n                     of unrepresented claimants as a whole;\n\n              (B)    Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in\n                     Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by\n                     operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting\n                     inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profit\n                     increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n                     compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a\n                     whole; and\n\n              (C)    Allstate acted with “actual malice,” as defined by § 27-1-221(2),\n                     MCA, by intentionally, deliberately, and consciously creating\n                                              72\n\f                     and disregarding a high probability that the net effect of its\n                     Casualty CCPR’s unrepresented segment practices would result\n                     in net settlement payouts to the class as a whole less than the net\n                     amount previously sufficient to fully and fair[ly] settle\n                     unrepresented claims under Montana law;\n\n       (3)    Class Action Remedies. The certified class remedies available as a\n              matter of law on proof of the certified class claim are:\n\n              (A)    declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of\n                     the certified class claim;\n\n              (B)    mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:\n\n                     (1)    give all class members court-approved notice of the right\n                            and opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment\n                            of their individual claims by timely returning a proof of\n                            claim form; and\n\n                     (2)    re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt\n                            of a timely filed proof of claim;\n\n              (C)    class-wide punitive damages pursuant to §§ 27-1-220 and\n                     27-1-221(2), MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-\n                     referenced class-wide conduct; and\n\n              (D)    common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs\n                     upon a class-wide punitive damages award[.]\n\n¶110 With respect to establishing the “indivisible harm” asserted in the Class Action Claim,\n\nthe District Court explained that\n\n       the occurrence and extent of the actual harm common to the class as a whole is\n       ascertainable and at least generally measurable on an indivisible class-wide\n       basis without consideration of individual outcomes by comparative analysis of\n       relevant industry performance data and internal Allstate performance data.\n\nJacobsen’s theory is that if Allstate outperformed industry norms (in terms of profits and\n\n\n                                             73\n\freduced payouts) due to the CCPR, then the class members were indivisibly harmed.1\n\n¶111 Accordingly, setting aside the punitive damages and the common fund recovery,2 the\n\nDistrict Court certified only two class remedies. The first remedy is a declaration that the\n\nCCPR constitutes a per se prohibited claim settlement practice under § 33-18-201(1) and (6),\n\nMCA.3 The class trial must determine, therefore, that applying the CCPR was unlawful as to\n\nall class members or, conversely, to no class members. In a sense, this is analogous to\n\ndeciding a facial challenge to a statute: to prevail on such a challenge, the plaintiff must\n\nshow that “no set of circumstances exists under which the [statute] would be valid, i.e., that\n\nthe law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.” Wash.

That is, in essence, what the certified\n\nclass claim asserts regarding the CCPR: that no set of circumstances exists under which the\n\nCCPR would be valid. The CCPR is unlawful in all of its applications—as the theory\n\ngoes—because the “attorney economics script” misrepresents facts and because the “fast\n\n\n        1\n          Jacobsen proffered several studies of Allstate’s performance.

Not only would such an award implicate due process, Opinion, ¶¶ 77-78, but the\nDistrict Court did not certify compensatory damages as a class remedy and, thus, there can be no\naward of classwide punitive damages, see Jacobsen v.

If the class prevails on this claim, then the\n\nsecond remedy the District Court certified is an injunction requiring Allstate to allow each\n\nclass member to return to square one, i.e., go back to the point when his or her claim was\n\nfirst filed, before Allstate applied the CCPR.\n\n¶112 Importantly, the District Court did not certify any class claim or remedies under the\n\nUTPA itself. The UTPA recognizes “an independent cause of action [by an insured or a\n\nthird-party claimant] against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer’s violation\n\nof subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201.” Section 33-18-242(1), MCA. In\n\nsuch action, “the court or jury may award such damages as were proximately caused by the\n\nviolation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201,” as well as “[e]xemplary\n\ndamages.” Section 33-18-242(4), MCA. That is not the nature of the class action certified\n\nby the District Court here. The parties’ arguments in the District Court, and the District\n\nCourt’s ensuing analysis in its Order, confirm this conclusion. They also provide insight into\n\nthe precise nature of the class claim, as follows.\n\n¶113 First, in his briefs supporting class certification, Jacobsen asserted that this case is\n\n“squarely governed” by Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888550\"><a href=\"/opinion/888550/ferguson-v-safeco-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888550\"><a href=\"/opinion/888550/ferguson-v-safeco-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Of relevance, he quoted the following passage from that decision:\n\n             The challenge here is not to an error in Safeco’s application of the\n       “made-whole” rule to any given insured. Rather, this case challenges the\n       procedures of a program of subrogation which systematically deprives all class\n\n33-18-201, MCA.\n                                              75\n\f       members of any consideration of their “made-whole” rights. Thus, as\n       Ferguson points out in her brief on appeal, her class claims do not seek a\n       determination of entitlements for each class member and the payment of\n       damages; rather, her class claims seek a declaratory ruling that will be\n       enforced to compel Safeco to follow the legal standard in its subrogation\n       program.\n\nFerguson, ¶ 34. Jacobsen indicated that he was seeking the same sort of relief: a\n\ndeclaratory ruling that will be enforced to compel Allstate to stop using the CCPR. He\n\nfurther asserted that the “vehicle for class relief” under his Rule 23(b)(2) theory is an\n\ninjunction requiring Allstate either to re-open and re-adjust the claims, or to disgorge the\n\nprofits it made as a result of the CCPR. (As noted, the District Court chose the former.)\n\nJacobsen did not assert any entitlement to compensatory damages for class members.\n\n¶114 Second, in its brief seeking dismissal of the class claim, Allstate argued that Jacobsen\n\nhad compromised the interests of class members by not seeking compensatory damages on\n\ntheir behalf. In response, Jacobsen argued that he was not required to assert claims for\n\ncompensatory damages. He cited Lebrilla v. Farmers Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2292129\"><a href=\"/opinion/2292129/lebrilla-v-farmers-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal.\n\nApp. 4th Dist. 2004), for the proposition that there is no rule requiring a class representative\n\nto seek certification of all causes of action available to every member of the class. See\n\nLebrilla, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 40 (“Farmers is essentially asking us to hold a class cannot be\n\ncertified anytime the class representative fails to seek certification of fewer than all causes of\n\naction. Of course there is currently no such rule.”).\n\n¶115 Third, in its Order, the District Court recognized that there are “case-specific issues\n\npeculiar to individual claims” here. The court noted, for example, that whether liability for a\n\n                                               76\n\fgiven claim had become “reasonably clear,” see § 33-18-201(6), MCA, is “a highly\n\nindividualized, case-specific criteri[on].”4 The court noted the same thing with regard to\n\n“whether and to what extent individual class members ultimately received fair settlements.”\n\nThe existence of such factual variations among claimants subjected to the CCPR would\n\npreclude classwide adjudication of Allstate’s liability for damages under § 33-18-242(1),\n\nMCA. But the District Court did not construe this case as such an action. The court instead\n\nconstrued Jacobsen’s class claim to be that Allstate’s use of the CCPR violated\n\n§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, “irrespective of outcomes in individual cases.” The court\n\nobserved that “the class-wide matter at issue is the indivisible net effect of the Casualty\n\nCCPR unrepresented segment practices on the class as a whole, irrespective of individual\n\noutcomes.” Accordingly, setting aside the statute’s case-specific criteria, the District Court\n\nreasoned that “§§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, essentially require Allstate to promptly,\n\naccurately, truthfully, fairly, and in good faith adjust bodily injury and property damage\n\nclaims.” The court construed the class claim to be that Allstate’s use of the CCPR violates\n\nthese general principles of § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA.\n\n¶116 Fourth, the District Court recognized that Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize class\n\ncertification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of\n\nmonetary damages. The court thus framed “the dispositive Rule 23(b)(2) issues” as\n\n“(1) whether the asserted class claim seeks permissible forms of injunctive relief that will\n\n\n       4\n          Again, § 33-18-201(6), MCA, prohibits an insurer from “neglect[ing] to attempt in good\nfaith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become\n                                                77\n\fbenefit the class as a whole and (2) whether as a matter of law the requested forms of\n\nmonetary relief, however characterized, are permissible forms of Rule 23(b)(2) relief\n\nincidental to the predicate declaratory and injunctive relief from which they flow.” I discuss\n\nthe meaning of “incidental” monetary relief below. See ¶ 134, infra. For present purposes, it\n\nsuffices to note that it does not include individual claims for compensatory damages. The\n\nDistrict Court expressly rejected Allstate’s contention that the class action here would “serve\n\nonly to facilitate the award of damages.”\n\n¶117 Finally, consistent with the foregoing points, the District Court cited Title 27, chapter\n\n8, MCA (the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act), as authority for the first certified class\n\nremedy and Title 27, chapter 19, MCA (authorizing injunctions), as authority for the second\n\ncertified class remedy. The court did not rely on § 33-18-242, MCA, as authority for the\n\nclass claim or the class remedy. In fact, the District Court rejected the proposition that\n\nJacobsen’s class action is one that seeks “damages” under the UTPA:\n\n       Here, as construed by the court, Plaintiff’s asserted UTPA-based class claim\n       neither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages – it\n       merely encompasses first and third-party . . . claims for declaratory relief and\n       related equitable and punitive relief predicated on asserted class-wide\n       violations of §§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA.\n\nAllstate had pointed out in its brief opposing class certification that § 33-18-242, MCA,\n\nspecifically authorizes damages—compensatory and punitive—for an insurer’s violation of\n\nthe UTPA, not the equitable remedies that Jacobsen sought. See § 33-18-242(4), MCA.\n\nAllstate argued, therefore, that injunctive relief was not available to remedy the asserted\n\n\nreasonably clear.”\n                                              78\n\fclasswide violations of § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA. The District Court, however,\n\ninterpreted our decision in Ferguson as approving a class action “distinct from an\n\nindependent UTPA claim for damages under §§ 33-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.” The court\n\nconcluded that this case was such an action, i.e., “a UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action\n\nclaim for declaratory and derivative non-compensatory injunctive relief.”\n\n¶118 In sum, the District Court attempted to construe Jacobsen’s filings to assert a class\n\nclaim and class remedies that “minimally” satisfy the criteria of Rule 23(b)(2). The court\n\nrecognized that Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment\n\nwould provide relief to each member of the class, and that Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize\n\nclass certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of\n\nmonetary damages. Diaz, ¶ 42; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. Construing Jacobsen’s filings,\n\nthe District Court found that his “asserted UTPA-based class claim neither constitutes nor is\n\ntantamount to a claim for compensatory damages”; rather, what Jacobsen was asserting was\n\n“a UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action claim for declaratory and derivative non-\n\ncompensatory injunctive relief.” The District Court observed that this claim is “distinct from\n\nan independent UTPA claim for damages under §§ 33-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.”\n\n¶119 The class claim asserts what is in essence a facial challenge to the CCPR, alleging that\n\nthe CCPR is per se unlawful as to all unrepresented claimants and that Allstate’s use of the\n\nCCPR caused “indivisible harm to the class as a whole” as shown “by comparative analysis\n\nof relevant industry performance data and internal Allstate performance data.” Jacobsen\n\nexplained in the District Court that the claim “challenges Allstate’s systematic attempt to\n                                             79\n\fsettle claims below fair value.” In his view, “Allstate systematically promoted bad-faith\n\nadjusting and sought to undervalue claims.” Whether class members’ claims were, in fact,\n\nundervalued or settled unfairly is not the issue; the challenge is to Allstate’s alleged\n\n“systematic attempt” to settle claims below fair value. As Jacobsen further explains this\n\ntheory in his brief on appeal, Allstate used “settlement guidelines below the level needed to\n\nfairly compensate claimants” which caused class members “indivisible legal injury”; i.e.,\n\n“[a]ll members suffered legal injury through the use of a dishonest system, whether or not\n\nthe monetary value of each settlement ultimately was unfair.”\n\n¶120 Jacobsen and the District Court employ § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as the legal\n\nstandard for judging the CCPR’s validity, but without consideration of the case-specific\n\ncriteria contained in the statute (such as whether liability in a particular class member’s claim\n\nwas “reasonably clear”). Under this approach, the issues to be determined at the class trial\n\nare: whether the “attorney economics script” misrepresents facts; whether the “fast track”\n\nsystem and the “9-step process” are inherently incompatible with good-faith effectuation of\n\nprompt, fair, and equitable settlements; and whether use of these programs caused indivisible\n\nharm to the class as a whole. If using the CCPR enabled Allstate to outperform the industry,\n\nand if the CCPR is facially unlawful, then class members suffered an indivisible legal injury.\n\nThe proper remedy for this injury, the District Court determined, is injunctive relief\n\n“restoring interested class members and Allstate to the pre-settlement status quo.” This is\n\nthe class action that the District Court certified and that Allstate appealed to this Court.\n\n             II. This Court’s Remaking of the Class Claim and Remedies\n                                               80\n\f¶121 The Court, on its own initiative, fundamentally revises this framework. The Court\n\nbegins with the erroneous premise that the District Court formulated the class claim using the\n\n“indivisible harm to the class as a whole” language “so as to justify the entry of a class-wide\n\npunitive damages award.” Opinion, ¶ 47. That is simply incorrect. The District Court used\n\nthis language because indivisibility is what is needed to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2),\n\nDiaz, ¶ 42; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557, and because that is what Jacobsen had asserted in\n\nhis pleadings and arguments.\n\n¶122 Nevertheless, based on its mistaken assumption about the District Court’s intent, the\n\nCourt proceeds to revise the class claim as follows (underlining added):\n\n       As originally certified: “(B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern and\n       practice in Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its\n       zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship\n       between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole.”\n\n       As revised by the Court: “(B) Allstate’s common, systematic use of this pattern\n       and practice in Montana resulted in damages to the members of the class by operation\n       of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship\n       between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of\n       compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole.” Opinion,\n       ¶ 47.\n\nThe Court then, on its own initiative, augments the relief available to the class members. In\n\naddition to the declaratory and injunctive remedies certified by the District Court, the Court\n\nannounces that the class trial will “set the stage” for “individual monetary relief” in “later\n\nindividual trials.” Opinion, ¶¶ 43, 46, 49, 90. The Court explains that the class trial will\n\ndetermine Allstate’s liability for a UTPA violation, and the later individual trials will\n\n                                              81\n\fdetermine class members’ “compensatory damages.” Opinion, ¶¶ 49, 57, 66, 90. The Court\n\nalso announces that class members may seek relief for both “economic” and “emotional”\n\ninjury, Opinion, ¶ 55—something that Jacobsen never asserted, and that the District Court\n\nnever certified, in the Rule 23(b)(2) class claim and remedies.\n\n¶123 This gratuitous reworking of the case is in direct contradiction to the District Court’s\n\ncertification of this case as a class action “distinct from an independent UTPA claim for\n\ndamages under §§ 33-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.” It also contradicts the District Court’s\n\nstatement that, “as construed by the court, Plaintiff’s asserted UTPA-based class claim\n\nneither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages.” In fact, the only\n\nmonetary relief that Jacobsen discussed in his argument supporting class certification was\n\n“disgorgement of illicit profits from the unlawful [CCPR] program.” Acknowledging the\n\nlimitations of Rule 23(b)(2) certification, Jacobsen did not propose that the class action\n\nwould result in monetary damages under § 33-18-242, MCA. His theory, rather, was unjust\n\nenrichment—that Allstate had unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by\n\nusing patently unlawful claim settlement practices, as evidenced by Allstate’s ability to\n\noutperform the industry. The District Court accepted this theory, but found that an\n\ninjunction allowing class members to return to square one, rather than an injunction requiring\n\nAllstate to “disgorge illicit profits,” would be the proper remedy. The Court thus errs in\n\nreframing Jacobsen’s class claim as a springboard for future individual trials on damages.\n\nThe class claim, as construed and certified by the District Court, does not determine whether\n\nAllstate is liable for actual damages under the UTPA. The District Court did not certify a\n                                             82\n\fclass action under § 33-18-242, MCA; it certified a class action under Title 27, chapters 8\n\nand 19, MCA.\n\n¶124 “[A]ppellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but\n\nessentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.”\n\nNASA v.

The Court’s choice to remake this class action disregards this fundamental premise\n\nof our adversarial system. The Court’s citation to § 3-2-204(1), MCA—see Opinion, ¶ 47—\n\nis clearly misplaced. That provision simply grants this Court authority to “affirm, reverse, or\n\nmodify any judgment or order appealed from.” Section 3-2-204(1), MCA. It does not give\n\nthis Court authority to fundamentally remake the case to state claims and remedies that the\n\nappellee neither asserted in the district court nor raised in a cross-appeal before this Court.\n\nIronically, the Court uses the arguments of the appellant (Allstate) opposing class\n\ncertification as justification to revise the class claim and remedies in a way that exposes the\n\nappellant to significantly greater liability.\n\n             III. Flaws in the Court’s Remade Class Claim and Remedies\n\n¶125 Besides the questionable procedural aspect of the Court’s action, the remade class\n\nclaim and class remedies are flawed for additional reasons.\n\n¶126 First, as an initial matter, the Court’s Opinion is internally inconsistent. Pursuant to\n\nthe District Court’s Order, the class is seeking a declaratory judgment as to three issues:\n\n(A) that the CCPR violates § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as applied to the class of\n\nunrepresented claimants as a whole; (B) that Allstate’s systematic use of the CCPR “caused\n                                                83\n\findivisible harm to the class as a whole”; and (C) that Allstate acted with actual malice. See\n\n¶ 109, supra. Now, under the Court’s rewording of issue (B), the class is seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that Allstate’s systematic use of the CCPR “resulted in damages to the\n\nmembers of the class.” Opinion, ¶ 47. At the same time, however, the Court states\n\nrepeatedly that whether class members suffered damages is to be determined in later\n\nindividual trials. See Opinion, ¶ 46 (“Damages claims may be determined in later individual\n\ntrials after [the] class trial . . . .”), ¶ 57 (the specifics of a class member’s injuries will “be\n\naired in a later, individual suit for damages”), ¶ 66 (“The later individual trials would allow\n\nAllstate to present evidence that individual class members suffered no injury.”), ¶ 78 (“Here,\n\nadjudicating the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would not involve a . . .\n\ndetermination of compensatory damages.”), ¶ 90 (“the class members would be entitled to\n\nonly the compensatory damages they can prove in the individual cases”). Our Opinion\n\nleaves the District Court and the parties guessing as to how the fact-finder in the class trial is\n\nto determine whether Allstate’s use of the CCPR “resulted in damages to the members of the\n\nclass” when, under this Court’s decision, damages to the members of the class are to be\n\ndetermined in “later individual trials” at which Allstate may “present evidence that\n\nindividual class members suffered no injury.” The Court offers no explanation for this\n\nincongruity—an incongruity that arose out of the Court’s decision to insert “damages” into\n\nthe class claim.\n\n¶127 Second, the question whether Allstate’s use of the CCPR “resulted in damages to the\n\nmembers of the class” cannot be answered on a classwide basis in any event. A claimant is\n                                                84\n\fnot damaged under § 33-18-201(6), MCA, unless the insurer’s liability for the claim was\n\n“reasonably clear.” A claimant is not damaged under § 33-18-201(1), MCA, unless the\n\nmisrepresented facts were “pertinent” to coverages “at issue.” A claimant is not entitled to\n\ndamages under the UTPA unless the alleged damages were “proximately caused” by the\n\nUTPA violation. Section 33-18-242(4), MCA. A claimant is not entitled to damages under\n\nthe UTPA “if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or\n\nthe amount of the claim.” Section 33-18-242(5), MCA. These are all highly individualized,\n\ncase-specific criteria.\n\n¶128 Third, under the legal authority discussed above and in Justice Baker’s Dissent, class\n\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper where the requested injunctive or declaratory\n\nrelief would simply serve as a basis for eventually providing monetary relief. Dissent,\n\n¶¶ 97-99; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557 (“[Rule 23(b)(2)] does not authorize class\n\ncertification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of\n\nmonetary damages.”). I agree with Justice Baker’s analysis and conclusion that the Rule\n\n23(b)(2) class trial which the Court conceives in today’s Opinion is for the purpose of laying\n\na foundation for individualized awards of monetary damages. Dissent, ¶ 99. This approach\n\nis wholly inconsistent with Rule 23(b)(2)’s history and purpose.5 As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained:\n\n\n       5\n        Prior to 1962, a form of class action was permitted in Montana under § 93-2821, RCM\n(1947). This statute, originally enacted by the first territorial Legislature in 1864 as part of the\nBannack Statutes, simply provided that “when the question is one of a common or general interest,\nof many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before\n                                                85\n\f       Because Rule 23 “stems from equity practice” that predated its codification,\n       Amchem Products, Inc. v.

In particular, the Rule reflects a series of\n       decisions involving challenges to racial segregation—conduct that was\n       remedied by a single classwide order. In none of the cases cited by the\n       Advisory Committee as examples of (b)(2)’s antecedents did the plaintiffs\n       combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide injunction.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557-58 (brackets in original).\n\n¶129 Fourth, using class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) to “set the stage” for later\n\nindividual trials on compensatory damages, Opinion, ¶¶ 46, 49, 90, presents due process\n\nproblems. Classes certified under Rule 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) are “mandatory classes: The\n\nRule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even\n\noblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558;\n\nsee also M. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). Rule 23(b)(3), on the other hand,\n\n\n\nthe court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.” In 1961, the Legislature repealed\n§ 93-2821, RCM, and various other statutes and replaced them with the Montana Rules of Civil\nProcedure, which took effect on January 1, 1962. See Laws of Montana, 1961, ch. 13. Montana’s\nRule 23 was identical in all material respects to then-existing Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. In 1966, several of the federal rules were amended, including Rule 23.

In re Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, No. 10750-7 (Sep. 29,\n1967, filed Oct. 10, 1967). As noted in our order, the amendments to the Montana Rules were\n“patterned after either the 1963 or the 1966 amendments to the Federal Rules,” the rationale being\nthat it “would be desirable to maintain uniformity with the Federal Rules insofar as they are suitable\nto Montana practice.” In this regard, we adopted Federal Rule 23 in its entirety. In light of this\nbackground, the history of Federal Rule 23 is directly applicable and relevant to Montana Rule 23.\nSee also Sieglock v. Burlington N. Santa Fe Ry.

When a class seeks an\n       indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once, there is no reason to\n       undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate or\n       whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute.\n       Predominance and superiority are self-evident. But with respect to each class\n       member’s individualized claim for money, that is not so—which is precisely\n       why (b)(3) requires the judge to make findings about predominance and\n       superiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does not require that\n       class members be given notice and opt-out rights, presumably because it is\n       thought (rightly or wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is\n       mandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue in this manner\n       complies with the Due Process Clause. In the context of a class action\n\n       6\n         Phillips Petroleum held that an absent plaintiff is entitled to procedural due process\nprotection before he may be bound concerning a claim for money damages or similar relief at law.\nThe plaintiff must be given “notice,” “an opportunity to be heard and participate in the litigation,”\nand “an opportunity to remove himself from the class by executing and returning an ‘opt out’ or\n‘request for exclusion’ form to the court.” 472 U.S. at 811-12, 105 S. Ct. at 2974.\n                                                 87\n\f       predominantly for money damages we have held that absence of notice and\n       opt-out violates due process. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

While we have never held that to be so where the monetary\n       claims do not predominate, the serious possibility that it may be so provides an\n       additional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the monetary claims\n       here.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2558-59 (emphasis in original).\n\n¶131 That is precisely the problem the Court has created by transforming this case into a\n\nclass action under § 33-18-242, MCA. Apparently, Allstate’s liability to class members\n\nunder § 33-18-242(1), MCA, will be determined in a class trial, which will “set the stage” for\n\nlater individual trials on damages under § 33-18-242(4), MCA. Opinion, ¶¶ 49, 90. Because\n\nthis class action is certified under Rule 23(b)(2), the class is mandatory and the\n\npredominance, superiority, notice, and opt-out protections of Rule 23(b)(3) do not apply. If\n\nJacobsen loses on the merits, then the class members’ individual claims for damages will be\n\nseriously compromised, if not totally barred. See Randall v.

This approach of “depriving people of their right to sue” by\n\napproving a mandatory class absent notice and opt-out rights violates the Due Process\n\nClause. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2559.\n\n¶132 The fact that the class trial may also result in injunctive relief (in addition to the\n\ncompensatory damages the Court envisions in later individualized trials), Opinion, ¶ 90, does\n\nnot alter this conclusion. Even if injunctive relief is the “predominant” remedy,\n\n       [t]he mere “predominance” of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to\n       justify elimination of Rule 23(b)(3)’s procedural protections: It neither\n       establishes the superiority of class adjudication over individual adjudication\n       nor cures the notice and opt-out problems. We fail to see why the Rule should\n                                             88\n\f       be read to nullify these protections whenever a plaintiff class, at its option,\n       combines its monetary claims with a request—even a “predominating\n       request”—for an injunction.\n\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2559 (emphases in original); see also Ellis, 657 F.3d at 986-87.\n\n¶133 For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court errs in remaking this class action into one\n\nthat determines liability for damages under § 33-18-242, MCA. Before concluding this\n\ndiscussion, it is necessary to address McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2012), upon which the Court relies heavily. See Opinion, ¶¶ 41,\n\n42, 43, 45, 46, 57, 66. The plaintiffs in that case sought certification, under Rule 23(b)(2), to\n\ndetermine whether Merrill Lynch was engaged in practices that had a disparate impact on\n\nmembers of the class in violation of federal antidiscrimination law, and to provide\n\ncorresponding injunctive relief. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483. The plaintiffs also sought\n\ncertification, under Rule 23(b)(3), for compensatory and punitive damages; however, such\n\ncertification was not at issue on appeal. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 483. The issues were\n\nwhether the plaintiffs could obtain interlocutory review of the district court’s certification\n\ndecision and whether, under Wal-Mart, Merrill Lynch’s delegation of decision-making\n\nauthority to local managers precluded certification of a classwide claim for injunctive relief.\n\nMcReynolds, 672 F.3d at 484-91. The Court of Appeals (speaking through Judge Posner)\n\nnoted that “the only issue of relief at present is whether to allow the plaintiffs to seek class-\n\nwide injunctive relief” under Rule 23(b)(2).

Then,\n\nnear the end of the opinion, Judge Posner opined that if the classwide issue were ultimately\n                                               89\n\fresolved in the plaintiffs’ favor (i.e., with a finding that Merrill Lynch’s policies cause racial\n\ndiscrimination and are not justified by business necessity), then there could be hundreds of\n\nseparate suits for back pay. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 492. He did not hold, however, as the\n\nCourt implies, that Rule 23(b)(2) may be used as an integral component of a larger damages\n\naction. Indeed, such a holding would have been inconsistent with Seventh Circuit precedent.\n\n¶134 In Randall, the Court of Appeals (again speaking through Judge Posner) rejected the\n\nplaintiffs’ attempt to cloak a damages action in a Rule 23(b)(2) certification. Judge Posner\n\nobserved that “[c]lass action lawyers like to sue under [Rule 23(b)(2)] because it is less\n\ndemanding, in a variety of ways, than Rule 23(b)(3) suits, which usually are the only\n\navailable alternative. Of particular significance, plaintiffs may attempt to shoehorn damages\n\nactions into the Rule 23(b)(2) framework, depriving class members of notice and opt-out\n\nprotections.” Randall, 637 F.3d at 825 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nJudge Posner noted that it may be permissible in a Rule 23(b)(2) action to grant monetary\n\nrelief that is incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief, but he cautioned that\n\n“incidental” here means “requiring only a mechanical computation,” Randall, 637 F.3d at\n\n825; in other words, “the calculation of monetary relief will be mechanical, formulaic, a task\n\nnot for a trier of fact but for a computer program,” Johnson v. Meriter Health Servs.\n\nEmployee Ret.

Judge\n\nPosner explained in Randall that the plaintiffs’ monetary claims for back pay were not\n\n“incidental” under this definition because\n\n       calculating the amount of back pay to which the members of the class would\n       be entitled if the plaintiffs prevailed would require 500 separate hearings. The\n       monetary tail would be wagging the injunction dog. An injunction thus\n       “would not provide ‘final’ relief as required by Rule 23(b)(2). An injunction\n       is not a final remedy if it would merely lay an evidentiary foundation for\n       subsequent determinations of liability.”\n\n637 F.3d at 826 (quoting Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204668\"><a href=\"/opinion/204668/kartman-v-state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">883</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 893 (7th\n\nCir. 2011)).\n\n¶135 Kartman likewise undercuts this Court’s reliance on McReynolds. In the remade class\n\naction devised by the Court, the class trial is to determine whether Allstate violated the\n\nUTPA, and if a violation is found, then “compensatory damages” for “economic” and\n\n“emotional” injuries and “underpayment” of benefits is to be adjudicated in later individual\n\ntrials. Opinion, ¶¶ 49, 55, 68, 90. In the later individual trials, Allstate may present evidence\n\nthat individual class members suffered no injury. Opinion, ¶ 66. Thus, it may turn out that\n\nAllstate is liable in damages to some class members and not others. Under this scheme,\n\n“[Allstate’s] liability cannot be determined on a class-wide basis, but instead requires\n\nindividualized factual inquiries into the merits of each [class member’s] claim.” Kartman,\n\n\n\n\nacknowledged that the Ninth Circuit has expressed doubt about this in Ellis, 657 F.3d at 986.\n                                               91\n\f634 F.3d at 893. That is not a proper use of Rule 23(b)(2). Reviewing a similar scheme, the\n\nKartman court observed:\n\n       The [district court] judge said he would use the Rule 23(b)(2) proceeding to\n       assess State Farm’s “liability” on the damages claims. Perhaps by this the\n       judge meant that he intended to use the Rule 23(b)(2) class proceeding to\n       adjudicate only those common issues pertaining to State Farm’s liability for\n       breach of contract and bad faith, while reserving the more claimant-specific\n       issues—such as the calculation of damages—for subsequent individual\n       adjudication. However, as we have explained, Rule 23(b)(2) governs class\n       claims for final injunctive or declaratory relief and is not appropriately\n       invoked for adjudicating common issues in an action for damages. A damages\n       class may be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) and particular issues identified for\n       resolution on a class-wide basis pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4). Or, in an\n       appropriate case, a Rule 23(b)(2) class and a Rule 23(b)(3) class may be\n       certified where there is a real basis for both damages and an equitable remedy.\n        As we have explained, that is not the case here; neither Rule 23(b)(3) nor\n       Rule 23(c)(4) is implicated.\n\nKartman, 634 F.3d at 895 (emphases in original, citations omitted); see also e.g. Jamie S. v.\n\nMilwaukee Pub. Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 (7th Cir. 2012) (“a claim for class-wide injunctive\n\nand declaratory relief does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) if as a substantive matter the relief\n\nsought would merely initiate a process through which highly individualized determinations\n\nof liability and remedy are made”). McReynolds did not overrule these precedents, and this\n\nCourt misreads the McReynolds opinion in suggesting otherwise.\n\n¶136 For the reasons noted by the Court and Justice Baker, Rule 23(b)(3) is unavailable to\n\nJacobsen as a basis for certifying a class action. Opinion, ¶ 62; Dissent, ¶ 100. His class\n\nclaim is valid, if at all, under Rule 23(b)(2) only. In this regard, setting aside my concerns\n\nabout commonality, typicality, and adequacy (discussed below), the District Court construed\n\nJacobsen’s filings to assert a plausible Rule 23(b)(2) class action—one that determines\n                                             92\n\fwhether the program at issue (the CCPR) is per se invalid as to all class members, and that\n\nprovides a single injunction allowing all class members (in the event the CCPR is found\n\nunlawful) to have their claims re-opened and re-adjusted. Jacobsen’s class claim, the District\n\nCourt found, is “a UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action claim for declaratory and\n\nderivative non-compensatory injunctive relief”; it “neither constitutes nor is tantamount to a\n\nclaim for compensatory damages.” Seventh Circuit precedent, including McReynolds, does\n\nnot support our converting this Rule 23(b)(2) action for narrow injunctive relief into a broad\n\nRule 23(b)(3) action for compensatory damages—particularly without the procedural\n\nprotections that attend a Rule 23(b)(3) certification. If anything, the cases cited above\n\nrepudiate this approach.\n\n¶137 In sum, the Court’s remade class claim and class remedies are, in my view: contrary\n\nto the District Court’s construction of Jacobsen’s claim; internally inconsistent; incapable of\n\nbeing determined on a classwide basis; not proper for certification under Rule 23(b)(2); and\n\nviolative of class members’ due process rights. For all of these reasons, I cannot join the\n\nCourt’s Opinion.\n\n                              IV. Rule 23(a) Requirements\n\n¶138 As a final matter, I briefly discuss my concerns relating to the requirements of\n\nRule 23(a).\n\n¶139 First, I believe the Court should definitively state what standard is to be applied when\n\nassessing commonality under Rule 23(a)(2). Opinion, ¶¶ 33, 50 (declining to resolve this\n\nquestion). The Court, and Justice Baker in her Dissent, acknowledge confusion in our\n                                              93\n\fcaselaw regarding this issue. Despite “this Court’s long history of relying on federal\n\njurisprudence when interpreting the class certification requirements of Rule 23,” Chipman v.\n\nN.W.

We have avoided the\n\nissue here, as we did in Mattson III, by indicating that the more stringent Wal-Mart standard\n\nwas satisfied in any event. Opinion, ¶¶ 33, 50; Mattson III, ¶ 37. Yet, evaluating the\n\npropriety of the District Court’s decision pursuant to Wal-Mart, and conducting our own\n\nexhaustive analysis under the Wal-Mart standard, without definitively setting forth our\n\nstandard of review, emphasizes the need for us to provide direction in this area of law.\n\nWithout guidance, this issue will likely be raised repeatedly in the district courts. And,\n\nabsent our directive to the contrary, it is likely that district courts will continue to assess\n\ncommonality under the more stringent Wal-Mart standard, as fewer issues are left to be\n\nraised on appeal. The District Court here analyzed the facts and law pursuant to Wal-Mart.\n\nThe Court today has similarly conducted its analysis pursuant to Wal-Mart. The question\n\nstill remains, however, as to whether the Wal-Mart standard is the controlling standard in\n\nMontana. While I understand the necessity for robust adversarial argument and briefing, as\n\nwell as an appropriate factual scenario, I think litigants and the trial courts need a definitive\n\n\n                                               94\n\fstatement from this Court as to what standard is to be used. I believe the Court does the\n\nbench and bar a disservice in neglecting to address the appropriate standard to apply.\n\n¶140 Second, I do not believe that the class claim here—neither the one certified by the\n\nDistrict Court nor the one remade by this Court—satisfies the commonality requirement of\n\nRule 23(a)(2). In my view, there are no questions of law or fact common to the class.\n\nJacobsen’s class claim is that the CCPR is per se invalid under subsections (1) and (6) of\n\n§ 33-18-201, MCA. These two subsections, however, demand consideration of highly\n\nindividualized, case-specific criteria. The District Court recognized this, but concluded that\n\na common question of law or fact could be formulated for the class by essentially setting\n\naside the case-specific criteria of subsections (1) and (6) and evaluating the CCPR’s validity\n\nbased on the general principles embodied in these two provisions. As discussed, the District\n\nCourt reasoned that “§§ 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, essentially require Allstate to promptly,\n\naccurately, truthfully, fairly, and in good faith adjust bodily injury and property damage\n\nclaims.” The District Court construed the class claim to be that Allstate’s use of the CCPR\n\nviolates these general principles, “irrespective of individual outcomes.”            This Court\n\napparently adopts the same analysis. Opinion, ¶ 40.\n\n¶141 I question this approach of evaluating the validity of the CCPR—or any other\n\nsettlement practice, for that matter—under § 33-18-201, MCA, based on certain criteria that\n\nare selectively plucked from the statute, while ignoring other criteria in the statute. It strikes\n\nme that this approach violates the cardinal rule that, “[i]n the construction of a statute, the\n\noffice of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance\n                                               95\n\fcontained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.”\n\nSection 1-2-101, MCA. The Legislature crafted the various subsections of § 33-18-201,\n\nMCA, to address specific settlement practices. Subsection (1) states that an insurer may not\n\n“misrepresent pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.”\n\nSubsection (6) states that an insurer may not “neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate\n\nprompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably\n\nclear.” I do not subscribe to the view that the fact-finder in a class trial can determine\n\nwhether the CCPR is per se invalid under subsections (1) and (6)—as to all class members—\n\nby simply disregarding the individualized inquiry plainly required by the statute as to such\n\nquestions as whether liability had become reasonably clear, whether the allegedly\n\nmisrepresented facts were pertinent to coverages at issue, and whether Allstate had a\n\nreasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim (see\n\n§ 33-18-242(5), MCA).\n\n¶142 I do not mean to suggest that no class action is possible under § 33-18-201, MCA. I\n\ndo believe, however, that the supposed common question here—whether Allstate’s use of the\n\nCCPR violates § 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA—cannot be answered for an entire class of\n\nclaimants. Whether Allstate deliberately crafted the CCPR in such a way as to avoid review\n\non a classwide basis (an allegation that surfaced in the District Court proceedings) is beside\n\nthe point. Our duty here is to ascertain whether, under the criteria of § 33-18-201(1) and (6),\n\nMCA, there is a question of law or fact that “is capable of classwide resolution—which\n\nmeans that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the\n                                              96\n\fvalidity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. In my view,\n\nthere is no such common question, and I thus would hold that commonality, under Rule\n\n23(a)(2), is not met.\n\n¶143 Third, I also share Justice Baker’s concerns about whether Jacobsen meets the\n\ntypicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) and (4). Dissent, ¶ 96 n. 2. The\n\nnamed plaintiff’s claim will be typical of the class where there is a nexus between the injury\n\nsuffered by the plaintiff and the injury suffered by the class. McDonald v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1156 (1993). Such nexus normally exists where proving the\n\nnamed plaintiff’s claim will necessarily prove all class members’ claims. McDonald, 261\n\nMont. at 402, 862 P.2d at 1156.\n\n¶144 Here, Jacobsen does not contend that the amount of his settlement was unfair or\n\ninequitable or that his claim was not promptly resolved. Section 33-18-201(6), MCA.\n\nMoreover, he cannot claim that Allstate, through the CCPR’s “attorney economics script,”\n\nmisrepresented pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue to\n\nJacobsen’s detriment, § 33-18-201(1), MCA, given that he actually consulted and retained\n\ncounsel who assisted him with settling his claim. Jacobsen’s claim was adjusted to a\n\nrepresented settlement. He therefore is not a member of the class, which is defined as all\n\nunrepresented claimants “whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana to an\n\nunrepresented settlement since deployment” of the CCPR. Jacobsen has already had his\n\nclaim re-opened and re-adjusted for payment of additional settlement amounts for his bodily\n\ninjury claim. Consequently, he cannot have his claim re-opened. Further, Jacobsen no\n                                              97\n\flonger pursues a property damage claim, which is included in the class definition, and he is a\n\nthird-party claimant seeking emotional distress damages.            He thus would not be\n\nrepresentative of first-party claimants or those claimants with property damage. Lastly,\n\nJacobsen’s claims will be subject to unique defenses, not the least of which are: different\n\nstatutes of limitations for first- and third-party claims; his admission that he spoke to an\n\nattorney but chose not to hire one; the basis of his emotional distress; and his desire to have\n\nan early settlement. I thus would hold that Jacobsen’s claims are not typical and that he is\n\nnot an adequate representative of the class under Rule 23(a)(3) and (4), respectively.\n\n                                       V. Conclusion\n\n¶145 In conclusion, I believe the Court has wrongly remade this case into an action for\n\ndamages under the UTPA (§ 33-18-242, MCA) and, in so doing, has distorted the rules for\n\ncertifying a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and jeopardized class members’ due process rights. I\n\nfurther believe that the Rule 23(a) requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequacy are\n\nnot met here. For all of the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n                                                   /S/ LAURIE McKINNON\n\n\n\n\n                                              98\n\f</pre>",
