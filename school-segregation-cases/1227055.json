Rule of Jud. Admin. 2.420 &amp; Fla. Rules of App. Pro.,</i> 31 So.3d 756, 757 (Fla.2010) (recognizing that refinement of rule governing confidential court records was a necessary step in providing the public electronic access to court records).</p>\n<p>The amendments at issue here further implement recommendations of the Committee on Privacy and Court Records (Privacy Committee) and are the result of the combined efforts of the Committee on Access to Court Records (Access Committee), its successor, the Florida Court Technology Commission's Subcommittee on Access to Court Records (Access Subcommittee),<sup>[3]</sup> and the Florida Bar Rules Committees. After considering the various proposals and comments filed in this case, and hearing oral argument, we amend the rules and forms to minimize the personal information filed with the court. Most notably, we adopt new Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425 (Minimization of the Filing of Sensitive Information) to govern the filing of sensitive personal information, which is the linchpin of the minimization efforts. We take this opportunity to emphasize that in order to avoid the electronic dissemination of sensitive personal information unnecessary to court proceedings, both attorneys and pro se litigants must be vigilant to file only authorized documents that comply with the requirements adopted here.</p>\n<p>The newly enacted rules provide for sanctions for violations of these rules. However, continual education and a change in mindset for all those involved in the litigation process are necessary for these rules to work as intended. After all, with the benefits of electronic access to documents comes the responsibility to minimize unnecessary personal information in court records. With those beginning cautions, we explain the evolution of the amendments and the substance of the major amendments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The Privacy Committee was created in November 2003 and charged with providing recommendations to the Court regarding electronic access to court records. <i>See In re Comm. on Privacy and Court Records,</i> Fla. Admin. Order No. AOSC04-04 (Feb. 12, 2004) (substituted for AOSC03-49). As relevant to the amendments at issue here, the Privacy Committee was charged with recommending strategies for reducing the amount of unnecessary personal information in court records. <i>Id.</i> at 5. After the Privacy Committee submitted its report and recommendations<sup>[4]</sup> and the Court held public hearings on the recommendations, an administrative order was issued partially implementing the Privacy Committee's recommendations.<sup>[5]</sup> That administrative order noted the Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> agreement with the Privacy Committee that the Florida judicial branch should have a goal of providing electronic access to nonconfidential court records when appropriate conditions are met, one of which is minimizing the amount of unnecessary personal information in court records.<sup>[6]</sup> By separate administrative order, the Access Committee was created to assist the Court in implementing a number of the Privacy Committee recommendations,<sup>[7]</sup> including the \"minimization\" recommendations addressed here.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>As relevant here, the Privacy Committee reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Florida court files commonly contain information which is not required by law or rule and which is not needed by the court for purposes of adjudication or case management. Once entered into a court file this information becomes a matter of public record. Much of this information is personal or sensitive in nature. The Committee perceives that there is not a clear understanding on the part of attorneys and the general public of the negative effects on personal privacy of placing unnecessary information in a court record.</blockquote>\n<p>Privacy Committee Report at 56. The inclusion of unnecessary personal information in court filings is of special concern because providing electronic access, which would include internet access, to court records will make nonconfidential personal information contained in those records more readily accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this concern, the Privacy Committee made four recommendations intended to minimize the filing of extraneous personal information. Privacy Committee Recommendation Seven urges the review and revision of court rules and forms to avoid the filing of personal information that is not necessary for adjudication or case management.<sup>[9]</sup> Recommendation Eight recommends the study of a court rule to prohibit the filing of unauthorized documents.<sup>[10]</sup> Recommendation Nine suggests clarifying Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.285 (Mandatory Disclosure) to avoid the unnecessary filing of financial information in family law cases.<sup>[11]</sup> And Recommendation Ten urges the adoption of a rule that prohibits the filing of discovery information with the court unless the information is filed for good cause and that provides for sanctions if the rule is violated.<sup>[12]</sup> These \"minimization\" recommendations were referred to the Florida Bar rules committees to propose rule and form amendments implementing the recommendations.<sup>[13]</sup> The rules committees' proposals <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> were then referred to the Access Committee for consideration<sup>[14]</sup> and preparation of an omnibus petition of proposed rule amendments. The Access Committee's petition of proposed amendments, as well as revised and new proposals offered by the rules committees are before the Court here.</p>\n<p>In considering the proposals, the Court had the benefit of comments from interested persons, as well as responses and input from the Access Subcommittee (successor to the Access Committee)<sup>[15]</sup> and the various rules committees on a number of issues of concern to the Court. <i>See In re Implementation of Comm. on Privacy &amp; Court Records Recommendations,</i> No. SC08-2443 (Fla. order filed April 1, 2010) (seeking input on a number of issues); <i>see also In re Implementation of Comm. on Privacy &amp; Court Records Recommendations,</i> No. SC08-2443 (Fla. order filed May 19, 2010) (seeking input on suggested new rule 2.425). In response to the Court's concern about consistency among the various rules proposed to govern the filing of sensitive personal information, the committees now urge the adoption of new Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425 (Minimization of the Filing of Sensitive Information) and conforming amendments to the other bodies of rules and forms.</p>\n<p>After considering the various proposals, we amend the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Florida Probate Rules, the Florida Small Claims Rules, the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure and forms, as reflected in the appendix to this opinion. We discuss the more significant amendments below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>AMENDMENTS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>New Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425 and Other Amendments Limiting the Filing of Extraneous Personal Information</h2>\n<p>New rule 2.425 (Minimization of the Filing of Sensitive Information) is the centerpiece of the amendments adopted in this case. The new rule governs the filing of sensitive personal information in all types of cases, except traffic and criminal proceedings.<sup>[16]</sup> It implements Privacy Committee Recommendation Seven, which urges revision of court rules and forms to avoid the filing of personal information that is not necessary for adjudication or case management.<sup>[17]</sup> The new rule of judicial administration sets forth the categories of personal information that must not be filed or must be truncated or redacted before filing, and provides exceptions that allow for the filing of complete information in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p>The new rule serves as a companion to recently amended Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 (Public Access to Judicial Branch Records).<sup>[18]</sup> New rule 2.425 provides <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> the procedures for protecting personal information being filed with the court; while rule 2.420 governs the procedures for determining the confidentiality of information after it has been filed and for providing public access to nonconfidential information. Rule 2.425 is loosely modeled after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 (Privacy Protection for Filings Made with the Court). The most important provisions of the new rule are discussed below.</p>\n<p>First, under subdivision (a) (Limitations for Court Filings) of the new rule, unless exempted by subdivision (b) (Exceptions), or authorized by statute, another rule, or court order,<sup>[19]</sup> personal information of the type listed either must not be filed or must be truncated or redacted before filing. Under subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) only the initials of a minor and the year of birth of a person's birth date may be included in filings, and under subdivision (a)(3), no portion of a social security number, bank account number, credit card account number, charge account number, or debit account number can be filed,<sup>[20]</sup> unless the number falls within one of the subdivision (b) exceptions, or is authorized by statute, another rule, or court order.</p>\n<p>Only the last four digits of certain other personal identifying numbers (i.e., driver's license number, passport number, taxpayer identification number, and patient or health care number) are allowed under subdivision (a)(4). Similarly, a truncated version of other types of personal information (i.e., email address, password, and other sensitive information as provided by court order) is allowed under subdivisions (a)(5) and (a)(6).</p>\n<p>Next, subdivision (b) (Exceptions) allows for the filing of complete information under certain circumstances. For example, under subdivisions (b)(1), (b)(5), and (b)(6) respectively, an account number that identifies the property alleged to be the subject of a proceeding, the birth date of a minor whenever the birth date is necessary for the court to establish or maintain subject matter jurisdiction, and the name of a minor in any document or order affecting the minor's ownership of real property are exempt from the subdivision (a) limitations. Under subdivision (b)(10), information that is relevant and material to an issue before the court also is exempt.</p>\n<p>Subdivision (b)(8), which we adopt on an interim basis, exempts from the requirements of the rule filings in traffic and criminal proceedings. This exception is strongly supported by the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee, prosecutors, and defense attorneys, as well as numerous Florida criminal justice organizations.<sup>[21]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1051</span> The Rules Committee and criminal justice organizations maintain that much of the information filed in criminal cases that would have to be truncated or redacted under the new rule must be available to defense attorneys, law enforcement, and others in the criminal justice system. The proponents of the exception also caution that application of the rule would result in substantial workload issues for prosecutors' offices that would be required to truncate or redact massive amounts of information routinely contained in arrest affidavits, search warrants, charging documents, traffic citations, police reports, and discovery documents filed with the court. We acknowledge the reasons advanced for treating filings in criminal and traffic proceedings differently than filings in other cases. However, filings in criminal and traffic cases contain a large portion of the personal information filed with our courts and a \"blanket\" exception for those filings would not be necessary if a finely tailored rule can be drafted to govern them. Therefore, we direct the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee, the Traffic Court Rules Committee, and the Rules of Judicial Administration Committee to work together to propose a rule or rules similar to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 49.1 (Privacy Protection for Filings Made with the Court) to govern the filing of sensitive personal information in criminal and traffic proceedings.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, subdivision (c) (Remedies) provides remedies and sanctions for violations of the rule. And subdivisions (d) (Motions Not Restricted) and (e) (Application) clarify the new rule's interplay with rule 2.420 (Public Access to Judicial Branch Records) and explain that the new rule does not affect the application of constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of court governing confidential information or access to public records.</p>\n<p>Other rules of procedure and forms are amended to conform to or reference new rule 2.425.<sup>[23]</sup> For example, new Rule of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1052</span> Appellate Procedure 9.050 (Maintaining Privacy of Personal Data) requires all briefs, petitions, replies, appendices, motions, notices, stipulations, and responses filed with the court comply with rule 2.425. Family Law Rules 12.130(c) (Protection of Account and Personal Identifying Numbers), 12.440(a) (Setting for Trial), 12.540 (Relief from Judgment, Decrees, or Orders), and 12.620 (Receivers) are amended to require compliance with rule 2.425. Amendments to the civil and family law discovery rules also incorporate the requirements of rule 2.425. <i>See</i> Appendix, <i>infra,</i> pp. 1055-57, 1074-78 (amending Fla. R. Civil P. 1.280; 1.310; 1.340; 1.350; Fla. Fam. L.R.P. 12.280; 12.285; 12.340; 12.370; 12.410; 12.560).</p>\n<p>To further implement Privacy Committee Recommendation Seven (Revision of Rules and Forms Leading to Extraneous Personal Information), the various civil judgment forms are amended to require that only the last four digits of the judgment debtor's social security number be included in the judgment. Probate Rules 5.200 (Petition for Administration), 5.210 (Probate of Wills without Administration), and 5.530 (Summary Administration) are likewise amended to require that only the last four digits of the decedent's social security number be included in petitions filed under those rules.<sup>[24]</sup> Similarly, to limit the filing of personal information in criminal cases, Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.140(c)(4) (Personal Statistics) is amended to delete the requirement that the defendant's social security number be included in the charging document.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(f) and Other Amendments Limiting the Filing of Discovery and Financial Information</h2>\n<p>New Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(f) (Court Filing of Documents and Discovery) works in conjunction with new rule 2.425, by requiring that all discovery documents filed with the court comply with the requirements for the filing of personal information. However, the new discovery rule's primary purpose is to implement Privacy Committee Recommendation Ten,<sup>[26]</sup> by prohibiting the filing of information obtained during discovery unless the information is filed for good cause and giving the court authority to impose sanctions for violation of the rule. The Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1053</span> revised the language of proposed rule 1.280(f) to clarify that good cause is satisfied only where the filing of the information is allowed or required by another applicable rule of procedure or by court order. This requirement is intended to stop abuses of personal information obtained during discovery by preventing the filing of discovery information unless it is necessary to the proceedings. Other civil discovery rules are amended to require compliance with new rule 1.280(f). <i>See</i> Appendix, <i>infra,</i> pp. 1055-57 (amending Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.310; 1.340; 1.350).</p>\n<p>Family law discovery rules also are amended to limit the filing of discovery information. New subdivision (c) is added to Family Law Rule 12.340 (Interrogatories to Parties) to require that responses to interrogatories be served but not filed with the court, unless they are admitted into evidence and are in compliance with rule 2.425. Rule 12.370 (Requests for Admissions) is amended to require that documents attached to a request for admissions be served with the request but not filed with the court. The amendments to rule 12.560 (Discovery in Aid of Execution) prohibits the filing of a fact information sheet, civil form 1.977, unless ordered by the court for good cause shown.</p>\n<p>Similarly, subdivisions (b) and (e) of rule 12.363 (Evaluations of Minor Child) are amended to prevent the filing of an evaluation of a minor child unless the report is being admitted into evidence. If the report is filed, the filing must comply with rule 2.425. The Media Organizations<sup>[27]</sup> that commented on these amendments urge us to reject the requirement, added to subdivision (e), that the court consider whether the report should be sealed under rule 2.420. The Media Organizations maintain that rule 2.420 places the burden of seeking a determination of confidentiality of court records on the proponent of closure, not the court. In response, the Family Law Rules Committee points out that the court has inherent authority to protect the interests of children whose parents are before the court, citing <i>Simms v. State Department of Health &amp; Rehabilitative Services,</i> 641 So.2d 957, 961 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994). The Access Subcommittee explains that the recent amendments to rule 2.420 were not intended to affect the power of a court to determine, sua sponte, that a particular court record is confidential. Therefore, we defer to the committee and adopt the subdivision (e) requirement.</p>\n<p>Next, to implement Privacy Committee Recommendation Nine, which requested that the mandatory disclosure rule be clarified to avoid the unnecessary filing of financial information in family law cases,<sup>[28]</sup> as well as Recommendations Seven and Ten, we adopt new Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.285(a)(3) (Mandatory Disclosure; Documents Not to be Filed with Court; Sanctions), and amend rule 12.287 (Financial Affidavits in Enforcement and Contempt Proceedings). New rule 12.285(a)(3)(A) highlights language currently in the rule stating that except for financial affidavits and child support guidelines worksheets, documents produced under the rule are not to be filed with the court absent a court order. Subdivision (a)(3)(B) requires that account numbers and personal identifying information are governed by rule 2.425. And subdivision (a)(3)(C) provides that sanctions are governed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1054</span> by new rule 1.280(f). New rule 12.285(c) (Exemption for Requirement to File and Serve Financial Affidavit) prohibits the filing and service of a financial affidavit if the parties are seeking a simplified dissolution of marriage under 12.105 and certain conditions are met. The current rule 12.105(c) requirement that the parties to a simplified dissolution proceeding file a financial affidavit and marital settlement agreement is deleted, and the family law forms are amended accordingly. Rule 12.287 is amended to delete the requirement that a requested financial affidavit be filed with the court in enforcement and contempt proceedings and to add a requirement that a notice of compliance with the service requirement be filed instead.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>The family law rules of procedure forms are amended to conform with the amendments to the family law rules. Additionally, the instructions to several of the rules forms and approved forms are amended to conform to section 119.071(2)(j)(1), Florida Statutes (2010), which was enacted to protect the confidentiality of victims of domestic violence, sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, and aggravated battery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Amendments to Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms</h2>\n<p>Finally, with input from the Court's Advisory Workgroup on the Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms,<sup>[30]</sup> we amend the Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms to ensure that the forms do not prompt those who use them to provide unnecessary personal information, such as \"place of marriage,\" \"date of separation,\" \"place of birth of minor children,\" or \"gender of minor children.\" The requirement to include a statement of the \"best interest of the child(ren)\" is deleted from form 12.905(d) (Supplemental Petition for Temporary Modification of Parenting Issues for Child(ren) of Parent Activated, Deployed, or Temporarily Assigned to Military Service), as unnecessary. Requests for financial information that is required to be provided in the family financial affidavits also is removed from form 12.943 (Motion to Deviate from Child Support Guidelines). Other more minor changes also are made to the approved forms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We thank the Access Committee, the Access Subcommittee, the Florida Bar Rules Committees, the Court's Advisory Workgroup on the Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms, and those who submitted comments for assisting the Court in moving closer to our goal of providing the public with electronic access to court records. We also take this opportunity to emphasize that in order to avoid the electronic dissemination of sensitive personal information unnecessary to court proceedings, both attorneys and pro se litigants must be vigilant to file only authorized documents that comply with the requirements adopted here.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we amend the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Florida Probate Rules, the Florida Small Claims Rules, the Florida Rules of Appellate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1055</span> Procedure, and the Florida Family Law Rules as reflected in the appendix to this opinion.<sup>[31]</sup> New language is indicated by underscoring; deletions are indicated by struck-through type. The committee notes are offered for explanation only and are not adopted as an official part of the rules. We also amend the Family Law Rules of Procedure Forms and the Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms, as set forth in the appendix to this opinion, fully engrossed for use on the effective date of the amendments. The forms can be accessed and downloaded from this Court's website at www.flcourts. org/gen_public/family/forms_rules/index. shtml. By adopting the amended forms, we express no opinion as to their correctness or applicability.</p>\n<p>The amendments to the rules and forms are effective, nunc pro tunc, October 1, 2011, at 12:01 a.m.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>CANADY, C.J., and PARIENTE, LEWIS, POLSTON, LABARGA, and PERRY, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p>QUINCE, J., concurs in result.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FLORIDA RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>RULE 1.280.

You and/or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing for a dissolution in Florida. You may file a simplified dissolution of marriage in Florida if all of the following are true:</p>\n<blockquote>Â• You and your spouse agree that the marriage cannot be saved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• You and your spouse have no minor or dependent child(ren) together, the wife <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1079</span> does not have any minor or dependent children born during the marriage, and the wife is not now pregnant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• You and your spouse have worked out how the two of you will divide the things that you both own (your assets) and who will pay what part of the money you both owe (your liabilities), and you are both satisfied with this division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• You are not seeking support (alimony) from your spouse, and vice versa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• You and your spouse have filed financial affidavits with the court or you have waived the filing of financial affidavits and you are satisfied with the financial disclosure received from the other spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• You are willing to give up your right to trial and appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• You and your spouse are both willing to go into the clerk's office to sign the petition (not necessarily together).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• You and your spouse are both willing to go to the final hearing (at the same time).</blockquote>\n<p>If you do not meet the criteria above, you must file a regular petition for dissolution of marriage.</p>\n<p>This petition should be typed or printed in black ink. Each of you must sign the petition in the presence of a deputy clerk (in the clerk's office), although you do not have to go into the clerk's office at the same time. You will need to provide picture identification (valid driver's license or official identification card) for the clerk to witness your signatures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>1. After completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<blockquote>If you did not waive the filing of a financial affidavit in the petition, each of you must file a Financial Affidavit. Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). You may document your agreement by signing a Marital Settlement Agreement, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(f)(3) and filing it with the clerk of the circuit court or you may agree that all of your assets (what you own) and liabilities (what you owe) have been disposed of by oral agreement.</blockquote>\n<p>2. You must prove to the court that the husband and/or wife has (have) lived in Florida for more than 6 months before filing the petition for dissolution of marriage. Residence can be proved by:</p>\n<blockquote>Â• a valid Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter registration card issued to one of you at least 6 months prior to filing for dissolution of marriage; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• the testimony of another person who knows that either you or your spouse has resided in Florida for more than 6 months and is available to testify in court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• an affidavit. To prove residence by affidavit, use an Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i). This form must be signed by a person who knows that either you or your spouse has lived in Florida for more than 6 months before the date that you filed the petition for dissolution of marriage. This affidavit may be signed in the presence of the clerk of the court or in the presence of a notary public, who must affix his or her seal at the proper place on the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p>3. You must pay the appropriate filing fees to the clerk of the circuit court. If you and your spouse cannot afford to pay <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1080</span> the filing fees, you may fill out an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status, and file it with your petition for dissolution of marriage. You may obtain this form from the clerk and he or she will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees waived.</p>\n<p>4. Either you or the clerk of court will need to complete a Family Court Cover Sheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.928. The clerk's office can provide this form.</p>\n<p>5. You must obtain a date and time for a court appearance from the clerk of court. On that date, you and your spouse must appear together before a judge. You should complete a Final Judgment of Simplified Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.990(a), and bring it with you to the hearing. At that time, if all of the papers are in order, the judge may grant a final judgment dissolving your marriage under simplified dissolution of marriage procedures by signing the final judgment which you have provided.</p>\n<p>6. If you fail to complete this procedure, the court may dismiss the case to clear its records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms.

You and/or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing for a dissolution in Florida. You must file this form if the following is true:</p>\n<p>Â• You and your spouse have a dependent or minor child(ren) together or the wife is pregnant.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If your spouse is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT. If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED. If your spouse files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED. If your spouse files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1086</span> the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If your spouse files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep your address confidential because you are the victim of sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery, or domestic violence do not enter the address, telephone, and fax information at the bottom of this form. Instead, file Request for Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h).</p>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Â• Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e), if you are asking that child support be ordered in the final judgment. (If you do not know your spouse's income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1), if you and your spouse have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed with the petition if the petitioner seeks to establish child support. Otherwise, it must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1087</span> service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition, unless you and your spouse have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), Safety Focused Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(b), or Relocation/Long-Distance Parenting Plan 12.995(c). If the parents have reached an agreement, a signed and notarized Parenting Plan should be attached. If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed.</blockquote>\n<p>Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing. If you and your spouse are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a timesharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing based on the child(ren)'s best interests. Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves jurisdiction to modify issues relating to the minor child(ren).</p>\n<p>The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting issues. The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) being served. For more information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p>A parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses where you live.</p>\n<p>Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition. If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an attorney before going any further.</p>\n<p>Â• Shared Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Sole Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Supervised Time-Sharing</p>\n<p>Â• No contact</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan Recommendation</p>\n<p>Â• Time-Sharing Schedule</p>\n<p>Child Support. The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents. You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Alimony. Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1088</span> you must request it in writing in the original petition or counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities. Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. \"Equitable\" does not necessarily mean \"equal.\" Many factors, including child support, time-sharing, and alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief. If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, parental responsibility and timesharing with child(ren), temporary child support, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement. If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1). Both of you must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk. Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan. In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved or established by the court. If you and your spouse have reached an agreement, you should file a Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), Safety Focused Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(b), or Relocation/Long-Distance Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(c), which addresses the time-sharing schedule for the child(ren). If you have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed. If the parties are unable to agree, a Parenting Plan will be established by the court.</p>\n<p>Final Judgment Form. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(1), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(1). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer. Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1089</span> Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.

You and/or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing for a dissolution in Florida. If you and your spouse agree on all issues and both can attend the hearing, you may want to file a simplified dissolution of marriage petition, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.901(a). However, you cannot file for a simplified dissolution of marriage if any of the following are true:</p>\n<p>Â• You disagree about property, debts, or other matters and wish to have a judge settle them for you.</p>\n<p>Â• Either you or your spouse is seeking support (alimony).</p>\n<p>Â• You would like to ask questions and get documents concerning your spouse's income, expenses, assets, debts, or other matters before having a trial or settlement.</p>\n<p>Â• You would like to reserve your rights to have any matters reconsidered or appeal the judge's decision.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If your spouse is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT ... If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1096</span> Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep your address confidential because you are the victim of sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery or domestic violence do not enter the address, telephone, and fax information at the bottom of this form. Instead, file a Request for Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h).</p>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</p>\n<p>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2), if you and your spouse have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1097</span> Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition, unless you and your spouse have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Alimony ... Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in the original petition or counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities... Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. \"Equitable\" does not necessarily mean \"equal.\" Many factors, including alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief ... If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(c). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement ... If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Property But No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2). Both husband and wife must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk. Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Final JudgmentÂ Form ... These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(2), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(2). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer ... Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1098</span> the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n            IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE _____________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n                IN AND FOR __________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                               Case No: _________________\n                                               Division: _________________\n____________________,\n          Petitioner,\n     and\n_____________________,\n           Respondent.\n              PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE\n         WITH PROPERTY BUT NO DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n       I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ________________________________, the\n[Choose one only] ( ) Husband ( ) Wife, being sworn, certify that the following statements are true:\n1.

You and/or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing for a dissolution in Florida. If you and your spouse agree on all issues and both can attend the hearing, you may want to file a petition for simplified dissolution of marriage, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.901(a). However, you may file this form if all of the following are true:</p>\n<p>Â• You have no marital assets or marital debts.</p>\n<p>Â• Neither you nor your spouse is seeking support (alimony).</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If your spouse is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT ... If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1103</span> law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep your address confidential because you are the victim of sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery, or domestic violence do not enter the address, telephone, and fax information at the bottom of this form. Instead, file a Request for Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h).</p>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition.)</p>\n<p>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition, unless you and your spouse have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Final JudgmentÂ Form ... These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with No Property or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(3). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1104</span> judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer ... Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1105</span>\n                 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE_______________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n                    IN AND FOR _________________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                                      Case No: _________________\n                                                      Division: ________________\n_______________________________,\n                     Petitioner,\n          and\n_______________________________,\n                     Respondent.\n      PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE WITH NO DEPENDENT OR MINOR\n                           CHILD(REN) OR PROPERTY\n       I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ____________________________________, the\n[Choose only one] ( ) Husband ( ) Wife, being sworn, certify that the following statements are true:\n1.

Instead, file a Request for\n   Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h).\n   The chart below contains the guideline amounts that you should use when calculating child support.\n   This amount is based on the number of children and the combined income of the parents, and it is\n   divided between the parents in direct proportion to their income or earning capacity. From time to\n   time, some of the amounts in the child support guidelines chart will change. Be sure you have the most\n   recent version of the chart before using it.\n   Because the guidelines are based on monthly amounts, it may be necessary to convert some income and\n   expense figures from other frequencies to monthly. You should do this as follows:\n         If payment is twice per month    Payment amount  Ã—    2   =    Monthly amount\n         If payment is every two weeks    Payment amount  Ã—    26  =    Yearly amount due\n                                          Yearly amount   Ã·    12  =    Monthly amount\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1131</span>\n         If payment is weekly             Weekly amount   Ã—   52  =   Yearly amount due\n                                          Yearly amount   Ã·   12  =   Monthly amount\nIf you or the other parent request that the court award an amount that is different than the guideline\namount, you must also complete and attach a Motion to Deviate from Child Support Guidelines, Florida\nSupreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.943.\nRemember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.

The answer portion of this form is used to admit or deny the allegations contained in the petition, and the counterpetition portion of this form is used to ask for whatever you want the court to do for you.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>You have 20 days to answer after being served with the other party's petition. A copy of this form must be mailed or hand delivered to the other party. After you file an answer and counterpetition your case will then generally proceed as follows:</p>\n<p>The other party is required to answer your counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... Your dissolution is uncontested if you and your spouse agree on all issues raised in the petition and the counterpetition. If this is the case, and you and the other party have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, either party may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. If you request the hearing, you must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ... Your dissolution is contested if you and your spouse disagree on any issues raised in the petition or counterpetition. If you are unable to settle the disputed issues, either party may file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d)</p>\n<p>Â• Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). (If you do not know the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1144</span> other party's income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.)</p>\n<p>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</p>\n<p>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1), if you have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), Safety-Focused Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(b), or Relocation-Long-Distance Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(c). If the parents have reached an agreement, a signed and notarized Parenting Plan should be attached. If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed.</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time you file this answer.)</p>\n<p>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time you file this answer, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing ... If you and your spouse are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing schedule based on the child(ren)'s best interests. Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves jurisdiction to modify issues relating to the minor child(ren).</p>\n<p>The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting issues. The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) being served. For more information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p>A parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses or mediation where you live.</p>\n<p>Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition. If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an attorney before going any further.</p>\n<p>Â• Shared Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Sole Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Supervised Time-Sharing</p>\n<p>Â• No contact</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan Recommendation</p>\n<p>Â• Time-Sharing Schedule</p>\n<p>Child Support ... The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1145</span> the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents. You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Alimony ... Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in your counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities... Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. Equitable does not necessarily mean equal. Many factors, including child support, time-sharing and alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan ... In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved or established by the court. If you and your spouse have reached an agreement, you should file a Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), 12.995(b), or 12.995(c) which addresses the time-sharing schedule for the child(ren). If you have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed. A Parenting Plan will be established by the court.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief ... If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, parental responsibility and time-sharing with child(ren), temporary child support, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement ... If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1). Both parties must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk. Any issues on which you <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1146</span> are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Final JudgmentÂ Form ... These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(1), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(1). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer ... Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1147</span>\n     IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE __________________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n         IN AND FOR _________________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                            Case No: __________________\n                                            Division: _________________\n______________________________,\n                    Petitioner,\n         and\n______________________________,\n                    Respondent.\n   ANSWER TO PETITION AND COUNTERPETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE\n                   WITH DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n        I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ____________________ Respondent, being\nsworn, certify that the following information is true:\nANSWER TO PETITION\n1.

The answer portion of this form is used to admit or deny the allegations contained in the petition, and the counterpetition portion of this form is used to ask for whatever you want the court to do for you.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>You have 20 days to answer after being served with the other party's petition. A copy of this form must be mailed or hand delivered to the other party. After you file an answer and counterpetition your case will then generally proceed as follows:</p>\n<p>The other party is required to answer your counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... Your dissolution is uncontested if you and your spouse agree on all issues raised in the petition and the counterpetition. If this is the case, and you and the other party have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, either party may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. If you request the hearing, you must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ... Your dissolution is contested if you and your spouse disagree on any issues raised in the petition or counterpetition. If you are unable to settle the disputed issues, either party may file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1155</span> (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</p>\n<p>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2), if you have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c).

(This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time you file this answer, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Alimony ... Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in your counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities... Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. Equitable does not necessarily mean equal. Many factors, including alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief ... If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(c). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement ... If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2). Both parties must sign this agreement before a notary public. Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Final JudgmentÂ Forms ... These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(2), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(2). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1156</span> final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer ... Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.

You can only use this form if a dissolution of marriage has not been filed and based upon the time-sharing schedule, you are entitled to support. If a petition for dissolution of marriage has been filed, you should file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a), instead of using this petition. Also, if you are requesting that an order be entered for you to pay support to your spouse, you should not file this form.</p>\n<p>This petition cannot address the issues of property, debts, or parental responsibility and time-sharing with child(ren). It only deals with alimony and child support.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other party in your case of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if the other party resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If you need to use constructive service, use the Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), after striking through \"for Dissolution of Marriage\" and inserting \"for Support Unconnected with Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren).\" If the other party is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT. If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1163</span> using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED. If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED. If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see section 61.09, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>With this form you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d), if the case involves minor or dependent child(ren).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c).</p>\n<p>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Â• Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e), if you are asking that child support be ordered in the final judgment. (If you do not know the other party's income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.)</p>\n<p>Child Support. The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1164</span> of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each parent. You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief. If you need temporary relief regarding child support or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Final Judgment Form. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Support Unconnected with Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.994(a), which the judge may use if your case is contested. You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer. Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1165</span>\n     IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE ________________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n        IN AND FOR _______________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                          Case No: _____________\n                                          Division: ____________\n_____________________,\n           Petitioner,\n   and\n_____________________,\n           Respondent.\nPETITION FOR SUPPORT UNCONNECTED WITH DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE WITH\n                        DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n       I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ___________________________________________, the\n( ) Husband ( ) Wife, being sworn, certify that the following statements are true:\n1.

After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records. This form and these instructions do not apply to modification of temporary orders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other party in your case of the supplemental petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if the other party resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting dissolution of marriage, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If the other party is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your supplemental petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT . . . If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED . . . If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your supplemental petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1177</span> Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED . . . If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your supplemental petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the beginning of these forms.

These documents must be provided by mail or hand delivery to the other party within 45 days of service of the petition for dissolution of marriage or supplemental petition for modification on the respondent. The mandatory disclosure rule applies to all original and supplemental dissolution of marriage cases, except simplified dissolution of marriage cases and cases where the respondent is served by constructive service and does not answer. You should use this form to notify the court and the other party that you have complied with the mandatory disclosure rule.</p>\n<p>Each party must provide the other party with the documents listed in section 2 of this form if the relief being sought is permanent regardless of whether it is an initial or supplemental proceeding. Of the documents listed on this form, the financial affidavit and child support guidelines worksheet are the only documents that may be required to be filed with the court under Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 12.285(c) and (k) but must be sent to the other party; all other documents should be sent to the other party but shall not be filed with the court. If your individual gross annual income is under $50,000, you should complete the Family Law Financial Affidavit (Short Form), Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b). If your individual gross annual income is $50,000 or more, you should complete the Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(c).</p>\n<p>In addition, there are separate mandatory disclosure requirements that apply to temporary financial hearings, which are listed in section 1 of this form. The party seeking temporary financial relief must serve these documents on the other party with the notice of temporary financial hearing. The responding party must either deliver the required documents to the party seeking temporary relief on or before 5:00 p.m., 2 business days before the hearing on temporary relief, or mail (postmark) them to the other party seeking temporary relief 7 days before the hearing on temporary financial relief. Any documents that have already been served under the requirements for temporary or initial proceedings, do not need to be reserved again in the same proceeding. If a supplemental petition is filed, seeking modification, then the mandatory disclosure requirements begin again.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where your case is filed and keep a copy for your records. A copy of this form must be mailed or hand delivered to any other party in your case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>After you have provided the other party all of the financial information and documents and have filed this form certifying that you have complied with this rule, you are under a continuing duty to promptly give the other party any information or documents that change your financial status or that make the information already provided inaccurate. You should not file with the clerk any of the documents listed in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1210</span> certificate of compliance other than the financial affidavit and child support guidelines worksheet. Refer to the instructions regarding the petition in your case to determine how you should proceed after filing this form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. For further information, see rule 12.285, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>You may provide copies of required documents; however, the originals must be produced for inspection if the other party requests to see them.</p>\n<p>Although the financial affidavits are based on individual gross income, either party may ask the other party to complete the Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(c), by serving the appropriate interrogatory form. (See Standard Family Law Interrogatories, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(b) (original proceedings) or (c) (modification proceedings)).</p>\n<p>Any portion of the mandatory disclosure rule may be modified by order of the judge or agreement of the parties. Therefore, you and your spouse may agree that you will not require each other to produce the documents required under the mandatory disclosure rule. This exception does not apply to the Financial Affidavit, Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), which is required in all cases and cannot be waived.</p>\n<p>Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.

The Parenting Plan must be developed and agreed to by the parents and approved by the court. If the parties cannot agree to a Parenting Plan or if the parents agreed to a plan that is not approved by the court, a Parenting Plan will be established by the court with or without the use of parenting plan recommendations. This form or a similar form should be used in the development of a Parenting Plan. If the case involves supervised time-sharing, the Safety Focused Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(b) or a similar form should be used. If the case involves relocation, pursuant to Section 61.13001, Florida Statutes, then a Relocation/Long Distance Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(c) or a similar form should be used.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. Please either delete or strike-through terms or paragraphs that are inappropriate or in applicable to your agreement. If an agreement has been reached, both parties must sign the Parenting Plan and have their signatures witnessed by a notary public or deputy clerk. After completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records. You should then refer to the instructions for your petition, answer, or answer and counterpetition concerning the procedures for setting a hearing or trial (final hearing). If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed by either parent at the time of or any time prior to the final hearing. If an agreed Parenting Plan is not filed by the parties, the court shall establish a Plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes, and the instructions for the petition and/or answer that were filed in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>At a minimum, the Parenting Plan must describe in adequate detail:</p>\n<p>Â• How the parties will share and be responsible for the daily tasks associated with the upbringing of the child(ren),</p>\n<p>Â• The time-sharing schedule arrangements that specify the time that the minor child(ren) will spend with each parent,</p>\n<p>Â• A designation of who will be responsible for any and all forms of health care, school-related matters, including the address to be used for school-boundary determination and registration, other activities, and</p>\n<p>Â• The methods and technologies that the parents will use to communicate with the child(ren).</p>\n<p>The best interests of the child(ren) is the primary consideration in the Parenting Plan. In creating the Parenting Plan, all circumstances between the parents, including their historic relationship, domestic violence, and other factors must be taken into consideration. Determination of the best interests <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1266</span> of the child(ren) shall be made by evaluating all of the factors affecting the welfare and interest of the particular minor child(ren) and the circumstances of that family, as listed in section 61.13(3), Florida Statutes, including, but not limited to:</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship, to honor the time-sharing schedule, and to be reasonable when changes are required;</p>\n<p>Â• The anticipated division of parental responsibilities after the litigation, including the extent to which parental responsibilities will be delegated to third parties;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to determine, consider, and act upon the needs of the child(ren) as opposed to the needs or desires of the parent;</p>\n<p>Â• The length of time the child(ren) has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity;</p>\n<p>Â• The geographic viability of the parenting plan, with special attention paid to the needs of school-age children and the amount of time to be spent traveling to effectuate the parenting plan. This factor does not create a presumption for or against relocation of either parent with a child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The moral fitness of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The mental and physical health of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The home, school, and community record of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The reasonable preference of the child(ren), if the court deems the child(ren) to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated knowledge, capacity, and disposition of each parent to be informed of the circumstances of the minor child(ren), including, but not limited to, the child(ren)'s friends, teachers, medical care providers, daily activities, and favorite things;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to provide a consistent routine for the child(ren), such as discipline, and daily schedules for homework, meals, and bedtime;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity of each parent to communicate with and keep the other parent informed of issues and activities regarding the minor child(ren), and the willingness of each parent to adopt a unified front on all major issues when dealing with the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence of domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, regardless of whether a prior or pending action relating to those issues has been brought. If the court accepts evidence of prior or pending actions regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, the court must specifically acknowledge in writing that such evidence was considered when evaluating the best interests of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence that either parent has knowingly provided false information to the court regarding any prior or pending action regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect;</p>\n<p>Â• The particular parenting tasks customarily performed by each parent and the division or parental responsibilities before the institution of litigation and during the pending litigation, including the extent to which parenting responsibilities were undertaken by third parties;</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1267</span> Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to participate and be involved in the child(ren)'s school and extracurricular activities;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to maintain an environment for the child(ren) which is free from substance abuse;</p>\n<p>Â• The capacity and disposition of each parent to protect the child(ren) from the ongoing litigation as demonstrated by not discussing the litigation with the child(ren), not sharing documents or electronic media related to the litigation with the child(ren), and refraining from disparaging comments about the other parent to the child(ren); and</p>\n<p>Â• The developmental stages and needs of the child(ren) and the demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to meet the child(ren)'s developmental needs.</p>\n<p>This standard form does not include every possible issue that may be relevant to the facts of your case. The Parenting Plan should be as detailed as possible to address the time-sharing schedule. Additional provisions should be added to address all of the relevant factors.

In creating the Parenting Plan, all circumstances between the parents, including their historic relationship, domestic violence, and other factors must be taken into consideration. Determination of the best interests of the child(ren) shall be made by evaluating all of the factors affecting the welfare and interest of the particular minor child(ren) and the circumstances of that family, as listed in section 61.13(3), Florida Statutes, including, but not limited to:</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship, to honor the time-sharing schedule, and to be reasonable when changes are required;</p>\n<p>Â• The anticipated division of parental responsibilities after the litigation, including the extent to which parental responsibilities will be delegated to third parties;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to determine, consider, and act upon the needs of the child(ren) as opposed to the needs or desires of the parent;</p>\n<p>Â• The length of time the child(ren) has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity;</p>\n<p>Â• The geographic viability of the parenting plan, with special attention paid to the needs of school-age children and the amount of time to be spent traveling to effectuate the parenting plan. This factor does not create a presumption for or against relocation of either parent with a child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The moral fitness of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The mental and physical health of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The home, school, and community record of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The reasonable preference of the child(ren), if the court deems the child(ren) to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated knowledge, capacity, and disposition of each parent to be informed of the circumstances of the minor child(ren), including, but not limited to, the child(ren)'s friends, teachers, medical care providers, daily activities, and favorite things;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to provide a consistent routine for the child(ren), such as discipline, and daily schedules for homework, meals, and bedtime;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity of each parent to communicate with and keep the other parent informed of issues and activities regarding the minor child(ren), and the willingness of each parent to adopt a unified front on all major issues when dealing with the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence of domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, regardless of whether a prior or pending action relating to those issues has been brought. If the court accepts evidence of prior or pending actions regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, the court must specifically acknowledge, in writing that such evidence was considered when evaluating the bests interests of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence that either parent has knowingly provided false information to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1283</span> court regarding any prior or pending action regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect;</p>\n<p>Â• The particular parenting tasks customarily performed by each parent and the division of parental responsibilities before the institution of litigation and during the pending litigation, including the extent to which parenting responsibilities were undertaken by third parties;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to participate and be involved in the child(ren)'s school and extracurricular activities;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to maintain an environment for the child(ren) which is free from substance abuse;</p>\n<p>Â• The capacity and disposition of each parent to protect the child(ren) from the ongoing litigation as demonstrated by not discussing the litigation with the child(ren), not sharing documents or electronic media related to the litigation with the child(ren), and refraining from disparaging comments about the other parent to the child)ren); and</p>\n<p>Â• The developmental stages and needs of the child(ren) and the demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to meet the child(ren)'s developmental needs.</p>\n<p>This standard form does not include every possible issue that may be relevant to the facts of your case. The Parenting Plan should be as detailed as possible to address the time-sharing schedule. Additional provisions should be added to address all of the relevant factors.

Rule of Jud. Admin. 2.420 &amp; Fla. Rules of App. Pro.,</i> 31 So.3d 756 (amending Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 to provide comprehensive procedures for identifying and segregating confidential information in court records, for sealing and unsealing court records, and for reviewing orders issued under the rule.)</p>\n<p>[19]  The phrase \"or authorized by statute, another rule, or court order\" is meant to clarify that conflicting provisions of another rule of court, a statute, or a court order will control over the rule 2.425 requirements.</p>\n<p>[20]  In proposing this prohibition, the Rules of Judicial Administration Committee recognized that the standard business and banking practice is to use the last four digits of such numbers, but the committee determined it would be best to completely preclude the filing of such numbers because of their confidential status under rule 2.420(d)(1)(B)(iii). We agree that these highly sensitive and otherwise confidential personal identifying numbers should not be filed, unless exempt from the rule 2.425(a) limitations as provided in the rule.</p>\n<p>[21]  The composite comments of the Florida criminal justice organizations filed in this case include comments or resolutions in support of the exemption from the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Miami-Dade County Association of Chiefs of Police, the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, the Florida Public Defender Association, Inc., and the Florida Bar Criminal Law Section.</p>\n<p>[22]  The Criminal Procedure Rules Committee should oversee this project, and the committees' joint report should be filed with the Court by December 1, 2011.</p>\n<p>[23]  The Small Claims Rules Committee declined to offer conforming amendments to the Small Claims Rules. Rather, that committee asks the Court to postpone amending the Small Claims Rules until the committee has an opportunity to consider the version of rule 2.425 the Court adopts. Therefore, we defer adoption of pending amendments to the Small Claim Rules that are impacted by the adoption of rule 2.425 and have directed the Small Claims Rules Committee to use its fast-track procedures to file a report with conforming rule amendments by September 1, 2011. However, we adopt other pending amendments to the Small Claims Rules that will limit the filing of unnecessary personal information but are not directly affected by the adoption of new rule 2.425. They are new rule 7.140(e)(3), which requires the judge to assist an unrepresented party in the handling of private information, and forms 7.340 (Final Judgment) and 7.373 (Fact Information Sheet), which are amended to instruct that the Fact Information Sheet should not be filed with the Court.\n</p>\n<p>We ask that in the future, when the Court seeks proposed rule amendments to address a given topic from a number of rules committees, each committee comply with the Court's request and individual committees not decline to act until proposals from other committees are acted upon. <i>See, e.g., In re Amends. to Fla. Rules of Jud. Admin., Fla. Rules of Civil Pro., Fla. Rules of Crim. Pro., Fla. Rules of Civil Pro. for Involuntary Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators, Fla. Probate Rules, Fla.

Rule of Jud. Admin. 2.420 &amp; Fla. Rules of App. Pro.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1581877\"><a href=\"/opinion/1581877/in-re-amend-to-rule-of-jud-admin-2420/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span>, 757 (Fla.2010) (recognizing that refinement of rule governing confidential court records was a necessary step in providing the public electronic access to court records).</p>\n<p>The amendments at issue here further implement recommendations of the Committee on Privacy and Court Records (Privacy Committee) and are the result of the combined efforts of the Committee on Access to Court Records (Access Committee), its successor, the Florida Court Technology Commission's Subcommittee on Access to Court Records (Access Subcommittee),<sup>[3]</sup> and the Florida Bar Rules Committees. After considering the various proposals and comments filed in this case, and hearing oral argument, we amend the rules and forms to minimize the personal information filed with the court. Most notably, we adopt new Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425 (Minimization of the Filing of Sensitive Information) to govern the filing of sensitive personal information, which is the linchpin of the minimization efforts. We take this opportunity to emphasize that in order to avoid the electronic dissemination of sensitive personal information unnecessary to court proceedings, both attorneys and pro se litigants must be vigilant to file only authorized documents that comply with the requirements adopted here.</p>\n<p>The newly enacted rules provide for sanctions for violations of these rules. However, continual education and a change in mindset for all those involved in the litigation process are necessary for these rules to work as intended. After all, with the benefits of electronic access to documents comes the responsibility to minimize unnecessary personal information in court records. With those beginning cautions, we explain the evolution of the amendments and the substance of the major amendments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The Privacy Committee was created in November 2003 and charged with providing recommendations to the Court regarding electronic access to court records. <i>See In re Comm. on Privacy and Court Records,</i> Fla. Admin. Order No. AOSC04-04 (Feb. 12, 2004) (substituted for AOSC03-49). As relevant to the amendments at issue here, the Privacy Committee was charged with recommending strategies for reducing the amount of unnecessary personal information in court records. <i>Id.</i> at 5. After the Privacy Committee submitted its report and recommendations<sup>[4]</sup> and the Court held public hearings on the recommendations, an administrative order was issued partially implementing the Privacy Committee's recommendations.<sup>[5]</sup> That administrative order noted the Court's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> agreement with the Privacy Committee that the Florida judicial branch should have a goal of providing electronic access to nonconfidential court records when appropriate conditions are met, one of which is minimizing the amount of unnecessary personal information in court records.<sup>[6]</sup> By separate administrative order, the Access Committee was created to assist the Court in implementing a number of the Privacy Committee recommendations,<sup>[7]</sup> including the \"minimization\" recommendations addressed here.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>As relevant here, the Privacy Committee reported as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Florida court files commonly contain information which is not required by law or rule and which is not needed by the court for purposes of adjudication or case management. Once entered into a court file this information becomes a matter of public record. Much of this information is personal or sensitive in nature. The Committee perceives that there is not a clear understanding on the part of attorneys and the general public of the negative effects on personal privacy of placing unnecessary information in a court record.</blockquote>\n<p>Privacy Committee Report at 56. The inclusion of unnecessary personal information in court filings is of special concern because providing electronic access, which would include internet access, to court records will make nonconfidential personal information contained in those records more readily accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this concern, the Privacy Committee made four recommendations intended to minimize the filing of extraneous personal information. Privacy Committee Recommendation Seven urges the review and revision of court rules and forms to avoid the filing of personal information that is not necessary for adjudication or case management.<sup>[9]</sup> Recommendation Eight recommends the study of a court rule to prohibit the filing of unauthorized documents.<sup>[10]</sup> Recommendation Nine suggests clarifying Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.285 (Mandatory Disclosure) to avoid the unnecessary filing of financial information in family law cases.<sup>[11]</sup> And Recommendation Ten urges the adoption of a rule that prohibits the filing of discovery information with the court unless the information is filed for good cause and that provides for sanctions if the rule is violated.<sup>[12]</sup> These \"minimization\" recommendations were referred to the Florida Bar rules committees to propose rule and form amendments implementing the recommendations.<sup>[13]</sup> The rules committees' proposals <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> were then referred to the Access Committee for consideration<sup>[14]</sup> and preparation of an omnibus petition of proposed rule amendments. The Access Committee's petition of proposed amendments, as well as revised and new proposals offered by the rules committees are before the Court here.</p>\n<p>In considering the proposals, the Court had the benefit of comments from interested persons, as well as responses and input from the Access Subcommittee (successor to the Access Committee)<sup>[15]</sup> and the various rules committees on a number of issues of concern to the Court. <i>See In re Implementation of Comm. on Privacy &amp; Court Records Recommendations,</i> No. SC08-2443 (Fla. order filed April 1, 2010) (seeking input on a number of issues); <i>see also In re Implementation of Comm. on Privacy &amp; Court Records Recommendations,</i> No. SC08-2443 (Fla. order filed May 19, 2010) (seeking input on suggested new rule 2.425). In response to the Court's concern about consistency among the various rules proposed to govern the filing of sensitive personal information, the committees now urge the adoption of new Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425 (Minimization of the Filing of Sensitive Information) and conforming amendments to the other bodies of rules and forms.</p>\n<p>After considering the various proposals, we amend the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Florida Probate Rules, the Florida Small Claims Rules, the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure and forms, as reflected in the appendix to this opinion. We discuss the more significant amendments below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>AMENDMENTS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>New Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425 and Other Amendments Limiting the Filing of Extraneous Personal Information</h2>\n<p>New rule 2.425 (Minimization of the Filing of Sensitive Information) is the centerpiece of the amendments adopted in this case. The new rule governs the filing of sensitive personal information in all types of cases, except traffic and criminal proceedings.<sup>[16]</sup> It implements Privacy Committee Recommendation Seven, which urges revision of court rules and forms to avoid the filing of personal information that is not necessary for adjudication or case management.<sup>[17]</sup> The new rule of judicial administration sets forth the categories of personal information that must not be filed or must be truncated or redacted before filing, and provides exceptions that allow for the filing of complete information in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p>The new rule serves as a companion to recently amended Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 (Public Access to Judicial Branch Records).<sup>[18]</sup> New rule 2.425 provides <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> the procedures for protecting personal information being filed with the court; while rule 2.420 governs the procedures for determining the confidentiality of information after it has been filed and for providing public access to nonconfidential information. Rule 2.425 is loosely modeled after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 (Privacy Protection for Filings Made with the Court). The most important provisions of the new rule are discussed below.</p>\n<p>First, under subdivision (a) (Limitations for Court Filings) of the new rule, unless exempted by subdivision (b) (Exceptions), or authorized by statute, another rule, or court order,<sup>[19]</sup> personal information of the type listed either must not be filed or must be truncated or redacted before filing. Under subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) only the initials of a minor and the year of birth of a person's birth date may be included in filings, and under subdivision (a)(3), no portion of a social security number, bank account number, credit card account number, charge account number, or debit account number can be filed,<sup>[20]</sup> unless the number falls within one of the subdivision (b) exceptions, or is authorized by statute, another rule, or court order.</p>\n<p>Only the last four digits of certain other personal identifying numbers (i.e., driver's license number, passport number, taxpayer identification number, and patient or health care number) are allowed under subdivision (a)(4). Similarly, a truncated version of other types of personal information (i.e., email address, password, and other sensitive information as provided by court order) is allowed under subdivisions (a)(5) and (a)(6).</p>\n<p>Next, subdivision (b) (Exceptions) allows for the filing of complete information under certain circumstances. For example, under subdivisions (b)(1), (b)(5), and (b)(6) respectively, an account number that identifies the property alleged to be the subject of a proceeding, the birth date of a minor whenever the birth date is necessary for the court to establish or maintain subject matter jurisdiction, and the name of a minor in any document or order affecting the minor's ownership of real property are exempt from the subdivision (a) limitations. Under subdivision (b)(10), information that is relevant and material to an issue before the court also is exempt.</p>\n<p>Subdivision (b)(8), which we adopt on an interim basis, exempts from the requirements of the rule filings in traffic and criminal proceedings. This exception is strongly supported by the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee, prosecutors, and defense attorneys, as well as numerous Florida criminal justice organizations.<sup>[21]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1051</span> The Rules Committee and criminal justice organizations maintain that much of the information filed in criminal cases that would have to be truncated or redacted under the new rule must be available to defense attorneys, law enforcement, and others in the criminal justice system. The proponents of the exception also caution that application of the rule would result in substantial workload issues for prosecutors' offices that would be required to truncate or redact massive amounts of information routinely contained in arrest affidavits, search warrants, charging documents, traffic citations, police reports, and discovery documents filed with the court. We acknowledge the reasons advanced for treating filings in criminal and traffic proceedings differently than filings in other cases. However, filings in criminal and traffic cases contain a large portion of the personal information filed with our courts and a \"blanket\" exception for those filings would not be necessary if a finely tailored rule can be drafted to govern them. Therefore, we direct the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee, the Traffic Court Rules Committee, and the Rules of Judicial Administration Committee to work together to propose a rule or rules similar to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 49.1 (Privacy Protection for Filings Made with the Court) to govern the filing of sensitive personal information in criminal and traffic proceedings.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, subdivision (c) (Remedies) provides remedies and sanctions for violations of the rule. And subdivisions (d) (Motions Not Restricted) and (e) (Application) clarify the new rule's interplay with rule 2.420 (Public Access to Judicial Branch Records) and explain that the new rule does not affect the application of constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of court governing confidential information or access to public records.</p>\n<p>Other rules of procedure and forms are amended to conform to or reference new rule 2.425.<sup>[23]</sup> For example, new Rule of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1052</span> Appellate Procedure 9.050 (Maintaining Privacy of Personal Data) requires all briefs, petitions, replies, appendices, motions, notices, stipulations, and responses filed with the court comply with rule 2.425. Family Law Rules 12.130(c) (Protection of Account and Personal Identifying Numbers), 12.440(a) (Setting for Trial), 12.540 (Relief from Judgment, Decrees, or Orders), and 12.620 (Receivers) are amended to require compliance with rule 2.425. Amendments to the civil and family law discovery rules also incorporate the requirements of rule 2.425. <i>See</i> Appendix, <i>infra,</i> pp. 1055-57, 1074-78 (amending Fla. R. Civil P. 1.280; 1.310; 1.340; 1.350; Fla. Fam. L.R.P. 12.280; 12.285; 12.340; 12.370; 12.410; 12.560).</p>\n<p>To further implement Privacy Committee Recommendation Seven (Revision of Rules and Forms Leading to Extraneous Personal Information), the various civil judgment forms are amended to require that only the last four digits of the judgment debtor's social security number be included in the judgment. Probate Rules 5.200 (Petition for Administration), 5.210 (Probate of Wills without Administration), and 5.530 (Summary Administration) are likewise amended to require that only the last four digits of the decedent's social security number be included in petitions filed under those rules.<sup>[24]</sup> Similarly, to limit the filing of personal information in criminal cases, Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.140(c)(4) (Personal Statistics) is amended to delete the requirement that the defendant's social security number be included in the charging document.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(f) and Other Amendments Limiting the Filing of Discovery and Financial Information</h2>\n<p>New Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(f) (Court Filing of Documents and Discovery) works in conjunction with new rule 2.425, by requiring that all discovery documents filed with the court comply with the requirements for the filing of personal information. However, the new discovery rule's primary purpose is to implement Privacy Committee Recommendation Ten,<sup>[26]</sup> by prohibiting the filing of information obtained during discovery unless the information is filed for good cause and giving the court authority to impose sanctions for violation of the rule. The Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1053</span> revised the language of proposed rule 1.280(f) to clarify that good cause is satisfied only where the filing of the information is allowed or required by another applicable rule of procedure or by court order. This requirement is intended to stop abuses of personal information obtained during discovery by preventing the filing of discovery information unless it is necessary to the proceedings. Other civil discovery rules are amended to require compliance with new rule 1.280(f). <i>See</i> Appendix, <i>infra,</i> pp. 1055-57 (amending Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.310; 1.340; 1.350).</p>\n<p>Family law discovery rules also are amended to limit the filing of discovery information. New subdivision (c) is added to Family Law Rule 12.340 (Interrogatories to Parties) to require that responses to interrogatories be served but not filed with the court, unless they are admitted into evidence and are in compliance with rule 2.425. Rule 12.370 (Requests for Admissions) is amended to require that documents attached to a request for admissions be served with the request but not filed with the court. The amendments to rule 12.560 (Discovery in Aid of Execution) prohibits the filing of a fact information sheet, civil form 1.977, unless ordered by the court for good cause shown.</p>\n<p>Similarly, subdivisions (b) and (e) of rule 12.363 (Evaluations of Minor Child) are amended to prevent the filing of an evaluation of a minor child unless the report is being admitted into evidence. If the report is filed, the filing must comply with rule 2.425. The Media Organizations<sup>[27]</sup> that commented on these amendments urge us to reject the requirement, added to subdivision (e), that the court consider whether the report should be sealed under rule 2.420. The Media Organizations maintain that rule 2.420 places the burden of seeking a determination of confidentiality of court records on the proponent of closure, not the court. In response, the Family Law Rules Committee points out that the court has inherent authority to protect the interests of children whose parents are before the court, citing <i>Simms v. State Department of Health &amp; Rehabilitative Services,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1584253\"><a href=\"/opinion/1584253/simms-v-state-dept-of-health-rehab/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span>, 961 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994). The Access Subcommittee explains that the recent amendments to rule 2.420 were not intended to affect the power of a court to determine, sua sponte, that a particular court record is confidential. Therefore, we defer to the committee and adopt the subdivision (e) requirement.</p>\n<p>Next, to implement Privacy Committee Recommendation Nine, which requested that the mandatory disclosure rule be clarified to avoid the unnecessary filing of financial information in family law cases,<sup>[28]</sup> as well as Recommendations Seven and Ten, we adopt new Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.285(a)(3) (Mandatory Disclosure; Documents Not to be Filed with Court; Sanctions), and amend rule 12.287 (Financial Affidavits in Enforcement and Contempt Proceedings). New rule 12.285(a)(3)(A) highlights language currently in the rule stating that except for financial affidavits and child support guidelines worksheets, documents produced under the rule are not to be filed with the court absent a court order. Subdivision (a)(3)(B) requires that account numbers and personal identifying information are governed by rule 2.425. And subdivision (a)(3)(C) provides that sanctions are governed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1054</span> by new rule 1.280(f). New rule 12.285(c) (Exemption for Requirement to File and Serve Financial Affidavit) prohibits the filing and service of a financial affidavit if the parties are seeking a simplified dissolution of marriage under 12.105 and certain conditions are met. The current rule 12.105(c) requirement that the parties to a simplified dissolution proceeding file a financial affidavit and marital settlement agreement is deleted, and the family law forms are amended accordingly. Rule 12.287 is amended to delete the requirement that a requested financial affidavit be filed with the court in enforcement and contempt proceedings and to add a requirement that a notice of compliance with the service requirement be filed instead.<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p>The family law rules of procedure forms are amended to conform with the amendments to the family law rules. Additionally, the instructions to several of the rules forms and approved forms are amended to conform to section 119.071(2)(j)(1), Florida Statutes (2010), which was enacted to protect the confidentiality of victims of domestic violence, sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, and aggravated battery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Amendments to Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms</h2>\n<p>Finally, with input from the Court's Advisory Workgroup on the Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms,<sup>[30]</sup> we amend the Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms to ensure that the forms do not prompt those who use them to provide unnecessary personal information, such as \"place of marriage,\" \"date of separation,\" \"place of birth of minor children,\" or \"gender of minor children.\" The requirement to include a statement of the \"best interest of the child(ren)\" is deleted from form 12.905(d) (Supplemental Petition for Temporary Modification of Parenting Issues for Child(ren) of Parent Activated, Deployed, or Temporarily Assigned to Military Service), as unnecessary. Requests for financial information that is required to be provided in the family financial affidavits also is removed from form 12.943 (Motion to Deviate from Child Support Guidelines). Other more minor changes also are made to the approved forms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We thank the Access Committee, the Access Subcommittee, the Florida Bar Rules Committees, the Court's Advisory Workgroup on the Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms, and those who submitted comments for assisting the Court in moving closer to our goal of providing the public with electronic access to court records.

You must file this form if the following is true:</p>\n<p>Â• You and your spouse have a dependent or minor child(ren) together or the wife is pregnant.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If your spouse is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT. If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED. If your spouse files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED. If your spouse files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1086</span> the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If your spouse files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep your address confidential because you are the victim of sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery, or domestic violence do not enter the address, telephone, and fax information at the bottom of this form. Instead, file Request for Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h).</p>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Â• Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e), if you are asking that child support be ordered in the final judgment. (If you do not know your spouse's income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1), if you and your spouse have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed with the petition if the petitioner seeks to establish child support. Otherwise, it must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1087</span> service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition, unless you and your spouse have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Â• Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), Safety Focused Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(b), or Relocation/Long-Distance Parenting Plan 12.995(c). If the parents have reached an agreement, a signed and notarized Parenting Plan should be attached. If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed.</blockquote>\n<p>Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing. If you and your spouse are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a timesharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing based on the child(ren)'s best interests. Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves jurisdiction to modify issues relating to the minor child(ren).</p>\n<p>The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting issues. The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) being served. For more information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p>A parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses where you live.</p>\n<p>Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition. If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an attorney before going any further.</p>\n<p>Â• Shared Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Sole Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Supervised Time-Sharing</p>\n<p>Â• No contact</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan Recommendation</p>\n<p>Â• Time-Sharing Schedule</p>\n<p>Child Support. The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents. You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Alimony. Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1088</span> you must request it in writing in the original petition or counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities. Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. \"Equitable\" does not necessarily mean \"equal.\" Many factors, including child support, time-sharing, and alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief. If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, parental responsibility and timesharing with child(ren), temporary child support, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement. If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1). Both of you must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk. Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan. In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved or established by the court. If you and your spouse have reached an agreement, you should file a Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), Safety Focused Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(b), or Relocation/Long-Distance Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(c), which addresses the time-sharing schedule for the child(ren). If you have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed. If the parties are unable to agree, a Parenting Plan will be established by the court.</p>\n<p>Final Judgment Form. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(1), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(1). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer. Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1089</span> Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n          IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE ____________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n                   IN AND FOR____________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                           Case No: ____________\n                                           Division: ___________\n   ________________________,\n               Petitioner,\n          and\n   _________________________,\n               Respondent.\n            PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE\n            WITH DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n      I, <i>{full legal name}</i> __________________________________________, the\n[Choose only one] ( ) Husband ( ) Wife, being sworn, certify that the following statements are true:\n1.

You and/or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing for a dissolution in Florida. If you and your spouse agree on all issues and both can attend the hearing, you may want to file a simplified dissolution of marriage petition, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.901(a). However, you cannot file for a simplified dissolution of marriage if any of the following are true:</p>\n<p>Â• You disagree about property, debts, or other matters and wish to have a judge settle them for you.</p>\n<p>Â• Either you or your spouse is seeking support (alimony).</p>\n<p>Â• You would like to ask questions and get documents concerning your spouse's income, expenses, assets, debts, or other matters before having a trial or settlement.</p>\n<p>Â• You would like to reserve your rights to have any matters reconsidered or appeal the judge's decision.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If your spouse is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT ... If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1096</span> Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep your address confidential because you are the victim of sexual battery, aggravated child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery or domestic violence do not enter the address, telephone, and fax information at the bottom of this form. Instead, file a Request for Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h).</p>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</p>\n<p>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2), if you and your spouse have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1097</span> Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition, unless you and your spouse have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Alimony ... Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in the original petition or counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities... Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. \"Equitable\" does not necessarily mean \"equal.\" Many factors, including alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief ... If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(c). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement ... If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Property But No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2). Both husband and wife must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk. Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Final JudgmentÂ Form ... These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(2), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(2). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer ... Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1098</span> the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n            IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE _____________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n                IN AND FOR __________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                               Case No: _________________\n                                               Division: _________________\n____________________,\n          Petitioner,\n     and\n_____________________,\n           Respondent.\n              PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE\n         WITH PROPERTY BUT NO DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n       I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ________________________________, the\n[Choose one only] ( ) Husband ( ) Wife, being sworn, certify that the following statements are true:\n1.

If you know the\n   income of the other party, this worksheet should accompany your financial affidavit. If you do not\n   know the other party's income, this form must be completed after the other party files his or her\n   financial affidavit, and serves a copy on you.\n   This form should be typed or printed in black ink. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit\n   court in the county where your case is filed and keep a copy for your records.\n                      What should I do next?\n   A copy of this form must be mailed or hand delivered to the other party in your case, if it is not served\n   on him or her with your initial papers.\n                      Where can I look for more information?\n   Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the\n   beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined\n   there. For further information, see section 61.30, Florida Statutes.\n                               Special notes...\n   If you want to keep your address confidential because you are the victim of sexual battery, aggravated\n   child abuse, aggravated stalking, harassment, aggravated battery, or domestic violence,, do not enter\n   the address, telephone, and fax information at the bottom of this form. Instead, file a Request for\n   Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h).\n   The chart below contains the guideline amounts that you should use when calculating child support.\n   This amount is based on the number of children and the combined income of the parents, and it is\n   divided between the parents in direct proportion to their income or earning capacity. From time to\n   time, some of the amounts in the child support guidelines chart will change. Be sure you have the most\n   recent version of the chart before using it.\n   Because the guidelines are based on monthly amounts, it may be necessary to convert some income and\n   expense figures from other frequencies to monthly. You should do this as follows:\n         If payment is twice per month    Payment amount  Ã—    2   =    Monthly amount\n         If payment is every two weeks    Payment amount  Ã—    26  =    Yearly amount due\n                                          Yearly amount   Ã·    12  =    Monthly amount\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1131</span>\n         If payment is weekly             Weekly amount   Ã—   52  =   Yearly amount due\n                                          Yearly amount   Ã·   12  =   Monthly amount\nIf you or the other parent request that the court award an amount that is different than the guideline\namount, you must also complete and attach a Motion to Deviate from Child Support Guidelines, Florida\nSupreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.943.\nRemember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out\nthese forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules\nof Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms\nalso must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every\nform he or she helps you

The answer portion of this form is used to admit or deny the allegations contained in the petition, and the counterpetition portion of this form is used to ask for whatever you want the court to do for you.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>You have 20 days to answer after being served with the other party's petition. A copy of this form must be mailed or hand delivered to the other party. After you file an answer and counterpetition your case will then generally proceed as follows:</p>\n<p>The other party is required to answer your counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... Your dissolution is uncontested if you and your spouse agree on all issues raised in the petition and the counterpetition. If this is the case, and you and the other party have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, either party may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. If you request the hearing, you must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ...

If you are unable to settle the disputed issues, either party may file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d)</p>\n<p>Â• Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). (If you do not know the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1144</span> other party's income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.)</p>\n<p>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</p>\n<p>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1), if you have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), Safety-Focused Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(b), or Relocation-Long-Distance Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(c). If the parents have reached an agreement, a signed and notarized Parenting Plan should be attached. If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed.</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time you file this answer.)</p>\n<p>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time you file this answer, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing ... If you and your spouse are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing schedule based on the child(ren)'s best interests. Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves jurisdiction to modify issues relating to the minor child(ren).</p>\n<p>The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting issues. The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) being served. For more information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p>A parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses or mediation where you live.</p>\n<p>Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition. If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an attorney before going any further.</p>\n<p>Â• Shared Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Sole Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Supervised Time-Sharing</p>\n<p>Â• No contact</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan Recommendation</p>\n<p>Â• Time-Sharing Schedule</p>\n<p>Child Support ... The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1145</span> the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents. You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Alimony ... Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in your counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities... Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. Equitable does not necessarily mean equal. Many factors, including child support, time-sharing and alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan ... In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved or established by the court. If you and your spouse have reached an agreement, you should file a Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), 12.995(b), or 12.995(c) which addresses the time-sharing schedule for the child(ren). If you have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed. A Parenting Plan will be established by the court.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief ... If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, parental responsibility and time-sharing with child(ren), temporary child support, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement ... If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1). Both parties must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk. Any issues on which you <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1146</span> are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Final JudgmentÂ Form ... These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(1), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(1). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer ... Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1147</span>\n     IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE __________________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n         IN AND FOR _________________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                            Case No: __________________\n                                            Division: _________________\n______________________________,\n                    Petitioner,\n         and\n______________________________,\n                    Respondent.\n   ANSWER TO PETITION AND COUNTERPETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE\n                   WITH DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n        I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ____________________ Respondent, being\nsworn, certify that the following information is true:\nANSWER TO PETITION\n1.

You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>You have 20 days to answer after being served with the other party's petition. A copy of this form must be mailed or hand delivered to the other party. After you file an answer and counterpetition your case will then generally proceed as follows:</p>\n<p>The other party is required to answer your counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... Your dissolution is uncontested if you and your spouse agree on all issues raised in the petition and the counterpetition. If this is the case, and you and the other party have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, either party may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. If you request the hearing, you must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ... Your dissolution is contested if you and your spouse disagree on any issues raised in the petition or counterpetition. If you are unable to settle the disputed issues, either party may file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>With this form, you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i) OR photocopy of current Florida driver's license, Florida identification card, or voter's registration card <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1155</span> (issue date of copied document must be at least six months before date case is actually filed with the clerk of the circuit court).</p>\n<p>Â• Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2), if you have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time you file this answer.)</p>\n<p>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time you file this answer, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Alimony ... Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in your counterpetition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities... Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets and marital liabilities. Equitable does not necessarily mean equal. Many factors, including alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities. Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties. If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief ... If you need temporary relief regarding temporary use of assets, temporary responsibility for liabilities, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(c). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Marital Settlement Agreement ... If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2). Both parties must sign this agreement before a notary public. Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing.</p>\n<p>Final JudgmentÂ Forms ... These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(2), which the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, the judge may use a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(2). You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1156</span> final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer ... Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1157</span>\n    IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE ________________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n       IN AND FOR ______________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                      Case No: ________________________\n                                      Division: _______________________\n_______________________,\n             Petitioner,\n      and\n_______________________,\n             Respondent.\nANSWER TO PETITION AND COUNTERPETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE\n            WITH PROPERTY BUT NO DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n      I, <i>{full legal name}</i> _________________________________________,\nRespondent, being sworn, certify that the following information is true:\n                      ANSWER TO PETITION\n1.

You can only use this form if a dissolution of marriage has not been filed and based upon the time-sharing schedule, you are entitled to support. If a petition for dissolution of marriage has been filed, you should file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a), instead of using this petition. Also, if you are requesting that an order be entered for you to pay support to your spouse, you should not file this form.</p>\n<p>This petition cannot address the issues of property, debts, or parental responsibility and time-sharing with child(ren). It only deals with alimony and child support.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other party in your case of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if the other party resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If you need to use constructive service, use the Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), after striking through \"for Dissolution of Marriage\" and inserting \"for Support Unconnected with Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren).\" If the other party is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT. If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1163</span> using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED. If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED. If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see section 61.09, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>With this form you must also file the following:</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d), if the case involves minor or dependent child(ren).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c).</p>\n<p>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the petition, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Â• Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e), if you are asking that child support be ordered in the final judgment. (If you do not know the other party's income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.)</p>\n<p>Child Support. The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1164</span> of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each parent. You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief. If you need temporary relief regarding child support or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a). For more information, see the instructions for that form.</p>\n<p>Final Judgment Form. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Support Unconnected with Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.994(a), which the judge may use if your case is contested. You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Nonlawyer. Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1165</span>\n     IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE ________________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n        IN AND FOR _______________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                          Case No: _____________\n                                          Division: ____________\n_____________________,\n           Petitioner,\n   and\n_____________________,\n           Respondent.\nPETITION FOR SUPPORT UNCONNECTED WITH DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE WITH\n                        DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)\n       I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ___________________________________________, the\n( ) Husband ( ) Wife, being sworn, certify that the following statements are true:\n1.

If a petition for dissolution has been filed, you should file a Motion for Temporary Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(c), instead of using this petition. Also, if you are requesting that an order be entered for you to pay support to your spouse, you should not file this form.</p>\n<p>This petition does not address the issues of property or debts. It only deals with alimony.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other party in your case of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if the other party resides in another state or country. However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a)(1), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). If you need to use constructive service, use the Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), after striking through \"for Dissolution of Marriage\" and inserting \"for Support Unconnected with Dissolution for Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren).\" If the other party is in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required. See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT ... If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. UNCONTESTED... If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied ------- with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1171</span> with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.

If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms.

Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that he or she needs it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay it. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in the original petition. If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later). You may request either permanent alimony, lump sum alimony, or rehabilitative alimony.</p>\n<p>Temporary Relief . . .

This means that you are trying to legally establish who is the father of the child(ren).</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What should I do next?</h2>\n<p>For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the respondent of the petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service. However, if constructive service is used, the court may only grant limited relief. You should seek legal advice on constructive service in a paternity case. For more information see chapter 49, Florida Statutes, or you may contact Child Support Enforcement at the Florida Department of Revenue if you need assistance with your case.</p>\n<p>If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways:</p>\n<p>DEFAULT ... If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>UNCONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.</p>\n<p>CONTESTED ... If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure, completed the scientific paternity testing, if necessary, and filed all of the required papers. Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1249</span> Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 742, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred.</p>\n<p>More than one child of the same alleged father may be listed on a single petition. However, if you are filing a paternity action involving more than one possible father, a separate petition must be filed for each alleged father.</p>\n<p>If the respondent files an answer denying that the person named in the petition is the child(ren)'s father, one of you should file a Motion for Scientific Paternity Testing, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(e). This is used to ask the court to order a scientific test to determine who is the child(ren)'s father.</p>\n<p>If the father signed papers at the hospital acknowledging that he was the father, paternity was established as a matter of law. This should be indicated on page 2, section 9a on this form.</p>\n<p>If the paternity of a child who was conceived or born during a marriage is at issue, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to assist the court in this matter and to protect the rights of child.</p>\n<p>With this petition, you must file the following and provide a copy to the other party:</p>\n<p>Â• Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d).</p>\n<p>Â• Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j).</p>\n<p>Â• Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c).</p>\n<p>Â• Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days, if not filed with the petition, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.)</p>\n<p>Â• Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). (If you do not know the other party's income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial affidavit has been filed.)</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form, 12.995(a), 12.995(b), or 12.995(c). If the parents have reached an agreement, a signed and notarized Parenting Plan should be attached. If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed.</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing. If the parties are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing based on the child(ren)'s best interests. Regardless of whether there is an agreement between the parties, the court reserves jurisdiction to modify issues relating to minor or dependent child(ren).</p>\n<p>The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1250</span> ad litem in your case. This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting issues. The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) are being served. For more information, you may consult sections 61.401-61.405, Florida Statutes.</p>\n<p>Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition. If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an attorney before going any further.</p>\n<p>Â• Shared Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Sole Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Supervised Time-Sharing</p>\n<p>Â• No contact</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan Recommendation</p>\n<p>Â• Time-Sharing Schedule</p>\n<p>Many circuits require that parents of a minor or dependent child(ren) who are involved in dissolution or paternity actions attend mediation before being allowed to schedule a final hearing. A parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment. You should check with your local clerk of court's office, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for more information on the parenting course and mediation requirements in your area.</p>\n<p>Child Support. The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent.</p>\n<p>Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents. You should file a financial affidavit, and the other parent will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid. Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Final Judgments. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Paternity, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(g), which the judge may use. You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring it with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1251</span>\n             IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE _____________________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n                   IN AND FOR ______________________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                                    Case No: ________________________\n                                                    Division: _______________________\n_________________________________,\n                       Petitioner,\n               and\n_________________________________,\n                       Respondent.\n            PETITION TO DETERMINE PATERNITY AND FOR RELATED RELIEF\n     Petitioner, <i>{full legal name}</i> ____________________________, being sworn, certifies that the\nfollowing information is true:\n     This is an action for paternity and to determine parental responsibility, time-sharing, and child\nsupport under chapter 742, Florida Statutes.\nSECTION I.\n1.

If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an attorney before going any further.</p>\n<p>Â• Shared Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Sole Parental Responsibility</p>\n<p>Â• Supervised Time-Sharing</p>\n<p>Â• No contact</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan</p>\n<p>Â• Parenting Plan Recommendations</p>\n<p>Â• Time-Sharing Schedule</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1258</span> Child Support. The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in meeting the child(ren)'s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent.</p>\n<p>Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents. You should file a financial affidavit, and the other parent will be required to do the same. From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid. Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations.</p>\n<p>Parenting Plan. In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved or established by the court. If the parties have reached an agreement, you should file a Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), 12.995(b), or 12.995(c), which addresses the time-sharing schedule for the child(ren). If you have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed. A Parenting Plan will be established by the court.</p>\n<p>Final Judgments. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Paternity, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(g), which the judge may use. You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring it with you to the hearing. If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties' names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.</p>\n<p>Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1259</span>\n              IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE _____________________ JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,\n                  IN AND FOR ______________________________ COUNTY, FLORIDA\n                                                      Case No: _____________________\n                                                      Division: ____________________\n_________________________________,\n                       Petitioner,\n            and\n_________________________________,\n                       Respondent.\n  ANSWER TO PETITION AND COUNTERPETITION TO DETERMINE PATERNITY AND\n                     FOR RELATED RELIEF\n    I, <i>{full legal name}</i> ______________________________________, Respondent,\nbeing sworn, certify that the following information is true:\n                       ANSWER TO PETITION\n1.

The Parenting Plan must be developed and agreed to by the parents and approved by the court. If the parties cannot agree to a Parenting Plan or if the parents agreed to a plan that is not approved by the court, a Parenting Plan will be established by the court with or without the use of parenting plan recommendations. This form or a similar form should be used in the development of a Parenting Plan. If the case involves supervised time-sharing, the Safety Focused Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(b) or a similar form should be used. If the case involves relocation, pursuant to Section 61.13001, Florida Statutes, then a Relocation/Long Distance Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(c) or a similar form should be used.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. Please either delete or strike-through terms or paragraphs that are inappropriate or in applicable to your agreement. If an agreement has been reached, both parties must sign the Parenting Plan and have their signatures witnessed by a notary public or deputy clerk. After completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records. You should then refer to the instructions for your petition, answer, or answer and counterpetition concerning the procedures for setting a hearing or trial (final hearing). If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed by either parent at the time of or any time prior to the final hearing. If an agreed Parenting Plan is not filed by the parties, the court shall establish a Plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read \"General Information for Self-Represented Litigants\" found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in \"bold underline\" in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes, and the instructions for the petition and/or answer that were filed in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes ...</h2>\n<p>At a minimum, the Parenting Plan must describe in adequate detail:</p>\n<p>Â• How the parties will share and be responsible for the daily tasks associated with the upbringing of the child(ren),</p>\n<p>Â• The time-sharing schedule arrangements that specify the time that the minor child(ren) will spend with each parent,</p>\n<p>Â• A designation of who will be responsible for any and all forms of health care, school-related matters, including the address to be used for school-boundary determination and registration, other activities, and</p>\n<p>Â• The methods and technologies that the parents will use to communicate with the child(ren).</p>\n<p>The best interests of the child(ren) is the primary consideration in the Parenting Plan. In creating the Parenting Plan, all circumstances between the parents, including their historic relationship, domestic violence, and other factors must be taken into consideration. Determination of the best interests <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1266</span> of the child(ren) shall be made by evaluating all of the factors affecting the welfare and interest of the particular minor child(ren) and the circumstances of that family, as listed in section 61.13(3), Florida Statutes, including, but not limited to:</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship, to honor the time-sharing schedule, and to be reasonable when changes are required;</p>\n<p>Â• The anticipated division of parental responsibilities after the litigation, including the extent to which parental responsibilities will be delegated to third parties;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to determine, consider, and act upon the needs of the child(ren) as opposed to the needs or desires of the parent;</p>\n<p>Â• The length of time the child(ren) has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity;</p>\n<p>Â• The geographic viability of the parenting plan, with special attention paid to the needs of school-age children and the amount of time to be spent traveling to effectuate the parenting plan. This factor does not create a presumption for or against relocation of either parent with a child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The moral fitness of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The mental and physical health of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The home, school, and community record of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The reasonable preference of the child(ren), if the court deems the child(ren) to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated knowledge, capacity, and disposition of each parent to be informed of the circumstances of the minor child(ren), including, but not limited to, the child(ren)'s friends, teachers, medical care providers, daily activities, and favorite things;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to provide a consistent routine for the child(ren), such as discipline, and daily schedules for homework, meals, and bedtime;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity of each parent to communicate with and keep the other parent informed of issues and activities regarding the minor child(ren), and the willingness of each parent to adopt a unified front on all major issues when dealing with the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence of domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, regardless of whether a prior or pending action relating to those issues has been brought. If the court accepts evidence of prior or pending actions regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, the court must specifically acknowledge in writing that such evidence was considered when evaluating the best interests of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence that either parent has knowingly provided false information to the court regarding any prior or pending action regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect;</p>\n<p>Â• The particular parenting tasks customarily performed by each parent and the division or parental responsibilities before the institution of litigation and during the pending litigation, including the extent to which parenting responsibilities were undertaken by third parties;</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1267</span> Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to participate and be involved in the child(ren)'s school and extracurricular activities;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to maintain an environment for the child(ren) which is free from substance abuse;</p>\n<p>Â• The capacity and disposition of each parent to protect the child(ren) from the ongoing litigation as demonstrated by not discussing the litigation with the child(ren), not sharing documents or electronic media related to the litigation with the child(ren), and refraining from disparaging comments about the other parent to the child(ren); and</p>\n<p>Â• The developmental stages and needs of the child(ren) and the demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to meet the child(ren)'s developmental needs.</p>\n<p>This standard form does not include every possible issue that may be relevant to the facts of your case. The Parenting Plan should be as detailed as possible to address the time-sharing schedule. Additional provisions should be added to address all of the relevant factors.

This form or a similar form should be used in cases when you feel your child(ren) cannot be safely alone with the other parent or if you believe shared parental responsibility presents a detriment to the child(ren). In this case, a Parenting Plan must be developed that allows time-sharing with any minor child(ren), while providing protection for the child(ren). If safety or supervised time-sharing is not a concern, Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a) or a similar form should be used. If the case involves relocation, pursuant to Section 61.13001, Florida Statutes, then Relocation/Long Distance Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(c) or a similar form should be used. The Parenting Plan must be developed and agreed to by the parents and approved by the court. If the parties cannot agree to a Parenting Plan or if the parents agreed to a plan that is not approved by the court, a parenting plan will be established by the court with or without the use of parenting plan recommendations.</p>\n<p>This form should be typed or printed in black ink. If an agreement has been reached, both parties must sign the Parenting Plan and have their signatures witnessed by a notary public or deputy clerk. After completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records. You should then refer to the instructions for your petition, answer, or answer and counterpetition concerning the procedures for setting a hearing or trial (final hearing). If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed by either parent at the time of or any time prior to the final hearing. If an agreed Parenting Plan is not filed by the parties, the court shall establish a Plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where can I look for more information?</h2>\n<p>Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes, and the instructions for the petition and/or answer that were filed in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Special notes...</h2>\n<p>If you fear that disclosing your address would put you in danger, you should complete a Request for Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Form 12.980(h), file it with the clerk of the circuit court and write confidential in the space provided in the Parenting Plan.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, the Parenting Plan must describe in adequate detail:</p>\n<p>Â• How the parties will share and be responsible for the daily tasks associated with the upbringing of the child(ren),</p>\n<p>Â• The time-sharing schedule arrangements that specify the time that the minor child(ren) will spend with each parent,</p>\n<p>Â• A designation of who will be responsible for any and all forms of health care, school-related matters, including the address to be used for school-boundary determination and registration, other activities, and</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1282</span> Â• The methods and technologies that the parents will use to communicate with the child(ren).</p>\n<p>The best interests of the child(ren) is the primary consideration in the Parenting Plan. In creating the Parenting Plan, all circumstances between the parents, including their historic relationship, domestic violence, and other factors must be taken into consideration. Determination of the best interests of the child(ren) shall be made by evaluating all of the factors affecting the welfare and interest of the particular minor child(ren) and the circumstances of that family, as listed in section 61.13(3), Florida Statutes, including, but not limited to:</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship, to honor the time-sharing schedule, and to be reasonable when changes are required;</p>\n<p>Â• The anticipated division of parental responsibilities after the litigation, including the extent to which parental responsibilities will be delegated to third parties;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to determine, consider, and act upon the needs of the child(ren) as opposed to the needs or desires of the parent;</p>\n<p>Â• The length of time the child(ren) has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity;</p>\n<p>Â• The geographic viability of the parenting plan, with special attention paid to the needs of school-age children and the amount of time to be spent traveling to effectuate the parenting plan. This factor does not create a presumption for or against relocation of either parent with a child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The moral fitness of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The mental and physical health of the parents;</p>\n<p>Â• The home, school, and community record of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• The reasonable preference of the child(ren), if the court deems the child(ren) to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated knowledge, capacity, and disposition of each parent to be informed of the circumstances of the minor child(ren), including, but not limited to, the child(ren)'s friends, teachers, medical care providers, daily activities, and favorite things;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to provide a consistent routine for the child(ren), such as discipline, and daily schedules for homework, meals, and bedtime;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity of each parent to communicate with and keep the other parent informed of issues and activities regarding the minor child(ren), and the willingness of each parent to adopt a unified front on all major issues when dealing with the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence of domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, regardless of whether a prior or pending action relating to those issues has been brought. If the court accepts evidence of prior or pending actions regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, the court must specifically acknowledge, in writing that such evidence was considered when evaluating the bests interests of the child(ren);</p>\n<p>Â• Evidence that either parent has knowingly provided false information to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1283</span> court regarding any prior or pending action regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect;</p>\n<p>Â• The particular parenting tasks customarily performed by each parent and the division of parental responsibilities before the institution of litigation and during the pending litigation, including the extent to which parenting responsibilities were undertaken by third parties;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to participate and be involved in the child(ren)'s school and extracurricular activities;</p>\n<p>Â• The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to maintain an environment for the child(ren) which is free from substance abuse;</p>\n<p>Â• The capacity and disposition of each parent to protect the child(ren) from the ongoing litigation as demonstrated by not discussing the litigation with the child(ren), not sharing documents or electronic media related to the litigation with the child(ren), and refraining from disparaging comments about the other parent to the child)ren); and</p>\n<p>Â• The developmental stages and needs of the child(ren) and the demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to meet the child(ren)'s developmental needs.</p>\n<p>This standard form does not include every possible issue that may be relevant to the facts of your case. The Parenting Plan should be as detailed as possible to address the time-sharing schedule. Additional provisions should be added to address all of the relevant factors. The parties should give special consideration to the age and needs of each child.</p>\n<p>In developing the Parenting Plan, you may wish to consult or review other materials which are available at your local library, law library or through national and state family organizations.</p>\n<p>Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.

Order AOSC06-27 at 3.</p>\n<p>[14]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Amends. to Fla. Rules of App. Pro.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572342\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572342/in-re-amendments-to-rules-of-appellate-procedure/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 90 n. 1 (Fla.2008) (stating that proposed new rule 9.050 (Maintaining Privacy of Personal Data) was referred to Access Committee).</p>\n<p>[15]  <i>See</i> Admin. Order No. AOSC09-3.</p>\n<p>[16]  Subdivision (b) of the rule, which we adopt on an interim basis, exempts filings in criminal and traffic proceedings.</p>\n<p>[17]  Privacy Committee Report, Recommendation Seven, at 53.</p>\n<p>[18]  The Court previously adopted a number of amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 (Public Access to Judicial Branch Records) also proposed by the Access Committee to implement other Privacy Committee recommendations. <i>See </i><i>In re Amends. to Fla. Rule of Jud. Admin. 2.420 &amp; Fla. Rules of App. Pro.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1581877\"><a href=\"/opinion/1581877/in-re-amend-to-rule-of-jud-admin-2420/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span> (amending Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 to provide comprehensive procedures for identifying and segregating confidential information in court records, for sealing and unsealing court records, and for reviewing orders issued under the rule.)</p>\n<p>[19]  The phrase \"or authorized by statute, another rule, or court order\" is meant to clarify that conflicting provisions of another rule of court, a statute, or a court order will control over the rule 2.425 requirements.</p>\n<p>[20]  In proposing this prohibition, the Rules of Judicial Administration Committee recognized that the standard business and banking practice is to use the last four digits of such numbers, but the committee determined it would be best to completely preclude the filing of such numbers because of their confidential status under rule 2.420(d)(1)(B)(iii). We agree that these highly sensitive and otherwise confidential personal identifying numbers should not be filed, unless exempt from the rule 2.425(a) limitations as provided in the rule.</p>\n<p>[21]  The composite comments of the Florida criminal justice organizations filed in this case include comments or resolutions in support of the exemption from the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Miami-Dade County Association of Chiefs of Police, the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, the Florida Public Defender Association, Inc., and the Florida Bar Criminal Law Section.</p>\n<p>[22]  The Criminal Procedure Rules Committee should oversee this project, and the committees' joint report should be filed with the Court by December 1, 2011.</p>\n<p>[23]  The Small Claims Rules Committee declined to offer conforming amendments to the Small Claims Rules. Rather, that committee asks the Court to postpone amending the Small Claims Rules until the committee has an opportunity to consider the version of rule 2.425 the Court adopts. Therefore, we defer adoption of pending amendments to the Small Claim Rules that are impacted by the adoption of rule 2.425 and have directed the Small Claims Rules Committee to use its fast-track procedures to file a report with conforming rule amendments by September 1, 2011. However, we adopt other pending amendments to the Small Claims Rules that will limit the filing of unnecessary personal information but are not directly affected by the adoption of new rule 2.425. They are new rule 7.140(e)(3), which requires the judge to assist an unrepresented party in the handling of private information, and forms 7.340 (Final Judgment) and 7.373 (Fact Information Sheet), which are amended to instruct that the Fact Information Sheet should not be filed with the Court.\n</p>\n<p>We ask that in the future, when the Court seeks proposed rule amendments to address a given topic from a number of rules committees, each committee comply with the Court's request and individual committees not decline to act until proposals from other committees are acted upon. <i>See, e.g., In re Amends. to Fla. Rules of Jud. Admin., Fla. Rules of Civil Pro., Fla. Rules of Crim. Pro., Fla. Rules of Civil Pro. for Involuntary Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators, Fla. Probate Rules, Fla. Rules of Traffic Court, Fla. Rules of Juv. Pro., Fla. Rules of App. Pro., &amp; Fla. Family Law Rules of Pro.-Computation of Time,</i> No. SC10-2299 (Fla. Petition filed Dec. 13, 2010) (Small Claims Rules Committee declining to propose amendments to Small Claims Rules until proposed Rule of Judicial Administration governing computation of time is adopted by the Court). Addressing all related proposals at the same time ensures consistency and conserves valuable judicial resources.</p>\n<p>[24]  Although the general provisions of new rule 2.425 prohibit the inclusion of any portion of a social security number in a court filing, as noted above, requirements in other rules or forms, such as the requirement that the last four digits of a social security number be included in certain documents, control over conflicting requirements in the new rule.</p>\n<p>[25]  We decline to adopt amendments to rules 3.211(c) (Competence to Proceed: Scope of Examination; Written Findings of Experts), 3.212(d) (Competence to Proceed: Hearing and Disposition; Release of Finding of Incompetence), 3.218(a) (Commitment of a Defendant Found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity; Commitment; 6-Month Report), and 3.219(a) (Conditional Release; Release Plan) suggested by the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee. Instead, we amend those rules to provide: \"The procedure for determinations of the confidential status of reports is governed by Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420.\" Further amendments to rule 2.420(d), which are urged in this case, were considered in In re Amends. to the Fla.
