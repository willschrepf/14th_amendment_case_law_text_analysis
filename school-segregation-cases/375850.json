In 2010 they sued the State of Montana, complaining\n\nthat they are unable to obtain protections and benefits that are available to similarly-\n\nsituated different-sex couples who marry under State law. Plaintiffs expressly do not\n\nchallenge Montana law’s restriction of marriage to heterosexual couples, do not seek the\n\nopportunity to marry, and do not seek the designation of marriage for their relationships.\n\nThey contend however that there is a “statutory structure” in Montana law that prohibits\n\nthem from enjoying “significant relationship and family protections and obligations\n\nautomatically provided to similarly-situated different-sex couples who marry.”\n\f¶2     Plaintiffs contend that this statutory structure interferes with their rights under\n\nArticle II of the Montana Constitution, including their rights to equal protection, due\n\nprocess, and the rights to privacy, dignity and the pursuit of life’s necessities. They seek\n\na declaration that the State’s failure to provide them access to the statutory scheme\n\navailable to different-sex couples denies them the rights guaranteed by Article II. They\n\nseek an injunction prohibiting the State from continuing to deny them access to the\n\nstatutory scheme.\n\n¶3     The District Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and granted\n\nthe State’s motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The District Court noted that\n\nPlaintiffs do not seek a declaration that any specific statutes are unconstitutional. The\n\nDistrict Court concluded that granting the relief sought—ordering the Legislature to enact\n\na statutory scheme to address Plaintiffs’ goals of achieving equal treatment—would be an\n\ninappropriate exercise of judicial power. Doing so, according to the District Court,\n\nwould run afoul of the separation of powers required by Article III, section 1 of the\n\nMontana Constitution.\n\n¶4     The District Court was also concerned that granting broad declaratory relief would\n\nlikely impact a large number of statutes in potentially unknown and unintended ways. In\n\nthe District Court proceedings Plaintiffs parenthetically listed a number of Montana\n\nstatutes that they contend are within the “statutory scheme” that denies them equal access\n\nto rights and responsibilities. The District Court concluded, however that “what plaintiffs\n\nwant here is not a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a specific statute or set of\n\nstatutes but rather a direction to the legislature to enact a statutory arrangement.” The\n\n                                             2\n\fDistrict Court determined that while this had some appeal, such relief was\n\n“unprecedented and uncharted in Montana law.” The District Court concluded that “the\n\nproper ways to deal with Plaintiffs’ concerns are specific suits directed at specific,\n\nidentifiable statutes.” Plaintiffs appealed after the District Court denied their motion to\n\nalter or amend.\n\n¶5     On appeal Plaintiffs argue, without reference to specific statutes, that they are\n\n“excluded from the statutory scheme of benefits and obligations the state has associated\n\nexclusively with marriage.” Plaintiffs contend that a strict level of review is required, but\n\nthat even at the lowest levels of constitutional scrutiny the State cannot show a legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest in the current statutory scheme, and that it violates their rights\n\nunder Article II of the Montana Constitution. Plaintiffs contend that the State excludes\n\nthem from access to unnamed benefits and obligations in violation of Montana’s\n\nconstitutional rights of privacy, dignity and the pursuit of life’s basic necessities.\n\nPlaintiffs contend that they are entitled to a declaratory judgment and to injunctive relief\n\nto redress the violation of their rights. Plaintiffs contend that while they can obtain relief\n\nwithout a judicial order requiring the Legislature to act, such an order is a remedy well\n\nwithin established constitutional bounds.\n\n¶6     Plaintiffs ask that the judgment of the District Court be reversed and the case\n\nremanded to grant Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as well as a declaratory\n\njudgment and injunction. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f¶7     As a general rule, this Court will not disturb a district court’s determination that\n\ndeclaratory relief is not necessary or proper unless the district court abused its discretion.\n\nMiller v. State Farm, 2007 MT 85, ¶ 5, 337 Mont. 67, 155 P.3d 1278 (citing Northfield\n\nIns. v. Mont. Assoc. of Counties, 2000 MT 256, ¶ 8, 301 Mont. 472, 10 P.3d 813). We\n\nreview a district court’s interpretation of law to determine whether the interpretation is\n\ncorrect. Miller, ¶ 5.\n\n¶8     In the past Montana courts have held specific statutes unconstitutional, and in\n\nsome cases have directed the Legislature to act to comply with specific duties. Helena\n\nElementary School Dist. No. 1 v. State, 236 Mont. 44, 769 P.2d 864 (school funding);\n\nSnetsinger v. Mont. Univ. System, 2004 MT 390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445 (provision\n\nof employment benefits).       In the present case, however, Plaintiffs do not seek a\n\ndeclaration that any particular statute is unconstitutional or that its implementation should\n\nbe enjoined. Rather, Plaintiffs seek a general declaration of their rights and seek orders\n\nenjoining the State to provide them a “legal status and statutory structure” that protects\n\ntheir rights.\n\n¶9     We agree with the District Court that Plaintiffs’ requested relief exceeds the\n\nbounds of a justiciable controversy, Gryczan v. State, 283 Mont. 433, 442, 942 P.2d 112,\n\n117 (1997), and decline to provide the declaratory relief requested. It is the opinion of\n\nthis Court that the broad injunction and declaratory judgment sought by Plaintiffs would\n\nnot terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding. Instead, a\n\nbroad injunction and declaration not specifically directed at any particular statute would\n\nlead to confusion and further litigation. As the District Court aptly stated: “For this\n\n                                              4\n\fCourt to direct the legislature to enact a law that would impact an unknown number of\n\nstatutes would launch this Court into a roiling maelstrom of policy issues without a\n\nconstitutional compass.” A district court may refuse to enter a declaratory judgment if it\n\nwould not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceedings, § 27-8-\n\n206, MCA; Miller, ¶ 7. Courts do not function, even under the Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct, to determine speculative matters, to enter anticipatory judgments, to declare social\n\nstatus, to give advisory opinions or to give abstract opinions. Mont. Dept. Nat. Res. &\n\nCons. v. Intake Water Co., 171 Mont. 416, 440, 558 P.2d 1110, 1123 (1976).\n\n¶10    In addition, declaring the parameters of constitutional rights is a serious matter.\n\nThis Court, for example, avoids deciding constitutional issues whenever possible.\n\nWeidow v. Uninsured Employers’ Fund, 2010 MT 292, ¶ 22, 359 Mont. 77, 246 P.3d\n\n704. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional. Oberson v. U.S. Forest Service, 2007\n\nMT 293, ¶ 14, 339 Mont. 519, 171 P.3d 715. That presumption can only be overcome\n\nafter careful consideration of the purpose and effect of the statute, employing the proper\n\nlevel of scrutiny. Oberson, ¶ 22 (analyzing the constitutionality of the snowmobile\n\nliability statute, § 23-2-653, MCA).      Broadly determining the constitutionality of a\n\n“statutory scheme” that may, according to Plaintiffs, involve hundreds of separate\n\nstatutes, is contrary to established jurisprudence.\n\n¶11    This Court may fashion the relief warranted by any appeal. Section 3-2-204,\n\nMCA. It is this Court’s opinion that Plaintiffs should be given the opportunity, if they\n\nchoose to take it, to amend the complaint and to refine and specify the general\n\nconstitutional challenges they have proffered. For example, the record contains several\n\n                                              5\n\faffidavits from the named Plaintiffs and others that assert that they have suffered\n\ndiscrimination from the State’s failure to recognize their relationships. While Plaintiffs’\n\nbrief listed Title 40 of the Montana Code as an area of family law that furthers such\n\ndiscrimination, the dismissal of this action because of Plaintiffs’ broad claims has\n\nprecluded the development of claims that specific statutes promote or cause\n\ndiscrimination. These are important issues and should be decided only after the statutes\n\ninvolved are specifically identified and specifically analyzed in district court proceedings.\n\n¶12    Montana law generally favors allowing a party to amend its pleadings. Rule 15,\n\nM. R. Civ. P.; Hobble-Diamond Cattle Co. v. Triangle Irrig. Co., 249 Mont. 322, 325,\n\n815 P.2d 1153, 1155 (1991); Aldrich & Co. v. Ellis, 2002 MT 177, ¶ 27, 311 Mont. 1, 52\n\nP.3d 388 (remand to allow plaintiff to add claim). The purpose of amending a complaint\n\nis to give the defendant adequate notice of the plaintiff’s claims. Kudloff v. City of\n\nBillings, 260 Mont. 371, 375, 860 P.2d 140, 142 (1993). The decision to allow a plaintiff\n\nto amend a complaint is essentially an equitable one. Stundal v. Stundal, 2000 MT 21, ¶\n\n17, 298 Mont. 141, 995 P.2d 420, and leave to amend may be denied when the\n\namendment would be futile or legally insufficient. Hickey v. Baker School Dist. No. 12,\n\n2002 MT 322, ¶ 33, 313 Mont. 162, 60 P.3d 966.\n\n¶13    The Plaintiffs should be afforded the opportunity to amend their complaint and to\n\ndevelop an argument as to the nature of the State’s interest in advancing specific laws as\n\nwell as the level of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to those laws by the\n\ncourts. Plaintiffs of course may choose to not amend, and that decision is theirs to make.\n\nIf they do amend they will need to choose what statute or statutes to put in issue and upon\n\n                                             6\n\fwhat legal grounds. The dissent may be disappointed in the majority’s approach to this\n\ncase. However, that does not change the fact that the Plaintiffs chose to pursue an overly\n\nbroad request for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, without developing a\n\nfactual record in the District Court and without identifying a specific statute or statutes\n\nthat impose the discrimination they allege.\n\n¶14    For the reasons set out above, the decision of the District Court is affirmed in part,\n\nreversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, in a\n\nschedule to be determined by the District Court.\n\n¶15    The Clerk is directed to provide copies hereof to all counsel of record and to the\n\nHonorable Jeffrey M. Sherlock, District Judge.\n\n       DATED this 17th day of December, 2012.\n\n\n                                                                /S/ MIKE McGRATH\n                                                                /S/ BETH BAKER\n                                                                /S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n                                                                /S/ JIM RICE\n\n\n\n\nJustice Jim Rice, concurring.\n\n¶16    I join in the Court’s decision affirming the District Court. I agree with the Court\n\nand the District Court that the remedy sought in Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief—that the\n\ncourt issue an order requiring the State to offer Plaintiffs “a legal status and statutory\n\nstructure that confers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-\n\nsex couples who marry”—is overly broad and not justiciable. Opinion, ¶ 8. Further, I\n\n                                              7\n\fhave no objection to remanding the case to allow Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their\n\npleadings to start the case anew. Opinion, ¶¶ 12-13. This is the procedural equivalent to\n\nfiling a different legal challenge after dismissal of a case, which the Plaintiffs are entitled\n\nto pursue. Thus, I have signed the Court’s Opinion.\n\n¶17    I write separately to address the District Court’s analysis of the Marriage\n\nAmendment to the Montana Constitution, and to explain the Amendment’s application to\n\nPlaintiffs’ substantive equal protection contentions set forth in Count I of their complaint.\n\nI believe that the Amendment provides another basis to affirm the District Court’s\n\ndismissal of Count I, in addition to the overly broad nature of the relief sought.\n\n¶18    The District Court reasoned that, while “this Court does not necessarily feel that\n\nMontana’s marriage amendment bars it from acting,” nonetheless “the existence of the\n\nmarriage amendment plays into the jurisprudential decision that Plaintiffs’ requested\n\nrelief constitutes an impermissible sojourn into the powers of the legislative branch.” I\n\nagree that the Marriage Amendment is applicable, but believe the District Court\n\nunderstated its significance.     With its passage, the law’s historical designation of\n\nmarriage as between a man and a woman—and the exclusive treatment premised\n\nthereon—became an expressly constitutional classification.\n\n¶19    Count I alleges that “Plaintiffs are similarly situated in every material respect to []\n\ndifferent-sex couples” and that the State’s exclusion of Plaintiffs from the benefits and\n\nobligations “that the State offers to similarly-situated different-sex couples through the\n\nlegal status of marriage impermissibly subjects Plaintiffs to unequal treatment” and\n\nconstitutes “State discrimination.” With all due respect to Plaintiffs, I believe their equal\n\n                                              8\n\fprotection claim must fail under longstanding and deeply rooted legal principles, in both\n\nMontana and national jurisprudence. Under the law, discussed below, marriage between\n\na man and woman is a unique relationship, dissimilar to all other relationships and alone\n\nessential to the nation’s foundation and survival, and the State errs neither by recognizing\n\nit as such nor by giving it exclusive treatment. In sum, it is not discrimination to treat\n\nuniquely that which is unique.\n\n¶20    Plaintiffs emphasize that they are not seeking the right to marry, but nonetheless\n\nclaim in Count I that they are entitled to all of the “protections, rights, benefits, duties,\n\nresponsibilities, and obligations” which the State grants based upon marriage. During\n\noral argument, Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that the relief sought would strip from\n\nthe law the exclusive treatment of marriage as a basis for providing any concrete legal\n\nbenefit.   The only exclusive meaning left to marriage, counsel said, would be\n\naspirational: “How people view it, how symbolic and how important and how solemn it\n\nis.” The question thus posed by Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is whether the State is\n\nbarred by the Constitution from using marriage as an exclusive basis for granting any\n\nconcrete legal entitlement.\n\n¶21    As we have explained, “[t]he first step in an equal protection analysis is to\n\n‘identify the classes involved, and determine if they are similarly situated.’” Jaksha v.\n\nSilver Bow Co., 2009 MT 263, ¶ 16, 352 Mont. 46, 214 P.3d 1248 (citation omitted). “‘If\n\nthe classes are not similarly situated, then . . . it is not necessary for us to analyze the\n\nchallenge further.’” Kershaw v. Dept. of Transp., 2011 MT 170, ¶ 17, 361 Mont. 215,\n\n257 P.3d 358. The classes here have been identified as same-sex couples, represented by\n\n                                             9\n\fPlaintiffs, and married couples. To analyze whether these classes are similarly situated, I\n\nbegin by summarizing the extensive jurisprudence on the issue of marriage, particularly,\n\nas it stood when Montanans were asked to adopt the Marriage Amendment, and then turn\n\nto the Amendment itself.\n\n¶22    It is so well established that marriage between a man and a woman is a\n\nfundamental constitutional right I need not belabor the point. See Turner v. Safley, 482\n\nU.S. 78, 95, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 2265 (1987) (“[T]he decision to marry is a fundamental\n\nright”); Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384, 98 S. Ct. 673, 680 (1978) (quoting Meyer\n\nv. Neb., 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 626 (1923)) (“the right ‘to marry, establish a\n\nhome and bring up children’ is a central part of the liberty protected by the Due Process\n\nClause”); Conaway v. Deane, 932 A.2d 571, 618 n. 63 (Md. 2007) (citations omitted) (“It\n\nis beyond doubt that the right to marry is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the\n\nConstitution.”). Likewise, this Court has stated, “[w]e too have recognized that marriage\n\nis a fundamental right.” State v. Guill, 2011 MT 32, ¶ 66, 359 Mont. 225, 248 P.3d 826. 1\n\n¶23    Marriage between a man and woman has been declared a fundamental right\n\nbecause of the critical functions it performs and the purposes it fulfills for the greater\n\nsociety. “[M]arriage involves interests of basic importance in our society.” Boddie v.\n\nConn., 401 U.S. 371, 376, 91 S. Ct. 780, 785 (1971) (citations omitted). Marriage is “the\n\nrelationship that is the foundation of the family in our society.” Zablocki, 434 U.S. at\n\n386, 98 S. Ct. at 681. Maintenance of marriage is an issue in which “the public is deeply\n\n1\n See also Loving v. Va., 388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 1824 (1967); Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.\nLaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 639-40, 94 S. Ct. 791, 795 (1974); Montgomery v. Carr, 101 F.3d 1117,\n1124 (6th Cir. 1996).\n                                              10\n\finterested, for it is the foundation of the family and of society, without which there would\n\nbe neither civilization nor progress.” Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 210-11, 8 S. Ct.\n\n723, 729 (1888). Our Court has explained that “upon [marriage’s] permanence depends\n\nthe family, the foundation of the home, ‘upon the preservation of which, in turn, depends\n\ngood citizenship and the permanency of a republican form of government.’” Walker v.\n\nHill, 90 Mont. 111, 124, 300 P. 260, 263-64 (1931) (citations omitted); accord Franklin\n\nv. Franklin, 40 Mont. 348, 350, 106 P. 353, 354 (1910) (Upon marriage “depends the\n\nhome, upon the preservation of which, in turn, depends good citizenship and the\n\npermanency of a republican form of government.                The state therefore favors the\n\ninstitution of marriage”). “Marriage is a foundation stone in the bedrock of our state and\n\ncommunities.” Cook v. Cook, 104 P.3d 857, 862, ¶ 18 (Ariz. App. Div. 1 2005). 2\n\n¶24    Beyond these reasons of family, societal stability, governance and progress, as\n\nimportant as they are, courts analyzing marriage have focused upon even more\n\ncompelling reasons:      its exclusive role in procreation and in insuring the survival,\n\nprotection and thriving of the human race.           Marriage is “‘fundamental to our very\n\nexistence and survival.’” Guill, ¶ 66 (quoting Loving v. Va., 388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S. Ct.\n\n1817, 1824 (1967)). “Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence\n\nand survival of the race.” Skinner v. Okla. ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.\n2\n  See also Maynard, 125 U.S. at 211-12, 8 S. Ct. at 730 (quoting Adams v. Palmer, 51 Me. 480,\n485 (Me. 1863)) (marriage is “a ‘relation the most important . . . the first step from barbarism to\nincipient civilization, the purest tie of social life and the true basis of human progress’”);\nGriswold v. Conn., 381 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 1682 (1965) (“Marriage is a coming\ntogether for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.\nIt is an association . . . . for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.”);\nReynolds v. U.S., 98 U.S. 145, 165 (1879) (“Upon [marriage] . . . society may be said to be\nbuilt”).\n                                                11\n\fCt. 1110, 1113 (1942). “[V]irtually every [U.S.] Supreme Court case recognizing as\n\nfundamental the right to marry indicates as the basis for the conclusion the institution’s\n\ninextricable link to procreation, which necessarily and biologically involves participation\n\n(in ways either intimate or remote) by a man and a woman.” Conaway v. Deane, 932\n\nA.2d 571, 621 (Md. 2007). “All of the cases infer that the right to marry enjoys its\n\nfundamental status due to the male-female nature of the relationship and/or the attendant\n\nlink to fostering procreation of our species.” Conaway, 932 A.2d at 619 (citing the\n\nSupreme Court’s holdings in Loving, Zablocki, Turner, and Skinner).\n\n¶25    From procreation springs further societal protections provided exclusively by\n\nmarriage. As noted above, courts have cited the raising of children to be one of the core\n\nfunctions which support constitutional protection of marriage. See Meyer v. Neb., 262\n\nU.S. at 399, 43 S. Ct. at 626; see also Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 186 (Minn.\n\n1971), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. 37 (1972) (“The institution of marriage\n\nas a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children\n\nwithin a family, is as old as the book of Genesis.”) (emphasis added). Married couples\n\nrole-model and thereby teach procreative relationships and the procreative lifestyle to\n\nchildren of the marriage as they are raised, ensuring that marriage’s human\n\nrace-sustaining functions upon which the survival and stability of society depend are\n\npassed to and replicated by the next generation.\n\n¶26    The replication, by children, of the procreative marital relationship as\n\nrole-modeled by their married parents not only perpetuates the race-sustaining function\n\nby populating the race, but also builds extended families which share hereditary\n\n                                            12\n\fcharacteristics of a common gene pool. Throughout history, this genetic commonality\n\nhas provided an invaluable tool to enhance human survival. Common hereditary traits\n\nprovide critical understanding of an extended family’s physical and mental strengths,\n\nweaknesses, and susceptibility to disease and death. Even before the advent of modern\n\nscience, this information was collectively shared among extended family members and\n\nserved to alert and prepare them for eventualities related to the onset of disease and other\n\nlife patterns, thus strengthening their health and livelihood.           Modern medical\n\ntechnologies have only increased this capability, as research of an extended family’s\n\ngenetics now serves to predict, detect, and treat common, family-related diseases, further\n\nenhancing human survival.\n\n¶27    Upon extended families are built people groups or ethnic groups of individual\n\nraces, tribes, kindred, and nationalities based upon their broadly shared genetic\n\ncharacteristics. In addition to developing understanding about their mutually shared\n\nhealth risks, people groups throughout history have looked outward to their physical\n\nsurroundings and, based upon their common genetics and collective experiences, have\n\nobtained the knowledge necessary for their people to adapt to and function well in the\n\nphysical environment, thus enhancing their health and longevity. People groups around\n\nthe world have been linked to make up the larger human race. While world customs and\n\ncultures vary greatly, these societies share the common foundational element of a woman\n\nand a man united in marriage. It is little wonder the Supreme Court has said that\n\nmarriage is “fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.” Zablocki, 434\n\nU.S. at 384 (citing Skinner, 316 U.S. at 541).        One court well summed up these\n\n                                            13\n\fprinciples: “[T]he State has a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of\n\nmarriage (whether based on self-preservation, procreation, or in nurturing and keeping\n\nalive the concept of marriage and family as a basic fabric of our society), as old and as\n\nfundamental as our entire civilization, which institution is deeply rooted and long\n\nestablished in firm and rich societal values.” In re Estate of Cooper, 564 N.Y.S.2d 684,\n\n688 (N.Y. Surrog. Ct. 1990); see also Conaway, 932 A.2d at 630 (“In light of the\n\nfundamental nature of procreation, and the importance placed on it by the Supreme\n\nCourt, safeguarding an environment most conducive to the stable propagation and\n\ncontinuance of the human race is a legitimate government interest.”).\n\n¶28    These principles demonstrate clearly that marriage is not merely a private act. It is\n\nalso a public act which serves a public function critical to society, that of bringing\n\ntogether female and male to create and raise the future generation.             Courts have\n\nrecognized this, holding that the above-discussed critical societal functions are uniquely\n\nprovided by marriage between a woman and man and cannot be replicated by other\n\nrelationships. 3 “Because only relationships between opposite-sex couples can naturally\n\nproduce children, it is reasonable for the state to afford unique legal recognition to that\n\nparticular social unit in the form of opposite-sex marriage.          The legislature could\n\nreasonably conclude that the institution of civil marriage as it has existed in the country\n\nfrom the beginning has successfully provided this desirable social structure and should be\n\npreserved.” In re J.B., 326 S.W.3d 654, 677 (Tex. App. Dallas 2010) (internal citations\n\n3\n  Because this case does not involve an equal protection challenge as between married and\nunmarried heterosexual couples, I do not here focus on or develop an analysis regarding the\ndistinctions between them.\n                                             14\n\fomitted). “Indisputably, the only sexual relationship capable of producing children is one\n\nbetween a man and a woman. The State could reasonably decide that by encouraging\n\nopposite-sex couples to marry, thereby assuming legal and financial obligations, the\n\nchildren born from such relationships will have better opportunities to be nurtured and\n\nraised by two parents within long-term, committed relationships, which society has\n\ntraditionally viewed as advantageous for children. Because same-sex couples cannot by\n\nthemselves procreate, the State could also reasonably decide that sanctioning same-sex\n\nmarriages would do little to advance the State’s interest in ensuring responsible\n\nprocreation within committed, long-term relationships.” Standhardt v. Super. Ct. of\n\nAriz., 77 P.3d 451, 462-63, ¶ 38 (Ariz. App. Div. 1 2003) (emphasis added); see also\n\nCitizens for Equal Protec. v. Bruning, 455 F.3d 859, 868 (8th Cir. 2006) (“[Appellees’]\n\nargument disregards the expressed intent of traditional marriage laws—to encourage\n\nheterosexual couples to bear and raise children in committed marriage relationships.”). 4\n\n“[S]o far as heterosexuals are concerned, the evidence that on average married couples\n\nlive longer, are healthier, earn more, have lower rates of substance abuse and mental\n\nillness, are less likely to commit suicide, and report higher levels of happiness—that\n\nmarriage civilizes young males, confers economies of scale and of joint consumption,\n\nminimizes sexually transmitted disease, and provides a stable and nourishing framework\n\n4\n  While not all heterosexual couples have the ability or desire to procreate and raise children, the\njurisprudence is premised upon the potential of producing children which lies within the\nmarriage structure and the state’s interest, as stated here, in “encourag[ing]” these outcomes.\nCitizens for Equal Protec., 455 F.3d at 868. “The fundamental right to marriage and its ensuing\nbenefits are conferred on opposite-sex couples not because of a distinction between whether\nvarious opposite-sex couples actually procreate, but rather because of the possibility of\nprocreation.” Conaway, 932 A.2d at 633.\n                                                15\n\ffor child rearing—refutes any claim that policies designed to promote marriage are\n\nirrational.” Irizarry v. Bd. of Educ. of Chicago, 251 F.3d 604, 607 (7th Cir. 2001)\n\n(citations omitted).    Modern medicine makes it technologically possible for some\n\nsame-sex couples to artificially conceive and bear children. However, that fact does not\n\ndiminish the truth that human life cannot be sustained without procreative marriage\n\nrelationships, even in light of modern technology.\n\n¶29    Consequently, the right to marry has not been held to mean there is a fundamental\n\nright to marry someone of the same gender. “[V]irtually every court to have considered\n\nthe issue has held that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected as fundamental\n\nin either their state or the Nation as a whole.” Conaway, 932 A.2d at 628 (citations\n\nomitted). “The idea that same-sex marriage is even possible is a relatively new one.\n\nUntil a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived, in\n\nany society in which marriage existed, that there could be marriages only between\n\nparticipants of different sex. . . . The right to marry is unquestionably a fundamental\n\nright. The right to marry someone of the same sex, however, is not ‘deeply rooted’; it has\n\nnot even been asserted until relatively recent times.” Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1,\n\n8-9 (N.Y. 2006) (citations omitted). 5\n\n\n5\n  In Baker, 191 N.W.2d 185, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that a state statute, interpreted\nby the Court as not authorizing same-sex marriages, did not violate due process or equal\nprotection. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the subsequent appeal for “want of [a] substantial\nfederal question.” 409 U.S. at 810. The U.S. Supreme Court’s action in Baker has been\ndescribed as binding precedent. Andersen v. King Co., 138 P.3d 963, 999 (Wash. 2006) (citing\nto Baker and holding “the same-sex union as a constitutional right argument was so frivolous as\nto merit dismissal without further argument by the Supreme Court. A similar result is required\ntoday.”); Morrison v. Sadler, 821 N.E.2d 15, 19 (Ind. App. 2005) (citing to Baker and stating:\n“There is binding United States Supreme Court precedent indicating that state bans on same-sex\n                                              16\n\f¶30    Given this exclusive importance of marriage, the law developed to give it sanction,\n\npermanence, and a formal structure upon which to base legal entitlement and obligation.\n\nAlthough commonly referred to as a contractual relationship, the obligation of marriage\n\nis more than merely contractual.       As the Supreme Court has explained, “when the\n\ncontract to marry is executed by the marriage, a relation between the parties is created\n\nwhich they cannot change. Other contracts may be modified, restricted, or enlarged, or\n\nentirely released upon the consent of the parties. Not so with marriage. The relation\n\nonce formed, the law steps in and holds the parties to various obligations and liabilities.”\n\nMaynard, 125 U.S. at 210-11, 8 S. Ct. at 729. “When the contracting parties have\n\nentered into the married state, they have not so much entered into a contract as into a new\n\nrelation, the rights, duties and obligations of which rest, not upon their agreement, but\n\nupon the general law of the State, statutory or common, which defines and prescribes\n\nthose rights, duties and obligations. They are of law, not of contract.” Adams, 51 Me. at\n\n483. As we have noted, “it is to the interest of the state that [marriage] be permanent.”\n\nFranklin, 40 Mont. at 350, 106 P. at 354.\n\n¶31    Upon this structure of permanence, and again in view of the exclusive importance\n\nof marriage, the state has built a system of exclusive benefits and protections on behalf\n\nof, and dependent upon, marriage. “[M]arital status often is a pre-condition to the receipt\n\nof government benefits (e.g., Social Security benefits), property rights (e.g., tenancy by\n\n\n\nmarriage do not violate the United States Constitution.”); Wilson v. Ake, 354 F. Supp. 2d 1298,\n1305 (M.D. Fla. 2005) (“Baker v. Nelson is binding precedent upon this Court”); but see In re\nKandu, 315 B.R. 123, 138 (W.D.Wash. 2004); In re J.B., 326 S.W.3d 654, 672 (Tex. App.\nDallas 2010).\n                                              17\n\fthe entirety, inheritance rights), and other, less tangible benefits (e.g., legitimation of\n\nchildren born out of wedlock).” Turner, 482 U.S. at 96, 107 S. Ct. at 2265. “In terms of\n\nfederal benefits, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) compiled in 1997, and\n\nupdated in 2004, a list of federal rights, responsibilities, and privileges granted to married\n\ncouples, but denied to same-sex couples. According to the study, there were 1,138\n\nfederal statutes providing such benefits.” Conaway, 932 A.2d at 582 n. 6 (citations\n\nomitted). Plaintiffs provided the District Court with a list of over 340 Montana statutes\n\nthat classify based on marital status and that would be impacted by the proposed relief\n\nsought.\n\n¶32    While Plaintiffs do not claim the right to marry, they are nonetheless claiming\n\nconstitutional entitlement to all of these same rights and benefits which are provided to\n\nmarried couples on the ground that they are “similarly situated in every material respect.”\n\nHowever, this position ignores the historical and long-developed legal foundation and\n\nformal structure giving marriage an exclusive legal permanence, which does not exist for\n\nother relationships. More importantly, the above discussion, including the precedent\n\naddressing marriage and its unique attributes, demonstrates that Plaintiffs’ claim to be\n\n“similarly situated” to married couples is without merit. This is not meant to disparage\n\nPlaintiffs or minimize the contributions they offer, but is simply a statement of the reality\n\nthat marriage between a woman and man exclusively provides unique and transcendent\n\nsocietal protections vital to human survival which differentiate it and make it dissimilar\n\nfrom other relationships.    These protections uniquely provided by marriage form a\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\flegitimate and even compelling state interest, and thus a constitutional basis, for the\n\nState’s exclusive treatment of marriage.\n\n¶33    The above discussion of the law of marriage reflects the general state of the law\n\nbefore the Marriage Amendment was adopted by Montanans in 2004. Although some of\n\nthe cited cases were decided after adoption of the Marriage Amendment, they were\n\npremised upon pre-2004 precedent, and marriage was considered to be a fundamental\n\nright with constitutionally protected status at the time of the Amendment’s adoption.\n\nHowever, several years earlier, legal arguments attacking the exclusive status of marriage\n\nbegan to be offered, and considerable concern was generated over whether the law’s\n\nexclusive treatment of marriage would remain, or whether courts would begin to overturn\n\nlong-standing precedent favoring marriage. With all due respect, several courts indicated\n\na willingness to uproot established legal precedent recognizing the uniqueness of\n\nmarriage between a man and woman, and eliminate the law’s exclusive treatment of\n\nmarriage. See e.g. Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993); Baker v. State, 744 A.2d\n\n864 (Vt. 2000); Goodridge v. Dept. of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003).\n\n¶34    The response of the citizens of the country to these court decisions can only be\n\ndescribed as a phenomenon of direct democracy. To counter this threat to established\n\nprecedent favoring marriage, citizens of some 31 states acted to either reinstate the law’s\n\nexclusive definition and treatment of marriage in some manner, or to ensure that courts\n\ncould not eliminate such exclusive treatment, by amending their state constitutions to\n\nexplicitly protect marriage. Montana was one of those states.\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f¶35    Building on the foundation of historical legal protections for marriage, Montana\n\nvoters solidified the premise that marriage is between one man and one woman by\n\nplacing the concept expressly into the Montana Constitution. Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7.\n\nThe Voter Information Packet provided voters with the arguments for and against\n\nadoption of the Amendment.        Proponents stated that the “[t]he time-honored, vital\n\ninstitution of marriage is being threatened. . . . Special interest groups are constantly\n\nseeking to gain special rights that infringe on the rights of the rest of society. Such\n\nspecial rights cost all Montanans. . . . Voting yes on CI-96 allows the people to give clear\n\ndirection to judges on this important issue.”\n\n¶36    Directly related to this case, proponents discussed the issue of benefits which are\n\nattendant to marriage. “If CI-96 fails, how will homosexual marriage one day affect your\n\nfamily? . . . Small business employers in Montana may someday be required to provide\n\nexpanded health coverage, retirement and fringe benefits to same-sex ‘spouses’ of\n\nemployees. The broad subjectivity of such un-funded mandates could hurt Montana’s\n\neconomy and jobs.”      Opponents likewise also focused on benefits and obligations\n\nassociated with same-sex couples: “if CI-96 were to pass, the State could nullify the\n\ncontractual agreements made between same-gender partners.              CI-96 would limit\n\ninnovative and robust companies from treating their employees equitably.”           As the\n\nDistrict Court noted, both sides of the debate acknowledged “that the marriage\n\namendment would have something to do with the benefits and obligations that relate to\n\nthe status of being married.”\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f¶37    Proponents and opponents alike focused on the issue of benefits because everyone\n\nunderstood the law:     that marriage is a concrete legal status upon which the State\n\npremises exclusive treatment and benefits, as demonstrated by the above-cited authority.\n\nIt is more than a label, a societal choice, a union of two people, or an aspiration. Indeed,\n\nmarriage is an obligation given exclusive protections in the law because it provides\n\nexclusive protections to society. Even before adoption of the Marriage Amendment, this\n\nwas recognized in Montana statute. See e.g. §§ 40-1-101, 40-1-103, 40-1-401, 40-2-101,\n\n40-2-102, MCA.      Montana has long used marital status as an exclusive basis for\n\nprovision and allotment of benefits and obligations. See e.g. §§ 2-18-601, 19-17-405, 33-\n\n22-140, 39-51-2205, 39-71-723, 50-9-106, 72-2-112, 15-30-2114, 15-30-2366, MCA.\n\nBuilding on these statutory provisions and the prior holdings of our cases, Montana\n\ncitizens enacted the Marriage Amendment to expressly “constitutionalize” these\n\nprinciples, thereby strengthening the law’s exclusive treatment of marriage. See State v.\n\nToomey, 135 Mont. 35, 51-53, 335 P.2d 1051, 1059-60 (1958) (“[W]e must construe the\n\namendment in the light of the conditions as they existed at the time of its adoption.\n\nRankin v. Love, 125 Mont. 184, 187, 232 P.2d 998, 1000 (1951); State ex rel. Bottomly v.\n\nDistrict Court, 73 Mont. 541, 547, 237 P. 525, 527 (1925). . . . “It is only reasonable to\n\nassume that the people, in adopting the amendment to our Constitution, adopted it in light\n\nof the existing [state law] and the construction placed upon that law by this Court.”).\n\n¶38    When asked during oral argument what unique legal concreteness would remain to\n\nmarriage if the requested relief was granted, Plaintiffs’ counsel replied, “How people\n\nview it, how symbolic and how important and how solemn it is, is important. Marriage is\n\n                                             21\n\fmeaningful.”    When asked again, “In what way?            I’m trying to understand what\n\nconcrete[ness] in the law is left?” Counsel responded, “The significance is that you’re\n\nmarried.” However, such a diminished concept of marriage would necessitate a dramatic\n\nrewriting of the law. Marriage has always been much more—a concrete legal status\n\nwhich the law recognized and favored with exclusive treatment, including benefits and\n\nobligations.   In adopting the Marriage Amendment, Montana voters determined to\n\npermanently preserve this exclusive treatment for marriage by placing it in the\n\nConstitution. Thus, in one way, Plaintiffs are asking this Court to render the Marriage\n\nAmendment superfluous by holding that it added nothing to the law’s previous exclusive\n\nclassification of marriage. 6   But further, Plaintiffs are asking the Court to hold the\n\nMarriage Amendment actually had a reverse effect—that marriage has less legal\n\nprotection now than before the Amendment was passed, because marriage can no longer\n\nserve as the basis for exclusive treatment by the State. Clearly, this is directly contrary to\n\nthe “clear direction to judges” which the Marriage Amendment was designed to give.\n\n¶39    “The Equal Protection Clause ‘is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom,\n\nfairness, or logic of [the voters’] choices.’” Citizens for Equal Protec., 455 F.3d at 867\n\n(bracket in original) (quoting F.C.C. v. Beach Commun., Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313, 113 S.\n\nCt. 2096, 2101 (1993)).         Now that the marriage relationship has been given\n\nconstitutionally-protected status, any change to the long-standing principles which govern\n\nthis issue must come from the people through the democratic process, not from the\n\n\n6\n  In addition to the above-cited legal rulings, marriage was limited to a man and woman under\nprior statutory law. See §§ 40-1-401(1)(d), 40-1-103, MCA.\n                                             22\n\fcourts. 7   “The package of government benefits and restrictions that accompany the\n\ninstitution of formal marriage serve a variety of other purposes. The legislature—or the\n\npeople through the initiative process—may rationally choose not to expand in wholesale\n\nfashion the groups entitled to those benefits.” Citizens for Equal Protec., 455 F.3d at 868\n\n(emphasis added). “[A]s we have explained, there is no fundamental right to be free of\n\nthe political barrier a validly enacted constitutional amendment erects.” Citizens for\n\nEqual Protec., 455 F.3d at 868.\n\n¶40     I appreciate the deeply-held feelings and beliefs of the Plaintiffs and condemn any\n\nacts of cruelty they have suffered, some of which are referenced in their affidavits. Yet,\n\ngiven the long-standing legal protections and exclusive treatment of marriage, with its\n\ncorresponding benefits and obligations, and the incorporation of those principles into the\n\nMontana Constitution by the citizens of Montana, Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim must\n\nfail.\n\n¶41     I concur.\n\n                                                  /S/ JIM RICE\n\n\n\nJustice Patricia O.

INTRODUCTION\n\n¶45           [I]f we have learned anything from the significant evolution\n              in the prevailing societal views and official policies toward\n              members of minority races and toward women over the past\n              half-century, it is that even the most familiar and generally\n              accepted of social practices and traditions often mask an\n              unfairness and inequality that frequently is not recognized or\n\n                                              24\n\f                appreciated by those not directly harmed by those practices\n                or traditions. 1\n\n¶46    There are some cases where we look back and can see that the court was clearly on\n\nthe wrong side of history. Among the most notorious are Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S.\n\n393 (1857) (slaves of African descent are property, not citizens); Plessy v. Ferguson, 163\n\nU.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138 (1896) (segregation of white and colored people in public\n\nfacilities does not violate equal protection, provided the facilities are “equal”); Muller v.\n\nOregon, 208 U.S. 412, 421-23, 28 S. Ct. 324, 326-27 (1908) (differential treatment of\n\nwomen in employment is justified because “woman has always been dependent upon\n\nman”); Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200, 47 S. Ct. 584 (1927) (compulsory sterilization of\n\nfeebleminded individuals “in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence”\n\ndoes not violate due process or equal protection; “[t]hree generations of imbeciles are\n\nenough”); People v. Hall, 4 Cal. 399, 404-05 (Cal. 1854) (the Chinese, being “a race of\n\npeople whom nature has marked as inferior” and who are “incapable of progress or\n\nintellectual development beyond a certain point,” may be precluded from testifying\n\nagainst white persons); and Scott v. State, 39 Ga. 321, 323 (1869) (racial intermarriage is\n\n“unnatural” and “productive of deplorable results”; “the offspring of these unnatural\n\nconnections are generally sickly and effeminate”). I venture to say that another case\n\nbelonging on this list is Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 106 S. Ct. 2841 (1986) (the\n\nstate may regulate private sexual conduct between consenting adults), which the Supreme\n\nCourt overruled in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S. Ct. 2472 (2003) (individual\n\n\n       1\n           In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 451 (Cal. 2008).\n                                             25\n\fdecisions by two adults—married or unmarried—concerning the intimacies of their\n\nphysical relationship are a form of “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\nAs Justice Kennedy aptly stated in his opinion for the Court in Lawrence, “times can\n\nblind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary\n\nand proper in fact serve only to oppress.” 539 U.S. at 579, 123 S. Ct. at 2484.\n\n¶47    In the wake of the Hawaii Supreme Court’s decision in Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d\n\n44 (Haw. 1993), which held that denying same-sex couples the ability to marry must be\n\njustified under “strict scrutiny” principles, measures were proposed and adopted in as\n\nmany as 30 states, including Montana, purporting to limit marriage to one man and one\n\nwoman. Due to the success of these measures, it became “a constant theme of opponents\n\nof same-sex marriage that whenever it has been put before the voters it has lost.” Erik\n\nEckholm, In Maine and Maryland, Victories at the Ballot Box for Same-Sex Marriage,\n\nN.Y. Times (Nov. 7, 2012). That, however, is no longer true. In this most recent election\n\nof November 6, 2012, voters in Maine, Maryland, and Washington approved ballot\n\nmeasures authorizing same-sex couples to marry. And in Minnesota, voters defeated a\n\nballot measure that would have amended the Minnesota Constitution to limit marriage to\n\none man and one woman. It appears that a majority of voters in these states have seen\n\nthrough the scare tactics and propaganda which “family values” organizations and certain\n\nreligious groups have used to persuade the electorate that allowing same-sex marriage\n\nwill harm children, hurt businesses and the economy, intrude on religious freedoms, and\n\nundermine the institution of marriage itself. As discussed in greater detail later in this\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fDissent, there is no actual evidence supporting any of the maledictions and stereotypes\n\nused in the campaigns against same-sex marriage.\n\n¶48    Meanwhile, in Montana, the issue at hand is not about same-sex marriage. It is\n\nless dramatic, though by no means less important. It concerns the right of committed\n\nintimate same-sex couples to receive the same civil protections which the State makes\n\navailable to committed intimate different-sex couples. Plaintiffs assert, and rightly so,\n\nthat their government may not single out unpopular groups for disfavored treatment, as\n\nthe State of Montana has done here. Shockingly, this Court refuses to uphold this most\n\nbasic principle of constitutional law. While I have not always agreed with this Court’s\n\ndecisions—in fact, I have strenuously disagreed with my colleagues on occasion 2—I\n\nhave never disagreed more strongly with the Court as I do in this case. With due respect,\n\nI believe today’s decision, like those mentioned above, wrongly deprives an abused\n\nminority of their civil rights.\n\n¶49    This Dissent is lengthy. It is meant to be, for several reasons. First, I believe this\n\nis the most important civil rights case to come before this Court in decades. And it will\n\n       2\n        See e.g. Western Tradition Partn. v. Atty. Gen., 2011 MT 328, ¶¶ 61-135, 363\nMont. 220, 271 P.3d 1 (dissent); Musselshell Ranch Co. v.

The issues here are significant\n\nand complex, and deserving of thorough consideration, analysis, and discussion.\n\n¶50    Second, I am profoundly disappointed in this Court, as an institution, for rendering\n\na decision that requires Plaintiffs, the same-sex couples here, to wage a litigation jihad\n\nagainst their own government to obtain the statutory rights, benefits, and protections to\n\nwhich they are constitutionally entitled.       I have located no court decision in this\n\ncountry—state or federal—applying the declaratory judgment laws in the cabined and\n\nunworkable fashion that this Court does here.\n\n¶51    Lastly, I am thoroughly disheartened that today’s decision takes civil rights in this\n\nState backward to a time when court decisions supported and facilitated other equally\n\npernicious forms of government-sanctioned discrimination, including slavery and racial\n\nsegregation; women being viewed as little more than men’s dependents, unable to vote or\n\nown property; the Chinese being deemed an “inferior” race; the compulsory sterilization\n\nof the “feebleminded”; and the criminalization of private sexual intimacy between two\n\nconsenting adults. No other minority group has been treated in this fashion in this State\n\nin modern times. This, truly, is a shameful, black day for civil rights in Montana.\n\n¶52    Yet, while gay, lesbian, and bisexual citizens may have lost this battle, the war is\n\nnot over. If we have learned anything as an evolving species, it is that no government, no\n\nreligion, no institution, and no political party can long oppress the inviolable dignity and\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\fspirit of human beings in their fight for fairness in the courts, access to justice, and equal\n\nprotection of the laws.\n\n¶53    With these introductory remarks, I now proceed to my detailed discussion and\n\nanalysis. In Part II (¶¶ 57-80), I provide a background and overview of the case and the\n\nissues. In Part III (¶¶ 81-113), I explain the declaratory judgment laws and address in\n\ndetail the District Court’s and this Court’s erroneous analyses under those laws.\n\n¶54    Next, in Part IV (¶¶ 114-168), I analyze Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim. Given the\n\nevidence that gay, lesbian, and bisexual people are reviled and demonized in Montana\n\nand have suffered a history of invidious and prejudicial treatment, I conclude that sexual\n\norientation is a suspect class under Montana’s Equal Protection Clause, and thus that\n\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation in the provision of statutory benefits,\n\nprotections, and services must survive “strict scrutiny” review. I further conclude that\n\ntreating Plaintiffs differently based on sexual orientation is an affront to and violation of\n\ntheir inviolable right to human dignity, also protected by Montana’s Constitution.\n\n¶55    As a final matter, in Part V (¶¶ 169-206), I am compelled to address the so-called\n\nMarriage Amendment to Montana’s Constitution (Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7). Plaintiffs\n\ndo not ask to be “married,” and granting them the relief they seek does not offend that\n\nprovision in the slightest. Yet, the State relies on the Marriage Amendment as support\n\nfor its position, and the State’s argument before this Court is bolstered by an outpouring\n\nof attacks on the same-sex couples by no less than 128 Montana protestant churches and\n\nthe Montana Catholic Bishops, all appearing through the Montana Catholic Conference\n\nas amicus curiae, along with other “family values” organizations, also appearing as amici\n\n                                             29\n\fcuriae. The Marriage Amendment is the conduit through which the State and its amici\n\nclaim that it may deprive Plaintiffs—who, because of this provision, cannot marry—of\n\nthe statutory benefits and protections which the State grants to married couples. That the\n\nState and its amici have injected the Marriage Amendment into this case at all, however,\n\ndemonstrates, in spades, what that provision is really about: the constitutionalization of\n\nreligious doctrine. Indeed, what the State and its amici seek to do here is conflate\n\nsectarian canons regarding marriage with secular laws governing the provision of\n\nbenefits and protections to committed couples.      In my view, this approach violates\n\nseveral constitutional provisions, not the least of which is the clause in Montana’s\n\nDeclaration of Rights prohibiting the State from establishing religion. Emblematic of the\n\nreligiously grounded discrimination defended by the State and its amici is the blatant\n\nmendacity underlying the Marriage Amendment initiative—a fourberie reminiscent of\n\nsome of the worst propaganda campaigns perpetrated in modern times.\n\n¶56   In the last section of this Dissent, Part VI (¶¶ 207-212), I set forth my conclusions\n\nand provide a short epilogue.\n\n                       II. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW\n\n¶57   Plaintiffs here are twelve lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals who are in six\n\ncommitted, intimate, same-sex relationships. As of the filing of their affidavits in the\n\nDistrict Court on December 10, 2010, plaintiffs Donaldson and Guggenheim had been in\n\na relationship for 27 years; Leslie and Haugland for 12 years; Stallings and Wagner for\n\n21 years; Gibson and Boettcher for 11 years; Long and Parker for 8 years; and Owens\n\nand Williams for 18 years. With their life partners, Plaintiffs have established families\n\n                                           30\n\fwhich provide them with long-term mutual emotional and economic support and a stable\n\nenvironment for raising children. Plaintiffs are employed in, or have retired from, a\n\nvariety of professions including teaching, coaching, counseling, engineering, music, art,\n\nand medicine. They are active in their children’s schools, in their churches, in their\n\nprofessions, and in their communities. One has served in the Montana Legislature. It is\n\nundisputed that Plaintiffs are productive members of society and have, in fact,\n\nsuccessfully raised a number of children. Some Plaintiffs are now grandparents.\n\n¶58    Plaintiffs desire to protect their family relationships in the same way their\n\nheterosexual neighbors, coworkers, and fellow community members are able to do under\n\nMontana law. Plaintiffs have taken some steps in this regard. For example, they have\n\nentered into joint tenancy arrangements on their houses and bank accounts and have\n\nexecuted powers of attorney, healthcare directives, and wills in favor of their partners.\n\nPlaintiffs point out, however, that such private legal arrangements can be expensive and,\n\nthus, are not available to many couples. Plaintiffs also express concerns about whether\n\nthese arrangements will be honored—especially in the event of a medical emergency.\n\nSome Plaintiffs describe (in their affidavits) past incidents when healthcare personnel\n\nrefused to speak with them about their partner’s condition. Another Plaintiff (Leslie)\n\ndescribes how she and her former partner, Erika, took many of the legally available steps\n\nto protect their relationship. Yet, after Erika died in a work-related accident on Christmas\n\nDay 1996, which was their eighth anniversary, Leslie found herself “powerless and\n\ndegraded” and treated like a “legal stranger” when she attempted to exercise the\n\nresponsibilities of a partner. She was denied access to Erika’s remains; she was denied a\n\n                                            31\n\fcopy of the death certificate by the sheriff because she was a “stranger in blood”; she was\n\nrefused paid bereavement leave by her employer (the same employer for whom Erika had\n\nbeen working when she was killed) and thus had to go back to work only a week after\n\nErika’s death; she had no rights under the intestacy laws with regard to Erika’s property;\n\nshe had no legal means to prevent Erika’s family from entering their home, going through\n\ntheir belongings, and taking Erika’s possessions, many of which the two had shared as\n\ndomestic partners; and, to add insult to injury, she was required to pay inheritance taxes\n\non the proceeds from Erika’s half of their condominium, which Leslie was forced to sell.\n\n¶59    The underlying issue, as the District Court stated in its Order, is that “individuals\n\nsuch as Plaintiffs are denied a variety of benefits and protections that are statutorily\n\navailable to heterosexual spouses.” The District Court identified some of these statutes\n\nand noted some of the “real life scenarios” in which these laws have affected Plaintiffs.\n\nFor example, Montana’s intestacy laws and workers’ compensation laws provide certain\n\nprotections to the surviving spouse of a different-sex relationship, but not to the surviving\n\npartner of a same-sex relationship. Likewise, bereavement leave is made available to a\n\ndifferent-sex spouse but not to a same-sex partner. Furthermore, Plaintiffs are unable\n\nunder Montana’s tax laws to file joint returns or to take the spousal exemption for\n\nnonworking spouses if filing separately. Montana law permits the different-sex spouse of\n\na terminally ill person to withhold life-sustaining treatment, but does not afford this right\n\nto the same-sex partner of a terminally ill person. Similarly, the different-sex spouse of a\n\nperson who has become mentally incompetent has priority to become guardian, but a\n\nsame-sex partner does not have this same right.\n\n                                             32\n\f¶60    If not for the fact that each couple consists of two members of the same sex,\n\nPlaintiffs’ relationships could qualify as “marriage” under Montana law.            Title 40,\n\nchapter 1, MCA. As noted, however, Plaintiffs do not ask to be granted the status of\n\n“married.” For purposes of this case, Plaintiffs only seek a determination that they are\n\nentitled, as a matter of constitutional law, to obtain the same rights and benefits—along\n\nwith the same mutual responsibilities and obligations—which the State of Montana has\n\nchosen to grant to different-sex married couples. The premise underlying this claim is\n\nthat “marriage” does not include an exclusive right to any particular rights and benefits\n\nconferred by the government, and that “marriage” connotes something other than just the\n\nreceipt of such rights and benefits. See e.g. In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 426-27,\n\n434-35, 444-46 (Cal. 2008) (“the constitutional right to marry clearly does not obligate\n\nthe state to afford specific tax or other governmental benefits on the basis of a couple’s\n\nfamily relationship”; even if all of the personal and dignity interests which have\n\ntraditionally informed the right to marry have been given to same-sex couples through the\n\nDomestic Partner Act, there is still “a considerable and undeniable symbolic importance”\n\nto the designation of “marriage”); Kerrigan v. Commr. of Pub. Health, 957 A.2d 407,\n\n417-18 (Conn. 2008) (“[m]arriage . . . is not merely shorthand for a discrete set of legal\n\nrights and responsibilities”; “[a]lthough marriage and civil unions do embody the same\n\nlegal rights under our law, they are by no means ‘equal’[;] . . . the former is an institution\n\nof transcendent historical, cultural and social significance, whereas the latter most surely\n\nis not”); Perry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052, 1077-79 (9th Cir. 2012) (discussing “the\n\nextraordinary significance of the official designation of ‘marriage’ ” apart from the rights,\n\n                                             33\n\fprotections, and benefits conferred by the government). Therefore, Plaintiffs argue, when\n\nthe State chooses to make benefits and protections available to persons in committed\n\nintimate relationships, the State must do so evenhandedly, without discriminating on the\n\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the persons in those relationships. In a sense, Plaintiffs\n\nare merely demanding “separate but equal” treatment by the State—the minimal floor of\n\nequal protection rights under Plessy.\n\n¶61    The Attorney General does not deny that the State could provide such protections\n\nto committed intimate same-sex couples. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General\n\nacknowledges in his appellate brief that “the Legislature could choose to provide benefits\n\nsimilar to spousal benefits to unmarried couples” and that “the Legislature could create a\n\ndifferent status conferring similar benefits outside of marriage for civil unions or\n\ndomestic partners.”    The Attorney General, speaking through an Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, made similar statements during oral argument.\n\n¶62    One may wonder, then, why we do not simply grant Plaintiffs the declaratory\n\nrelief they seek. While I certainly do not condone the “separate but equal” doctrine of\n\nPlessy—which the Supreme Court overruled in Brown v. Board of Ed., 347 U.S. 483, 74\n\nS. Ct. 686 (1954)—Plaintiffs have made clear that, for purposes of this lawsuit, they do\n\nnot seek the status of marriage. They merely seek “equal opportunity” to obtain the same\n\nbenefits and protections which the State, in its discretion, has chosen to make available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples. It is surely beyond cavil that Plaintiffs are entitled, at the very\n\nleast, to the equal protection of these laws—even if that protection is effected through a\n\nregime that does not include marriage, as the Attorney General suggests. See Alaska Civ.\n\n                                             34\n\fLiberties Union v. State, 122 P.3d 781, 793-94 (Alaska 2005) (restricting public benefits\n\nprograms to different-sex married couples violates the rights of employees with same-sex\n\npartners to “equal rights, opportunities, and protection under the law”); Lewis v. Harris,\n\n908 A.2d 196, 220-21 (N.J. 2006) (as a matter of equal protection, “committed same-sex\n\ncouples must be afforded on equal terms the same rights and benefits enjoyed by married\n\nopposite-sex couples”); Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 886 (Vt. 1999) (the State has “a\n\nconstitutional obligation to extend to [same-sex couples] the common benefit, protection,\n\nand security that Vermont law provides opposite-sex married couples”).\n\n¶63   It appears from the District Court record, the arguments on appeal, and the Court’s\n\nOpinion that the hindrance in recognizing and declaring these rights boils down to a\n\nsimple refusal by those in power to make the constitutionally sound—albeit politically\n\nunpopular—decision. For starters, rather than concede the elementary premise of this\n\nlawsuit—that it is a denial of equal protection to make statutory protections available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples, who may obtain them by getting married, but to categorically deny\n\nthem to same-sex couples, who are not able to get married—the Attorney General instead\n\nattempts to justify and prolong this institutionalized discrimination being perpetrated by\n\nthe State of Montana against a discrete minority of its citizens. 3 Frankly, the State’s\n\n\n\n      3\n         In contrast, see e.g. Perry v. Brown, 265 P.3d 1002, 1008 (Cal. 2011): “The\nanswer filed by the [California] Attorney General also declined to defend the initiative,\nbut went further and affirmatively took the position that Proposition 8 [which amended\nthe California Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage] is unconstitutional.” See also\ne.g. Ltr. from Eric H. Holder Jr., U.S. Atty. Gen., to John A. Boehner, Speaker, U.S.\nH.R., at 2 (Feb. 23, 2011) (Dkt. 42 in the District Court record): “[T]he President [of the\nUnited States] and I have concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation\n                                            35\n\farguments in this regard are inconsistent and difficult to follow. On one hand, the State\n\nconcedes that the Legislature could provide committed intimate same-sex couples with\n\nsimilar benefits as are afforded to different-sex married couples. Yet, on the other hand,\n\nthe State suggests that any benefits provided to different-sex married couples cannot also\n\nbe provided to same-sex couples due to the Marriage Amendment. This reasoning is\n\nclearly a non sequitur for reasons discussed in greater detail in the Marriage Amendment\n\nsection below. See ¶¶ 174-179, infra. For the time being, it suffices to point out that the\n\nMarriage Amendment merely states: “Only a marriage between one man and one woman\n\nshall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.” And, as noted, Plaintiffs are not\n\nasking that their relationships be recognized as “marriage.” Furthermore, the Marriage\n\nAmendment does not require the State to grant married couples tax benefits, or the right\n\nto make medical decisions for a spouse, or the right to death benefits under the workers’\n\ncompensation laws, etc. Nor does it say that these sorts of benefits and protections, if the\n\nState chooses to grant them, may not also be offered to unmarried persons. The State\n\nconcedes that the Legislature could enact a civil-union or domestic-partnership scheme.\n\n¶64    Perhaps for these reasons, the State ultimately takes the position that Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional claim should not be decided at all. The reason: a ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor\n\ncould result in the invalidation of “innumerable” unspecified statutes. Yet, surely the fact\n\nthat Plaintiffs are being discriminated against in “innumerable” ways is reason to hasten a\n\ndecision on the merits of their claim, not delay it. Regrettably, however, a majority of\n\n\nwarrant heightened scrutiny and that, as applied to same-sex couples legally married\nunder state law, Section 3 of [the Defense of Marriage Act] is unconstitutional.”\n                                            36\n\fthis Court defers to the Attorney General’s approach. Instead of requiring the State to\n\ndemonstrate the constitutionality of its practices, the Court punts. The Court implies that\n\nPlaintiffs are to blame—that their failure to “specifically identify” and “specifically\n\nanalyze” the “specific statutes” that are discriminatory somehow precludes us from\n\ndeclaring Plaintiffs’ rights. Opinion, ¶¶ 9, 11, 13. How the Court expects Plaintiffs to\n\npresent their claim is not entirely clear from the Court’s opaque analysis. But a careful\n\ninspection reveals the Court’s rationale to be entirely disingenuous in any event.\n\n¶65    First of all, Plaintiffs have identified numerous statutes which grant benefits and\n\nprotections to different-sex spouses but not to same-sex partners. Indeed, after observing\n\nin its Order that “Plaintiffs are denied a variety of benefits and protections that are\n\nstatutorily available to heterosexual spouses,” the District Court lists a slew of those\n\nstatutes. Furthermore, Plaintiffs attached a laundry list of the discriminatory statutes to\n\ntheir motion to alter or amend the judgment. That list is attached as Appendix 1 to this\n\nDissent. If what the Court needs is a specific statute to analyze, the Court can simply\n\npick one of the numerous statutes identified in the District Court’s Order or in Plaintiffs’\n\nlist, and assess its validity in light of the parties’ arguments. The constitutional principles\n\nof the Court’s analysis could then be extrapolated and applied to other statutes.\n\n¶66    Secondly, if the Court is suggesting that Plaintiffs may not obtain a declaratory\n\nruling until they have specifically identified every single discriminatory statute, it appears\n\nentirely likely that the extensive list of statutes attached to Plaintiffs’ motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment is, in fact, a listing of every single discriminatory statute. If that is\n\nwhat the Court needs, then the Court need look no further than Plaintiffs’ motion, which\n\n                                              37\n\fis contained in the District Court record. More importantly, however, the Court has cited\n\nno authority whatsoever for requiring Plaintiffs to identify all of the discriminatory\n\nstatutes. In fact, as I discuss in further detail below, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct enables Plaintiffs to obtain a declaration of their rights in a single lawsuit, without\n\nnecessarily identifying each and every discriminatory statute.\n\n¶67    Thirdly, if the Court is suggesting that Plaintiffs must challenge each statute on an\n\nindividual basis, the Court has cited no authority for this approach either. Indeed, one\n\npurpose of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is to avoid such seriatim litigation.\n\nAs Plaintiffs reminded the District Court in their motion to alter or amend the judgment,\n\nthey sought declaratory relief “in part to avoid this type of expensive and protracted\n\nlitigation that would drain judicial resources while prolonging the harm experienced by\n\nPlaintiffs and their families.” Cf. McGillivray v. State, 1999 MT 3, ¶¶ 9-11, 293 Mont.\n\n19, 972 P.2d 804 (concluding that declaratory relief was the only “reasonable remedy”\n\nwhere, absent such relief, only those plaintiffs who had “the financial resources and\n\npersonal fortitude to endure four different court proceedings” would be able to exercise\n\ntheir claimed constitutional right, while those plaintiffs “who will not or cannot afford\n\nthis extensive litigation would be denied their right”).     Indeed, forcing Plaintiffs to\n\nchallenge each of the “innumerable” statutes in piecemeal fashion is not only manifestly\n\nunfair to them, it is an enormous waste of resources, given that the underlying legal\n\nquestion is the same with respect to each statute at issue. Montana taxpayers, who will\n\nhave to foot the State’s legal bills for defending each of these “innumerable” lawsuits,\n\nshould be appalled by the Court’s and the Attorney General’s approach here.\n\n                                            38\n\f¶68    I think it is worth noting that the Court’s and the Attorney General’s approach is\n\ncompletely out of step with other courts around the country—federal and state. For\n\nexample, Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, defines\n\n“marriage” as a legal union between one man and one woman, and defines “spouse” as a\n\nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife. Although these definitions have\n\n“varying impact on more than a thousand federal laws,” the Second Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals did not require the plaintiff to specifically identify those laws. Windsor v.\n\nUnited States, 699 F.3d 169, 180 (2d Cir. 2012). To the contrary, the court proceeded to\n\nanalyze her equal protection claim and concluded that “homosexuals compose a class that\n\nis subject to heightened scrutiny,” that the class is “quasi-suspect” and thus subject to\n\n“intermediate scrutiny,” and that “DOMA’s classification of same-sex spouses was not\n\nsubstantially related to an important government interest.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 185,\n\n188. Similarly, despite DOMA’s “ramifying application throughout the U.S. Code” and\n\nits “effects on the numerous federal programs at issue,” the First Circuit Court of Appeals\n\ndid not require the plaintiffs to identify the “economic and other benefits” impacted by\n\nDOMA. Massachusetts v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F.3d 1, 5, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 2012).   The court simply analyzed the constitutionality of excluding same-sex\n\ncouples and concluded that “Congress’ denial of federal benefits to same-sex couples\n\nlawfully married in Massachusetts has not been adequately supported by any permissible\n\nfederal interest.” Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 16.\n\n¶69    In New Jersey, different-sex married couples are entitled to “a vast array of\n\neconomic and social benefits and privileges.” Lewis, 908 A.2d at 206. While same-sex\n\n                                            39\n\fcouples enjoyed various rights under New Jersey’s Domestic Partnership Act, they were\n\nstill denied “many benefits and privileges” accorded to married couples. Lewis, 908 A.2d\n\nat 215. In other words, the Domestic Partnership Act “failed to bridge the inequality gap\n\nbetween committed same-sex couples and married opposite-sex couples.” Lewis, 908\n\nA.2d at 215. The New Jersey Supreme Court noted a number of the rights afforded to\n\nmarried couples but denied to same-sex couples. The court did not require the plaintiffs,\n\nhowever, to go back to the trial court and re-file their constitutional challenge to this\n\nscheme—like this Court does in the present case—as “specific” challenges to “specific”\n\nstatutes. Rather, the court quite sensibly and logically explained that the constitutional\n\nquestion is “whether there is a public need to deny committed same-sex partners the\n\nbenefits and privileges available to heterosexual couples.” Lewis, 908 A.2d at 217.\n\nUltimately, the court held that “denying to committed same-sex couples the financial and\n\nsocial benefits and privileges given to their married heterosexual counterparts bears no\n\nsubstantial relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.” Lewis, 908 A.2d at 220.\n\n¶70   The fact that there were “hundreds” of statutes relating to marriage and to marital\n\nbenefits did not prevent the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts from ascertaining\n\nwhether the exclusion of same-sex couples from those benefits violated the state\n\nconstitution. Goodridge v. Dept. of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 955 (Mass. 2003). The\n\ncourt noted some of the statutory benefits in its opinion, but saw no need “to be\n\ncomprehensive.” Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 955. The Hawaii Supreme Court also saw\n\nno such need. In considering the same-sex couples’ constitutional challenge, the court\n\nobserved that “a multiplicity of rights and benefits” are contingent upon the status of\n\n                                           40\n\fmarriage, but the court found it “unnecessary . . . to engage in an encyclopedic recitation\n\nof all of them.” Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, 59 (Haw. 1993).\n\n¶71    The Vermont Supreme Court likewise had no difficulty analyzing the legality of\n\nexcluding same-sex couples from the “broad array of legal benefits and protections\n\nincident to the marital relation, including access to a spouse’s medical, life, and disability\n\ninsurance, hospital visitation and other medical decisionmaking privileges, spousal\n\nsupport, intestate succession, homestead protections, and many other statutory\n\nprotections.”   Baker, 744 A.2d at 870.       The court did not require the plaintiffs to\n\nspecifically identify and specifically analyze the specific statutes. Rather, the court\n\naddressed the question common to each: “whether the exclusion of same-sex couples\n\nfrom the benefits and protections incident to marriage under Vermont law” is\n\nunconstitutional. Baker, 744 A.2d at 880. The court ultimately found “a constitutional\n\nobligation to extend to plaintiffs the common benefit, protection, and security that\n\nVermont law provides opposite-sex married couples.” Baker, 744 A.2d at 886.\n\n¶72    I could continue, but I think the point is clear. In refusing to issue a declaratory\n\nruling as to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and in forcing them to instead litigate each\n\nstatutory protection individually, this Court sets itself up as the only court in the country\n\nto follow such an approach. In so doing, the Court commits grievous error.\n\n¶73    The instant case is no different than the cases cited above. “Marriage” in Montana\n\nis presently defined as “a personal relationship between a man and a woman arising out\n\nof a civil contract.” Section 40-1-103, MCA. Marriage between two persons of the same\n\nsex is prohibited. Section 40-1-401(1)(d), MCA; Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7. Hence, by\n\n                                             41\n\fdefinition, a person cannot be the “spouse” of someone who is the same sex. Black’s\n\nLaw Dictionary 1533 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009) (spouse: “a\n\nmarried person”). The State grants a broad array of legal benefits and protections to\n\n“spouses.” As but one example, § 37-19-904(2)(c), MCA, grants the surviving “spouse”\n\nthe right to control the disposition of the remains of a deceased person. Same-sex\n\ncouples are excluded from the operation of these statutes because, by definition, they\n\ncannot be “spouses” and because they are not encompassed within the scope of the\n\nstatutes in some other way. See e.g. § 45-5-206, MCA (for purposes of partner or family\n\nmember assault, “partners” means “spouses, former spouses, persons who have a child in\n\ncommon, and persons who have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate\n\nrelationship with a person of the opposite sex” (emphasis added)). Plaintiffs’ claim here\n\nis the same as the challengers’ claims in the above cases: excluding same-sex couples\n\nfrom the opportunity to obtain the protections of these laws is unconstitutional.\n\n¶74    As detailed in the Declaratory Judgment section below, there is simply no basis in\n\nlaw or in reason for requiring Plaintiffs to present their constitutional claim within the\n\ncontext of a challenge to a specific spousal benefit, or for requiring them to pursue\n\nindependent challenges to each benefit, or for requiring them to identify all of the\n\ndiscriminatory laws. The notion that they must “specifically identify” and “specifically\n\nanalyze” each of the “innumerable” statutes is, in reality, nothing more than a straw-man\n\nargument that the Attorney General has invented, and this Court has adopted, to avoid a\n\nsocially divisive issue. I cannot believe that if the statutes discriminated on the basis of\n\nrace, national origin, or religious affiliation, rather than sexual orientation, the Court\n\n                                            42\n\fwould concoct such an implausible procedural technicality as the Court does here to\n\nevade a legitimately presented constitutional question and deny the plaintiffs relief.\n\n¶75    For all of these reasons, the Court’s contention that it cannot issue a ruling on\n\nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights is devoid of any genuine or well-grounded underpinning.\n\nAnd so is the Court’s suggestion that Plaintiffs still need “to develop an argument as to\n\n. . . the level of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to [the discriminatory] laws\n\nby the courts.” Opinion, ¶ 13. Plaintiffs devote entire sections of their briefs to this exact\n\nquestion, arguing that sexual orientation is a suspect class and that the denial of statutory\n\nbenefits and obligations based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened\n\nscrutiny. It is not clear whether the Court has overlooked these sections of Plaintiffs’\n\nbriefs, or simply chosen to ignore them, but the argument is there. Perhaps the Court’s\n\nview is that the level of scrutiny varies from statute to statute depending on “the nature of\n\nthe State’s interest.” Opinion, ¶ 13. That, however, would be quite the novel approach to\n\nconstitutional law. Indeed, I am aware of no precedent, from any court in this country,\n\nholding that the level of scrutiny—rational basis, middle tier, or strict—is determined not\n\nby the classification or the constitutional right at issue, but by “the nature of the State’s\n\ninterest” in discriminating against the class or infringing the right. Such an approach\n\nturns equal protection and due process analysis on its head.\n\n¶76    If the reader is baffled by what the Court is requiring of Plaintiffs, he or she is not\n\nalone. As a purely factual matter, there is no dispute that the State, by statute, makes\n\ncertain benefits and obligations available to different-sex couples but denies same-sex\n\ncouples access to those same benefits and obligations. The legal question common to\n\n                                             43\n\fevery challenge Plaintiffs might lodge against these statutes is whether, under our\n\nConstitution, the State may categorically exclude homosexuals and bisexuals in\n\ncommitted intimate same-sex relationships from the opportunity to obtain the same\n\nstatutory protections made available to heterosexuals and bisexuals in committed intimate\n\ndifferent-sex relationships. There is no persuasive, let alone legitimate, reason why we\n\ncannot issue a ruling on this question. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that “the\n\nnature of the State’s interest” in excluding same-sex couples varies from statute to statute,\n\nthis does not preclude us from declaring what Plaintiffs’ rights are under traditional\n\nconstitutional principles. We can rule—and I would rule—that sexual orientation is a\n\nsuspect class and, therefore, that the State’s interest in denying same-sex couples the\n\nopportunity to obtain the statutory protections offered to different-sex couples must be\n\n“compelling.” Such a ruling is permitted by the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act,\n\nand it would adequately resolve this dispute. At that point, the legislative and executive\n\nbranches could take whatever steps are necessary to honor Plaintiffs’ civil rights—as\n\nlegislative and executive officers are constitutionally sworn to do (Mont. Const. art. III,\n\n§ 3)—in accordance with our decision.\n\n¶77    The Court tells Plaintiffs that they may amend their complaint and pursue further\n\nproceedings in the District Court. Opinion, ¶ 13. While this at least has the virtue of\n\nrescuing their claims from the District Court’s outright dismissal, I cannot agree that this\n\nremedy is adequate. To the contrary, refusing to declare Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights\n\nforthwith, and sending them back to the District Court for unnecessary re-litigation of a\n\nconstitutional question they have squarely presented to us in the instant appeal, is itself an\n\n                                             44\n\finfringement of those rights. It must not be forgotten that “[t]he rights here asserted are,\n\nlike all such rights, present rights; they are not merely hopes to some future enjoyment of\n\nsome formalistic constitutional promise. The basic guarantees of our Constitution are\n\nwarrants for the here and now and, unless there is an overwhelmingly compelling reason,\n\nthey are to be promptly fulfilled.” Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 533, 83\n\nS. Ct. 1314, 1318 (1963) (rejecting the City’s request for further delay in meeting its\n\nconstitutional obligation under the Fourteenth Amendment to desegregate its public parks\n\nand other municipal recreational facilities). Likewise, under Montana law, the courts of\n\nthis State (including the Montana Supreme Court) are courts of justice. Section 3-1-101,\n\nMCA. “Courts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for\n\nevery injury of person[.] . . . Right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial,\n\nor delay.” Mont. Const. art. II, § 16. This fundamental constitutional right is not simply\n\naccess to courts. It is access to justice—defined in Montana’s organic law to mean a\n\nspeedy remedy, to every person, for every injury of person, without delay.\n\n¶78    Thus, as a matter of federal constitutional law and Montana constitutional law,\n\nPlaintiffs are entitled to a prompt determination of their constitutional rights vis-à-vis the\n\nState of Montana’s admitted practice of making benefits and protections available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples while categorically denying them to same-sex couples. Plaintiffs\n\nare also entitled to prompt rectification for any violations of these rights. Watson, 373\n\nU.S. at 533, 83 S. Ct. at 1318 (“any deprivation of constitutional rights calls for prompt\n\nrectification”); Mont. Const. art. II, § 16 (“speedy remedy” shall be afforded for every\n\ninjury). “It is axiomatic that ‘justice delayed is justice denied.’ ” State ex rel. Carlin v.\n\n                                             45\n\fFifth Jud. Dist. Ct., 118 Mont. 127, 135, 164 P.2d 155, 159 (1945); cf. Christianson v.\n\nColt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816, 108 S. Ct. 2166, 2178 (1988)\n\n(“Perpetual litigation of any issue . . . delays, and therefore threatens to deny, justice.”);\n\nKloss v. Edward D. Jones & Co., 2002 MT 129, ¶ 58, 310 Mont. 123, 54 P.3d 1 (Nelson,\n\nTrieweiler, Leaphart, & Cotter, JJ., specially concurring) (“Constitutional rights that\n\ncannot be enforced are illusory. It is as if those rights cease to exist as legal rights.”).\n\nEvading and delaying a decision on the merits of Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, and\n\nrequiring them to file seriatim challenges to “innumerable” statutes—each with the same,\n\ncommon legal issue—denies Plaintiffs access to justice just as clearly and as surely as if\n\nwe had simply padlocked the courthouse doors. No class of litigants should be burdened\n\nwith the emotional, financial, and time-related costs of this approach.         No class of\n\nlitigants should be treated in this draconian fashion.        Our decision today makes a\n\nmockery of this Court’s supposed commitment to access-to-justice principles. See In re\n\nthe Estab. of an Access to Just. Commn., No. AF 11-0765 (Mont. May 22, 2012).\n\n¶79    In light of the foregoing, I believe that rather than affirmatively protect Plaintiffs’\n\ncivil rights as they are sworn to do, the Attorney General, the Legislature, and now, sadly,\n\na majority of this Court have instead denied these persons justice and wrongly prolonged\n\nthe State’s discriminatory practices. In requiring Plaintiffs to jump through procedural\n\nhoops that we have never imposed on any other minority group, and in thus delaying the\n\nvindication of their constitutional rights, the Court conveys that gay, lesbian, and bisexual\n\nMontanans cannot expect to receive fairness, justice, respect, and equal treatment from\n\nMontana’s courts. As I said at the outset, this is a black day for civil rights in Montana.\n\n                                             46\n\f¶80    I now turn to a detailed discussion of the law supporting my conclusion that\n\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate here.\n\n                          III. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n\n¶81           Procedure should be the “handmaid of justice,” a means to\n              an end. Instead . . . procedure tends to become rigid,\n              stereotyped, and over-technical, an end in itself, often\n              seemingly oblivious to the practical needs of those to whose\n              ills it is designed to minister. Litigants thus often become\n              pawns in a game, the social cost of which is excessive and the\n              result of which is frequently unnecessarily cumbersome and\n              socially undesirable. Substantive rights often become the\n              incidents of procedural fencing. 4\n\n                                    A. Legal Principles\n\n¶82    The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act in 1922. The Act has been adopted, substantially as\n\ndrafted, in most states including Montana. See Unif. Declaratory Judms. Act, tbl. of jxns.\n\nand historical notes, 12 U.L.A. 331 (2008 & Supp. 2012); Mont. Code Ann., Annotations\n\n2012, at 1030; Title 27, chapter 8, MCA. The Act states that it is to be “so interpreted\n\nand construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states\n\nwhich enact it and to harmonize, as far as possible, with federal laws and regulations on\n\nthe subject of declaratory judgments and decrees.” Section 27-8-103, MCA. Thus, it is\n\nappropriate to consider decisions from other jurisdictions when applying the Act. See\n\ne.g. Beahringer v. Page, 789 N.E.2d 1216, 1223 (Ill. 2003) (“In interpreting the Illinois\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hayes, 499 N.W.2d 743, 746 (Mich. 1993) (ellipsis in\noriginal) (quoting Edwin Borchard, Declaratory Judgments xiii (2d ed. 1941)).\n                                            47\n\fdeclaratory judgment statute, Illinois courts may look to the decisions of other states in\n\ninterpreting the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.”).\n\n¶83    The purpose of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act “is to settle and to afford\n\nrelief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal\n\nrelations.” Section 27-8-102, MCA. The Act relieves litigants of the common-law rule\n\nthat no declaration of rights may be judicially adjudged unless a right has been violated.\n\nBoyds Civic Assn. v. Montgomery Co. Council, 526 A.2d 598, 602 (Md. 1987). In other\n\nwords, the Act renders disputes concerning legal rights and duties justiciable without\n\nproof of a wrong committed by one party against another. Hirschfield v. Bd. of Co.\n\nCommrs., 944 P.2d 1139, 1142 (Wyo. 1997); see also Beahringer, 789 N.E.2d at 1223\n\n(“The declaratory judgment procedure allows the court to take hold of a controversy one\n\nstep sooner than normally—that is, after the dispute has arisen, but before steps are taken\n\nwhich give rise to claims for damages or other relief. The parties to the dispute can then\n\nlearn the consequences of their action before acting.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n¶84    Thus, we have recognized that declaratory relief serves “to liquidate uncertainties\n\nand controversies which might result in future litigation.” In re Dewar, 169 Mont. 437,\n\n444, 548 P.2d 149, 154 (1976); accord Forty-Second Legis. Assembly v. Lennon, 156\n\nMont. 416, 421, 481 P.2d 330, 332 (1971) (“to eliminate or reduce a multiplicity of future\n\nlitigation”); Beahringer, 789 N.E.2d at 1223 (“ ‘to afford security and relief against\n\nuncertainty so as to avoid potential litigation’ ”). Through declaratory relief, “ ‘parties\n\nbetween whom an actual controversy exists or between whom litigation is inevitable are\n\nenabled to have the issues speedily determined where their determination would be\n\n                                            48\n\fdelayed to the possible injury of the one or the other if they were compelled to await the\n\ncourse of ordinary judicial proceedings.’ ” Automation Sys., Inc. v. Intel Corp., 501\n\nF. Supp. 345, 347 (S.D. Iowa 1980) (quoting Anthony William Deller, Walker on Patents\n\nvol. 8, § 617, 65 (2d ed. 1973)).       In this respect, “declaratory procedure operates\n\nprospectively, and not merely for the redress of past wrongs.              It serves to set\n\ncontroversies at rest before they lead to repudiation of obligations, invasion of rights or\n\ncommission of wrongs; in short, the remedy is to be used in the interests of preventive\n\njustice, to declare rights rather than execute them.” Babb v. Super. Ct., 479 P.2d 379, 383\n\n(Cal. 1971) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶85    To that end, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act confers on courts the “power\n\nto declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could\n\nbe claimed.” Section 27-8-201, MCA (emphasis added). The declaration “may be either\n\naffirmative or negative in form and effect,” and it has “the force and effect of a final\n\njudgment or decree.” Section 27-8-201, MCA. The Act specifically provides that\n\n       [a]ny person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other\n       writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal\n       relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or\n       franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity\n       arising under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and\n       obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\n\nSection 27-8-202, MCA. The Act further provides, however, that this enumeration “does\n\nnot limit or restrict the exercise of the general powers conferred in 27-8-201 in any\n\nproceeding where declaratory relief is sought in which a judgment or decree will\n\nterminate the controversy or remove an uncertainty.” Section 27-8-205, MCA. The Act\n\n\n                                             49\n\f“is to be liberally construed and administered,” § 27-8-102, MCA, and “[n]o action or\n\nproceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree\n\nis prayed for,” § 27-8-201, MCA.\n\n¶86    Lastly, it is well settled that declaratory procedure is appropriate to determine a\n\nconstitutional question or to test a constitutional right. See e.g. MEA-MFT v. McCulloch,\n\n2012 MT 211, 366 Mont. 266, ___ P.3d ___; Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., 2004 MT\n\n390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445; McGillivray v. State, 1999 MT 3, 293 Mont. 19, 972\n\nP.2d 804; McDonald v. State, 220 Mont. 519, 722 P.2d 598 (1986); Bd. of Regents v.\n\nJudge, 168 Mont. 433, 543 P.2d 1323 (1975). As the Washington Supreme Court has\n\nstated, “[d]eclaratory procedure is peculiarly well suited to the judicial determination of\n\ncontroversies concerning constitutional rights and . . . the constitutionality of legislative\n\naction or inaction.” Seattle Sch. Dist. v. State, 585 P.2d 71, 80 (Wash. 1978).\n\n                             B. The District Court’s Decision\n\n¶87    Given these principles, the District Court clearly had power “to declare [Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional] rights, status, and other legal relations”—whether or not further relief was\n\nor could be claimed—in order to “terminate the controversy” or “remove an uncertainty.”\n\nSections 27-8-201, -205, MCA. The District Court did not deny that it has this power; in\n\nfact, Plaintiffs reminded the District Court that it has this power in their motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment. The District Court, rather, simply failed to exercise it.\n\n¶88    At this juncture it is necessary to describe Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, which is\n\nattached as Appendix 2 to this Dissent. It consists of nine numbered paragraphs. The\n\nfirst five paragraphs seek declaratory relief—specifically, a “declaration” that the State’s\n\n                                              50\n\fcategorical exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections\n\nand obligations which the State makes available to different-sex couples violates five\n\nseparate rights in the Montana Constitution. The next two paragraphs seek injunctive\n\nrelief: that the State be enjoined “from continuing to deny Plaintiffs and their families\n\naccess to a legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations\n\nthe State provides to different-sex couples who marry,” and that the State be required “to\n\noffer same-sex couples and their families a legal status and statutory structure that\n\nconfers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples\n\nwho marry, but not the status or designation of marriage.” The final two paragraphs seek\n\ncosts, attorney’s fees, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper.\n\n¶89    Curiously, while five of the nine paragraphs in the Prayer for Relief seek\n\ndeclaratory relief, the District Court focused exclusively on the question of injunctive\n\nrelief. The court stated that “[t]he relief sought by Plaintiffs is contained in paragraph 7\n\nof their prayer for relief.” Paragraph 7 requests an order requiring the State to offer\n\nsame-sex couples and their families “a legal status and statutory structure that confers the\n\nprotections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples who marry,\n\nbut not the status or designation of marriage.” The District Court interpreted this to mean\n\nthat “Plaintiffs seek an order of this Court requiring the legislature to adopt a civil union\n\nor domestic partnership statutory scheme.”\n\n¶90    The District Court questioned whether the issuance of such an order would be an\n\nappropriate exercise of the court’s power. The District Court acknowledged that it has\n\npreviously been willing to exercise its judicial power when it found “a specific statute\n\n                                             51\n\fapplying to gay people” unconstitutional.         See Gryczan v. State, No. BDV-93-1869\n\n(Mont. 1st Jud. Dist. Feb. 16, 1996), aff’d, 283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997).\n\nHowever, the District Court distinguished the present case from Gryczan on the ground\n\nthat “what Plaintiffs want here is not a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a specific\n\nstatute or set of statutes, but rather a direction to the legislature to enact a statutory\n\narrangement.” The District Court opined that directing the Legislature to take such action\n\n“would launch this Court into a roiling maelstrom of policy issues without a\n\nconstitutional compass.” The District Court also felt that it could not issue such an order\n\nwithout knowing “all of the statutes that would be affected” (emphasis added).\n\n¶91    The District Court further acknowledged that it has previously declared a statutory\n\nscheme unconstitutional and allowed the Legislature broad discretion to correct the\n\nunconstitutional portions of the statutes. See Columbia Falls Elem. Sch. Dist. v. State,\n\nNo. BDV-02-0528 (Mont. 1st Jud. Dist. Apr. 15, 2004), aff’d, 2005 MT 69, 326 Mont.\n\n304, 109 P.3d 257. But the District Court viewed Columbia Falls as distinguishable from\n\nthe present case in that the court was dealing with “a discreet school funding formula”\n\nand “knew exactly what statutes would be affected” in the Columbia Falls case, whereas\n\nthe present case involves “a not yet entirely specified array of statutes that deal with\n\nmany different topics and were enacted over a variety of years.”\n\n¶92    The District Court thus reached “the jurisprudential decision that Plaintiffs’\n\nrequested relief constitutes an impermissible sojourn into the powers of the legislative\n\nbranch.” Citing “the constitutional separation of powers” (Mont. Const. art. III, § 1), the\n\nDistrict Court granted the Attorney General’s motion to dismiss. The District Court\n\n                                             52\n\fposited that the proper way to address Plaintiffs’ concerns would be through “specific\n\nsuits directed at specific, identifiable statutes.”\n\n¶93    With regard to the issue of injunctive relief, I do not fault Plaintiffs for including\n\nrequests for such relief in their complaint. It was their prerogative to do so. See Title 27,\n\nchapter 19, MCA. Likewise, however, I do not fault the District Court for declining to\n\norder injunctive relief at this stage. The District Court noted several factors which, in the\n\ncourt’s view, weighed against the issuance of a judicial order requiring the Legislature to\n\nenact the “statutory structure” requested by Plaintiffs. I cannot conclude that the District\n\nCourt abused its discretion in this regard. See Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. Pinnacle Bank,\n\n2012 MT 15, ¶ 13, 363 Mont. 366, 272 P.3d 635 (“the denial of a temporary or\n\npermanent injunction is reviewed for ‘manifest abuse of discretion’ ”).\n\n¶94    That being said, none of the factors identified by the District Court regarding\n\nPlaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief excuse or justify that court’s complete and utter\n\nfailure to grant Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief. It bears repeating that the\n\nDistrict Court had “power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or\n\nnot further relief is or could be claimed.” Section 27-8-201, MCA (emphasis added).\n\nIndeed, “ ‘[a] declaratory judgment or decree is one which simply declares the rights of\n\nthe parties or expresses the opinion of the court on a question of law, without ordering\n\nanything to be done; its distinctive characteristic being that the declaration stands by\n\nitself, and no executory process follows as of course . . . .’ ” Black v. Siler, 392 P.2d 572,\n\n574 (Ariz. 1964) (emphasis added) (quoting Clein v. Kaplan, 40 S.E.2d 133, 137 (Ga.\n\n1946)). The District Court had the power to issue a declaration if for no other reason than\n\n                                                53\n\fto “remove an uncertainty” regarding Plaintiffs’ rights. Section 27-8-205, MCA. Again,\n\nthe Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act “is to be liberally construed and administered,”\n\n§ 27-8-102, MCA, and “[n]o action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the\n\nground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for,” § 27-8-201, MCA. Thus, the\n\nfact that the District Court felt precluded from granting Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive\n\nrelief was not a valid legal basis for ignoring their requests for declaratory relief. These\n\nare distinct forms of relief, and a court’s ability to grant the latter does not depend in any\n\nway whatsoever on its ability to grant the former. Section 27-8-201, MCA.\n\n¶95    There is likewise no merit to the proposition that declaratory relief cannot be\n\ngranted without first identifying “all” of the statutes that would be affected by the ruling.\n\nFirst of all, as a factual matter, Plaintiffs provided the District Court with a list, appearing\n\nto be exhaustive, of the Montana statutes that confer benefits and protections on married\n\ncouples—benefits and protections that are unavailable to Plaintiffs because they cannot\n\nmarry. See Appendix 1 to this Dissent. The District Court thus had what it claimed it\n\nneeded: a list of “all of the statutes that would be affected” by the court’s ruling. Yet,\n\nrather than address Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory relief in light of this list—which\n\nPlaintiffs had provided at the District Court’s behest—the District Court inexplicably\n\ntook no action at all and thus caused their motion to alter or amend the judgment to be\n\ndenied by operation of law. See M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) (2009).\n\n¶96    Secondly, this same proposition—that declaratory relief cannot be granted without\n\nfirst identifying “all” of the statutes that would be affected by the ruling—was asserted,\n\nand rejected, in Spates v. Montgomery Co., 590 A.2d 1074, 1076 (Md. Spec. App. 1991).\n\n                                              54\n\fThere, the government argued that “by failing to identify particular statutes he regards as\n\nunconstitutional, Spates has not presented a justiciable issue.” Spates, 590 A.2d at 1077.\n\nThe Maryland Court of Special Appeals agreed that Spates’ complaint was “poorly drawn\n\nand seriously lacking in specifics.” Spates, 590 A.2d at 1077. Yet, the court observed\n\nthat Spates’ “basic point” was that the government’s failure to tax personal property\n\nplaced an unfair, disproportionate, and non-uniform tax burden on the owners of real\n\nproperty. Spates, 590 A.2d at 1077. From this, the court reasoned that\n\n       the failure to identify particular sections of the Tax-Property article of the\n       Code is really not telling in this case. Spates has challenged the system of\n       taxation authorized by law, which includes those sections defining terms,\n       imposing the property tax, determining the kinds of property to be taxed,\n       establishing the method of assessment, and providing for the collection of\n       the tax. Given the nature of his attack, it would, as he contends, be well-\n       nigh impossible, and quite unnecessary in our view, to pick through the\n       entire Tax Code and identify only those specific statutes or parts of statutes\n       that directly support the system he challenges.\n\nSpates, 590 A.2d at 1077.\n\n¶97    Plaintiffs’ challenge in the present case is not directed at Montana’s system of\n\ntaxation; it is directed at Montana’s system of statutory benefits and protections accorded\n\nto married couples. Nevertheless, Spates’ reasoning is pertinent here. Indeed, the fact\n\nthat the Legislature has spread the benefits and protections throughout the Code, rather\n\nthan collecting them all in a single title and chapter, cannot immunize the system from\n\nchallenge and review.\n\n¶98    The one feature common to each of the benefits and protections is that they are\n\ngranted to “spouses,” or on the basis of “marriage” to a “husband” or “wife.” Under\n\ncurrent Montana law, only heterosexuals and bisexuals in different-sex relationships can\n\n                                            55\n\fget “married” and thus become “spouses,” “husbands,” and “wives”; homosexuals and\n\nbisexuals in same-sex relationships are not allowed to marry. Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7;\n\n§§ 40-1-103, -401(1)(d), MCA; Black’s Law Dictionary 810, 1533, 1735 (spouse: “a\n\nmarried person”; husband: “[a] married man”; wife: “[a] married woman”). As a result,\n\nsame-sex couples are not encompassed within these benefits and protections. Plaintiffs\n\nchallenge this scheme as unconstitutional—i.e., the fact that the State systematically\n\ndenies them “the opportunity” to obtain the benefits and protections made available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples. Again, Plaintiffs do not ask to be married; they would be satisfied\n\nif “the opportunity” to obtain the benefits and protections were provided through some\n\nsort of alternative method distinct from “marriage.” Whether this claim implicates one\n\nstatute or a hundred, it is quite unnecessary for Plaintiffs to identify them all in this\n\nlawsuit in order to obtain a declaratory ruling. Paragraphs 1 through 5 of the Prayer for\n\nRelief seek only a “declaration” that this disparate treatment—the existence of which no\n\none disputes—violates the Montana Constitution. The District Court and this Court, in\n\nturn, may decree that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the opportunity to\n\nobtain the civil protections made available to different-sex couples, absent a compelling\n\nstate interest. Once that is done, the Legislature can identify the problem statutes and\n\namend them. Indeed, the Legislature did just that in 2009 when it passed House Bill 37,\n\ntitled “An Act Gender Neutralizing and Conforming Titles 10 through 90 of the Montana\n\nCode Annotated to Current Bill Drafting Standards . . . .” This single piece of legislation,\n\nthe text of which spans 967 pages of the 2009 Session Laws, simultaneously amended\n\n2,876 statutes. Surely if the Legislature can identify several thousand statutes needing to\n\n                                            56\n\fbe “gender neutralized,” the Legislature can identify a few hundred statutes needing to be\n\n“sexual-orientation neutralized.”\n\n¶99    We have said that “[t]he decision to dismiss a complaint for declaratory relief is\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the district court.” Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2003\n\nMT 103, ¶ 9, 315 Mont. 295, 69 P.3d 217. We have also held, however, that the\n\n“[f]ailure of a district court to exercise discretion is itself an abuse of discretion.” Clark\n\nFork Coalition v. Mont. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, 2008 MT 407, ¶ 43, 347 Mont. 197, 197\n\nP.3d 482; cf. Spates, 590 A.2d at 1076 (“Having failed to find a legitimate reason not to\n\ndeclare the rights of the parties, it was incumbent upon the court to do so.”). That is what\n\nhappened here when the District Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ complaint based on their\n\nrequested injunctive relief, without addressing their requested declaratory relief. In so\n\ndoing, the District Court wrongly conflated these two forms of relief. The District Court\n\nfailed to recognize that one of the purposes of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is\n\n“[t]o enable public duties and powers to be established without the cumbersome and\n\ntechnical prerequisites of mandamus, certiorari, injunction, prohibition, or habeas\n\ncorpus.” Edwin Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 288 (2d ed. 1941). The District Court\n\noverlooked the fact that while a motion to dismiss may be used in a declaratory judgment\n\nproceeding “to challenge the legal availability or appropriateness of the remedy,” a\n\nmotion to dismiss should “seldom, if ever, . . . be sustained or the complaint dismissed\n\nwithout a declaration one way or the other of the rights of the parties.” Spates, 590 A.2d\n\nat 1076 (emphases added, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Steffel v.\n\nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 468-69, 94 S. Ct. 1209, 1220 (1974) (a federal court has “the\n\n                                             57\n\fduty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective\n\nof its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction” (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)); James Wm. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice vol. 2, § 12.34[1][b],\n\n12-81 (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2012) (“Consistently with their obligation to construe\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations liberally, courts will not dismiss for failure to state a claim merely\n\nbecause the complaint requests inappropriate relief.”).\n\n¶100 I am thus in complete agreement with Plaintiffs’ statement, in their motion to alter\n\nor amend the judgment, that “dismissal of the entire action based solely on one request\n\nfor injunctive relief reflects a manifest error of law as there are five other requests for\n\ndeclaratory judgment upon which this Court may properly rule.” The District Court\n\nerred, as a matter of law, in its treatment of Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief, and\n\nthe District Court’s judgment must therefore be reversed to that extent.\n\n                       C. This Court’s “Justiciability” Rationale\n\n¶101 Like the District Court, this Court also lumps Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive\n\nrelief and declaratory relief into a single analysis. Opinion, ¶ 9. Doing so is error for the\n\nreasons just discussed. The Court does appear, however, to reject Plaintiffs’ claims using\n\na somewhat different rationale.      Specifically, the Court asserts that this case is not\n\n“justiciable” because a ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor “would not terminate the uncertainty or\n\ncontroversy giving rise to this proceeding” and because Plaintiffs are asking this Court to\n\n“determine speculative matters,” “declare social status,” “give advisory opinions,” or\n\n“give abstract opinions.” Opinion, ¶ 9. In all respects, the Court is mistaken.\n\n\n\n                                             58\n\f¶102 First of all, a declaratory judgment is itself “remedial.” Section 27-8-102, MCA.\n\nA declaratory judgment or decree is one which simply declares the rights of the parties or\n\nexpresses the opinion of the court on a question of law, without ordering anything to be\n\ndone; the declaration stands by itself, and no executory process follows as of course.\n\nBlack, 392 P.2d at 574; Clein, 40 S.E.2d at 137; § 27-8-201, MCA. The Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act permits courts “to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty\n\nand insecurity.” Section 27-8-102, MCA. A declaratory judgment is appropriate if for\n\nno other reason than to “remove an uncertainty.” Section 27-8-205, MCA.\n\n¶103 The Court’s contention that a declaratory judgment would not terminate the\n\nuncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding is simply untrue. There is no\n\ndispute that the State offers a variety of benefits and protections to committed intimate\n\ncouples, but only different-sex couples have the opportunity to obtain them. This regime\n\ngives preferential treatment to heterosexuals and bisexuals committed to a person of the\n\nopposite sex, and disfavors homosexuals and bisexuals committed to a person of the same\n\nsex.   Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory relief raise one legal question:         Is it\n\nconstitutionally permissible for the State to deny same-sex couples the opportunity to\n\nobtain the benefits and protections made available to different-sex couples? In other\n\nwords, is it constitutionally permissible for Montana’s government to treat Plaintiffs\n\ndifferently based on their sexual orientation? That is the “uncertainty or controversy” in\n\nthis case. We may resolve it—and, for the reasons detailed in the Constitutional Analysis\n\nsection below, I would resolve it—by holding that sexual orientation is a suspect class\n\nand that any disparate treatment between committed intimate same-sex couples and\n\n                                           59\n\fdifferent-sex married couples is subject to “strict scrutiny” review. Such a ruling would\n\nanswer and resolve Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory relief.\n\n¶104 Secondly, there is no merit to the Court’s suggestion that Plaintiffs have asked us\n\nto determine speculative matters, declare social status, or give an abstract opinion. This\n\ndismissive portrayal of Plaintiffs’ complaint is insulting and disrespectful. There is\n\nnothing “speculative” about the discrimination Plaintiffs have experienced—some of it\n\nprivate, some of it state-imposed—as described in their affidavits. The State itself does\n\nnot deny that Plaintiffs have suffered economic and emotional harm due to their sexual\n\norientation and that Plaintiffs’ relationships are treated differently than their different-sex\n\ncounterparts under the law. Plaintiffs do not ask or need this Court to declare their\n\n“social status.” Plaintiffs are acutely aware of their social status. They ask this Court,\n\nrather, to declare and uphold their constitutional rights. There is nothing “speculative” or\n\n“abstract” about this claim.\n\n¶105 Lastly, we have previously defined nonjusticiable advisory opinions as “opinions\n\nissued by the court in response to a request from some other branch of government, such\n\nas the legislative or executive, asking for information concerning matters of law.” In re\n\nSecret Grand Jury Inquiry, 170 Mont. 354, 357, 553 P.2d 987, 990 (1976). That clearly\n\nis not the case here. More recently, we have stated that an advisory opinion is “one\n\nadvising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts or upon an abstract\n\nproposition.” Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Regl. Airport Auth. Bd., 2010 MT 26, ¶ 12,\n\n355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. That too is not the case here. The underlying state of facts\n\nis not “hypothetical,” nor is the proposition “abstract.” Plaintiffs are being denied access\n\n                                              60\n\fto statutory benefits and protections which the State, in its discretion, has chosen to make\n\navailable to different-sex couples.\n\n¶106 In Secret Grand Jury Inquiry, this Court articulated what constitutes a “justiciable\n\ncontroversy” for purposes of obtaining a declaratory judgment:\n\n       First, a justiciable controversy requires that parties have existing and\n       genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interests. Second, the\n       controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may\n       effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate or argument invoking a\n       purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion.\n       Third, it must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will\n       have the effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the\n       rights, status or legal relationships of one or more of the real parties in\n       interest, or lacking these qualities be of such an overriding public moment\n       as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them.\n\n170 Mont. at 357, 553 P.2d at 990.\n\n¶107 We have repeated this test in numerous cases, 5 and recently applied the test in\n\nChipman v. N.W. Healthcare Corp., 2012 MT 242, ¶¶ 19-23, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d\n\n193. Here, the rights Plaintiffs invoke (Article II, Sections 3, 4, 10, and 17 of the\n\nMontana Constitution) are obviously not theoretical. They are “existing and genuine”\n\nconstitutional rights. Second, a judgment on whether the State may make statutory\n\nbenefits and protections available to different-sex couples, but categorically deny them to\n\n\n       5\n         See Lee v. State, 195 Mont. 1, 6, 635 P.2d 1282, 1284-85 (1981); Brisendine v.\nDept. of Commerce, 253 Mont. 361, 364, 833 P.2d 1019, 1021 (1992); Gryczan v. State,\n283 Mont. 433, 442, 942 P.2d 112, 117 (1997); Northfield Ins. Co. v. Mont. Assn. of\nCounties, 2000 MT 256, ¶ 12, 301 Mont. 472, 10 P.3d 813; Powder River County v.\nState, 2002 MT 259, ¶ 102, 312 Mont. 198, 60 P.3d 357; Montana-Dakota Utils.

Co., 2007 MT 85, ¶ 8, 337 Mont. 67, 155 P.3d 1278.\n                                            61\n\fsame-sex couples, “will effectively operate to settle the issues at hand.” Chipman, ¶ 22.\n\nI am not persuaded that it is necessary to litigate “the nature of the State’s interest” with\n\nrespect to each individual statute. Opinion, ¶ 13. But even assuming, for the sake of\n\nargument, that the nature of the State’s interest in excluding same-sex couples varies\n\nfrom statute to statute, the present action can definitively settle the nature of Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional rights—rights that are the same regardless of the statute at issue. There is\n\nno indication, therefore, that a declaration here would be “purely political, administrative,\n\nphilosophical or academic.” Chipman, ¶ 22. Finally, in considering “the main thrust” of\n\nthis lawsuit, Chipman, ¶ 23, this Court has been asked to determine the constitutional\n\nrelationship of the parties. In particular, we must determine whether the Constitution\n\nrequires that when the State offers legal benefits and protections to persons in committed\n\nintimate relationships, it must do so evenhandedly, without discriminating on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation.   This controversy directly involves the rights, status, and legal\n\nrelationships of the parties. Chipman, ¶ 23; see also Plan Helena, ¶ 9 (the controversy\n\nmust be “definite and concrete, touching legal relations of parties having adverse legal\n\ninterests” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, it is a justiciable controversy\n\nunder the foregoing three-part test.\n\n                                       D. Summary\n\n¶108 In sum, the Court errs in holding that this case is nonjusticiable. In adopting its\n\nstatute-by-statute approach, the Court not only fails to follow Montana’s own statutory\n\ncommands, but also sets itself apart as the non-uniform black sheep in the otherwise\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act states.\n\n                                             62\n\f¶109 Courts have “power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or\n\nnot further relief is or could be claimed.” Section 27-8-201, MCA. This power “is to be\n\nliberally construed and administered” to permit courts “to settle and to afford relief from\n\nuncertainty and insecurity.”     Section 27-8-102, -205, MCA.          Through a declaratory\n\njudgment proceeding, “a multiplicity of suits can be avoided, while an adequate,\n\nexpedient, and inexpensive remedy can be afforded for litigants in a single action.”\n\nThomas v. Cilbe, Inc., 104 So. 2d 397, 403 (Fla. App. 1958).\n\n¶110 Here, the declaratory issue is whether the Montana Constitution prohibits the State\n\nfrom excluding same-sex partners from the opportunity to obtain the benefits and\n\nprotections that the State makes available to different-sex partners. There is no need to\n\nidentify “all” of the potentially offending statutes in order to issue a ruling on this legal\n\nquestion, nor is there a need to pursue each statutory challenge separately. It is sufficient\n\nto declare the constitutional standard applicable to Plaintiffs’ claim—an issue which\n\nPlaintiffs have raised and briefed. And for the reasons discussed below, I would hold that\n\nsexual orientation is a suspect class under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana\n\nConstitution and that discrimination based on sexual orientation in the provision of\n\nstatutory benefits and protections is subject to “strict scrutiny” review. I would reverse\n\nthe District Court’s judgment and direct it to enter such an order. I dissent from this\n\nCourt’s failure and refusal to do so.\n\n¶111 As for the injunctions Plaintiffs request, I do not believe it is necessary to order\n\nsuch relief at this point. It is sufficient to declare Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights so as to\n\nremove the apparent uncertainty concerning those rights. Sections 27-8-201, -205, MCA.\n\n                                               63\n\fRather than proceed to direct the State how to remedy the problem, it is prudent to do\n\nwhat was done in the Columbia Falls and Snetsinger cases and permit the legislative and\n\nexecutive branches to address and resolve the matter in the first instance, in accordance\n\nwith our constitutional interpretation, as those officers are sworn to do (Mont. Const.\n\nart. III, § 3). See Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 279-80 (“The declaratory action\n\nproceeds on the assumption that a mild remedy will often satisfy, that responsible\n\ndefendants, like government officials or large corporations, do not need more than a\n\ndeclaration of the law to obey it and that a coercive procedure under such circumstances\n\nis an expensive and often unnecessary luxury.”). Indeed, this is exactly what happened\n\nfollowing our decision in Snetsinger, where we concluded that the Montana University\n\nSystem’s policy of treating unmarried same-sex couples differently than unmarried\n\ndifferent-sex couples in the provision of health benefits violated the Montana\n\nConstitution. Within three months, the Board of Regents had approved—unanimously,\n\nno less—a new insurance policy that would allow University System employees to obtain\n\nhealth coverage for gay and lesbian partners. See Regents Approve Same-Sex Insurance\n\nPolicy, Missoulian (Mar. 18, 2005).\n\n¶112 Plaintiffs here contend that entering a declaratory judgment regarding their\n\nconstitutional rights “would serve the courts’ primary function of adjudicating citizens’\n\nrights under the Constitution, while allowing the coordinate branches of government a\n\nreasonable opportunity to bring the State’s conduct into compliance with the\n\nConstitution.” I agree and, thus, would affirm the District Court’s denial of injunctive\n\nrelief, with the understanding that Plaintiffs may again pursue such relief if it becomes\n\n                                           64\n\fnecessary in the future to do so. See e.g. Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 886, 887 (Vt.\n\n1999) (“We hold only that plaintiffs are entitled under Chapter I, Article 7, of the\n\nVermont Constitution to obtain the same benefits and protections afforded by Vermont\n\nlaw to married opposite-sex couples. We do not purport to infringe upon the prerogatives\n\nof the Legislature to craft an appropriate means of addressing this constitutional mandate\n\n. . . . In the event that the benefits and protections in question are not statutorily granted,\n\nplaintiffs may petition this Court to order the remedy they originally sought.”).\n\n¶113 Having detailed my reasons for disagreeing with the District Court’s and this\n\nCourt’s procedural dispositions of the case, I now provide the legal analysis underlying\n\nmy conclusions that sexual orientation is a suspect class and, thus, that treating same-sex\n\ncouples differently than different-sex couples is subject to strict scrutiny review.\n\n                         IV. CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS\n\n¶114          [I]n view of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in\n              this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens.\n              There is no caste here. Our Constitution . . . neither knows\n              nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil\n              rights, all citizens are equal before the law. 6\n\n¶115 Plaintiffs contend that the State’s exclusion of same-sex couples from the\n\nopportunity to obtain the benefits and protections which the State makes available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples violates five fundamental constitutional rights: to pursue safety,\n\nhealth, and happiness (Mont. Const. art. II, § 3), to equal protection of the laws (§ 4), to\n\nindividual dignity (§ 4), to individual privacy (§ 10), and to due process of law (§ 17).\n\n\n       6\n         Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 1146 (1896) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting).\n                                              65\n\fBecause I conclude that the Equal Protection Clause (which happens to be Plaintiffs’\n\nprimary argument) is sufficient to resolve this case, I focus my analysis there and do not\n\naddress Plaintiffs’ arguments under Article II, Sections 3, 10, or 17. At the conclusion of\n\nmy equal protection discussion, however, I briefly discuss Article II, Section 4’s Dignity\n\nClause and the additional support it provides for Plaintiffs’ claim.\n\n                       A. Religious, Moral, and Political Beliefs\n\n¶116 At the outset, it is important to emphasize two preliminary points made by various\n\ncourts which have addressed these issues.\n\n¶117 First, although the question whether the State may exclude same-sex couples from\n\nthe benefits and protections that it provides to different-sex married couples “arouses\n\ndeeply-felt religious, moral, and political beliefs[, o]ur constitutional responsibility to\n\nconsider the legal merits of issues properly before us provides no exception for the\n\ncontroversial case.” Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 867 (Vt. 1999). Courts have a duty to\n\nuphold the constitutional rights of all parties, regardless of how unpopular they or their\n\ncause may be. See e.g. Gryczan v. State, 283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997) (upholding\n\nthe constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in private, consensual, noncommercial\n\nsexual conduct with other adults free of governmental interference or regulation); Texas\n\nv. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S. Ct. 2533 (1989) (upholding Johnson’s First Amendment\n\nright to burn an American flag); Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S. Ct. 1827\n\n(1969) (upholding a Ku Klux Klan leader’s First Amendment right to threaten\n\n“revengeance” if the “suppression” of the white race continues); Varnum v. Brien, 763\n\nN.W.2d 862, 875 (Iowa 2009) (a statute inconsistent with the Constitution “must be\n\n                                             66\n\fdeclared void, even though it may be supported by strong and deep-seated traditional\n\nbeliefs and popular opinion”); see also State v. Finley, 276 Mont. 126, 135, 915 P.2d 208,\n\n214 (1996) (this Court has the “obligation” to protect individual rights); Washington v.\n\nSeattle Sch. Dist., 458 U.S. 457, 486, 102 S. Ct. 3187, 3203 (1982) (the Judiciary has a\n\n“special role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to such a\n\nposition of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the\n\nmajoritarian political process” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Boyd v. United States,\n\n116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S. Ct. 524, 535 (1886) (“It is the duty of courts to be watchful for\n\nthe constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.”).\n\n¶118 Second, and along these same lines, the proper resolution of this case “does not\n\nturn on the religious or moral debate over intimate same-sex relationships, but rather on\n\nthe statutory and constitutional basis for the exclusion of same-sex couples from the\n\nsecular benefits and protections offered married couples.” Baker, 744 A.2d at 867. As\n\naptly stated by the United States Supreme Court,\n\n       for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual\n       conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious\n       beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the\n       traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but\n       profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to\n       which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These\n       considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is\n       whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views\n       on the whole society through operation of [its] law[s]. Our obligation is to\n       define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\n\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 571, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 2480 (2003) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Speaking to this same subject, this Court has likewise observed that\n\n\n                                             67\n\f       it is not the function of this or of any court to interpret the law on the basis\n       of what may be morally acceptable or unacceptable to society at any given\n       time. . . . Our Constitution does not protect morality; it does, however,\n       guarantee to all persons, whether in the majority or in a minority, those\n       certain basic freedoms and rights which are set forth in the Declaration of\n       Rights . . . . Regardless that majoritarian morality may be expressed in the\n       public-policy pronouncements of the legislature, it remains the obligation\n       of the courts—and of this Court in particular—to scrupulously support,\n       protect and defend those rights and liberties guaranteed to all persons under\n       our Constitution.\n\nGryczan, 283 Mont. at 454-55, 942 P.2d at 125; see also Alaska Civ. Liberties Union v.\n\nState, 122 P.3d 781, 783 (Alaska 2005) (“Irrelevant to our analysis must be personal,\n\nmoral, or religious beliefs—held deeply by many—about whether persons should enter\n\ninto intimate same-sex relationships or whether same-sex domestic partners should be\n\npermitted to marry.”).\n\n¶119 The upshot of these principles is that fundamental rights are not subject to filtering\n\nthrough the sieve of majoritarian morality or religious doctrine. Indeed, “the fact that the\n\ngoverning majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is\n\nnot a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor\n\ntradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.”\n\nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 577-78, 123 S. Ct. at 2483 (internal quotation marks omitted); see\n\nLoving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1817 (1967) (invaliding antimiscegenation\n\nlaws). The purpose of the federal Bill of Rights, like Montana’s Declaration of Rights,\n\n       was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political\n       controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and\n       to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One’s right\n       to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of\n       worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights [including equal\n\n\n                                             68\n\f       protection of the laws] may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the\n       outcome of no elections.\n\nWest Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638, 63 S. Ct. 1178, 1185-86\n\n(1943). Our responsibility “is to protect constitutional rights of individuals . . . even\n\nwhen the rights have not yet been broadly accepted, were at one time unimagined, or\n\nchallenge a deeply ingrained practice or law viewed to be impervious to the passage of\n\ntime.” Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 875.\n\n                             B. Equal Protection Principles\n\n¶120 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution both command that\n\nno person shall be denied “the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV;\n\nMont. Const. art. II, § 4. Although the basic principles underlying these two provisions\n\nare the same, this Court has held that Article II, Section 4 provides greater individual\n\nprotection than the Fourteenth Amendment. Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., 2004 MT\n\n390, ¶ 15, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445.\n\n¶121 “The guaranty of equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal\n\nlaws.” Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 1628 (1996) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). It is “essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated\n\nshould be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439,\n\n105 S. Ct. 3249, 3254 (1985); accord Snetsinger, ¶ 15.\n\n       “[T]here is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and\n       unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which\n       officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally.\n       Conversely, nothing opens the door to arbitrary action so effectively as to\n       allow those officials to pick and choose only a few to whom they will apply\n       legislation and thus to escape the political retribution that might be visited\n\n                                            69\n\f       upon them if larger numbers were affected. Courts can take no better\n       measure to assure that laws will be just than to require that laws be equal in\n       operation.”\n\nEisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 454, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 1038-39 (1972) (quoting Ry.\n\nExpress Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 112-13, 69 S. Ct. 463, 466-67 (1949)\n\n(Jackson, J., concurring)).    The Equal Protection guaranty “requires the democratic\n\nmajority to accept for themselves and their loved ones what they impose on you and me.”\n\nCruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 300-01, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 2863\n\n(1990) (Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n¶122 Of course, the “promise that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the\n\nlaws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one\n\npurpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons.” Romer,\n\n517 U.S. at 631, 116 S. Ct. at 1627. The general rule, therefore, is that if a law neither\n\nburdens a constitutional right nor targets a suspect or quasi-suspect class, then the courts\n\nwill uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relationship to some\n\nlegitimate governmental objective. However, if the classification disadvantages a suspect\n\nor quasi-suspect class or impinges upon the exercise of a constitutional right, then the\n\nclassification is subject to heightened scrutiny. See Romer, 517 U.S. at 631, 116 S. Ct. at\n\n1627; Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440-41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254-55; Snetsinger, ¶¶ 17-19.\n\n                                      C. Framework\n\n¶123 “Proper equal protection analysis involves identifying the classes involved,\n\ndetermining whether they are similarly situated and then using the appropriate level of\n\nscrutiny to determine if the statute is constitutional.” Bustell v. AIG Claims Serv., Inc.,\n\n                                             70\n\f2004 MT 362, ¶ 20, 324 Mont. 478, 105 P.3d 286; accord Reesor v. Montana State Fund,\n\n2004 MT 370, ¶¶ 10, 13, 15, 325 Mont. 1, 103 P.3d 1019. While we have stated the\n\n“similarly situated” requirement in numerous cases, see e.g. Snetsinger, ¶ 16; State v.\n\nEgdorf, 2003 MT 264, ¶ 15, 317 Mont. 436, 77 P.3d 517; Powell v. State Compen. Ins.\n\nFund, 2000 MT 321, ¶ 22, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877, we have not fleshed out the\n\nmeaning of this term. Federal caselaw provides some guidance on this point.\n\n¶124 The federal framework for analyzing equal protection claims is the same as the\n\nMontana framework. The first step is to identify the State’s classification of groups.\n\nFreeman v. City of Santa Ana, 68 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir. 1995). To accomplish this, a\n\nplaintiff can show that the law is applied in a discriminatory manner or imposes different\n\nburdens on different classes of people. Freeman, 68 F.3d at 1187. Once the plaintiff\n\nestablishes a governmental classification, it is necessary to identify a “similarly situated”\n\nclass against which the plaintiff’s class can be compared. Freeman, 68 F.3d at 1187.\n\nThis is necessary because “[d]iscrimination cannot exist in a vacuum; it can be found\n\nonly in the unequal treatment of people in similar circumstances.” Atty. Gen. of U.S. v.\n\nIrish People, Inc., 684 F.2d 928, 946 (D.C. Cir. 1982). “The goal of identifying a\n\nsimilarly situated class . . . is to isolate the factor allegedly subject to impermissible\n\ndiscrimination. The similarly situated group is the control group.” United States v.\n\nAguilar, 883 F.2d 662, 706 (9th Cir. 1989). Although the formula for determining\n\nwhether two groups are “similarly situated” for equal protection purposes “is not always\n\nsusceptible to precise demarcation,” Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2007), the question is essentially whether the plaintiff’s group is “roughly equivalent” to\n\n                                             71\n\fthe control group, Tapalian v. Tusino, 377 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004), in “all relevant\n\nrespects” other than the factor constituting the alleged discrimination, Aguilar, 883 F.2d\n\nat 706; Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 2331 (1992). “Exact\n\ncorrelation is neither likely nor necessary, but the cases must be fair congeners.”\n\nTapalian, 377 F.3d at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Lastly, if it is demonstrated\n\nthat a cognizable class is treated differently, the court analyzes whether the distinction\n\nmade between the groups is justified under the appropriate level of scrutiny. United\n\nStates v. Lopez-Flores, 63 F.3d 1468, 1472 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\n                 D. Classification and “Similarly Situated” Analysis\n\n¶125 As discussed, the State grants various benefits and obligations to married persons,\n\nwhich is accomplished through the use of such terms as “husband,” “wife,” “spouse,” or\n\n“married” in the various statutes. 7 The State contends, therefore, that the statutes create\n\n“a marital classification.” In the State’s view, “[t]he different classes involved here are\n\nmarried couples, who by definition are capable of receiving spousal benefits, and\n\n       7\n           See e.g. § 15-61-102(3), MCA (“ ‘Dependent’ means the spouse of the employee\nor account holder . . . .”); § 19-6-505(2), MCA (“Upon the retired member’s death, the\nretirement benefit must be paid to the member’s surviving spouse, if there is one.”);\n§ 27-1-515, MCA (“The rights of personal relations forbid . . . the abduction or\nenticement of a wife from the wife’s husband or a husband from the husband’s wife\n. . . .”); § 39-71-116(4), MCA (“ ‘Beneficiary’ means . . . a surviving spouse living with\nor legally entitled to be supported by the deceased at the time of injury . . . .”);\n§ 40-2-102, MCA (“Insofar as each is able, the husband and wife shall support each other\nout of their property and labor.”); § 40-2-108, MCA (“A married person may be a\npersonal representative, guardian, conservator, or trustee and may personally be bound\nand may bind the estate the person represents without any act or assent on the part of the\nperson’s spouse.”); § 50-9-106(2), MCA (“The authority to consent or to withhold\nconsent under subsection (1) may be exercised by the following individuals, in order of\npriority: (a) the spouse of the individual . . . .”); § 72-2-412, MCA (“A decedent’s\nsurviving spouse is entitled to a homestead allowance of $20,000.”).\n                                            72\n\funmarried couples, who by definition are not capable of receiving spousal benefits.” The\n\nState further argues that married couples and unmarried couples are not similarly situated\n\nbecause married couples are formally recognized under the law and unmarried couples\n\nare not. Thus, the State concludes that Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim must fail. One\n\nof the State’s amici (Montana Family Foundation) similarly argues that Plaintiffs’ claim\n\nfails because “all unmarried couples are treated alike under Montana law.”\n\n¶126 These arguments are incorrect—both in identifying the pertinent classification and\n\nin applying the “similarly situated” concept. It is true that the statutes, on their face,\n\nclassify based on marital status. But, as we have recognized, it is sometimes necessary to\n\nlook beyond the face of a classification in order to ascertain the true distinction being\n\ndrawn. In Bankers Life & Cas. Co. v. Peterson, 263 Mont. 156, 866 P.2d 241 (1993), for\n\nexample, this Court did not treat “normal pregnancy and childbirth” as a classification\n\nbetween pregnant persons and non-pregnant persons—the approach the State argues here.\n\nRather, we recognized that distinctions based on pregnancy are, in reality, sex-linked\n\nclassifications. “[A]ny classification which relies on pregnancy as the determinative\n\ncriterion is a distinction based on sex” because “it is the capacity to become pregnant\n\nwhich primarily differentiates the female from the male.” Bankers Life, 263 Mont. at\n\n160, 866 P.2d at 243 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶127 Likewise here, only different-sex couples have the capacity under current Montana\n\nlaw to get “married” and thereby become “spouses,” “husbands,” and “wives.” Same-sex\n\ncouples are not permitted to marry and are thus categorically excluded from the statutory\n\nbenefits and obligations granted to spouses, husbands, and wives. Mont. Const. art. XIII,\n\n                                           73\n\f§ 7; §§ 40-1-103, -401(1)(d), MCA; Black’s Law Dictionary 810, 1533, 1735 (spouse: a\n\nmarried person; husband: a married man; wife: a married woman). Different-sex\n\ncouples may obtain all of the benefits and obligations—by getting married. Same-sex\n\ncouples may not obtain any of the benefits and obligations—because they cannot get\n\nmarried. Thus, while the classification may appear on its face to be marital status, the\n\nstatutory definition of “spouse” is “[i]nherent” in this classification. Snetsinger, ¶ 20.\n\nAnd because marital status, by definition, is available only to different-sex couples, the\n\npertinent classification is sexual orientation.    Snetsinger, ¶ 27 (holding that sexual\n\norientation, not marital status, is “the defining difference” where “unmarried opposite-sex\n\ncouples are able to avail themselves of health benefits under the University System’s\n\npolicy while unmarried same-sex couples are denied the health benefits”).\n\n¶128 Indeed, if the State limited marriage to Caucasians, and then granted an array of\n\nstatutory benefits to such married couples, it would be ludicrous to argue—as the State\n\ndoes here—that “married couples qualify for spousal benefits not because they are\n\n[Caucasian] but because they are spouses.” This statement is simply wrong. Being\n\nCaucasian is, in fact, a prerequisite to qualifying for the benefits in this example, just as\n\nbeing heterosexual (or bisexual and committed to someone of the opposite sex) is a\n\nprerequisite to qualifying for the benefits in the present case. By granting benefits in a\n\nseemingly benign fashion to “spouses,” but then defining “spouses” to include only\n\nCaucasians, the relevant classification is race, not marital status. If the State limited the\n\nmeaning of “spouse” to Catholics, the classification would be religious affiliation. And\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\fby defining “spouse” to mean a member of a different-sex couple, the statutory scheme\n\ncreates a classification based on sexual orientation.\n\n¶129 It is perplexing that the State is even making the contrary argument, given the\n\nmultitude of courts that have already rejected it. In Tanner v. Oregon Health Sci. U., 971\n\nP.2d 435 (Or. App. 1998), for example, the governmental defendant argued that the\n\nbenefits at issue were “available to all on equal terms” because “[a]ll married\n\nemployees—heterosexual and homosexual alike—are permitted to acquire insurance\n\nbenefits for their spouses.” 971 P.2d at 447-48 (emphasis omitted). As the Oregon Court\n\nof Appeals observed, such reasoning “misses the point”: “Homosexual couples may not\n\nmarry. Accordingly, the benefits are not made available on equal terms. They are made\n\navailable on terms that, for gay and lesbian couples, are a legal impossibility.” Tanner,\n\n971 P.2d at 448. Similarly, the governmental defendants in Alaska Civ. Liberties Union\n\nargued that their programs differentiated on the basis of marital status, not sexual\n\norientation. The Alaska Supreme Court, however, concluded otherwise:\n\n              We agree with the plaintiffs that the proper comparison is between\n       same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples, whether or not they are\n       married. The municipality correctly observes that no unmarried employees,\n       whether they are members of same-sex or opposite-sex couples, can obtain\n       the disputed benefits for their domestic partners. But this does not mean\n       that these programs treat same-sex and opposite-sex couples the same.\n       Unmarried public employees in opposite-sex domestic relationships have\n       the opportunity to obtain these benefits, because employees are not\n       prevented by law from marrying their opposite-sex domestic partners. In\n       comparison, public employees in committed same-sex relationships are\n       absolutely denied any opportunity to obtain these benefits, because these\n       employees are barred by law from marrying their same-sex partners in\n       Alaska or having any marriage performed elsewhere recognized in Alaska.\n       Same-sex unmarried couples therefore have no way of obtaining these\n       benefits, whereas opposite-sex unmarried couples may become eligible for\n\n                                             75\n\f       them by marrying. The programs consequently treat same-sex couples\n       differently from opposite-sex couples.\n\nAlaska Civ. Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 788; accord Collins v. Brewer, 727 F.

Ct. at 2486-87\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (“While it is true that the law applies only to\n\nconduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being\n\nhomosexual. Under such circumstances, Texas’ sodomy law is targeted at more than\n\nconduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class.”).\n\n¶130 One of the fallacies in the State’s approach is that it denies the most fundamental\n\nand defining aspect of same-sex relationships. The State contends that “[l]aws granting\n\nspousal benefits do not discriminate against gays and lesbians any more than they\n\ndiscriminate against . . . other couples that may desire spousal benefits but do not qualify\n\nas spouses.” In other words, the State asserts, Plaintiffs “are situated no differently than\n\nunmarried different-sex partners.” Yet, as discussed above, different-sex partners may\n\nget married. And the State’s implication that Plaintiffs may do the same—albeit, to\n\nsomeone of the opposite sex—is absurd. As the California Supreme Court explained:\n\n       By limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, the marriage statutes,\n       realistically viewed, operate clearly and directly to impose different\n       treatment on gay individuals because of their sexual orientation. By\n       definition, gay individuals are persons who are sexually attracted to persons\n\n                                             76\n\f       of the same sex and thus, if inclined to enter into a marriage relationship,\n       would choose to marry a person of their own sex or gender. A statute that\n       limits marriage to a union of persons of opposite sexes, thereby placing\n       marriage outside the reach of couples of the same sex, unquestionably\n       imposes different treatment on the basis of sexual orientation. In our view,\n       it is sophistic to suggest that this conclusion is avoidable by reason of the\n       circumstance that the marriage statutes permit a gay man or a lesbian to\n       marry someone of the opposite sex, because making such a choice would\n       require the negation of the person’s sexual orientation. Just as a statute\n       that restricted marriage only to couples of the same sex would discriminate\n       against heterosexual persons on the basis of their heterosexual orientation,\n       the current California statutes realistically must be viewed as discriminating\n       against gay persons on the basis of their homosexual orientation.\n\nIn re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 440-41 (Cal. 2008) (emphasis added, footnote\n\nomitted). It should be noted that people have a constitutionally protected right under the\n\n“liberty” component of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and under the\n\n“privacy” provision of the Montana Constitution to choose a personal intimate\n\nrelationship with someone of the same sex. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 567, 123 S. Ct. at\n\n2478; Gryczan, 283 Mont. at 455-56, 942 P.2d at 125-26. It is not the State’s prerogative\n\nto prohibit such relationships. Nor, however, may the State seek to accomplish the same\n\nresult through coercive measures—such as by denying homosexuals and bisexuals the\n\nequal protection of the State’s secular laws when these individuals choose a partner of the\n\nsame sex, rather than one of the opposite sex.\n\n¶131 Another fallacy in the State’s argument is the mistaken perception that “similarly\n\nsituated” means “similar in the possession of the classifying trait.” When the government\n\ncreates a particular classification, there of course will be some who fall within that class\n\nand some who fall outside of it. It is incorrect to say, however, as the State does here,\n\nthat these two groups are not “similarly situated” because of the classification itself.\n\n                                            77\n\fSuch circular reasoning would effectively immunize every classification against equal\n\nprotection challenge. The Iowa Supreme Court discussed this point in Varnum:\n\n               In considering whether two classes are similarly situated, a court\n       cannot simply look at the trait used by the legislature to define a\n       classification under a statute and conclude a person without that trait is not\n       similarly situated to persons with the trait. The equal protection clause\n       does not merely ensure the challenged statute applies equally to all people\n       in the legislative classification. “Similarly situated” cannot mean simply\n       “similar in the possession of the classifying trait.” All members of any\n       class are similarly situated in this respect and consequently, any\n       classification whatsoever would be reasonable by this test. In the same\n       way, the similarly situated requirement cannot possibly be interpreted to\n       require plaintiffs to be identical in every way to people treated more\n       favorably by the law. No two people or groups of people are the same in\n       every way, and nearly every equal protection claim could be run aground\n       onto the shoals of a threshold analysis if the two groups needed to be a\n       mirror image of one another. Such a threshold analysis would hollow out\n       the constitution’s promise of equal protection.\n\n763 N.W.2d at 882-83 (citations, brackets, and some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶132 Having discussed the fallacies of the State’s approach, I turn to a proper “similarly\n\nsituated” analysis. Again, whether two classes are similarly situated depends on whether\n\nthey are roughly equivalent in all relevant respects besides the classifying trait adopted by\n\nthe State. Tapalian, 377 F.3d at 6; Aguilar, 883 F.2d at 706. The inquiry is not whether\n\npersons are similarly situated for all purposes, but whether they are similarly situated for\n\npurposes of the law challenged. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 422; accord Varnum, 763 N.W.2d\n\nat 883 (“the equal protection guarantee requires that laws treat all those who are similarly\n\nsituated with respect to the purposes of the law alike” (emphasis in original)).\n\n¶133 In Snetsinger, ¶ 27, this Court concluded that unmarried different-sex couples and\n\nunmarried same-sex couples, “although similarly situated in all respects other than sexual\n\n\n                                             78\n\forientation,” were not being treated “equally and fairly” because the former group had the\n\nability to obtain the health benefits provided by the Montana University System and the\n\nlatter group did not. That conclusion is on point here: unmarried different-sex couples\n\nare able to obtain the various benefits provided by the State, while unmarried same-sex\n\ncouples are not able to obtain those benefits. Although the Court in Snetsinger did not\n\ndiscuss its conclusion on the “similarly situated” requirement in much detail, a number of\n\nother courts have provided persuasive analyses on this point.\n\n¶134 The Iowa Supreme Court, for example, concluded in Varnum that “for purposes of\n\nIowa’s marriage laws, which are designed to bring a sense of order to the legal\n\nrelationships of committed couples and their families in myriad ways,” the plaintiffs (six\n\nsame-sex couples) “are similarly situated compared to heterosexual persons” “in every\n\nimportant respect, but for their sexual orientation.” 763 N.W.2d at 883-84.\n\n      Plaintiffs are in committed and loving relationships, many raising families,\n      just like heterosexual couples. Moreover, official recognition of their status\n      provides an institutional basis for defining their fundamental relational\n      rights and responsibilities, just as it does for heterosexual couples. Society\n      benefits, for example, from providing same-sex couples a stable framework\n      within which to raise their children and the power to make health care and\n      end-of-life decisions for loved ones, just as it does when that framework is\n      provided for opposite-sex couples.\n\nVarnum, 763 N.W.2d at 883.\n\n¶135 The Connecticut Supreme Court likewise determined that the plaintiffs there (eight\n\nsame-sex couples) “share the same interest in a committed and loving relationship as\n\nheterosexual persons who wish to marry, and they share the same interest in having a\n\nfamily and raising their children in a loving and supportive environment.” Kerrigan, 957\n\n\n                                            79\n\fA.2d at 424.    The court noted that the plaintiffs met the same statutory eligibility\n\nrequirements applicable to persons who seek to marry, including restrictions related to\n\npublic safety, such as age and consanguinity. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 424.\n\n¶136 Addressing this question, the California Supreme Court observed that\n\n      [b]oth groups at issue consist of pairs of individuals who wish to enter into\n      a formal, legally binding and officially recognized, long-term family\n      relationship that affords the same rights and privileges and imposes the\n      same obligations and responsibilities. Under these circumstances, there is\n      no question but that these two categories of individuals are sufficiently\n      similar . . . .\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 435 n. 54 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶137 In Baker, the principal purpose the government advanced in support of excluding\n\nsame-sex couples from the legal benefits of marriage was the interest in “ ‘furthering the\n\nlink between procreation and child rearing.’ ” 744 A.2d at 881. The Vermont Supreme\n\nCourt agreed that “the State has a legitimate and long-standing interest in promoting a\n\npermanent commitment between couples for the security of their children” and that “the\n\nState’s interest has been advanced by extending formal public sanction and protection to\n\nthe union, or marriage, of those couples considered capable of having children.” Baker,\n\n744 A.2d at 881. The court further observed, however, “that a significant number of\n\nchildren today are actually being raised by same-sex parents, and that increasing numbers\n\nof children are being conceived by such parents through a variety of assisted-reproductive\n\ntechniques.” Baker, 744 A.2d at 881. The court reasoned, therefore,\n\n      to the extent that the state’s purpose in licensing civil marriage was, and is,\n      to legitimize children and provide for their security, the statutes plainly\n      exclude many same-sex couples who are no different from opposite-sex\n      couples with respect to these objectives. If anything, the exclusion of\n\n                                            80\n\f      same-sex couples from the legal protections incident to marriage exposes\n      their children to the precise risks that the State argues the marriage laws are\n      designed to secure against. In short, the marital exclusion treats persons\n      who are similarly situated for purposes of the law, differently.\n\nBaker, 744 A.2d at 882 (emphases in original).\n\n¶138 Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921 (N.D. Cal. 2010), involved a\n\nconstitutional challenge to Proposition 8, which amended California’s Constitution to\n\nrestrict marriage to one man and one woman. The federal district court held a bench trial\n\nduring which it heard lay and expert testimony on various issues, including whether\n\nsame-sex couples are inferior to or materially distinct from different-sex couples. The\n\nfederal district court’s decision is discussed in greater detail below in the Marriage\n\nAmendment section. See ¶¶ 183-189, infra. For purposes of the present discussion, it is\n\nsufficient to note the following testimony and factual findings made by the court:\n\n      • “Gay and lesbian sexual orientations are ‘normal variation[s] and are considered\n        to be aspects of well-adjusted behavior.’ ”\n\n      • “Homosexuality is not considered a mental disorder. . . . [M]ajor professional\n        mental health associations have all gone on record affirming that homosexuality\n        is a normal expression of sexuality and that it is not in any way a form of\n        pathology.”\n\n      • “ ‘Courts and legal scholars have concluded that sexual orientation is not related\n        to an individual’s ability to contribute to society or perform in the workplace.’ ”\n\n      • “Same-sex couples are identical to opposite-sex couples in the characteristics\n        relevant to the ability to form successful marital unions. Like opposite-sex\n        couples, same-sex couples have happy, satisfying relationships and form deep\n        emotional bonds and strong commitments to their partners. Standardized\n        measures of relationship satisfaction, relationship adjustment and love do not\n        differ depending on whether a couple is same-sex or opposite-sex.”\n\n      • “Same-sex couples receive the same tangible and intangible benefits from\n        marriage that opposite-sex couples receive,” including “greater commitment to\n\n                                            81\n\f        the relationship, more acceptance from extended family, less worry over legal\n        problems, [and] greater access to health benefits and benefits for their children.”\n\n       • “The sexual orientation of an individual does not determine whether that\n         individual can be a good parent. Children raised by gay or lesbian parents are as\n         likely as children raised by heterosexual parents to be healthy, successful and\n         well-adjusted. The research supporting this conclusion is accepted beyond\n         serious debate in the field of developmental psychology.”\n\n       • “The evidence shows that, by every available metric, opposite-sex couples are\n         not better than their same-sex counterparts; instead, as partners, parents and\n         citizens, opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples are equal.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 967, 969, 980, 1002.\n\n¶139 These findings are consistent with the record in the present case. Plaintiffs filed\n\nthe affidavit of Dr. Letitia Anne Peplau, a psychologist, who states: “Research clearly\n\nestablishes that same-sex couples closely resemble heterosexual couples both in terms of\n\nthe quality of their relationship and the processes that affect their relationships.” The\n\nState does not deny this. Plaintiffs also filed the affidavit of Dr. Suzanne D. Dixon, a\n\nbehavioral and developmental pediatrician, who states: “Children raised by same-sex\n\nparents are just as likely to be psychologically, emotionally, socially and sexually well\n\nadjusted as those raised by heterosexual parents. Being parented by gay, lesbian or\n\nbisexual parents has no adverse impact on the behavior and development of children.”\n\nThe State does not deny this either. In fact, the State does not deny that Plaintiffs are\n\nsimilarly situated to different-sex couples in every respect other than the ability to obtain\n\nthe secular benefits and obligations at issue here by getting married.\n\n¶140 I agree with the Iowa Supreme Court that the benefits and responsibilities granted\n\nby the State to married persons “are designed to bring a sense of order to the legal\n\n\n                                             82\n\frelationships of committed couples and their families in myriad ways”—for example, by\n\nproviding a stable framework within which to raise children and the power to make\n\nhealthcare decisions for loved ones. Varnum 763 N.W.2d at 883-84. Plaintiffs indicate\n\nin their affidavits that they share the same interest as different-sex couples in protecting\n\ntheir relationships, their families, and their children. Except for the fact that one partner\n\nis the same sex as the other, Plaintiffs’ committed intimate relationships are materially\n\nindistinguishable from different-sex committed intimate relationships.\n\n¶141 Based on these undisputed facts and the foregoing discussion, I conclude and\n\nwould hold that the pertinent classification here is sexual orientation. I further conclude\n\nand would hold that Plaintiffs are similarly situated to, but treated differently than,\n\ndifferent-sex couples vis-à-vis the benefits and responsibilities afforded by the State to\n\nmarried persons. I now turn to the question of the appropriate level of scrutiny.\n\n                                   E. Level of Scrutiny\n\n¶142 As noted above, if a law neither burdens a constitutional right nor targets a suspect\n\nor quasi-suspect class, then the courts will uphold the legislative classification so long as\n\nit bears a rational relationship to some legitimate governmental objective. But if the law\n\ndisadvantages a suspect or quasi-suspect class or impinges upon the exercise of a\n\nconstitutional right, then the classification is subject to heightened scrutiny. See Romer,\n\n517 U.S. at 631, 116 S. Ct. at 1627; Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440-41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254-55;\n\nSnetsinger, ¶¶ 17-19.\n\n¶143 In Snetsinger, this Court concluded that the Montana University System’s policy\n\nof allowing unmarried different-sex couples to avail themselves of the health benefits\n\n                                             83\n\foffered under the University System’s group health insurance plan, while denying\n\nunmarried same-sex couples the ability to obtain these same benefits, failed even the\n\nmost deferential standard of review: “there is no justification for treating the two groups\n\ndifferently, nor is the University System’s policy rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest.” Snetsinger, ¶ 27.\n\n¶144 In the present case, Plaintiffs likewise argue that the State’s exclusion of same-sex\n\ncouples from the opportunity to obtain the benefits and protections which the State makes\n\navailable to different-sex couples fails rational basis review. Plaintiffs further argue,\n\nhowever, that “sexual orientation should be considered a suspect classification under\n\nMontana law” and that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is therefore\n\nsubject to “strict scrutiny.” For purposes of resolving Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory\n\nrelief, and for the reasons which follow, I agree that sexual orientation is a suspect class\n\nand that treating same-sex couples differently than different-sex couples is thus subject to\n\nstrict scrutiny review.\n\n¶145 Courts have identified four factors or indicia as bearing on whether a class is\n\nsuspect or quasi-suspect (thus warranting a more exacting constitutional analysis of the\n\nlegislative classification than that provided by rational basis review).         They are\n\n(1) whether the class has historically been subjected to discrimination; (2) whether the\n\ncharacteristics that distinguish the class indicate a typical class member’s ability to\n\nperform or contribute to society; (3) whether the distinguishing characteristic is\n\nimmutable or beyond the class members’ control; and (4) whether the class is a minority\n\nor politically powerless. See In re C.H., 210 Mont. 184, 198, 683 P.2d 931, 938 (1984)\n\n                                            84\n\f(citing San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 1294\n\n(1973)); Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 181 (2d Cir. 2012); Marriage Cases,\n\n183 P.3d at 442-43; Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 426; Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 886-88;\n\nConaway, 932 A.2d at 606-07; Andersen v. King County, 138 P.3d 963, 974 (Wash.\n\n2006). The third and fourth factors (immutability and lack of political power), however,\n\n“are not strictly necessary factors to identify a suspect class.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 181.\n\nIndeed, as to immutability, the California Supreme Court has pointed out that, under\n\nCalifornia law, “a person’s religion is a suspect classification for equal protection\n\npurposes, and one’s religion, of course, is not immutable but is a matter over which an\n\nindividual has control.” Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (citations omitted). Likewise,\n\nas to lack of political power, the California Supreme Court has pointed out that “if a\n\ngroup’s current political powerlessness were a prerequisite to a characteristic’s being\n\nconsidered a constitutionally suspect basis for differential treatment, it would be\n\nimpossible to justify the numerous decisions that continue to treat sex, race, and religion\n\nas suspect classifications.” Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 443 (emphasis in original); see\n\nalso Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 426 (characterizing history of discrimination and ability to\n\nperform or contribute to society as “required” factors, and immutability and political\n\npowerlessness as “other considerations that, in a given case, may be relevant” (citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n¶146 In the present case, the parties’ disagreement centers primarily on the first and\n\nfourth factors—history of discrimination and lack of political power. In considering the\n\nfour factors, therefore, I shall focus primarily on these two.\n\n                                             85\n\f                              1. History of Discrimination\n\n¶147 As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently observed, “[i]t is easy to\n\nconclude that homosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination.” Windsor, 699 F.3d\n\nat 182. Indeed, as I discussed in my Snetsinger concurrence, “[i]t is overwhelmingly\n\nclear that gays and lesbians have been historically subject to unequal treatment and\n\ninvidious discrimination.” Snetsinger, ¶¶ 45-53 (Nelson, J., specially concurring); accord\n\nVarnum 763 N.W.2d at 889-90; Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 432-34. “Outside of racial and\n\nreligious minorities, we can think of no group which has suffered such pernicious and\n\nsustained hostility, and such immediate and severe opprobrium, as homosexuals.”\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (bracketed material and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   “Perhaps the most telling proof of animus and discrimination against\n\nhomosexuals in this country is that, for many years and in many states, homosexual\n\nconduct was criminal.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 182. In point of fact, although this Court\n\nheld 15 years ago that homosexuals have the right under Montana’s Constitution to\n\nengage in private, consensual, noncommercial sexual conduct with other adults free of\n\ngovernmental interference or regulation, Gryczan, 283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112, the\n\nLegislature has repeatedly refused in multiple subsequent legislative sessions to repeal\n\nthe statutory criminalization of “sexual contact or sexual intercourse between two persons\n\nof the same sex,” §§ 45-2-101(21), 45-5-505, MCA; Aff. of Christine Kaufmann at 4 &\n\nAttachment A (detailing the failed efforts to repeal this statutory language).\n\n¶148 Plaintiffs filed the affidavit of Dr. George Chauncey, a professor of history at Yale\n\nUniversity. Dr. Chauncey states that, in his professional opinion, “gay and lesbian people\n\n                                             86\n\fhave been subject to widespread and significant discrimination and hostility in the United\n\nStates, including the State of Montana.” He notes that among the most conspicuous\n\nlegacies of this discrimination are “the numerous state statutes and constitutional\n\namendments that brand gays and lesbians as second-class citizens by denying them the\n\nright to marry the person they love” and “the federal Defense of Marriage Act that\n\nprohibits the federal government from recognizing such marriages legally entered into in\n\nstates where they are allowed.” Dr. Chauncey provides a detailed historical record of\n\nanti-gay discrimination and the roots of such discrimination. Aff. of George Chauncey,\n\nPh.D., at 3-22. His discussion is extensive, spanning 20 single-spaced pages, and it is not\n\npossible to recite every example of anti-gay discrimination and violence he describes. I\n\nshall attempt, however, to highlight the main points of his discussion.\n\n¶149 Dr. Chauncey explains that through much of the twentieth century, in particular,\n\ngay men and lesbians have suffered under the weight of medical theories that treated their\n\ndesires as a disorder, penal laws that condemned their consensual adult sexual behavior\n\nas a crime, and federal and state civil statutes, regulations, and policies that discriminated\n\nagainst them on the basis of their sexual orientation. Beginning in the 1930s and 1940s,\n\nmany states prohibited gay people from being served in restaurants and bars. In the\n\n1950s, the federal government banned the employment of homosexuals and insisted that\n\nits private contractors ferret out and dismiss their gay employees. Across the century,\n\nmany municipalities periodically launched police campaigns to suppress gay meeting\n\nplaces and sought to purge gay civil servants from government employment. Many\n\nclergy condemned homosexuality as sinful. Leading physicians and medical researchers\n\n                                             87\n\fclaimed that homosexuality was a pathological condition or disease. Government leaders\n\nand the media justified anti-gay discrimination and the suppression of gay meeting places\n\nby fostering stereotypes of homosexuals as child molesters. These stereotypes have had\n\nenduring consequences and continue to inspire public fears and hostility, especially\n\nconcerning gay teachers and parents.      In the 1990s, following Anita Bryant’s lead,\n\nactivists opposed to gay rights frequently fomented voter fear of gay people by reviving\n\ndemonic stereotypes of homosexuals as perverts who threatened the nation’s children and\n\nmoral character. Such tactics have been invoked in Montana. In 1995, the Montana\n\nSenate included homosexual acts in a bill requiring the registration of sexual and violent\n\noffenders. Senator Al Bishop, a supporter of the bill, stated on the Senate floor that\n\nhomosexual sex is “even worse than a violent sexual act.” During a 2003 debate over\n\nkeeping Montana’s criminal sodomy law on the books—despite this Court’s decision in\n\nGryczan—a member of the Coalition for Community Responsibility asserted that “[g]ay\n\nmen think they are doing children a favor by sodomizing them.” During the 2005\n\nlegislative session, Senator Dan McGee of Laurel stated, “I’ll never be able to support\n\nbills which try to overturn centuries of moral ideology. Homosexuality is wrong.” In\n\n2010, opponents of the Missoula ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual\n\norientation and gender identity stated that passage of the ordinance would result in\n\n“unacceptable loss of safety and privacy for women and children.” Numerous bills have\n\nbeen proposed to add sexual orientation to Montana’s antidiscrimination laws and to\n\nMontana’s hate-crimes law, but all have failed. (Christine Kauffman details the repeated\n\ndefeat of such legislation in Attachment A to her affidavit, at pages 3 to 7.) Earlier this\n\n                                            88\n\fyear, the Hamilton School Board voted to remove sexual orientation from a proposed\n\nanti-bullying policy and not to include sexual orientation in the district’s equal-education\n\nand equal-employment policies. See David Erickson, Sexual Orientation Not Included in\n\nHamilton Schools’ Anti-Bullying Policy, Ravalli Republic (Mar. 30, 2012).\n\n¶150 Dr. Chauncey notes that gay people continue to face discrimination from highly\n\nregarded institutions. For example, the Boy Scouts of America, a federally chartered\n\norganization, insists that “homosexual conduct is not morally straight” and refuses to\n\nallow gay men into the organization. Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 651,\n\n120 S. Ct. 2446, 2453 (2000). Gay people also continue to face violence motivated by\n\nanti-gay bias. In 1984, three teens attacked 23-year-old Charlie Howard due to his sexual\n\norientation and threw him off a bridge into the Kenduskeag Stream in Maine, where he\n\ndrowned. In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a college student in Wyoming, was bound, tied to a\n\nfence, beaten with a pistol, and left to die because he was gay. In 2008, Lawrence Fobes\n\nKing, a 15-year-old student in California, died two days after he was shot in school by a\n\nfellow student because of his sexual orientation. The FBI reported 1,260 hate crimes\n\nbased on perceived sexual orientation in 1998 and 1,297 in 2008.\n\n¶151 In its Order, the District Court observed that “there appears little doubt that\n\nPlaintiffs have been subject to private prejudice, discrimination, and even violence in\n\nMontana.” Indeed, Plaintiffs describe various ways in which they have been harassed\n\nbecause of their sexual orientation. One plaintiff, for example, was labeled a “lesbian\n\nbaby-killer” on a neo-Nazi website, and “wanted dead or alive” posters of her were hung\n\nin downtown Bozeman, causing her to fear for her physical safety. Another plaintiff,\n\n                                            89\n\fwho grew up in Great Falls and worked at the Cascade County Regional Youth Services\n\nCenter for several years, describes an incident when a Cascade County Commissioner\n\nconfronted her and told her that gay people are dangerous and should not be allowed to\n\nwork with youth. Plaintiffs describe demeaning instances where employers, healthcare\n\nworkers, and others refused to recognize or honor their same-sex relationships.\n\n¶152 The State concedes that “gays and lesbians have been subject to private prejudice,\n\ndiscrimination, and violence in Montana” (emphasis added). But the State contends that\n\nPlaintiffs “have yet to identify a single instance of any targeted State action against them\n\nthat they ask the Court to review and invalidate.” This contention is simply bizarre. The\n\nquestion at hand is whether gays and lesbians have suffered a history of discrimination.\n\nClearly they have. The State’s suggestion that all of the prejudice and discrimination has\n\nbeen purely “private” is utterly ridiculous. Indeed, the State’s position flies in the face of\n\nthe substantial evidence presented in the District Court, none of which the State refuted.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious evidence of “public” discrimination against gays and lesbians\n\nis the codification of disparate treatment in at least three Montana statutes (§§ 40-1-103,\n\n40-1-401(1)(d), and 45-2-101(21), MCA), not to mention the Montana Constitution itself\n\n(Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7). The State implies that there was not “any expressed animus\n\nunderlying the approval of CI-96.” (CI-96 refers to Constitutional Amendment 96, the\n\n2004 ballot measure which added the Marriage Amendment to Montana’s Constitution.)\n\nBut as discussed in the Marriage Amendment section below, that provision demonstrably\n\nwas motivated by animus toward gays and lesbians. The State fails to provide any\n\n\n\n                                             90\n\fevidence or sensible argument to refute Plaintiffs’ overwhelming showing that\n\nhomosexuals as a group have historically endured persecution and discrimination.\n\n                                    2. Relation to Ability\n\n¶153 “There are some distinguishing characteristics, such as age or mental handicap,\n\nthat may arguably inhibit an individual’s ability to contribute to society, at least in some\n\nrespect. But homosexuality is not one of them. The aversion homosexuals experience\n\nhas nothing to do with aptitude or performance.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 182-83; accord\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (“sexual orientation is a characteristic . . . that bears no\n\nrelation to a person’s ability to perform or contribute to society”); Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n435 (“homosexuality bears no relation at all to an individual’s ability to contribute fully\n\nto society”; “an individual’s homosexual orientation implies no impairment in judgment,\n\nstability, reliability or general social or vocational capabilities” (brackets and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Varnum 763 N.W.2d at 891 (“sexual orientation is broadly\n\nrecognized in Iowa to be irrelevant to a person’s ability to contribute to society”). The\n\nState does not contend otherwise.\n\n¶154 A classification which bears no relationship to a person’s ability to contribute to\n\nsociety “is likely based on irrelevant stereotypes and prejudice.” Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at\n\n890. A classification unrelated to a person’s ability to perform or contribute to society\n\ntypically reflects prejudice and antipathy—a view that those in the burdened class are not\n\nas worthy or deserving as others—or reflects outmoded notions of the relative capabilities\n\nof persons with the characteristic. Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 890; Cleburne, 473 U.S. at\n\n440-41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254-55. Such is the case here.\n\n                                             91\n\f                                      3. Immutability\n\n¶155 Although often couched in terms of “immutability,” the Second Circuit explained\n\nin Windsor that the question under this factor is whether there are obvious, immutable, or\n\ndistinguishing characteristics that define a discrete group. 699 F.3d at 183. For instance,\n\nclassifications based on alienage, illegitimacy, and national origin are all subject to\n\nheightened scrutiny, even though these characteristics do not declare themselves, and\n\noften may be disclosed or suppressed as a matter of preference, and even though alienage\n\nand illegitimacy are actually subject to change. “What seems to matter is whether the\n\ncharacteristic of the class [invites] discrimination when it is manifest.” Windsor, 699\n\nF.3d at 183. Here, the characteristic that distinguishes gays and lesbians from others and\n\nqualifies them for recognition as a distinct and discrete group is the characteristic that\n\nhistorically has resulted in their social and legal ostracism: their attraction to persons of\n\nthe same sex. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 436; accord Windsor, 699 F.3d at 184 (“sexual\n\norientation is a sufficiently distinguishing characteristic to identify the discrete minority\n\nclass of homosexuals”); Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 964 (“[s]exual orientation is\n\nfundamental to a person’s identity and is a distinguishing characteristic that defines gays\n\nand lesbians as a discrete group”).\n\n¶156 To the extent that “immutability” has any significance to the analysis, this prong\n\nof the inquiry is satisfied when the identifying trait is so central to a person’s identity that\n\nit would be abhorrent for government to penalize a person for refusing to change it.\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 438; Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 893; Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d\n\n699, 726 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc) (Norris, J., concurring in the judgment). In this\n\n                                              92\n\fregard, the federal district court in Perry found, based on the evidence presented, that\n\n“[i]ndividuals do not generally choose their sexual orientation. No credible evidence\n\nsupports a finding that an individual may, through conscious decision, therapeutic\n\nintervention or any other method, change his or her sexual orientation.” 704 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 966.   The court noted that sexual orientation is “an enduring pattern of sexual,\n\naffectional or romantic desires for and attractions to men, women or both sexes” and that\n\n“[t]he vast majority of people are consistent in self-identification, behavior and attraction\n\nthroughout their adult lives. Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 964. Accordingly, I agree with the\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court that “[b]ecause a person’s sexual orientation is so integral an\n\naspect of one’s identity, it is not appropriate to require a person to repudiate or change his\n\nor her sexual orientation in order to avoid discriminatory treatment.” Marriage Cases,\n\n183 P.3d at 442; accord Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 893 (“Accordingly, because sexual\n\norientation is central to personal identity and may be altered if at all only at the expense\n\nof significant damage to the individual’s sense of self, classifications based on sexual\n\norientation are no less entitled to consideration as a suspect or quasi-suspect class than\n\nany other group that has been deemed to exhibit an immutable characteristic.” (brackets\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                    4. Political Power\n\n¶157 The last factor is premised on the notion that “[w]ithout political power, minorities\n\nmay be unable to protect themselves from discrimination at the hands of the majoritarian\n\npolitical process.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 184. As noted, the Judiciary has a “special role\n\nin safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to such a position of\n\n                                             93\n\fpolitical powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian\n\npolitical process.” Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist., 458 U.S. 457, 486, 102 S. Ct. 3187,\n\n3203 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶158 While the State’s central argument on this point is devoted to the proposition that\n\ngays and lesbians have achieved some recent political successes,\n\n       [t]he question is not whether homosexuals have achieved political\n       successes over the years; they clearly have. The question is whether they\n       have the strength to politically protect themselves from wrongful\n       discrimination.    When the Supreme Court ruled that sex-based\n       classifications were subject to heightened scrutiny in 1973, the Court\n       acknowledged that women had already achieved major political victories.\n       See Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685, 93 S.Ct. 1764. The Nineteenth Amendment\n       had been ratified in 1920, and Title VII had already outlawed sex-based\n       employment. See 78 Stat. 253. The Court was persuaded nevertheless that\n       women still lacked adequate political power, in part because they were\n       “vastly underrepresented in this Nation’s decisionmaking councils,”\n       including the presidency, the Supreme Court, and the legislature.\n       Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 686 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. 1764.\n\nWindsor, 699 F.3d at 184 (citing Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S. Ct. 1764\n\n(1973)); see also Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 894 (neither “absolute political powerlessness”\n\nnor “current political powerlessness” is a prerequisite to heightened scrutiny”); Kerrigan,\n\n957 A.2d at 444 (explaining that the term “political powerlessness” is a “misnomer”; the\n\npolitical powerlessness aspect of the suspectness inquiry “does not require a showing that\n\nthe group seeking recognition as a protected class is, in fact, without political power”; the\n\nquestion, rather, is “whether the group lacks sufficient political strength to bring a prompt\n\nend to the prejudice and discrimination through traditional political means”).\n\n¶159 The Court of Appeals observed in Windsor that there are parallels between the\n\nstatus of women at the time of Frontiero and homosexuals today: their position has\n\n                                             94\n\fimproved markedly in recent decades, but they still face pervasive, although at times\n\nmore subtle, discrimination in the political arena. 699 F.3d at 184. The court noted that\n\nthe seemingly small number of acknowledged homosexuals in positions of power and\n\nauthority “is attributable either to a hostility that excludes them or to a hostility that keeps\n\ntheir sexual preference private—which, for our purposes, amounts to much the same\n\nthing.”   Windsor, 699 F.3d at 184-85.          The court further noted that these same\n\nconsiderations can also be expected “to suppress some degree of political activity by\n\ninhibiting the kind of open association that advances political agendas.” Windsor, 699\n\nF.3d at 185; see also Rowland v. Mad River Local School Dist., 470 U.S. 1009, 1014, 105\n\nS. Ct. 1373, 1377 (1985) (Brennan & Marshall, JJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari)\n\n(“Because of the immediate and severe opprobrium often manifested against\n\nhomosexuals once so identified publicly, members of this group are particularly\n\npowerless to pursue their rights openly in the political arena.”).            Thus, the court\n\nconcluded that “homosexuals are not in a position to adequately protect themselves from\n\nthe discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 185.\n\n¶160 The Connecticut Supreme Court likewise had “little difficulty in concluding that\n\ngay persons are entitled to heightened constitutional protection despite some recent\n\npolitical progress.” Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 444. The court cited several considerations in\n\nthis regard. First, the discrimination that gay persons have suffered has been so pervasive\n\nand severe—even though their sexual orientation has no bearing at all on their ability to\n\ncontribute to or perform in society—that it is highly unlikely that legislative enactments\n\nalone will suffice to eliminate that discrimination. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 444. Second,\n\n                                              95\n\finsofar as gay persons play a role in the political process, it is apparent that their numbers\n\nreflect their status as a small and insular minority. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 446. Third,\n\nalthough the state legislature eventually enacted a gay-rights law, its enactment was\n\npreceded by nearly a decade of numerous failed attempts at passage, and the legislation\n\ncontained “an unprecedented proviso” expressing the legislature’s position that it does\n\nnot condone homosexuality. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 448-50. Fourth, while the enactment\n\nof remedial legislation aimed at protecting a class from discrimination may indicate that\n\nthe subject group possesses some political power, it also supports the conclusion that the\n\nsubject group is in need of heightened constitutional protection. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n450-51; accord Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1, 28-29 (N.Y. 2006) (Kaye, C.J., &\n\nCiparick, J., dissenting) (the passage of civil rights measures “acknowledge[s]—rather\n\nthan mark[s] the end of—a history of purposeful discrimination”). Fifth, the awareness\n\nof public hatred and the fear of violence that often accompanies it undermine efforts to\n\ndevelop an effective gay political identity; gay persons are disinclined to risk retaliation\n\nby open identification with the movement, and potential allies from outside the gay and\n\nlesbian community may think twice about allying their fortunes with such a despised\n\npopulation. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 452. Sixth, gay persons lack the political power that\n\nAfrican-Americans and women possess today; yet, political gains by African-Americans\n\nand women have not been found to obviate the need for heightened judicial scrutiny of\n\nlegislation that draws distinctions on the basis of race or gender. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n453. Given all of these factors (and the detailed analysis accompanying them), the court\n\nheld that “gay persons cannot be deprived of heightened judicial protection merely\n\n                                             96\n\fbecause of their relatively limited political influence.” Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 453-54; see\n\nalso Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 895 (“gay and lesbian people are not so politically powerful\n\nas to overcome the unfair and severe prejudice that history suggests produces\n\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation”).\n\n¶161 In the present case, Dr. Chauncey provided his professional opinion that “gay and\n\nlesbian people do not currently possess a meaningful degree of political power in the\n\nUnited States or in the State of Montana.” He cites various examples reflecting the\n\npersistence of anti-gay discrimination over the last decade. The State has not refuted Dr.\n\nChauncey’s opinion or any of the evidence underlying it. I also note that the entire\n\nunderpinning of the Marriage Amendment, discussed in further detail below, was based\n\non attacking and demeaning homosexuals and homosexuality. Accordingly, in light of\n\nDr. Chauncey’s unrefuted report, the detailed discussions in the Windsor and Kerrigan\n\nopinions, and the circumstances underlying the passage of the Marriage Amendment, I\n\nconclude that gays and lesbians are not in a position to adequately protect themselves\n\nfrom the discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public.\n\n                                      5. Summary\n\n¶162 Based on the foregoing analysis under each of the factors, I conclude and would\n\nhold that sexual orientation is a suspect class under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana\n\nConstitution. Correspondingly, I would also hold that discrimination based on sexual\n\norientation in the provision of statutory benefits and protections is subject to “strict\n\nscrutiny” review. See Snetsinger, ¶ 17 (“Strict scrutiny applies if a suspect class or\n\nfundamental right is affected.”). Under the strict-scrutiny standard, the State has the\n\n                                            97\n\fburden of showing that the law or policy is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest. 8 Snetsinger, ¶ 17. I would reverse the District Court’s judgment\n\nand direct it to enter a declaratory order encompassing these holdings. But for reasons\n\ndiscussed in the Declaratory Judgment section above, I would not order injunctive relief\n\nat this time and instead would permit the legislative and executive branches to implement\n\nour constitutional interpretation in the first instance.\n\n                                     F. Human Dignity\n\n¶163 As just discussed, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory ruling that gay, lesbian,\n\nand bisexual persons are a suspect class in Montana and the State’s disparate treatment of\n\nsame-sex couples is subject to “strict scrutiny” review under the Equal Protection Clause\n\nof Article II, Section 4. This approach is sufficient to resolve this case in their favor.\n\n¶164 That said, however, it is equally important to acknowledge the more fundamental\n\nhuman issue in this case. In addition to guaranteeing “the equal protection of the laws,”\n\nArticle II, Section 4 also provides that “[t]he dignity of the human being is inviolable.” I\n\naddressed this provision of Montana’s Constitution at length in Baxter v. State, 2009 MT\n\n449, ¶¶ 74-94, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211 (Nelson, J., specially concurring). In the\n\ninterests of brevity, given that this is already a lengthy dissent, I am not going to repeat\n\nmy entire analysis and discussion of the Dignity Clause here.\n\n\n\n       8\n         The State has put forth one purported objective for the exclusion of same-sex\ncouples from the statutory benefits and obligations provided to married couples: “that an\noption short of marriage would detract from or dilute the uniqueness of the marital bond.”\nFor reasons discussed in the Marriage Amendment section below, I conclude that this\nasserted justification is without merit. See ¶¶ 174-178, 186-187, 204-205, infra.\n                                               98\n\f¶165 Suffice it to say that, as I stated in Baxter, human dignity is perhaps the most\n\nfundamental right in the Declaration of Rights. Indeed, it is the only right in Montana’s\n\nConstitution that is “inviolable”—meaning that it is absolute. No individual may be\n\nstripped of his or her human dignity by the government or by a private organization.\n\nBaxter, ¶ 83 (Nelson, J., specially concurring).\n\n¶166 Human dignity may be defined in many ways. But, at bottom, it encompasses a\n\nfundament truth: every individual person is intrinsically valuable and has inherent worth\n\nbecause we are sentient beings with the capacity of independent, autonomous, rational,\n\nand responsible thought and action. Baxter, ¶ 84 (Nelson, J., specially concurring).\n\nDemonizing, demeaning, degrading, and stereotyping people because of their sexual\n\norientation is simply an attempt to strip those so condemned of their worth, their value,\n\nand hence their dignity. Indeed, naming it for what it is, discrimination based on sexual\n\norientation is bigotry. And, whether rationalized on the basis of majoritarian morality,\n\npartisan ideology, or religious tenets, homophobic discrimination is still bigotry. Kulstad\n\nv. Maniaci, 2009 MT 326, ¶ 103, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595 (Nelson, J., concurring).\n\n¶167 Without belaboring the point, the State’s treatment of the committed couples here\n\nbased on their sexual orientation is a frontal assault on their dignity as autonomous,\n\nrational, independent human beings. The State’s public censure effectively conveys to\n\nthese citizens the message that, as a class, they are inferior, immoral, corrupt, perverted,\n\nand sinful—that they are not worthy of sharing in the advantages that the State provides\n\nto their “normal,” family-oriented, God-fearing, and morally superior heterosexual\n\ncounterparts. “[T]he failure to provide equal benefits and protections in Montana law to\n\n                                             99\n\fsame-sex couples [is] a failure to respect the core humanity of gay and lesbian couples by\n\ndenying that they can create, for themselves, the same sort of committed, loving\n\nrelationships which heterosexual couples can create.” Matthew O. Clifford and Thomas\n\nP. Huff, Some Thoughts on the Meaning and Scope of the Montana Constitution’s\n\n“Dignity” Clause with Possible Applications, 61 Mont. L. Rev. 301, 335 n. 137 (2000). I\n\ncan think of no better way to attack the right of inviolable human dignity of each of the\n\nPlaintiffs in this case. I conclude and would hold that the State’s discriminatory refusal\n\nto provide the benefits and protections at issue here to the committed intimate same-sex\n\ncouples violates the Dignity Clause of Article II, Section 4.\n\n¶168 Having concluded my analysis under the Equal Protection and Dignity Clauses, I\n\nnow turn to the Marriage Amendment.\n\n                         V. THE MARRIAGE AMENDMENT\n\n¶169          Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely\n              between man and his God, that he owes account to none other\n              for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of\n              government reach actions only, and not opinions, I\n              contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole\n              American people which declared that their legislature should\n              ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\n              prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of\n              separation between church and State. 9\n\n                              A. Constitutional Language\n\n¶170 The Montana Constitution is divided into 14 articles, each addressing a different\n\nfacet of government. Article I contains the Compact with the United States. Article II is\n\n\n       9\n        Letter to the Danbury, Conn., Baptist Assn. (Jan. 1, 1802), in Works of Thomas\nJefferson vol. 8, 113.\n                                            100\n\fthe Declaration of Rights—which we have described as “a compact of overlapping and\n\nredundant rights and guarantees,” Armstrong v. State, 296 Mont. 361, 389, 989 P.2d 364,\n\n383 (1999), each of which is “fundamental,” Kortum-Managhan v. Herbergers NBGL,\n\n2009 MT 79, ¶ 25, 349 Mont. 475, 204 P.3d 693. They include the rights to privacy, due\n\nprocess, human dignity, religion, and equal protection of the laws, to name but a few.\n\nArticle III enumerates general governmental provisions, such as separation of powers, the\n\noath of office, and the powers of initiative and referendum. Article IV concerns suffrage\n\nand elections. Articles V, VI, and VII set forth the powers of the Legislature, the\n\nExecutive, and the Judiciary, respectively. Article VIII concerns revenue and finance;\n\nArticle IX the environment and natural resources; Article X education and public lands;\n\nArticle XI local government; Article XII departments and institutions; and Article XIV\n\nconstitutional revision and amendment.\n\n¶171 That leaves Article XIII, which is titled “General Provisions.” Section 1 concerns\n\nthe chartering of nonmunicipal corporations. Section 2 directs the Legislature to provide\n\nfor an office of consumer counsel. Section 3 (repealed in 1986) required the Legislature\n\nto create a salary commission. Section 4 directs the Legislature to adopt a code of ethics.\n\nSection 5 requires the Legislature to enact liberal homestead and exemption laws. And\n\nSection 6 prohibits perpetuities except for charitable purposes.\n\n¶172 Last among these general provisions is Section 7, the Marriage Amendment,\n\nwhich was added in 2004. It states, in its entirety: “Only a marriage between one man\n\nand one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.” Mont. Const.\n\nart. XIII, § 7. I note that this is the only provision in the Montana Constitution that\n\n                                            101\n\fpurports to affirmatively strip an entire class of citizens of an elemental civil right\n\naccorded, presumptively and without thought or hesitation, to all other Montanans.\n\n                     B. Irrelevance of the Marriage Amendment\n\n¶173 The State and several of its amici drape themselves in the mantel of the Marriage\n\nAmendment as an underpinning for their arguments. They argue that granting committed\n\nintimate same-sex couples any of the statutory benefits and protections which are\n\naccorded to different-sex married couples—while still denying same-sex couples the right\n\nto marry—may violate the Marriage Amendment. I say “may” because, as noted earlier,\n\nthe Attorney General’s position is difficult to reconcile. On one hand, he seems to\n\ncontend that the Marriage Amendment precludes Plaintiffs’ claims, yet, on the other\n\nhand, he concedes that the Legislature could provide same-sex couples with similar\n\nprotections as are granted to different-sex married couples, by means of a civil-union or\n\ndomestic-partnership scheme, if it chose to do so. See ¶ 63, supra. Regardless of the\n\nState’s actual position on this matter, however, there is no question where the State’s\n\namici stand: They believe that the Marriage Amendment precludes Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\nSee Amicus Curiae Br. of Mont. Catholic Conf. and Other Christian Churches at 5 (“This\n\nlawsuit is, in effect, an attempt to change the Constitutional and statutory definition of\n\nmarriage.”); Br. of Amicus Curiae Mont. Family Found. at 3 (“Th[e] constitutional\n\ndefinition of marriage is, in reality, what Appellants challenge . . . .”); Br. of Amici\n\nCuriae Sen. President, Sen. Majority Leader, Speaker of the H.R., and H. Majority\n\nLeader of the State of Montana at 7-13 (analogizing the issue here, concerning same-sex\n\ncouples, to the “moral dilemma” in the mid-1800s of whether slavery was “right” or\n\n                                           102\n\f“wrong,” and arguing that this Court should not “exalt the desires of the minority” over\n\nthe will of the majority expressed through Montana’s Marriage Amendment). Needless\n\nto say, I disagree entirely with this view of the Marriage Amendment’s scope.\n\n¶174 First of all, Plaintiffs do not seek the status of “marriage.” They seek only the\n\nopportunity to obtain the protections which the State of Montana has made available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples—such as decision-making authority during medical emergencies\n\nand end-of-life situations, a financial safety net under the tax code, and legal rights in the\n\nevent of a spouse’s injury, death, or intestacy. In the most basic terms, these committed\n\nintimate same-sex couples—some of whom have been together for decades—merely ask\n\nthat they not be treated as “legal strangers” to each other. It is difficult to comprehend\n\nhow granting them this basic civil right infringes upon or undermines the institution of\n\nmarriage, or threatens the rights of different-sex couples.\n\n¶175 Indeed, the same sort of paranoid arguments were once held out as obvious and\n\nincontrovertible reasons to deny the constitutional rights of different-race couples. See\n\ne.g. Perez v. Sharp, 198 P.2d 17, 23 (Cal. 1948) (“[R]espondent has sought to justify the\n\nstatute by contending that the prohibition of intermarriage between Caucasians and\n\nmembers of the specified races prevents the Caucasian race from being contaminated by\n\nraces whose members are by nature physically and mentally inferior to Caucasians.”);\n\nScott v. State, 39 Ga. 321, 323 (1869) (“The amalgamation of the races is not only\n\nunnatural, but is always productive of deplorable results. Our daily observation shows\n\nus, that the offspring of these unnatural connections are generally sickly and effeminate,\n\nand that they are inferior in physical development and strength, to the fullblood of either\n\n                                             103\n\frace. It is sometimes urged that such marriages should be encouraged, for the purpose of\n\nelevating the inferior race. The reply is, that such connections never elevate the inferior\n\nrace to the position of the superior, but they bring down the superior to that of the\n\ninferior. They are productive of evil, and evil only, without any corresponding good.”);\n\nState v. Gibson, 36 Ind. 389, 405 (1871) (requiring separation of the races “ ‘is not\n\nprejudice, nor caste, nor injustice of any kind, but simply to suffer men to follow the law\n\nof races established by the Creator himself, and not to compel them to intermix contrary\n\nto their instincts’ ” (quoting W. Chester & Phila. R.R. Co. v. Miles, 55 Pa. 209, 214\n\n(1867)); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 3, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 1819 (1967) (“ ‘Almighty God\n\ncreated the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate\n\ncontinents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause\n\nfor [interracial] marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not\n\nintend for the races to mix.’ ” (quoting the trial judge’s decision)). As we now recognize,\n\nthese supposedly self-evident propositions are, in fact, utterly groundless. Upholding the\n\nrights of different-race couples did not impinge on the institution of marriage or deprive it\n\nof its vitality, and neither will upholding the rights of the same-sex couples here, who do\n\nnot even ask to be “married” in the first place.\n\n¶176 Secondly, “[t]hat the Marriage Amendment effectively prevents same-sex couples\n\nfrom marrying does not automatically permit the government to treat them differently in\n\nother ways.” Alaska Civ. Liberties Union v. State, 122 P.3d 781, 786-87 (Alaska 2005).\n\nIndeed, the plain language of the Marriage Amendment neither requires the State to\n\nconfer any specific benefits or obligations on married persons, nor prohibits the State\n\n                                             104\n\ffrom granting the same protections to unmarried persons that it grants to married persons.\n\nThis fact is reflected throughout the Montana Code. For example, the right of a spouse to\n\nbe appointed as guardian of an incapacitated person is not exclusive to the spouse. The\n\nright is also shared by “a relative or friend who has demonstrated a sincere, longstanding\n\ninterest in the welfare of the incapacitated person.” Section 72-5-312, MCA. Likewise,\n\nthe partner-or-family-member-assault statute protects not only spouses, but also “persons\n\nwho have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate relationship with a person\n\nof the opposite sex.” Section 45-5-206, MCA. Other examples exist, but the point is that\n\nthese illustrations demonstrate, unequivocally, that there is no merit to the premise that\n\nthe Marriage Amendment bars the State from granting unmarried persons the same rights\n\nand protections that the State grants to married persons. Neither the State nor any of its\n\namici cite any authority for such a proposition.\n\n¶177 In fact, the State’s reasoning on this point is entirely circular. The State offers the\n\nfollowing syllogism: Premise 1 – “Marriage is defined by [§ 40-1-103, MCA] as ‘a\n\npersonal relationship between a man and a woman arising out of a civil contract to which\n\nthe consent of the parties is essential’ ”; Premise 2 – This definition “has been\n\nincorporated into the Montana Constitution by [the Marriage Amendment]”;\n\nConclusion – “Spousal benefits, therefore, flow from the now-constitutional status of\n\nmarriage.” All that Premise 1 and Premise 2 establish, however, is that the “personal\n\nrelationship” recognized by the State must, under the Montana Constitution, consist of\n\none man and one woman. The third (unstated) premise of the State’s syllogism is that\n\nthis “personal relationship” includes the right to “spousal benefits.” Yet, neither the\n\n                                            105\n\fMarriage Amendment nor § 40-1-103, MCA, says anything about spousal benefits, and\n\nthe State concedes elsewhere in its brief that there is “no constitutional or judicially\n\nenforceable mandate for the Legislature to provide or fund spousal benefits.” See In re\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 426 (Cal. 2008) (“the constitutional right to marry clearly\n\ndoes not obligate the state to afford specific tax or other governmental benefits on the\n\nbasis of a couple’s family relationship”). So, if the Legislature is not mandated to\n\nprovide or fund spousal benefits, then obviously such benefits are not implicit in the\n\n“personal relationship” identified in § 40-1-103, MCA. Indeed, to hold otherwise could\n\ngive rise to innumerable Takings and Due Process claims every time the Legislature\n\nreduced or eliminated a spousal benefit. As Plaintiffs point out, and as the State tacitly\n\nadmits, the Legislature’s conferral of such benefits is entirely “discretionary.”\n\nApparently the point the State is attempting to make is that when the State does choose to\n\ngrant a benefit to married persons, the benefit cannot be granted to anyone else (i.e., to\n\nunmarried persons). But that is clearly not true, given the various statutes, noted above,\n\nwhich grant the same benefits to non-spouses as they do spouses.\n\n¶178 Notably, the California Supreme Court concluded that Proposition 8, which\n\namended California’s Constitution to restrict marriage to one man and one woman, did\n\nnot also “have the effect of abrogating the constitutional right of same-sex couples to\n\nenter into an officially recognized family relationship with a designation other than\n\nmarriage.” Strauss v. Horton, 207 P.3d 48, 77 (Cal. 2009). The court noted that\n\n      an alternative, much more sweeping initiative measure—proposing the\n      addition of a new constitutional section that would have provided not only\n      that “[o]nly marriage between one man and one woman is valid or\n\n                                           106\n\f       recognized in California,” but also that “[n]either the Legislature nor any\n       court, government institution, government agency, initiative statute, local\n       government, or government official shall . . . bestow statutory rights,\n       incidents, or employee benefits of marriage on unmarried individuals”—\n       was circulated for signature at the same time as Proposition 8, but did not\n       obtain sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.\n\nStrauss, 207 P.3d at 76 n. 8 (brackets and ellipsis in original). In Nebraska, voters did\n\npass a more sweeping measure of this sort in November 2000. As a result, Nebraska’s\n\nConstitution now states: “Only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid or\n\nrecognized in Nebraska. The uniting of two persons of the same sex in a civil union,\n\ndomestic partnership, or other similar same-sex relationship shall not be valid or\n\nrecognized in Nebraska.” Neb. Const. art. I, § 29 (emphasis added). If the additional\n\nlanguage contained in Nebraska’s Marriage Amendment and in the failed alternative to\n\nCalifornia’s Proposition 8 were part of Montana’s Marriage Amendment, the State’s and\n\nits amici’s arguments here might have traction. But that is not the case, and it is not the\n\nprerogative of the State, its amici, or this Court to insert such language. Section 1-2-101,\n\nMCA; Jud. Stands. Commn. v. Not Afraid, 2010 MT 285, ¶ 15, 358 Mont. 532, 245 P.3d\n\n1116. By its plain terms, Montana’s Marriage Amendment applies to “marriage.” It says\n\nnothing about civil unions, domestic partnerships, or other similar same-sex relationships.\n\nIt does not say that the government cannot bestow statutory rights, incidents, or employee\n\nbenefits of marriage on unmarried individuals. As the State concedes, the Legislature\n\ncould enact a civil-union or domestic-partnership scheme if it chose to do so.\n\n¶179   Accordingly, there was no need for the Attorney General to inject the Marriage\n\nAmendment into this case, nor was there any legal basis for the religious and “family\n\n\n                                            107\n\fvalues” organizations to file numerous amicus briefs supporting the Attorney General’s\n\narguments in that respect. Nevertheless, the Marriage Amendment has been put at issue,\n\nand it is thus necessary to address this aspect of the State’s approach. For the reasons\n\nwhich follow, and based on my examination of the provision for what it actually is and\n\ndoes, I conclude the Marriage Amendment itself cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n                         C. Basis of the Marriage Amendment\n\n¶180 The entire underpinning of the Marriage Amendment is based on attacking and\n\ndemeaning homosexuals and homosexuality. This is abundantly clear from the 2004\n\nVoter Information Pamphlet provided to voters by the Montana Secretary of State and\n\ncontained in the record of this case. In their argument for the Marriage Amendment\n\n(referred to as Constitutional Initiative 96 or CI-96), Proponents rail against “homosexual\n\nactivists” who, Proponents claim, are seeking out “activist judges” to force Montanans to\n\nbecome part of “a vast, untested social experiment.” Proponents assert that “homosexual\n\nactivists” are “threatening” not only “the time-honored, vital institution of marriage,” but\n\nalso “the freedom to teach our children as we wish.” Proponents warn parents that if\n\nCI-96 fails, “[e]very public school in Montana would be required to teach your children\n\nthat same-sex marriage and homosexuality are perfectly normal” (emphasis in original).\n\nProponents use similar scare tactics in an attempt to rally “small business employers,”\n\nasserting that they “may someday be required to provide expanded health coverage,\n\nretirement and fringe benefits to same-sex ‘spouses’ of employees” (emphasis in\n\noriginal), which allegedly “could hurt Montana’s economy and jobs.” Proponents also\n\nwarn churchgoers that if CI-96 does not pass, “[y]our church will be legally pressured to\n\n                                            108\n\fperform same-sex weddings” and may lose its “tax exemptions” if it refuses to perform\n\nsuch ceremonies. Finally, Proponents argue that CI-96 is necessary for childrearing:\n\n       Natural marriage is extremely important for future generations. Men and\n       women are distinctly different. Each gender brings vitally important, and\n       unique, elements to a child’s development. Saying that children don’t\n       necessarily need fathers or mothers is saying that one gender or the other\n       is unnecessary.      A loving and compassionate society always aids\n       motherless and fatherless families.       Compassionate societies never\n       intentionally create families without mothers or fathers, which is exactly\n       what same-sex homes do. [Emphasis in original.]\n\n¶181 Notably, in their rebuttal to the opponents’ argument against CI-96, Proponents\n\nstate that the initiative “doesn’t limit the ability of homosexuals to enter into contractual\n\nagreements to protect their assets,” “doesn’t stop employers from giving same-sex\n\ncouples the same benefits as their married employees (if they so choose),” and “doesn’t\n\nstop churches from recognizing same-sex relationships.” Proponents categorically deny\n\nthat the Marriage Amendment “limits the rights of homosexuals.” They state that the\n\nMarriage Amendment accomplishes one thing:           “It simply stops the legalization of\n\nhomosexual marriage,” which Proponents claim has never been a “right” of same-sex\n\ncouples in the first place. Proponents make it clear that their goal is to preserve “the\n\nhistorical definition of marriage.” Proponents present no argument that the Marriage\n\nAmendment will go further and prohibit state government from granting same-sex\n\ncouples legal protections similar to those possessed by married persons. Proponents did\n\nnot incorporate into Montana’s Marriage Amendment the language used in Article I,\n\nSection 29 of the Nebraska Constitution, which had been approved by Nebraska electors\n\nseveral years earlier (in November 2000).\n\n\n                                            109\n\f¶182 In any event, the important point here is that there is no factual or legal basis\n\nwhatsoever for any of Proponents’ assertions in support of CI-96. Indeed, the Voter\n\nInformation Pamphlet offers no actual reasoning, statistics, or evidence to support the\n\nfears it mongers. Yet, the fabricated threats posed by homosexuals to marriage, family,\n\nchildren, business, religion, and the economy were the so-called “official” justifications\n\nfor the Marriage Amendment. It is clear that the promoters of the Marriage Amendment\n\nwere playing to a populist paranoia grounded in something other than actual evidence.\n\n¶183 In this regard, some useful insights may be gleaned from the strikingly similar\n\ncampaign four years later (in 2008) in support of Proposition 8 in California. Essentially\n\nidentical to Montana’s Marriage Amendment, Proposition 8 (now Article I, Section 7.5 of\n\nthe California Constitution) states in its entirety: “Only marriage between a man and a\n\nwoman is valid or recognized in California.” Following its approval by a slim majority\n\nof California voters (52.3 percent), Proposition 8 was challenged in federal court. In\n\nJanuary 2010, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California held\n\na 12-day bench trial, during which it heard testimony from 8 lay witnesses and 11 expert\n\nwitnesses.     The federal district court then entered extensive findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, ultimately deciding that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional under both\n\nthe Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704\n\nF. Supp. 2d 921 (N.D. Cal. 2010), aff’d sub nom. Perry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir.\n\n2012).       Because the proponents of Proposition 8 “vigorously” defended the\n\nconstitutionality of California’s Marriage Amendment, Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 931,\n\nand because a substantial evidentiary record was created concerning the alleged need for\n\n                                           110\n\fa prohibition against same-sex marriage, the Perry case provides valuable context and\n\ninsights for my discussion of Montana’s Marriage Amendment. I shall detail, therefore,\n\nthe pertinent parts of the Perry decision here.\n\n¶184 For starters, the federal district court found that the proponents of Proposition 8\n\nrelied “on fears that children exposed to the concept of same-sex marriage may become\n\ngay or lesbian” and “on stereotypes to show that same-sex relationships are inferior to\n\nopposite-sex relationships.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 988, 990. Indeed, the proponents\n\nadmitted as much:\n\n       “[P]assing Proposition 8 would depend on our ability to convince voters\n       that same-sex marriage had broader implications for Californians and was\n       not only about the two individuals involved in a committed gay\n       relationship.” “We strongly believed that a campaign in favor of traditional\n       marriage would not be enough to prevail.” “We probed long and hard in\n       countless focus groups and surveys to explore reactions to a variety of\n       consequences our issue experts identified” and they decided to create\n       campaign messaging focusing on “how this new ‘fundamental right’ would\n       be inculcated in young children through public schools.” “[T]here were\n       limits to the degree of tolerance Californians would afford the gay\n       community. They would entertain allowing gay marriage, but not if doing\n       so had significant implications for the rest of society.” “The Prop 8 victory\n       proves something that readers of Politics magazine know very well:\n       campaigns matter.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 988 (brackets in original) (quoting Frank Schubert & Jeff Flint,\n\nPassing Prop 8, Politics, Feb. 2009, at 45-47).\n\n¶185 Similar to the ballot argument for Montana’s Marriage Amendment, the ballot\n\nargument in support of Proposition 8 summarized the initiative as follows:\n\n       Proposition 8 is simple and straightforward. * * * Proposition 8 is about\n       preserving marriage; it’s not an attack on the gay lifestyle. * * * It protects\n       our children from being taught in public schools that “same-sex marriage”\n       is the same as traditional marriage. * * * While death, divorce, or other\n\n                                            111\n\f       circumstances may prevent the ideal, the best situation for a child is to be\n       raised by a married mother and father. * * * If the gay marriage ruling [of\n       the California Supreme Court] is not overturned, TEACHERS COULD BE\n       REQUIRED to teach young children there is no difference between gay\n       marriage and traditional marriage.\n\n       We should not accept a court decision that may result in public schools\n       teaching our own kids that gay marriage is ok. * * * [W]hile gays have the\n       right to their private lives, they do not have the right to redefine marriage\n       for everyone else.\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 930 (brackets and asterisks in original, internal quotation marks\n\nomitted) (quoting California Voter Information Guide, California General Election,\n\nTuesday, November 4, 2008). In a mailing leaflet, the Proposition 8 proponents accused\n\nthe California Supreme Court of being “activist” when it decreed earlier that year that\n\ngays and lesbians have the same fundamental right as heterosexuals to marry. See Perry,\n\n704 F. Supp. 2d at 988-89; Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 433-34 (“[W]e conclude that the\n\nright to marry . . . guarantees same-sex couples the same substantive constitutional rights\n\nas opposite-sex couples to choose one’s life partner and enter with that person into a\n\ncommitted, officially recognized, and protected family relationship that enjoys all of the\n\nconstitutionally based incidents of marriage.”). The Proposition 8 proponents argued that\n\n“ ‘[i]f traditional marriage goes by the wayside, then in every public school, children will\n\nbe indoctrinated with a message that is absolutely contrary to the values that their family\n\nis attempting to teach them at home.’ ” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 990. They suggested to\n\nvoters that “ ‘the fact that gay people are being asked to be recognized and have their\n\nrelationships recognized is an imposition on other people, as opposed to an extension of\n\nfundamental civil rights to gay and lesbian people.’ ” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 989.\n\n\n                                            112\n\fLike the proponents of Montana’s Marriage Amendment, the Proposition 8 proponents\n\n“focused on protecting children and the concern that people of faith and religious groups\n\nwould somehow be harmed by the recognition of gay marriage.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 990.   “The campaign conveyed a message that gay people and relationships are\n\ninferior, that homosexuality is undesirable and that children need to be protected from\n\nexposure to gay people and their relationships.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 990.\n\n¶186 Based on the evidence regarding the campaign to pass Proposition 8, the federal\n\ndistrict court concluded that “the most likely explanation for its passage [was] a desire to\n\nadvance the belief that opposite-sex couples are morally superior to same-sex couples.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1002-03. The court further observed, however, that none of the\n\nevidence supported the proponents’ premise that opposite-sex relationships are materially\n\ndistinct from same-sex relationships. To the contrary, “the evidence thoroughly rebutted\n\n[that premise]: rather than being different, same-sex and opposite-sex unions are, for all\n\npurposes relevant to California law, exactly the same.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1001.\n\nFurthermore, and contrary to the unsubstantiated fears asserted by the State’s amici in the\n\npresent case, the federal district court found that “[p]ermitting same-sex couples to marry\n\nwill not affect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have\n\nchildren outside of marriage or otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex marriages.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 972. In regard to these findings, the court pointed to extensive\n\nexpert testimony and other evidence in the record, plus various admissions by the\n\nProposition 8 proponents, highlights of which I shall note here:\n\n\n\n                                            113\n\f• “Gay and lesbian sexual orientations are ‘normal variation[s] and are considered\n  to be aspects of well-adjusted behavior.’ ”\n\n• “Homosexuality is not considered a mental disorder. The American Psychiatric\n  Association, the American Psychological Association and other major\n  professional mental health associations have all gone on record affirming that\n  homosexuality is a normal expression of sexuality and that it is not in any way a\n  form of pathology.”\n\n• “ ‘Courts and legal scholars have concluded that sexual orientation is not related\n  to an individual’s ability to contribute to society or perform in the workplace.’ ”\n\n• “Proponents admit that same-sex sexual orientation does not result in any\n  impairment in judgment or general social and vocational capabilities.”\n\n• “Proponents admit that gay and lesbian individuals, including plaintiffs, have\n  formed lasting, committed and caring relationships with persons of the same sex\n  and same-sex couples share their lives and participate in their communities\n  together.”\n\n• The American Psychoanalytic Association has stated that “ ‘gay men and\n  lesbians possess the same potential and desire for sustained loving and lasting\n  relationships as heterosexuals.’ ”\n\n• “Research that has compared the quality of same-sex and opposite-sex\n  relationships and the processes that affect those relationships consistently shows\n  ‘great similarity across couples, both same-sex and heterosexual.’ ”\n\n• “Same-sex couples have more similarities than differences with opposite-sex\n  couples, and any differences are marginal.”\n\n• “Married same-sex couples in Massachusetts have reported various benefits from\n  marriage including greater commitment to the relationship, more acceptance\n  from extended family, less worry over legal problems, greater access to health\n  benefits and benefits for their children.”\n\n• “Proponents admit that gay and lesbian individuals raise children together.”\n\n• “ ‘[S]ocial science has shown that the concerns often raised about children of\n  lesbian and gay parents—concerns that are generally grounded in prejudice\n  against and stereotypes about gay people—are unfounded.’ ”\n\n\n\n                                     114\n\f       • “Studies have demonstrated ‘very conclusively that children who are raised by\n         gay and lesbian parents are just as likely to be well-adjusted as children raised by\n         heterosexual parents.’ These results are ‘completely consistent with our broader\n         understanding of the factors that affect children’s adjustment.’ ”\n\n       • “Sociological and psychological peer-reviewed studies conclude that permitting\n         gay and lesbian individuals to marry does not cause any problems for children.”\n\n       • “Children do not need to be raised by a male parent and a female parent to be\n         well-adjusted, and having both a male and a female parent does not increase the\n         likelihood that a child will be well-adjusted.”\n\n       • “The genetic relationship between a parent and a child is not related to a child’s\n         adjustment outcomes.”\n\n       • “Allowing same-sex couples to marry will have ‘no impact’ on the stability of\n         marriage.”\n\n       • “When racial restrictions on marriage across color lines were abolished, there\n         was alarm and many people worried that the institution of marriage would be\n         degraded and devalued. But ‘there has been no evidence that the institution of\n         marriage has become less popular because * * * people can marry whoever they\n         want.’ ”\n\n       • “Data from Massachusetts on the ‘annual rates for marriage and for divorce’ for\n         ‘the four years prior to same-sex marriage being legal and the four years after’\n         show ‘that the rates of marriage and divorce are no different after [same-sex]\n         marriage was permitted than they were before.’ ”\n\n       • “The viability of civilization or social order does not depend upon marriage as an\n         exclusively heterosexual institution.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 961, 967-69, 972-73, 980-81.\n\n¶187 In sum, like the CI-96 campaign, the Proposition 8 campaign “relied heavily on\n\nnegative stereotypes about gays and lesbians.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1003. But\n\nwhen asked to demonstrate the validity of their arguments in court, the proponents failed\n\nto produce any actual evidence substantiating the notion that same-sex marriage harms\n\nchildren, is inferior to different-sex marriage, or threatens the stability of different-sex\n\n                                            115\n\fmarriage. More to the point, the challengers did produce substantial evidence—including\n\ndeposition testimony by two of the proponents’ own witnesses—refuting each of these\n\npropositions. In the end, it became apparent to the federal district court that “moral and\n\nreligious views form the only basis for a belief that same-sex couples are different from\n\nopposite-sex couples.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1001 (emphases added).\n\n¶188 One such underlying moral and religious view is that men and women must adhere\n\nto specific gender roles in a marriage: the husband “is the bread winner” and the wife\n\n“stays at home.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 958-59, 975, 998. That is no longer the law\n\nin California or Montana, however. See Cal. Fam. Code § 720; § 40-2-101, MCA.\n\n       “[T]he primacy of the husband as the legal and economic representative of\n       the couple, and the protector and provider for his wife, was seen as\n       absolutely essential to what marriage was” in the nineteenth century.\n       Gender restrictions were slowly removed from marriage, but “because there\n       were such alarms about it and such resistance to change in this what had\n       been seen as quite an essential characteristic of marriage, it took a very very\n       long time before this trajectory of the removal of the state from prescribing\n       these rigid spousal roles was complete.” The removal of gender inequality\n       in marriage is now complete “to no apparent damage to the institution.\n       And, in fact, I think to the benefit of the institution.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 960 (brackets in original) (quoting trial testimony).\n\n¶189 Another underlying moral and religious view is that gay and lesbian relationships\n\nare sinful. Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 985-86. In this regard, one witness pointed out that\n\n       [t]he religious arguments that were mobilized in the 1950s to argue against\n       interracial marriage and integration as against God’s will are mirrored by\n       arguments that have been mobilized in the Proposition 8 campaign and\n       many of the campaigns since Anita Bryant’s ‘Save Our Children’\n       campaign, which argue that homosexuality itself or gay people or the\n       recognition of their equality is against God’s will.\n\n\n\n                                            116\n\fPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 985. 10 And this leads me to the crux of the matter: that\n\nMontana’s Marriage Amendment is an unconstitutional attempt to enforce a sectarian\n\nbelief (held by some 11) through Montana’s secular law.\n\n¶190 Indeed, the Marriage Amendment is undisputedly grounded in religious doctrine.\n\nThat much is apparent not only from the federal district court’s findings, but particularly\n\nfrom the fulminations of numerous religious organizations in the present case, led by the\n\nMontana Catholic Conference, against the prospect that gay, lesbian, and bisexual\n\nMontanans might enjoy some measure of legal protection for their relationships. If\n\nhomosexuality and same-sex relationships were not a religious issue, it is highly doubtful\n\nthat any of these amici would be so actively involved in this case. 12\n\n\n       10\n           See also e.g. Alan Sears & Craig Osten, The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the\nPrincipal Threat to Religious Freedom Today (Broadman & Holman 2003). It is\ndisturbing that the same sort of propaganda was used to demonize various disliked groups\nin pre-World War II Germany. Some examples of this are provided at the German\nPropaganda Archive, http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa, including The German\nNational Catechism, The Jewish World Plague, and Ten Responses to Jewish Lackeys.\nSee also Persecution of Homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust,\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany_and_the_H\nolocaust (which is a thorough and authoritatively supported article on the subject); Jewish\nVirtual Library, Nazi Persecution of the Mentally and Physically Disabled,\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/disabled.html. (Each Internet site\nmentioned in this Dissent was last accessed December 14, 2012.)\n        11\n           As amici curiae Montana Religious Leaders make clear, religious organizations\nare not in unanimous agreement concerning the rights of same-sex couples. Compare\nAmicus Curiae Br. of Mont. Catholic Conf. and Other Christian Churches (opposing\nPlaintiffs’ claim), with Br. of Amici Curiae “Montana Religious Leaders” (supporting\nPlaintiffs’ claim because, “like all Montanans, gay and lesbian Montanans deserve to be\ntreated with dignity and afforded equal rights and protections under the law”).\n        12\n           As a former member of the Catholic Church, I find it somewhat incongruous\nthat while the Montana Catholic Conference leads the charge here against the same-sex\ncouples, the Church is an institution that is itself burdened with a history of marginalizing\nwomen and facilitating the sexual abuse of children. The literature on this subject is\n                                            117\n\f¶191 Before proceeding, I should note that what follows is not an attack on religion, and\n\nI make no pretense of being a theologian. That the Marriage Amendment embodies a\n\nbiblical abhorrence of homosexuality is, in my view, apparent from the testimony and\n\nevidence in the Perry case, discussed above, and from a casual reading of the Bible’s\n\nteachings against homosexuality, discussed below.\n\n¶192 While the historical Jesus, notably, had absolutely nothing to say on the subject,\n\nthere are passing references to homosexuality in Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10,\n\nprodigious, and I make no attempt to cite all of it here. The following resources confirm\nmy observations in this regard: The City University of New York, John Jay College of\nCriminal Justice, The Nature and Scope of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests\nand Deacons in the United States 1950-2002 (Feb. 2004), http://www.bishop-\naccountability.org/reports/2004_02_27_JohnJay_revised/2004_02_27_John_Jay_Main_R\neport_Optimized.pdf; Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine\nHuman Values, 199-201 n. 14 (Free Press 2010); Catholic Sex Abuse Cases,\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases (a thoroughly annotated article on\nthe subject); Sandra M.

Times (Apr. 5,\n2012); Doctrinal Assessment of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious,\nhttp://www.usccb.org/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=55544.\n        In a similar vein, while officially condemning homosexuality, the Boy Scouts of\nAmerica, a federally chartered organization, incongruously maintained a different\napproach in dealing with pedophile adult scout leaders and volunteers. For decades, the\norganization maintained secret “perversion files,” failed to report incidents of child\nsexual abuse to legal authorities, covered up sexual abuse reports, handled sexual abuse\nclaims “in house” via face-saving measures, and facilitated the sexual abuse of children\nby allowing pedophiles excluded from the scouting program in one state to reenter the\nprogram in a different state (not unlike the approach of the Catholic Church, as noted\nabove. See Petula Dvorak, In Boy Scouts’ “Perversion Files,” Vivid Details on the Child\nMolesters among Us, Washington Post (Oct. 26, 2012); Paul Duggan, Boy Scout\n“Perversion Files” Released, Washington Post (Oct. 18, 2012); Bob Rogers, Montana\nand Wyoming Men Identified in Boy Scouts’ “Perversion File,” Billings Gazette (Oct.\n18, 2012); PRWeb, Monumental Boy Scouts Child Sex Abuse Report Released,\nhttp://www.prweb.com/releases/prwebboy-scouts/child-sex-abuse/prweb10134925.htm\n(Nov. 15, 2012).\n                                          118\n\fI Timothy 1:10, and Jude 1:7 (New King James Version). The primary condemnations of\n\nhomosexuality, however, are taken from the Genesis story of Sodom and Gomorrah, and\n\nfrom the rules set out in Leviticus. In the former, God sends two angles in the form of\n\nmen to the home of Lot to warn him of God’s impending punishment of the townspeople.\n\nThe Sodomites surround Lot’s house demanding to “know” (i.e., have carnal knowledge\n\nof) the two men. Lot declines and, instead, offers up his two daughters to the mob. But\n\nwhen that ploy fails, the angels strike the townsmen blind. Lot, his wife Sarah, and his\n\ntwo daughters then flee the city. Along the way, Sarah is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot\n\neventually takes up residence in a cave with his two daughters, where he gets drunk and\n\nimpregnates them both.      Genesis 19:1-36.       Many believe this story reflects God’s\n\ncondemnation of homosexuality, and they thus equate “Sodomite” with “homosexual.” I\n\nnote, though, that in Ezekiel 16:49-50, the sins of Sodom are identified as pride, gluttony,\n\nsloth, greed, arrogance, and failure to help the poor.\n\n¶193 The references to homosexuality in Leviticus are part of the so-called “Holiness\n\nCode.”       See   Luther    Seminary,     Leviticus     17-27   –   The   Holiness   Code,\n\nhttp://www.enterthebible.org/resourcelink.aspx?rid=377. Leviticus explicitly condemns\n\nhomosexuality: “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.”\n\nLeviticus, 18:22; see also Leviticus, 20:13 (“If a man lies with a male as he lies with a\n\nwoman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death.\n\nTheir blood shall be upon them.”). It should also be noted, however, that Leviticus sets\n\nforth a number of other rules that presumably made sense to a primitive nomadic culture\n\nthousands of years ago but that modern society would certainly question, if not outright\n\n                                             119\n\fignore. Indeed, it seems absurd to consider an amendment to Montana’s Constitution\n\nauthorizing the possession of slaves (Leviticus 25:44), or requiring the burning of animals\n\nas a sacrifice to God (Leviticus 1:2-17), or prohibiting intercourse with menstruating\n\nwomen (Leviticus 15:19-24), or prohibiting the consumption of shellfish (Leviticus\n\n11:10-12), or prohibiting a blind or lame person from approaching the altar of God\n\n(Leviticus, 21:18-20), or prohibiting the trimming of one’s hair, especially at the temples\n\n(Leviticus 19:27), or prohibiting any contact with or consumption of dead pigs (Leviticus\n\n11:7-8), or prohibiting the planting of two different crops in the same field (Leviticus\n\n19:19), or prohibiting the wearing of mixed linen and wool (Leviticus 19:19), or requiring\n\nthe stoning of those who blaspheme (Leviticus 24:10-16).\n\n¶194 As already stated, this is not meant to disparage or trivialize biblical teachings. In\n\nterms of sectarian doctrine and ritual, people have the right to believe and practice\n\nwhatever they choose. That is the very essence of the constitutional protection of the\n\n“free exercise” of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I; Mont. Const. art. II, § 5; Thomas v.\n\nRev. Bd. of Ind. Empl. Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 713, 101 S. Ct. 1425, 1430 (1981) (“[T]he\n\nFree Exercise Clause . . . gives special protection to the exercise of religion.”); St. John’s\n\nLutheran Church v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, 252 Mont. 516, 523, 830 P.2d 1271, 1276\n\n(1992) (“The right to freely exercise one’s religious beliefs without the interference of the\n\nstate is one of the most cherished and protected liberties in our society.”). The issue,\n\nrather, is whether religious followers “may use the power of the State to enforce [their]\n\nviews on the whole society” through operation of the State’s secular laws. Lawrence v.\n\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 571, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 2480 (2003). Clearly they may not do so in\n\n                                             120\n\flight of the First Amendment. Everson v. Bd. of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15, 67 S. Ct. 504, 511\n\n(1947) (“Neither a state nor the Federal Government . . . can pass laws which aid one\n\nreligion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another.”); Sch. Dist. of Abington\n\nTownship v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 226, 83 S. Ct. 1560, 1573-74 (1963) (“While the\n\nFree Exercise Clause clearly prohibits the use of state action to deny the rights of free\n\nexercise to anyone, it has never meant that a majority could use the machinery of the\n\nState to practice its beliefs. . . . In the relationship between man and religion, the State is\n\nfirmly committed to a position of neutrality.” (emphasis omitted)); Lemon v. Kurtzman,\n\n403 U.S. 602, 612, 91 S. Ct. 2105, 2111 (1971) (legislation “must have a secular\n\nlegislative purpose,” and “its principal or primary effect must be one that neither\n\nadvances nor inhibits religion”); cf. Thomas, 450 U.S. at 717-18, 101 S. Ct. at 1432 (the\n\nstate may neither condition receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a\n\nreligious faith, nor deny such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief).\n\n“In the words of [Thomas] Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law\n\nwas intended to erect ‘a wall of separation between church and State.’ ” Everson, 330\n\nU.S. at 16, 67 S. Ct. at 512.\n\n¶195 My focus here, however, is not on federal law. My analysis instead focuses solely\n\non Montana’s Constitution because it, unlike its federal counterpart, is burdened with the\n\nMarriage Amendment.\n\n                   D. Constitutionality of the Marriage Amendment\n\n¶196 The Montana Constitution makes it clear that the right and power of government\n\noriginates with the people, and they may amend the Constitution whenever they deem it\n\n                                             121\n\fnecessary. Mont. Const. art. II, §§ 1, 2. Yet, one will search in vain for a provision in the\n\nConstitution authorizing the people to amend that document so as to effect some social\n\npolicy or majoritarian ideology that is, itself, contrary to constitutional principles. Quite\n\nsimply, “while the people may amend the Constitution, they may not violate it in the\n\nprocess.” Reichert v. State, 2012 MT 111, ¶ 68, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455.\n\n¶197 By way of example, the people could not enact additional “General Provisions” in\n\nArticle XIII that would prohibit marriages between Catholics and Protestants, prohibit\n\nwomen from working outside the home, and create a committee of business and religious\n\nleaders to sanitize media stories. Such amendments would clearly run afoul of Article II,\n\nSections 4, 3, and 7, respectively (not to mention their counterparts in the federal\n\nConstitution). Such amendments would themselves be inherently unconstitutional.\n\n¶198 In the same fashion, the people do not have the power to constitutionalize religious\n\ndoctrine. Again, by way of example, the people could not adopt an amendment that\n\nrequired all church worship services to be conducted on Sunday, or that denied certain\n\ngovernmental services to persons who were not “born again,” or that prohibited women\n\nfrom being ordained as ministers. And for the same reasons, religious teachings that\n\nhomosexuality is a sin cannot be made part of Montana’s secular law—as the proponents\n\nof CI-96 have attempted to do through the Marriage Amendment. The Achilles heel of\n\nthe Marriage Amendment is that it is the wolf of constitutionalized religious doctrine\n\nparading in the sheep-suit of social policy.\n\n¶199 Unlike the Marriage Amendment, Article II, Section 5 is a “fundamental right.”\n\nKortum-Managhan v. Herbergers NBGL, 2009 MT 79, ¶ 25, 349 Mont. 475, 204 P.3d\n\n                                               122\n\f693. It provides that “[t]he state shall make no law respecting an establishment of\n\nreligion . . . .” Mont. Const. art. II, § 5. The Montana Constitution itself is “the supreme\n\nlaw of this State.” Associated Press v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., 246 Mont. 386, 391, 804 P.2d\n\n376, 379 (1991) (emphasis added). Thus, when the State, through the initiative process,\n\n“makes a law” that serves no purpose other than to codify a religious canon—here, select\n\nportions of Genesis and Leviticus—the State clearly violates Article II, Section 5. One\n\ncan only imagine the uproar if the State began incorporating doctrines from the Koran or\n\nsome other religion’s sacred text into the Constitution. Yet, that is precisely what the\n\nMarriage Amendment did. Through the initiative process, the State constitutionalized the\n\nbiblical abhorrence for homosexuality by prohibiting same-sex couples not only from\n\nmarrying but, according to the State and its amici, from enjoying any sort of legal\n\nprotection for their relationships. Such protections are instead to be reserved to the\n\nbiblically favored class of different-sex couples.\n\n¶200 The Bible’s condemnation of homosexuality aside, marriage clearly has—and has\n\nhad for centuries—two separate components. There is the sectarian component: Various\n\nreligions have doctrines, rituals, and proscriptions regarding marriage. Under the Free\n\nExercise Clause, religions may choose to adopt any desired beliefs, practices, or rituals\n\n(within reason 13). See St. John’s, 252 Mont. at 523, 830 P.2d at 1276; Griffith v. Butte\n\nSch. Dist. No. 1, 2010 MT 246, ¶ 62, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321. If some religious\n\ninstitutions wish to condemn same-sex relationships, they are free to do so. Conversely,\n\n       13\n          Under prevailing law, religions—at least in this country—cannot sanction\nincest, female genital mutilation, polygamy, honor killing, and similar practices, even if\nsuch practices are divinely inspired.\n                                            123\n\fif others wish to perform same-sex marriages, they likewise are free to do so. Article II,\n\nSection 5 guarantees that each religion may adhere to its own doctrines, practices, and\n\nrituals. Under Article II, Section 5, the State cannot force any religion or sectarian\n\norganization to perform same-sex weddings or to recognize same-sex marriages, nor can\n\nit penalize any religion or sectarian organization for refusing to do so—Proponent’s\n\nnonsensical statements in the 2004 Voter Information Pamphlet to the contrary\n\nnotwithstanding.\n\n¶201 The right of citizens to practice their religious beliefs is not what is at issue here,\n\nhowever. It is the other component of marriage—the secular component—that is at issue.\n\nLike many other states, Montana permits people to marry without the involvement of any\n\ninstitutionalized religion or sectarian organization. People may choose to marry in a\n\ncompletely civil ceremony. See § 40-1-301(1), MCA (“A marriage may be solemnized\n\nby a judge of a court of record, by a public official whose powers include solemnization\n\nof marriages, by a mayor, city judge, or justice of the peace, by a tribal judge, or in\n\naccordance with any mode of solemnization recognized by any religious denomination,\n\nIndian nation or tribe, or native group.”).       Importantly, what brings the marriage\n\nrelationship into existence in the eyes of the law is the properly executed marriage license\n\nissued by the State and the completion of certain medical tests and legal prerequisites.\n\nSee Title 40, chapter 1, parts 1 and 2, MCA; §§ 40-1-301(1), -321, -322, MCA. This is\n\nso regardless of the ceremony or ritual performed and regardless of who performs it. 14\n\n\n       14\n         Montana also recognizes common-law marriage and marriage performed by\n“declaration” without solemnization. See § 40-1-403, MCA. Common-law and declared\n                                            124\n\f“[L]aw (federal or state) is not concerned with holy matrimony. Government deals with\n\nmarriage as a civil status . . . . A state may enforce and dissolve a couple’s marriage, but\n\nit cannot sanctify or bless it. For that, the pair must go next door.” 15 Windsor v. United\n\nStates, 699 F.3d 169, 188 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis in original).\n\n¶202 With the governmentally created and licensed relationship, there also springs into\n\nexistence the various benefits and obligations at issue here. There is no religion or\n\nreligious institution in Montana that can create, provide, or deny statutory benefits and\n\nprotections incident to marriage. Only the State can do that. Certainly the State could\n\nchoose to provide no benefits at all for married couples. Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at\n\n426 (“the constitutional right to marry clearly does not obligate the state to afford specific\n\ntax or other governmental benefits on the basis of a couple’s family relationship”).\n\nIndeed, the State concedes in its brief that there is “no constitutional or judicially\n\nenforceable mandate for the Legislature to provide or fund spousal benefits.” 16 But the\n\npoint of this case is that the State has decided to make various benefits available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples, who may obtain them by marrying in either sectarian or secular\n\nceremonies, but has not made the same sorts of benefits available to same-sex couples\n\nwho, by reason of the Marriage Amendment, cannot marry. Although the same-sex\n\ncouples here do not claim the right to marry—acknowledging that the Marriage\n\nmarriages each have their own peculiar legal, but nonreligious, prerequisites. See In re\nMarriage of Swanner-Renner, 2009 MT 186, ¶ 17, 351 Mont. 62, 209 P.3d 238\n(common-law marriage); §§ 40-1-311 to -313 and -323 to -324 (declaration of marriage).\n       15\n          The court may have been referring to St. Andrews Roman Catholic Church,\nwhich is located next door to the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse.\n       16\n          While the State’s amici apparently take a different view, they have cited no\nauthority whatsoever for their premise that the State is required to grant such benefits.\n                                             125\n\fAmendment has denied them that ability—they do demand, and rightly so, that their\n\ngovernment accord them at least the benefits and protections provided to different-sex\n\nmarried couples in the State’s secular laws.\n\n¶203 In denying Plaintiffs these protections through the conduit of the Marriage\n\nAmendment, the State conflates religious canons regarding marriage with the State’s own\n\ncivil laws. This is patently unconstitutional. When the State chooses to enact secular\n\nlaws for the benefit of different-sex couples, but at the same time denies equal protection\n\nof those laws to same-sex couples because of sectarian proscriptions constitutionalized in\n\nthe Marriage Amendment, the State is engaged in blatant discrimination grounded in\n\nreligious doctrine. This sort of discrimination is unlawful not only under Article II,\n\nSection 5, but also under Article II, Section 4 (“Neither the state nor any person, firm,\n\ncorporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil\n\nor political rights on account of . . . religious ideas.”).   Indeed, when, on the basis of\n\nreligious doctrine, the State denies committed intimate same-sex couples the secular\n\nbenefits and civil rights incidental to the status of marriage, the State is guilty of at least\n\nthree abuses of the Constitution: the Equal Protection and Nondiscrimination Clauses of\n\nArticle II, Section 4; the Dignity Clause of Article II, Section 4; and the Establishment\n\nClause of Article II, Section 5.\n\n¶204 Before concluding this discussion, I have two final observations. First, to credit\n\nthe implicit (and explicit) fears expressed in the amicus briefs of the religious and “family\n\nvalues” organizations, one is led to believe that same-sex marriages are going to\n\noverwhelm (or dilute, as the State puts it) the now heterosexually dominated institution.\n\n                                               126\n\fThese fears are completely irrational. Indeed, were it not for its religious underpinnings,\n\nsuch homophobia would be bizarre.        For one thing, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and\n\ntransgender community is a relatively small minority. A Gallup report published in\n\nOctober 2012 reported that, nationally, 3.4 percent of U.S. adults answered “yes” when\n\nasked if they identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.       Of the remaining,\n\n92.2 percent answered “no” and 4.4 percent refused to answer or answered “don’t know.”\n\nRacial and ethnic minorities were more likely than white Americans to identify as\n\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender: 4.6 percent of African Americans, 4.3 percent of\n\nAsians, 4.0 percent of Hispanics, and 3.2 percent of Caucasians. And younger Americans\n\n(age 18 to 29) were more likely than seniors (age 65 and older) to identify as lesbian, gay,\n\nbisexual, or transgender: 6.4 percent versus 1.9 percent, respectively. See Gary J. Gates\n\n& Frank Newport, Special Report: 3.4% of U.S. Adults Identify as LGBT, http://www\n\n.gallup.com/poll/158066/special-report-adults-identify-lgbt.aspx (Oct. 18, 2012); Gary J.\n\nGates & Frank Newport, Gallup Special Report: The U.S. Adult LGBT Population,\n\nhttp://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/gallup-\n\nspecial-report-18oct-2012. Furthermore, in 2010, same-sex couples comprised a mere\n\n1 percent of all “couple” households in the United States. See U.S. Census, Same-Sex\n\nCouple Households, at 1 (Sep. 2011), http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acsbr10-\n\n03.pdf. Permitting these couples to enjoy their full measure of civil rights—much less\n\nmarry—would not denigrate the “institution of marriage” one iota. There is no actual\n\nevidence supporting the threat of ruination of families, businesses, churches, and\n\nchildrearing in the irreversibly horrendous ways predicted. Indeed, the evidence is to the\n\n                                            127\n\fcontrary, as already discussed. The scare tactics, misinformation, and propaganda used\n\nby the promoters of the Marriage Amendment were then, and remain now, not only false,\n\nbut patently absurd as well.\n\n¶205 Second, the institution of marriage has been and is, of course, completely\n\ndominated by heterosexuals. However, for all of the sanctimonious hyperbole about the\n\none-man/one-woman marital relationship, the nationwide rates of divorces in 1990, 2000,\n\nand 2009 were 48 percent, 49 percent, and 50 percent, respectively, relative to the rate of\n\nmarriages performed those same years. In Montana, the numbers were even higher:\n\n59 percent, 58 percent, and 55 percent, respectively. See U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical\n\nAbstract of the United States: 2012, at 98 (2011), http://www.census.gov/compendia/\n\nstatab.   Those who insist on the nuclear mother-father-children model appear to be\n\nwholly detached from the reality of modern America. While the number of “family\n\nhouseholds” increased 8 percent between 2000 and 2010, the percentage of such\n\nhouseholds falling into the “husband-wife with own children” category dropped from\n\n35 percent in 2000 to 30 percent in 2010. See U.S. Census Bureau, Households and\n\nFamilies: 2010, at 4-5 (Apr. 2012), http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-\n\n14.pdf. In 2004, 58 percent of children lived with their married, biological parents, down\n\nfrom 60 percent in 2001 and 61 percent in 1996. See U.S. Census Bureau, Living\n\nArrangements of Children: 2004, at 4 (Feb. 2008), http://www.census.gov/prod/\n\n2008pubs/p70-114.pdf. The “Beaver Cleaver” family of the 1950s simply does not\n\nrepresent modern America, and is not likely to be resurrected given the demographics,\n\ndemands, and exigencies of contemporary life in this country. In any event, if sectarian\n\n                                           128\n\fand “family values” organizations are intent on preserving the sanctity of marriage, it\n\nseems that their efforts and resources would be better spent focusing on the damage that\n\nheterosexuals are inflicting on the institution, rather than the imagined threat that\n\nhomosexuals and bisexuals supposedly pose. Furthermore, if those organizations are\n\nsetting out to reform American “morality” to the dictates of their own religious beliefs\n\nand to create a sort of Christian theocracy in this country not unlike the Islamic\n\ntheocracies prevalent in certain Middle Eastern countries, then they ought to candidly\n\ndisclose that fact rather than hiding behind the thoroughly disproved notion that reserving\n\nmarriage to different-sex couples is necessary for the protection of children and essential\n\nfor our survival as a nation.\n\n¶206 In conclusion, assuming for the sake of argument that it is even applicable in this\n\ncase, the Marriage Amendment cannot justify the State’s approach.             The Marriage\n\nAmendment is simply constitutionalized religious doctrine, and it cannot serve as a\n\nconduit for providing discretionary statutory benefits to some committed intimate couples\n\nwhile denying them to others. The benefits and obligations which the State creates under\n\nits secular law must not first be filtered through the sieve of religious doctrine in order to\n\nsee who gets what. Article II, Section 5 ensures the separation of church and state. The\n\nconstitutional quid pro quo is this: While the State is not permitted to be involved in the\n\nworkings of religious institutions, neither is the State permitted to enforce the doctrines,\n\ncanons, mandates, or proscriptions of any religion or sectarian organization. The State\n\nmay not “target” a class of individuals for disparate treatment in order to advance a\n\nreligious purpose or doctrine, without violating the Establishment Clause.\n\n                                             129\n\f                                   VI. CONCLUSION\n\n¶207 There are many who believe that gays and lesbians are second-class citizens; that\n\nthey are morally inferior; that they are objects worthy of societal scorn, derision, and\n\nhatred; that they may be reviled and demonized on the floor of the Legislature with\n\nimpunity; that they may be discriminated against by local governments; that they may be\n\nbullied in their schools and workplaces; and that they are not entitled to the same rights\n\naccorded to heterosexuals. Such views parallel those held by many—even the United\n\nStates Supreme Court—regarding racial minorities and women a century ago. Dred Scott\n\nv. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 407 (1857) (African-Americans, whether slave or free, were\n\n“altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations,”\n\nand “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect”); People v. Hall, 4 Cal.\n\n399, 404-05 (Cal. 1854) (the Chinese were “a race of people whom nature has marked as\n\ninferior, and who are incapable of progress or intellectual development beyond a certain\n\npoint”); Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412, 421-23, 28 S. Ct. 324, 326-27 (1908) (“[t]hat\n\nwoman’s physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a\n\ndisadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious”; “history discloses the fact that\n\nwoman has always been dependent upon man. He established his control at the outset by\n\nsuperior physical strength, and this control in various forms, with diminishing intensity,\n\nhas continued to the present”). We legitimize those similar, pernicious views about gays\n\nand lesbians when, as the Court does today, we abrogate our solemn obligation to declare\n\nand uphold the constitutional rights of all Montanans—especially those among us who\n\nhave been subjected to majoritarian and state-imposed hatred and discrimination.\n\n                                            130\n\f¶208 My abiding belief is that no person—no human being—in our society should be\n\nreviled, demonized, and discriminated against for being gay, lesbian, or bisexual, any\n\nmore than they should be treated in that fashion for being Native American, Presbyterian,\n\nfemale, disabled, poor, or Irish. No person should be the object of state-sanctioned\n\nbigotry simply for being born homosexual or for choosing to love another person of the\n\nsame sex. No person should be made to suffer the deprivation of their civil rights and\n\nliberties because of the religious beliefs and doctrines of others—doctrines that are now\n\nconstitutionalized in the Marriage Amendment and enforced by Montana’s government.\n\nAnd no person should be stripped of her or his inviolable human dignity based on sexual\n\norientation. Ever!\n\n¶209 It may be argued that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Montanans theoretically have won\n\na token victory today. But that simply is not the case. Their victory, if any, must yet be\n\ndetermined in the multitude of lawsuits that will have to be filed in the District Court here\n\nand in other trial courts. I doubt that any of these citizens will have the time, the money,\n\nor the fortitude to wage the required litigation jihad against their own government simply\n\nto obtain the same rights that their heterosexual fellow citizens enjoy. Realistically the\n\nPlaintiffs here have gained nothing. The problem, it should be noted, is not with their\n\ncounsel, who have done an excellent job of researching, briefing, and arguing the issues\n\nin this case. The problem, rather, is that this Court has chosen to punt. And in simply\n\nkicking the can down the road, the Court has denied Plaintiffs the dignity, respect,\n\nfairness, justice, and equality to which they are entitled—foremost as human beings, and\n\nlegally under Montana’s Constitution.\n\n                                            131\n\f¶210 Sexual orientation is a big deal to those who demand that their personal religious\n\nbeliefs, their Bible’s abhorrence, and their partisan ideology concerning homosexuality\n\nmust apply to everyone else, across the board, no exceptions. But future generations—\n\nindeed, most young people today—will not fear, much less honor, the sexual-orientation\n\ntaboo. The taboo will die because of education, science, 17 and changing social mores,\n\nand because of the small, real victories that lesbian, gay, and bisexual citizens have won.\n\nSee e.g. Gryczan v. State, 283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997); Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ.\n\nSys., 2004 MT 390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445; Kulstad v. Maniaci, 2009 MT 326, 352\n\nMont. 513, 220 P.3d 595. Most importantly, though, the taboo will die because the scare\n\ntactics, propaganda, and misinformation of those who would hang on to the maledictions\n\nand stereotypes have proven to be so patently false, malicious, and absurd. Most decent\n\npeople just hate being lied to. Indeed, a not-too-distant generation of Montanans will\n\nconsign today’s decision, the Marriage Amendment, and the underlying intolerance to the\n\ndustbin of history and to the status of a meaningless, shameful, artifact.\n\n                                         Epilogue\n\n¶211 This will be my last opportunity to sit as a member of this Court on a case\n\ninvolving the fight for the dignity and the civil and human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual,\n\nand transgender people. I had hoped—indeed, believed—that the work this Court started\n\n15 years ago in Gryczan would be brought to fruition and successfully concluded with\n\n\n       17\n         Indeed, with every advancement in science, religion loses ground. The more\nhumans learn and understand about the laws that actually control the universe, the less is\ntheir need to rely on gods, miracles, and myths to explain that which they do not\nunderstand.\n                                            132\n\four decision in this case. Sadly, that is not to be. As I have, I can strenuously disagree\n\nwith this Court’s decision. Regrettably, however, I have been unsuccessful in doing more\n\nthan that. I know how frustrating today’s decision must be for the committed same-sex\n\ncouples and for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Montanans across this State.\n\n¶212 Our collective frustration and sadness aside, however, if we have learned anything\n\nas an evolving species, it is that no government, no religion, no institution, and no\n\npolitical party can long oppress the inviolable dignity and spirit of human beings in their\n\nfight for fairness in the courts, access to justice, and equal protection of the laws. Those\n\nare the seminal principles upon which our country was founded, and they are the\n\nbirthright of every natural person on this planet, without exception. Those rights will not\n\nbe long denied to those suffering the scourge of discrimination and hatred.             The\n\ncommitted couples here—and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Montanans\n\neverywhere—must never lose sight of the fact that although today’s battle has been lost,\n\nthe war has not been. They must remain united in defeat because, in the end, they will\n\novercome; they will prevail. Of that, I am absolutely certain.\n\n¶213 For the foregoing reasons, I strenuously dissent.\n\n\n\n                                                  /S/ JAMES C.

In 2010 they sued the State of Montana, complaining\n\nthat they are unable to obtain protections and benefits that are available to similarly-\n\nsituated different-sex couples who marry under State law. Plaintiffs expressly do not\n\nchallenge Montana law’s restriction of marriage to heterosexual couples, do not seek the\n\nopportunity to marry, and do not seek the designation of marriage for their relationships.\n\nThey contend however that there is a “statutory structure” in Montana law that prohibits\n\nthem from enjoying “significant relationship and family protections and obligations\n\nautomatically provided to similarly-situated different-sex couples who marry.”\n\f¶2     Plaintiffs contend that this statutory structure interferes with their rights under\n\nArticle II of the Montana Constitution, including their rights to equal protection, due\n\nprocess, and the rights to privacy, dignity and the pursuit of life’s necessities. They seek\n\na declaration that the State’s failure to provide them access to the statutory scheme\n\navailable to different-sex couples denies them the rights guaranteed by Article II. They\n\nseek an injunction prohibiting the State from continuing to deny them access to the\n\nstatutory scheme.\n\n¶3     The District Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and granted\n\nthe State’s motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The District Court noted that\n\nPlaintiffs do not seek a declaration that any specific statutes are unconstitutional. The\n\nDistrict Court concluded that granting the relief sought—ordering the Legislature to enact\n\na statutory scheme to address Plaintiffs’ goals of achieving equal treatment—would be an\n\ninappropriate exercise of judicial power. Doing so, according to the District Court,\n\nwould run afoul of the separation of powers required by Article III, section 1 of the\n\nMontana Constitution.\n\n¶4     The District Court was also concerned that granting broad declaratory relief would\n\nlikely impact a large number of statutes in potentially unknown and unintended ways. In\n\nthe District Court proceedings Plaintiffs parenthetically listed a number of Montana\n\nstatutes that they contend are within the “statutory scheme” that denies them equal access\n\nto rights and responsibilities. The District Court concluded, however that “what plaintiffs\n\nwant here is not a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a specific statute or set of\n\nstatutes but rather a direction to the legislature to enact a statutory arrangement.” The\n\n                                             2\n\fDistrict Court determined that while this had some appeal, such relief was\n\n“unprecedented and uncharted in Montana law.” The District Court concluded that “the\n\nproper ways to deal with Plaintiffs’ concerns are specific suits directed at specific,\n\nidentifiable statutes.” Plaintiffs appealed after the District Court denied their motion to\n\nalter or amend.\n\n¶5     On appeal Plaintiffs argue, without reference to specific statutes, that they are\n\n“excluded from the statutory scheme of benefits and obligations the state has associated\n\nexclusively with marriage.” Plaintiffs contend that a strict level of review is required, but\n\nthat even at the lowest levels of constitutional scrutiny the State cannot show a legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest in the current statutory scheme, and that it violates their rights\n\nunder Article II of the Montana Constitution. Plaintiffs contend that the State excludes\n\nthem from access to unnamed benefits and obligations in violation of Montana’s\n\nconstitutional rights of privacy, dignity and the pursuit of life’s basic necessities.\n\nPlaintiffs contend that they are entitled to a declaratory judgment and to injunctive relief\n\nto redress the violation of their rights. Plaintiffs contend that while they can obtain relief\n\nwithout a judicial order requiring the Legislature to act, such an order is a remedy well\n\nwithin established constitutional bounds.\n\n¶6     Plaintiffs ask that the judgment of the District Court be reversed and the case\n\nremanded to grant Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as well as a declaratory\n\njudgment and injunction. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f¶7     As a general rule, this Court will not disturb a district court’s determination that\n\ndeclaratory relief is not necessary or proper unless the district court abused its discretion.\n\nMiller v.

In the present case, however, Plaintiffs do not seek a\n\ndeclaration that any particular statute is unconstitutional or that its implementation should\n\nbe enjoined. Rather, Plaintiffs seek a general declaration of their rights and seek orders\n\nenjoining the State to provide them a “legal status and statutory structure” that protects\n\ntheir rights.\n\n¶9     We agree with the District Court that Plaintiffs’ requested relief exceeds the\n\nbounds of a justiciable controversy, Gryczan v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 442, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"884297\"><a href=\"/opinion/884297/gryczan-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n117 (1997), and decline to provide the declaratory relief requested. It is the opinion of\n\nthis Court that the broad injunction and declaratory judgment sought by Plaintiffs would\n\nnot terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding. Instead, a\n\nbroad injunction and declaration not specifically directed at any particular statute would\n\nlead to confusion and further litigation. As the District Court aptly stated: “For this\n\n                                              4\n\fCourt to direct the legislature to enact a law that would impact an unknown number of\n\nstatutes would launch this Court into a roiling maelstrom of policy issues without a\n\nconstitutional compass.” A district court may refuse to enter a declaratory judgment if it\n\nwould not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceedings, § 27-8-\n\n206, MCA; Miller, ¶ 7. Courts do not function, even under the Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct, to determine speculative matters, to enter anticipatory judgments, to declare social\n\nstatus, to give advisory opinions or to give abstract opinions.

That presumption can only be overcome\n\nafter careful consideration of the purpose and effect of the statute, employing the proper\n\nlevel of scrutiny. Oberson, ¶ 22 (analyzing the constitutionality of the snowmobile\n\nliability statute, § 23-2-653, MCA).      Broadly determining the constitutionality of a\n\n“statutory scheme” that may, according to Plaintiffs, involve hundreds of separate\n\nstatutes, is contrary to established jurisprudence.\n\n¶11    This Court may fashion the relief warranted by any appeal. Section 3-2-204,\n\nMCA. It is this Court’s opinion that Plaintiffs should be given the opportunity, if they\n\nchoose to take it, to amend the complaint and to refine and specify the general\n\nconstitutional challenges they have proffered. For example, the record contains several\n\n                                              5\n\faffidavits from the named Plaintiffs and others that assert that they have suffered\n\ndiscrimination from the State’s failure to recognize their relationships. While Plaintiffs’\n\nbrief listed Title 40 of the Montana Code as an area of family law that furthers such\n\ndiscrimination, the dismissal of this action because of Plaintiffs’ broad claims has\n\nprecluded the development of claims that specific statutes promote or cause\n\ndiscrimination. These are important issues and should be decided only after the statutes\n\ninvolved are specifically identified and specifically analyzed in district court proceedings.\n\n¶12    Montana law generally favors allowing a party to amend its pleadings.

I agree with the Court\n\nand the District Court that the remedy sought in Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief—that the\n\ncourt issue an order requiring the State to offer Plaintiffs “a legal status and statutory\n\nstructure that confers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-\n\nsex couples who marry”—is overly broad and not justiciable. Opinion, ¶ 8. Further, I\n\n                                              7\n\fhave no objection to remanding the case to allow Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their\n\npleadings to start the case anew. Opinion, ¶¶ 12-13. This is the procedural equivalent to\n\nfiling a different legal challenge after dismissal of a case, which the Plaintiffs are entitled\n\nto pursue. Thus, I have signed the Court’s Opinion.\n\n¶17    I write separately to address the District Court’s analysis of the Marriage\n\nAmendment to the Montana Constitution, and to explain the Amendment’s application to\n\nPlaintiffs’ substantive equal protection contentions set forth in Count I of their complaint.\n\nI believe that the Amendment provides another basis to affirm the District Court’s\n\ndismissal of Count I, in addition to the overly broad nature of the relief sought.\n\n¶18    The District Court reasoned that, while “this Court does not necessarily feel that\n\nMontana’s marriage amendment bars it from acting,” nonetheless “the existence of the\n\nmarriage amendment plays into the jurisprudential decision that Plaintiffs’ requested\n\nrelief constitutes an impermissible sojourn into the powers of the legislative branch.” I\n\nagree that the Marriage Amendment is applicable, but believe the District Court\n\nunderstated its significance.     With its passage, the law’s historical designation of\n\nmarriage as between a man and a woman—and the exclusive treatment premised\n\nthereon—became an expressly constitutional classification.\n\n¶19    Count I alleges that “Plaintiffs are similarly situated in every material respect to []\n\ndifferent-sex couples” and that the State’s exclusion of Plaintiffs from the benefits and\n\nobligations “that the State offers to similarly-situated different-sex couples through the\n\nlegal status of marriage impermissibly subjects Plaintiffs to unequal treatment” and\n\nconstitutes “State discrimination.” With all due respect to Plaintiffs, I believe their equal\n\n                                              8\n\fprotection claim must fail under longstanding and deeply rooted legal principles, in both\n\nMontana and national jurisprudence. Under the law, discussed below, marriage between\n\na man and woman is a unique relationship, dissimilar to all other relationships and alone\n\nessential to the nation’s foundation and survival, and the State errs neither by recognizing\n\nit as such nor by giving it exclusive treatment. In sum, it is not discrimination to treat\n\nuniquely that which is unique.\n\n¶20    Plaintiffs emphasize that they are not seeking the right to marry, but nonetheless\n\nclaim in Count I that they are entitled to all of the “protections, rights, benefits, duties,\n\nresponsibilities, and obligations” which the State grants based upon marriage. During\n\noral argument, Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that the relief sought would strip from\n\nthe law the exclusive treatment of marriage as a basis for providing any concrete legal\n\nbenefit.   The only exclusive meaning left to marriage, counsel said, would be\n\naspirational: “How people view it, how symbolic and how important and how solemn it\n\nis.” The question thus posed by Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is whether the State is\n\nbarred by the Constitution from using marriage as an exclusive basis for granting any\n\nconcrete legal entitlement.\n\n¶21    As we have explained, “[t]he first step in an equal protection analysis is to\n\n‘identify the classes involved, and determine if they are similarly situated.’” Jaksha v.\n\nSilver Bow Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888912\"><a href=\"/opinion/888912/jaksha-v-butte-silver-bow-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 16, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888912\"><a href=\"/opinion/888912/jaksha-v-butte-silver-bow-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888912\"><a href=\"/opinion/888912/jaksha-v-butte-silver-bow-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (citation omitted). “‘If\n\nthe classes are not similarly situated, then . . . it is not necessary for us to analyze the\n\nchallenge further.’” Kershaw v.

Married couples\n\nrole-model and thereby teach procreative relationships and the procreative lifestyle to\n\nchildren of the marriage as they are raised, ensuring that marriage’s human\n\nrace-sustaining functions upon which the survival and stability of society depend are\n\npassed to and replicated by the next generation.\n\n¶26    The replication, by children, of the procreative marital relationship as\n\nrole-modeled by their married parents not only perpetuates the race-sustaining function\n\nby populating the race, but also builds extended families which share hereditary\n\n                                            12\n\fcharacteristics of a common gene pool. Throughout history, this genetic commonality\n\nhas provided an invaluable tool to enhance human survival. Common hereditary traits\n\nprovide critical understanding of an extended family’s physical and mental strengths,\n\nweaknesses, and susceptibility to disease and death. Even before the advent of modern\n\nscience, this information was collectively shared among extended family members and\n\nserved to alert and prepare them for eventualities related to the onset of disease and other\n\nlife patterns, thus strengthening their health and livelihood.           Modern medical\n\ntechnologies have only increased this capability, as research of an extended family’s\n\ngenetics now serves to predict, detect, and treat common, family-related diseases, further\n\nenhancing human survival.\n\n¶27    Upon extended families are built people groups or ethnic groups of individual\n\nraces, tribes, kindred, and nationalities based upon their broadly shared genetic\n\ncharacteristics. In addition to developing understanding about their mutually shared\n\nhealth risks, people groups throughout history have looked outward to their physical\n\nsurroundings and, based upon their common genetics and collective experiences, have\n\nobtained the knowledge necessary for their people to adapt to and function well in the\n\nphysical environment, thus enhancing their health and longevity. People groups around\n\nthe world have been linked to make up the larger human race. While world customs and\n\ncultures vary greatly, these societies share the common foundational element of a woman\n\nand a man united in marriage. It is little wonder the Supreme Court has said that\n\nmarriage is “fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.” Zablocki, 434\n\nU.S. at 384 (citing Skinner, 316 U.S. at 541).        One court well summed up these\n\n                                            13\n\fprinciples: “[T]he State has a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of\n\nmarriage (whether based on self-preservation, procreation, or in nurturing and keeping\n\nalive the concept of marriage and family as a basic fabric of our society), as old and as\n\nfundamental as our entire civilization, which institution is deeply rooted and long\n\nestablished in firm and rich societal values.” In re Estate of Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n688 (N.Y.

It is\n\nalso a public act which serves a public function critical to society, that of bringing\n\ntogether female and male to create and raise the future generation.

As the Supreme Court has explained, “when the\n\ncontract to marry is executed by the marriage, a relation between the parties is created\n\nwhich they cannot change.

According to the study, there were 1,138\n\nfederal statutes providing such benefits.” Conaway, 932 A.2d at 582 n. 6 (citations\n\nomitted). Plaintiffs provided the District Court with a list of over 340 Montana statutes\n\nthat classify based on marital status and that would be impacted by the proposed relief\n\nsought.\n\n¶32    While Plaintiffs do not claim the right to marry, they are nonetheless claiming\n\nconstitutional entitlement to all of these same rights and benefits which are provided to\n\nmarried couples on the ground that they are “similarly situated in every material respect.”\n\nHowever, this position ignores the historical and long-developed legal foundation and\n\nformal structure giving marriage an exclusive legal permanence, which does not exist for\n\nother relationships. More importantly, the above discussion, including the precedent\n\naddressing marriage and its unique attributes, demonstrates that Plaintiffs’ claim to be\n\n“similarly situated” to married couples is without merit. This is not meant to disparage\n\nPlaintiffs or minimize the contributions they offer, but is simply a statement of the reality\n\nthat marriage between a woman and man exclusively provides unique and transcendent\n\nsocietal protections vital to human survival which differentiate it and make it dissimilar\n\nfrom other relationships.    These protections uniquely provided by marriage form a\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\flegitimate and even compelling state interest, and thus a constitutional basis, for the\n\nState’s exclusive treatment of marriage.\n\n¶33    The above discussion of the law of marriage reflects the general state of the law\n\nbefore the Marriage Amendment was adopted by Montanans in 2004. Although some of\n\nthe cited cases were decided after adoption of the Marriage Amendment, they were\n\npremised upon pre-2004 precedent, and marriage was considered to be a fundamental\n\nright with constitutionally protected status at the time of the Amendment’s adoption.\n\nHowever, several years earlier, legal arguments attacking the exclusive status of marriage\n\nbegan to be offered, and considerable concern was generated over whether the law’s\n\nexclusive treatment of marriage would remain, or whether courts would begin to overturn\n\nlong-standing precedent favoring marriage. With all due respect, several courts indicated\n\na willingness to uproot established legal precedent recognizing the uniqueness of\n\nmarriage between a man and woman, and eliminate the law’s exclusive treatment of\n\nmarriage. See e.g. Baehr v. Lewin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Haw. 1993); Baker v.

To counter this threat to established\n\nprecedent favoring marriage, citizens of some 31 states acted to either reinstate the law’s\n\nexclusive definition and treatment of marriage in some manner, or to ensure that courts\n\ncould not eliminate such exclusive treatment, by amending their state constitutions to\n\nexplicitly protect marriage. Montana was one of those states.\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f¶35    Building on the foundation of historical legal protections for marriage, Montana\n\nvoters solidified the premise that marriage is between one man and one woman by\n\nplacing the concept expressly into the Montana Constitution. Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7.\n\nThe Voter Information Packet provided voters with the arguments for and against\n\nadoption of the Amendment.        Proponents stated that the “[t]he time-honored, vital\n\ninstitution of marriage is being threatened. . . . Special interest groups are constantly\n\nseeking to gain special rights that infringe on the rights of the rest of society. Such\n\nspecial rights cost all Montanans. . . . Voting yes on CI-96 allows the people to give clear\n\ndirection to judges on this important issue.”\n\n¶36    Directly related to this case, proponents discussed the issue of benefits which are\n\nattendant to marriage. “If CI-96 fails, how will homosexual marriage one day affect your\n\nfamily? . . . Small business employers in Montana may someday be required to provide\n\nexpanded health coverage, retirement and fringe benefits to same-sex ‘spouses’ of\n\nemployees. The broad subjectivity of such un-funded mandates could hurt Montana’s\n\neconomy and jobs.”      Opponents likewise also focused on benefits and obligations\n\nassociated with same-sex couples: “if CI-96 were to pass, the State could nullify the\n\ncontractual agreements made between same-gender partners.              CI-96 would limit\n\ninnovative and robust companies from treating their employees equitably.”           As the\n\nDistrict Court noted, both sides of the debate acknowledged “that the marriage\n\namendment would have something to do with the benefits and obligations that relate to\n\nthe status of being married.”\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f¶37    Proponents and opponents alike focused on the issue of benefits because everyone\n\nunderstood the law:     that marriage is a concrete legal status upon which the State\n\npremises exclusive treatment and benefits, as demonstrated by the above-cited authority.\n\nIt is more than a label, a societal choice, a union of two people, or an aspiration. Indeed,\n\nmarriage is an obligation given exclusive protections in the law because it provides\n\nexclusive protections to society. Even before adoption of the Marriage Amendment, this\n\nwas recognized in Montana statute. See e.g. §§ 40-1-101, 40-1-103, 40-1-401, 40-2-101,\n\n40-2-102, MCA.      Montana has long used marital status as an exclusive basis for\n\nprovision and allotment of benefits and obligations. See e.g. §§ 2-18-601, 19-17-405, 33-\n\n22-140, 39-51-2205, 39-71-723, 50-9-106, 72-2-112, 15-30-2114, 15-30-2366, MCA.\n\nBuilding on these statutory provisions and the prior holdings of our cases, Montana\n\ncitizens enacted the Marriage Amendment to expressly “constitutionalize” these\n\nprinciples, thereby strengthening the law’s exclusive treatment of marriage.

Marriage is\n\n                                             21\n\fmeaningful.”    When asked again, “In what way?            I’m trying to understand what\n\nconcrete[ness] in the law is left?” Counsel responded, “The significance is that you’re\n\nmarried.” However, such a diminished concept of marriage would necessitate a dramatic\n\nrewriting of the law. Marriage has always been much more—a concrete legal status\n\nwhich the law recognized and favored with exclusive treatment, including benefits and\n\nobligations.   In adopting the Marriage Amendment, Montana voters determined to\n\npermanently preserve this exclusive treatment for marriage by placing it in the\n\nConstitution. Thus, in one way, Plaintiffs are asking this Court to render the Marriage\n\nAmendment superfluous by holding that it added nothing to the law’s previous exclusive\n\nclassification of marriage. 6   But further, Plaintiffs are asking the Court to hold the\n\nMarriage Amendment actually had a reverse effect—that marriage has less legal\n\nprotection now than before the Amendment was passed, because marriage can no longer\n\nserve as the basis for exclusive treatment by the State. Clearly, this is directly contrary to\n\nthe “clear direction to judges” which the Marriage Amendment was designed to give.\n\n¶39    “The Equal Protection Clause ‘is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom,\n\nfairness, or logic of [the voters’] choices.’” Citizens for Equal Protec., 455 F.3d at 867\n\n(bracket in original) (quoting F.C.C. v.

Due to the success of these measures, it became “a constant theme of opponents\n\nof same-sex marriage that whenever it has been put before the voters it has lost.” Erik\n\nEckholm, In Maine and Maryland, Victories at the Ballot Box for Same-Sex Marriage,\n\nN.Y. Times (Nov. 7, 2012). That, however, is no longer true. In this most recent election\n\nof November 6, 2012, voters in Maine, Maryland, and Washington approved ballot\n\nmeasures authorizing same-sex couples to marry. And in Minnesota, voters defeated a\n\nballot measure that would have amended the Minnesota Constitution to limit marriage to\n\none man and one woman. It appears that a majority of voters in these states have seen\n\nthrough the scare tactics and propaganda which “family values” organizations and certain\n\nreligious groups have used to persuade the electorate that allowing same-sex marriage\n\nwill harm children, hurt businesses and the economy, intrude on religious freedoms, and\n\nundermine the institution of marriage itself. As discussed in greater detail later in this\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fDissent, there is no actual evidence supporting any of the maledictions and stereotypes\n\nused in the campaigns against same-sex marriage.\n\n¶48    Meanwhile, in Montana, the issue at hand is not about same-sex marriage. It is\n\nless dramatic, though by no means less important. It concerns the right of committed\n\nintimate same-sex couples to receive the same civil protections which the State makes\n\navailable to committed intimate different-sex couples. Plaintiffs assert, and rightly so,\n\nthat their government may not single out unpopular groups for disfavored treatment, as\n\nthe State of Montana has done here. Shockingly, this Court refuses to uphold this most\n\nbasic principle of constitutional law. While I have not always agreed with this Court’s\n\ndecisions—in fact, I have strenuously disagreed with my colleagues on occasion 2—I\n\nhave never disagreed more strongly with the Court as I do in this case. With due respect,\n\nI believe today’s decision, like those mentioned above, wrongly deprives an abused\n\nminority of their civil rights.\n\n¶49    This Dissent is lengthy. It is meant to be, for several reasons. First, I believe this\n\nis the most important civil rights case to come before this Court in decades.

The issues here are significant\n\nand complex, and deserving of thorough consideration, analysis, and discussion.\n\n¶50    Second, I am profoundly disappointed in this Court, as an institution, for rendering\n\na decision that requires Plaintiffs, the same-sex couples here, to wage a litigation jihad\n\nagainst their own government to obtain the statutory rights, benefits, and protections to\n\nwhich they are constitutionally entitled.       I have located no court decision in this\n\ncountry—state or federal—applying the declaratory judgment laws in the cabined and\n\nunworkable fashion that this Court does here.\n\n¶51    Lastly, I am thoroughly disheartened that today’s decision takes civil rights in this\n\nState backward to a time when court decisions supported and facilitated other equally\n\npernicious forms of government-sanctioned discrimination, including slavery and racial\n\nsegregation; women being viewed as little more than men’s dependents, unable to vote or\n\nown property; the Chinese being deemed an “inferior” race; the compulsory sterilization\n\nof the “feebleminded”; and the criminalization of private sexual intimacy between two\n\nconsenting adults. No other minority group has been treated in this fashion in this State\n\nin modern times. This, truly, is a shameful, black day for civil rights in Montana.\n\n¶52    Yet, while gay, lesbian, and bisexual citizens may have lost this battle, the war is\n\nnot over. If we have learned anything as an evolving species, it is that no government, no\n\nreligion, no institution, and no political party can long oppress the inviolable dignity and\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\fspirit of human beings in their fight for fairness in the courts, access to justice, and equal\n\nprotection of the laws.\n\n¶53    With these introductory remarks, I now proceed to my detailed discussion and\n\nanalysis. In Part II (¶¶ 57-80), I provide a background and overview of the case and the\n\nissues. In Part III (¶¶ 81-113), I explain the declaratory judgment laws and address in\n\ndetail the District Court’s and this Court’s erroneous analyses under those laws.\n\n¶54    Next, in Part IV (¶¶ 114-168), I analyze Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim. Given the\n\nevidence that gay, lesbian, and bisexual people are reviled and demonized in Montana\n\nand have suffered a history of invidious and prejudicial treatment, I conclude that sexual\n\norientation is a suspect class under Montana’s Equal Protection Clause, and thus that\n\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation in the provision of statutory benefits,\n\nprotections, and services must survive “strict scrutiny” review. I further conclude that\n\ntreating Plaintiffs differently based on sexual orientation is an affront to and violation of\n\ntheir inviolable right to human dignity, also protected by Montana’s Constitution.\n\n¶55    As a final matter, in Part V (¶¶ 169-206), I am compelled to address the so-called\n\nMarriage Amendment to Montana’s Constitution (Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7). Plaintiffs\n\ndo not ask to be “married,” and granting them the relief they seek does not offend that\n\nprovision in the slightest. Yet, the State relies on the Marriage Amendment as support\n\nfor its position, and the State’s argument before this Court is bolstered by an outpouring\n\nof attacks on the same-sex couples by no less than 128 Montana protestant churches and\n\nthe Montana Catholic Bishops, all appearing through the Montana Catholic Conference\n\nas amicus curiae, along with other “family values” organizations, also appearing as amici\n\n                                             29\n\fcuriae. The Marriage Amendment is the conduit through which the State and its amici\n\nclaim that it may deprive Plaintiffs—who, because of this provision, cannot marry—of\n\nthe statutory benefits and protections which the State grants to married couples. That the\n\nState and its amici have injected the Marriage Amendment into this case at all, however,\n\ndemonstrates, in spades, what that provision is really about: the constitutionalization of\n\nreligious doctrine. Indeed, what the State and its amici seek to do here is conflate\n\nsectarian canons regarding marriage with secular laws governing the provision of\n\nbenefits and protections to committed couples.      In my view, this approach violates\n\nseveral constitutional provisions, not the least of which is the clause in Montana’s\n\nDeclaration of Rights prohibiting the State from establishing religion. Emblematic of the\n\nreligiously grounded discrimination defended by the State and its amici is the blatant\n\nmendacity underlying the Marriage Amendment initiative—a fourberie reminiscent of\n\nsome of the worst propaganda campaigns perpetrated in modern times.\n\n¶56   In the last section of this Dissent, Part VI (¶¶ 207-212), I set forth my conclusions\n\nand provide a short epilogue.\n\n                       II. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW\n\n¶57   Plaintiffs here are twelve lesbian, gay, or bisexual individuals who are in six\n\ncommitted, intimate, same-sex relationships. As of the filing of their affidavits in the\n\nDistrict Court on December 10, 2010, plaintiffs Donaldson and Guggenheim had been in\n\na relationship for 27 years; Leslie and Haugland for 12 years; Stallings and Wagner for\n\n21 years; Gibson and Boettcher for 11 years; Long and Parker for 8 years; and Owens\n\nand Williams for 18 years. With their life partners, Plaintiffs have established families\n\n                                           30\n\fwhich provide them with long-term mutual emotional and economic support and a stable\n\nenvironment for raising children. Plaintiffs are employed in, or have retired from, a\n\nvariety of professions including teaching, coaching, counseling, engineering, music, art,\n\nand medicine. They are active in their children’s schools, in their churches, in their\n\nprofessions, and in their communities. One has served in the Montana Legislature. It is\n\nundisputed that Plaintiffs are productive members of society and have, in fact,\n\nsuccessfully raised a number of children. Some Plaintiffs are now grandparents.\n\n¶58    Plaintiffs desire to protect their family relationships in the same way their\n\nheterosexual neighbors, coworkers, and fellow community members are able to do under\n\nMontana law. Plaintiffs have taken some steps in this regard. For example, they have\n\nentered into joint tenancy arrangements on their houses and bank accounts and have\n\nexecuted powers of attorney, healthcare directives, and wills in favor of their partners.\n\nPlaintiffs point out, however, that such private legal arrangements can be expensive and,\n\nthus, are not available to many couples. Plaintiffs also express concerns about whether\n\nthese arrangements will be honored—especially in the event of a medical emergency.\n\nSome Plaintiffs describe (in their affidavits) past incidents when healthcare personnel\n\nrefused to speak with them about their partner’s condition. Another Plaintiff (Leslie)\n\ndescribes how she and her former partner, Erika, took many of the legally available steps\n\nto protect their relationship. Yet, after Erika died in a work-related accident on Christmas\n\nDay 1996, which was their eighth anniversary, Leslie found herself “powerless and\n\ndegraded” and treated like a “legal stranger” when she attempted to exercise the\n\nresponsibilities of a partner. She was denied access to Erika’s remains; she was denied a\n\n                                            31\n\fcopy of the death certificate by the sheriff because she was a “stranger in blood”; she was\n\nrefused paid bereavement leave by her employer (the same employer for whom Erika had\n\nbeen working when she was killed) and thus had to go back to work only a week after\n\nErika’s death; she had no rights under the intestacy laws with regard to Erika’s property;\n\nshe had no legal means to prevent Erika’s family from entering their home, going through\n\ntheir belongings, and taking Erika’s possessions, many of which the two had shared as\n\ndomestic partners; and, to add insult to injury, she was required to pay inheritance taxes\n\non the proceeds from Erika’s half of their condominium, which Leslie was forced to sell.\n\n¶59    The underlying issue, as the District Court stated in its Order, is that “individuals\n\nsuch as Plaintiffs are denied a variety of benefits and protections that are statutorily\n\navailable to heterosexual spouses.” The District Court identified some of these statutes\n\nand noted some of the “real life scenarios” in which these laws have affected Plaintiffs.\n\nFor example, Montana’s intestacy laws and workers’ compensation laws provide certain\n\nprotections to the surviving spouse of a different-sex relationship, but not to the surviving\n\npartner of a same-sex relationship. Likewise, bereavement leave is made available to a\n\ndifferent-sex spouse but not to a same-sex partner. Furthermore, Plaintiffs are unable\n\nunder Montana’s tax laws to file joint returns or to take the spousal exemption for\n\nnonworking spouses if filing separately. Montana law permits the different-sex spouse of\n\na terminally ill person to withhold life-sustaining treatment, but does not afford this right\n\nto the same-sex partner of a terminally ill person. Similarly, the different-sex spouse of a\n\nperson who has become mentally incompetent has priority to become guardian, but a\n\nsame-sex partner does not have this same right.\n\n                                             32\n\f¶60    If not for the fact that each couple consists of two members of the same sex,\n\nPlaintiffs’ relationships could qualify as “marriage” under Montana law.

As noted, however, Plaintiffs do not ask to be granted the status of\n\n“married.” For purposes of this case, Plaintiffs only seek a determination that they are\n\nentitled, as a matter of constitutional law, to obtain the same rights and benefits—along\n\nwith the same mutual responsibilities and obligations—which the State of Montana has\n\nchosen to grant to different-sex married couples. The premise underlying this claim is\n\nthat “marriage” does not include an exclusive right to any particular rights and benefits\n\nconferred by the government, and that “marriage” connotes something other than just the\n\nreceipt of such rights and benefits.

Therefore, Plaintiffs argue, when\n\nthe State chooses to make benefits and protections available to persons in committed\n\nintimate relationships, the State must do so evenhandedly, without discriminating on the\n\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the persons in those relationships.

For starters, rather than concede the elementary premise of this\n\nlawsuit—that it is a denial of equal protection to make statutory protections available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples, who may obtain them by getting married, but to categorically deny\n\nthem to same-sex couples, who are not able to get married—the Attorney General instead\n\nattempts to justify and prolong this institutionalized discrimination being perpetrated by\n\nthe State of Montana against a discrete minority of its citizens. 3 Frankly, the State’s\n\n\n\n      3\n         In contrast, see e.g. Perry v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008 (Cal. 2011): “The\nanswer filed by the [California] Attorney General also declined to defend the initiative,\nbut went further and affirmatively took the position that Proposition 8 [which amended\nthe California Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage] is unconstitutional.” See also\ne.g. Ltr. from Eric H. Holder Jr., U.S. Atty. Gen., to John A. Boehner, Speaker, U.S.\nH.R., at 2 (Feb. 23, 2011) (Dkt. 42 in the District Court record): “[T]he President [of the\nUnited States] and I have concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation\n                                            35\n\farguments in this regard are inconsistent and difficult to follow. On one hand, the State\n\nconcedes that the Legislature could provide committed intimate same-sex couples with\n\nsimilar benefits as are afforded to different-sex married couples. Yet, on the other hand,\n\nthe State suggests that any benefits provided to different-sex married couples cannot also\n\nbe provided to same-sex couples due to the Marriage Amendment. This reasoning is\n\nclearly a non sequitur for reasons discussed in greater detail in the Marriage Amendment\n\nsection below. See ¶¶ 174-179, infra. For the time being, it suffices to point out that the\n\nMarriage Amendment merely states: “Only a marriage between one man and one woman\n\nshall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.” And, as noted, Plaintiffs are not\n\nasking that their relationships be recognized as “marriage.” Furthermore, the Marriage\n\nAmendment does not require the State to grant married couples tax benefits, or the right\n\nto make medical decisions for a spouse, or the right to death benefits under the workers’\n\ncompensation laws, etc. Nor does it say that these sorts of benefits and protections, if the\n\nState chooses to grant them, may not also be offered to unmarried persons. The State\n\nconcedes that the Legislature could enact a civil-union or domestic-partnership scheme.\n\n¶64    Perhaps for these reasons, the State ultimately takes the position that Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional claim should not be decided at all. The reason: a ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor\n\ncould result in the invalidation of “innumerable” unspecified statutes. Yet, surely the fact\n\nthat Plaintiffs are being discriminated against in “innumerable” ways is reason to hasten a\n\ndecision on the merits of their claim, not delay it. Regrettably, however, a majority of\n\n\nwarrant heightened scrutiny and that, as applied to same-sex couples legally married\nunder state law, Section 3 of [the Defense of Marriage Act] is unconstitutional.”\n                                            36\n\fthis Court defers to the Attorney General’s approach. Instead of requiring the State to\n\ndemonstrate the constitutionality of its practices, the Court punts. The Court implies that\n\nPlaintiffs are to blame—that their failure to “specifically identify” and “specifically\n\nanalyze” the “specific statutes” that are discriminatory somehow precludes us from\n\ndeclaring Plaintiffs’ rights. Opinion, ¶¶ 9, 11, 13. How the Court expects Plaintiffs to\n\npresent their claim is not entirely clear from the Court’s opaque analysis. But a careful\n\ninspection reveals the Court’s rationale to be entirely disingenuous in any event.\n\n¶65    First of all, Plaintiffs have identified numerous statutes which grant benefits and\n\nprotections to different-sex spouses but not to same-sex partners. Indeed, after observing\n\nin its Order that “Plaintiffs are denied a variety of benefits and protections that are\n\nstatutorily available to heterosexual spouses,” the District Court lists a slew of those\n\nstatutes. Furthermore, Plaintiffs attached a laundry list of the discriminatory statutes to\n\ntheir motion to alter or amend the judgment. That list is attached as Appendix 1 to this\n\nDissent. If what the Court needs is a specific statute to analyze, the Court can simply\n\npick one of the numerous statutes identified in the District Court’s Order or in Plaintiffs’\n\nlist, and assess its validity in light of the parties’ arguments. The constitutional principles\n\nof the Court’s analysis could then be extrapolated and applied to other statutes.\n\n¶66    Secondly, if the Court is suggesting that Plaintiffs may not obtain a declaratory\n\nruling until they have specifically identified every single discriminatory statute, it appears\n\nentirely likely that the extensive list of statutes attached to Plaintiffs’ motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment is, in fact, a listing of every single discriminatory statute. If that is\n\nwhat the Court needs, then the Court need look no further than Plaintiffs’ motion, which\n\n                                              37\n\fis contained in the District Court record. More importantly, however, the Court has cited\n\nno authority whatsoever for requiring Plaintiffs to identify all of the discriminatory\n\nstatutes. In fact, as I discuss in further detail below, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct enables Plaintiffs to obtain a declaration of their rights in a single lawsuit, without\n\nnecessarily identifying each and every discriminatory statute.\n\n¶67    Thirdly, if the Court is suggesting that Plaintiffs must challenge each statute on an\n\nindividual basis, the Court has cited no authority for this approach either. Indeed, one\n\npurpose of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is to avoid such seriatim litigation.\n\nAs Plaintiffs reminded the District Court in their motion to alter or amend the judgment,\n\nthey sought declaratory relief “in part to avoid this type of expensive and protracted\n\nlitigation that would drain judicial resources while prolonging the harm experienced by\n\nPlaintiffs and their families.” Cf. McGillivray v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"885173\"><a href=\"/opinion/885173/mcgillivray-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 9-11, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">19</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (concluding that declaratory relief was the only “reasonable remedy”\n\nwhere, absent such relief, only those plaintiffs who had “the financial resources and\n\npersonal fortitude to endure four different court proceedings” would be able to exercise\n\ntheir claimed constitutional right, while those plaintiffs “who will not or cannot afford\n\nthis extensive litigation would be denied their right”).     Indeed, forcing Plaintiffs to\n\nchallenge each of the “innumerable” statutes in piecemeal fashion is not only manifestly\n\nunfair to them, it is an enormous waste of resources, given that the underlying legal\n\nquestion is the same with respect to each statute at issue. Montana taxpayers, who will\n\nhave to foot the State’s legal bills for defending each of these “innumerable” lawsuits,\n\nshould be appalled by the Court’s and the Attorney General’s approach here.\n\n                                            38\n\f¶68    I think it is worth noting that the Court’s and the Attorney General’s approach is\n\ncompletely out of step with other courts around the country—federal and state. For\n\nexample, Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, defines\n\n“marriage” as a legal union between one man and one woman, and defines “spouse” as a\n\nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife. Although these definitions have\n\n“varying impact on more than a thousand federal laws,” the Second Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals did not require the plaintiff to specifically identify those laws. Windsor v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180 (2d Cir. 2012). To the contrary, the court proceeded to\n\nanalyze her equal protection claim and concluded that “homosexuals compose a class that\n\nis subject to heightened scrutiny,” that the class is “quasi-suspect” and thus subject to\n\n“intermediate scrutiny,” and that “DOMA’s classification of same-sex spouses was not\n\nsubstantially related to an important government interest.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 185,\n\n188. Similarly, despite DOMA’s “ramifying application throughout the U.S. Code” and\n\nits “effects on the numerous federal programs at issue,” the First Circuit Court of Appeals\n\ndid not require the plaintiffs to identify the “economic and other benefits” impacted by\n\nDOMA. Massachusetts v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 2012).   The court simply analyzed the constitutionality of excluding same-sex\n\ncouples and concluded that “Congress’ denial of federal benefits to same-sex couples\n\nlawfully married in Massachusetts has not been adequately supported by any permissible\n\nfederal interest.” Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 16.\n\n¶69    In New Jersey, different-sex married couples are entitled to “a vast array of\n\neconomic and social benefits and privileges.” Lewis, 908 A.2d at 206. While same-sex\n\n                                            39\n\fcouples enjoyed various rights under New Jersey’s Domestic Partnership Act, they were\n\nstill denied “many benefits and privileges” accorded to married couples. Lewis, 908 A.2d\n\nat 215. In other words, the Domestic Partnership Act “failed to bridge the inequality gap\n\nbetween committed same-sex couples and married opposite-sex couples.” Lewis, 908\n\nA.2d at 215. The New Jersey Supreme Court noted a number of the rights afforded to\n\nmarried couples but denied to same-sex couples. The court did not require the plaintiffs,\n\nhowever, to go back to the trial court and re-file their constitutional challenge to this\n\nscheme—like this Court does in the present case—as “specific” challenges to “specific”\n\nstatutes. Rather, the court quite sensibly and logically explained that the constitutional\n\nquestion is “whether there is a public need to deny committed same-sex partners the\n\nbenefits and privileges available to heterosexual couples.” Lewis, 908 A.2d at 217.\n\nUltimately, the court held that “denying to committed same-sex couples the financial and\n\nsocial benefits and privileges given to their married heterosexual counterparts bears no\n\nsubstantial relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.” Lewis, 908 A.2d at 220.\n\n¶70   The fact that there were “hundreds” of statutes relating to marriage and to marital\n\nbenefits did not prevent the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts from ascertaining\n\nwhether the exclusion of same-sex couples from those benefits violated the state\n\nconstitution. Goodridge v. Dept. of Pub. Health, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 955 (Mass. 2003). The\n\ncourt noted some of the statutory benefits in its opinion, but saw no need “to be\n\ncomprehensive.” Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 955. The Hawaii Supreme Court also saw\n\nno such need. In considering the same-sex couples’ constitutional challenge, the court\n\nobserved that “a multiplicity of rights and benefits” are contingent upon the status of\n\n                                           40\n\fmarriage, but the court found it “unnecessary . . . to engage in an encyclopedic recitation\n\nof all of them.” Baehr v. Lewin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (Haw. 1993).\n\n¶71    The Vermont Supreme Court likewise had no difficulty analyzing the legality of\n\nexcluding same-sex couples from the “broad array of legal benefits and protections\n\nincident to the marital relation, including access to a spouse’s medical, life, and disability\n\ninsurance, hospital visitation and other medical decisionmaking privileges, spousal\n\nsupport, intestate succession, homestead protections, and many other statutory\n\nprotections.”   Baker, 744 A.2d at 870.       The court did not require the plaintiffs to\n\nspecifically identify and specifically analyze the specific statutes. Rather, the court\n\naddressed the question common to each: “whether the exclusion of same-sex couples\n\nfrom the benefits and protections incident to marriage under Vermont law” is\n\nunconstitutional. Baker, 744 A.2d at 880. The court ultimately found “a constitutional\n\nobligation to extend to plaintiffs the common benefit, protection, and security that\n\nVermont law provides opposite-sex married couples.” Baker, 744 A.2d at 886.\n\n¶72    I could continue, but I think the point is clear. In refusing to issue a declaratory\n\nruling as to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and in forcing them to instead litigate each\n\nstatutory protection individually, this Court sets itself up as the only court in the country\n\nto follow such an approach. In so doing, the Court commits grievous error.\n\n¶73    The instant case is no different than the cases cited above. “Marriage” in Montana\n\nis presently defined as “a personal relationship between a man and a woman arising out\n\nof a civil contract.” Section 40-1-103, MCA. Marriage between two persons of the same\n\nsex is prohibited. Section 40-1-401(1)(d), MCA; Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7. Hence, by\n\n                                             41\n\fdefinition, a person cannot be the “spouse” of someone who is the same sex. Black’s\n\nLaw Dictionary 1533 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009) (spouse: “a\n\nmarried person”). The State grants a broad array of legal benefits and protections to\n\n“spouses.” As but one example, § 37-19-904(2)(c), MCA, grants the surviving “spouse”\n\nthe right to control the disposition of the remains of a deceased person. Same-sex\n\ncouples are excluded from the operation of these statutes because, by definition, they\n\ncannot be “spouses” and because they are not encompassed within the scope of the\n\nstatutes in some other way. See e.g. § 45-5-206, MCA (for purposes of partner or family\n\nmember assault, “partners” means “spouses, former spouses, persons who have a child in\n\ncommon, and persons who have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate\n\nrelationship with a person of the opposite sex” (emphasis added)). Plaintiffs’ claim here\n\nis the same as the challengers’ claims in the above cases: excluding same-sex couples\n\nfrom the opportunity to obtain the protections of these laws is unconstitutional.\n\n¶74    As detailed in the Declaratory Judgment section below, there is simply no basis in\n\nlaw or in reason for requiring Plaintiffs to present their constitutional claim within the\n\ncontext of a challenge to a specific spousal benefit, or for requiring them to pursue\n\nindependent challenges to each benefit, or for requiring them to identify all of the\n\ndiscriminatory laws. The notion that they must “specifically identify” and “specifically\n\nanalyze” each of the “innumerable” statutes is, in reality, nothing more than a straw-man\n\nargument that the Attorney General has invented, and this Court has adopted, to avoid a\n\nsocially divisive issue. I cannot believe that if the statutes discriminated on the basis of\n\nrace, national origin, or religious affiliation, rather than sexual orientation, the Court\n\n                                            42\n\fwould concoct such an implausible procedural technicality as the Court does here to\n\nevade a legitimately presented constitutional question and deny the plaintiffs relief.\n\n¶75    For all of these reasons, the Court’s contention that it cannot issue a ruling on\n\nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights is devoid of any genuine or well-grounded underpinning.\n\nAnd so is the Court’s suggestion that Plaintiffs still need “to develop an argument as to\n\n. . . the level of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to [the discriminatory] laws\n\nby the courts.” Opinion, ¶ 13. Plaintiffs devote entire sections of their briefs to this exact\n\nquestion, arguing that sexual orientation is a suspect class and that the denial of statutory\n\nbenefits and obligations based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened\n\nscrutiny. It is not clear whether the Court has overlooked these sections of Plaintiffs’\n\nbriefs, or simply chosen to ignore them, but the argument is there. Perhaps the Court’s\n\nview is that the level of scrutiny varies from statute to statute depending on “the nature of\n\nthe State’s interest.” Opinion, ¶ 13. That, however, would be quite the novel approach to\n\nconstitutional law. Indeed, I am aware of no precedent, from any court in this country,\n\nholding that the level of scrutiny—rational basis, middle tier, or strict—is determined not\n\nby the classification or the constitutional right at issue, but by “the nature of the State’s\n\ninterest” in discriminating against the class or infringing the right. Such an approach\n\nturns equal protection and due process analysis on its head.\n\n¶76    If the reader is baffled by what the Court is requiring of Plaintiffs, he or she is not\n\nalone. As a purely factual matter, there is no dispute that the State, by statute, makes\n\ncertain benefits and obligations available to different-sex couples but denies same-sex\n\ncouples access to those same benefits and obligations. The legal question common to\n\n                                             43\n\fevery challenge Plaintiffs might lodge against these statutes is whether, under our\n\nConstitution, the State may categorically exclude homosexuals and bisexuals in\n\ncommitted intimate same-sex relationships from the opportunity to obtain the same\n\nstatutory protections made available to heterosexuals and bisexuals in committed intimate\n\ndifferent-sex relationships. There is no persuasive, let alone legitimate, reason why we\n\ncannot issue a ruling on this question. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that “the\n\nnature of the State’s interest” in excluding same-sex couples varies from statute to statute,\n\nthis does not preclude us from declaring what Plaintiffs’ rights are under traditional\n\nconstitutional principles. We can rule—and I would rule—that sexual orientation is a\n\nsuspect class and, therefore, that the State’s interest in denying same-sex couples the\n\nopportunity to obtain the statutory protections offered to different-sex couples must be\n\n“compelling.” Such a ruling is permitted by the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act,\n\nand it would adequately resolve this dispute. At that point, the legislative and executive\n\nbranches could take whatever steps are necessary to honor Plaintiffs’ civil rights—as\n\nlegislative and executive officers are constitutionally sworn to do (Mont. Const. art. III,\n\n§ 3)—in accordance with our decision.\n\n¶77    The Court tells Plaintiffs that they may amend their complaint and pursue further\n\nproceedings in the District Court. Opinion, ¶ 13. While this at least has the virtue of\n\nrescuing their claims from the District Court’s outright dismissal, I cannot agree that this\n\nremedy is adequate. To the contrary, refusing to declare Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights\n\nforthwith, and sending them back to the District Court for unnecessary re-litigation of a\n\nconstitutional question they have squarely presented to us in the instant appeal, is itself an\n\n                                             44\n\finfringement of those rights. It must not be forgotten that “[t]he rights here asserted are,\n\nlike all such rights, present rights; they are not merely hopes to some future enjoyment of\n\nsome formalistic constitutional promise.

Likewise, under Montana law, the courts of\n\nthis State (including the Montana Supreme Court) are courts of justice. Section 3-1-101,\n\nMCA. “Courts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for\n\nevery injury of person[.] . . . Right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial,\n\nor delay.” Mont. Const. art. II, § 16. This fundamental constitutional right is not simply\n\naccess to courts. It is access to justice—defined in Montana’s organic law to mean a\n\nspeedy remedy, to every person, for every injury of person, without delay.\n\n¶78    Thus, as a matter of federal constitutional law and Montana constitutional law,\n\nPlaintiffs are entitled to a prompt determination of their constitutional rights vis-à-vis the\n\nState of Montana’s admitted practice of making benefits and protections available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples while categorically denying them to same-sex couples.

No class of litigants should be burdened\n\nwith the emotional, financial, and time-related costs of this approach.         No class of\n\nlitigants should be treated in this draconian fashion.        Our decision today makes a\n\nmockery of this Court’s supposed commitment to access-to-justice principles.

In requiring Plaintiffs to jump through procedural\n\nhoops that we have never imposed on any other minority group, and in thus delaying the\n\nvindication of their constitutional rights, the Court conveys that gay, lesbian, and bisexual\n\nMontanans cannot expect to receive fairness, justice, respect, and equal treatment from\n\nMontana’s courts. As I said at the outset, this is a black day for civil rights in Montana.\n\n                                             46\n\f¶80    I now turn to a detailed discussion of the law supporting my conclusion that\n\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate here.\n\n                          III. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n\n¶81           Procedure should be the “handmaid of justice,” a means to\n              an end. Instead . . . procedure tends to become rigid,\n              stereotyped, and over-technical, an end in itself, often\n              seemingly oblivious to the practical needs of those to whose\n              ills it is designed to minister. Litigants thus often become\n              pawns in a game, the social cost of which is excessive and the\n              result of which is frequently unnecessarily cumbersome and\n              socially undesirable. Substantive rights often become the\n              incidents of procedural fencing. 4\n\n                                    A. Legal Principles\n\n¶82    The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act in 1922. The Act has been adopted, substantially as\n\ndrafted, in most states including Montana. See Unif. Declaratory Judms. Act, tbl. of jxns.\n\nand historical notes, 12 U.L.A. 331 (2008 & Supp. 2012); Mont. Code Ann., Annotations\n\n2012, at 1030; Title 27, chapter 8, MCA. The Act states that it is to be “so interpreted\n\nand construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states\n\nwhich enact it and to harmonize, as far as possible, with federal laws and regulations on\n\nthe subject of declaratory judgments and decrees.” Section 27-8-103, MCA. Thus, it is\n\nappropriate to consider decisions from other jurisdictions when applying the Act. See\n\ne.g. Beahringer v.

The declaration “may be either\n\naffirmative or negative in form and effect,” and it has “the force and effect of a final\n\njudgment or decree.” Section 27-8-201, MCA. The Act specifically provides that\n\n       [a]ny person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other\n       writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal\n       relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or\n       franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity\n       arising under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and\n       obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\n\nSection 27-8-202, MCA. The Act further provides, however, that this enumeration “does\n\nnot limit or restrict the exercise of the general powers conferred in 27-8-201 in any\n\nproceeding where declaratory relief is sought in which a judgment or decree will\n\nterminate the controversy or remove an uncertainty.” Section 27-8-205, MCA. The Act\n\n\n                                             49\n\f“is to be liberally construed and administered,” § 27-8-102, MCA, and “[n]o action or\n\nproceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree\n\nis prayed for,” § 27-8-201, MCA.\n\n¶86    Lastly, it is well settled that declaratory procedure is appropriate to determine a\n\nconstitutional question or to test a constitutional right.

The District Court’s Decision\n\n¶87    Given these principles, the District Court clearly had power “to declare [Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional] rights, status, and other legal relations”—whether or not further relief was\n\nor could be claimed—in order to “terminate the controversy” or “remove an uncertainty.”\n\nSections 27-8-201, -205, MCA. The District Court did not deny that it has this power; in\n\nfact, Plaintiffs reminded the District Court that it has this power in their motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment. The District Court, rather, simply failed to exercise it.\n\n¶88    At this juncture it is necessary to describe Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, which is\n\nattached as Appendix 2 to this Dissent. It consists of nine numbered paragraphs. The\n\nfirst five paragraphs seek declaratory relief—specifically, a “declaration” that the State’s\n\n                                              50\n\fcategorical exclusion of same-sex couples from the opportunity to obtain the protections\n\nand obligations which the State makes available to different-sex couples violates five\n\nseparate rights in the Montana Constitution. The next two paragraphs seek injunctive\n\nrelief: that the State be enjoined “from continuing to deny Plaintiffs and their families\n\naccess to a legal status and statutory structure that confers the protections and obligations\n\nthe State provides to different-sex couples who marry,” and that the State be required “to\n\noffer same-sex couples and their families a legal status and statutory structure that\n\nconfers the protections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples\n\nwho marry, but not the status or designation of marriage.” The final two paragraphs seek\n\ncosts, attorney’s fees, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper.\n\n¶89    Curiously, while five of the nine paragraphs in the Prayer for Relief seek\n\ndeclaratory relief, the District Court focused exclusively on the question of injunctive\n\nrelief. The court stated that “[t]he relief sought by Plaintiffs is contained in paragraph 7\n\nof their prayer for relief.” Paragraph 7 requests an order requiring the State to offer\n\nsame-sex couples and their families “a legal status and statutory structure that confers the\n\nprotections and obligations that the State provides to different-sex couples who marry,\n\nbut not the status or designation of marriage.” The District Court interpreted this to mean\n\nthat “Plaintiffs seek an order of this Court requiring the legislature to adopt a civil union\n\nor domestic partnership statutory scheme.”\n\n¶90    The District Court questioned whether the issuance of such an order would be an\n\nappropriate exercise of the court’s power. The District Court acknowledged that it has\n\npreviously been willing to exercise its judicial power when it found “a specific statute\n\n                                             51\n\fapplying to gay people” unconstitutional.         See Gryczan v. State, No. BDV-93-1869\n\n(Mont. 1st Jud. Dist.

See Columbia Falls Elem. Sch. Dist. v. State,\n\nNo. BDV-02-0528 (Mont. 1st Jud. Dist.

But the District Court viewed Columbia Falls as distinguishable from\n\nthe present case in that the court was dealing with “a discreet school funding formula”\n\nand “knew exactly what statutes would be affected” in the Columbia Falls case, whereas\n\nthe present case involves “a not yet entirely specified array of statutes that deal with\n\nmany different topics and were enacted over a variety of years.”\n\n¶92    The District Court thus reached “the jurisprudential decision that Plaintiffs’\n\nrequested relief constitutes an impermissible sojourn into the powers of the legislative\n\nbranch.” Citing “the constitutional separation of powers” (Mont. Const. art. III, § 1), the\n\nDistrict Court granted the Attorney General’s motion to dismiss. The District Court\n\n                                             52\n\fposited that the proper way to address Plaintiffs’ concerns would be through “specific\n\nsuits directed at specific, identifiable statutes.”\n\n¶93    With regard to the issue of injunctive relief, I do not fault Plaintiffs for including\n\nrequests for such relief in their complaint. It was their prerogative to do so. See Title 27,\n\nchapter 19, MCA. Likewise, however, I do not fault the District Court for declining to\n\norder injunctive relief at this stage. The District Court noted several factors which, in the\n\ncourt’s view, weighed against the issuance of a judicial order requiring the Legislature to\n\nenact the “statutory structure” requested by Plaintiffs. I cannot conclude that the District\n\nCourt abused its discretion in this regard. See Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v.

It bears repeating that the\n\nDistrict Court had “power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or\n\nnot further relief is or could be claimed.” Section 27-8-201, MCA (emphasis added).\n\nIndeed, “ ‘[a] declaratory judgment or decree is one which simply declares the rights of\n\nthe parties or expresses the opinion of the court on a question of law, without ordering\n\nanything to be done; its distinctive characteristic being that the declaration stands by\n\nitself, and no executory process follows as of course . . . .’ ” Black v.

The District Court had the power to issue a declaration if for no other reason than\n\n                                                53\n\fto “remove an uncertainty” regarding Plaintiffs’ rights. Section 27-8-205, MCA. Again,\n\nthe Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act “is to be liberally construed and administered,”\n\n§ 27-8-102, MCA, and “[n]o action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the\n\nground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for,” § 27-8-201, MCA. Thus, the\n\nfact that the District Court felt precluded from granting Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive\n\nrelief was not a valid legal basis for ignoring their requests for declaratory relief. These\n\nare distinct forms of relief, and a court’s ability to grant the latter does not depend in any\n\nway whatsoever on its ability to grant the former. Section 27-8-201, MCA.\n\n¶95    There is likewise no merit to the proposition that declaratory relief cannot be\n\ngranted without first identifying “all” of the statutes that would be affected by the ruling.\n\nFirst of all, as a factual matter, Plaintiffs provided the District Court with a list, appearing\n\nto be exhaustive, of the Montana statutes that confer benefits and protections on married\n\ncouples—benefits and protections that are unavailable to Plaintiffs because they cannot\n\nmarry. See Appendix 1 to this Dissent. The District Court thus had what it claimed it\n\nneeded: a list of “all of the statutes that would be affected” by the court’s ruling. Yet,\n\nrather than address Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory relief in light of this list—which\n\nPlaintiffs had provided at the District Court’s behest—the District Court inexplicably\n\ntook no action at all and thus caused their motion to alter or amend the judgment to be\n\ndenied by operation of law. See M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) (2009).\n\n¶96    Secondly, this same proposition—that declaratory relief cannot be granted without\n\nfirst identifying “all” of the statutes that would be affected by the ruling—was asserted,\n\nand rejected, in Spates v. Montgomery Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2391001\"><a href=\"/opinion/2391001/spates-v-montgomery-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1076 (Md. Spec. App. 1991).\n\n                                              54\n\fThere, the government argued that “by failing to identify particular statutes he regards as\n\nunconstitutional, Spates has not presented a justiciable issue.” Spates, 590 A.2d at 1077.\n\nThe Maryland Court of Special Appeals agreed that Spates’ complaint was “poorly drawn\n\nand seriously lacking in specifics.” Spates, 590 A.2d at 1077. Yet, the court observed\n\nthat Spates’ “basic point” was that the government’s failure to tax personal property\n\nplaced an unfair, disproportionate, and non-uniform tax burden on the owners of real\n\nproperty. Spates, 590 A.2d at 1077. From this, the court reasoned that\n\n       the failure to identify particular sections of the Tax-Property article of the\n       Code is really not telling in this case. Spates has challenged the system of\n       taxation authorized by law, which includes those sections defining terms,\n       imposing the property tax, determining the kinds of property to be taxed,\n       establishing the method of assessment, and providing for the collection of\n       the tax. Given the nature of his attack, it would, as he contends, be well-\n       nigh impossible, and quite unnecessary in our view, to pick through the\n       entire Tax Code and identify only those specific statutes or parts of statutes\n       that directly support the system he challenges.\n\nSpates, 590 A.2d at 1077.\n\n¶97    Plaintiffs’ challenge in the present case is not directed at Montana’s system of\n\ntaxation; it is directed at Montana’s system of statutory benefits and protections accorded\n\nto married couples. Nevertheless, Spates’ reasoning is pertinent here. Indeed, the fact\n\nthat the Legislature has spread the benefits and protections throughout the Code, rather\n\nthan collecting them all in a single title and chapter, cannot immunize the system from\n\nchallenge and review.\n\n¶98    The one feature common to each of the benefits and protections is that they are\n\ngranted to “spouses,” or on the basis of “marriage” to a “husband” or “wife.” Under\n\ncurrent Montana law, only heterosexuals and bisexuals in different-sex relationships can\n\n                                            55\n\fget “married” and thus become “spouses,” “husbands,” and “wives”; homosexuals and\n\nbisexuals in same-sex relationships are not allowed to marry. Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7;\n\n§§ 40-1-103, -401(1)(d), MCA; Black’s Law Dictionary 810, 1533, 1735 (spouse: “a\n\nmarried person”; husband: “[a] married man”; wife: “[a] married woman”). As a result,\n\nsame-sex couples are not encompassed within these benefits and protections. Plaintiffs\n\nchallenge this scheme as unconstitutional—i.e., the fact that the State systematically\n\ndenies them “the opportunity” to obtain the benefits and protections made available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples. Again, Plaintiffs do not ask to be married; they would be satisfied\n\nif “the opportunity” to obtain the benefits and protections were provided through some\n\nsort of alternative method distinct from “marriage.” Whether this claim implicates one\n\nstatute or a hundred, it is quite unnecessary for Plaintiffs to identify them all in this\n\nlawsuit in order to obtain a declaratory ruling. Paragraphs 1 through 5 of the Prayer for\n\nRelief seek only a “declaration” that this disparate treatment—the existence of which no\n\none disputes—violates the Montana Constitution. The District Court and this Court, in\n\nturn, may decree that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the opportunity to\n\nobtain the civil protections made available to different-sex couples, absent a compelling\n\nstate interest. Once that is done, the Legislature can identify the problem statutes and\n\namend them. Indeed, the Legislature did just that in 2009 when it passed House Bill 37,\n\ntitled “An Act Gender Neutralizing and Conforming Titles 10 through 90 of the Montana\n\nCode Annotated to Current Bill Drafting Standards . . . .” This single piece of legislation,\n\nthe text of which spans 967 pages of the 2009 Session Laws, simultaneously amended\n\n2,876 statutes. Surely if the Legislature can identify several thousand statutes needing to\n\n                                            56\n\fbe “gender neutralized,” the Legislature can identify a few hundred statutes needing to be\n\n“sexual-orientation neutralized.”\n\n¶99    We have said that “[t]he decision to dismiss a complaint for declaratory relief is\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the district court.” Renville v.

Spates, 590 A.2d at 1076 (“Having failed to find a legitimate reason not to\n\ndeclare the rights of the parties, it was incumbent upon the court to do so.”). That is what\n\nhappened here when the District Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ complaint based on their\n\nrequested injunctive relief, without addressing their requested declaratory relief. In so\n\ndoing, the District Court wrongly conflated these two forms of relief. The District Court\n\nfailed to recognize that one of the purposes of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is\n\n“[t]o enable public duties and powers to be established without the cumbersome and\n\ntechnical prerequisites of mandamus, certiorari, injunction, prohibition, or habeas\n\ncorpus.” Edwin Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 288 (2d ed. 1941). The District Court\n\noverlooked the fact that while a motion to dismiss may be used in a declaratory judgment\n\nproceeding “to challenge the legal availability or appropriateness of the remedy,” a\n\nmotion to dismiss should “seldom, if ever, . . . be sustained or the complaint dismissed\n\nwithout a declaration one way or the other of the rights of the parties.” Spates, 590 A.2d\n\nat 1076 (emphases added, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); cf.

Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice vol. 2, § 12.34[1][b],\n\n12-81 (3d ed., Matthew Bender 2012) (“Consistently with their obligation to construe\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations liberally, courts will not dismiss for failure to state a claim merely\n\nbecause the complaint requests inappropriate relief.”).\n\n¶100 I am thus in complete agreement with Plaintiffs’ statement, in their motion to alter\n\nor amend the judgment, that “dismissal of the entire action based solely on one request\n\nfor injunctive relief reflects a manifest error of law as there are five other requests for\n\ndeclaratory judgment upon which this Court may properly rule.” The District Court\n\nerred, as a matter of law, in its treatment of Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief, and\n\nthe District Court’s judgment must therefore be reversed to that extent.\n\n                       C. This Court’s “Justiciability” Rationale\n\n¶101 Like the District Court, this Court also lumps Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive\n\nrelief and declaratory relief into a single analysis. Opinion, ¶ 9. Doing so is error for the\n\nreasons just discussed. The Court does appear, however, to reject Plaintiffs’ claims using\n\na somewhat different rationale.      Specifically, the Court asserts that this case is not\n\n“justiciable” because a ruling in Plaintiffs’ favor “would not terminate the uncertainty or\n\ncontroversy giving rise to this proceeding” and because Plaintiffs are asking this Court to\n\n“determine speculative matters,” “declare social status,” “give advisory opinions,” or\n\n“give abstract opinions.” Opinion, ¶ 9. In all respects, the Court is mistaken.\n\n\n\n                                             58\n\f¶102 First of all, a declaratory judgment is itself “remedial.” Section 27-8-102, MCA.\n\nA declaratory judgment or decree is one which simply declares the rights of the parties or\n\nexpresses the opinion of the court on a question of law, without ordering anything to be\n\ndone; the declaration stands by itself, and no executory process follows as of course.\n\nBlack, 392 P.2d at 574; Clein, 40 S.E.2d at 137; § 27-8-201, MCA. The Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act permits courts “to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty\n\nand insecurity.” Section 27-8-102, MCA. A declaratory judgment is appropriate if for\n\nno other reason than to “remove an uncertainty.” Section 27-8-205, MCA.\n\n¶103 The Court’s contention that a declaratory judgment would not terminate the\n\nuncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding is simply untrue. There is no\n\ndispute that the State offers a variety of benefits and protections to committed intimate\n\ncouples, but only different-sex couples have the opportunity to obtain them. This regime\n\ngives preferential treatment to heterosexuals and bisexuals committed to a person of the\n\nopposite sex, and disfavors homosexuals and bisexuals committed to a person of the same\n\nsex.   Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory relief raise one legal question:         Is it\n\nconstitutionally permissible for the State to deny same-sex couples the opportunity to\n\nobtain the benefits and protections made available to different-sex couples? In other\n\nwords, is it constitutionally permissible for Montana’s government to treat Plaintiffs\n\ndifferently based on their sexual orientation? That is the “uncertainty or controversy” in\n\nthis case. We may resolve it—and, for the reasons detailed in the Constitutional Analysis\n\nsection below, I would resolve it—by holding that sexual orientation is a suspect class\n\nand that any disparate treatment between committed intimate same-sex couples and\n\n                                           59\n\fdifferent-sex married couples is subject to “strict scrutiny” review. Such a ruling would\n\nanswer and resolve Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory relief.\n\n¶104 Secondly, there is no merit to the Court’s suggestion that Plaintiffs have asked us\n\nto determine speculative matters, declare social status, or give an abstract opinion. This\n\ndismissive portrayal of Plaintiffs’ complaint is insulting and disrespectful. There is\n\nnothing “speculative” about the discrimination Plaintiffs have experienced—some of it\n\nprivate, some of it state-imposed—as described in their affidavits. The State itself does\n\nnot deny that Plaintiffs have suffered economic and emotional harm due to their sexual\n\norientation and that Plaintiffs’ relationships are treated differently than their different-sex\n\ncounterparts under the law. Plaintiffs do not ask or need this Court to declare their\n\n“social status.” Plaintiffs are acutely aware of their social status. They ask this Court,\n\nrather, to declare and uphold their constitutional rights. There is nothing “speculative” or\n\n“abstract” about this claim.\n\n¶105 Lastly, we have previously defined nonjusticiable advisory opinions as “opinions\n\nissued by the court in response to a request from some other branch of government, such\n\nas the legislative or executive, asking for information concerning matters of law.” In re\n\nSecret Grand Jury Inquiry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"876244\"><a href=\"/opinion/876244/matter-of-secret-grand-jury-inquiry/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 990 (1976). That clearly\n\nis not the case here. More recently, we have stated that an advisory opinion is “one\n\nadvising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts or upon an abstract\n\nproposition.” Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Regl. Airport Auth. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889540\"><a href=\"/opinion/889540/plan-helena-v-helena-airport-authority-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 12,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889540\"><a href=\"/opinion/889540/plan-helena-v-helena-airport-authority-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889540\"><a href=\"/opinion/889540/plan-helena-v-helena-airport-authority-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. That too is not the case here. The underlying state of facts\n\nis not “hypothetical,” nor is the proposition “abstract.” Plaintiffs are being denied access\n\n                                              60\n\fto statutory benefits and protections which the State, in its discretion, has chosen to make\n\navailable to different-sex couples.\n\n¶106 In Secret Grand Jury Inquiry, this Court articulated what constitutes a “justiciable\n\ncontroversy” for purposes of obtaining a declaratory judgment:\n\n       First, a justiciable controversy requires that parties have existing and\n       genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interests. Second, the\n       controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may\n       effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate or argument invoking a\n       purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion.\n       Third, it must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will\n       have the effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the\n       rights, status or legal relationships of one or more of the real parties in\n       interest, or lacking these qualities be of such an overriding public moment\n       as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them.\n\n170 Mont. at 357, 553 P.2d at 990.\n\n¶107 We have repeated this test in numerous cases, 5 and recently applied the test in\n\nChipman v.

Opinion, ¶ 13. But even assuming, for the sake of\n\nargument, that the nature of the State’s interest in excluding same-sex couples varies\n\nfrom statute to statute, the present action can definitively settle the nature of Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional rights—rights that are the same regardless of the statute at issue. There is\n\nno indication, therefore, that a declaration here would be “purely political, administrative,\n\nphilosophical or academic.” Chipman, ¶ 22. Finally, in considering “the main thrust” of\n\nthis lawsuit, Chipman, ¶ 23, this Court has been asked to determine the constitutional\n\nrelationship of the parties. In particular, we must determine whether the Constitution\n\nrequires that when the State offers legal benefits and protections to persons in committed\n\nintimate relationships, it must do so evenhandedly, without discriminating on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation.   This controversy directly involves the rights, status, and legal\n\nrelationships of the parties. Chipman, ¶ 23; see also Plan Helena, ¶ 9 (the controversy\n\nmust be “definite and concrete, touching legal relations of parties having adverse legal\n\ninterests” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, it is a justiciable controversy\n\nunder the foregoing three-part test.\n\n                                       D. Summary\n\n¶108 In sum, the Court errs in holding that this case is nonjusticiable. In adopting its\n\nstatute-by-statute approach, the Court not only fails to follow Montana’s own statutory\n\ncommands, but also sets itself apart as the non-uniform black sheep in the otherwise\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act states.\n\n                                             62\n\f¶109 Courts have “power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or\n\nnot further relief is or could be claimed.” Section 27-8-201, MCA. This power “is to be\n\nliberally construed and administered” to permit courts “to settle and to afford relief from\n\nuncertainty and insecurity.”     Section 27-8-102, -205, MCA.          Through a declaratory\n\njudgment proceeding, “a multiplicity of suits can be avoided, while an adequate,\n\nexpedient, and inexpensive remedy can be afforded for litigants in a single action.”\n\nThomas v. Cilbe, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1714730\"><a href=\"/opinion/1714730/thomas-v-cilbe-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403 (Fla. App. 1958).\n\n¶110 Here, the declaratory issue is whether the Montana Constitution prohibits the State\n\nfrom excluding same-sex partners from the opportunity to obtain the benefits and\n\nprotections that the State makes available to different-sex partners. There is no need to\n\nidentify “all” of the potentially offending statutes in order to issue a ruling on this legal\n\nquestion, nor is there a need to pursue each statutory challenge separately. It is sufficient\n\nto declare the constitutional standard applicable to Plaintiffs’ claim—an issue which\n\nPlaintiffs have raised and briefed. And for the reasons discussed below, I would hold that\n\nsexual orientation is a suspect class under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana\n\nConstitution and that discrimination based on sexual orientation in the provision of\n\nstatutory benefits and protections is subject to “strict scrutiny” review. I would reverse\n\nthe District Court’s judgment and direct it to enter such an order. I dissent from this\n\nCourt’s failure and refusal to do so.\n\n¶111 As for the injunctions Plaintiffs request, I do not believe it is necessary to order\n\nsuch relief at this point. It is sufficient to declare Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights so as to\n\nremove the apparent uncertainty concerning those rights. Sections 27-8-201, -205, MCA.\n\n                                               63\n\fRather than proceed to direct the State how to remedy the problem, it is prudent to do\n\nwhat was done in the Columbia Falls and Snetsinger cases and permit the legislative and\n\nexecutive branches to address and resolve the matter in the first instance, in accordance\n\nwith our constitutional interpretation, as those officers are sworn to do (Mont. Const.\n\nart. III, § 3). See Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 279-80 (“The declaratory action\n\nproceeds on the assumption that a mild remedy will often satisfy, that responsible\n\ndefendants, like government officials or large corporations, do not need more than a\n\ndeclaration of the law to obey it and that a coercive procedure under such circumstances\n\nis an expensive and often unnecessary luxury.”). Indeed, this is exactly what happened\n\nfollowing our decision in Snetsinger, where we concluded that the Montana University\n\nSystem’s policy of treating unmarried same-sex couples differently than unmarried\n\ndifferent-sex couples in the provision of health benefits violated the Montana\n\nConstitution. Within three months, the Board of Regents had approved—unanimously,\n\nno less—a new insurance policy that would allow University System employees to obtain\n\nhealth coverage for gay and lesbian partners. See Regents Approve Same-Sex Insurance\n\nPolicy, Missoulian (Mar. 18, 2005).\n\n¶112 Plaintiffs here contend that entering a declaratory judgment regarding their\n\nconstitutional rights “would serve the courts’ primary function of adjudicating citizens’\n\nrights under the Constitution, while allowing the coordinate branches of government a\n\nreasonable opportunity to bring the State’s conduct into compliance with the\n\nConstitution.” I agree and, thus, would affirm the District Court’s denial of injunctive\n\nrelief, with the understanding that Plaintiffs may again pursue such relief if it becomes\n\n                                           64\n\fnecessary in the future to do so. See e.g. Baker v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 886, 887 (Vt.\n\n1999) (“We hold only that plaintiffs are entitled under Chapter I, Article 7, of the\n\nVermont Constitution to obtain the same benefits and protections afforded by Vermont\n\nlaw to married opposite-sex couples. We do not purport to infringe upon the prerogatives\n\nof the Legislature to craft an appropriate means of addressing this constitutional mandate\n\n. . . . In the event that the benefits and protections in question are not statutorily granted,\n\nplaintiffs may petition this Court to order the remedy they originally sought.”).\n\n¶113 Having detailed my reasons for disagreeing with the District Court’s and this\n\nCourt’s procedural dispositions of the case, I now provide the legal analysis underlying\n\nmy conclusions that sexual orientation is a suspect class and, thus, that treating same-sex\n\ncouples differently than different-sex couples is subject to strict scrutiny review.\n\n                         IV. CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS\n\n¶114          [I]n view of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in\n              this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens.\n              There is no caste here. Our Constitution . . . neither knows\n              nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil\n              rights, all citizens are equal before the law. 6\n\n¶115 Plaintiffs contend that the State’s exclusion of same-sex couples from the\n\nopportunity to obtain the benefits and protections which the State makes available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples violates five fundamental constitutional rights: to pursue safety,\n\nhealth, and happiness (Mont. Const. art. II, § 3), to equal protection of the laws (§ 4), to\n\nindividual dignity (§ 4), to individual privacy (§ 10), and to due process of law (§ 17).\n\n\n       6\n         Plessy v.

At the conclusion of\n\nmy equal protection discussion, however, I briefly discuss Article II, Section 4’s Dignity\n\nClause and the additional support it provides for Plaintiffs’ claim.\n\n                       A.

As\n\naptly stated by the United States Supreme Court,\n\n       for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual\n       conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious\n       beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the\n       traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but\n       profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to\n       which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These\n       considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is\n       whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views\n       on the whole society through operation of [its] law[s].

Classification and “Similarly Situated” Analysis\n\n¶125 As discussed, the State grants various benefits and obligations to married persons,\n\nwhich is accomplished through the use of such terms as “husband,” “wife,” “spouse,” or\n\n“married” in the various statutes. 7 The State contends, therefore, that the statutes create\n\n“a marital classification.” In the State’s view, “[t]he different classes involved here are\n\nmarried couples, who by definition are capable of receiving spousal benefits, and\n\n       7\n           See e.g. § 15-61-102(3), MCA (“ ‘Dependent’ means the spouse of the employee\nor account holder . . . .”); § 19-6-505(2), MCA (“Upon the retired member’s death, the\nretirement benefit must be paid to the member’s surviving spouse, if there is one.”);\n§ 27-1-515, MCA (“The rights of personal relations forbid . . . the abduction or\nenticement of a wife from the wife’s husband or a husband from the husband’s wife\n. . . .”); § 39-71-116(4), MCA (“ ‘Beneficiary’ means . . . a surviving spouse living with\nor legally entitled to be supported by the deceased at the time of injury . . . .”);\n§ 40-2-102, MCA (“Insofar as each is able, the husband and wife shall support each other\nout of their property and labor.”); § 40-2-108, MCA (“A married person may be a\npersonal representative, guardian, conservator, or trustee and may personally be bound\nand may bind the estate the person represents without any act or assent on the part of the\nperson’s spouse.”); § 50-9-106(2), MCA (“The authority to consent or to withhold\nconsent under subsection (1) may be exercised by the following individuals, in order of\npriority: (a) the spouse of the individual . . . .”); § 72-2-412, MCA (“A decedent’s\nsurviving spouse is entitled to a homestead allowance of $20,000.”).\n                                            72\n\funmarried couples, who by definition are not capable of receiving spousal benefits.” The\n\nState further argues that married couples and unmarried couples are not similarly situated\n\nbecause married couples are formally recognized under the law and unmarried couples\n\nare not. Thus, the State concludes that Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim must fail. One\n\nof the State’s amici (Montana Family Foundation) similarly argues that Plaintiffs’ claim\n\nfails because “all unmarried couples are treated alike under Montana law.”\n\n¶126 These arguments are incorrect—both in identifying the pertinent classification and\n\nin applying the “similarly situated” concept. It is true that the statutes, on their face,\n\nclassify based on marital status. But, as we have recognized, it is sometimes necessary to\n\nlook beyond the face of a classification in order to ascertain the true distinction being\n\ndrawn. In Bankers Life & Cas. Co. v. Peterson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"882654\"><a href=\"/opinion/882654/bankers-life-casualty-v-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), for\n\nexample, this Court did not treat “normal pregnancy and childbirth” as a classification\n\nbetween pregnant persons and non-pregnant persons—the approach the State argues here.\n\nRather, we recognized that distinctions based on pregnancy are, in reality, sex-linked\n\nclassifications. “[A]ny classification which relies on pregnancy as the determinative\n\ncriterion is a distinction based on sex” because “it is the capacity to become pregnant\n\nwhich primarily differentiates the female from the male.” Bankers Life, 263 Mont. at\n\n160, 866 P.2d at 243 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶127 Likewise here, only different-sex couples have the capacity under current Montana\n\nlaw to get “married” and thereby become “spouses,” “husbands,” and “wives.” Same-sex\n\ncouples are not permitted to marry and are thus categorically excluded from the statutory\n\nbenefits and obligations granted to spouses, husbands, and wives. Mont. Const. art. XIII,\n\n                                           73\n\f§ 7; §§ 40-1-103, -401(1)(d), MCA; Black’s Law Dictionary 810, 1533, 1735 (spouse: a\n\nmarried person; husband: a married man; wife: a married woman). Different-sex\n\ncouples may obtain all of the benefits and obligations—by getting married. Same-sex\n\ncouples may not obtain any of the benefits and obligations—because they cannot get\n\nmarried. Thus, while the classification may appear on its face to be marital status, the\n\nstatutory definition of “spouse” is “[i]nherent” in this classification. Snetsinger, ¶ 20.\n\nAnd because marital status, by definition, is available only to different-sex couples, the\n\npertinent classification is sexual orientation.    Snetsinger, ¶ 27 (holding that sexual\n\norientation, not marital status, is “the defining difference” where “unmarried opposite-sex\n\ncouples are able to avail themselves of health benefits under the University System’s\n\npolicy while unmarried same-sex couples are denied the health benefits”).\n\n¶128 Indeed, if the State limited marriage to Caucasians, and then granted an array of\n\nstatutory benefits to such married couples, it would be ludicrous to argue—as the State\n\ndoes here—that “married couples qualify for spousal benefits not because they are\n\n[Caucasian] but because they are spouses.” This statement is simply wrong. Being\n\nCaucasian is, in fact, a prerequisite to qualifying for the benefits in this example, just as\n\nbeing heterosexual (or bisexual and committed to someone of the opposite sex) is a\n\nprerequisite to qualifying for the benefits in the present case. By granting benefits in a\n\nseemingly benign fashion to “spouses,” but then defining “spouses” to include only\n\nCaucasians, the relevant classification is race, not marital status. If the State limited the\n\nmeaning of “spouse” to Catholics, the classification would be religious affiliation. And\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\fby defining “spouse” to mean a member of a different-sex couple, the statutory scheme\n\ncreates a classification based on sexual orientation.\n\n¶129 It is perplexing that the State is even making the contrary argument, given the\n\nmultitude of courts that have already rejected it. In Tanner v. Oregon Health Sci. U., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1419970\"><a href=\"/opinion/1419970/tanner-v-ohsu/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Or. App. 1998), for example, the governmental defendant argued that the\n\nbenefits at issue were “available to all on equal terms” because “[a]ll married\n\nemployees—heterosexual and homosexual alike—are permitted to acquire insurance\n\nbenefits for their spouses.” 971 P.2d at 447-48 (emphasis omitted). As the Oregon Court\n\nof Appeals observed, such reasoning “misses the point”: “Homosexual couples may not\n\nmarry. Accordingly, the benefits are not made available on equal terms. They are made\n\navailable on terms that, for gay and lesbian couples, are a legal impossibility.” Tanner,\n\n971 P.2d at 448. Similarly, the governmental defendants in Alaska Civ. Liberties Union\n\nargued that their programs differentiated on the basis of marital status, not sexual\n\norientation. The Alaska Supreme Court, however, concluded otherwise:\n\n              We agree with the plaintiffs that the proper comparison is between\n       same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples, whether or not they are\n       married. The municipality correctly observes that no unmarried employees,\n       whether they are members of same-sex or opposite-sex couples, can obtain\n       the disputed benefits for their domestic partners. But this does not mean\n       that these programs treat same-sex and opposite-sex couples the same.\n       Unmarried public employees in opposite-sex domestic relationships have\n       the opportunity to obtain these benefits, because employees are not\n       prevented by law from marrying their opposite-sex domestic partners. In\n       comparison, public employees in committed same-sex relationships are\n       absolutely denied any opportunity to obtain these benefits, because these\n       employees are barred by law from marrying their same-sex partners in\n       Alaska or having any marriage performed elsewhere recognized in Alaska.\n       Same-sex unmarried couples therefore have no way of obtaining these\n       benefits, whereas opposite-sex unmarried couples may become eligible for\n\n                                             75\n\f       them by marrying. The programs consequently treat same-sex couples\n       differently from opposite-sex couples.\n\nAlaska Civ. Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 788; accord Collins v.

Under such circumstances, Texas’ sodomy law is targeted at more than\n\nconduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class.”).\n\n¶130 One of the fallacies in the State’s approach is that it denies the most fundamental\n\nand defining aspect of same-sex relationships. The State contends that “[l]aws granting\n\nspousal benefits do not discriminate against gays and lesbians any more than they\n\ndiscriminate against . . . other couples that may desire spousal benefits but do not qualify\n\nas spouses.” In other words, the State asserts, Plaintiffs “are situated no differently than\n\nunmarried different-sex partners.” Yet, as discussed above, different-sex partners may\n\nget married. And the State’s implication that Plaintiffs may do the same—albeit, to\n\nsomeone of the opposite sex—is absurd. As the California Supreme Court explained:\n\n       By limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, the marriage statutes,\n       realistically viewed, operate clearly and directly to impose different\n       treatment on gay individuals because of their sexual orientation. By\n       definition, gay individuals are persons who are sexually attracted to persons\n\n                                             76\n\f       of the same sex and thus, if inclined to enter into a marriage relationship,\n       would choose to marry a person of their own sex or gender. A statute that\n       limits marriage to a union of persons of opposite sexes, thereby placing\n       marriage outside the reach of couples of the same sex, unquestionably\n       imposes different treatment on the basis of sexual orientation. In our view,\n       it is sophistic to suggest that this conclusion is avoidable by reason of the\n       circumstance that the marriage statutes permit a gay man or a lesbian to\n       marry someone of the opposite sex, because making such a choice would\n       require the negation of the person’s sexual orientation. Just as a statute\n       that restricted marriage only to couples of the same sex would discriminate\n       against heterosexual persons on the basis of their heterosexual orientation,\n       the current California statutes realistically must be viewed as discriminating\n       against gay persons on the basis of their homosexual orientation.\n\nIn re Marriage Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440-41 (Cal. 2008) (emphasis added, footnote\n\nomitted). It should be noted that people have a constitutionally protected right under the\n\n“liberty” component of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and under the\n\n“privacy” provision of the Montana Constitution to choose a personal intimate\n\nrelationship with someone of the same sex. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 567, 123 S. Ct. at\n\n2478; Gryczan, 283 Mont. at 455-56, 942 P.2d at 125-26. It is not the State’s prerogative\n\nto prohibit such relationships. Nor, however, may the State seek to accomplish the same\n\nresult through coercive measures—such as by denying homosexuals and bisexuals the\n\nequal protection of the State’s secular laws when these individuals choose a partner of the\n\nsame sex, rather than one of the opposite sex.\n\n¶131 Another fallacy in the State’s argument is the mistaken perception that “similarly\n\nsituated” means “similar in the possession of the classifying trait.” When the government\n\ncreates a particular classification, there of course will be some who fall within that class\n\nand some who fall outside of it. It is incorrect to say, however, as the State does here,\n\nthat these two groups are not “similarly situated” because of the classification itself.\n\n                                            77\n\fSuch circular reasoning would effectively immunize every classification against equal\n\nprotection challenge. The Iowa Supreme Court discussed this point in Varnum:\n\n               In considering whether two classes are similarly situated, a court\n       cannot simply look at the trait used by the legislature to define a\n       classification under a statute and conclude a person without that trait is not\n       similarly situated to persons with the trait. The equal protection clause\n       does not merely ensure the challenged statute applies equally to all people\n       in the legislative classification. “Similarly situated” cannot mean simply\n       “similar in the possession of the classifying trait.” All members of any\n       class are similarly situated in this respect and consequently, any\n       classification whatsoever would be reasonable by this test. In the same\n       way, the similarly situated requirement cannot possibly be interpreted to\n       require plaintiffs to be identical in every way to people treated more\n       favorably by the law. No two people or groups of people are the same in\n       every way, and nearly every equal protection claim could be run aground\n       onto the shoals of a threshold analysis if the two groups needed to be a\n       mirror image of one another. Such a threshold analysis would hollow out\n       the constitution’s promise of equal protection.\n\n763 N.W.2d at 882-83 (citations, brackets, and some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶132 Having discussed the fallacies of the State’s approach, I turn to a proper “similarly\n\nsituated” analysis. Again, whether two classes are similarly situated depends on whether\n\nthey are roughly equivalent in all relevant respects besides the classifying trait adopted by\n\nthe State. Tapalian, 377 F.3d at 6; Aguilar, 883 F.2d at 706. The inquiry is not whether\n\npersons are similarly situated for all purposes, but whether they are similarly situated for\n\npurposes of the law challenged. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 422; accord Varnum, 763 N.W.2d\n\nat 883 (“the equal protection guarantee requires that laws treat all those who are similarly\n\nsituated with respect to the purposes of the law alike” (emphasis in original)).\n\n¶133 In Snetsinger, ¶ 27, this Court concluded that unmarried different-sex couples and\n\nunmarried same-sex couples, “although similarly situated in all respects other than sexual\n\n\n                                             78\n\forientation,” were not being treated “equally and fairly” because the former group had the\n\nability to obtain the health benefits provided by the Montana University System and the\n\nlatter group did not. That conclusion is on point here: unmarried different-sex couples\n\nare able to obtain the various benefits provided by the State, while unmarried same-sex\n\ncouples are not able to obtain those benefits. Although the Court in Snetsinger did not\n\ndiscuss its conclusion on the “similarly situated” requirement in much detail, a number of\n\nother courts have provided persuasive analyses on this point.\n\n¶134 The Iowa Supreme Court, for example, concluded in Varnum that “for purposes of\n\nIowa’s marriage laws, which are designed to bring a sense of order to the legal\n\nrelationships of committed couples and their families in myriad ways,” the plaintiffs (six\n\nsame-sex couples) “are similarly situated compared to heterosexual persons” “in every\n\nimportant respect, but for their sexual orientation.” 763 N.W.2d at 883-84.\n\n      Plaintiffs are in committed and loving relationships, many raising families,\n      just like heterosexual couples. Moreover, official recognition of their status\n      provides an institutional basis for defining their fundamental relational\n      rights and responsibilities, just as it does for heterosexual couples. Society\n      benefits, for example, from providing same-sex couples a stable framework\n      within which to raise their children and the power to make health care and\n      end-of-life decisions for loved ones, just as it does when that framework is\n      provided for opposite-sex couples.\n\nVarnum, 763 N.W.2d at 883.\n\n¶135 The Connecticut Supreme Court likewise determined that the plaintiffs there (eight\n\nsame-sex couples) “share the same interest in a committed and loving relationship as\n\nheterosexual persons who wish to marry, and they share the same interest in having a\n\nfamily and raising their children in a loving and supportive environment.” Kerrigan, 957\n\n\n                                            79\n\fA.2d at 424.    The court noted that the plaintiffs met the same statutory eligibility\n\nrequirements applicable to persons who seek to marry, including restrictions related to\n\npublic safety, such as age and consanguinity. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 424.\n\n¶136 Addressing this question, the California Supreme Court observed that\n\n      [b]oth groups at issue consist of pairs of individuals who wish to enter into\n      a formal, legally binding and officially recognized, long-term family\n      relationship that affords the same rights and privileges and imposes the\n      same obligations and responsibilities. Under these circumstances, there is\n      no question but that these two categories of individuals are sufficiently\n      similar . . . .\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 435 n. 54 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶137 In Baker, the principal purpose the government advanced in support of excluding\n\nsame-sex couples from the legal benefits of marriage was the interest in “ ‘furthering the\n\nlink between procreation and child rearing.’ ” 744 A.2d at 881. The Vermont Supreme\n\nCourt agreed that “the State has a legitimate and long-standing interest in promoting a\n\npermanent commitment between couples for the security of their children” and that “the\n\nState’s interest has been advanced by extending formal public sanction and protection to\n\nthe union, or marriage, of those couples considered capable of having children.” Baker,\n\n744 A.2d at 881. The court further observed, however, “that a significant number of\n\nchildren today are actually being raised by same-sex parents, and that increasing numbers\n\nof children are being conceived by such parents through a variety of assisted-reproductive\n\ntechniques.” Baker, 744 A.2d at 881. The court reasoned, therefore,\n\n      to the extent that the state’s purpose in licensing civil marriage was, and is,\n      to legitimize children and provide for their security, the statutes plainly\n      exclude many same-sex couples who are no different from opposite-sex\n      couples with respect to these objectives. If anything, the exclusion of\n\n                                            80\n\f      same-sex couples from the legal protections incident to marriage exposes\n      their children to the precise risks that the State argues the marriage laws are\n      designed to secure against. In short, the marital exclusion treats persons\n      who are similarly situated for purposes of the law, differently.\n\nBaker, 744 A.2d at 882 (emphases in original).\n\n¶138 Perry v. Schwarzenegger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440578\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440578/perry-v-schwarzenegger/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Cal. 2010), involved a\n\nconstitutional challenge to Proposition 8, which amended California’s Constitution to\n\nrestrict marriage to one man and one woman. The federal district court held a bench trial\n\nduring which it heard lay and expert testimony on various issues, including whether\n\nsame-sex couples are inferior to or materially distinct from different-sex couples. The\n\nfederal district court’s decision is discussed in greater detail below in the Marriage\n\nAmendment section. See ¶¶ 183-189, infra. For purposes of the present discussion, it is\n\nsufficient to note the following testimony and factual findings made by the court:\n\n      • “Gay and lesbian sexual orientations are ‘normal variation[s] and are considered\n        to be aspects of well-adjusted behavior.’ ”\n\n      • “Homosexuality is not considered a mental disorder. . . . [M]ajor professional\n        mental health associations have all gone on record affirming that homosexuality\n        is a normal expression of sexuality and that it is not in any way a form of\n        pathology.”\n\n      • “ ‘Courts and legal scholars have concluded that sexual orientation is not related\n        to an individual’s ability to contribute to society or perform in the workplace.’ ”\n\n      • “Same-sex couples are identical to opposite-sex couples in the characteristics\n        relevant to the ability to form successful marital unions. Like opposite-sex\n        couples, same-sex couples have happy, satisfying relationships and form deep\n        emotional bonds and strong commitments to their partners. Standardized\n        measures of relationship satisfaction, relationship adjustment and love do not\n        differ depending on whether a couple is same-sex or opposite-sex.”\n\n      • “Same-sex couples receive the same tangible and intangible benefits from\n        marriage that opposite-sex couples receive,” including “greater commitment to\n\n                                            81\n\f        the relationship, more acceptance from extended family, less worry over legal\n        problems, [and] greater access to health benefits and benefits for their children.”\n\n       • “The sexual orientation of an individual does not determine whether that\n         individual can be a good parent. Children raised by gay or lesbian parents are as\n         likely as children raised by heterosexual parents to be healthy, successful and\n         well-adjusted. The research supporting this conclusion is accepted beyond\n         serious debate in the field of developmental psychology.”\n\n       • “The evidence shows that, by every available metric, opposite-sex couples are\n         not better than their same-sex counterparts; instead, as partners, parents and\n         citizens, opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples are equal.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 967, 969, 980, 1002.\n\n¶139 These findings are consistent with the record in the present case. Plaintiffs filed\n\nthe affidavit of Dr. Letitia Anne Peplau, a psychologist, who states: “Research clearly\n\nestablishes that same-sex couples closely resemble heterosexual couples both in terms of\n\nthe quality of their relationship and the processes that affect their relationships.” The\n\nState does not deny this. Plaintiffs also filed the affidavit of Dr. Suzanne D. Dixon, a\n\nbehavioral and developmental pediatrician, who states: “Children raised by same-sex\n\nparents are just as likely to be psychologically, emotionally, socially and sexually well\n\nadjusted as those raised by heterosexual parents. Being parented by gay, lesbian or\n\nbisexual parents has no adverse impact on the behavior and development of children.”\n\nThe State does not deny this either. In fact, the State does not deny that Plaintiffs are\n\nsimilarly situated to different-sex couples in every respect other than the ability to obtain\n\nthe secular benefits and obligations at issue here by getting married.\n\n¶140 I agree with the Iowa Supreme Court that the benefits and responsibilities granted\n\nby the State to married persons “are designed to bring a sense of order to the legal\n\n\n                                             82\n\frelationships of committed couples and their families in myriad ways”—for example, by\n\nproviding a stable framework within which to raise children and the power to make\n\nhealthcare decisions for loved ones. Varnum 763 N.W.2d at 883-84. Plaintiffs indicate\n\nin their affidavits that they share the same interest as different-sex couples in protecting\n\ntheir relationships, their families, and their children. Except for the fact that one partner\n\nis the same sex as the other, Plaintiffs’ committed intimate relationships are materially\n\nindistinguishable from different-sex committed intimate relationships.\n\n¶141 Based on these undisputed facts and the foregoing discussion, I conclude and\n\nwould hold that the pertinent classification here is sexual orientation. I further conclude\n\nand would hold that Plaintiffs are similarly situated to, but treated differently than,\n\ndifferent-sex couples vis-à-vis the benefits and responsibilities afforded by the State to\n\nmarried persons. I now turn to the question of the appropriate level of scrutiny.\n\n                                   E. Level of Scrutiny\n\n¶142 As noted above, if a law neither burdens a constitutional right nor targets a suspect\n\nor quasi-suspect class, then the courts will uphold the legislative classification so long as\n\nit bears a rational relationship to some legitimate governmental objective. But if the law\n\ndisadvantages a suspect or quasi-suspect class or impinges upon the exercise of a\n\nconstitutional right, then the classification is subject to heightened scrutiny. See Romer,\n\n517 U.S. at 631, 116 S. Ct. at 1627; Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440-41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254-55;\n\nSnetsinger, ¶¶ 17-19.\n\n¶143 In Snetsinger, this Court concluded that the Montana University System’s policy\n\nof allowing unmarried different-sex couples to avail themselves of the health benefits\n\n                                             83\n\foffered under the University System’s group health insurance plan, while denying\n\nunmarried same-sex couples the ability to obtain these same benefits, failed even the\n\nmost deferential standard of review: “there is no justification for treating the two groups\n\ndifferently, nor is the University System’s policy rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest.” Snetsinger, ¶ 27.\n\n¶144 In the present case, Plaintiffs likewise argue that the State’s exclusion of same-sex\n\ncouples from the opportunity to obtain the benefits and protections which the State makes\n\navailable to different-sex couples fails rational basis review. Plaintiffs further argue,\n\nhowever, that “sexual orientation should be considered a suspect classification under\n\nMontana law” and that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is therefore\n\nsubject to “strict scrutiny.” For purposes of resolving Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory\n\nrelief, and for the reasons which follow, I agree that sexual orientation is a suspect class\n\nand that treating same-sex couples differently than different-sex couples is thus subject to\n\nstrict scrutiny review.\n\n¶145 Courts have identified four factors or indicia as bearing on whether a class is\n\nsuspect or quasi-suspect (thus warranting a more exacting constitutional analysis of the\n\nlegislative classification than that provided by rational basis review).         They are\n\n(1) whether the class has historically been subjected to discrimination; (2) whether the\n\ncharacteristics that distinguish the class indicate a typical class member’s ability to\n\nperform or contribute to society; (3) whether the distinguishing characteristic is\n\nimmutable or beyond the class members’ control; and (4) whether the class is a minority\n\nor politically powerless.

The third and fourth factors (immutability and lack of political power), however,\n\n“are not strictly necessary factors to identify a suspect class.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 181.\n\nIndeed, as to immutability, the California Supreme Court has pointed out that, under\n\nCalifornia law, “a person’s religion is a suspect classification for equal protection\n\npurposes, and one’s religion, of course, is not immutable but is a matter over which an\n\nindividual has control.” Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (citations omitted). Likewise,\n\nas to lack of political power, the California Supreme Court has pointed out that “if a\n\ngroup’s current political powerlessness were a prerequisite to a characteristic’s being\n\nconsidered a constitutionally suspect basis for differential treatment, it would be\n\nimpossible to justify the numerous decisions that continue to treat sex, race, and religion\n\nas suspect classifications.” Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 443 (emphasis in original); see\n\nalso Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 426 (characterizing history of discrimination and ability to\n\nperform or contribute to society as “required” factors, and immutability and political\n\npowerlessness as “other considerations that, in a given case, may be relevant” (citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n¶146 In the present case, the parties’ disagreement centers primarily on the first and\n\nfourth factors—history of discrimination and lack of political power.

History of Discrimination\n\n¶147 As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently observed, “[i]t is easy to\n\nconclude that homosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination.” Windsor, 699 F.3d\n\nat 182. Indeed, as I discussed in my Snetsinger concurrence, “[i]t is overwhelmingly\n\nclear that gays and lesbians have been historically subject to unequal treatment and\n\ninvidious discrimination.” Snetsinger, ¶¶ 45-53 (Nelson, J., specially concurring); accord\n\nVarnum 763 N.W.2d at 889-90; Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 432-34. “Outside of racial and\n\nreligious minorities, we can think of no group which has suffered such pernicious and\n\nsustained hostility, and such immediate and severe opprobrium, as homosexuals.”\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (bracketed material and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   “Perhaps the most telling proof of animus and discrimination against\n\nhomosexuals in this country is that, for many years and in many states, homosexual\n\nconduct was criminal.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 182. In point of fact, although this Court\n\nheld 15 years ago that homosexuals have the right under Montana’s Constitution to\n\nengage in private, consensual, noncommercial sexual conduct with other adults free of\n\ngovernmental interference or regulation, Gryczan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"884297\"><a href=\"/opinion/884297/gryczan-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the\n\nLegislature has repeatedly refused in multiple subsequent legislative sessions to repeal\n\nthe statutory criminalization of “sexual contact or sexual intercourse between two persons\n\nof the same sex,” §§ 45-2-101(21), 45-5-505, MCA; Aff. of Christine Kaufmann at 4 &\n\nAttachment A (detailing the failed efforts to repeal this statutory language).\n\n¶148 Plaintiffs filed the affidavit of Dr. George Chauncey, a professor of history at Yale\n\nUniversity. Dr. Chauncey states that, in his professional opinion, “gay and lesbian people\n\n                                             86\n\fhave been subject to widespread and significant discrimination and hostility in the United\n\nStates, including the State of Montana.” He notes that among the most conspicuous\n\nlegacies of this discrimination are “the numerous state statutes and constitutional\n\namendments that brand gays and lesbians as second-class citizens by denying them the\n\nright to marry the person they love” and “the federal Defense of Marriage Act that\n\nprohibits the federal government from recognizing such marriages legally entered into in\n\nstates where they are allowed.” Dr. Chauncey provides a detailed historical record of\n\nanti-gay discrimination and the roots of such discrimination. Aff. of George Chauncey,\n\nPh.D., at 3-22. His discussion is extensive, spanning 20 single-spaced pages, and it is not\n\npossible to recite every example of anti-gay discrimination and violence he describes. I\n\nshall attempt, however, to highlight the main points of his discussion.\n\n¶149 Dr. Chauncey explains that through much of the twentieth century, in particular,\n\ngay men and lesbians have suffered under the weight of medical theories that treated their\n\ndesires as a disorder, penal laws that condemned their consensual adult sexual behavior\n\nas a crime, and federal and state civil statutes, regulations, and policies that discriminated\n\nagainst them on the basis of their sexual orientation. Beginning in the 1930s and 1940s,\n\nmany states prohibited gay people from being served in restaurants and bars. In the\n\n1950s, the federal government banned the employment of homosexuals and insisted that\n\nits private contractors ferret out and dismiss their gay employees. Across the century,\n\nmany municipalities periodically launched police campaigns to suppress gay meeting\n\nplaces and sought to purge gay civil servants from government employment. Many\n\nclergy condemned homosexuality as sinful. Leading physicians and medical researchers\n\n                                             87\n\fclaimed that homosexuality was a pathological condition or disease. Government leaders\n\nand the media justified anti-gay discrimination and the suppression of gay meeting places\n\nby fostering stereotypes of homosexuals as child molesters. These stereotypes have had\n\nenduring consequences and continue to inspire public fears and hostility, especially\n\nconcerning gay teachers and parents.      In the 1990s, following Anita Bryant’s lead,\n\nactivists opposed to gay rights frequently fomented voter fear of gay people by reviving\n\ndemonic stereotypes of homosexuals as perverts who threatened the nation’s children and\n\nmoral character. Such tactics have been invoked in Montana. In 1995, the Montana\n\nSenate included homosexual acts in a bill requiring the registration of sexual and violent\n\noffenders. Senator Al Bishop, a supporter of the bill, stated on the Senate floor that\n\nhomosexual sex is “even worse than a violent sexual act.” During a 2003 debate over\n\nkeeping Montana’s criminal sodomy law on the books—despite this Court’s decision in\n\nGryczan—a member of the Coalition for Community Responsibility asserted that “[g]ay\n\nmen think they are doing children a favor by sodomizing them.” During the 2005\n\nlegislative session, Senator Dan McGee of Laurel stated, “I’ll never be able to support\n\nbills which try to overturn centuries of moral ideology. Homosexuality is wrong.” In\n\n2010, opponents of the Missoula ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual\n\norientation and gender identity stated that passage of the ordinance would result in\n\n“unacceptable loss of safety and privacy for women and children.” Numerous bills have\n\nbeen proposed to add sexual orientation to Montana’s antidiscrimination laws and to\n\nMontana’s hate-crimes law, but all have failed. (Christine Kauffman details the repeated\n\ndefeat of such legislation in Attachment A to her affidavit, at pages 3 to 7.) Earlier this\n\n                                            88\n\fyear, the Hamilton School Board voted to remove sexual orientation from a proposed\n\nanti-bullying policy and not to include sexual orientation in the district’s equal-education\n\nand equal-employment policies. See David Erickson, Sexual Orientation Not Included in\n\nHamilton Schools’ Anti-Bullying Policy, Ravalli Republic (Mar. 30, 2012).\n\n¶150 Dr. Chauncey notes that gay people continue to face discrimination from highly\n\nregarded institutions. For example, the Boy Scouts of America, a federally chartered\n\norganization, insists that “homosexual conduct is not morally straight” and refuses to\n\nallow gay men into the organization. Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In 1984, three teens attacked 23-year-old Charlie Howard due to his sexual\n\norientation and threw him off a bridge into the Kenduskeag Stream in Maine, where he\n\ndrowned. In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a college student in Wyoming, was bound, tied to a\n\nfence, beaten with a pistol, and left to die because he was gay. In 2008, Lawrence Fobes\n\nKing, a 15-year-old student in California, died two days after he was shot in school by a\n\nfellow student because of his sexual orientation. The FBI reported 1,260 hate crimes\n\nbased on perceived sexual orientation in 1998 and 1,297 in 2008.\n\n¶151 In its Order, the District Court observed that “there appears little doubt that\n\nPlaintiffs have been subject to private prejudice, discrimination, and even violence in\n\nMontana.” Indeed, Plaintiffs describe various ways in which they have been harassed\n\nbecause of their sexual orientation. One plaintiff, for example, was labeled a “lesbian\n\nbaby-killer” on a neo-Nazi website, and “wanted dead or alive” posters of her were hung\n\nin downtown Bozeman, causing her to fear for her physical safety. Another plaintiff,\n\n                                            89\n\fwho grew up in Great Falls and worked at the Cascade County Regional Youth Services\n\nCenter for several years, describes an incident when a Cascade County Commissioner\n\nconfronted her and told her that gay people are dangerous and should not be allowed to\n\nwork with youth. Plaintiffs describe demeaning instances where employers, healthcare\n\nworkers, and others refused to recognize or honor their same-sex relationships.\n\n¶152 The State concedes that “gays and lesbians have been subject to private prejudice,\n\ndiscrimination, and violence in Montana” (emphasis added). But the State contends that\n\nPlaintiffs “have yet to identify a single instance of any targeted State action against them\n\nthat they ask the Court to review and invalidate.” This contention is simply bizarre. The\n\nquestion at hand is whether gays and lesbians have suffered a history of discrimination.\n\nClearly they have. The State’s suggestion that all of the prejudice and discrimination has\n\nbeen purely “private” is utterly ridiculous. Indeed, the State’s position flies in the face of\n\nthe substantial evidence presented in the District Court, none of which the State refuted.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious evidence of “public” discrimination against gays and lesbians\n\nis the codification of disparate treatment in at least three Montana statutes (§§ 40-1-103,\n\n40-1-401(1)(d), and 45-2-101(21), MCA), not to mention the Montana Constitution itself\n\n(Mont. Const. art. XIII, § 7). The State implies that there was not “any expressed animus\n\nunderlying the approval of CI-96.” (CI-96 refers to Constitutional Amendment 96, the\n\n2004 ballot measure which added the Marriage Amendment to Montana’s Constitution.)\n\nBut as discussed in the Marriage Amendment section below, that provision demonstrably\n\nwas motivated by animus toward gays and lesbians. The State fails to provide any\n\n\n\n                                             90\n\fevidence or sensible argument to refute Plaintiffs’ overwhelming showing that\n\nhomosexuals as a group have historically endured persecution and discrimination.\n\n                                    2. Relation to Ability\n\n¶153 “There are some distinguishing characteristics, such as age or mental handicap,\n\nthat may arguably inhibit an individual’s ability to contribute to society, at least in some\n\nrespect. But homosexuality is not one of them. The aversion homosexuals experience\n\nhas nothing to do with aptitude or performance.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 182-83; accord\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (“sexual orientation is a characteristic . . . that bears no\n\nrelation to a person’s ability to perform or contribute to society”); Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n435 (“homosexuality bears no relation at all to an individual’s ability to contribute fully\n\nto society”; “an individual’s homosexual orientation implies no impairment in judgment,\n\nstability, reliability or general social or vocational capabilities” (brackets and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Varnum 763 N.W.2d at 891 (“sexual orientation is broadly\n\nrecognized in Iowa to be irrelevant to a person’s ability to contribute to society”). The\n\nState does not contend otherwise.\n\n¶154 A classification which bears no relationship to a person’s ability to contribute to\n\nsociety “is likely based on irrelevant stereotypes and prejudice.” Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at\n\n890. A classification unrelated to a person’s ability to perform or contribute to society\n\ntypically reflects prejudice and antipathy—a view that those in the burdened class are not\n\nas worthy or deserving as others—or reflects outmoded notions of the relative capabilities\n\nof persons with the characteristic. Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 890; Cleburne, 473 U.S. at\n\n440-41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254-55. Such is the case here.\n\n                                             91\n\f                                      3. Immutability\n\n¶155 Although often couched in terms of “immutability,” the Second Circuit explained\n\nin Windsor that the question under this factor is whether there are obvious, immutable, or\n\ndistinguishing characteristics that define a discrete group. 699 F.3d at 183. For instance,\n\nclassifications based on alienage, illegitimacy, and national origin are all subject to\n\nheightened scrutiny, even though these characteristics do not declare themselves, and\n\noften may be disclosed or suppressed as a matter of preference, and even though alienage\n\nand illegitimacy are actually subject to change. “What seems to matter is whether the\n\ncharacteristic of the class [invites] discrimination when it is manifest.” Windsor, 699\n\nF.3d at 183. Here, the characteristic that distinguishes gays and lesbians from others and\n\nqualifies them for recognition as a distinct and discrete group is the characteristic that\n\nhistorically has resulted in their social and legal ostracism: their attraction to persons of\n\nthe same sex. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 436; accord Windsor, 699 F.3d at 184 (“sexual\n\norientation is a sufficiently distinguishing characteristic to identify the discrete minority\n\nclass of homosexuals”); Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 964 (“[s]exual orientation is\n\nfundamental to a person’s identity and is a distinguishing characteristic that defines gays\n\nand lesbians as a discrete group”).\n\n¶156 To the extent that “immutability” has any significance to the analysis, this prong\n\nof the inquiry is satisfied when the identifying trait is so central to a person’s identity that\n\nit would be abhorrent for government to penalize a person for refusing to change it.\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 438; Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 893; Watkins v.

In this\n\n                                              92\n\fregard, the federal district court in Perry found, based on the evidence presented, that\n\n“[i]ndividuals do not generally choose their sexual orientation. No credible evidence\n\nsupports a finding that an individual may, through conscious decision, therapeutic\n\nintervention or any other method, change his or her sexual orientation.” 704 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 966.   The court noted that sexual orientation is “an enduring pattern of sexual,\n\naffectional or romantic desires for and attractions to men, women or both sexes” and that\n\n“[t]he vast majority of people are consistent in self-identification, behavior and attraction\n\nthroughout their adult lives. Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 964. Accordingly, I agree with the\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court that “[b]ecause a person’s sexual orientation is so integral an\n\naspect of one’s identity, it is not appropriate to require a person to repudiate or change his\n\nor her sexual orientation in order to avoid discriminatory treatment.” Marriage Cases,\n\n183 P.3d at 442; accord Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 893 (“Accordingly, because sexual\n\norientation is central to personal identity and may be altered if at all only at the expense\n\nof significant damage to the individual’s sense of self, classifications based on sexual\n\norientation are no less entitled to consideration as a suspect or quasi-suspect class than\n\nany other group that has been deemed to exhibit an immutable characteristic.” (brackets\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                    4. Political Power\n\n¶157 The last factor is premised on the notion that “[w]ithout political power, minorities\n\nmay be unable to protect themselves from discrimination at the hands of the majoritarian\n\npolitical process.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 184. As noted, the Judiciary has a “special role\n\nin safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to such a position of\n\n                                             93\n\fpolitical powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian\n\npolitical process.” Washington v.

The question is whether they\n       have the strength to politically protect themselves from wrongful\n       discrimination.    When the Supreme Court ruled that sex-based\n       classifications were subject to heightened scrutiny in 1973, the Court\n       acknowledged that women had already achieved major political victories.\n       See Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108781\"><a href=\"/opinion/108781/frontiero-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court noted that\n\nthe seemingly small number of acknowledged homosexuals in positions of power and\n\nauthority “is attributable either to a hostility that excludes them or to a hostility that keeps\n\ntheir sexual preference private—which, for our purposes, amounts to much the same\n\nthing.”   Windsor, 699 F.3d at 184-85.          The court further noted that these same\n\nconsiderations can also be expected “to suppress some degree of political activity by\n\ninhibiting the kind of open association that advances political agendas.” Windsor, 699\n\nF.3d at 185; see also Rowland v.

Thus, the court\n\nconcluded that “homosexuals are not in a position to adequately protect themselves from\n\nthe discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public.” Windsor, 699 F.3d at 185.\n\n¶160 The Connecticut Supreme Court likewise had “little difficulty in concluding that\n\ngay persons are entitled to heightened constitutional protection despite some recent\n\npolitical progress.” Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 444. The court cited several considerations in\n\nthis regard. First, the discrimination that gay persons have suffered has been so pervasive\n\nand severe—even though their sexual orientation has no bearing at all on their ability to\n\ncontribute to or perform in society—that it is highly unlikely that legislative enactments\n\nalone will suffice to eliminate that discrimination. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 444. Second,\n\n                                              95\n\finsofar as gay persons play a role in the political process, it is apparent that their numbers\n\nreflect their status as a small and insular minority. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 446. Third,\n\nalthough the state legislature eventually enacted a gay-rights law, its enactment was\n\npreceded by nearly a decade of numerous failed attempts at passage, and the legislation\n\ncontained “an unprecedented proviso” expressing the legislature’s position that it does\n\nnot condone homosexuality. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 448-50. Fourth, while the enactment\n\nof remedial legislation aimed at protecting a class from discrimination may indicate that\n\nthe subject group possesses some political power, it also supports the conclusion that the\n\nsubject group is in need of heightened constitutional protection. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n450-51; accord Hernandez v. Robles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28-29 (N.Y. 2006) (Kaye, C.J., &\n\nCiparick, J., dissenting) (the passage of civil rights measures “acknowledge[s]—rather\n\nthan mark[s] the end of—a history of purposeful discrimination”). Fifth, the awareness\n\nof public hatred and the fear of violence that often accompanies it undermine efforts to\n\ndevelop an effective gay political identity; gay persons are disinclined to risk retaliation\n\nby open identification with the movement, and potential allies from outside the gay and\n\nlesbian community may think twice about allying their fortunes with such a despised\n\npopulation. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 452. Sixth, gay persons lack the political power that\n\nAfrican-Americans and women possess today; yet, political gains by African-Americans\n\nand women have not been found to obviate the need for heightened judicial scrutiny of\n\nlegislation that draws distinctions on the basis of race or gender. Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n453. Given all of these factors (and the detailed analysis accompanying them), the court\n\nheld that “gay persons cannot be deprived of heightened judicial protection merely\n\n                                             96\n\fbecause of their relatively limited political influence.” Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 453-54; see\n\nalso Varnum, 763 N.W.2d at 895 (“gay and lesbian people are not so politically powerful\n\nas to overcome the unfair and severe prejudice that history suggests produces\n\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation”).\n\n¶161 In the present case, Dr. Chauncey provided his professional opinion that “gay and\n\nlesbian people do not currently possess a meaningful degree of political power in the\n\nUnited States or in the State of Montana.” He cites various examples reflecting the\n\npersistence of anti-gay discrimination over the last decade. The State has not refuted Dr.\n\nChauncey’s opinion or any of the evidence underlying it. I also note that the entire\n\nunderpinning of the Marriage Amendment, discussed in further detail below, was based\n\non attacking and demeaning homosexuals and homosexuality. Accordingly, in light of\n\nDr. Chauncey’s unrefuted report, the detailed discussions in the Windsor and Kerrigan\n\nopinions, and the circumstances underlying the passage of the Marriage Amendment, I\n\nconclude that gays and lesbians are not in a position to adequately protect themselves\n\nfrom the discriminatory wishes of the majoritarian public.\n\n                                      5. Summary\n\n¶162 Based on the foregoing analysis under each of the factors, I conclude and would\n\nhold that sexual orientation is a suspect class under Article II, Section 4 of the Montana\n\nConstitution. Correspondingly, I would also hold that discrimination based on sexual\n\norientation in the provision of statutory benefits and protections is subject to “strict\n\nscrutiny” review. See Snetsinger, ¶ 17 (“Strict scrutiny applies if a suspect class or\n\nfundamental right is affected.”). Under the strict-scrutiny standard, the State has the\n\n                                            97\n\fburden of showing that the law or policy is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest. 8 Snetsinger, ¶ 17. I would reverse the District Court’s judgment\n\nand direct it to enter a declaratory order encompassing these holdings. But for reasons\n\ndiscussed in the Declaratory Judgment section above, I would not order injunctive relief\n\nat this time and instead would permit the legislative and executive branches to implement\n\nour constitutional interpretation in the first instance.\n\n                                     F. Human Dignity\n\n¶163 As just discussed, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory ruling that gay, lesbian,\n\nand bisexual persons are a suspect class in Montana and the State’s disparate treatment of\n\nsame-sex couples is subject to “strict scrutiny” review under the Equal Protection Clause\n\nof Article II, Section 4. This approach is sufficient to resolve this case in their favor.\n\n¶164 That said, however, it is equally important to acknowledge the more fundamental\n\nhuman issue in this case. In addition to guaranteeing “the equal protection of the laws,”\n\nArticle II, Section 4 also provides that “[t]he dignity of the human being is inviolable.” I\n\naddressed this provision of Montana’s Constitution at length in Baxter v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888660\"><a href=\"/opinion/888660/baxter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 74-94, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888660\"><a href=\"/opinion/888660/baxter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888660\"><a href=\"/opinion/888660/baxter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Nelson, J., specially concurring). In the\n\ninterests of brevity, given that this is already a lengthy dissent, I am not going to repeat\n\nmy entire analysis and discussion of the Dignity Clause here.\n\n\n\n       8\n         The State has put forth one purported objective for the exclusion of same-sex\ncouples from the statutory benefits and obligations provided to married couples: “that an\noption short of marriage would detract from or dilute the uniqueness of the marital bond.”\nFor reasons discussed in the Marriage Amendment section below, I conclude that this\nasserted justification is without merit. See ¶¶ 174-178, 186-187, 204-205, infra.\n                                               98\n\f¶165 Suffice it to say that, as I stated in Baxter, human dignity is perhaps the most\n\nfundamental right in the Declaration of Rights. Indeed, it is the only right in Montana’s\n\nConstitution that is “inviolable”—meaning that it is absolute. No individual may be\n\nstripped of his or her human dignity by the government or by a private organization.\n\nBaxter, ¶ 83 (Nelson, J., specially concurring).\n\n¶166 Human dignity may be defined in many ways. But, at bottom, it encompasses a\n\nfundament truth: every individual person is intrinsically valuable and has inherent worth\n\nbecause we are sentient beings with the capacity of independent, autonomous, rational,\n\nand responsible thought and action. Baxter, ¶ 84 (Nelson, J., specially concurring).\n\nDemonizing, demeaning, degrading, and stereotyping people because of their sexual\n\norientation is simply an attempt to strip those so condemned of their worth, their value,\n\nand hence their dignity.

THE MARRIAGE AMENDMENT\n\n¶169          Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely\n              between man and his God, that he owes account to none other\n              for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of\n              government reach actions only, and not opinions, I\n              contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole\n              American people which declared that their legislature should\n              ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\n              prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of\n              separation between church and State. 9\n\n                              A.

They include the rights to privacy, due\n\nprocess, human dignity, religion, and equal protection of the laws, to name but a few.\n\nArticle III enumerates general governmental provisions, such as separation of powers, the\n\noath of office, and the powers of initiative and referendum. Article IV concerns suffrage\n\nand elections. Articles V, VI, and VII set forth the powers of the Legislature, the\n\nExecutive, and the Judiciary, respectively. Article VIII concerns revenue and finance;\n\nArticle IX the environment and natural resources; Article X education and public lands;\n\nArticle XI local government; Article XII departments and institutions; and Article XIV\n\nconstitutional revision and amendment.\n\n¶171 That leaves Article XIII, which is titled “General Provisions.” Section 1 concerns\n\nthe chartering of nonmunicipal corporations. Section 2 directs the Legislature to provide\n\nfor an office of consumer counsel. Section 3 (repealed in 1986) required the Legislature\n\nto create a salary commission. Section 4 directs the Legislature to adopt a code of ethics.\n\nSection 5 requires the Legislature to enact liberal homestead and exemption laws. And\n\nSection 6 prohibits perpetuities except for charitable purposes.\n\n¶172 Last among these general provisions is Section 7, the Marriage Amendment,\n\nwhich was added in 2004. It states, in its entirety: “Only a marriage between one man\n\nand one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.” Mont. Const.\n\nart. XIII, § 7. I note that this is the only provision in the Montana Constitution that\n\n                                            101\n\fpurports to affirmatively strip an entire class of citizens of an elemental civil right\n\naccorded, presumptively and without thought or hesitation, to all other Montanans.\n\n                     B. Irrelevance of the Marriage Amendment\n\n¶173 The State and several of its amici drape themselves in the mantel of the Marriage\n\nAmendment as an underpinning for their arguments. They argue that granting committed\n\nintimate same-sex couples any of the statutory benefits and protections which are\n\naccorded to different-sex married couples—while still denying same-sex couples the right\n\nto marry—may violate the Marriage Amendment. I say “may” because, as noted earlier,\n\nthe Attorney General’s position is difficult to reconcile. On one hand, he seems to\n\ncontend that the Marriage Amendment precludes Plaintiffs’ claims, yet, on the other\n\nhand, he concedes that the Legislature could provide same-sex couples with similar\n\nprotections as are granted to different-sex married couples, by means of a civil-union or\n\ndomestic-partnership scheme, if it chose to do so. See ¶ 63, supra. Regardless of the\n\nState’s actual position on this matter, however, there is no question where the State’s\n\namici stand: They believe that the Marriage Amendment precludes Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\nSee Amicus Curiae Br. of Mont. Catholic Conf. and Other Christian Churches at 5 (“This\n\nlawsuit is, in effect, an attempt to change the Constitutional and statutory definition of\n\nmarriage.”); Br. of Amicus Curiae Mont. Family Found. at 3 (“Th[e] constitutional\n\ndefinition of marriage is, in reality, what Appellants challenge . . . .”); Br. of Amici\n\nCuriae Sen. President, Sen. Majority Leader, Speaker of the H.R., and H. Majority\n\nLeader of the State of Montana at 7-13 (analogizing the issue here, concerning same-sex\n\ncouples, to the “moral dilemma” in the mid-1800s of whether slavery was “right” or\n\n                                           102\n\f“wrong,” and arguing that this Court should not “exalt the desires of the minority” over\n\nthe will of the majority expressed through Montana’s Marriage Amendment). Needless\n\nto say, I disagree entirely with this view of the Marriage Amendment’s scope.\n\n¶174 First of all, Plaintiffs do not seek the status of “marriage.” They seek only the\n\nopportunity to obtain the protections which the State of Montana has made available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples—such as decision-making authority during medical emergencies\n\nand end-of-life situations, a financial safety net under the tax code, and legal rights in the\n\nevent of a spouse’s injury, death, or intestacy. In the most basic terms, these committed\n\nintimate same-sex couples—some of whom have been together for decades—merely ask\n\nthat they not be treated as “legal strangers” to each other. It is difficult to comprehend\n\nhow granting them this basic civil right infringes upon or undermines the institution of\n\nmarriage, or threatens the rights of different-sex couples.\n\n¶175 Indeed, the same sort of paranoid arguments were once held out as obvious and\n\nincontrovertible reasons to deny the constitutional rights of different-race couples.

As we now recognize,\n\nthese supposedly self-evident propositions are, in fact, utterly groundless. Upholding the\n\nrights of different-race couples did not impinge on the institution of marriage or deprive it\n\nof its vitality, and neither will upholding the rights of the same-sex couples here, who do\n\nnot even ask to be “married” in the first place.\n\n¶176 Secondly, “[t]hat the Marriage Amendment effectively prevents same-sex couples\n\nfrom marrying does not automatically permit the government to treat them differently in\n\nother ways.” Alaska Civ.

For example, the right of a spouse to\n\nbe appointed as guardian of an incapacitated person is not exclusive to the spouse. The\n\nright is also shared by “a relative or friend who has demonstrated a sincere, longstanding\n\ninterest in the welfare of the incapacitated person.” Section 72-5-312, MCA. Likewise,\n\nthe partner-or-family-member-assault statute protects not only spouses, but also “persons\n\nwho have been or are currently in a dating or ongoing intimate relationship with a person\n\nof the opposite sex.” Section 45-5-206, MCA. Other examples exist, but the point is that\n\nthese illustrations demonstrate, unequivocally, that there is no merit to the premise that\n\nthe Marriage Amendment bars the State from granting unmarried persons the same rights\n\nand protections that the State grants to married persons. Neither the State nor any of its\n\namici cite any authority for such a proposition.\n\n¶177 In fact, the State’s reasoning on this point is entirely circular. The State offers the\n\nfollowing syllogism: Premise 1 – “Marriage is defined by [§ 40-1-103, MCA] as ‘a\n\npersonal relationship between a man and a woman arising out of a civil contract to which\n\nthe consent of the parties is essential’ ”; Premise 2 – This definition “has been\n\nincorporated into the Montana Constitution by [the Marriage Amendment]”;\n\nConclusion – “Spousal benefits, therefore, flow from the now-constitutional status of\n\nmarriage.” All that Premise 1 and Premise 2 establish, however, is that the “personal\n\nrelationship” recognized by the State must, under the Montana Constitution, consist of\n\none man and one woman. The third (unstated) premise of the State’s syllogism is that\n\nthis “personal relationship” includes the right to “spousal benefits.” Yet, neither the\n\n                                            105\n\fMarriage Amendment nor § 40-1-103, MCA, says anything about spousal benefits, and\n\nthe State concedes elsewhere in its brief that there is “no constitutional or judicially\n\nenforceable mandate for the Legislature to provide or fund spousal benefits.” See In re\n\nMarriage Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426 (Cal. 2008) (“the constitutional right to marry clearly\n\ndoes not obligate the state to afford specific tax or other governmental benefits on the\n\nbasis of a couple’s family relationship”). So, if the Legislature is not mandated to\n\nprovide or fund spousal benefits, then obviously such benefits are not implicit in the\n\n“personal relationship” identified in § 40-1-103, MCA. Indeed, to hold otherwise could\n\ngive rise to innumerable Takings and Due Process claims every time the Legislature\n\nreduced or eliminated a spousal benefit. As Plaintiffs point out, and as the State tacitly\n\nadmits, the Legislature’s conferral of such benefits is entirely “discretionary.”\n\nApparently the point the State is attempting to make is that when the State does choose to\n\ngrant a benefit to married persons, the benefit cannot be granted to anyone else (i.e., to\n\nunmarried persons). But that is clearly not true, given the various statutes, noted above,\n\nwhich grant the same benefits to non-spouses as they do spouses.\n\n¶178 Notably, the California Supreme Court concluded that Proposition 8, which\n\namended California’s Constitution to restrict marriage to one man and one woman, did\n\nnot also “have the effect of abrogating the constitutional right of same-sex couples to\n\nenter into an officially recognized family relationship with a designation other than\n\nmarriage.” Strauss v. Horton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (Cal. 2009). The court noted that\n\n      an alternative, much more sweeping initiative measure—proposing the\n      addition of a new constitutional section that would have provided not only\n      that “[o]nly marriage between one man and one woman is valid or\n\n                                           106\n\f       recognized in California,” but also that “[n]either the Legislature nor any\n       court, government institution, government agency, initiative statute, local\n       government, or government official shall . . . bestow statutory rights,\n       incidents, or employee benefits of marriage on unmarried individuals”—\n       was circulated for signature at the same time as Proposition 8, but did not\n       obtain sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.\n\nStrauss, 207 P.3d at 76 n. 8 (brackets and ellipsis in original). In Nebraska, voters did\n\npass a more sweeping measure of this sort in November 2000. As a result, Nebraska’s\n\nConstitution now states: “Only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid or\n\nrecognized in Nebraska. The uniting of two persons of the same sex in a civil union,\n\ndomestic partnership, or other similar same-sex relationship shall not be valid or\n\nrecognized in Nebraska.” Neb. Const. art. I, § 29 (emphasis added). If the additional\n\nlanguage contained in Nebraska’s Marriage Amendment and in the failed alternative to\n\nCalifornia’s Proposition 8 were part of Montana’s Marriage Amendment, the State’s and\n\nits amici’s arguments here might have traction. But that is not the case, and it is not the\n\nprerogative of the State, its amici, or this Court to insert such language. Section 1-2-101,\n\nMCA; Jud. Stands. Commn. v.

By its plain terms, Montana’s Marriage Amendment applies to “marriage.” It says\n\nnothing about civil unions, domestic partnerships, or other similar same-sex relationships.\n\nIt does not say that the government cannot bestow statutory rights, incidents, or employee\n\nbenefits of marriage on unmarried individuals. As the State concedes, the Legislature\n\ncould enact a civil-union or domestic-partnership scheme if it chose to do so.\n\n¶179   Accordingly, there was no need for the Attorney General to inject the Marriage\n\nAmendment into this case, nor was there any legal basis for the religious and “family\n\n\n                                            107\n\fvalues” organizations to file numerous amicus briefs supporting the Attorney General’s\n\narguments in that respect. Nevertheless, the Marriage Amendment has been put at issue,\n\nand it is thus necessary to address this aspect of the State’s approach. For the reasons\n\nwhich follow, and based on my examination of the provision for what it actually is and\n\ndoes, I conclude the Marriage Amendment itself cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n                         C. Basis of the Marriage Amendment\n\n¶180 The entire underpinning of the Marriage Amendment is based on attacking and\n\ndemeaning homosexuals and homosexuality. This is abundantly clear from the 2004\n\nVoter Information Pamphlet provided to voters by the Montana Secretary of State and\n\ncontained in the record of this case. In their argument for the Marriage Amendment\n\n(referred to as Constitutional Initiative 96 or CI-96), Proponents rail against “homosexual\n\nactivists” who, Proponents claim, are seeking out “activist judges” to force Montanans to\n\nbecome part of “a vast, untested social experiment.” Proponents assert that “homosexual\n\nactivists” are “threatening” not only “the time-honored, vital institution of marriage,” but\n\nalso “the freedom to teach our children as we wish.” Proponents warn parents that if\n\nCI-96 fails, “[e]very public school in Montana would be required to teach your children\n\nthat same-sex marriage and homosexuality are perfectly normal” (emphasis in original).\n\nProponents use similar scare tactics in an attempt to rally “small business employers,”\n\nasserting that they “may someday be required to provide expanded health coverage,\n\nretirement and fringe benefits to same-sex ‘spouses’ of employees” (emphasis in\n\noriginal), which allegedly “could hurt Montana’s economy and jobs.” Proponents also\n\nwarn churchgoers that if CI-96 does not pass, “[y]our church will be legally pressured to\n\n                                            108\n\fperform same-sex weddings” and may lose its “tax exemptions” if it refuses to perform\n\nsuch ceremonies. Finally, Proponents argue that CI-96 is necessary for childrearing:\n\n       Natural marriage is extremely important for future generations. Men and\n       women are distinctly different. Each gender brings vitally important, and\n       unique, elements to a child’s development. Saying that children don’t\n       necessarily need fathers or mothers is saying that one gender or the other\n       is unnecessary.      A loving and compassionate society always aids\n       motherless and fatherless families.       Compassionate societies never\n       intentionally create families without mothers or fathers, which is exactly\n       what same-sex homes do. [Emphasis in original.]\n\n¶181 Notably, in their rebuttal to the opponents’ argument against CI-96, Proponents\n\nstate that the initiative “doesn’t limit the ability of homosexuals to enter into contractual\n\nagreements to protect their assets,” “doesn’t stop employers from giving same-sex\n\ncouples the same benefits as their married employees (if they so choose),” and “doesn’t\n\nstop churches from recognizing same-sex relationships.” Proponents categorically deny\n\nthat the Marriage Amendment “limits the rights of homosexuals.” They state that the\n\nMarriage Amendment accomplishes one thing:           “It simply stops the legalization of\n\nhomosexual marriage,” which Proponents claim has never been a “right” of same-sex\n\ncouples in the first place. Proponents make it clear that their goal is to preserve “the\n\nhistorical definition of marriage.” Proponents present no argument that the Marriage\n\nAmendment will go further and prohibit state government from granting same-sex\n\ncouples legal protections similar to those possessed by married persons. Proponents did\n\nnot incorporate into Montana’s Marriage Amendment the language used in Article I,\n\nSection 29 of the Nebraska Constitution, which had been approved by Nebraska electors\n\nseveral years earlier (in November 2000).\n\n\n                                            109\n\f¶182 In any event, the important point here is that there is no factual or legal basis\n\nwhatsoever for any of Proponents’ assertions in support of CI-96. Indeed, the Voter\n\nInformation Pamphlet offers no actual reasoning, statistics, or evidence to support the\n\nfears it mongers. Yet, the fabricated threats posed by homosexuals to marriage, family,\n\nchildren, business, religion, and the economy were the so-called “official” justifications\n\nfor the Marriage Amendment. It is clear that the promoters of the Marriage Amendment\n\nwere playing to a populist paranoia grounded in something other than actual evidence.\n\n¶183 In this regard, some useful insights may be gleaned from the strikingly similar\n\ncampaign four years later (in 2008) in support of Proposition 8 in California. Essentially\n\nidentical to Montana’s Marriage Amendment, Proposition 8 (now Article I, Section 7.5 of\n\nthe California Constitution) states in its entirety: “Only marriage between a man and a\n\nwoman is valid or recognized in California.” Following its approval by a slim majority\n\nof California voters (52.3 percent), Proposition 8 was challenged in federal court. In\n\nJanuary 2010, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California held\n\na 12-day bench trial, during which it heard testimony from 8 lay witnesses and 11 expert\n\nwitnesses.     The federal district court then entered extensive findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, ultimately deciding that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional under both\n\nthe Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.

Because the proponents of Proposition 8 “vigorously” defended the\n\nconstitutionality of California’s Marriage Amendment, Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 931,\n\nand because a substantial evidentiary record was created concerning the alleged need for\n\n                                           110\n\fa prohibition against same-sex marriage, the Perry case provides valuable context and\n\ninsights for my discussion of Montana’s Marriage Amendment. I shall detail, therefore,\n\nthe pertinent parts of the Perry decision here.\n\n¶184 For starters, the federal district court found that the proponents of Proposition 8\n\nrelied “on fears that children exposed to the concept of same-sex marriage may become\n\ngay or lesbian” and “on stereotypes to show that same-sex relationships are inferior to\n\nopposite-sex relationships.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 988, 990. Indeed, the proponents\n\nadmitted as much:\n\n       “[P]assing Proposition 8 would depend on our ability to convince voters\n       that same-sex marriage had broader implications for Californians and was\n       not only about the two individuals involved in a committed gay\n       relationship.” “We strongly believed that a campaign in favor of traditional\n       marriage would not be enough to prevail.” “We probed long and hard in\n       countless focus groups and surveys to explore reactions to a variety of\n       consequences our issue experts identified” and they decided to create\n       campaign messaging focusing on “how this new ‘fundamental right’ would\n       be inculcated in young children through public schools.” “[T]here were\n       limits to the degree of tolerance Californians would afford the gay\n       community. They would entertain allowing gay marriage, but not if doing\n       so had significant implications for the rest of society.” “The Prop 8 victory\n       proves something that readers of Politics magazine know very well:\n       campaigns matter.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 988 (brackets in original) (quoting Frank Schubert & Jeff Flint,\n\nPassing Prop 8, Politics, Feb. 2009, at 45-47).\n\n¶185 Similar to the ballot argument for Montana’s Marriage Amendment, the ballot\n\nargument in support of Proposition 8 summarized the initiative as follows:\n\n       Proposition 8 is simple and straightforward. * * * Proposition 8 is about\n       preserving marriage; it’s not an attack on the gay lifestyle. * * * It protects\n       our children from being taught in public schools that “same-sex marriage”\n       is the same as traditional marriage. * * * While death, divorce, or other\n\n                                            111\n\f       circumstances may prevent the ideal, the best situation for a child is to be\n       raised by a married mother and father. * * * If the gay marriage ruling [of\n       the California Supreme Court] is not overturned, TEACHERS COULD BE\n       REQUIRED to teach young children there is no difference between gay\n       marriage and traditional marriage.\n\n       We should not accept a court decision that may result in public schools\n       teaching our own kids that gay marriage is ok. * * * [W]hile gays have the\n       right to their private lives, they do not have the right to redefine marriage\n       for everyone else.\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 930 (brackets and asterisks in original, internal quotation marks\n\nomitted) (quoting California Voter Information Guide, California General Election,\n\nTuesday, November 4, 2008). In a mailing leaflet, the Proposition 8 proponents accused\n\nthe California Supreme Court of being “activist” when it decreed earlier that year that\n\ngays and lesbians have the same fundamental right as heterosexuals to marry. See Perry,\n\n704 F. Supp. 2d at 988-89; Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 433-34 (“[W]e conclude that the\n\nright to marry . . . guarantees same-sex couples the same substantive constitutional rights\n\nas opposite-sex couples to choose one’s life partner and enter with that person into a\n\ncommitted, officially recognized, and protected family relationship that enjoys all of the\n\nconstitutionally based incidents of marriage.”). The Proposition 8 proponents argued that\n\n“ ‘[i]f traditional marriage goes by the wayside, then in every public school, children will\n\nbe indoctrinated with a message that is absolutely contrary to the values that their family\n\nis attempting to teach them at home.’ ” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 990. They suggested to\n\nvoters that “ ‘the fact that gay people are being asked to be recognized and have their\n\nrelationships recognized is an imposition on other people, as opposed to an extension of\n\nfundamental civil rights to gay and lesbian people.’ ” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 989.\n\n\n                                            112\n\fLike the proponents of Montana’s Marriage Amendment, the Proposition 8 proponents\n\n“focused on protecting children and the concern that people of faith and religious groups\n\nwould somehow be harmed by the recognition of gay marriage.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 990.   “The campaign conveyed a message that gay people and relationships are\n\ninferior, that homosexuality is undesirable and that children need to be protected from\n\nexposure to gay people and their relationships.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 990.\n\n¶186 Based on the evidence regarding the campaign to pass Proposition 8, the federal\n\ndistrict court concluded that “the most likely explanation for its passage [was] a desire to\n\nadvance the belief that opposite-sex couples are morally superior to same-sex couples.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1002-03. The court further observed, however, that none of the\n\nevidence supported the proponents’ premise that opposite-sex relationships are materially\n\ndistinct from same-sex relationships. To the contrary, “the evidence thoroughly rebutted\n\n[that premise]: rather than being different, same-sex and opposite-sex unions are, for all\n\npurposes relevant to California law, exactly the same.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1001.\n\nFurthermore, and contrary to the unsubstantiated fears asserted by the State’s amici in the\n\npresent case, the federal district court found that “[p]ermitting same-sex couples to marry\n\nwill not affect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have\n\nchildren outside of marriage or otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex marriages.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 972. In regard to these findings, the court pointed to extensive\n\nexpert testimony and other evidence in the record, plus various admissions by the\n\nProposition 8 proponents, highlights of which I shall note here:\n\n\n\n                                            113\n\f• “Gay and lesbian sexual orientations are ‘normal variation[s] and are considered\n  to be aspects of well-adjusted behavior.’ ”\n\n• “Homosexuality is not considered a mental disorder. The American Psychiatric\n  Association, the American Psychological Association and other major\n  professional mental health associations have all gone on record affirming that\n  homosexuality is a normal expression of sexuality and that it is not in any way a\n  form of pathology.”\n\n• “ ‘Courts and legal scholars have concluded that sexual orientation is not related\n  to an individual’s ability to contribute to society or perform in the workplace.’ ”\n\n• “Proponents admit that same-sex sexual orientation does not result in any\n  impairment in judgment or general social and vocational capabilities.”\n\n• “Proponents admit that gay and lesbian individuals, including plaintiffs, have\n  formed lasting, committed and caring relationships with persons of the same sex\n  and same-sex couples share their lives and participate in their communities\n  together.”\n\n• The American Psychoanalytic Association has stated that “ ‘gay men and\n  lesbians possess the same potential and desire for sustained loving and lasting\n  relationships as heterosexuals.’ ”\n\n• “Research that has compared the quality of same-sex and opposite-sex\n  relationships and the processes that affect those relationships consistently shows\n  ‘great similarity across couples, both same-sex and heterosexual.’ ”\n\n• “Same-sex couples have more similarities than differences with opposite-sex\n  couples, and any differences are marginal.”\n\n• “Married same-sex couples in Massachusetts have reported various benefits from\n  marriage including greater commitment to the relationship, more acceptance\n  from extended family, less worry over legal problems, greater access to health\n  benefits and benefits for their children.”\n\n• “Proponents admit that gay and lesbian individuals raise children together.”\n\n• “ ‘[S]ocial science has shown that the concerns often raised about children of\n  lesbian and gay parents—concerns that are generally grounded in prejudice\n  against and stereotypes about gay people—are unfounded.’ ”\n\n\n\n                                     114\n\f       • “Studies have demonstrated ‘very conclusively that children who are raised by\n         gay and lesbian parents are just as likely to be well-adjusted as children raised by\n         heterosexual parents.’ These results are ‘completely consistent with our broader\n         understanding of the factors that affect children’s adjustment.’ ”\n\n       • “Sociological and psychological peer-reviewed studies conclude that permitting\n         gay and lesbian individuals to marry does not cause any problems for children.”\n\n       • “Children do not need to be raised by a male parent and a female parent to be\n         well-adjusted, and having both a male and a female parent does not increase the\n         likelihood that a child will be well-adjusted.”\n\n       • “The genetic relationship between a parent and a child is not related to a child’s\n         adjustment outcomes.”\n\n       • “Allowing same-sex couples to marry will have ‘no impact’ on the stability of\n         marriage.”\n\n       • “When racial restrictions on marriage across color lines were abolished, there\n         was alarm and many people worried that the institution of marriage would be\n         degraded and devalued. But ‘there has been no evidence that the institution of\n         marriage has become less popular because * * * people can marry whoever they\n         want.’ ”\n\n       • “Data from Massachusetts on the ‘annual rates for marriage and for divorce’ for\n         ‘the four years prior to same-sex marriage being legal and the four years after’\n         show ‘that the rates of marriage and divorce are no different after [same-sex]\n         marriage was permitted than they were before.’ ”\n\n       • “The viability of civilization or social order does not depend upon marriage as an\n         exclusively heterosexual institution.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 961, 967-69, 972-73, 980-81.\n\n¶187 In sum, like the CI-96 campaign, the Proposition 8 campaign “relied heavily on\n\nnegative stereotypes about gays and lesbians.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1003. But\n\nwhen asked to demonstrate the validity of their arguments in court, the proponents failed\n\nto produce any actual evidence substantiating the notion that same-sex marriage harms\n\nchildren, is inferior to different-sex marriage, or threatens the stability of different-sex\n\n                                            115\n\fmarriage. More to the point, the challengers did produce substantial evidence—including\n\ndeposition testimony by two of the proponents’ own witnesses—refuting each of these\n\npropositions. In the end, it became apparent to the federal district court that “moral and\n\nreligious views form the only basis for a belief that same-sex couples are different from\n\nopposite-sex couples.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 1001 (emphases added).\n\n¶188 One such underlying moral and religious view is that men and women must adhere\n\nto specific gender roles in a marriage: the husband “is the bread winner” and the wife\n\n“stays at home.” Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 958-59, 975, 998. That is no longer the law\n\nin California or Montana, however. See Cal. Fam. Code § 720; § 40-2-101, MCA.\n\n       “[T]he primacy of the husband as the legal and economic representative of\n       the couple, and the protector and provider for his wife, was seen as\n       absolutely essential to what marriage was” in the nineteenth century.\n       Gender restrictions were slowly removed from marriage, but “because there\n       were such alarms about it and such resistance to change in this what had\n       been seen as quite an essential characteristic of marriage, it took a very very\n       long time before this trajectory of the removal of the state from prescribing\n       these rigid spousal roles was complete.” The removal of gender inequality\n       in marriage is now complete “to no apparent damage to the institution.\n       And, in fact, I think to the benefit of the institution.”\n\nPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 960 (brackets in original) (quoting trial testimony).\n\n¶189 Another underlying moral and religious view is that gay and lesbian relationships\n\nare sinful. Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 985-86. In this regard, one witness pointed out that\n\n       [t]he religious arguments that were mobilized in the 1950s to argue against\n       interracial marriage and integration as against God’s will are mirrored by\n       arguments that have been mobilized in the Proposition 8 campaign and\n       many of the campaigns since Anita Bryant’s ‘Save Our Children’\n       campaign, which argue that homosexuality itself or gay people or the\n       recognition of their equality is against God’s will.\n\n\n\n                                            116\n\fPerry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 985. 10 And this leads me to the crux of the matter: that\n\nMontana’s Marriage Amendment is an unconstitutional attempt to enforce a sectarian\n\nbelief (held by some 11) through Montana’s secular law.\n\n¶190 Indeed, the Marriage Amendment is undisputedly grounded in religious doctrine.\n\nThat much is apparent not only from the federal district court’s findings, but particularly\n\nfrom the fulminations of numerous religious organizations in the present case, led by the\n\nMontana Catholic Conference, against the prospect that gay, lesbian, and bisexual\n\nMontanans might enjoy some measure of legal protection for their relationships. If\n\nhomosexuality and same-sex relationships were not a religious issue, it is highly doubtful\n\nthat any of these amici would be so actively involved in this case. 12\n\n\n       10\n           See also e.g. Alan Sears & Craig Osten, The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the\nPrincipal Threat to Religious Freedom Today (Broadman & Holman 2003). It is\ndisturbing that the same sort of propaganda was used to demonize various disliked groups\nin pre-World War II Germany. Some examples of this are provided at the German\nPropaganda Archive, http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa, including The German\nNational Catechism, The Jewish World Plague, and Ten Responses to Jewish Lackeys.\nSee also Persecution of Homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust,\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany_and_the_H\nolocaust (which is a thorough and authoritatively supported article on the subject); Jewish\nVirtual Library, Nazi Persecution of the Mentally and Physically Disabled,\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/disabled.html. (Each Internet site\nmentioned in this Dissent was last accessed December 14, 2012.)\n        11\n           As amici curiae Montana Religious Leaders make clear, religious organizations\nare not in unanimous agreement concerning the rights of same-sex couples. Compare\nAmicus Curiae Br. of Mont. Catholic Conf. and Other Christian Churches (opposing\nPlaintiffs’ claim), with Br. of Amici Curiae “Montana Religious Leaders” (supporting\nPlaintiffs’ claim because, “like all Montanans, gay and lesbian Montanans deserve to be\ntreated with dignity and afforded equal rights and protections under the law”).\n        12\n           As a former member of the Catholic Church, I find it somewhat incongruous\nthat while the Montana Catholic Conference leads the charge here against the same-sex\ncouples, the Church is an institution that is itself burdened with a history of marginalizing\nwomen and facilitating the sexual abuse of children. The literature on this subject is\n                                            117\n\f¶191 Before proceeding, I should note that what follows is not an attack on religion, and\n\nI make no pretense of being a theologian. That the Marriage Amendment embodies a\n\nbiblical abhorrence of homosexuality is, in my view, apparent from the testimony and\n\nevidence in the Perry case, discussed above, and from a casual reading of the Bible’s\n\nteachings against homosexuality, discussed below.\n\n¶192 While the historical Jesus, notably, had absolutely nothing to say on the subject,\n\nthere are passing references to homosexuality in Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10,\n\nprodigious, and I make no attempt to cite all of it here. The following resources confirm\nmy observations in this regard: The City University of New York, John Jay College of\nCriminal Justice, The Nature and Scope of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests\nand Deacons in the United States 1950-2002 (Feb. 2004), http://www.bishop-\naccountability.org/reports/2004_02_27_JohnJay_revised/2004_02_27_John_Jay_Main_R\neport_Optimized.pdf; Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine\nHuman Values, 199-201 n. 14 (Free Press 2010); Catholic Sex Abuse Cases,\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases (a thoroughly annotated article on\nthe subject); Sandra M.

Times (Apr. 5,\n2012); Doctrinal Assessment of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious,\nhttp://www.usccb.org/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=55544.\n        In a similar vein, while officially condemning homosexuality, the Boy Scouts of\nAmerica, a federally chartered organization, incongruously maintained a different\napproach in dealing with pedophile adult scout leaders and volunteers. For decades, the\norganization maintained secret “perversion files,” failed to report incidents of child\nsexual abuse to legal authorities, covered up sexual abuse reports, handled sexual abuse\nclaims “in house” via face-saving measures, and facilitated the sexual abuse of children\nby allowing pedophiles excluded from the scouting program in one state to reenter the\nprogram in a different state (not unlike the approach of the Catholic Church, as noted\nabove. See Petula Dvorak, In Boy Scouts’ “Perversion Files,” Vivid Details on the Child\nMolesters among Us, Washington Post (Oct. 26, 2012); Paul Duggan, Boy Scout\n“Perversion Files” Released, Washington Post (Oct. 18, 2012); Bob Rogers, Montana\nand Wyoming Men Identified in Boy Scouts’ “Perversion File,” Billings Gazette (Oct.\n18, 2012); PRWeb, Monumental Boy Scouts Child Sex Abuse Report Released,\nhttp://www.prweb.com/releases/prwebboy-scouts/child-sex-abuse/prweb10134925.htm\n(Nov. 15, 2012).\n                                          118\n\fI Timothy 1:10, and Jude 1:7 (New King James Version). The primary condemnations of\n\nhomosexuality, however, are taken from the Genesis story of Sodom and Gomorrah, and\n\nfrom the rules set out in Leviticus. In the former, God sends two angles in the form of\n\nmen to the home of Lot to warn him of God’s impending punishment of the townspeople.\n\nThe Sodomites surround Lot’s house demanding to “know” (i.e., have carnal knowledge\n\nof) the two men. Lot declines and, instead, offers up his two daughters to the mob. But\n\nwhen that ploy fails, the angels strike the townsmen blind. Lot, his wife Sarah, and his\n\ntwo daughters then flee the city. Along the way, Sarah is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot\n\neventually takes up residence in a cave with his two daughters, where he gets drunk and\n\nimpregnates them both.      Genesis 19:1-36.       Many believe this story reflects God’s\n\ncondemnation of homosexuality, and they thus equate “Sodomite” with “homosexual.” I\n\nnote, though, that in Ezekiel 16:49-50, the sins of Sodom are identified as pride, gluttony,\n\nsloth, greed, arrogance, and failure to help the poor.\n\n¶193 The references to homosexuality in Leviticus are part of the so-called “Holiness\n\nCode.”       See   Luther    Seminary,     Leviticus     17-27   –   The   Holiness   Code,\n\nhttp://www.enterthebible.org/resourcelink.aspx?rid=377. Leviticus explicitly condemns\n\nhomosexuality: “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.”\n\nLeviticus, 18:22; see also Leviticus, 20:13 (“If a man lies with a male as he lies with a\n\nwoman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death.\n\nTheir blood shall be upon them.”). It should also be noted, however, that Leviticus sets\n\nforth a number of other rules that presumably made sense to a primitive nomadic culture\n\nthousands of years ago but that modern society would certainly question, if not outright\n\n                                             119\n\fignore. Indeed, it seems absurd to consider an amendment to Montana’s Constitution\n\nauthorizing the possession of slaves (Leviticus 25:44), or requiring the burning of animals\n\nas a sacrifice to God (Leviticus 1:2-17), or prohibiting intercourse with menstruating\n\nwomen (Leviticus 15:19-24), or prohibiting the consumption of shellfish (Leviticus\n\n11:10-12), or prohibiting a blind or lame person from approaching the altar of God\n\n(Leviticus, 21:18-20), or prohibiting the trimming of one’s hair, especially at the temples\n\n(Leviticus 19:27), or prohibiting any contact with or consumption of dead pigs (Leviticus\n\n11:7-8), or prohibiting the planting of two different crops in the same field (Leviticus\n\n19:19), or prohibiting the wearing of mixed linen and wool (Leviticus 19:19), or requiring\n\nthe stoning of those who blaspheme (Leviticus 24:10-16).\n\n¶194 As already stated, this is not meant to disparage or trivialize biblical teachings. In\n\nterms of sectarian doctrine and ritual, people have the right to believe and practice\n\nwhatever they choose. That is the very essence of the constitutional protection of the\n\n“free exercise” of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I; Mont. Const. art. II, § 5; Thomas v.\n\nRev. Bd. of Ind. Empl. Sec.

Such amendments would clearly run afoul of Article II,\n\nSections 4, 3, and 7, respectively (not to mention their counterparts in the federal\n\nConstitution). Such amendments would themselves be inherently unconstitutional.\n\n¶198 In the same fashion, the people do not have the power to constitutionalize religious\n\ndoctrine. Again, by way of example, the people could not adopt an amendment that\n\nrequired all church worship services to be conducted on Sunday, or that denied certain\n\ngovernmental services to persons who were not “born again,” or that prohibited women\n\nfrom being ordained as ministers. And for the same reasons, religious teachings that\n\nhomosexuality is a sin cannot be made part of Montana’s secular law—as the proponents\n\nof CI-96 have attempted to do through the Marriage Amendment. The Achilles heel of\n\nthe Marriage Amendment is that it is the wolf of constitutionalized religious doctrine\n\nparading in the sheep-suit of social policy.\n\n¶199 Unlike the Marriage Amendment, Article II, Section 5 is a “fundamental right.”\n\nKortum-Managhan v.

Thus, when the State, through the initiative process,\n\n“makes a law” that serves no purpose other than to codify a religious canon—here, select\n\nportions of Genesis and Leviticus—the State clearly violates Article II, Section 5. One\n\ncan only imagine the uproar if the State began incorporating doctrines from the Koran or\n\nsome other religion’s sacred text into the Constitution. Yet, that is precisely what the\n\nMarriage Amendment did. Through the initiative process, the State constitutionalized the\n\nbiblical abhorrence for homosexuality by prohibiting same-sex couples not only from\n\nmarrying but, according to the State and its amici, from enjoying any sort of legal\n\nprotection for their relationships. Such protections are instead to be reserved to the\n\nbiblically favored class of different-sex couples.\n\n¶200 The Bible’s condemnation of homosexuality aside, marriage clearly has—and has\n\nhad for centuries—two separate components. There is the sectarian component: Various\n\nreligions have doctrines, rituals, and proscriptions regarding marriage. Under the Free\n\nExercise Clause, religions may choose to adopt any desired beliefs, practices, or rituals\n\n(within reason 13). See St. John’s, 252 Mont. at 523, 830 P.2d at 1276; Griffith v.

If some religious\n\ninstitutions wish to condemn same-sex relationships, they are free to do so. Conversely,\n\n       13\n          Under prevailing law, religions—at least in this country—cannot sanction\nincest, female genital mutilation, polygamy, honor killing, and similar practices, even if\nsuch practices are divinely inspired.\n                                            123\n\fif others wish to perform same-sex marriages, they likewise are free to do so. Article II,\n\nSection 5 guarantees that each religion may adhere to its own doctrines, practices, and\n\nrituals. Under Article II, Section 5, the State cannot force any religion or sectarian\n\norganization to perform same-sex weddings or to recognize same-sex marriages, nor can\n\nit penalize any religion or sectarian organization for refusing to do so—Proponent’s\n\nnonsensical statements in the 2004 Voter Information Pamphlet to the contrary\n\nnotwithstanding.\n\n¶201 The right of citizens to practice their religious beliefs is not what is at issue here,\n\nhowever. It is the other component of marriage—the secular component—that is at issue.\n\nLike many other states, Montana permits people to marry without the involvement of any\n\ninstitutionalized religion or sectarian organization. People may choose to marry in a\n\ncompletely civil ceremony. See § 40-1-301(1), MCA (“A marriage may be solemnized\n\nby a judge of a court of record, by a public official whose powers include solemnization\n\nof marriages, by a mayor, city judge, or justice of the peace, by a tribal judge, or in\n\naccordance with any mode of solemnization recognized by any religious denomination,\n\nIndian nation or tribe, or native group.”).       Importantly, what brings the marriage\n\nrelationship into existence in the eyes of the law is the properly executed marriage license\n\nissued by the State and the completion of certain medical tests and legal prerequisites.\n\nSee Title 40, chapter 1, parts 1 and 2, MCA; §§ 40-1-301(1), -321, -322, MCA. This is\n\nso regardless of the ceremony or ritual performed and regardless of who performs it. 14\n\n\n       14\n         Montana also recognizes common-law marriage and marriage performed by\n“declaration” without solemnization. See § 40-1-403, MCA. Common-law and declared\n                                            124\n\f“[L]aw (federal or state) is not concerned with holy matrimony. Government deals with\n\nmarriage as a civil status . . . . A state may enforce and dissolve a couple’s marriage, but\n\nit cannot sanctify or bless it. For that, the pair must go next door.” 15 Windsor v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis in original).\n\n¶202 With the governmentally created and licensed relationship, there also springs into\n\nexistence the various benefits and obligations at issue here. There is no religion or\n\nreligious institution in Montana that can create, provide, or deny statutory benefits and\n\nprotections incident to marriage. Only the State can do that. Certainly the State could\n\nchoose to provide no benefits at all for married couples. Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at\n\n426 (“the constitutional right to marry clearly does not obligate the state to afford specific\n\ntax or other governmental benefits on the basis of a couple’s family relationship”).\n\nIndeed, the State concedes in its brief that there is “no constitutional or judicially\n\nenforceable mandate for the Legislature to provide or fund spousal benefits.” 16 But the\n\npoint of this case is that the State has decided to make various benefits available to\n\ndifferent-sex couples, who may obtain them by marrying in either sectarian or secular\n\nceremonies, but has not made the same sorts of benefits available to same-sex couples\n\nwho, by reason of the Marriage Amendment, cannot marry. Although the same-sex\n\ncouples here do not claim the right to marry—acknowledging that the Marriage\n\nmarriages each have their own peculiar legal, but nonreligious, prerequisites. See In re\nMarriage of Swanner-Renner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888987\"><a href=\"/opinion/888987/in-re-marriage-of-swanner-renner/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 17, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888987\"><a href=\"/opinion/888987/in-re-marriage-of-swanner-renner/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888987\"><a href=\"/opinion/888987/in-re-marriage-of-swanner-renner/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(common-law marriage); §§ 40-1-311 to -313 and -323 to -324 (declaration of marriage).\n       15\n          The court may have been referring to St. Andrews Roman Catholic Church,\nwhich is located next door to the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse.\n       16\n          While the State’s amici apparently take a different view, they have cited no\nauthority whatsoever for their premise that the State is required to grant such benefits.\n                                             125\n\fAmendment has denied them that ability—they do demand, and rightly so, that their\n\ngovernment accord them at least the benefits and protections provided to different-sex\n\nmarried couples in the State’s secular laws.\n\n¶203 In denying Plaintiffs these protections through the conduit of the Marriage\n\nAmendment, the State conflates religious canons regarding marriage with the State’s own\n\ncivil laws. This is patently unconstitutional. When the State chooses to enact secular\n\nlaws for the benefit of different-sex couples, but at the same time denies equal protection\n\nof those laws to same-sex couples because of sectarian proscriptions constitutionalized in\n\nthe Marriage Amendment, the State is engaged in blatant discrimination grounded in\n\nreligious doctrine. This sort of discrimination is unlawful not only under Article II,\n\nSection 5, but also under Article II, Section 4 (“Neither the state nor any person, firm,\n\ncorporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil\n\nor political rights on account of . . . religious ideas.”).   Indeed, when, on the basis of\n\nreligious doctrine, the State denies committed intimate same-sex couples the secular\n\nbenefits and civil rights incidental to the status of marriage, the State is guilty of at least\n\nthree abuses of the Constitution: the Equal Protection and Nondiscrimination Clauses of\n\nArticle II, Section 4; the Dignity Clause of Article II, Section 4; and the Establishment\n\nClause of Article II, Section 5.\n\n¶204 Before concluding this discussion, I have two final observations. First, to credit\n\nthe implicit (and explicit) fears expressed in the amicus briefs of the religious and “family\n\nvalues” organizations, one is led to believe that same-sex marriages are going to\n\noverwhelm (or dilute, as the State puts it) the now heterosexually dominated institution.\n\n                                               126\n\fThese fears are completely irrational. Indeed, were it not for its religious underpinnings,\n\nsuch homophobia would be bizarre.        For one thing, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and\n\ntransgender community is a relatively small minority. A Gallup report published in\n\nOctober 2012 reported that, nationally, 3.4 percent of U.S. adults answered “yes” when\n\nasked if they identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.       Of the remaining,\n\n92.2 percent answered “no” and 4.4 percent refused to answer or answered “don’t know.”\n\nRacial and ethnic minorities were more likely than white Americans to identify as\n\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender: 4.6 percent of African Americans, 4.3 percent of\n\nAsians, 4.0 percent of Hispanics, and 3.2 percent of Caucasians. And younger Americans\n\n(age 18 to 29) were more likely than seniors (age 65 and older) to identify as lesbian, gay,\n\nbisexual, or transgender: 6.4 percent versus 1.9 percent, respectively. See Gary J. Gates\n\n& Frank Newport, Special Report: 3.4% of U.S. Adults Identify as LGBT, http://www\n\n.gallup.com/poll/158066/special-report-adults-identify-lgbt.aspx (Oct. 18, 2012); Gary J.\n\nGates & Frank Newport, Gallup Special Report: The U.S. Adult LGBT Population,\n\nhttp://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/gallup-\n\nspecial-report-18oct-2012. Furthermore, in 2010, same-sex couples comprised a mere\n\n1 percent of all “couple” households in the United States. See U.S. Census, Same-Sex\n\nCouple Households, at 1 (Sep. 2011), http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acsbr10-\n\n03.pdf. Permitting these couples to enjoy their full measure of civil rights—much less\n\nmarry—would not denigrate the “institution of marriage” one iota. There is no actual\n\nevidence supporting the threat of ruination of families, businesses, churches, and\n\nchildrearing in the irreversibly horrendous ways predicted. Indeed, the evidence is to the\n\n                                            127\n\fcontrary, as already discussed. The scare tactics, misinformation, and propaganda used\n\nby the promoters of the Marriage Amendment were then, and remain now, not only false,\n\nbut patently absurd as well.\n\n¶205 Second, the institution of marriage has been and is, of course, completely\n\ndominated by heterosexuals. However, for all of the sanctimonious hyperbole about the\n\none-man/one-woman marital relationship, the nationwide rates of divorces in 1990, 2000,\n\nand 2009 were 48 percent, 49 percent, and 50 percent, respectively, relative to the rate of\n\nmarriages performed those same years. In Montana, the numbers were even higher:\n\n59 percent, 58 percent, and 55 percent, respectively. See U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical\n\nAbstract of the United States: 2012, at 98 (2011), http://www.census.gov/compendia/\n\nstatab.   Those who insist on the nuclear mother-father-children model appear to be\n\nwholly detached from the reality of modern America. While the number of “family\n\nhouseholds” increased 8 percent between 2000 and 2010, the percentage of such\n\nhouseholds falling into the “husband-wife with own children” category dropped from\n\n35 percent in 2000 to 30 percent in 2010. See U.S. Census Bureau, Households and\n\nFamilies: 2010, at 4-5 (Apr. 2012), http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-\n\n14.pdf. In 2004, 58 percent of children lived with their married, biological parents, down\n\nfrom 60 percent in 2001 and 61 percent in 1996. See U.S. Census Bureau, Living\n\nArrangements of Children: 2004, at 4 (Feb. 2008), http://www.census.gov/prod/\n\n2008pubs/p70-114.pdf. The “Beaver Cleaver” family of the 1950s simply does not\n\nrepresent modern America, and is not likely to be resurrected given the demographics,\n\ndemands, and exigencies of contemporary life in this country. In any event, if sectarian\n\n                                           128\n\fand “family values” organizations are intent on preserving the sanctity of marriage, it\n\nseems that their efforts and resources would be better spent focusing on the damage that\n\nheterosexuals are inflicting on the institution, rather than the imagined threat that\n\nhomosexuals and bisexuals supposedly pose. Furthermore, if those organizations are\n\nsetting out to reform American “morality” to the dictates of their own religious beliefs\n\nand to create a sort of Christian theocracy in this country not unlike the Islamic\n\ntheocracies prevalent in certain Middle Eastern countries, then they ought to candidly\n\ndisclose that fact rather than hiding behind the thoroughly disproved notion that reserving\n\nmarriage to different-sex couples is necessary for the protection of children and essential\n\nfor our survival as a nation.\n\n¶206 In conclusion, assuming for the sake of argument that it is even applicable in this\n\ncase, the Marriage Amendment cannot justify the State’s approach.             The Marriage\n\nAmendment is simply constitutionalized religious doctrine, and it cannot serve as a\n\nconduit for providing discretionary statutory benefits to some committed intimate couples\n\nwhile denying them to others. The benefits and obligations which the State creates under\n\nits secular law must not first be filtered through the sieve of religious doctrine in order to\n\nsee who gets what. Article II, Section 5 ensures the separation of church and state. The\n\nconstitutional quid pro quo is this: While the State is not permitted to be involved in the\n\nworkings of religious institutions, neither is the State permitted to enforce the doctrines,\n\ncanons, mandates, or proscriptions of any religion or sectarian organization. The State\n\nmay not “target” a class of individuals for disparate treatment in order to advance a\n\nreligious purpose or doctrine, without violating the Establishment Clause.\n\n                                             129\n\f                                   VI. CONCLUSION\n\n¶207 There are many who believe that gays and lesbians are second-class citizens; that\n\nthey are morally inferior; that they are objects worthy of societal scorn, derision, and\n\nhatred; that they may be reviled and demonized on the floor of the Legislature with\n\nimpunity; that they may be discriminated against by local governments; that they may be\n\nbullied in their schools and workplaces; and that they are not entitled to the same rights\n\naccorded to heterosexuals. Such views parallel those held by many—even the United\n\nStates Supreme Court—regarding racial minorities and women a century ago. Dred Scott\n\nv.

Ever!\n\n¶209 It may be argued that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Montanans theoretically have won\n\na token victory today. But that simply is not the case. Their victory, if any, must yet be\n\ndetermined in the multitude of lawsuits that will have to be filed in the District Court here\n\nand in other trial courts. I doubt that any of these citizens will have the time, the money,\n\nor the fortitude to wage the required litigation jihad against their own government simply\n\nto obtain the same rights that their heterosexual fellow citizens enjoy. Realistically the\n\nPlaintiffs here have gained nothing. The problem, it should be noted, is not with their\n\ncounsel, who have done an excellent job of researching, briefing, and arguing the issues\n\nin this case. The problem, rather, is that this Court has chosen to punt. And in simply\n\nkicking the can down the road, the Court has denied Plaintiffs the dignity, respect,\n\nfairness, justice, and equality to which they are entitled—foremost as human beings, and\n\nlegally under Montana’s Constitution.\n\n                                            131\n\f¶210 Sexual orientation is a big deal to those who demand that their personal religious\n\nbeliefs, their Bible’s abhorrence, and their partisan ideology concerning homosexuality\n\nmust apply to everyone else, across the board, no exceptions. But future generations—\n\nindeed, most young people today—will not fear, much less honor, the sexual-orientation\n\ntaboo. The taboo will die because of education, science, 17 and changing social mores,\n\nand because of the small, real victories that lesbian, gay, and bisexual citizens have won.\n\nSee e.g. Gryczan v.

Most importantly, though, the taboo will die because the scare\n\ntactics, propaganda, and misinformation of those who would hang on to the maledictions\n\nand stereotypes have proven to be so patently false, malicious, and absurd. Most decent\n\npeople just hate being lied to. Indeed, a not-too-distant generation of Montanans will\n\nconsign today’s decision, the Marriage Amendment, and the underlying intolerance to the\n\ndustbin of history and to the status of a meaningless, shameful, artifact.\n\n                                         Epilogue\n\n¶211 This will be my last opportunity to sit as a member of this Court on a case\n\ninvolving the fight for the dignity and the civil and human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual,\n\nand transgender people. I had hoped—indeed, believed—that the work this Court started\n\n15 years ago in Gryczan would be brought to fruition and successfully concluded with\n\n\n       17\n         Indeed, with every advancement in science, religion loses ground. The more\nhumans learn and understand about the laws that actually control the universe, the less is\ntheir need to rely on gods, miracles, and myths to explain that which they do not\nunderstand.\n                                            132\n\four decision in this case. Sadly, that is not to be. As I have, I can strenuously disagree\n\nwith this Court’s decision. Regrettably, however, I have been unsuccessful in doing more\n\nthan that. I know how frustrating today’s decision must be for the committed same-sex\n\ncouples and for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Montanans across this State.\n\n¶212 Our collective frustration and sadness aside, however, if we have learned anything\n\nas an evolving species, it is that no government, no religion, no institution, and no\n\npolitical party can long oppress the inviolable dignity and spirit of human beings in their\n\nfight for fairness in the courts, access to justice, and equal protection of the laws. Those\n\nare the seminal principles upon which our country was founded, and they are the\n\nbirthright of every natural person on this planet, without exception. Those rights will not\n\nbe long denied to those suffering the scourge of discrimination and hatred.             The\n\ncommitted couples here—and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Montanans\n\neverywhere—must never lose sight of the fact that although today’s battle has been lost,\n\nthe war has not been. They must remain united in defeat because, in the end, they will\n\novercome; they will prevail. Of that, I am absolutely certain.\n\n¶213 For the foregoing reasons, I strenuously dissent.\n\n\n\n                                                  /S/ JAMES C.
