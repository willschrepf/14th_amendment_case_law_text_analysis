Because there is no evidence that the acts in question are expressive, we hold that the Free Speech Clause does not apply. We further hold, however, that the Borough's selective enforcement of its ordinance likely violated the Free Exercise Clause. Because the other requirements for injunctive relief are satisfied, we reverse and direct the District Court to issue a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ordinance in the Borough of Tenafly, which encompasses 4.4 square miles and has a population of 13,806,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> provides in pertinent part: \"No person shall place any sign or advertisement, or other matter upon any pole, tree, curbstone, sidewalk or elsewhere, in any public street or public place, excepting such as may be authorized by this or any other ordinance of the Borough.\" Tenafly, N.J., Ordinance 691 Article VIII(7) (1954).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Although Ordinance 691 does not allow Borough officials to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, in practice they have often done so. House number signs nailed to utility poles in plain view are frequently left in place. Local churches are tacitly allowed to post permanent directional signs bearing crosses on municipal property. Lost animal signs and other private postings often remain undisturbed by Borough officials. Orange ribbons were affixed to utility poles \"for a lengthy period of time\" by supporters of the local high school during a protracted controversy over school regionalization, but Borough officials made no effort to remove them. Every year, officials in the small community permit the local Chamber of Commerce to affix holiday displays to the Borough's utility poles for approximately six weeks during the Christmas holiday season. Red ribbons, wreaths, and seasonal holiday lights are attached to the Borough's utility poles as part of these displays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in this case are Orthodox Jewish residents of Tenafly<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> whose faith forbids them from pushing or carrying objects outside their homes on the Sabbath or Yom Kippur.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In accordance with a religious convention practiced by Orthodox Jews for over two thousand years, however, the plaintiffs believe they may engage in such activities outside their homes on the Sabbath within an <i>eruv,</i> a ceremonial demarcation of an area. <i>Tenafly Eruv Ass'n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly,</i> 155 F.Supp.2d 142, 146 (D.N.J.2001). An <i>eruv</i> extends the space within which pushing and carrying is permitted on the Sabbath beyond the boundaries of the home, thereby enabling, for example, the plaintiffs to push baby strollers and wheelchairs, and carry canes and walkers, when traveling between home and synagogue. Without an <i>eruv</i> Orthodox Jews who have small children or are disabled typically cannot attend synagogue on the Sabbath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Centuries ago, an <i>eruv</i> would be built using ropes and wooden poles. Today, Orthodox Jews can construct an <i>eruv</i> by attaching <i>lechis</i> &#8212; thin black strips made of the same hard plastic material as, and nearly identical to, the coverings on ordinary ground wires &#8212; vertically along utility poles. Along with preexisting horizontal overhead utility lines, the <i>lechis</i> designate an <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Unless one knows which black plastic strips are <i>lechis</i> and which are utility wires, it is \"absolutely impossible\" to distinguish the two. <i>Id.</i> at 149. Throughout this litigation, the plaintiffs have maintained that an <i>eruv</i> (as well as each constituent lechi) is \"not a religious symbol,\" but rather is an item with \"religious significance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 148.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1999, Erez Gotlieb and Gary Osen, two Orthodox Jews who are not parties to this case, met with Tenafly Mayor Ann Moscovitz to discuss creating an <i>eruv</i> in the Borough. Gotlieb and Osen met with Moscovitz because under Orthodox Jewish law an <i>eruv</i> is not valid unless a civil official with jurisdiction over the circumscribed area issues a ceremonial proclamation \"renting\" the area for a nominal fee (<i>e.g.,</i> one dollar). The Mayor said she lacked authority to issue the requested proclamation, but agreed to bring the matter to the attention of the Borough Council, the Borough's legislative branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> She did not mention Ordinance 691 or suggest that affixing <i>lechis</i> to utility poles might violate any other ordinance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the next Council meeting, on July 8, 1999, the Council and approximately thirty Tenafly residents debated whether the Borough should grant the proclamation. Many of those present expressed vehement objections prompted by their fear that an <i>eruv</i> would encourage Orthodox Jews to move to Tenafly. A Council member whom the District Court was unable to identify noted \"a concern that the Orthodoxy would take over\" Tenafly. <i>Id.</i> at 151-52. One Council member voiced his \"serious concern\" that \"Ultra-Orthodox\" Jews might \"stone[] cars that drive down the streets on the Sabbath.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153-54. The Borough Attorney participated in the debate. Neither he nor anyone else mentioned Ordinance 691 or indicated that attaching <i>lechis</i> to utility poles might be unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council decided to demand a formal, written proposal before voting on whether to issue the proclamation. Mayor Moscovitz advised Gotlieb and Osen, who did not attend the meeting, that the Council was unlikely to grant their request for a proclamation, but invited them to submit a formal application. Frustrated by the Borough's reticence, in August 1999 TEAI asked Bergen County Executive William P. Schuber, whose jurisdiction includes Tenafly, to issue the ceremonial proclamation necessary to validate the <i>eruv.</i> On December 15, 1999, he did so. The constitutionality of this action is not challenged in this case, and neither Schuber nor any other Bergen County official is a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon, the local telephone company, owns the utility poles in Tenafly, though the poles are located on the Borough's property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In April 2000, the plaintiffs asked Verizon for permission to attach <i>lechis</i> to its utility poles. The plaintiffs said in a sworn statement, which the District Court found \"credible,\" that they did not believe any municipal ordinance prohibited them from doing so, and thus that they did not need the Council's permission. <i>Id.</i> at 155. After the plaintiffs informed Verizon about the proclamation, they say, the company's in-house counsel researched whether municipal approval was required and advised the plaintiffs that it was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2000 Cablevision, holder of the local cable television franchise, volunteered to help the plaintiffs affix <i>lechis</i> to Verizon's utility poles as a community service. With the help of Cablevision personnel and equipment, an <i>eruv</i> was completed in Tenafly sometime in September 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The plaintiffs represent, and the Borough does not disagree, that only private funds have supported the <i>eruv</i> and that no municipal assistance of any kind will be needed to maintain it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borough officials apparently did not learn that an <i>eruv</i> was being erected in Tenafly until late August 2000. Mayor Moscovitz and Councilman Charles Lipson met with two local Jewish leaders on September 14, 2000, to discuss the matter. One of the Jewish leaders perceived some of the Mayor's remarks as derogatory toward Orthodox Jews, and the meeting was unproductive. Twelve days later, Borough Administrator Joseph DiGiacomo, acting at the Mayor's behest, asked Cablevision why it helped attach the <i>lechis</i> without the Borough's permission. According to DiGiacomo, the company told him that \"a Rabbi\" had advised it that TEAI had the necessary government approval. <i>Id.</i> at 158. On October 10, 2000, Mayor Moscovitz and the Council directed the Borough Administrator to ask Cablevision to remove the <i>lechis</i> from the utility poles \"as soon as possible.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 23, 2000, Cablevision wrote to the plaintiffs and informed them that the Borough instructed it to take down the <i>lechis.</i> Cablevision said it would begin complying with the Borough's order within three days unless the plaintiffs demonstrated they had municipal approval. Counsel for the plaintiffs subsequently negotiated from the Borough a thirty-day reprieve to give TEAI an opportunity to apply for permission from the Council to maintain the <i>eruv.</i> The letter setting out this agreement, sent by the plaintiffs' counsel to Borough Attorney Walter Lesnevich, states in part: \"I also appreciate your advice that the Borough has no specific ordinance covering this matter or any particular format for the <i>Eruv</i> Association to follow in submitting its request.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159. By the beginning of November 2000, neither Lesnevich nor any other Borough official had raised the possibility that Ordinance 691 or another ordinance might be relevant to the dispute over the <i>lechis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2000, the plaintiffs filed their application with the Borough, asking the Council not to remove or order the removal of the <i>lechis.</i> On November 21, 2000, the Council decided to hold two hearings to allow members of the public to comment on the plaintiffs' proposal. The Council scheduled the first hearing for November 28, 2000, and the second for December 12, 2000. Fifty-four members of the public, including plaintiff Chaim Book and other <i>eruv</i> proponents, spoke at the two hearings. The speakers were evenly divided between supporters and opponents of the <i>eruv.</i> During the hearings, Council members did not express their views until the conclusion of the December 12 hearing. At that hearing, just before the Council voted on the plaintiffs' application, one Councilman stated that \"[t]o the best of my knowledge,\" the Borough had \"no ordinance, no resolution that says that you cannot hang something from a utility pole.\" Mayor Moscovitz responded by saying \"[t]here is an ordinance,\" and Lesnevich then described Ordinance 691. This exchange was apparently the first time that Borough officials mentioned Ordinance 691 with regard to the <i>lechis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Lesnevich brought Ordinance 691 to the Council members' attention, the Council voted 5-0 to force the plaintiffs to remove the <i>lechis.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The next day, the Borough ordered Cablevision to take the <i>lechis</i> off the utility poles \"as soon as possible.\" 155 F.Supp.2d at 163. The plaintiffs responded by suing in the District Court on December 15, 2000, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, and the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3604(a), and seeking an injunction barring the Borough from interfering with the <i>eruv.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the District Court issued a temporary restraining order precluding the Borough from disturbing the <i>eruv.</i> Consent orders extended the duration of the restraint until the Court ruled on the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. After the parties completed limited discovery, the Court held an evidentiary hearing that spanned four days, received additional affidavits, and heard oral arguments. On August 10, 2001, the Court issued an opinion denying the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief on the ground that they are not reasonably likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's discussion began with the plaintiffs' claim that the Borough violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. The Court concluded (albeit without citing our decision in <i>Troster v. Pennsylvania State Department of Corrections,</i> 65 F.3d 1086 (3d Cir.1995)) that the act of affixing <i>lechis</i> to utility poles is \"symbolic speech.\" 155 F.Supp.2d at 173. Next the Court determined that the Borough's utility poles are a nonpublic forum, and that the Borough did not discriminate against the plaintiffs' religious viewpoint when it ordered the <i>lechis</i> removed. <i>Id.</i> at 174-80. The Court acknowledged that the Borough had expressly or tacitly permitted various facial violations of Ordinance 691,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> such as the holiday displays and church directional signs. But it distinguished the <i>lechis,</i> reasoning that the other materials affixed to the utility poles served commercial or functional purposes, were not religious in nature, and were not intended to be attached permanently. <i>Id.</i> at 176-78. Other items frequently affixed to utility poles in violation of Ordinance 691, such as the lost animal signs and permanently attached house numbers, did not show discriminatory enforcement because the Borough said it made efforts to remove some of them after the plaintiffs sued. <i>Id.</i> at 177-78. As for the orange ribbons, the Court stated that, notwithstanding Mayor Moscovitz's testimony and other evidence in the record, it \"lack[ed] sufficient information\" to find that the Borough knew about and tacitly approved them. <i>Id.</i> at 177. The Court concluded that the Borough's application of the ordinance did not discriminate against the plaintiffs' religious viewpoint, and thus their free speech claim could not succeed. <i>Id.</i> at 180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the Borough violated the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 180-86. The Court disagreed with the plaintiffs' position that the objective effect of the Borough's decision was to discriminate against religiously motivated activity. It noted that, under <i>Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n,</i> 485 U.S. 439, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988), the Borough can deny access to utility poles on its land for a religion-neutral reason even if doing so imposes an \"incidental\" burden on Orthodox Jews' ability to practice their religion. 155 F.Supp.2d at 180-81. The Court reasoned that because the Borough ordered the <i>lechis</i> taken down pursuant to Ordinance 691, \"a pre-existing, neutral law of general applicability,\" the issue was controlled by the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Employment Division v. Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), rather than by its subsequent decision in <i>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah,</i> 508 U.S. 520, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993). 155 F.Supp.2d at 181. The Court did not consider whether its earlier conclusion that Borough officials chose not to enforce Ordinance 691 with respect to some secularly motivated commercial and functional postings, <i>see id.</i> at 177-80, affected the free exercise analysis. Under Smith, the District Court reasoned, the Borough Council's decision to enforce Ordinance 691 against the <i>eruv</i> had an objectively neutral effect that did not implicate the Free Exercise Clause. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court thought, however, that the Council members' improper subjective motivations nonetheless necessitated strict scrutiny under <i>Lukumi. Id.</i> at 183. It found that, while the Council members had no religious animosity, they acted because of the \"constitutionally impermissible\" fear that the <i>eruv</i> would facilitate the formation of an insular Orthodox Jewish \"community within a community\" in Tenafly. <i>Id.</i> at 182-83. Nevertheless, no Free Exercise Clause violation occurred because the Council members' decision was \"narrowly tailored to further their interest in avoiding the <i>appearance</i> of an Establishment Clause concern.\" <i>Id.</i> at 184 n. 26 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Court held that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue under the FHA because the Borough did not \"make unavailable or deny\" housing within the meaning of the relevant provision, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3604(a). <i>Id.</i> at 186-90. Every case finding a violation of &#167; 3604(a), the District Court noted, involved conduct that \"directly affected the availability of housing,\" whereas the plaintiffs seek a \"non-housing use of municipal property.\" <i>Id.</i> at 187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court concluded that, because the plaintiffs were not reasonably likely to succeed on any of their claims, injunctive relief was not appropriate. The plaintiffs timely appealed, giving us jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and we granted their request for an injunction prohibiting removal of the <i>lechis</i> pending our decision. <i>Tenafly Eruv Ass'n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly,</i> No. 01-3301 (3d Cir. Sept. 19, 2001) (order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the District Court's ultimate decision to deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. See <i>Dam Things from Denmark, a/k/a Troll Co. ApS, v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co.,</i> 290 F.3d 548, 556 (3d Cir.2002); <i>St. Thomas-St. John Hotel &amp; Tourism Ass'n, Inc. v. Virgin Islands,</i> 218 F.3d 232, 235 (3d Cir.2000). But \"`any determination that is a prerequisite to the issuance of an injunction... is reviewed according to the standard applicable to that particular determination.'\" <i>Southco, Inc. v. Kanebridge Corp.,</i> 258 F.3d 148, 150-51 (3d Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Winback and Conserve Program, Inc.,</i> 42 F.3d 1421, 1427 (3d Cir.1994)). Thus \"we exercise plenary review over the District Court's conclusions of law and its application of the law to the facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 151 (quoting <i>Duraco Prods., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enters., Ltd.,</i> 40 F.3d 1431, 1438 (3d Cir.1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily we will not disturb the factual findings supporting the disposition of a preliminary injunction motion in the absence of clear error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <i>Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharm. Co.,</i> 290 F.3d 578, 586 (3d Cir.2002); <i>S. Camden Citizens in Action v. N.J. Dep't of Envtl. Protection,</i> 274 F.3d 771, 777 (3d Cir.2001). This case, however, involves First Amendment claims, and \"the reaches of the First Amendment are ultimately defined by the facts it is held to embrace.\" <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 567, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995). Therefore, we have \"a constitutional duty to conduct an independent examination of the record as a whole,\" and we cannot defer to the District Court's factual findings unless they concern witnesses' credibility. <i>Id.</i>; <i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 499, 510-11, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984); <i>Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth.,</i> 148 F.3d 242, 247 (3d Cir.1998). Accordingly, we examine independently the facts in the record and \"draw our own inferences\" from them. <i>Christ's Bride,</i> 148 F.3d at 247.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four factors governed the District Court's decision whether to issue a preliminary injunction barring the Borough from removing the <i>eruv.</i> To obtain an injunction, the plaintiffs had to demonstrate (1) that they are reasonably likely to prevail eventually in the litigation and (2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable injury without relief. <i>See S. Camden Citizens,</i> 274 F.3d at 777; <i>Adams v. Freedom Forge Corp.,</i> 204 F.3d 475, 484 (3d Cir.2000). If these two threshold showings are made the District Court then considers, to the extent relevant, (3) whether an injunction would harm the Borough more than denying relief would harm the plaintiffs and (4) whether granting relief would serve the public interest. <i>See S. Camden Citizens,</i> 274 F.3d at 777; <i>Freedom Forge,</i> 204 F.3d at 484. Because the District Court ended its analysis after concluding that the plaintiffs did not show that their claims are reasonably likely to succeed, <i>see</i> 155 F.Supp.2d at 171, 191, our discussion focuses on that factor. Disposing of the plaintiffs' FHA claim in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> we will first consider the plaintiffs' free speech claim and then discuss their free exercise claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Free Speech Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment's Free Speech Clause provides that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const. amend. I. \"Speech\" is not construed literally, or even limited to the use of words. Constitutional protection is afforded not only to speaking and writing, but also to some nonverbal acts of communication, <i>viz.,</i> \"expressive conduct\" (or \"symbolic speech\"). Affixing <i>lechis</i> to utility poles does not involve the use of words, so the plaintiffs' behavior is protected by the Free Speech Clause only if it constitutes expressive conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conduct is protected by the First Amendment when \"the nature of [the] activity, combined with the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken,\" shows that the \"activity was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the [First Amendment's] scope.\" <i>Spence v. Washington,</i> 418 U.S. 405, 409-10, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974); <i>Troster v. Pa. State Dep't of Corrections,</i> 65 F.3d 1086, 1090 (3d Cir.1995). Context is crucial to evaluating an expressive conduct claim because \"the context may give meaning to the symbol\" or act in question. <i>Spence,</i> 418 U.S. at 410, 94 S.Ct. 2727.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until 1995, the Supreme Court determined whether speech is \"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication\" by asking \"whether `[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.'\" <i>Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (quoting <i>Spence,</i> 418 U.S. at 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727). Applying this two-prong test (the \"<i>Spence-Johnson</i> test\"), the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment shelters certain forms of nonverbal communication. For instance, <i>Johnson</i> held that burning an American flag as part of a demonstration against the Reagan Administration's policies that coincided with the 1984 Republican Party convention was \"speech\" because its \"expressive, overtly political nature\" was \"both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent\" to the protestors' audience. 491 U.S. at 399, 406, 109 S.Ct. 2533. Similarly, <i>Spence</i> held that attaching a peace symbol to an American flag and displaying the \"peace flag\" upside down was protected expression. The actor \"testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and displayed it to public view as a protest against the invasion of Cambodia and the killings at Kent State University, events which occurred a few days prior to his arrest,\" and \"it would have been difficult for the great majority of citizens to miss the drift of appellant's point at the time that he made it.\" 418 U.S. at 408, 410, 94 S.Ct. 2727. Additional types of nonverbal communication have also been deemed constitutionally protected. <i>See, e.g., Schacht v. United States,</i> 398 U.S. 58, 62-63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970) (wearing United States military uniforms as part of theatrical presentation opposing Vietnam War); <i>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community Sch. Dist.,</i> 393 U.S. 503, 505-06, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969) (wearing black armband at school to protest Vietnam War); <i>W. Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 632, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (saluting the American flag to show allegiance to the United States); <i>Stromberg v. California,</i> 283 U.S. 359, 369, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931) (displaying red flag to express opposition to organized government). In other cases, the Court assumed, without deciding, that the nonverbal political demonstrations at issue implicated the First Amendment. <i>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,</i> 468 U.S. 288, 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) (sleeping in a public park in front of the White House and on the Washington Mall, in the middle of winter, to protest homelessness); <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968) (burning Selective Service registration certificate on courthouse steps to protest war).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's unanimous 1995 opinion, <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995), modified somewhat the test for determining when conduct constitutes \"speech.\" In <i>Hurley,</i> a group of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals of Irish ancestry sued under a state public accommodations law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in an attempt to gain admission to a private St. Patrick's Day parade in which an array of disparate groups participated. While the parade organizers asserted their First Amendment right to shape the content of their speech, the plaintiffs maintained that the organizers had no First Amendment interest because their lack of selectivity in accepting participants made it impossible for spectators to discern a specific message. Rejecting the plaintiffs' contention, the Supreme Court explained that \"a narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a `particularized message,' would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollak, music of Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>Id.</i> at 569, 115 S.Ct. 2338 (quoting <i>Spence,</i> 418 U.S. at 411, 94 S.Ct. 2727).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By establishing that \"a private speaker does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices, or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message as the exclusive subject matter of the speech,\" <i>Hurley</i> eliminated the \"particularized message\" aspect of the <i>Spence-Johnson</i> test. <i>Id.</i> at 569-70, 115 S.Ct. 2338. The <i>Hurley</i> Court had no need to formulate a new test, however, because &#8212; unlike conduct that is not normally communicative &#8212; parades are inherently expressive. <i>Id.</i> at 568, 115 S.Ct. 2338 (\"Parades are thus a form of expression, not just motion, and the inherent expressiveness of marching to make a point explains our cases involving protest marches.\"). Thus <i>Hurley</i> left open how courts should evaluate symbolic speech claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before <i>Hurley,</i> we treated the <i>Spence-Johnson</i> factors as prerequisites for conduct to be deemed expressive. <i>See Steirer by Steirer v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist.,</i> 987 F.2d 989, 995, 997 (3d Cir.1993) (holding that participating in community service is not expressive conduct). But after <i>Hurley,</i> our decision in <i>Troster v. Pennsylvania State Department of Corrections,</i> 65 F.3d 1086 (3d Cir.1995), concluded that <i>Spence</i> (and, implicitly, <i>Johnson</i> as well) set signposts rather than requirements, and that its two factors can no longer be viewed as the only criteria. <i>See id.</i> at 1090 &amp; n. 1. Because <i>Spence</i> \"contained no language of necessity,\" we adopted the following standard: conduct is expressive if, \"considering `the nature of[the] activity, combined with the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken,' we are led to the conclusion that the `activity was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1090 (quoting <i>Spence,</i> 418 U.S. at 409-10, 94 S.Ct. 2727) (alteration in original). We emphasized that this \"is a fact-sensitive, context-dependent inquiry,\" and that the putative speaker bears the burden of proving that his or her conduct is expressive. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then applied this formulation to reject a state corrections officer's claim that a regulation mandating that each corrections officer wear an American flag patch on his uniform's right shirt-sleeve, with the star field facing his rear, violated the First Amendment by compelling him to engage in expressive conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 1088. The officer believed that compulsory display debases the flag and that \"displaying the flag with its star field to the rear signifies cowardice and retreat from the principles for which the flag stands.\" <i>Id.</i> Though we recognized the strength of the officer's convictions, we determined that he did not show that the act of wearing a flag patch was sufficiently communicative to receive First Amendment protection, as he did not present \"evidence to support his otherwise bare assertion that the flag patch regulation compels expressive conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1091 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our discussion in <i>Troster</i> focused on two inquiries. First, we examined whether the officer intended subjectively (<i>i.e.,</i> actually intended) for his conduct to communicate to persons whom he expected to observe it (<i>i.e.,</i> his intended audience). We determined that there was no proof that his conduct was \"demonstrative of an attitude or belief\" or that he \"actually assert[ed] anything to anyone.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1091-92. Second, we considered whether observers understood the message the officer intended his conduct to convey. The record contained no evidence that \"observers would likely understand the patch or the wearer to be <i>telling</i> them anything about the wearers' beliefs\" or \"that the flag patch on the correctional officers' uniform will relay any <i>message</i> (ideological or otherwise) to anyone.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1091-92 (emphases in original). Therefore, the officer's compelled speech claim failed because he did not show that the conduct in which he was forced to engage was expressive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our emphasis in <i>Troster</i> on the putative speaker's burden of proving that his conduct is \"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication\" is important to our resolution of the plaintiffs' expressive conduct claim in this case. If the putative speaker's burden were \"limited to `the advancement of a plausible contention' that [his or her] conduct is expressive\" &#8212; a view espoused by a plurality of the D.C. Circuit but rejected by the Supreme Court in <i>Clark</i> &#8212; the result \"would be to create a rule that all conduct is presumptively expressive.\" <i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293 n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065. Such a rule would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court's repeated admonition that \"[w]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled `speech.'\" <i>O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. at 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673; <i>see also Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. at 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533; <i>Spence,</i> 418 U.S. at 409, 94 S.Ct. 2727. Therefore, as we stressed in <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1091-92, and as the Supreme Court held in <i>Clark,</i> \"it is the obligation of the person desiring to engage in assertedly expressive conduct to demonstrate that the First Amendment even applies.\" <i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293 n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this background as context, we conclude that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that affixing <i>lechis</i> to utility poles is \"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication\" to be deemed expressive conduct. The record indicates that the <i>lechis</i> were attached for the benefit of other Orthodox Jews, not the general public. Therefore, if the plaintiffs' conduct is expressive, their intended audience is other Orthodox Jews. But the plaintiffs have not introduced evidence that the <i>lechis</i> are meant to demonstrate a belief or assert anything to Orthodox Jews or that Orthodox Jews \"likely understand\" the <i>eruv</i> \"to be telling them anything,\" <i>i.e.,</i> that they discern \"any message (ideological or otherwise)\" from the <i>lechis.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1091 (emphases in original). Instead, on the record before us, it appears that the <i>eruv</i> serves a purely functional, non-communicative purpose indistinguishable, for free speech purposes, from that of a fence surrounding a yard or a wall surrounding a building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than \"actually assert[ing] anything to anyone,\" <i>id.</i> at 1092, it seems that the <i>eruv</i> simply demarcates the space within which certain activities otherwise forbidden on the Sabbath are allowed. Plaintiff Chaim Book described the <i>eruv</i> as a \"boundary\" that \"requires physical demarcation,\" a function historically achieved by \"rop[ing] an area off.\" Similarly, at oral argument counsel for the plaintiffs told us that the <i>lechis</i> \"replace[] the pole[s] that would be used prior to the time there were telephone poles\" to designate the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries. While the plaintiffs describe the <i>eruv</i> in functional terms, explaining that it establishes an area within which Orthodox Jews may engage in certain otherwise impermissible activities, they offer no evidence that it communicates anything. The only evidence the plaintiffs introduced with respect to the religious significance of the <i>eruv</i> was the affidavit of Rabbi Hershel Schachter of Yeshiva University, an expert on Orthodox Jewish law. Rabbi Schachter explained that the <i>eruv</i> enables couples with young children and persons who use wheelchairs to attend synagogue on the Sabbath. He did not, however, suggest that the Orthodox Jews who affix <i>lechis</i> intend to send any message thereby, or that the <i>eruv</i> conveys any message to Orthodox Jews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, there is no evidence that Orthodox Jews receive a message or ascertain the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries by looking at the <i>lechis.</i> To the contrary, Rabbi Howard Jachter, speaking on behalf of the TEAI, said that \"most Orthodox Jews do not ... would not know how to make an <i>eruv,</i> wouldn't see where the <i>eruv</i> is, how it is. A rabbi wouldn't know how it is.\" Even plaintiff Chaim Book, who is obviously familiar with the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries and the <i>lechis</i>' locations, said, \"I, who know some of the poles have <i>lechis,</i> have a hard time recognizing the lechi on the pole by just looking at it.\" In addition, plaintiffs' complaint states that \"the <i>eruv</i> is not a religious symbol.\" Thus there is no evidence contradicting the Borough's assertion at oral argument &#8212; which the plaintiffs did not dispute &#8212; that Orthodox Jews learn the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries by word of mouth from the persons charged with erecting and inspecting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the plaintiffs had introduced evidence that the <i>lechis</i> serve a boundary function, that would be insufficient to prove they are \"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\" <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1090 (internal quotation marks omitted). All boundary lines delineate the realms within which certain activities are or are not allowed. For instance, the invisible boundary between Nevada and Utah separates an area where gambling is legal from one where it is not. A homeowner's fence demarcates where his neighbor's garden must stop. The walls of a synagogue delineate the space where congregational worship takes place. But geographical boundary lines, fences, and walls are simply not protected expression in the absence of evidence that some \"attitude or belief,\" <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1091, is conveyed or received from them. <i>Cf. Dallas v. Stanglin,</i> 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 104 L.Ed.2d 18 (1989) (\"It is possible to find some kernel of expression in almost every activity a person undertakes &#8212; for example, walking down the street or meeting one's friends at a shopping mall &#8212; but such a kernel is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection of the First Amendment.\"); <i>Pro v. Donatucci,</i> 81 F.3d 1283, 1293 (3d Cir.1996) (Roth, J., dissenting) (noting that \"expression and communication are the crucial attributes of speech,\" that \"[n]owhere is this stress on expression and communication more clear than in the Court's approach to speech that falls outside the traditional domain of the spoken or written word,\" and that \"[t]he classic examples of conduct-as-speech all contain patently expressive messages.\"). Otherwise, the act of constructing houses of worship would implicate the Free Speech Clause, whereas courts consistently analyze the constitutionality of zoning regulations limiting such construction under the Free Exercise Clause, not the Free Speech Clause. <i>See, e.g., City of Boerne v. Flores,</i> 521 U.S. 507, 534, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997); <i>Messiah Baptist Church v. County of Jefferson,</i> 859 F.2d 820, 823-26 (10th Cir.1988); <i>Lakewood, Ohio Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, Inc. v. City of Lakewood,</i> 699 F.2d 303, 307-08 (6th Cir.1983); <i>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Jefferson County,</i> 741 F.Supp. 1522, 1527-34 (N.D.Ala.1990); <i>cf. Congregation Kol Ami v. Abington Township,</i> 2002 WL 31312280 (3d Cir. Oct.16, 2002). Moreover, if solely the act of erecting a wall separating the interior of a building from the secular world constituted \"speech,\" every religious group that wanted to challenge a zoning regulation preventing them from constructing a house of worship could raise a \"hybrid\" rights claim triggering strict scrutiny, <i>see Employment Division v. Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 872, 881-82, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> a notion so astonishing that we are unaware of any court &#8212; or even any law review article &#8212; that has suggested it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs maintain that, although the <i>eruv</i> is functional, it is also expressive, just as the 18-foot Chanukah menorah in <i>Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU,</i> 492 U.S. 573, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989), was expressive even though the functional purpose of menorahs is to hold candles. To the extent that the plaintiffs' point is that functionality and expression are \"not mutually exclusive,\" we do not disagree; things ordinarily used for functional purposes can be used for communicative purposes as well. <i>Name. Space, Inc. v. Network Solutions, Inc.,</i> 202 F.3d 573, 586 (2d Cir.2000) (concluding that Internet domain names are ordinarily functional, but can be expressive if they contain a message, <i>e.g.,</i> \".jones_for_president\"). But there is no evidence that the <i>eruv</i> is an example of such overlapping purposes, whereas there was ample evidence to that effect in <i>Allegheny.</i> As part of a holiday display that stood at the entrance to a government building and included a 45-foot Christmas tree, the 18-foot menorah was both intended and understood to express \"a recognition that Christmas is not the only traditional way of observing the winter-holiday season\" and \"an acknowledgment of Chanukah as a contemporaneous alternative tradition.\" <i>Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 617-18, 109 S.Ct. 3086.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sharp contrast here, there is no evidence that Orthodox Jews intend or understand the <i>eruv</i> to communicate any idea or message. Rather, the evidence shows that the <i>eruv</i> &#8212; like a fence around a house or the walls forming a synagogue &#8212; serves the purely functional purpose of delineating an area within which certain activities are permitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject the plaintiffs' contention that the <i>eruv</i> may be deemed expressive simply because some residents of Tenafly who are not Orthodox Jews discern various <i>unintended</i> messages emanating from it, notwithstanding that these persons would not be intended recipients even if the <i>lechis</i> were meant to send a message. To accept this position would mean that whether conduct is expressive depends entirely on how observers <i>perceive</i> it &#8212; even if the actor had no communicative intent, and even if the actor disapproves of the message (or messages) discerned by the observers. <i>See Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1092 (noting the difference between an observer's independent inference from an actor's behavior and an observer's receipt of a nonverbal message intentionally sent by the actor); Peter Meijes Tiersma, <i>Nonverbal Communication and the Freedom of \"Speech\",</i> 1993 Wis. L.Rev. 1525, 1553, 1561-62 (stating that nonverbal conduct is expressive only if it involves \"a conscious transfer of information,\" <i>i.e.,</i> \"an attempt to communicate\" by the actor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we cannot accept the plaintiffs' argument that, by analogy to the protection afforded newsracks, the <i>eruv</i> is protected under the First Amendment. Relying on <i>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ'g Co.,</i> 486 U.S. 750, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), the plaintiffs insist that, just as newsracks facilitate the distribution of newspapers, the <i>eruv</i> facilitates religious worship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> But <i>City of Lakewood</i> did not treat newsracks as protected based on the sweeping rationale that they facilitate speech, but rather because they are inextricably intertwined with speech. <i>Id.</i> at 768, 108 S.Ct. 2138 (\"The actual `activity' at issue here is the circulation of newspapers, which is constitutionally protected.\"). Unlike a newsrack, which facilitates the paradigm of communication (the sale of newspapers), there is no evidence that the <i>eruv</i> is inextricably linked to a communicative activity. Instead, the record shows that the <i>eruv</i> exists solely to designate the boundaries within which Orthodox Jews can engage in certain activities on the Sabbath. Therefore, <i>City of Lakewood</i> does not support the plaintiffs' position that the non-communicative act of delineating an area constitutes protected expression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, as in <i>Troster,</i> the plaintiffs offer nothing more than a \"bare assertion\" that their conduct is expressive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> 65 F.3d at 1091 n. 4.

On the other hand, if the law is not neutral (<i>i.e.,</i> if it discriminates against religiously motivated conduct) or is not generally applicable (<i>i.e.,</i> if it proscribes particular conduct only or primarily when religiously motivated), strict scrutiny applies and the burden on religious conduct violates the Free Exercise Clause unless it is narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> <i>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.

Accordingly, in situations where government officials exercise discretion in applying a facially neutral law, so that whether they enforce the law depends on their evaluation of the reasons underlying a violator's conduct, they contravene the neutrality requirement if they exempt some secularly motivated conduct but not comparable religiously motivated conduct. <i>See Lukumi,</i> 508 U.S. at 537, 113 S.Ct. 2217; <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. at 884, 110 S.Ct. 1595; <i>Bowen v.

According to the Borough, the controlling principle is that \"`the Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.'\" <i>Northwest Indian Cemetery,</i> 485 U.S. at 451, 108 S.Ct. 1319 (1988) (quoting <i>Sherbert,</i> 374 U.S. at 412, 83 S.Ct. 1790 (Douglas, J., concurring)); <i>Roy,</i> 476 U.S. at 700, 106 S.Ct. 2147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the Borough's position, however, the principle of <i>Lukumi</i> and <i>Fraternal Order of Police</i> &#8212; that government cannot discriminate between religiously motivated conduct and comparable secularly motivated conduct in a manner that devalues religious reasons for acting &#8212; applies not only when a coercive law or regulation prohibits religious conduct, but also when government denies religious adherents access to publicly available money or property. <i>See Sherbert v. Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398, 404-05, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) (holding that Free Exercise Clause prohibits state from devaluing religious reasons for seeking unemployment benefits); <i>Davey v.

Under <i>Smith</i> and <i>Lukumi,</i> however, there is no substantial burden requirement when government discriminates against religious conduct. <i>See Lukumi,</i> 508 U.S. at 531-47, 113 S.Ct. 2217 (finding Free Exercise Clause violation without considering whether a substantial burden on religious freedom existed); <i>Fraternal Order of Police,</i> 170 F.3d at 364-67 (same); <i>Brown v.

Instead, the plaintiffs need to show only \"a sufficient interest in the case to meet the normal requirement of constitutional standing,\" <i>Hartmann v. Stone,</i> 68 F.3d 973, 979 n. 4 (6th Cir.1995) (rejecting substantial burden requirement), and their inability to attend synagogue on the Sabbath without the <i>eruv</i> easily suffices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, <i>Smith</i> admonished courts not to engage in the sort of inquiry the Borough demands.

Horn,</i> 227 F.3d 47, 56 (3d Cir.2000) (<i>en banc</i>) (same). Evaluating the extent of a burden on religious practice is equally impermissible, the <i>Smith</i> Court said, because it entails a forbidden inquiry into religious doctrine. \"`Constitutionally significant burden' would seem to be `centrality' under another name,\" and \"inquiry into `severe impact' is no different from inquiry into centrality.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. at 887 n. 4, 110 S.Ct. 1595; <i>see also Northwest Indian Cemetery,</i> 485 U.S. at 451, 108 S.Ct. 1319 (\"Whatever may be the exact line between unconstitutional prohibitions on the free exercise of religion and the legitimate conduct by government of its own affairs, the location of the line cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector's spiritual development.\"); <i>cf. Widmar,</i> 454 U.S. at 269 n. 6, 102 S.Ct. 269 (rejecting distinction between \"religious worship\" and other religious speech because it would require courts \"to inquire into the significance of words and practices to different religious faiths\" and \"[s]uch inquiries would tend inevitably to entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by our cases\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Borough asserts that the plaintiffs cannot state a free exercise claim because the <i>eruv</i> is an \"optional\" religious practice. For reasons similar to those counseling against requiring the plaintiffs to demonstrate a substantial burden on their religious practice, we cannot accept the Borough's contention that courts presented with free exercise claims should, as a threshold matter, determine whether the religious practices at issue are \"mandatory\" or \"optional.\" We need not consider whether the Borough's characterization of the <i>eruv</i> is accurate. Neither the Supreme Court nor our Court has intimated that only compulsory religious practices fall within the ambit of the Free Exercise Clause. To the contrary, our en banc decision in <i>DeHart</i> said that conduct implicates the Free Exercise Clause if it is motivated by \"beliefs which are both sincerely held and religious in nature\" without regard to whether it is mandatory. 227 F.3d at 51; <i>cf. id.</i> at 54-55 (rejecting contention that, in the context of prisoners' free exercise claims, conduct based on \"religious commandments\" should receive more protection than conduct that is \"a positive expression of belief\"); <i>see also Levitan v. Ashcroft,</i> 281 F.3d 1313, 1319 (D.C.Cir.2002) (holding that, because \"[a] requirement that a religious practice be mandatory to warrant First Amendment protection finds no warrant in the cases of the Supreme Court or of this court,\" Catholic prisoners could raise free exercise challenge to rule barring them from consuming small amounts of wine during Communion).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> Further, if the Borough's position were correct, the <i>Lukumi</i> Court would have considered whether Santeria adherents believe their faith commands them to sacrifice animals. But the Court did not do so, instead deeming it sufficient that they had a sincere desire to sacrifice animals for religious reasons. <i>See Lukumi,</i> 508 U.S. at 531, 113 S.Ct. 2217.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, if anything turned on whether a religious practice is \"mandatory\" or \"optional,\" courts would have to question \"the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of [their] creeds\" and perhaps even adjudicate \"controversies over religious authority or dogma,\" tasks that are \"not within the judicial ken.\" <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. at 877, 887, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>cf.

Application of strict scrutiny</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Borough's decision to remove the <i>eruv</i> is not neutral toward conduct motivated by Orthodox Jewish beliefs, it \"must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.\" <i>Lukumi,</i> 508 U.S. at 546, 113 S.Ct. 2217. To be permissible under the Free Exercise Clause, it \"must advance interests of the highest order and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Borough attempts to justify its decision to remove the <i>eruv,</i> and distinguish the <i>lechis</i> from the violations of Ordinance 691 it has tolerated, on the grounds that the <i>lechis</i> are \"permanent\" and religious in nature. Neither ground is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of our strict scrutiny analysis parallels our earlier discussion of why the Borough's decision is not religion-neutral. <i>See Lukumi,</i> 508 U.S. at 546-47, 113 S.Ct. 2217 (stating that lack of neutrality eviscerates contention that restriction is narrowly tailored to advance compelling interest). First, for many years &#8212; and, the record shows, after the plaintiffs sued &#8212; the Borough has allowed its residents to nail house numbers to utility poles. Because the Borough has tolerated equally permanent house numbers, it hardly has a compelling interest in refusing to allow the inconspicuous <i>lechis</i> on the ground that they are permanent. Further, it is hard to see how the allegedly permanent nature of the unobtrusive <i>lechis</i> somehow undermines Ordinance 691's objective of avoiding visual clutter and maintaining control over municipal property more than items like bright orange ribbons and lost animal signs. Moreover, even if the Borough had a compelling interest in preventing permanent fixtures on its utility poles, its decision to remove the <i>eruv</i> while allowing the house numbers is not narrowly tailored to promote that interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the Borough's claim that it can remove the <i>eruv</i> because of its religious nature requires more discussion, it is similarly unpersuasive. The Borough maintains that its decision to remove the <i>eruv</i> is justified by its \"compelling\" interest in avoiding \"an Establishment Clause controversy.\" Contrary to the Borough's position, however, a government interest in imposing greater separation of church and state than the federal Establishment Clause mandates is not compelling in the First Amendment context. <i>See Widmar,</i> 454 U.S. at 276, 102 S.Ct. 269 (rejecting state university's contention that its interest in complying with the state constitution's prohibition on religious establishments, which was more restrictive than its federal counterpart, justified discriminating against religious speech, and explaining that \"the state interest asserted here &#8212; in achieving greater separation of church and State than is already ensured under the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution &#8212; is limited by the Free Exercise Clause and in this case by the Free Speech Clause as well\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> <i>Davey,</i> 299 F.3d at 759 (same in context of free exercise claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Borough further argues, however, that leaving the <i>eruv</i> in place would constitute an actual Establishment Clause violation, and that the need to avoid such a violation justifies discriminating against the plaintiffs' religiously motivated conduct. Before explaining why this argument is also unavailing, we must examine the Supreme Court's recent pronouncements in the area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> Until the past decade, the Supreme Court generally applied the three-prong test of <i>Lemon v.

Thus the reasonable, informed observer would know that the <i>lechis</i> are items with religious significance and that they enable Orthodox Jews to engage in activities otherwise off limits on the Sabbath, but would also know that the Borough was allowing them to remain on the utility poles only because its selective application of Ordinance 691 renders removing the <i>lechis</i> a free exercise violation. <i>See Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 632, 109 S.Ct. 3086 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\"In cases involving the lifting of government burdens on the free exercise of religion, a reasonable observer would take into account the values underlying the Free Exercise Clause in assessing whether the challenged practice conveyed a message of endorsement.\"). Cognizant of the Borough's secular purpose of complying with the Free Exercise Clause, <i>see Mergens,</i> 496 U.S. at 249, 110 S.Ct. 2356, and the religion-neutral effect of treating the <i>lechis</i> like other postings, the reasonable observer would not believe that the Borough was promoting Orthodox Judaism. <i>See Gregoire v. Centennial Sch.

Similarly, because the <i>eruv</i> is maintained solely with private funds, and because allowing the <i>lechis</i> to remain in place would represent neutral rather than preferential treatment of religiously motivated conduct, no reasonable, informed observer would believe the Borough is \"affirmatively sponsor[ing]\" an Orthodox Jewish practice. <i>Santa Fe Indep.,</i> 530 U.S. at 313, 120 S.Ct. 2266.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that access to the utility poles on Borough land constitutes a \"benefit,\" \"the `guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended'\" when religious persons benefit incidentally from \"`neutral criteria and evenhanded policies.'\" <i>Good News Club,</i> 533 U.S. at 114, 121 S.Ct. 2093 (quoting <i>Rosenberger,</i> 515 U.S. at 839, 115 S.Ct. 2510).

Moreover, even if there is some slight risk that a reasonable, informed observer might \"misperceive the endorsement of religion,\" there is a much greater risk that the observer would perceive hostility toward Orthodox Jews if the Borough removes the <i>lechis.

Packed Fresh Produce, Inc.,</i> 222 F.3d 132, 140 (3d Cir.2000); <i>see also Council of Alternative Political Parties v. Hooks,</i> 121 F.3d 876, 883-84 (3d Cir.1997); <i>Polaroid Corp. v. Disney,</i> 862 F.2d 987, 1006 (3d Cir.1988). Our review of the record leaves us convinced that, in addition to the reasonable probability that the plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on their free exercise claim, the remaining three factors for injunctive relief &#8212; irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the public interest &#8212; also favor a preliminary injunction. Limitations on the free exercise of religion inflict irreparable injury. <i>Fifth Ave. Presbyterian Church v. City of New York,</i> 293 F.3d 570, 574 (2d Cir.2002); <i>Kikumura v. Hurley,</i> 242 F.3d 950, 963 (10th Cir.2001); <i>see also Swartzwelder v. McNeilly,</i> 297 F.3d 228, 241 (3d Cir.2002) (\"`The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'\") (quoting <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976)). The plaintiffs have demonstrated that, if the <i>eruv</i> is removed, they will be unable to push and carry objects outside the home on the Sabbath, and those who are disabled or have small children consequently will be unable to attend synagogue. This showing easily satisfies the irreparable injury requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the balance of hardships, a preliminary injunction would not harm the Borough more than denying relief would harm the plaintiffs. Enjoining removal of the <i>eruv</i> would cause neither the Borough nor its residents any serious injury. Without an injunction, on the other hand, the plaintiffs' free exercise of religion will be impaired.

Hooks,</i> 121 F.3d 876, 884 (3d Cir.1997). We do not see how removing the <i>lechis</i> could advance any interests sufficient to outweigh the infringement of the plaintiffs' free exercise rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, the District Court should have preliminarily enjoined the Borough from removing the <i>lechis</i> pending a trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the plaintiffs are not likely to prevail on their Fair Housing Act claim and do not present a viable free speech claim, they are reasonably likely to show that the Borough violated the Free Exercise Clause by applying Ordinance 691 selectively against conduct motivated by Orthodox Jewish beliefs. Because the three other factors for injunctive relief also favor the plaintiffs, we reverse the District Court's denial of injunctive relief and will enter an order directing the Court to issue a preliminary injunction barring the Borough from removing the <i>lechis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See</i> Borough of Tenafly, <i>About Tenafly,</i> at http://www.tenaflynj.org/about.htm (last visited September 20, 2002).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Our description of the facts is based on our independent review of the record because, as explained in more detail below, the First Amendment bars us from deferring to the District Court's factual findings unless they involve witness credibility<i>See Hurley v.

The Borough has not suggested, either to the District Court or to our Court, that its decision to remove the<i>lechis</i> was based on that ordinance. Instead, it has maintained throughout this litigation that its decision was based only on Ordinance 691. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 155 F.Supp.2d at 159-60.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1343</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> We can dispense quickly with the plaintiffs' contention that they have a valid FHA claim. One necessary element of a cause of action under the FHA is that the plaintiffs must be \"aggrieved person[s],\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3613(a)(1)(A), which in this context means victims of \"a discriminatory housing practice,\"<i>Id.</i> &#167; 3602, that \"make[s] unavailable or den[ies]\" housing to them based on their religion. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3604(a). Some of the plaintiffs lived in the Borough before the <i>eruv</i> was established. 155 F.Supp.2d at 188. Therefore, while the plaintiffs claim that the Borough wants to remove the <i>eruv</i> to discourage Orthodox Jews from moving into town, they do not claim that removing the <i>eruv</i> would make housing within the Borough \"unavailable\" to them. Instead, they argue that removing the <i>eruv</i> would make their living in the Borough much less desirable. But they concede that the Borough's decision did not directly affect anyone's current or future home. To our knowledge, no court has stretched the \"make unavailable or deny\" language of &#167; 3604(a) to encompass actions that both (1) do not actually make it more <i>difficult</i> (as opposed to less <i>desirable</i>) to obtain housing and (2) do not directly regulate or zone housing or activities within the home. <i>See, e.g., LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher,</i> 67 F.3d 412, 424 (2d Cir.1995) (stating that the pertinent language \"has been interpreted to reach a wide variety of discriminatory housing practices, including discriminatory zoning restrictions\"); <i>South-Suburban Hous. Ctr. v. Greater S. Suburban Bd. of Realtors,</i> 935 F.2d 868, 882 (7th Cir.1991) (stating that the relevant language of &#167; 3604(a) applies to \"actions by individuals or governmental units which directly affect the availability of housing\") (internal quotation marks omitted). We believe that expanding &#167; 3604(a) as the plaintiffs suggest is unwarranted, as it would \"create an FHA claim in every circumstance where a religious group is denied a request to use municipal property to make an area more appealing for the private practice of their religion,\" even if the municipal action has nothing to do with housing. 155 F.Supp.2d at 189.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We note, however, that we do not agree with the Borough's contention &#8212; and the District Court's acquiescence, if its use of the word \"standing\" was meant to signify a perceived lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' FHA claim &#8212; that the issue is jurisdictional. When the presence or absence of a cause of action depends on how statutory language is interpreted (as the plaintiffs' FHA claim does), the absence of a valid statutory cause of action does not preclude jurisdiction unless the claim is frivolous or a transparent attempt to manufacture federal-court jurisdiction where none existed. <i>See Verizon Md., Inc. v.

The opinions cited in support of this proposition were <i>Cooper v.

Instead, we believe, especially in light of subsequent doctrinal developments, that the dictum in <i>United States v. Board of Education</i> may be inconsistent with Widmar's principle that an interest in more separation between church and state than the Establishment Clause requires cannot justify restricting rights shielded by the Free Exercise Clause. <i>See Widmar,</i> 454 U.S. at 276, 102 S.Ct. 269.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">First, summary dispositions by the Supreme Court \"cannot be taken as adopting the reasoning of the lower court,\" <i>Wis.

Stern et al., <i>Supreme Court Practice</i> &#167; 4.29, at 284 (8th ed.2002). Hence the Supreme Court's summary disposition in <i>Cooper</i> cannot be interpreted as endorsing the Oregon Supreme Court's reasoning, particularly since that reasoning flatly contradicts Widmar. <i>See Fusari v. Steinberg,</i> 419 U.S. 379, 388-89 n. 15, 95 S.Ct. 533, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975) (stating that, even though a lower court's interpretation of a summary affirmance by the Supreme Court was \"plausible,\" it was improper because it would \"leave little vitality\" to an earlier Supreme Court decision); <i>see also id.</i> at 391-92, 95 S.Ct. 533 (Burger, C.J., concurring) (\"An unexplicated summary affirmance settles the issues for the parties, and is not to be read as a renunciation by this Court of doctrines previously announced in our opinions after full argument.\").</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Cooper,</i> moreover, the Supreme Court has held in several cases that a government interest in appearing neutral toward religion, where not necessary to comply with the Establishment Clause, cannot justify limiting First Amendment rights. <i>See Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch.,</i> 533 U.S. 98, 112-19, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001); <i>Rosenberger,</i> 515 U.S. at 839-46, 115 S.Ct. 2510; <i>Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Bd. v.

Because subsequent doctrinal developments remove whatever precedential authority a summary disposition inconsistent with them might have, <i>see Hicks v.

No. 4,</i> 637 F.2d 898, 902 (3d Cir.1980), we believe that in all likelihood the Supreme Court summarily dismissed the appeal in <i>Cooper</i> under the principle of <i>Pickering v.

Four Justices, however, recognized that the endorsement test controls when government discriminates in favor of religion, but argued that there is no need to apply the test to \"purely private\" religious expression that occurs in a public forum \"open to all on equal terms\" because such expression can never violate the Establishment Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 770, 115 S.Ct. 2440 (opinion of Scalia, J.).

Because there is no evidence that the acts in question are expressive, we hold that the Free Speech Clause does not apply. We further hold, however, that the Borough's selective enforcement of its ordinance likely violated the Free Exercise Clause. Because the other requirements for injunctive relief are satisfied, we reverse and direct the District Court to issue a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ordinance in the Borough of Tenafly, which encompasses 4.4 square miles and has a population of 13,806,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> provides in pertinent part: \"No person shall place any sign or advertisement, or other matter upon any pole, tree, curbstone, sidewalk or elsewhere, in any public street or public place, excepting such as may be authorized by this or any other ordinance of the Borough.\" Tenafly, N.J., Ordinance 691 Article VIII(7) (1954).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Although Ordinance 691 does not allow Borough officials to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis, in practice they have often done so. House number signs nailed to utility poles in plain view are frequently left in place. Local churches are tacitly allowed to post permanent directional signs bearing crosses on municipal property. Lost animal signs and other private postings often remain undisturbed by Borough officials. Orange ribbons were affixed to utility poles \"for a lengthy period of time\" by supporters of the local high school during a protracted controversy over school regionalization, but Borough officials made no effort to remove them. Every year, officials in the small community permit the local Chamber of Commerce to affix holiday displays to the Borough's utility poles for approximately six weeks during the Christmas holiday season. Red ribbons, wreaths, and seasonal holiday lights are attached to the Borough's utility poles as part of these displays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in this case are Orthodox Jewish residents of Tenafly<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> whose faith forbids them from pushing or carrying objects outside their homes on the Sabbath or Yom Kippur.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In accordance with a religious convention practiced by Orthodox Jews for over two thousand years, however, the plaintiffs believe they may engage in such activities outside their homes on the Sabbath within an <i>eruv,</i> a ceremonial demarcation of an area. <i>Tenafly Eruv Ass'n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2366382\"><a href=\"/opinion/2366382/tenafly-eruv-assn-inc-v-borough-of-tenafly/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span>, 146 (D.N.J.2001). An <i>eruv</i> extends the space within which pushing and carrying is permitted on the Sabbath beyond the boundaries of the home, thereby enabling, for example, the plaintiffs to push baby strollers and wheelchairs, and carry canes and walkers, when traveling between home and synagogue. Without an <i>eruv</i> Orthodox Jews who have small children or are disabled typically cannot attend synagogue on the Sabbath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Centuries ago, an <i>eruv</i> would be built using ropes and wooden poles. Today, Orthodox Jews can construct an <i>eruv</i> by attaching <i>lechis</i> &#8212; thin black strips made of the same hard plastic material as, and nearly identical to, the coverings on ordinary ground wires &#8212; vertically along utility poles. Along with preexisting horizontal overhead utility lines, the <i>lechis</i> designate an <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Unless one knows which black plastic strips are <i>lechis</i> and which are utility wires, it is \"absolutely impossible\" to distinguish the two. <i>Id.</i> at 149. Throughout this litigation, the plaintiffs have maintained that an <i>eruv</i> (as well as each constituent lechi) is \"not a religious symbol,\" but rather is an item with \"religious significance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 148.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 1, 1999, Erez Gotlieb and Gary Osen, two Orthodox Jews who are not parties to this case, met with Tenafly Mayor Ann Moscovitz to discuss creating an <i>eruv</i> in the Borough. Gotlieb and Osen met with Moscovitz because under Orthodox Jewish law an <i>eruv</i> is not valid unless a civil official with jurisdiction over the circumscribed area issues a ceremonial proclamation \"renting\" the area for a nominal fee (<i>e.g.,</i> one dollar). The Mayor said she lacked authority to issue the requested proclamation, but agreed to bring the matter to the attention of the Borough Council, the Borough's legislative branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> She did not mention Ordinance 691 or suggest that affixing <i>lechis</i> to utility poles might violate any other ordinance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the next Council meeting, on July 8, 1999, the Council and approximately thirty Tenafly residents debated whether the Borough should grant the proclamation. Many of those present expressed vehement objections prompted by their fear that an <i>eruv</i> would encourage Orthodox Jews to move to Tenafly. A Council member whom the District Court was unable to identify noted \"a concern that the Orthodoxy would take over\" Tenafly. <i>Id.</i> at 151-52. One Council member voiced his \"serious concern\" that \"Ultra-Orthodox\" Jews might \"stone[] cars that drive down the streets on the Sabbath.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153-54. The Borough Attorney participated in the debate. Neither he nor anyone else mentioned Ordinance 691 or indicated that attaching <i>lechis</i> to utility poles might be unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council decided to demand a formal, written proposal before voting on whether to issue the proclamation. Mayor Moscovitz advised Gotlieb and Osen, who did not attend the meeting, that the Council was unlikely to grant their request for a proclamation, but invited them to submit a formal application. Frustrated by the Borough's reticence, in August 1999 TEAI asked Bergen County Executive William P. Schuber, whose jurisdiction includes Tenafly, to issue the ceremonial proclamation necessary to validate the <i>eruv.</i> On December 15, 1999, he did so. The constitutionality of this action is not challenged in this case, and neither Schuber nor any other Bergen County official is a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon, the local telephone company, owns the utility poles in Tenafly, though the poles are located on the Borough's property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In April 2000, the plaintiffs asked Verizon for permission to attach <i>lechis</i> to its utility poles. The plaintiffs said in a sworn statement, which the District Court found \"credible,\" that they did not believe any municipal ordinance prohibited them from doing so, and thus that they did not need the Council's permission. <i>Id.</i> at 155. After the plaintiffs informed Verizon about the proclamation, they say, the company's in-house counsel researched whether municipal approval was required and advised the plaintiffs that it was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2000 Cablevision, holder of the local cable television franchise, volunteered to help the plaintiffs affix <i>lechis</i> to Verizon's utility poles as a community service. With the help of Cablevision personnel and equipment, an <i>eruv</i> was completed in Tenafly sometime in September 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The plaintiffs represent, and the Borough does not disagree, that only private funds have supported the <i>eruv</i> and that no municipal assistance of any kind will be needed to maintain it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borough officials apparently did not learn that an <i>eruv</i> was being erected in Tenafly until late August 2000. Mayor Moscovitz and Councilman Charles Lipson met with two local Jewish leaders on September 14, 2000, to discuss the matter. One of the Jewish leaders perceived some of the Mayor's remarks as derogatory toward Orthodox Jews, and the meeting was unproductive. Twelve days later, Borough Administrator Joseph DiGiacomo, acting at the Mayor's behest, asked Cablevision why it helped attach the <i>lechis</i> without the Borough's permission. According to DiGiacomo, the company told him that \"a Rabbi\" had advised it that TEAI had the necessary government approval. <i>Id.</i> at 158. On October 10, 2000, Mayor Moscovitz and the Council directed the Borough Administrator to ask Cablevision to remove the <i>lechis</i> from the utility poles \"as soon as possible.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 23, 2000, Cablevision wrote to the plaintiffs and informed them that the Borough instructed it to take down the <i>lechis.</i> Cablevision said it would begin complying with the Borough's order within three days unless the plaintiffs demonstrated they had municipal approval. Counsel for the plaintiffs subsequently negotiated from the Borough a thirty-day reprieve to give TEAI an opportunity to apply for permission from the Council to maintain the <i>eruv.</i> The letter setting out this agreement, sent by the plaintiffs' counsel to Borough Attorney Walter Lesnevich, states in part: \"I also appreciate your advice that the Borough has no specific ordinance covering this matter or any particular format for the <i>Eruv</i> Association to follow in submitting its request.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159. By the beginning of November 2000, neither Lesnevich nor any other Borough official had raised the possibility that Ordinance 691 or another ordinance might be relevant to the dispute over the <i>lechis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2000, the plaintiffs filed their application with the Borough, asking the Council not to remove or order the removal of the <i>lechis.</i> On November 21, 2000, the Council decided to hold two hearings to allow members of the public to comment on the plaintiffs' proposal. The Council scheduled the first hearing for November 28, 2000, and the second for December 12, 2000. Fifty-four members of the public, including plaintiff Chaim Book and other <i>eruv</i> proponents, spoke at the two hearings. The speakers were evenly divided between supporters and opponents of the <i>eruv.</i> During the hearings, Council members did not express their views until the conclusion of the December 12 hearing. At that hearing, just before the Council voted on the plaintiffs' application, one Councilman stated that \"[t]o the best of my knowledge,\" the Borough had \"no ordinance, no resolution that says that you cannot hang something from a utility pole.\" Mayor Moscovitz responded by saying \"[t]here is an ordinance,\" and Lesnevich then described Ordinance 691. This exchange was apparently the first time that Borough officials mentioned Ordinance 691 with regard to the <i>lechis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Lesnevich brought Ordinance 691 to the Council members' attention, the Council voted 5-0 to force the plaintiffs to remove the <i>lechis.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The next day, the Borough ordered Cablevision to take the <i>lechis</i> off the utility poles \"as soon as possible.\" 155 F.Supp.2d at 163. The plaintiffs responded by suing in the District Court on December 15, 2000, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983 and 1985, and the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3604(a), and seeking an injunction barring the Borough from interfering with the <i>eruv.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the District Court issued a temporary restraining order precluding the Borough from disturbing the <i>eruv.</i> Consent orders extended the duration of the restraint until the Court ruled on the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. After the parties completed limited discovery, the Court held an evidentiary hearing that spanned four days, received additional affidavits, and heard oral arguments. On August 10, 2001, the Court issued an opinion denying the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief on the ground that they are not reasonably likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's discussion began with the plaintiffs' claim that the Borough violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. The Court concluded (albeit without citing our decision in <i>Troster v. Pennsylvania State Department of Corrections,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703991\"><a href=\"/opinion/703991/dieter-hm-troster-v-pennsylvania-state-department-of-corrections-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1995)) that the act of affixing <i>lechis</i> to utility poles is \"symbolic speech.\" 155 F.Supp.2d at 173. Next the Court determined that the Borough's utility poles are a nonpublic forum, and that the Borough did not discriminate against the plaintiffs' religious viewpoint when it ordered the <i>lechis</i> removed. <i>Id.</i> at 174-80. The Court acknowledged that the Borough had expressly or tacitly permitted various facial violations of Ordinance 691,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> such as the holiday displays and church directional signs. But it distinguished the <i>lechis,</i> reasoning that the other materials affixed to the utility poles served commercial or functional purposes, were not religious in nature, and were not intended to be attached permanently. <i>Id.</i> at 176-78. Other items frequently affixed to utility poles in violation of Ordinance 691, such as the lost animal signs and permanently attached house numbers, did not show discriminatory enforcement because the Borough said it made efforts to remove some of them after the plaintiffs sued. <i>Id.</i> at 177-78. As for the orange ribbons, the Court stated that, notwithstanding Mayor Moscovitz's testimony and other evidence in the record, it \"lack[ed] sufficient information\" to find that the Borough knew about and tacitly approved them. <i>Id.</i> at 177. The Court concluded that the Borough's application of the ordinance did not discriminate against the plaintiffs' religious viewpoint, and thus their free speech claim could not succeed. <i>Id.</i> at 180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the Borough violated the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 180-86. The Court disagreed with the plaintiffs' position that the objective effect of the Borough's decision was to discriminate against religiously motivated activity. It noted that, under <i>Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112037\"><a href=\"/opinion/112037/lyng-v-northwest-indian-cemetery-protective-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112037\"><a href=\"/opinion/112037/lyng-v-northwest-indian-cemetery-protective-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span> (1988), the Borough can deny access to utility poles on its land for a religion-neutral reason even if doing so imposes an \"incidental\" burden on Orthodox Jews' ability to practice their religion. 155 F.Supp.2d at 180-81. The Court reasoned that because the Borough ordered the <i>lechis</i> taken down pursuant to Ordinance 691, \"a pre-existing, neutral law of general applicability,\" the issue was controlled by the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Employment Division v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span> (1993). 155 F.Supp.2d at 181. The Court did not consider whether its earlier conclusion that Borough officials chose not to enforce Ordinance 691 with respect to some secularly motivated commercial and functional postings, <i>see id.</i> at 177-80, affected the free exercise analysis. Under Smith, the District Court reasoned, the Borough Council's decision to enforce Ordinance 691 against the <i>eruv</i> had an objectively neutral effect that did not implicate the Free Exercise Clause. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court thought, however, that the Council members' improper subjective motivations nonetheless necessitated strict scrutiny under <i>Lukumi.

Camden Citizens,</i> 274 F.3d at 777; <i>Adams v.

If these two threshold showings are made the District Court then considers, to the extent relevant, (3) whether an injunction would harm the Borough more than denying relief would harm the plaintiffs and (4) whether granting relief would serve the public interest. <i>See S. Camden Citizens,</i> 274 F.3d at 777; <i>Freedom Forge,</i> 204 F.3d at 484. Because the District Court ended its analysis after concluding that the plaintiffs did not show that their claims are reasonably likely to succeed, <i>see</i> 155 F.Supp.2d at 171, 191, our discussion focuses on that factor.

Affixing <i>lechis</i> to utility poles does not involve the use of words, so the plaintiffs' behavior is protected by the Free Speech Clause only if it constitutes expressive conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conduct is protected by the First Amendment when \"the nature of [the] activity, combined with the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken,\" shows that the \"activity was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the [First Amendment's] scope.\" <i>Spence v.

Applying this two-prong test (the \"<i>Spence-Johnson</i> test\"), the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment shelters certain forms of nonverbal communication. For instance, <i>Johnson</i> held that burning an American flag as part of a demonstration against the Reagan Administration's policies that coincided with the 1984 Republican Party convention was \"speech\" because its \"expressive, overtly political nature\" was \"both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent\" to the protestors' audience. 491 U.S. at 399, 406, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112304\"><a href=\"/opinion/112304/texas-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2533</span></a></span>. Similarly, <i>Spence</i> held that attaching a peace symbol to an American flag and displaying the \"peace flag\" upside down was protected expression. The actor \"testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and displayed it to public view as a protest against the invasion of Cambodia and the killings at Kent State University, events which occurred a few days prior to his arrest,\" and \"it would have been difficult for the great majority of citizens to miss the drift of appellant's point at the time that he made it.\" 418 U.S. at 408, 410, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109092\"><a href=\"/opinion/109092/spence-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because <i>Spence</i> \"contained no language of necessity,\" we adopted the following standard: conduct is expressive if, \"considering `the nature of[the] activity, combined with the factual context and environment in which it was undertaken,' we are led to the conclusion that the `activity was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1090 (quoting <i>Spence,</i> 418 U.S. at 409-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109092\"><a href=\"/opinion/109092/spence-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We emphasized that this \"is a fact-sensitive, context-dependent inquiry,\" and that the putative speaker bears the burden of proving that his or her conduct is expressive. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then applied this formulation to reject a state corrections officer's claim that a regulation mandating that each corrections officer wear an American flag patch on his uniform's right shirt-sleeve, with the star field facing his rear, violated the First Amendment by compelling him to engage in expressive conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 1088. The officer believed that compulsory display debases the flag and that \"displaying the flag with its star field to the rear signifies cowardice and retreat from the principles for which the flag stands.\" <i>Id.</i> Though we recognized the strength of the officer's convictions, we determined that he did not show that the act of wearing a flag patch was sufficiently communicative to receive First Amendment protection, as he did not present \"evidence to support his otherwise bare assertion that the flag patch regulation compels expressive conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1091 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our discussion in <i>Troster</i> focused on two inquiries. First, we examined whether the officer intended subjectively (<i>i.e.,</i> actually intended) for his conduct to communicate to persons whom he expected to observe it (<i>i.e.,</i> his intended audience). We determined that there was no proof that his conduct was \"demonstrative of an attitude or belief\" or that he \"actually assert[ed] anything to anyone.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1091-92. Second, we considered whether observers understood the message the officer intended his conduct to convey. The record contained no evidence that \"observers would likely understand the patch or the wearer to be <i>telling</i> them anything about the wearers' beliefs\" or \"that the flag patch on the correctional officers' uniform will relay any <i>message</i> (ideological or otherwise) to anyone.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1091-92 (emphases in original). Therefore, the officer's compelled speech claim failed because he did not show that the conduct in which he was forced to engage was expressive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our emphasis in <i>Troster</i> on the putative speaker's burden of proving that his conduct is \"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication\" is important to our resolution of the plaintiffs' expressive conduct claim in this case. If the putative speaker's burden were \"limited to `the advancement of a plausible contention' that [his or her] conduct is expressive\" &#8212; a view espoused by a plurality of the D.C. Circuit but rejected by the Supreme Court in <i>Clark</i> &#8212; the result \"would be to create a rule that all conduct is presumptively expressive.\" <i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111245\"><a href=\"/opinion/111245/clark-v-community-for-creative-non-violence/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Such a rule would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court's repeated admonition that \"[w]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled `speech.'\" <i>O'Brien,</i> 391 U.S. at 376, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore, as we stressed in <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1091-92, and as the Supreme Court held in <i>Clark,</i> \"it is the obligation of the person desiring to engage in assertedly expressive conduct to demonstrate that the First Amendment even applies.\" <i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111245\"><a href=\"/opinion/111245/clark-v-community-for-creative-non-violence/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The record indicates that the <i>lechis</i> were attached for the benefit of other Orthodox Jews, not the general public. Therefore, if the plaintiffs' conduct is expressive, their intended audience is other Orthodox Jews. But the plaintiffs have not introduced evidence that the <i>lechis</i> are meant to demonstrate a belief or assert anything to Orthodox Jews or that Orthodox Jews \"likely understand\" the <i>eruv</i> \"to be telling them anything,\" <i>i.e.,</i> that they discern \"any message (ideological or otherwise)\" from the <i>lechis.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1091 (emphases in original). Instead, on the record before us, it appears that the <i>eruv</i> serves a purely functional, non-communicative purpose indistinguishable, for free speech purposes, from that of a fence surrounding a yard or a wall surrounding a building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than \"actually assert[ing] anything to anyone,\" <i>id.</i> at 1092, it seems that the <i>eruv</i> simply demarcates the space within which certain activities otherwise forbidden on the Sabbath are allowed. Plaintiff Chaim Book described the <i>eruv</i> as a \"boundary\" that \"requires physical demarcation,\" a function historically achieved by \"rop[ing] an area off.\" Similarly, at oral argument counsel for the plaintiffs told us that the <i>lechis</i> \"replace[] the pole[s] that would be used prior to the time there were telephone poles\" to designate the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries. While the plaintiffs describe the <i>eruv</i> in functional terms, explaining that it establishes an area within which Orthodox Jews may engage in certain otherwise impermissible activities, they offer no evidence that it communicates anything. The only evidence the plaintiffs introduced with respect to the religious significance of the <i>eruv</i> was the affidavit of Rabbi Hershel Schachter of Yeshiva University, an expert on Orthodox Jewish law. Rabbi Schachter explained that the <i>eruv</i> enables couples with young children and persons who use wheelchairs to attend synagogue on the Sabbath. He did not, however, suggest that the Orthodox Jews who affix <i>lechis</i> intend to send any message thereby, or that the <i>eruv</i> conveys any message to Orthodox Jews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, there is no evidence that Orthodox Jews receive a message or ascertain the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries by looking at the <i>lechis.</i> To the contrary, Rabbi Howard Jachter, speaking on behalf of the TEAI, said that \"most Orthodox Jews do not ... would not know how to make an <i>eruv,</i> wouldn't see where the <i>eruv</i> is, how it is. A rabbi wouldn't know how it is.\" Even plaintiff Chaim Book, who is obviously familiar with the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries and the <i>lechis</i>' locations, said, \"I, who know some of the poles have <i>lechis,</i> have a hard time recognizing the lechi on the pole by just looking at it.\" In addition, plaintiffs' complaint states that \"the <i>eruv</i> is not a religious symbol.\" Thus there is no evidence contradicting the Borough's assertion at oral argument &#8212; which the plaintiffs did not dispute &#8212; that Orthodox Jews learn the <i>eruv</i>'s boundaries by word of mouth from the persons charged with erecting and inspecting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the plaintiffs had introduced evidence that the <i>lechis</i> serve a boundary function, that would be insufficient to prove they are \"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\" <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1090 (internal quotation marks omitted). All boundary lines delineate the realms within which certain activities are or are not allowed. For instance, the invisible boundary between Nevada and Utah separates an area where gambling is legal from one where it is not. A homeowner's fence demarcates where his neighbor's garden must stop. The walls of a synagogue delineate the space where congregational worship takes place. But geographical boundary lines, fences, and walls are simply not protected expression in the absence of evidence that some \"attitude or belief,\" <i>Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1091, is conveyed or received from them. <i>Cf.

To the extent that the plaintiffs' point is that functionality and expression are \"not mutually exclusive,\" we do not disagree; things ordinarily used for functional purposes can be used for communicative purposes as well. <i>Name.

But there is no evidence that the <i>eruv</i> is an example of such overlapping purposes, whereas there was ample evidence to that effect in <i>Allegheny.</i> As part of a holiday display that stood at the entrance to a government building and included a 45-foot Christmas tree, the 18-foot menorah was both intended and understood to express \"a recognition that Christmas is not the only traditional way of observing the winter-holiday season\" and \"an acknowledgment of Chanukah as a contemporaneous alternative tradition.\" <i>Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 617-18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112331\"><a href=\"/opinion/112331/allegheny-county-v-greater-pittsburgh-aclu/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To accept this position would mean that whether conduct is expressive depends entirely on how observers <i>perceive</i> it &#8212; even if the actor had no communicative intent, and even if the actor disapproves of the message (or messages) discerned by the observers. <i>See Troster,</i> 65 F.3d at 1092 (noting the difference between an observer's independent inference from an actor's behavior and an observer's receipt of a nonverbal message intentionally sent by the actor); Peter Meijes Tiersma, <i>Nonverbal Communication and the Freedom of \"Speech\",</i> 1993 Wis.

We believe that expanding &#167; 3604(a) as the plaintiffs suggest is unwarranted, as it would \"create an FHA claim in every circumstance where a religious group is denied a request to use municipal property to make an area more appealing for the private practice of their religion,\" even if the municipal action has nothing to do with housing. 155 F.Supp.2d at 189.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We note, however, that we do not agree with the Borough's contention &#8212; and the District Court's acquiescence, if its use of the word \"standing\" was meant to signify a perceived lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' FHA claim &#8212; that the issue is jurisdictional. When the presence or absence of a cause of action depends on how statutory language is interpreted (as the plaintiffs' FHA claim does), the absence of a valid statutory cause of action does not preclude jurisdiction unless the claim is frivolous or a transparent attempt to manufacture federal-court jurisdiction where none existed. <i>See Verizon Md., Inc. v.
