Friedman, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, sitting\nby designation.\n\f              Case: 13-10566    Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 2 of 34\n\n\n      This appeal requires us to decide whether the sovereign immunity of Florida,\n\nas confirmed by the Eleventh Amendment, U.S. Const. Amend. XI, bars a federal\n\ncomplaint by an Indian tribe against the Florida Department of Revenue and its\n\nExecutive Director for a declaratory judgment that the tribe is exempt from paying\n\na Florida tax on fuel and for an injunction requiring a refund of taxes paid. The\n\nSeminole Tribe of Florida contends that a Florida tax on motor and diesel fuel\n\npurchased off tribal lands violates the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I,\n\n§ 8, cl. 3, the Indian sovereignty doctrine, and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S.\n\nConst. Amend. XIV, § 1. After a state court rejected a complaint by the Tribe\n\nabout fuel taxes paid between 2004 and 2006, the Tribe filed a federal complaint\n\nabout taxes paid between 2009 and 2012. The district court dismissed the federal\n\ncomplaint based on a judicial doctrine that bars federal district courts from\n\nreviewing state court judgments, Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 44 S.\n\nCt. 149 (1923); D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 103 S. Ct. 1303\n\n(1983), and, alternatively, based on the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341. But\n\nwe need not decide the correctness of those rulings because we conclude that the\n\nDepartment and its Director enjoy sovereign immunity from this suit. We\n\nAFFIRM the dismissal of the complaint filed by the Tribe.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f              Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 3 of 34\n\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n      The Seminole Tribe of Florida is a federally recognized Indian tribe. See\n\nIndian Entities Recognized & Eligible to Receive Services from the United States\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs, 78 Fed. Reg. 26,384, 26,387 (May 6, 2013); Indian\n\nReorganization Act of June 18, 1934, § 16, ch. 576, 48 Stat. 984, 987 (codified as\n\namended at 25 U.S.C. § 476). Like any other entity in Florida, the Tribe pays a\n\nstate tax on the purchase of fuel. See Fla. Stat. § 206.01 et seq. The State, counties,\n\nand municipalities use revenues from that tax to construct and repair transportation\n\nfacilities, roads, bridges, and paths. See, e.g., Fla. Const. Art. 12, § 9(c)(5); Fla.\n\nStat. §§ 206.60(1)(b)(1), 206.605(1), (2). For administrative convenience, the State\n\nprecollects the tax from suppliers of fuel before the suppliers sell the fuel to\n\nconsumers. See Fla. Stat. § 206.41(4)(a), (6). The cost of the tax is then passed on\n\nto the consumer of the fuel when the consumer purchases fuel at a retail gas\n\nstation. Even though the Department precollects the tax from a supplier before the\n\nfuel is sold to the ultimate consumer, Florida law provides that the “legal incidence\n\nof the tax” is “on the ultimate consumer.” Id. § 206.41(4)(a).\n\n      Florida law exempts some consumers, but not the Tribe, from the fuel tax. If\n\na consumer is exempt from the tax, then the consumer may obtain a refund from\n\nthe Department for the amount of fuel taxes the consumer has paid. Id.\n\n§ 206.41(4), (5). For example, the Department refunds any fuel taxes paid by a\n\n\n                                            3\n\f              Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 4 of 34\n\n\nmunicipality for fuel used in a municipal vehicle, and the municipality uses that\n\nrefund for the construction and maintenance of roadways within its borders. Id.\n\n§ 206.41(4)(d). Likewise, any consumer who uses fuel for agricultural,\n\naquacultural, commercial fishing, or commercial aviation purposes is exempt from\n\nthe tax and eligible for a refund from the Department. Id. § 206.41(4)(c).\n\n      Florida law does not exempt the Tribe from the fuel tax, and the Department\n\nhas refused to refund taxes the Tribe paid when it purchased fuel at gas stations\n\nlocated off tribal lands. The Tribe argues that, because it maintains its own\n\nroadways, it is entitled to a refund for taxes paid for fuel expended on tribal lands\n\nby vehicles carrying out essential government services, regardless of where the\n\nTribe purchased the fuel. The Department argues that the Tribe does not actually\n\nuse the fuel on tribal lands because Florida law defines the “use” of fuel as\n\noccurring when consumers fill the fuel tanks in their vehicles. Id. § 206.01(24)\n\n(defining “use” as “the placing of motor or diesel fuel into any receptacle on a\n\nmotor vehicle from which fuel is supplied for the propulsion thereof”).\n\n      The Tribe has twice sued the Department about whether the Tribe is exempt\n\nfrom the fuel tax. The Tribe filed the first suit in a state court and the second in a\n\nfederal court. Both times the Tribe lost.\n\n      The Tribe first sued the Department in a Florida court for a refund of fuel\n\ntaxes paid between January 1, 2004, and February 28, 2006. The Tribe also sought\n\n                                            4\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014   Page: 5 of 34\n\n\na declaratory judgment that the fuel expended on tribal lands was exempt from the\n\ntax. A Florida court of appeals held that the tax did not violate the Indian\n\nCommerce Clause because the State levied the tax at gas stations located off tribal\n\nlands. Fla. Dep’t of Revenue v. Seminole Tribe of Fla., 65 So. 3d 1094, 1097 (Fla.\n\n4th Dist. Ct. App. 2011), review denied, 86 So. 3d 1114 (Fla. 2012).\n\n      The Tribe then filed a federal complaint that contested liability for\n\n$393,247.30 in fuel taxes paid by the Tribe between June 7, 2009, and March 31,\n\n2012. The Tribe sought both declaratory judgments and an injunction in the\n\nfollowing six counts of its complaint: first, a declaratory judgment that the Tribe is\n\nexempt from the fuel tax because the tax, levied on fuel expended on tribal lands,\n\nviolates the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3; second, a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the Tribe is exempt from the fuel tax because the tax,\n\nlevied on fuel used to provide essential government services, violates the Indian\n\nCommerce Clause and the Indian sovereignty doctrine; third, a declaratory\n\njudgment that the Tribe is entitled to a refund under the Equal Protection Clause,\n\nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1, because Florida exempts fuel used in vehicles\n\noperated by municipal or county governments from the tax, but not fuel used in\n\nvehicles operated by the Tribe that perform essential government services; fourth,\n\na declaratory judgment that the Tribe is entitled to a refund under the Equal\n\nProtection Clause because Florida exempts other groups that do not use state\n\n                                          5\n\f              Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 6 of 34\n\n\nroadways, but does not exempt the Tribe even though it uses fuel on its roadways\n\non tribal lands; fifth, a declaratory judgment that the Tribe is entitled to a refund\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause because Florida uses the tax revenues for the\n\nconstruction and maintenance of roadways, and the Tribe constructs and maintains\n\nits own roadways on its tribal lands; sixth, an injunction barring the Department\n\nfrom refusing to refund the taxes paid for fuel that the Tribe used on its land to\n\nperform essential government services.\n\n      The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction. The district court ruled that the decisions in Rooker v. Fidelity Trust\n\nCo., 263 U.S. 413, 44 S. Ct. 149 (1923), and District of Columbia Court of Appeals\n\nv. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 103 S. Ct. 1303 (1983), barred the Tribe from\n\nrelitigating its earlier complaint filed in Florida court. The district court also ruled,\n\nin the alternative, that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, barred the\n\ncomplaint. The district court did not address whether sovereign immunity or res\n\njudicata barred the complaint even though the Department and its Director raised\n\nthose defenses too.\n\n                           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      We review the dismissal of a complaint de novo. Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nMcKinnon Motors, LLC, 329 F.3d 805, 807 (11th Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f              Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 7 of 34\n\n\n                                  III. DISCUSSION\n\n      The Tribe challenges both grounds upon which the district court dismissed\n\nits complaint, but we need not decide those issues if we affirm the dismissal on the\n\nalternative ground that sovereign immunity bars the complaint. The Tribe argues\n\nthat its federal complaint did not seek to overturn a previous state court judgment\n\nbecause the previous state judgment involved taxes paid between 2004 and 2006\n\nand the later federal complaint challenged taxes paid between 2009 and 2012. Cf.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 293, 125 S. Ct.\n\n1517, 1527 (2005) (“If a federal plaintiff presents some independent claim, albeit\n\none that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached[,] . . . then there is\n\njurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under\n\nprinciples of preclusion.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Tribe also\n\nargues that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, did not bar its complaint\n\nbecause another federal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1362, as interpreted in Moe v.\n\nConfederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes of the Flatheads Reservation, allows the\n\nTribe to challenge the state tax. 425 U.S. 463, 473–75, 96 S. Ct. 1634, 1641–42\n\n(1976) (“Here the United States could have made the same attack on the State’s\n\nassertion of taxing power as was in fact made by the Tribe.”). But we may affirm\n\nthe dismissal of a complaint on any ground supported by the record even if that\n\nground was not considered by the district court, Powers v. United States, 996 F.2d\n\n\n                                            7\n\f              Case: 13-10566    Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 8 of 34\n\n\n1121, 1123–24 (11th Cir. 1993), and state sovereign immunity is a threshold issue\n\nthat we must decide before requiring a state department and its officers to answer a\n\ncomplaint against them. See Bouchard Transp. Co. v. Fla. Dep’t of Envtl. Prot., 91\n\nF.3d 1445, 1448–49 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\n      Although the Eleventh Amendment “is neither a source of nor a limitation\n\non states’ sovereign immunity from suit,” the Amendment recognizes that states\n\nordinarily enjoy sovereign immunity from suits in federal court. Stroud v.\n\nMcIntosh, 722 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir. 2013). By its terms, the Amendment\n\nprovides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to\n\nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the\n\nUnited States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any\n\nForeign State.” The third Congress swiftly proposed and the states then ratified the\n\nAmendment after the Supreme Court decided, in Chisholm v. Georgia, that a\n\ncitizen of South Carolina could sue the State of Georgia in a federal court. 2 U.S.\n\n(2 Dall.) 419, 420, 479 (1793), superseded by constitutional amendment, U.S.\n\nConst. Amend. XI. Chisholm “created such a shock of surprise throughout the\n\ncountry that, at the first meeting of congress thereafter, the eleventh amendment to\n\nthe constitution was almost unanimously proposed” to override the decision. Hans\n\nv. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 11, 10 S. Ct. 504, 505 (1890).\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 9 of 34\n\n\n       We understand the Eleventh Amendment in the light of this history and “not\n\nso much for what it says, but for the presupposition which it confirms.” Seminole\n\nTribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 1122 (1996) (internal\n\nquotation mark and alteration omitted). That presupposition is two-fold: each state\n\nis a separate sovereign, and each state, as a sovereign, cannot be haled into a\n\nfederal court without its consent. Id. Any contrary understanding of state sovereign\n\nimmunity “is an attempt to strain the constitution and the law to a construction\n\nnever imagined or dreamed of.” Hans, 134 U.S. at 15, 10 S. Ct. at 507.\n\n       In its complaint, the Tribe seeks declaratory judgments that it is exempt from\n\nthe fuel tax under the Indian Commerce Clause, the Indian sovereignty doctrine,\n\nand the Equal Protection Clause and an injunction that would bar the Department\n\nand its Director from refusing to issue refunds of fuel taxes the Tribe has paid, but\n\nthe sovereign immunity of Florida bars this complaint. Although Congress has the\n\nexclusive authority to regulate the internal affairs of Indian tribes, state sovereign\n\nimmunity “is not so ephemeral as to dissipate when the subject of the suit is an\n\narea . . . under the exclusive control of the Federal Government.” Seminole Tribe,\n\n517 U.S. at 72, 116 S. Ct. at 1131. The sovereign immunity of Florida extends to\n\nboth the Department and its Director. We discuss the immunity of each defendant\n\nin turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014   Page: 10 of 34\n\n\n      An Indian tribe can sue a state and its departments in federal court only if\n\nCongress has validly abrogated the immunity of the state or if the state has waived\n\nits immunity, but neither of those conditions has occurred here. Congress has not\n\nabrogated the sovereign immunity of Florida from suits by Indian tribes for money\n\ndamages or for injunctive or declaratory relief. See Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of\n\nIdaho, 521 U.S. 261, 269, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 2034 (1997) (ruling that sovereign\n\nimmunity of Idaho barred suit for injunctive and declaratory relief); Seminole\n\nTribe, 517 U.S. at 72, 116 S. Ct. at 1131 (ruling that the Indian Commerce Clause\n\ndid not empower Congress to abrogate the sovereign immunity of Florida);\n\nBlatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 788, 111 S. Ct. 2578, 2585–86\n\n(1991) (holding that a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1362, providing federal\n\njurisdiction for suits by Indian tribes, did not abrogate state sovereign immunity for\n\nsuits for money damages). And Florida has not waived its sovereign immunity\n\nfrom this federal suit. Without a valid abrogation by Congress, Florida, “an\n\nunconsenting State,” is immune from suit “regardless of the nature of the relief\n\nsought.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S. Ct.\n\n900, 908 (1984) (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\n      The Tribe also cannot circumvent the sovereign immunity of Florida by\n\nsuing the Director of the Department based on the decision in Ex parte Young, 209\n\nU.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441 (1908). To be sure, a federal court has jurisdiction to\n\n                                          10\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 11 of 34\n\n\nentertain suits against individual officers of a state “who threaten and are about to\n\ncommence proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce . . . an\n\nunconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution.” Id. at 155–56, 28 S. Ct. at\n\n452; see also Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart, ___ U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct.\n\n1632, 1638 (2011) (“[W]hen a federal court commands a state official to do\n\nnothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the State for\n\nsovereign-immunity purposes.”). But the Tribe cannot wiggle into this exception\n\nthrough creative pleading. See Coeur d’ Alene, 521 U.S. at 270, 117 S. Ct. at 2034\n\n(“The real interests served by the Eleventh Amendment are not to be sacrificed to\n\nelementary mechanics of captions and pleading.”). When the Tribe names an\n\nindividual officer as a defendant in its complaint, we must ask whether the suit is\n\n“in essence one for the recovery of money from the state.” Ford Motor Co. v.\n\nDep’t of Treasury of Ind., 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S. Ct. 347, 350 (1945), overruled\n\nin part, Lapides v. Bd. of Regents, 535 U.S. 613, 622–23, 122 S. Ct. 1640, 1645–46\n\n(2002) (holding that a state might waive its sovereign immunity when it removes a\n\ncase to federal court and overruling Ford Motor Co. only insofar as it is\n\ninconsistent with the waiver rule in Lapides). If it is, then “the state is the real,\n\nsubstantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from\n\nsuit even though individual officers are nominal defendants.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 12 of 34\n\n\n      The Department, not the Director, is the “real, substantial party in interest”\n\nin this suit. Id. In Ford Motor Company, the Supreme Court explained that a suit\n\nfor a tax refund that named individual officers as defendants was in fact a suit\n\nagainst the state and barred by sovereign immunity. Id. at 463, 65 S. Ct. at 350.\n\nIndiana law required a taxpayer to initiate an action against the “department” for\n\ntaxes illegally exacted, and any judgment obtained from that action would be\n\nsatisfied by “funds in the state treasury.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting Ind. Stat. Ann. § 64-2614(b) (1943)). The Supreme Court ruled that the\n\nIndiana statute “clearly provide[d] for a[n] action against the state, as opposed to\n\none against the collecting official individually,” and the federal suit “therefore\n\nconstitute[d] an action against the state, not against the collecting official as an\n\nindividual.” Id. In the same manner that Ford joined the members of the Indiana\n\nDepartment of the Treasury in Ford Motor Company, the Tribe has joined the\n\nDirector of the Department as a “representative[] of the state, not as [an]\n\nindividual[] against whom a personal judgment is sought.” Id. at 463–64, 65 S. Ct.\n\nat 350. Its “claim is for a ‘refund,’ not for the imposition of personal liability on\n\nindividual defendants for sums illegally exacted.” Id. at 464, 65 S. Ct. at 350.\n\n      Moreover, the relief that the Tribe seeks is equitable in name only. This suit\n\nis not to enjoin an individual officer from committing a violation of federal law; it\n\nis instead a suit for monetary relief to be financed by the Florida fisc. See Va.\n\n                                           12\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 13 of 34\n\n\nOffice for Prot. & Advocacy, 131 S. Ct. at 1639 (“Ex parte Young cannot be used\n\nto obtain an injunction requiring the payment of funds from the State’s treasury.”).\n\nA declaratory ruling that the Tribe is exempt from the tax would amount to a\n\njudgment that the Tribe is entitled to a refund under Florida law. See Fla. Stat.\n\n§ 206.41(4), (5). The tax is precollected from suppliers of fuel, so every consumer\n\nmust pay the tax at the pump, and any exempt consumer may then collect a refund\n\nafter-the-fact. Id. § 206.41(5). And a judgment “[e]njoining the Department and its\n\nExecutive Director’s continued and prospective refusal to refund the Fuel Tax,” as\n\nthe Tribe demands in its complaint, would amount to a money judgment against\n\nFlorida. The Tribe seeks a refund paid by the State, not from the director’s pocket.\n\nSee Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 668, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 1358 (1974). We\n\ncannot declare the Tribe exempt from the fuel tax, nor can we enjoin the\n\nDepartment and its individual officer to pay the Tribe a refund. Granting either\n\nform of relief would be tantamount to a judgment that Florida must pay the Tribe\n\ncash from state coffers. State sovereign immunity forecloses that relief.\n\n      We reject our dissenting colleague’s contention that sovereign immunity\n\ndoes not bar a declaratory judgment exempting the Tribe from the tax, which he\n\nargues is somehow different from a declaratory judgment and an injunction\n\nrequiring a refund of the tax. Either form of relief is equivalent to “a retroactive\n\naward which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury.” Edelman, 415\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 14 of 34\n\n\nU.S. at 677, 94 S. Ct. at 1362. As the Tribe alleges in its complaint, the Florida\n\nstatute “provides exemptions from the Fuel Tax,” and “[a]ny consumer who pre-\n\npays the Fuel Tax at the pump and then uses the fuel for an exempt purpose is\n\nentitled to a refund of the Fuel Tax.” The right to an exemption is the right to a\n\nrefund under Florida law, and sovereign immunity bars that relief because it is\n\ncompensatory in nature and because Florida is the real, substantial party in interest.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague argues that the relief the Tribe seeks is prospective,\n\nbut he fails to explain how that relief is anything other than an award of damages\n\neven if it could conceivably be described as prospective in nature. The doctrine of\n\nsovereign immunity requires us to ask more than whether relief is “prospective” or\n\n“retrospective.” “Prospective” relief will not overcome the sovereign immunity of\n\na state when that relief is an award of money damages camouflaged as an\n\ninjunction or a declaratory judgment. The Tribe labels the relief it seeks as a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, but that label does not end our inquiry. In Edelman, the\n\nSupreme Court rejected the argument that Ex parte Young allows “any form of\n\nrelief[,] . . . no matter how closely it may in practice resemble a money judgment\n\npayable out of the state treasury, so long as the relief may be labeled ‘equitable’ in\n\nnature.” 415 U.S. at 666–67, 94 S. Ct. at 1357; see also Papasan v. Allain, 478\n\nU.S. 265, 279, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 2941 (1986) (“[W]e look to the substance rather\n\nthan to the form of the relief sought.”). When, as in this appeal, prospective relief\n\n                                          14\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 15 of 34\n\n\nis the “functional equivalent of money damages,” Ex parte Young does not apply.\n\nSummit Med. Assoc., P.C. v. Pryor, 180 F.3d 1326, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999); see also\n\nVa. Office for Prot. & Advocacy, 131 S. Ct. at 1643 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n\n(highlighting that the Supreme Court in Edelman “applied the [Ex parte Young]\n\nexception to an affirmative prospective order but not to equitable restitution, for\n\nthe latter was too similar to an award of damages against the State”). A declaratory\n\njudgment exempting the Tribe from the tax is the functional equivalent of ordering\n\nrecurring payments of money damages. The Tribe points to no other way around\n\nthe alleged constitutional violation other than a recurring refund paid to the Tribe\n\nfrom the Department after it precollects the tax from the fuel suppliers.\n\n      The injunctive relief sought in the decisions upon which the dissent relies is\n\nmaterially different from the compensatory relief the Tribe seeks here. When a\n\nTribe challenges the assessment of a tax by a tax collector, the Tribe might sue to\n\nenjoin the tax collector from collecting the illegally assessed tax. That suit asks\n\nonly that the tax collector not come upon the Tribe’s land to collect the tax, and\n\neveryone’s money stays in everyone’s pockets. In that suit, “no award of any\n\nmoney need be made from the state treasury. Instead, money which state officials\n\nwould otherwise collect from the [plaintiffs], in violation of federal law, will be\n\nprotected from collection.” CSX Transp. Inc. v. Bd. of Pub. Works of W. Va., 138\n\nF.3d 537, 542 (4th Cir. 1998); see id. (“The Railroads have not lost any money: the\n\n                                          15\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 16 of 34\n\n\nmoney allegedly illegally assessed is still safely in their pockets.”). But in this suit,\n\nthe Tribe will already have paid a fuel supplier, who is not a party to this suit, for\n\nthe taxes that the supplier paid to the Department. The declaratory judgment that\n\nthe Tribe seeks would demand that the tax collector award the Tribe money from\n\nstate coffers equaling the amount of fuel taxes that the Department would already\n\nhave collected from the supplier. Whether the tribe labels the relief it seeks as an\n\n“exemption” or a “refund,” that relief is compensatory and is not allowed under Ex\n\nparte Young. See Papasan, 478 U.S. at 280–81, 106 S. Ct. at 2942 (“We discern no\n\nsubstantive difference between not-yet-extinguished liability for a past breach of\n\ntrust and the continuing obligation to meet trust responsibilities asserted by the\n\npetitioners. In both cases, the trustee is required, because of the past loss of the\n\ntrust corpus, to use its own resources to take the place of the corpus or the lost\n\nincome from the corpus.”); Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68, 106 S. Ct. 423, 426\n\n(1985) (“But compensatory or deterrence interests are insufficient to overcome the\n\ndictates of the Eleventh Amendment.”).\n\n      To be sure, some prospective relief against individual officers allowed by Ex\n\nparte Young may cost states money, but we must ask whether the expenditure of\n\nstate funds is a necessary result of compliance with an injunction or a declaratory\n\njudgment or whether the expenditure is instead the “goal in itself.” Lucky v. Harris,\n\n860 F.2d 1012, 1014–15 (11th Cir. 1988); see also Edelman, 415 U.S. at 667–68,\n\n                                           16\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 17 of 34\n\n\n94 S. Ct. at 1358 (permitting prospective injunctive relief with “an ancillary effect\n\non the state treasury” (emphasis added)). In Milliken v. Bradley, for example, the\n\nSupreme Court ruled that a federal court could require a state to institute school\n\nprograms to eliminate the vestiges of racial segregation even though the\n\nestablishment of those programs would cost the state money. 433 U.S. 267, 289–\n\n90, 97 S. Ct. 2749, 2762 (1977). But the Supreme Court distinguished the relief\n\nallowed in Milliken from relief involving “individual citizens’ conducting a raid on\n\nthe state treasury for an accrued monetary liability.” Id. at 290 n.22, 97 S. Ct. at\n\n2762 n.22. Here, the expenditure of state funds is the goal in itself. A raid on the\n\nstate treasury is precisely what is at stake in this appeal because an exemption from\n\nthe tax entitles the taxpayer to a refund of the tax. The only relief the Tribe has\n\nrequested is a declaratory judgment entitling it to a check made out from the\n\nFlorida fisc whether today or in the future.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague also faults us for crafting a “precollection\n\nexception” to Ex parte Young, but we have not created such an exception. We have\n\ninstead considered the structure of the Florida tax scheme to determine whether the\n\nreal, substantial party in interest is the individual officer or the State. Our\n\ndissenting colleague cites no authority for his contention that states cannot legislate\n\ntheir way around Ex parte Young, and Ford Motor Company stands for the\n\nopposite proposition. See Ford Motor Co., 323 U.S. at 463, 65 S. Ct. at 350 (“This\n\n                                           17\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 18 of 34\n\n\nsection [of the Indiana statute] clearly provides for a[n] action against the state, as\n\nopposed to one against the collecting official individually.”). For the reasons stated\n\nabove, Florida is the real, substantial party in interest to this suit because of the\n\nmanner in which Florida has structured the collection of its fuel tax. The Tribe has\n\nnever challenged the precollection of the fuel tax; instead, the Tribe has always\n\ncontended that it should be exempt from the tax and, therefore, entitled to a refund\n\nof taxes already paid or taxes to be paid in the future. Such a suit will always be “in\n\nessence one for the recovery of money from the state” and is necessarily a suit\n\nagainst the State. Id. at 463–64, 65 S. Ct. at 350. And the authorities both our\n\ndissenting colleague and the Tribe rely upon do not convince us otherwise; none of\n\nthose decisions involved a precollected tax that the state would have to refund. In\n\nAgua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians v. Hardin, for example, a tribe sought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that federal law preempted a sales and use tax imposed on\n\ntribal lands and an injunction against state officers from collecting the tax before\n\nthe tribe paid it. 223 F.3d 1041, 1043–44 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Muscogee\n\n(Creek) Nation v. Pruitt, 669 F.3d 1159, 1162–68 (10th Cir. 2012) (involving a\n\nchallenge to a tobacco tax that required placement of tax stamps on tobacco\n\nproducts and payment of funds into state escrow fund); Sac & Fox Nation of\n\nMissouri v. Pierce, 213 F.3d 566, 569–70 (10th Cir. 2000) (involving a declaratory\n\njudgment that federal law preempted the state tax on fuel distributed to retail\n\n                                           18\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 19 of 34\n\n\nstations on tribal lands and an injunction barring the collection of the tax); CSX\n\nTransp. Inc., 138 F.3d at 542 (“The district court further erred in holding that the\n\ninjunction was retrospective because it sought a refund or credit . . . [t]he Railroads\n\nseek nothing of the kind.”). Unlike the tax regimes in those appeals, the only relief\n\navailable to the Tribe under Florida law is a refund of taxes it will already have\n\npaid, and state sovereign immunity bars that relief. See Ford Motor Co., 323 U.S.\n\nat 463–64, 65 S. Ct. at 350.\n\n      We must also address our dissenting colleague’s speculation about the\n\ndifferent methods Florida could employ to stop precollecting the tax from the\n\nTribe, which we reject for three reasons. First, we are not free to rewrite the\n\nFlorida statutes so that the Tribe may circumvent the sovereign immunity of\n\nFlorida and sue its individual officers. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 75–76, 116\n\nS. Ct. at 1133. Any future change to the collection of fuel taxes in Florida is a\n\nmatter of public policy to be debated by the Florida legislature, perhaps at the\n\nurging of the Tribe, but not a matter of law to be decided by a federal court in a\n\nlawsuit filed by the Tribe. Second, our dissenting colleague’s hypothetical tax-free\n\nfuel rate, coupons, or vouchers are overly broad and impractical. The Tribe alleges\n\nthat only a portion of the fuel it purchases is exempt from the tax, not all of it.\n\nPerhaps the dissent envisions that the fuel supplier would make two separate sales\n\nto the Tribe, one sale of taxed fuel and one sale of tax-exempt fuel used for\n\n                                           19\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 20 of 34\n\n\nessential government services. His speculation unrealistically assumes that either\n\nthe Tribe or the fuel supplier would be able to project the amount of tax-exempt\n\nfuel the Tribe would use down to a one-hundredth of a gallon. That unrealistic\n\nassumption illuminates why a federal court is wholly unsuited to instruct a state\n\nlegislature about how best to collect fuel taxes. Third and most importantly, the\n\nTribe never asked for such an unworkable form of relief.\n\n      Finally, our dissenting colleague frets that the Tribe cannot access a federal\n\ncourt to vindicate its alleged constitutional claim, but he fails to consider that the\n\nTribe has the opportunity to seek review from the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates should the Tribe challenge the tax in state court as it has done before.\n\nCompare McKesson Corp. v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverages & Tobacco, Dep’t of\n\nBus. Regulation of Fla., 496 U.S. 18, 27, 110 S. Ct. 2238, 2245 (1990) (“We have\n\nrepeatedly and without question accepted jurisdiction to review issues of federal\n\nlaw arising in suits brought against States in state court; indeed, we frequently have\n\nentertained cases analogous to this one, where a taxpayer who had brought a\n\nrefund action in state court against the State asked us to reverse an adverse state\n\njudicial decision premised upon federal law.” (footnote omitted)), with Reich v.\n\nCollins, 513 U.S. 106, 109–10, 115 S.

Rossiter ed.\n\n1961) (Hamilton). Florida has not consented to this suit, and we cannot adjudicate\n\nwhether Florida must grant the Tribe an exemption from the fuel tax or pay the\n\nTribe a refund from its fisc.\n\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We AFFIRM the dismissal of the complaint filed by the Seminole Tribe of\n\nFlorida.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 22 of 34\n\n\nJORDAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n      I join the majority’s opinion with respect to the dismissal of Counts III-VI,\n\nwhich expressly seek injunctive relief in the form of refunds to the Tribe of\n\nFlorida’s already-collected fuel taxes, but respectfully dissent from the dismissal of\n\nCounts I and II, which seek a declaratory judgment against Florida officials that\n\nthe future imposition of certain fuel taxes violates the Constitution.\n\n                                            I\n\n      “[S]overeign immunity . . . generally bar[s] tax refund claims from being\n\nbrought in [federal court].” Reich v.

Because\n\nCounts III-VI of the Tribe’s complaint seek “the recovery of money from the\n\n[S]tate” through refunds, I concur with the majority that “the [S]tate is the real,\n\nsubstantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from\n\nsuit even though individual officials are nominal defendants.” Ford Motor Co. v.\n\nDep’t of Treasury of Ind., 323 U.S. 459, 464 (1945) (holding that a taxpayer’s suit\n\nagainst state treasury officials for “a refund of gross income taxes paid” was an\n\naction against the state and barred by the Eleventh Amendment). See also DeKalb\n\nCnty. Sch. Dist. v. Schrenko, 109 F.3d 680, 691 (11th Cir. 1997) (“[I]t is obvious\n\nthat this is, in reality, a suit against the State itself.

Significantly,\n\nCounts I and II do not ask for refunds, but rather seek only a declaration that fuel\n\npurchased by the Tribe for use on tribal land or in the provision of essential\n\ngovernmental services is exempt from the fuel tax under the Indian Commerce\n\nClause, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Such relief, in my opinion, is permitted under\n\nEx parte Young, which generally allows suits for declaratory and prospective relief\n\nagainst state officials in charge of administering or enforcing unconstitutional laws.\n\nSee Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 1638 (2011).1\n\n                                                A\n\n       Though it may be an “expedient ‘fiction,’” Ex parte Young is “necessary to\n\nensure the supremacy of federal law.” Cent. Va. Cmty. College v. Katz, 546 U.S.\n\n356, 378 n.14 (2006) (citation omitted). Accordingly, “[i]n determining whether\n\nthe doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court\n\nneed only conduct a ‘straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges\n\nan ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as\n\n\n       1\n         The Florida officials who have been sued here are proper defendants under Ex parte\nYoung, as they, “by virtue of [their] offices, ha[ve] some connection with the unconstitutional act\nor conduct complained of.” Luckey v.

Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645\n\n(2002) (citation omitted and alteration in original).\n\n      Counts I and II satisfy this straightforward inquiry. They allege an ongoing\n\nviolation of federal law, i.e., that Florida’s fuel tax violates (and will continue to\n\nviolate) the Indian Commerce Clause as applied to fuel purchased by the Tribe for\n\nuse on tribal land or in the provision of essential governmental services. See\n\nComplaint, D.E. 1 at ¶¶ 30, 37. And they seek, at least in part, a declaration that\n\nfuel which has yet to be purchased or taxed is not subject to the tax when it is used\n\nby the Tribe on tribal land or in the provision of essential governmental services.\n\nSee id. at ¶¶ 33, 38. Such “relief [is] properly characterized as prospective.”\n\nVerizon Md., 535 U.S. at 645 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The majority relies heavily on Ford Motor Co., but that case is easily\n\ndistinguishable. First, the taxpayer there expressly sought a “refund of gross\n\nincome taxes paid.” 323 U.S. at 460. Second, the taxpayer sued under a state\n\nstatute which provided for an action against the state itself. See id. at 462-63.\n\nHere, as noted earlier, Counts I and II seek only a declaratory judgment that the\n\nfuture imposition and collection of Florida’s fuel tax would be unconstitutional,\n\nand, in Counts I and II, the Tribe sued the interim executive director and deputy\n\nexecutive director pursuant to Ex parte Young.\n\n\n\n\n                                           24\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 25 of 34\n\n\n      As the Supreme Court and various circuits have recognized, the Eleventh\n\nAmendment does not bar prospective challenges to allegedly unconstitutional state\n\ntaxes when such suits are “brought against state officers in their official capacity\n\nand not against the State in its own name.” Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak,\n\n501 U.S. 775, 785 & n.3 (1991) (“Absent [the Tax Injunction Act], state taxes\n\ncould constitutionally be enjoined.”). See also Muscogee (Creek) Nation v. Pruitt,\n\n669 F.3d 1159, 1168 (10th Cir. 2012) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment did\n\nnot bar claims for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief in a suit challenging\n\nOklahoma statutes that taxed and regulated the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco\n\nproducts); Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians v. Hardin, 223 F.3d 1041, 1049\n\n(9th Cir. 2000) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar an Indian tribe\n\nfrom seeking a declaratory judgment precluding the imposition of California’s\n\nsales and use tax on purchases of food and beverages by non-tribal members at a\n\ntribal resort on reservation land); CSX Transp., Inc. v. Bd. of Pub. Works of the\n\nState of W. Va., 138 F.3d 537, 541 (4th Cir. 1998) (“An injunction against the\n\nfuture collection of illegal taxes, even those that already have been assessed, is\n\nprospective, and therefore available under the Ex parte Young doctrine.”). The\n\nonly distinction here is that Florida precollects its fuel tax from suppliers for mere\n\n“administrative convenience,” Fla. Stat. § 206.41(4)(a), but that is a distinction\n\nwithout a difference, and the majority’s opinion therefore creates a circuit split.\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 26 of 34\n\n\n      Florida’s choice to precollect the challenged fuel tax now and in the future\n\ndoes not somehow transform the Tribe’s requested declaratory relief from\n\npermissibly prospective to impermissibly retrospective. Retrospective relief is\n\nbackward-looking, and seeks to remedy harm “resulting from a past breach of a\n\nlegal duty on the part of the defendant state officials.” Edelman v. Jordan, 415\n\nU.S. 651, 668 (1974) (emphasis added). To illustrate, the Supreme Court held in\n\nEdelman that a judgment requiring the state to pay wrongfully withheld welfare\n\nbenefits amounted to a “retroactive award of monetary relief” because it\n\n“require[d] payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance\n\nin the future with a substantive federal-question determination, but as a form of\n\ncompensation to those whose applications were [incorrectly] processed” before the\n\nplaintiffs had filed suit. Id. By contrast, the alleged harm here does not arise from\n\nthe past breach of a legal duty; it results from the future and continuing imposition\n\nof an allegedly unconstitutional tax on fuel that has yet to be purchased or taxed.\n\nSee, e.g., CSX Transp., 138 F.3d at 542 (rejecting argument “that an injunction\n\nagainst the future collection of illegal taxes is retrospective and unavailable merely\n\nbecause the state has already decided how much tax to collect, even though the\n\nmoney is still safely in the taxpayer’s pocket”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 27 of 34\n\n\n                                           B\n\n      Were the Tribe to prevail in its constitutional challenge—a matter on which\n\nI do not express any views—the district court would issue a declaratory judgment\n\nthat the fuel tax could not be applied to future purchases of fuel by the Tribe for\n\nuse on tribal land and in the provision of essential governmental services. The\n\nmajority believes that such a judgment would be tantamount to an order requiring\n\nFlorida to issue refunds. But it is difficult to understand, linguistically or\n\notherwise, how asking to stop something that is going to continue indefinitely into\n\nthe future can be legally characterized as a retrospective demand for payment of\n\nmoney already in the State’s treasury. There are obviously fuel taxes that Florida\n\nhas not yet precollected, not even from suppliers, and for such unassessed future\n\ntaxes (say, for example, taxes that will be precollected in May of 2015, a year from\n\nnow) any declaratory relief necessarily has to be prospective. How can a taxpayer\n\npossibly seek or get a refund—defined as a “sum repaid,” 2 Shorter Oxford\n\nEnglish Dictionary 2510 (5th ed. 2002), or “[t]he return of money to a person who\n\noverpaid,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1394 (9th ed. 2009)—for a tax that has not yet\n\nbeen paid by anyone?\n\n      Likewise, it is impossible to characterize a judgment which declares the\n\nfuture imposition and collection of taxes unconstitutional as an award of damages.\n\n“Traditional money damages are payable to compensate for the harm of past\n\n                                           27\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014   Page: 28 of 34\n\n\nconduct, which subsists whether future harm is threatened or not.” Friends of the\n\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 211 n.5 (2000)\n\n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). See also F.T.C. v. Leshin, 719 F.3d 1227,\n\n1232 (11th Cir. 2013) (“The most common combination of equitable and legal\n\nremedies, for instance, is a district court’s grant of both an injunction that prevents\n\nfuture harm along with an award of damages that compensates for past harm.”).\n\n      The Florida officials sued here could choose to abide by any adverse\n\ndeclaratory judgment by providing any form of relief that would cure the\n\nunconstitutional application of the fuel tax. Cf. McKesson Corp. v. Div. of\n\nAlcoholic Beverages & Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18, 51 (1990) (“When a State penalizes\n\ntaxpayers for failure to remit their taxes in a timely fashion, thus requiring them to\n\npay first before obtaining review of the tax’s validity, federal due process\n\nprinciples long recognized by our cases require the State’s postdeprivation\n\nprocedure to provide a ‘clear and certain remedy[ ]’ for the deprivation of tax\n\nmoneys in an unconstitutional manner.”) (citation omitted). For example, the\n\nFlorida officials could comply with a declaratory judgment by eliminating or\n\nmodifying, in whole or in part, the procedure for the precollection of fuel taxes\n\nwith respect to future purchases of fuel by the Tribe; they could require gas\n\nstations to charge members of the Tribe a different, tax-exempt price on fuel\n\npurchased for use on tribal lands or in the provision of essential governmental\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 29 of 34\n\n\nservices; or they could issue coupons or vouchers—which could later be\n\nreconciled—entitling the Tribe to a discount of the purchase price.\n\n      If the Florida officials refused to abide by a declaratory judgment and\n\ncontinued enforcing (and collecting) the fuel tax from the Tribe in an\n\nunconstitutional manner, the district court could enforce its judgment through\n\ncontempt proceedings, as happened in Ex parte Young itself, see 209 U.S. at 159-\n\n60 (upholding lower court’s order of contempt, which committed a state attorney\n\ngeneral to federal custody for violating a federal injunction barring enforcement of\n\nstate law held to be unconstitutional), or through financial penalties, as explained\n\nin Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 690 (1978) (“In exercising their prospective\n\npowers under Ex parte Young and Edelman . . . , federal courts are not reduced to\n\nissuing injunctions against state officers and hoping for compliance. Once issued,\n\nan injunction may be enforced. Many of the court’s most effective enforcement\n\nweapons include financial penalties.”) (citations omitted).\n\n      Should the State decide not to change its precollection scheme as to future\n\ntaxes and wish to avoid contempt proceedings or the imposition of financial\n\npenalties, then it is likely that the Florida officials would have to issue refunds to\n\nthe Tribe in order to comply with any declaratory judgment exempting the Tribe\n\nfrom the fuel tax in the future. But in that scenario the issuance of refunds would\n\nbe the result of a choice made by Florida, see Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 347\n\n                                           29\n\f               Case: 13-10566        Date Filed: 05/05/2014        Page: 30 of 34\n\n\n(1979), and the existence of an Eleventh Amendment bar does not depend on the\n\nmere difficulty (or expense) of compliance with a prospective federal decree. See\n\nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289 (1977) (“[Ex parte Young] permits federal\n\ncourts to enjoin state officials to conform their conduct to requirements of federal\n\nlaw, notwithstanding a direct and substantial impact on the state treasury.”). 2\n\n                                                 C\n\n       The majority’s opinion, as I read it, apparently would allow a state to shield\n\nthe enforcement of any tax, no matter how constitutionally untenable, from\n\nchallenge in federal court simply by enacting a precollection procedure. But there\n\nis no “precollection exception” to Ex parte Young, and the supremacy of federal\n\nlaw does not rest on the type of tax scheme that Florida has designed. States\n\ncannot legislate their way around Ex parte Young, and in other contexts the\n\nSupreme Court has made clear that the supremacy of federal law is not dependent\n\non the ingenuity of obstacles created by state law. See Haywood v. Drown, 556\n\nU.S. 729, 739 (2009) (“A [state] jurisdictional rule cannot be used as a device to\n\n\n       2\n           I note, as well, that the Supreme Court has not hesitated to enforce a lower court’s\nmandamus order requiring county auditors and county treasurers, who were employed by the\nstate, to levy a tax to pay a federal judgment even though those officials were not permitted to\nimpose such a tax under state law. See Graham v. Folson, 200 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1906)\n(rejecting argument that the mandamus relief was effectively relief against the state itself). If\nforcing such officials to impose a tax prohibited by state law is not constitutionally problematic,\nrequiring Florida officials to exempt the Tribe from the fuel tax in the future isn’t either. See\nalso Milliken, 433 U.S. at 289 (affirming a district court order requiring the state to pay half of a\ncourt-ordered desegregation plan even though the Ex parte Young defendants were only state\nenforcement officials).\n                                                 30\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 31 of 34\n\n\nundermine federal law, no matter how evenhanded it may appear.”); Crosby v.\n\nNat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 372-73 (2000) (“We will find\n\npreemption . . . where ‘under the circumstances of [a] particular case, [the\n\nchallenged state law] stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of\n\nthe full purposes and objectives of Congress.’”) (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312\n\nU.S. 52, 67 (1941)) (second and third alterations in original).\n\n      “Remedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are\n\nnecessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of that law.”\n\nGreen v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985). The Tribe’s requested declaratory\n\nrelief in Counts I and II fulfills this function because it seeks to “ensure that the\n\nstate [fuel] tax be applied [in the future] by [Florida] officials in a manner\n\nconsistent with federal law.” Agua Caliente, 223 F.3d at 1049. As a result, I do\n\nnot believe that Counts I and II are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n                                           II\n\n      Because the majority affirms across the board on Eleventh Amendment\n\ngrounds, it does not reach the Tribe’s arguments that the district court erred in\n\ndismissing the complaint under the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), 28 U.S.C. § 1341,\n\nand the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, based on Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S.\n\n413 (1923), and District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 32 of 34\n\n\n(1983). Because I would allow Counts I and II to proceed under Ex parte Young, I\n\nwrite to briefly explain why neither of these other jurisdictional barriers applies.\n\n      Although the TIA generally prohibits federal courts from “enjoin[ing],\n\nsuspend[ing] or restrain[ing] the . . . collection of any tax under State law,” 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1341, it does not apply to Indian tribes “seeking to enjoin the enforcement\n\nof a state tax law” in a suit brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1362. See Moe v.\n\nConfederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U.S. 463, 474-75 (1976). See also\n\nBlatchford, 501 U.S. at 785 (explaining that “Moe held § 1362 to eliminate [the\n\nTIA’s] application to tribal suits”). The district court’s contrary conclusion, based\n\non its determination that “the applicability of the TIA in this case hinges on the\n\nlocus of the fuel tax,” D.E. 27 at 9, in my view conflates the merits of the Tribe’s\n\nclaims with the jurisdictional inquiry demanded by the intersection of the TIA and\n\n§ 1362. Whether (or not) the TIA applies does not depend on whether the Tribe\n\nwill succeed on its claims. I would therefore reverse the district court’s dismissal\n\nof the Tribe’s claims under the TIA.\n\n      I would also set aside the district court’s dismissal of the Tribe’s claims\n\nunder the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. “The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is . . .\n\nconfined to . . . cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused\n\nby state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced\n\nand inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.” Exxon Mobil\n\n                                          32\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 33 of 34\n\n\nCorp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005). See also Brown v.\n\nR.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 611 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir. 2010) (“The doctrine\n\nbars the losing party in state court ‘from seeking what in substance would be\n\nappellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court, based on the\n\nlosing party’s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser’s federal\n\nrights.’”) (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1005-06 (1994)). It “does\n\nnot otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine.” Exxon Mobil, 544 U.S. at\n\n284. See also Bates v. Harvey, 518 F.3d 1233, 1240 (11th Cir. 2008) (“The\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine is distinct from issue preclusion. . . .”).\n\n      The district court dismissed the Tribe’s claims because the Fourth District,\n\nin Florida Department of Revenue v. Seminole Tribe of Florida, 65 So. 3d 1094\n\n(Fla. 4th DCA 2011) (“Seminole Tribe I”), had “addressed precisely the same\n\nissues contained in the claims in the instant suit.” D.E. 27 at 6. In so ruling, the\n\ndistrict court “expanded Rooker-Feldman’s jurisdictional bar to include federal\n\nactions that simply raise claims previously litigated in state court.” Exxon Mobil,\n\n544 U.S. at 287 n.2. See also id. at 293 (Rooker-Feldman does not “stop a district\n\ncourt from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts\n\nto litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court”).\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 34 of 34\n\n\n                                         III\n\n      In our constitutional scheme, sovereign immunity “works only because of\n\nthe exceptions to it,” and the “most important of these” is “the suit against an\n\nofficer” under Ex parte Young. John T. Noonan, Narrowing the Nation’s Power:\n\nThe Supreme Court Sides with the States 85 (2002). The Eleventh Amendment, in\n\nmy mind, does not bar Counts I and II of the Tribe’s complaint under Ex parte\n\nYoung. I would therefore set aside the dismissal of these Counts, and remand for\n\nthe district court to determine whether the Fourth District’s judgment in Seminole\n\nTribe I is entitled to preclusive effect under Florida law, and/or whether Counts I\n\nand II should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.

BACKGROUND\n\n      The Seminole Tribe of Florida is a federally recognized Indian tribe. See\n\nIndian Entities Recognized & Eligible to Receive Services from the United States\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs, 78 Fed. Reg. 26,384, 26,387 (May 6, 2013); Indian\n\nReorganization Act of June 18, 1934, § 16, ch. 576, 48 Stat. 984, 987 (codified as\n\namended at 25 U.S.C. § 476). Like any other entity in Florida, the Tribe pays a\n\nstate tax on the purchase of fuel. See Fla. Stat. § 206.01 et seq. The State, counties,\n\nand municipalities use revenues from that tax to construct and repair transportation\n\nfacilities, roads, bridges, and paths. See, e.g., Fla. Const. Art. 12, § 9(c)(5); Fla.\n\nStat. §§ 206.60(1)(b)(1), 206.605(1), (2). For administrative convenience, the State\n\nprecollects the tax from suppliers of fuel before the suppliers sell the fuel to\n\nconsumers. See Fla. Stat. § 206.41(4)(a), (6). The cost of the tax is then passed on\n\nto the consumer of the fuel when the consumer purchases fuel at a retail gas\n\nstation. Even though the Department precollects the tax from a supplier before the\n\nfuel is sold to the ultimate consumer, Florida law provides that the “legal incidence\n\nof the tax” is “on the ultimate consumer.” Id. § 206.41(4)(a).\n\n      Florida law exempts some consumers, but not the Tribe, from the fuel tax. If\n\na consumer is exempt from the tax, then the consumer may obtain a refund from\n\nthe Department for the amount of fuel taxes the consumer has paid. Id.\n\n§ 206.41(4), (5). For example, the Department refunds any fuel taxes paid by a\n\n\n                                            3\n\f              Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 4 of 34\n\n\nmunicipality for fuel used in a municipal vehicle, and the municipality uses that\n\nrefund for the construction and maintenance of roadways within its borders. Id.\n\n§ 206.41(4)(d). Likewise, any consumer who uses fuel for agricultural,\n\naquacultural, commercial fishing, or commercial aviation purposes is exempt from\n\nthe tax and eligible for a refund from the Department. Id. § 206.41(4)(c).\n\n      Florida law does not exempt the Tribe from the fuel tax, and the Department\n\nhas refused to refund taxes the Tribe paid when it purchased fuel at gas stations\n\nlocated off tribal lands. The Tribe argues that, because it maintains its own\n\nroadways, it is entitled to a refund for taxes paid for fuel expended on tribal lands\n\nby vehicles carrying out essential government services, regardless of where the\n\nTribe purchased the fuel. The Department argues that the Tribe does not actually\n\nuse the fuel on tribal lands because Florida law defines the “use” of fuel as\n\noccurring when consumers fill the fuel tanks in their vehicles. Id. § 206.01(24)\n\n(defining “use” as “the placing of motor or diesel fuel into any receptacle on a\n\nmotor vehicle from which fuel is supplied for the propulsion thereof”).\n\n      The Tribe has twice sued the Department about whether the Tribe is exempt\n\nfrom the fuel tax. The Tribe filed the first suit in a state court and the second in a\n\nfederal court. Both times the Tribe lost.\n\n      The Tribe first sued the Department in a Florida court for a refund of fuel\n\ntaxes paid between January 1, 2004, and February 28, 2006.

The Tribe sought both declaratory judgments and an injunction in the\n\nfollowing six counts of its complaint: first, a declaratory judgment that the Tribe is\n\nexempt from the fuel tax because the tax, levied on fuel expended on tribal lands,\n\nviolates the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. Art.

The Tribe argues\n\nthat its federal complaint did not seek to overturn a previous state court judgment\n\nbecause the previous state judgment involved taxes paid between 2004 and 2006\n\nand the later federal complaint challenged taxes paid between 2009 and 2012.

Id. In Ford Motor Company, the Supreme Court explained that a suit\n\nfor a tax refund that named individual officers as defendants was in fact a suit\n\nagainst the state and barred by sovereign immunity. Id. at 463, 65 S.

The Supreme Court ruled that the\n\nIndiana statute “clearly provide[d] for a[n] action against the state, as opposed to\n\none against the collecting official individually,” and the federal suit “therefore\n\nconstitute[d] an action against the state, not against the collecting official as an\n\nindividual.” Id. In the same manner that Ford joined the members of the Indiana\n\nDepartment of the Treasury in Ford Motor Company, the Tribe has joined the\n\nDirector of the Department as a “representative[] of the state, not as [an]\n\nindividual[] against whom a personal judgment is sought.” Id. at 463–64, 65 S.

See Fla. Stat.\n\n§ 206.41(4), (5). The tax is precollected from suppliers of fuel, so every consumer\n\nmust pay the tax at the pump, and any exempt consumer may then collect a refund\n\nafter-the-fact. Id. § 206.41(5). And a judgment “[e]njoining the Department and its\n\nExecutive Director’s continued and prospective refusal to refund the Fuel Tax,” as\n\nthe Tribe demands in its complaint, would amount to a money judgment against\n\nFlorida. The Tribe seeks a refund paid by the State, not from the director’s pocket.\n\nSee Edelman v.

State sovereign immunity forecloses that relief.\n\n      We reject our dissenting colleague’s contention that sovereign immunity\n\ndoes not bar a declaratory judgment exempting the Tribe from the tax, which he\n\nargues is somehow different from a declaratory judgment and an injunction\n\nrequiring a refund of the tax. Either form of relief is equivalent to “a retroactive\n\naward which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury.” Edelman, 415\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 14 of 34\n\n\nU.S. at 677, 94 S. Ct. at 1362. As the Tribe alleges in its complaint, the Florida\n\nstatute “provides exemptions from the Fuel Tax,” and “[a]ny consumer who pre-\n\npays the Fuel Tax at the pump and then uses the fuel for an exempt purpose is\n\nentitled to a refund of the Fuel Tax.” The right to an exemption is the right to a\n\nrefund under Florida law, and sovereign immunity bars that relief because it is\n\ncompensatory in nature and because Florida is the real, substantial party in interest.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague argues that the relief the Tribe seeks is prospective,\n\nbut he fails to explain how that relief is anything other than an award of damages\n\neven if it could conceivably be described as prospective in nature. The doctrine of\n\nsovereign immunity requires us to ask more than whether relief is “prospective” or\n\n“retrospective.” “Prospective” relief will not overcome the sovereign immunity of\n\na state when that relief is an award of money damages camouflaged as an\n\ninjunction or a declaratory judgment. The Tribe labels the relief it seeks as a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, but that label does not end our inquiry. In Edelman, the\n\nSupreme Court rejected the argument that Ex parte Young allows “any form of\n\nrelief[,] . . . no matter how closely it may in practice resemble a money judgment\n\npayable out of the state treasury, so long as the relief may be labeled ‘equitable’ in\n\nnature.” 415 U.S. at 666–67, 94 S.

The Tribe points to no other way around\n\nthe alleged constitutional violation other than a recurring refund paid to the Tribe\n\nfrom the Department after it precollects the tax from the fuel suppliers.\n\n      The injunctive relief sought in the decisions upon which the dissent relies is\n\nmaterially different from the compensatory relief the Tribe seeks here. When a\n\nTribe challenges the assessment of a tax by a tax collector, the Tribe might sue to\n\nenjoin the tax collector from collecting the illegally assessed tax. That suit asks\n\nonly that the tax collector not come upon the Tribe’s land to collect the tax, and\n\neveryone’s money stays in everyone’s pockets.

But in this suit,\n\nthe Tribe will already have paid a fuel supplier, who is not a party to this suit, for\n\nthe taxes that the supplier paid to the Department.

Ct. at\n\n2762 n.22. Here, the expenditure of state funds is the goal in itself. A raid on the\n\nstate treasury is precisely what is at stake in this appeal because an exemption from\n\nthe tax entitles the taxpayer to a refund of the tax. The only relief the Tribe has\n\nrequested is a declaratory judgment entitling it to a check made out from the\n\nFlorida fisc whether today or in the future.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague also faults us for crafting a “precollection\n\nexception” to Ex parte Young, but we have not created such an exception. We have\n\ninstead considered the structure of the Florida tax scheme to determine whether the\n\nreal, substantial party in interest is the individual officer or the State. Our\n\ndissenting colleague cites no authority for his contention that states cannot legislate\n\ntheir way around Ex parte Young, and Ford Motor Company stands for the\n\nopposite proposition. See Ford Motor Co., 323 U.S. at 463, 65 S. Ct. at 350 (“This\n\n                                           17\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 18 of 34\n\n\nsection [of the Indiana statute] clearly provides for a[n] action against the state, as\n\nopposed to one against the collecting official individually.”). For the reasons stated\n\nabove, Florida is the real, substantial party in interest to this suit because of the\n\nmanner in which Florida has structured the collection of its fuel tax. The Tribe has\n\nnever challenged the precollection of the fuel tax; instead, the Tribe has always\n\ncontended that it should be exempt from the tax and, therefore, entitled to a refund\n\nof taxes already paid or taxes to be paid in the future. Such a suit will always be “in\n\nessence one for the recovery of money from the state” and is necessarily a suit\n\nagainst the State. Id. at 463–64, 65 S. Ct. at 350. And the authorities both our\n\ndissenting colleague and the Tribe rely upon do not convince us otherwise; none of\n\nthose decisions involved a precollected tax that the state would have to refund. In\n\nAgua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians v. Hardin, for example, a tribe sought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that federal law preempted a sales and use tax imposed on\n\ntribal lands and an injunction against state officers from collecting the tax before\n\nthe tribe paid it. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1043–44 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Muscogee\n\n(Creek) Nation v.

Unlike the tax regimes in those appeals, the only relief\n\navailable to the Tribe under Florida law is a refund of taxes it will already have\n\npaid, and state sovereign immunity bars that relief. See Ford Motor Co., 323 U.S.\n\nat 463–64, 65 S. Ct. at 350.\n\n      We must also address our dissenting colleague’s speculation about the\n\ndifferent methods Florida could employ to stop precollecting the tax from the\n\nTribe, which we reject for three reasons. First, we are not free to rewrite the\n\nFlorida statutes so that the Tribe may circumvent the sovereign immunity of\n\nFlorida and sue its individual officers. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 75–76, 116\n\nS. Ct. at 1133. Any future change to the collection of fuel taxes in Florida is a\n\nmatter of public policy to be debated by the Florida legislature, perhaps at the\n\nurging of the Tribe, but not a matter of law to be decided by a federal court in a\n\nlawsuit filed by the Tribe. Second, our dissenting colleague’s hypothetical tax-free\n\nfuel rate, coupons, or vouchers are overly broad and impractical. The Tribe alleges\n\nthat only a portion of the fuel it purchases is exempt from the tax, not all of it.\n\nPerhaps the dissent envisions that the fuel supplier would make two separate sales\n\nto the Tribe, one sale of taxed fuel and one sale of tax-exempt fuel used for\n\n                                           19\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 20 of 34\n\n\nessential government services. His speculation unrealistically assumes that either\n\nthe Tribe or the fuel supplier would be able to project the amount of tax-exempt\n\nfuel the Tribe would use down to a one-hundredth of a gallon. That unrealistic\n\nassumption illuminates why a federal court is wholly unsuited to instruct a state\n\nlegislature about how best to collect fuel taxes. Third and most importantly, the\n\nTribe never asked for such an unworkable form of relief.\n\n      Finally, our dissenting colleague frets that the Tribe cannot access a federal\n\ncourt to vindicate its alleged constitutional claim, but he fails to consider that the\n\nTribe has the opportunity to seek review from the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates should the Tribe challenge the tax in state court as it has done before.\n\nCompare McKesson Corp. v.

They allege an ongoing\n\nviolation of federal law, i.e., that Florida’s fuel tax violates (and will continue to\n\nviolate) the Indian Commerce Clause as applied to fuel purchased by the Tribe for\n\nuse on tribal land or in the provision of essential governmental services. See\n\nComplaint, D.E. 1 at ¶¶ 30, 37. And they seek, at least in part, a declaration that\n\nfuel which has yet to be purchased or taxed is not subject to the tax when it is used\n\nby the Tribe on tribal land or in the provision of essential governmental services.\n\nSee id. at ¶¶ 33, 38. Such “relief [is] properly characterized as prospective.”\n\nVerizon Md., 535 U.S. at 645 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The majority relies heavily on Ford Motor Co., but that case is easily\n\ndistinguishable.

Second, the taxpayer sued under a state\n\nstatute which provided for an action against the state itself.

Stat. § 206.41(4)(a), but that is a distinction\n\nwithout a difference, and the majority’s opinion therefore creates a circuit split.\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 26 of 34\n\n\n      Florida’s choice to precollect the challenged fuel tax now and in the future\n\ndoes not somehow transform the Tribe’s requested declaratory relief from\n\npermissibly prospective to impermissibly retrospective.

To illustrate, the Supreme Court held in\n\nEdelman that a judgment requiring the state to pay wrongfully withheld welfare\n\nbenefits amounted to a “retroactive award of monetary relief” because it\n\n“require[d] payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance\n\nin the future with a substantive federal-question determination, but as a form of\n\ncompensation to those whose applications were [incorrectly] processed” before the\n\nplaintiffs had filed suit. Id. By contrast, the alleged harm here does not arise from\n\nthe past breach of a legal duty; it results from the future and continuing imposition\n\nof an allegedly unconstitutional tax on fuel that has yet to be purchased or taxed.\n\nSee, e.g., CSX Transp., 138 F.3d at 542 (rejecting argument “that an injunction\n\nagainst the future collection of illegal taxes is retrospective and unavailable merely\n\nbecause the state has already decided how much tax to collect, even though the\n\nmoney is still safely in the taxpayer’s pocket”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 27 of 34\n\n\n                                           B\n\n      Were the Tribe to prevail in its constitutional challenge—a matter on which\n\nI do not express any views—the district court would issue a declaratory judgment\n\nthat the fuel tax could not be applied to future purchases of fuel by the Tribe for\n\nuse on tribal land and in the provision of essential governmental services. The\n\nmajority believes that such a judgment would be tantamount to an order requiring\n\nFlorida to issue refunds. But it is difficult to understand, linguistically or\n\notherwise, how asking to stop something that is going to continue indefinitely into\n\nthe future can be legally characterized as a retrospective demand for payment of\n\nmoney already in the State’s treasury. There are obviously fuel taxes that Florida\n\nhas not yet precollected, not even from suppliers, and for such unassessed future\n\ntaxes (say, for example, taxes that will be precollected in May of 2015, a year from\n\nnow) any declaratory relief necessarily has to be prospective. How can a taxpayer\n\npossibly seek or get a refund—defined as a “sum repaid,” 2 Shorter Oxford\n\nEnglish Dictionary 2510 (5th ed. 2002), or “[t]he return of money to a person who\n\noverpaid,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1394 (9th ed. 2009)—for a tax that has not yet\n\nbeen paid by anyone?\n\n      Likewise, it is impossible to characterize a judgment which declares the\n\nfuture imposition and collection of taxes unconstitutional as an award of damages.\n\n“Traditional money damages are payable to compensate for the harm of past\n\n                                           27\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014   Page: 28 of 34\n\n\nconduct, which subsists whether future harm is threatened or not.” Friends of the\n\nEarth, Inc. v.

For example, the\n\nFlorida officials could comply with a declaratory judgment by eliminating or\n\nmodifying, in whole or in part, the procedure for the precollection of fuel taxes\n\nwith respect to future purchases of fuel by the Tribe; they could require gas\n\nstations to charge members of the Tribe a different, tax-exempt price on fuel\n\npurchased for use on tribal lands or in the provision of essential governmental\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 13-10566      Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 29 of 34\n\n\nservices; or they could issue coupons or vouchers—which could later be\n\nreconciled—entitling the Tribe to a discount of the purchase price.\n\n      If the Florida officials refused to abide by a declaratory judgment and\n\ncontinued enforcing (and collecting) the fuel tax from the Tribe in an\n\nunconstitutional manner, the district court could enforce its judgment through\n\ncontempt proceedings, as happened in Ex parte Young itself, see 209 U.S. at 159-\n\n60 (upholding lower court’s order of contempt, which committed a state attorney\n\ngeneral to federal custody for violating a federal injunction barring enforcement of\n\nstate law held to be unconstitutional), or through financial penalties, as explained\n\nin Hutto v.

The district court’s contrary conclusion, based\n\non its determination that “the applicability of the TIA in this case hinges on the\n\nlocus of the fuel tax,” D.E. 27 at 9, in my view conflates the merits of the Tribe’s\n\nclaims with the jurisdictional inquiry demanded by the intersection of the TIA and\n\n§ 1362. Whether (or not) the TIA applies does not depend on whether the Tribe\n\nwill succeed on its claims. I would therefore reverse the district court’s dismissal\n\nof the Tribe’s claims under the TIA.\n\n      I would also set aside the district court’s dismissal of the Tribe’s claims\n\nunder the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. “The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is . . .\n\nconfined to . . . cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused\n\nby state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced\n\nand inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.” Exxon Mobil\n\n                                          32\n\f              Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014     Page: 33 of 34\n\n\nCorp. v.

See also id. at 293 (Rooker-Feldman does not “stop a district\n\ncourt from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts\n\nto litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court”).\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f             Case: 13-10566     Date Filed: 05/05/2014    Page: 34 of 34\n\n\n                                         III\n\n      In our constitutional scheme, sovereign immunity “works only because of\n\nthe exceptions to it,” and the “most important of these” is “the suit against an\n\nofficer” under Ex parte Young. John T. Noonan, Narrowing the Nation’s Power:\n\nThe Supreme Court Sides with the States 85 (2002). The Eleventh Amendment, in\n\nmy mind, does not bar Counts I and II of the Tribe’s complaint under Ex parte\n\nYoung. I would therefore set aside the dismissal of these Counts, and remand for\n\nthe district court to determine whether the Fourth District’s judgment in Seminole\n\nTribe I is entitled to preclusive effect under Florida law, and/or whether Counts I\n\nand II should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. See Appellees’ Br. at 17-22,\n\n33-39.\n\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\f</pre>",
