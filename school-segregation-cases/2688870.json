In this appeal, we determine whether an\n\nordinance imposing restrictions on the right of sex offenders to\n\nreside in the city of Lynn (city) is prohibited by the Home Rule\n\nAmendment, art. 89, ยง 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts\n\nConstitution, and the Home Rule Procedures Act, G. L. c. 43B,\n\nยง 13.    The plaintiffs, who represent a certified class of sex\n\noffenders subject to the ordinance, challenged the\n\nconstitutionality of the ordinance on various grounds.3     A judge\n\nin the Superior Court invalidated the ordinance under the Home\n\nRule Amendment.    The city appealed and we granted the\n\nplaintiffs' application for direct appellate review.      We affirm\n\nthe Superior Court judgment based on our conclusion that the\n\nordinance is inconsistent with the comprehensive statutory\n\nscheme governing the oversight of convicted sex offenders, and\n\n\n\n     3\n       The complaint alleged the following claims under the\nUnited States and Massachusetts Constitutions: (1) violation of\nthe Home Rule Amendment (Massachusetts Constitution); (2)\nviolation of the clauses prohibiting ex post facto laws; (3)\nviolation of the right to substantive due process; (4) violation\nof the right to familial association; (5) violation of the right\nto be protected from cruel and unusual punishment under the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution and cruel or unusual punishment under art. 26 of\nthe Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and (6) violation of\nthe right to travel.\n\f                                                                   3\n\n\ntherefore, it fails to pass muster under the Home Rule Amendment\n\nand the Home Rule Procedures Act.4\n\n     Background.   We summarize the undisputed facts as drawn\n\nfrom the summary judgment record.\n\n     1.    The ordinance.   The city adopted an \"Ordinance\n\nPertaining to Sex Offender Residency Restrictions in the [city]\"\n\n(ordinance) on January 12, 2011.     The stated purpose of the\n\nordinance is to \"reduce the potential risk of harm to children\n\nof the community by impacting the ability of registered sex\n\noffenders to be in contact with unsuspecting children in\n\nlocations that are primarily designed for use by, or are\n\nprimarily used by children.\"    Observing that \"[r]egistered sex\n\noffenders continue to reside in close proximity to public and\n\nprivate schools, parks and playgrounds,\" and that \"registered\n\nsex offenders will continue to move to buildings, apartments,\n\ndomiciles or residences in close proximity to schools, parks and\n\nplaygrounds,\" the city council enacted the ordinance to \"add\n\nlocation restrictions to such offenders where the [S]tate law is\n\nsilent.\"   The ordinance imposes broad restrictions, with only\n\nnarrow exceptions, on the ability of level two and level three\n\n\n     4\n       We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by Jacob Wetterling\nResource Center, Association for the Treatment of Sexual\nAbusers, Massachusetts Association for the Treatment of Sexual\nAbusers, Inc., Reform Sex Offender Laws, Inc., and Florida\nAction Committee.\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nregistered sex offenders to reside in the city.5   The ordinance\n\nestablishes the area within 1,000 feet of a school or park as a\n\nresidential exclusion zone for level two and level three sex\n\noffenders, and includes in its description of \"school\" all\n\npublic, private, and church schools, and any other business\n\npermitted as a school.   The ordinance also applies to all\n\ntemporary and permanent residences except a \"residence at a\n\nhospital or other healthcare or medical facility for less than\n\nfourteen consecutive days or fourteen (14) days in the aggregate\n\nduring any calendar year.\"   The geographical and temporal reach\n\nof the ordinance effectively prohibits all level two and level\n\nthree sex offenders from establishing residence, or even\n\nspending the night in a shelter, in ninety-five per cent of the\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The \"Ordinance Pertaining to Sex Offender Residency\nRestrictions in the City of Lynn\" (ordinance) also creates\n\"Child Safety Zones,\" wherein level two and level three sex\noffenders are prohibited from entering a school, park, or\nrecreational facility except in certain circumstances and from\n\"loiter[ing]\" within 1,000 feet of such facilities. The\nparties, however, focused their arguments on the residency\nprovision of the ordinance. The plaintiffs' motion for partial\nsummary judgment sought invalidation of the entire ordinance.\nThe city of Lynn (city) did not present any argument, and the\ncourt entered a judgment declaring that the \"Residency\nOrdinance\" violates the Home Rule Amendment. Thus, we know of\nno compelling reason to uphold any provision of the ordinance in\nlight of the comprehensive State law discussed herein.\nAccordingly, we affirm the grant of partial summary judgment in\nfavor of the plaintiffs, which invalidated the entire ordinance.\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\nresidential properties in Lynn.6   The ordinance would affect, at\n\nleast in some degree, all 212 registered level two and level\n\nthree sex offenders residing in the city, as of April 22, 2014.\n\nA sex offender required by the ordinance to move from his or her\n\nresidence could encounter similar restrictions in attempting to\n\nrelocate to nearby cities and towns.   At least forty\n\nmunicipalities have adopted sex offender residency restrictions.7\n\nThe expansive coverage of the ordinance is mitigated by narrow\n\nexceptions to the residency restrictions applicable to those who\n\n(1) have established, prior to the effective date of the\n\nordinance, a permanent residence within a restricted area by\n\npurchasing real property or by being the lessee of an unexpired\n\nlease or rental agreement; (2) are a \"minor\"; (3) are \"residing\n\n     6\n       We note here the undisputed record evidence that of the\n19,320 real estate parcels zoned as residential, 18,421 are\nlocated within 1,000 feet of a school or park.\n     7\n       According to an affidavit dated February 20, 2014,\nsubmitted as part of the summary judgment record and not\ndisputed by the city, the following list of forty municipalities\nhave enacted residency restrictions on certain sex offenders:\nAshland; Ayer; Barre; Barnstable; Braintree; Charlemont;\nCharlton; Chelsea; Colrain; Dedham; Dudley; Fall River;\nFitchburg; Framingham; Hanover; Hanson; Hopkinton; Hubbardston;\nLeominster; Lynn; Marlborough; Mendon; Natick; Norwood; Oxford;\nPembroke; Revere; Rockland; Shirley; Somerset; Southborough;\nSpencer; Springfield; Swansea; Townsend; Waltham; Warren;\nWebster; West Boylston; and Weymouth. The plaintiffs note that\nthe Attorney General's office has continued to approve similar\nregulations, citing a letter from the Attorney General to North\nReading, sent under G. L. c. 40, ยง 32, which approved North\nReading's residency restriction bylaw on January 20, 2015.\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\nwith a person related by blood or marriage within the first\n\ndegree of kindred\"; or (4) have been residing at a permanent\n\nresidence before the school or park creating the applicable\n\nrestricted area was established.\n\n    Failure to comply with the ordinance results in a penalty\n\nof $300 for each day that a sex offender subject to the\n\nordinance remains in a restricted area thirty days after\n\nreceiving a notice to move from the city, or if such sex\n\noffender moves within the city into a restricted area.\n\nAdditionally, if there is a \"subsequent offense,\" the sex\n\noffender's \"landlord, parole officer and/or probation officer,\n\nand the . . . Sex Offender Registry Board\" (board) shall be\n\nnotified that the offender has violated a municipal ordinance.\n\n    2.   Procedural history.   The plaintiffs, who represent a\n\ncertified class of \"all registered [l]evel [two] and [l]evel\n\n[three] sex offenders who are now or who may in the future be\n\nprohibited from living at various places in the [city] by the\n\ncity's ordinance pertaining to sex offender residency\n\nrestrictions,\" commenced this action after receiving the notices\n\nto move, as authorized under the ordinance.   The city sent\n\nletters notifying each that he lives within a restricted area\n\nunder the ordinance and that he has thirty days from the date of\n\nthe letter \"to relocate to another address which is in\n\ncompliance with the [o]rdinance\" or be subject to a fine of $300\n\f                                                                    7\n\n\nfor each day of residing in a restricted area.8    The plaintiffs\n\nfiled a motion for partial summary judgment on the counts in the\n\ncomplaint asserting that the ordinance (1) violates the Home\n\nRule Amendment; (2) is an ex post facto law under the Federal\n\nand State Constitutions; and (3) violates the plaintiffs' right\n\nto travel under the Massachusetts Constitution.9    The city\n\ndefended the ordinance by arguing, with regard to the Home Rule\n\nAmendment, that the residency restriction is not inconsistent\n\nwith State law, and that the shared purpose -- the protection of\n\nchildren from sexual predators -- supports and supplements the\n\nlaw governing the oversight of sex offenders.\n\n     In a thorough and well-reasoned memorandum of decision, the\n\njudge granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs and\n\ninvalidated the ordinance under the Home Rule Amendment,\n\nconcluding that that \"the totality of the circumstances support\n\n     8\n       The letters state that the city is \"unaware of any\nstatutory exceptions\" that may apply.\n     9\n       During the course of litigation, the parties argued\nrepeatedly over the scope of discovery. The judge limited the\nsubjects allowed in discovery and impounded identification of\nthe plaintiffs' names. The judge also denied the city's motions\nto compel the criminal records and Sex Offender Registry Board\n(board) classification recommendation files for the members of\nthe plaintiff class. Although the city argues that there are\nnumerous material disputes of fact deriving from the limited\ndiscovery, the information that was sought is not relevant to\nthe issue of whether the ordinance violates the Home Rule\nprovisions. See art. 89, ยง 6, of the Amendments to the\nMassachusetts Constitution; G. L. c. 43B, ยง 13.\n\f                                                                     8\n\n\nan express legislative intent to forbid local activity in the\n\narea of the civil regulation and management of the post-\n\nincarceration lives of convicted sex offenders.\"    In particular,\n\nthe judge determined that the ordinance is inconsistent with\n\nG. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178C-178Q, the Sex Offender Registry Law\n\n(registry law); and G. L. c. 123A, the law providing for the\n\n\"Care, Treatment and Rehabilitation of Sexually Dangerous\n\nPersons\" (SDP law).    In light of this disposition, however, the\n\njudge declined to review the remaining constitutional claims.\n\n    Discussion.   The city argues on appeal that the ordinance\n\nwas adopted as a valid exercise of its police power, that there\n\nis no evidence of legislative intent to occupy the field\n\ngoverning the management of postincarceration sex offenders, and\n\nthe ordinance does not conflict with State law.    The plaintiffs\n\ncounter that the judge correctly determined that the ordinance\n\nis unconstitutional and urges this court to affirm the judge on\n\nthe broader constitutional grounds asserted in their motion for\n\npartial summary judgment.   We decline to reach the broader\n\nconstitutional grounds but we agree that the judge properly\n\ninvalidated the ordinance as unconstitutional under the Home\n\nRule Amendment.\n\n    A local regulation is unconstitutional under the Home Rule\n\nAmendment if it is \"inconsistent\" with the constitution or laws\n\nof the Commonwealth.    Connors v. Boston, 430 Mass. 31, 35\n\f                                                                      9\n\n\n(1999).    This principle is derived from the language of the Home\n\nRule Amendment that provides:\n\n          \"Any city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or\n     repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power\n     or function which the general court has power to confer\n     upon it, which is not inconsistent with the constitution or\n     laws enacted by the general court in conformity with powers\n     reserved to the general court by section eight, and which\n     is not denied, either expressly or by clear implication, to\n     the city or town by its charter, whether or not it has\n     adopted a charter pursuant to section three.\"\n\nArt. 89, ยง 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts\n\nConstitution. \"[T]he touchstone of the analysis [of whether a\n\nlocal ordinance is inconsistent with State law] is whether the\n\nState Legislature intended to preempt the city's authority to\n\nact.\"     Connors, supra, citing Bloom v. Worcester, 363 Mass. 136,\n\n155 (1973).    Review of a local ordinance is focused on the\n\nLegislature's preemption prerogative because, as the title\n\nsuggests, the Home Rule Amendment was enacted to restore to\n\nmunicipalities the \"right of self-government in local matters.\"\n\nArt. 89, ยง 1, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts\n\nConstitution.    The genesis of the Home Rule Amendment as a means\n\nto expand municipal legislative authority10 thus informs the\n\n\n     10\n       The Home Rule Amendment was approved by a convention of\nthe House and Senate in 1963 and 1965, and adopted by the voters\nin 1966. Massachusetts Legislative Research Council Report\nRelative to Revising the Municipal Home Rule Amendment, 1971\nSenate Doc. No. 1455, at 58-59. It annulled art. 2 of the\nAmendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, id. at 58, which\nhad established municipalities as \"hierarchical subordinates to\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nanalytical directive that in reviewing a local ordinance, the\n\n\"question is not whether the Legislature intended to grant\n\nauthority to municipalities to act . . . , but rather whether\n\nthe Legislature intended to deny [a municipality] the right to\n\nlegislate on the subject [in question].\"   Wendell v. Attorney\n\nGen., 394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985).   \"Municipalities enjoy\n\n'considerable latitude' in this regard,\" and a local regulation\n\nwill not be invalidated unless the court finds a \"sharp\n\nconflict\" between the local and State provisions.   Easthampton\n\nSav. Bank v. Springfield, 470 Mass. 284, 289 (2014), quoting\n\nBloom, 363 Mass. at 154.   A sharp \"conflict 'appears when either\n\nthe legislative intent to preclude local action is clear, or,\n\nabsent plain expression of such intent, the purpose of the\n\nlegislation cannot be achieved in the face of the local by-\n\nlaw.'\"   Easthampton Sav. Bank, supra, quoting Grace v.\n\nBrookline, 379 Mass. 43, 54 (1979).   Where, as here, the\n\n\n\nthe state Legislature that could only enact local legislation\nafter receiving an affirmative grant of power\" from the\nLegislature. See Jerison, Home Rule in Massachusetts, 67 Mass.\nL. Rev. 51, 51 (1982). Article 89, ยง 1, of the Amendments to\nthe Massachusetts Constitution declared: \"It is the intention\nof this article to reaffirm the customary and traditional\nliberties of the people with respect to the conduct of their\nlocal government, and to grant and confirm to the people of\nevery city and town the right of self-government in local\nmatters, subject to the provisions of this article and to such\nstandards and requirements as the general court may establish by\nlaw in accordance with the provisions of this article.\"\n\f                                                                   11\n\n\nLegislature is silent on the issue of local regulation, we also\n\nmay infer an intent to forbid local regulation if \"legislation\n\non a subject is so comprehensive that an inference would be\n\njustified that the Legislature intended to preempt the field.\"\n\nEasthampton Sav. Bank, supra, quoting    Wendell, 394 Mass. at\n\n524.    The burden is on the challenger to establish that the\n\nlocal enactment is \"inconsistent\" with the Constitution or State\n\nlaw.    Springfield Preservation Trust, Inc. v. Springfield\n\nLibrary & Museums Ass'n, Inc., 447 Mass. 408, 418 (2006), citing\n\nGrace, supra at 49-50.\n\n       We turn now to the application of these principles to the\n\nordinance.    Based on our de novo review of the judge's decision,\n\nTwomey v. Middleborough, 468 Mass. 260, 267 (2014), citing\n\nRitter v. Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., 439 Mass. 214, 215\n\n(2003), we conclude that the ordinance is inconsistent with the\n\ncomprehensive scheme of legislation intended to protect the\n\npublic from convicted sex offenders and, thereby, manifests the\n\n\"sharp conflict\" that renders it unconstitutional under the Home\n\nRule Amendment.    Although the registry law and the other laws\n\ngoverning sex offenders do not expressly prohibit local\n\nregulation, we infer from the comprehensive nature of the\n\nstatutory scheme for oversight of sex offenders and the negative\n\neffect that the ordinance may have on the monitoring and\n\f                                                                      12\n\n\ntracking of sex offenders, that the Legislature intended to\n\npreclude local regulation of sex offender residency options.\n\n    To provide context for our conclusion that the Legislature\n\nintended to preclude further regulation of sex offender\n\nresidence options, we first recapitulate the depth and breadth\n\nof the legislation mandating oversight of sex offenders.       In\n\n1999, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive package of laws\n\nwhich effected a major overhaul of the statutory scheme\n\ngoverning the identification, treatment and postrelease\n\nmanagement of convicted sex offenders.    St. 1999, c. 74.     That\n\npackage of laws, described as \"An Act improving the sex offender\n\nregistry and establishing civil commitment and community parole\n\nsupervision for life for sex offenders,\" includes the registry\n\nlaw, G. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178C-178Q.    St. 1999, c. 74, as amended by\n\nSt. 2003, c. 26, ยง 12.   The stated purpose of the act is to\n\n\"assist local law enforcement agencies' efforts to protect their\n\ncommunities by requiring sex offenders to register and to\n\nauthorize the release of necessary and relevant information\n\nabout certain sex offenders to the public as provided in this\n\nact.\"   St. 1999, c. 74, ยง 1.   It accomplishes that purpose\n\nthrough three primary mechanisms:    (1) compelling sex offenders\n\nto register and maintain current personal information with the\n\nboard and local police, and distributing such information in\n\naccordance with the registry law, G. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178C-178Q,\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\ninserted by St. 1999, C. 74, ยง 2, as amended by St. 2003, c. 26,\n\nยง 12; (2) civilly confining certain offenders deemed most likely\n\nto reoffend, G. L. c. 123A, inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, ยงยง 3-8;\n\nand (3) controlling certain aspects of the postincarceration\n\nlives of certain sex offenders, G. L. c. 127, ยง 133D, inserted\n\nby St. 1999, c. 74, ยง 9 (community parole supervision for life).\n\n    The first mechanism in the 1999 registry law, as amended\n\nthrough St. 2013, c. 63, requires that sex offenders update\n\ntheir registration information annually and when they change\n\nresidences, employment, or schooling; a sex offender who is\n\nhomeless must also update their registration information every\n\nthirty days and wear a global positioning system (GPS) device.\n\nG. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178F, 178F 1/2, 178F 3/4.   The law defines who is\n\nconsidered a \"sex offender\"; creates the board; requires sex\n\noffenders to register with the board; requires the board to\n\ncreate a central computerized registry of sex offender\n\ninformation and transmit that data to the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation and to police departments in the municipalities\n\nwhere the offender intends to live and work; creates a\n\nclassification system for offenders subject to judicial review;\n\nand, after classification, requires sex offenders to maintain\n\ncurrent registration information with local police.   G. L. c. 6,\n\nยงยง 178C, 178D, 178E, 178F, 178F 1/2, 178K, 178L, 178M.   The law\n\ncreates criminal penalties for failing to register and provides\n\f                                                                   14\n\n\na mechanism for terminating the obligation to register.    G. L.\n\nc. 6, ยงยง 178F, 178G, 178H, 178K.\n\n     The registry law further provides guidelines for\n\ndetermining the offender's classification level, which is based\n\non the risk of reoffense and the public safety interest in\n\nmaking registration information available to the public.     See\n\nG. L. c. 6, ยง 178K (2) (a)-(c).    In that regard, the\n\nclassification level assigned to each sex offender depends, in\n\npart, on the amount of personal information deemed necessary for\n\npublic safety and appropriate for public availability.11\n\nRegistration information for level one sex offenders is not\n\nprovided to the public, information for level two and level\n\nthree offenders is available to the public by request or on the\n\nInternet,12 and information for level three offenders may be\n\ndisseminated actively to the public.   G. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178D, 178I,\n\n178J.\n\n\n     11\n        The classification levels are to be determined based on\nthe risk of reoffense, the degree of dangerousness posed to the\npublic, and whether a public safety interest is served by public\navailability of information about the sex offender. G. L. c. 6,\nยง 178K.\n     12\n       Initially, only registration information for level three\nsex offenders was publically available on the Internet. St.\n2003, c. 140, ยง 5. Level two sex offenders were added in 2013.\nSt. 2013, c. 38, ยงยง 7-13. See Moe v. Sex Offender Registry Bd.,\n467 Mass. 598, 616 (2014) (declaring unconstitutional\nretroactive application of amendment regarding level two data).\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\n    This framework demonstrates the legislative priority\n\nattached to monitoring the residence, employment, and schooling\n\nlocations of sex offenders as a means to protect the public from\n\nsex offenders.    That monitoring sex offenders is a priority is\n\ndemonstrated clearly by the Legislature's choice to insert only\n\na narrow residency restriction in the registry law.      That\n\nrestriction only bars level three offenders from residing in\n\nrest homes or similar long-term care facilities.   G. L. c. 6,\n\nยง 178K (2) (e).   Although we concluded in Doe v. Police Comm'r\n\nof Boston, 460 Mass. 342, 343 (2011), that this restriction was\n\nunconstitutional without an individualized hearing to determine\n\nthe risk posed by the petitioner to the vulnerable community\n\nsought to be protected, the restriction is instructive of\n\nlegislative intent.   This provision demonstrates that the\n\nLegislature considered and addressed potential risks involved\n\nwith sex offender residency in relation to a vulnerable\n\npopulation.   We note that the Legislature limited its\n\nrestriction to those offenders seeking to reside in an\n\nintegrated setting with a vulnerable population and did not\n\ninclude those seeking to reside geographically close to a\n\nvulnerable population.   We infer from the details of the rest\n\nhome restriction that the Legislature intended to exercise\n\ncontrol over any sex offender residency requirements at the\n\nState level and that the Legislature may not have considered it\n\f                                                                   16\n\n\nappropriate to create a blanket prohibition on residency.    The\n\nordinance, which restricts all level two and level three sex\n\noffenders from living in ninety-five per cent of the residential\n\nareas of the city, conflicts with the relatively narrow rest\n\nhome restriction created by the Legislature and is thus\n\ninconsistent with State law.\n\n     As a final observation on the legislative choice to define\n\nthe sex offender residency restriction narrowly, we note the\n\ngrave societal and constitutional implications of the de jure\n\nresidential segregation of sex offenders.   Except for the\n\nincarceration of persons under the criminal law and the civil\n\ncommitment of mentally ill or dangerous persons, the days are\n\nlong since past when whole communities of persons, such Native\n\nAmericans and Japanese-Americans may be lawfully banished from\n\nour midst.13   Also, because of the tension between a sex\n\noffender's liberty interest, Doe v. Sex Offender Registry Bd.,\n\n460 Mass. 336, 338 (2011), and the imperatives of public safety,\n\nthe Legislature has demonstrated a concern for careful crafting\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       For later-condemned examples of banishing communities of\npeople in the United States, see Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397\nU.S. 620, 622-627, 630-631 (1970) (early 1800s treaties forcing\nIndian tribes to migrate to new land uninhabited by settlers)\nand Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944) (1940s\nexile of persons of Japanese ancestry from west coast).\n\f                                                                   17\n\n\nof laws in a field fraught with constitutional peril.14    See\n\nOpinion of the Justices, 423 Mass. 1201, 1202-1203 (1996)\n\n(providing guidance from this court in determining\n\nconstitutionality of community notification provisions of\n\nregistry law).   For this reason as well, the Legislature cannot\n\nhave intended to permit local regulation of sex offender\n\nresidency.\n\n     Apart from the conflict with the registry law's narrowly\n\ndefined residency restriction, the ordinance also is\n\ninconsistent with the registry law in that it would undermine\n\nthe effectiveness of the law's classification system.     The\n\nLegislature set forth guidelines to be used by the board in\n\nclassifying sex offenders and included consideration of whether\n\nthe \"sex offender is residing in a home situation that provides\n\nguidance and supervision.\"   G. L. c. 6, 178K (1) (c).    The board\n\n     14\n       Constitutional peril is demonstrated through several\ncases challenging the constitutionality of the sex offender\nstatutes. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Cole, 468 Mass. 294, 296\nn.4, 308 (2014) (community parole supervision for life [CPSL]\nviolates separation of powers provision of Massachusetts\nConstitution); Moe v.

By requiring level two and level\n\nthree sex offenders to move from their residences or face a\n\ncivil penalty of $300 per day, the ordinance disrupts the\n\nstability of the home situations of sex offenders.   As a\n\nsupervised and stable home situation has been recognized as a\n\nfactor that minimizes the sex offender's risk of reoffense,15\n\nthis disruption is inconsistent with the Legislature's goal of\n\nprotecting the public.

L. c. 123A, the Legislature already has provided a\n\nmethod to exclude those sex offenders determined to be most\n\nlikely to reoffend from the general population, even after their\n\nincarceration has been completed.   G. L. c. 123A.   Before a sex\n\noffender is released from incarceration, confinement, or\n\ncommitment (with a limited exception for an offender imprisoned\n\nfor six months or less on a parole violation), a determination\n\nis made whether that offender is likely to be a sexually\n\ndangerous person.   G. L. c. 123A, ยงยง 12-13.   If a judge\n\ndetermines, in accordance with certain procedures and\n\nevidentiary standards, that an offender has been \"convicted of a\n\nsexual offense, suffers from a mental abnormality or personality\n\ndisorder that renders him a menace to the health and safety of\n\nothers, and is likely to engage in sexual offenses if not\n\nconfined,\" the Commonwealth may civilly confine the offender.16\n\nCommonwealth v.

See Fay, supra\n\n     16\n       A committed sex offender may be discharged after a\nhearing if the trier of fact does not find that the person\nremains a sexually dangerous person. G.

Accordingly, the SDP law is the Legislature's\n\nchosen method to control sex offenders where it has been\n\ndetermined that maintaining and distributing the offender's\n\nregistry information is insufficient to protect a community's\n\npublic safety interest.   The SDP law, therefore, further\n\ndemonstrates the intent of the Legislature to focus on\n\nmaintaining and distributing sex offender information as a means\n\nto protect the public for offenders who are not deemed dangerous\n\nenough to confine and the ordinance conflicts with that purpose\n\nby intruding on the controls deemed appropriate by the\n\nLegislature.\n\n     The third mechanism in the 1999 package of laws, the\n\ncommunity parole supervision for life (CPSL) law,17 together with\n\nother parole and probation laws, was intended to allow the\n\nCommonwealth to control sex offenders' postincarceration lives\n\nby requiring certain conditions dependent on the offender's\n\nparticular situation.   See G. L. c. 127, ยงยง 133A (parole), 133D\n\n(CPSL), and 133D 1/2 (parole and CPSL controls); G. L. c. 265,\n\nยง 47 (probation controls).   In addition to discretionary\n\ncontrols that may be assessed, the Legislature mandated that all\n\n\n     17\n       In Commonwealth v. Cole, 468 Mass. 294, 305-306 (2014),\nwe held that the CPSL law, G. L. c. 127, ยง 133D, violated the\nconstitutional mandate of separation of powers.\n\f                                                                  21\n\n\npersons under such controls wear a GPS device and be subject to\n\ncertain geographic exclusion zones, \"in and around the victim's\n\nresidence, place of employment and school and other areas\n\ndefined to minimize the [offender's] contact with children, if\n\napplicable.\"    G. L. c. 127, ยง 133D 1/2.   G. L. c. 265, ยง 47.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Guzman, 469 Mass. 492, 493 (2014) (GPS\n\nmonitoring mandatory where defendant sentenced to probationary\n\nterm for enumerated offense).18   The targeted approach to\n\ncontrolling sex offenders based on their particular circumstance\n\nand the GPS requirements set forth by the Legislature\n\ndemonstrates the intent to encourage sex offender monitoring\n\nwith minimum disruption to the stability of a broad population\n\nof offenders.\n\n     In addition to the three mechanisms contained in the 1999\n\npackage of laws, other laws support the legislative goal of\n\nprotecting communities through monitoring sex offenders and\n\ncontrolling only specific situations most likely to cause harm.\n\nFirst, the various methods used to encourage registration\n\ndemonstrate that maintaining current sex offender information is\n\n     18\n       The city argues that parole and probation statutes may\nnot be considered in our analysis because none of the named\nplaintiffs is subject to the controls contained therein. The\nstatutes, however, are instructive as to the Legislature's\nintent for controlling sex offenders after incarceration and,\ntherefore, are relevant to our analysis even if they do not\naffect the named plaintiffs.\n\f                                                                    22\n\n\na primary goal.   In addition to the criminal penalties contained\n\nin the registry law, G. L. c. 6, ยง 178H, the Legislature\n\nmandates that transient benefits be withheld, G. L. c. 18, ยง 38,\n\nand motor vehicle licenses and registration be suspended, G. L.\n\nc. 90, ยง 22 (j), if a sex offender has not maintained current\n\nregistration information.       The Legislature also has imposed\n\nnarrow restrictions to protect certain vulnerable communities\n\nfrom interaction with sex offenders instead of broadly affecting\n\nhousing options for sex offenders.      General Laws c. 6, ยง 178K\n\n(2) (e), inserted by St. 2006, c. 303, ยง 6, prohibits level\n\nthree sex offenders from living a rest home or other regulated\n                           19\nlong-term care facility.        In addition to this restriction, the\n\nLegislature has limited a sex offender's ability to live with\n\nadopted or foster children, G. L. c. 119, ยง 26A, or to work as a\n\nchild care provider, G. L. c. 15D, ยงยง 7, 8, a school bus\n\noperator, G. L. c. 90, ยงยง 8A, 8A 1/2, or an ice cream truck\n\nvendor, G. L. c. 265, ยง 48.\n\n    Conclusion.

We summarize the undisputed facts as drawn\n\nfrom the summary judgment record.\n\n     1.    The ordinance.   The city adopted an \"Ordinance\n\nPertaining to Sex Offender Residency Restrictions in the [city]\"\n\n(ordinance) on January 12, 2011.     The stated purpose of the\n\nordinance is to \"reduce the potential risk of harm to children\n\nof the community by impacting the ability of registered sex\n\noffenders to be in contact with unsuspecting children in\n\nlocations that are primarily designed for use by, or are\n\nprimarily used by children.\"    Observing that \"[r]egistered sex\n\noffenders continue to reside in close proximity to public and\n\nprivate schools, parks and playgrounds,\" and that \"registered\n\nsex offenders will continue to move to buildings, apartments,\n\ndomiciles or residences in close proximity to schools, parks and\n\nplaygrounds,\" the city council enacted the ordinance to \"add\n\nlocation restrictions to such offenders where the [S]tate law is\n\nsilent.\"   The ordinance imposes broad restrictions, with only\n\nnarrow exceptions, on the ability of level two and level three\n\n\n     4\n       We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by Jacob Wetterling\nResource Center, Association for the Treatment of Sexual\nAbusers, Massachusetts Association for the Treatment of Sexual\nAbusers, Inc., Reform Sex Offender Laws, Inc., and Florida\nAction Committee.\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nregistered sex offenders to reside in the city.5   The ordinance\n\nestablishes the area within 1,000 feet of a school or park as a\n\nresidential exclusion zone for level two and level three sex\n\noffenders, and includes in its description of \"school\" all\n\npublic, private, and church schools, and any other business\n\npermitted as a school.   The ordinance also applies to all\n\ntemporary and permanent residences except a \"residence at a\n\nhospital or other healthcare or medical facility for less than\n\nfourteen consecutive days or fourteen (14) days in the aggregate\n\nduring any calendar year.\"   The geographical and temporal reach\n\nof the ordinance effectively prohibits all level two and level\n\nthree sex offenders from establishing residence, or even\n\nspending the night in a shelter, in ninety-five per cent of the\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The \"Ordinance Pertaining to Sex Offender Residency\nRestrictions in the City of Lynn\" (ordinance) also creates\n\"Child Safety Zones,\" wherein level two and level three sex\noffenders are prohibited from entering a school, park, or\nrecreational facility except in certain circumstances and from\n\"loiter[ing]\" within 1,000 feet of such facilities. The\nparties, however, focused their arguments on the residency\nprovision of the ordinance. The plaintiffs' motion for partial\nsummary judgment sought invalidation of the entire ordinance.\nThe city of Lynn (city) did not present any argument, and the\ncourt entered a judgment declaring that the \"Residency\nOrdinance\" violates the Home Rule Amendment. Thus, we know of\nno compelling reason to uphold any provision of the ordinance in\nlight of the comprehensive State law discussed herein.\nAccordingly, we affirm the grant of partial summary judgment in\nfavor of the plaintiffs, which invalidated the entire ordinance.\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\nresidential properties in Lynn.6   The ordinance would affect, at\n\nleast in some degree, all 212 registered level two and level\n\nthree sex offenders residing in the city, as of April 22, 2014.\n\nA sex offender required by the ordinance to move from his or her\n\nresidence could encounter similar restrictions in attempting to\n\nrelocate to nearby cities and towns.   At least forty\n\nmunicipalities have adopted sex offender residency restrictions.7\n\nThe expansive coverage of the ordinance is mitigated by narrow\n\nexceptions to the residency restrictions applicable to those who\n\n(1) have established, prior to the effective date of the\n\nordinance, a permanent residence within a restricted area by\n\npurchasing real property or by being the lessee of an unexpired\n\nlease or rental agreement; (2) are a \"minor\"; (3) are \"residing\n\n     6\n       We note here the undisputed record evidence that of the\n19,320 real estate parcels zoned as residential, 18,421 are\nlocated within 1,000 feet of a school or park.\n     7\n       According to an affidavit dated February 20, 2014,\nsubmitted as part of the summary judgment record and not\ndisputed by the city, the following list of forty municipalities\nhave enacted residency restrictions on certain sex offenders:\nAshland; Ayer; Barre; Barnstable; Braintree; Charlemont;\nCharlton; Chelsea; Colrain; Dedham; Dudley; Fall River;\nFitchburg; Framingham; Hanover; Hanson; Hopkinton; Hubbardston;\nLeominster; Lynn; Marlborough; Mendon; Natick; Norwood; Oxford;\nPembroke; Revere; Rockland; Shirley; Somerset; Southborough;\nSpencer; Springfield; Swansea; Townsend; Waltham; Warren;\nWebster; West Boylston; and Weymouth. The plaintiffs note that\nthe Attorney General's office has continued to approve similar\nregulations, citing a letter from the Attorney General to North\nReading, sent under G. L. c. 40, ยง 32, which approved North\nReading's residency restriction bylaw on January 20, 2015.\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\nwith a person related by blood or marriage within the first\n\ndegree of kindred\"; or (4) have been residing at a permanent\n\nresidence before the school or park creating the applicable\n\nrestricted area was established.\n\n    Failure to comply with the ordinance results in a penalty\n\nof $300 for each day that a sex offender subject to the\n\nordinance remains in a restricted area thirty days after\n\nreceiving a notice to move from the city, or if such sex\n\noffender moves within the city into a restricted area.\n\nAdditionally, if there is a \"subsequent offense,\" the sex\n\noffender's \"landlord, parole officer and/or probation officer,\n\nand the . . . Sex Offender Registry Board\" (board) shall be\n\nnotified that the offender has violated a municipal ordinance.\n\n    2.   Procedural history.   The plaintiffs, who represent a\n\ncertified class of \"all registered [l]evel [two] and [l]evel\n\n[three] sex offenders who are now or who may in the future be\n\nprohibited from living at various places in the [city] by the\n\ncity's ordinance pertaining to sex offender residency\n\nrestrictions,\" commenced this action after receiving the notices\n\nto move, as authorized under the ordinance.   The city sent\n\nletters notifying each that he lives within a restricted area\n\nunder the ordinance and that he has thirty days from the date of\n\nthe letter \"to relocate to another address which is in\n\ncompliance with the [o]rdinance\" or be subject to a fine of $300\n\f                                                                    7\n\n\nfor each day of residing in a restricted area.8    The plaintiffs\n\nfiled a motion for partial summary judgment on the counts in the\n\ncomplaint asserting that the ordinance (1) violates the Home\n\nRule Amendment; (2) is an ex post facto law under the Federal\n\nand State Constitutions; and (3) violates the plaintiffs' right\n\nto travel under the Massachusetts Constitution.9    The city\n\ndefended the ordinance by arguing, with regard to the Home Rule\n\nAmendment, that the residency restriction is not inconsistent\n\nwith State law, and that the shared purpose -- the protection of\n\nchildren from sexual predators -- supports and supplements the\n\nlaw governing the oversight of sex offenders.\n\n     In a thorough and well-reasoned memorandum of decision, the\n\njudge granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs and\n\ninvalidated the ordinance under the Home Rule Amendment,\n\nconcluding that that \"the totality of the circumstances support\n\n     8\n       The letters state that the city is \"unaware of any\nstatutory exceptions\" that may apply.\n     9\n       During the course of litigation, the parties argued\nrepeatedly over the scope of discovery. The judge limited the\nsubjects allowed in discovery and impounded identification of\nthe plaintiffs' names. The judge also denied the city's motions\nto compel the criminal records and Sex Offender Registry Board\n(board) classification recommendation files for the members of\nthe plaintiff class. Although the city argues that there are\nnumerous material disputes of fact deriving from the limited\ndiscovery, the information that was sought is not relevant to\nthe issue of whether the ordinance violates the Home Rule\nprovisions. See art. 89, ยง 6, of the Amendments to the\nMassachusetts Constitution; G. L. c. 43B, ยง 13.\n\f                                                                     8\n\n\nan express legislative intent to forbid local activity in the\n\narea of the civil regulation and management of the post-\n\nincarceration lives of convicted sex offenders.\"    In particular,\n\nthe judge determined that the ordinance is inconsistent with\n\nG. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178C-178Q, the Sex Offender Registry Law\n\n(registry law); and G. L. c. 123A, the law providing for the\n\n\"Care, Treatment and Rehabilitation of Sexually Dangerous\n\nPersons\" (SDP law).    In light of this disposition, however, the\n\njudge declined to review the remaining constitutional claims.\n\n    Discussion.   The city argues on appeal that the ordinance\n\nwas adopted as a valid exercise of its police power, that there\n\nis no evidence of legislative intent to occupy the field\n\ngoverning the management of postincarceration sex offenders, and\n\nthe ordinance does not conflict with State law.    The plaintiffs\n\ncounter that the judge correctly determined that the ordinance\n\nis unconstitutional and urges this court to affirm the judge on\n\nthe broader constitutional grounds asserted in their motion for\n\npartial summary judgment.   We decline to reach the broader\n\nconstitutional grounds but we agree that the judge properly\n\ninvalidated the ordinance as unconstitutional under the Home\n\nRule Amendment.\n\n    A local regulation is unconstitutional under the Home Rule\n\nAmendment if it is \"inconsistent\" with the constitution or laws\n\nof the Commonwealth.

Although the registry law and the other laws\n\ngoverning sex offenders do not expressly prohibit local\n\nregulation, we infer from the comprehensive nature of the\n\nstatutory scheme for oversight of sex offenders and the negative\n\neffect that the ordinance may have on the monitoring and\n\f                                                                      12\n\n\ntracking of sex offenders, that the Legislature intended to\n\npreclude local regulation of sex offender residency options.\n\n    To provide context for our conclusion that the Legislature\n\nintended to preclude further regulation of sex offender\n\nresidence options, we first recapitulate the depth and breadth\n\nof the legislation mandating oversight of sex offenders.       In\n\n1999, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive package of laws\n\nwhich effected a major overhaul of the statutory scheme\n\ngoverning the identification, treatment and postrelease\n\nmanagement of convicted sex offenders.    St. 1999, c. 74.     That\n\npackage of laws, described as \"An Act improving the sex offender\n\nregistry and establishing civil commitment and community parole\n\nsupervision for life for sex offenders,\" includes the registry\n\nlaw, G. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178C-178Q.    St. 1999, c. 74, as amended by\n\nSt. 2003, c. 26, ยง 12.   The stated purpose of the act is to\n\n\"assist local law enforcement agencies' efforts to protect their\n\ncommunities by requiring sex offenders to register and to\n\nauthorize the release of necessary and relevant information\n\nabout certain sex offenders to the public as provided in this\n\nact.\"   St. 1999, c. 74, ยง 1.   It accomplishes that purpose\n\nthrough three primary mechanisms:    (1) compelling sex offenders\n\nto register and maintain current personal information with the\n\nboard and local police, and distributing such information in\n\naccordance with the registry law, G. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178C-178Q,\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\ninserted by St. 1999, C. 74, ยง 2, as amended by St. 2003, c. 26,\n\nยง 12; (2) civilly confining certain offenders deemed most likely\n\nto reoffend, G. L. c. 123A, inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, ยงยง 3-8;\n\nand (3) controlling certain aspects of the postincarceration\n\nlives of certain sex offenders, G. L. c. 127, ยง 133D, inserted\n\nby St. 1999, c. 74, ยง 9 (community parole supervision for life).\n\n    The first mechanism in the 1999 registry law, as amended\n\nthrough St. 2013, c. 63, requires that sex offenders update\n\ntheir registration information annually and when they change\n\nresidences, employment, or schooling; a sex offender who is\n\nhomeless must also update their registration information every\n\nthirty days and wear a global positioning system (GPS) device.\n\nG. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178F, 178F 1/2, 178F 3/4.   The law defines who is\n\nconsidered a \"sex offender\"; creates the board; requires sex\n\noffenders to register with the board; requires the board to\n\ncreate a central computerized registry of sex offender\n\ninformation and transmit that data to the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation and to police departments in the municipalities\n\nwhere the offender intends to live and work; creates a\n\nclassification system for offenders subject to judicial review;\n\nand, after classification, requires sex offenders to maintain\n\ncurrent registration information with local police.   G. L. c. 6,\n\nยงยง 178C, 178D, 178E, 178F, 178F 1/2, 178K, 178L, 178M.   The law\n\ncreates criminal penalties for failing to register and provides\n\f                                                                   14\n\n\na mechanism for terminating the obligation to register.    G. L.\n\nc. 6, ยงยง 178F, 178G, 178H, 178K.\n\n     The registry law further provides guidelines for\n\ndetermining the offender's classification level, which is based\n\non the risk of reoffense and the public safety interest in\n\nmaking registration information available to the public.     See\n\nG. L. c. 6, ยง 178K (2) (a)-(c).    In that regard, the\n\nclassification level assigned to each sex offender depends, in\n\npart, on the amount of personal information deemed necessary for\n\npublic safety and appropriate for public availability.11\n\nRegistration information for level one sex offenders is not\n\nprovided to the public, information for level two and level\n\nthree offenders is available to the public by request or on the\n\nInternet,12 and information for level three offenders may be\n\ndisseminated actively to the public.   G. L. c. 6, ยงยง 178D, 178I,\n\n178J.\n\n\n     11\n        The classification levels are to be determined based on\nthe risk of reoffense, the degree of dangerousness posed to the\npublic, and whether a public safety interest is served by public\navailability of information about the sex offender. G. L. c. 6,\nยง 178K.\n     12\n       Initially, only registration information for level three\nsex offenders was publically available on the Internet. St.\n2003, c. 140, ยง 5.

That monitoring sex offenders is a priority is\n\ndemonstrated clearly by the Legislature's choice to insert only\n\na narrow residency restriction in the registry law.

This provision demonstrates that the\n\nLegislature considered and addressed potential risks involved\n\nwith sex offender residency in relation to a vulnerable\n\npopulation.   We note that the Legislature limited its\n\nrestriction to those offenders seeking to reside in an\n\nintegrated setting with a vulnerable population and did not\n\ninclude those seeking to reside geographically close to a\n\nvulnerable population.   We infer from the details of the rest\n\nhome restriction that the Legislature intended to exercise\n\ncontrol over any sex offender residency requirements at the\n\nState level and that the Legislature may not have considered it\n\f                                                                   16\n\n\nappropriate to create a blanket prohibition on residency.    The\n\nordinance, which restricts all level two and level three sex\n\noffenders from living in ninety-five per cent of the residential\n\nareas of the city, conflicts with the relatively narrow rest\n\nhome restriction created by the Legislature and is thus\n\ninconsistent with State law.\n\n     As a final observation on the legislative choice to define\n\nthe sex offender residency restriction narrowly, we note the\n\ngrave societal and constitutional implications of the de jure\n\nresidential segregation of sex offenders.   Except for the\n\nincarceration of persons under the criminal law and the civil\n\ncommitment of mentally ill or dangerous persons, the days are\n\nlong since past when whole communities of persons, such Native\n\nAmericans and Japanese-Americans may be lawfully banished from\n\nour midst.13   Also, because of the tension between a sex\n\noffender's liberty interest, Doe v.

Accordingly, the SDP law is the Legislature's\n\nchosen method to control sex offenders where it has been\n\ndetermined that maintaining and distributing the offender's\n\nregistry information is insufficient to protect a community's\n\npublic safety interest.   The SDP law, therefore, further\n\ndemonstrates the intent of the Legislature to focus on\n\nmaintaining and distributing sex offender information as a means\n\nto protect the public for offenders who are not deemed dangerous\n\nenough to confine and the ordinance conflicts with that purpose\n\nby intruding on the controls deemed appropriate by the\n\nLegislature.\n\n     The third mechanism in the 1999 package of laws, the\n\ncommunity parole supervision for life (CPSL) law,17 together with\n\nother parole and probation laws, was intended to allow the\n\nCommonwealth to control sex offenders' postincarceration lives\n\nby requiring certain conditions dependent on the offender's\n\nparticular situation.   See G. L. c. 127, ยงยง 133A (parole), 133D\n\n(CPSL), and 133D 1/2 (parole and CPSL controls); G. L. c. 265,\n\nยง 47 (probation controls).

The\nstatutes, however, are instructive as to the Legislature's\nintent for controlling sex offenders after incarceration and,\ntherefore, are relevant to our analysis even if they do not\naffect the named plaintiffs.\n\f                                                                    22\n\n\na primary goal.   In addition to the criminal penalties contained\n\nin the registry law, G. L. c. 6, ยง 178H, the Legislature\n\nmandates that transient benefits be withheld, G. L. c. 18, ยง 38,\n\nand motor vehicle licenses and registration be suspended, G. L.\n\nc. 90, ยง 22 (j), if a sex offender has not maintained current\n\nregistration information.       The Legislature also has imposed\n\nnarrow restrictions to protect certain vulnerable communities\n\nfrom interaction with sex offenders instead of broadly affecting\n\nhousing options for sex offenders.      General Laws c. 6, ยง 178K\n\n(2) (e), inserted by St. 2006, c. 303, ยง 6, prohibits level\n\nthree sex offenders from living a rest home or other regulated\n                           19\nlong-term care facility.        In addition to this restriction, the\n\nLegislature has limited a sex offender's ability to live with\n\nadopted or foster children, G. L. c. 119, ยง 26A, or to work as a\n\nchild care provider, G. L. c. 15D, ยงยง 7, 8, a school bus\n\noperator, G. L. c. 90, ยงยง 8A, 8A 1/2, or an ice cream truck\n\nvendor, G. L. c. 265, ยง 48.\n\n    Conclusion.
