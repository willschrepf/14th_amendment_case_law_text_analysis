(TAPS) declaratory\n\nrelief and attorney’s fees. In four issues, the Union argues the trial court’s “final judgment” was\n\nsigned after the court’s plenary power expired; the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\nand committed reversible error in denying the Union’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to\n\ndismiss; the trial court erred in granting TAPS’ motion for summary judgment; and the trial court\n\nerred in awarding TAPS $115,578.77 in attorney’s fees. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n       In May 2010, TAPS filed its original petition seeking a declaratory judgment. TAPS\n\nalleged the Union had engaged TAPS in collective bargaining negotiations regarding TAPS’\n\nemployees since March 2010. The petition stated TAPS had advised the Union that TAPS was\n\fforbidden under Texas law from engaging in collective bargaining, and any agreement reached\n\nwould be in violation of the law and deemed void.            The petition sought the following\n\ndeclarations:\n\n       (1) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a rural transit district under the Texas Transportation\n       [sic], is a governmental entity and political subdivision of the State of Texas;\n\n       (2) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a governmental entity and political subdivision of the\n       State of Texas, must comply with Texas law, specifically Chapter 617 of the\n       Texas Government Code;\n\n       (3) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a governmental entity and political subdivision of the\n       State of Texas, may not enter “into a collective bargaining agreement with a labor\n       organization regarding wages, hours, or conditions of employment of public\n       employees” pursuant to § 617.002(a) of the Texas Government Code, and that any\n       contract entered into in violation of same is void under § 617.002(b) as a matter of\n       law;\n\n       (4) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a governmental entity and political subdivision of the\n       State of Texas, cannot be forced to engage in such negotiations as such would be\n       in violation of Texas law.\n\nThe petition also sought an award of reasonable attorney’s fees under section 37.009 of the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act.\n\n       In June 2010, the Union filed with the National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB) a\n\ncharge that TAPS had engaged in unfair labor practices. Specifically, the Union alleged TAPS\n\nhad, “[s]ince on or about May 27, 2010 . . . refused to bargain with” the Union. In response to\n\nthis charge, TAPS filed with the NLRB a letter asserting Texas law explicitly forbids TAPS from\n\nengaging in collective bargaining. Further, TAPS objected to the NLRB asserting jurisdiction\n\nover the matter because a suit regarding the same issues was then pending in state court and had\n\nbeen pending since before the Union’s charge was filed with the NLRB. Thus, TAPS argued,\n\n“the NLRB has no jurisdiction over this matter and must dismiss or, at the very least, abate the\n\nabove-referenced union charge until the state lawsuit has been formally resolved.” In support of\n\nits argument, TAPS cited Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 748-49\n\n\n                                               –2–\n\f(1983), for the proposition that the NLRB “may not halt the prosecution of a state-court lawsuit,\n\nregardless of the plaintiff’s motive, unless the suit lacks a reasonable basis in fact or law.”\n\n       In July 2010, the Union filed an answer containing a general denial and asserting (1)\n\nTAPS’ claims were preempted by federal law, including the National Labor Relations Act; (2) an\n\naction was pending before the NLRB, involving jurisdictional questions; (3) the court lacked\n\npersonal jurisdiction over the Union; (4) TAPS failed to state “a claim cognizable against” the\n\nUnion; and (5) TAPS misstated Dallas Area Rapid Transit v. Amalgamated Transit Union Local\n\nNo. 1338, 273 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. 2008) in that the court in that case did not make a determination\n\nas to whether the prohibition of bargaining applied to DART, but accepted the parties’\n\nacquiescence. The Union also requested an award of attorney’s fees.\n\n       In August 2010, the NLRB issued its ruling dismissing the charge against TAPS because\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to support the alleged violation; the Union appealed this decision.\n\nIn January 2011, TAPS filed a traditional motion for summary judgment in which it discussed\n\nhow the Union had engaged TAPS in collective bargaining in the past before TAPS was made\n\naware of prohibitions under Texas law forbidding such negotiations. TAPS alleged that, after\n\nreceiving notice from legal counsel and after the expiration of all prior contractual agreements,\n\nTAPS advised the Union that TAPS was forbidden from engaging in collective bargaining with a\n\nlabor organization.     The motion alleged the Union was “attempting to force” collective\n\nbargaining, necessitating the lawsuit in state court. TAPS reiterated the declarations it sought in\n\nthe state court proceeding and asserted its entitlement to summary judgment on those claims for\n\ndeclaratory relief. In support of its motion, TAPS similarly renewed its arguments that Chapter\n\n617 of the Texas Government Code prohibited TAPS from collective bargaining.\n\n       As to the Union’s claim that TAPS’ suit was preempted by federal law, TAPS again cited\n\nBill Johnson’s Restaurants for the proposition that the NLRB does not have jurisdiction over any\n\n                                                 –3–\n\fpending state court suit which has a reasonable basis in fact or law. Bill Johnson’s Rests., 461\n\nU.S. at 748-49. Further relying on and quoting Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, at 746-47, TAPS\n\nargued that, “[j]ust as the [NLRB] must refrain from deciding genuinely disputed material fact\n\nissues with respect to a state suit, it likewise must not deprive a litigant of his right to have\n\ngenuine state-law legal questions decided by the state judiciary. [The] NLRB should allow such\n\nissues to be decided by the state tribunals if there is any realistic chance that the plaintiff’s legal\n\ntheory might be adopted.”\n\n       To the extent the Union argued the state court lacked personal jurisdiction over it, TAPS\n\npointed out the Union had not filed a special appearance; had filed an answer and general denial\n\nconstituting a general appearance and subjecting the Union to the jurisdiction of the court for all\n\npurposes; and maintained its offices in Grapevine, Texas, where it was served with notice of the\n\nsuit. On the issue of whether TAPS stated a cognizable claim pursuant to the Texas Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act, TAPS identified the justiciable controversy as whether TAPS, as a statutorily\n\ndefined governmental entity and political subdivision, can be forced to violate Texas law by\n\nengaging in collective bargaining. Finally, TAPS asserted it did not misstate the holding in\n\nDART, 273 S.W.3d at 661-62, where the court held Texas law prohibits a state political\n\nsubdivision from collective bargaining with public employees, and this prohibition has been held\n\nto apply to DART. Id. at 661.\n\n       In February 2011, the NLRB denied the Union’s appeal of the dismissal of the Union’s\n\ncomplaint. In a letter, the NLRB stated TAPS is an exempt political subdivision, and the NLRB\n\ncould not assert jurisdiction over TAPS under section 2(2) of the National Labor Relations Act\n\nproviding an exemption for political subdivisions “to entities that are either: (1) created directly\n\nby the state, so as to constitute departments or administrative arms of the government, or (2)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 –4–\n\fadministered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate,”\n\nciting NLRB v. Natural Gas Utility District of Hawkins County, 402 U.S. 600 (1971).\n\n       Also in February 2011, the Union filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss in\n\nwhich it argued the real dispute between the parties was whether TAPS “is reached by and had a\n\nduty to collectively bargain with” the Union pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act. The\n\nUnion alleged federal law holds that resolution of this issue is committed to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the NLRB and noted the NLRB had ruled in TAPS’ favor on the issue. Thus, the\n\nUnion argued, no justiciable controversy remained for the state court to decide, and the state\n\ncourt was therefore without subject matter jurisdiction over any claim in the lawsuit.\n\n       On February 25, 2011, the trial court conducted a hearing on TAPS’ motion for summary\n\njudgment and the Union’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss. On March 1, 2011, the\n\ntrial court signed an order granting TAPS’ motion for summary judgment, granting each of\n\nTAPS’ claims for declaratory relief, and ordering that TAPS recover its “reasonable fees and\n\ncosts upon proof of same.” The next day, the trial court entered an order denying the Union’s\n\nplea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss.\n\n       In August 2012, TAPS filed a motion for entry of final judgment supported by affidavits\n\nand attorney’s records documenting TAPS’ claim for $115,578.77 in attorney’s fees.               The\n\nmotion also sought a final judgment incorporating the trial court’s prior order granting TAPS’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. In September 2012, the Union filed an amended answer in\n\nwhich it reiterated its prior claims and asserted TAPS’ request for attorney’s fees and costs was\n\nbarred by laches. On October 16, 2012, the trial court sent the parties a letter (1) stating the court\n\nwas of the opinion that TAPS’ motion for entry of judgment and motion to strike the Union’s\n\namended answer should be granted and (2) awarding TAPS $115,578.77 in attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  –5–\n\f       On November 2, 2012, the Union filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw with respect to the trial court’s March 2, 2011 order denying the Union’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction and motion to dismiss and October 16, 2012 letter awarding TAPS attorney’s fees.\n\nThe union asserted that its request for findings of fact and conclusions of law was proper and\n\nnecessary because it appeared the court’s March 1, 2012 order granting TAPS’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment was not a final judgment. Nevertheless, on November 15, 2012, the Union\n\nfiled a notice of appeal from the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order, March 2, 2011 order, and\n\nOctober 16, 2012 letter.\n\n       On November 26, 2012, the trial court signed a final judgment granting TAPS’ motion\n\nfor summary judgment and all of its claims for declaratory relief and awarding TAPS\n\n$115,578.77 in attorney’s fees and costs. Following the signing of the final judgment, the\n\nGrayson County District Clerk sent a “notice of judgment” under seal to each of the parties. On\n\nDecember 13, 2012, the trial court signed a final judgment awarding the same relief as the\n\nNovember 26 judgment and, in addition, awarding attorney’s fees and costs on appeal. This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n       In its first issue, the Union argues the trial court’s combined orders of March 1, 2011 and\n\nMarch 2, 2011, combined with the court’s October 16, 2012 letter, constitute the final judgment\n\nin this case. Thus, the Union argues, the final judgments signed on November 26, 2012 and\n\nDecember 11, 2012 were signed after the trial court’s plenary power expired and are a nullity.\n\n       When there has not been a conventional trial on the merits, an order or judgment is not\n\nfinal for purposes of appeal unless it actually disposes of every pending claim and party or unless\n\nit clearly and unequivocally states that it finally disposes of all claims and all parties. Lehmann\n\nv. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 205 (Tex. 2001).            An order that adjudicates only the\n\nplaintiff’s claims against the defendant does not adjudicate a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third\n\n                                               –6–\n\fparty claim, nor does an order adjudicating claims like the latter dispose of the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nId. An order that disposes of claims by only one of multiple plaintiffs or against one of multiple\n\ndefendants does not adjudicate claims by or against other parties. Id. An order does not dispose\n\nof all claims and all parties merely because it is entitled “final” or because the word “final”\n\nappears elsewhere in the order or even because it awards costs.            Id.   Nor does an order\n\ncompletely dispose of a case merely because it states that it is appealable, since even\n\ninterlocutory orders may sometimes be appealable. Id. Rather, there must be some other clear\n\nindication that the trial court intended the order to completely dispose of the entire case. Id.\n\n       To determine whether an order disposes of all pending claims and parties, it may of\n\ncourse be necessary for the appellate court to look to the record in the case. Id. at 205-06. The\n\nrecord may help illumine whether an order is made final by its own language, so that an order\n\nthat all parties appear to have treated as final may be final despite some vagueness in the order\n\nitself, while an order that some party should not reasonably have regarded as final may not be\n\nfinal despite language that might indicate otherwise. Id. at 206.\n\n       Here, the record shows the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order disposed of only TAPS’\n\nclaims, and the March 2, 2011 order disposed of only the Union’s claims. The issue of TAPS’\n\nattorney’s fees and costs were addressed in the trial court’s October 16, 2012 letter setting an\n\namount of attorney’s fees awarded to TAPS. Not until November 26, 2012 did the trial court\n\nenter a final judgment incorporating its disposition of the claims of all parties and awarding\n\nTAPS its attorney’s fees. The same day, the district clerk sent out notice that a final judgment\n\nhad been entered in the case. We conclude the November 26, 2012 final judgment was the first\n\njudgment that clearly indicated the trial court intended the judgment to completely dispose of the\n\nentire case. See id. at 205. We overrule the Union’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                –7–\n\f       In its second issue, the Union argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and\n\ncommitted reversible error in denying the Union’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss.\n\nSpecifically, the Union argues federal labor law preempts TAPS’ declaratory judgment claim\n\nand no justiciable controversy exists between the parties under Texas law.\n\n       Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. Tex. Dep’t of Parks\n\nand Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004). Appellate courts reviewing a\n\nchallenge to a trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction review the trial court’s ruling de novo. Id.\n\nat 228. A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea, the purpose of which is to defeat a cause of\n\naction without regard to whether the claims asserted have merit. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue,\n\n34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000). The claims may form the context in which a dilatory plea is\n\nraised, but the plea should be decided without delving into the merits of the case. Id. The\n\npurpose of a dilatory plea is not to force the plaintiffs to preview their case on the merits but to\n\nestablish a reason why the merits of the plaintiff’s claims should never be reached. Id.\n\n       To the extent the Union argues the National Labor Relations Act preempts TAPS’ claims,\n\nwe note the Act excludes from its definition of “employer” any “State or political subdivision\n\nthereof.” 29 U.S.C. § 152(2) (2010). The NLRB itself stated TAPS is an exempt political\n\nsubdivision, and the NLRB could not assert jurisdiction over TAPS under section 2(2) of the\n\nNational Labor Relations Act. The Union also refers to a 13(c) arrangement between the parties\n\nthat, together with the NLRB ruling in this case, disposed of all the issues between the parties.\n\nSection 13(c) of the federal Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 (the “UMTA”, now the Federal\n\nTransit Act) conditions a public transportation authority’s receipt of federal financial assistance\n\non “arrangements the Secretary of Labor concludes are fair and equitable” to protect “the\n\ninterests of employees affected by the assistance.” DART v. Amalgamated Transit Union, 273\n\nS.W.3d 659, 660 (Tex. 2008).        Such arrangements “shall include provisions that may be\n\n                                                –8–\n\fnecessary for . . . the preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits . . . [and] the protection of\n\nindividual employees against a worsening of their positions related to employment.” Id. In\n\nDART, DART and its employees’ union operated under a 13(c) arrangement. Id. The court, in\n\nholding 13(c) did not preempt DART’s immunity from suit under state law, noted that Texas law\n\nprohibits a state political subdivision from collective bargaining with public employees. Id. at\n\n661 (citing TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 617.002(a), (b) (West 2012)). The union in DART did not\n\nchallenge the applicability of section 617.002. Id. Thus, DART stands for the proposition that a\n\n13(c) arrangement does not preempt the applicability of section 617.002. See id. at 660-61.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude TAPS’ declaratory judgment claim was not preempted\n\nunder federal labor law.\n\n       To the extent the Union argues no justiciable controversy exists in this case, we disagree.\n\nTAPS sought a declaratory judgment establishing the applicability and effect of section 617.002\n\nof the government code. The Union filed a general denial. A general denial of matters pleaded\n\nby the adverse party which are not required to be denied under oath, shall be sufficient to put the\n\nsame in issue. TEX. R. CIV. P. 92. Further, the Union sought its own attorney’s fees and costs,\n\nwhich amounted to a claim for affirmative relief. Falls Cnty. v. Perkins and Cullum, 798 S.W.2d\n\n868, 871 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1990, no writ) (request for attorney’s fees in declaratory\n\njudgment action is claim for affirmative relief). We conclude a justiciable controversy exists\n\nbetween the parties in this case. The trial court did not err in denying the Union’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction and motion to dismiss. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. We overrule the Union’s\n\nsecond issue.\n\n       In its third issue, the Union argues the trial court erred in granting TAPS’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Specifically, the Union reiterates its arguments that TAPS’ declaratory\n\njudgment action is preempted by federal labor law and there is no evidence of a live, justiciable\n\n                                                 –9–\n\fcontroversy between the parties. We have considered and rejected these arguments, and we need\n\nnot address them further.\n\n       As an additional ground for denying TAPS’ motion for summary judgment, the Union\n\nrelies on the affidavit of Richard Hanna, the Union’s vice president. The Union argues Hanna’s\n\naffidavit “is sufficient to create a triable fact issue as to whether a live, justiciable controversy\n\nexists under Texas law that precludes summary judgment in favor of TAPS.”\n\n       The standard for reviewing a traditional summary judgment is well established. See\n\nNixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49. The movant has the burden of showing\n\nthat no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). In deciding whether a disputed material fact issue exists precluding\n\nsummary judgment, evidence favorable to the nonmovant will be taken as true. Nixon, 690\n\nS.W.2d at 549. Every reasonable inference must be indulged in favor of the nonmovant and any\n\ndoubts resolved in its favor. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 824 (Tex. 2005). We\n\nreview a summary judgment de novo to determine whether a party’s right to prevail is\n\nestablished as a matter of law. Dickey v. Club Corp., 12 S.W.3d 172, 175 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2000, pet. denied).\n\n       The Union argues Hanna’s affidavit raises a fact issue as to the existence of a justiciable\n\ncontroversy. The affidavit states that TAPS and the Union had engaged in collective bargaining\n\nbetween 1998 and 2010. Hanna states this collective bargaining was “pursuant to the NLRA”\n\nand the Union “has never demanded that TAPS collectively bargain with it pursuant to Texas\n\nlaw and the union leadership has never expressed a formal opinion to TAPS or its representatives\n\nabout what Texas law has to say regarding collective bargaining.” Hanna’s affidavit describes\n\nthe Union’s attempt to continue collective bargaining under the NLRA, TAPS’ filing of the\n\nunderlying suit, the Union’s filing of a charge “with the NLRA [sic],” and the NLRB’S\n\n                                               –10–\n\fdetermination that TAPS was exempt from the NLRA. The affidavit states the Union “has not\n\nmade any new or additional demands upon TAPS to collectively bargain since the NLRB issued\n\nits final decision that TAPS is exempt from the reach of the NLRA.” Finally, the affidavit states\n\nthe Union “has made no decision as to what action, if any, it will undertake in the future relative\n\nto the relationship between it and TAPS.”\n\n       At best, Hanna’s affidavit establishes the Union sought no collective bargaining with\n\nTAPS during the pendency of the underlying suit. The affidavit leaves uncertain what action the\n\nUnion might take in the future regarding collective bargaining. The purpose of declaratory\n\njudgments is to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights,\n\nstatus, and other legal relations; and it is to be liberally construed and administered. See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.002(b) (West 2015). We conclude the trial court did not err\n\nin granting summary judgment on TAPS’ request for declaratory relief. See id.; Nixon, 690\n\nS.W.2d at 548-49. We overrule the Union’s third issue.\n\n       In its fourth issue, the Union argues the trial court erred in awarding TAPS $115,578.77\n\nin attorney’s fees and in granting TAPS’ motion to strike the Union’s affirmative defense of\n\nLaches in connection with the attorney’s fees award.\n\n       The declaratory judgments act entrusts attorney fee awards to the trial court’s sound\n\ndiscretion, subject to the requirements that any fees awarded be reasonable and necessary, which\n\nare matters of fact, and to the additional requirements that fees be equitable and just, which are\n\nmatters of law. Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998). It is an abuse of discretion\n\nfor a trial court to rule arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without regard to guiding legal principles or\n\nto rule without supporting evidence. Id. Therefore, in reviewing an attorney’s fee award under\n\nthe Act, the court of appeals must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding fees when there was insufficient evidence that the fees were reasonable and necessary,\n\n                                               –11–\n\for when the award was inequitable or unjust. Id. Unreasonable fees cannot be awarded, even if\n\nthe court believed them just, but the court may conclude that it is not equitable or just to award\n\neven reasonable and necessary fees. Id.\n\n       In part, the Union attacks the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees by arguing the trial\n\ncourt erroneously failed to file findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Union was harmed by\n\nthis failure, and there is no presumption or implied findings to support the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees. Under a discretionary statute, findings of fact and conclusions of law are neither\n\nappropriate nor required. Keever v. Finlan, 988 S.W.2d 300, 306 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1999, pet.\n\ndism’d).   Because TAPS sought attorney’s fees under a statute that makes the award of\n\nattorney’s fees discretionary, the trial court was not required to file findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. See id.\n\n       The Union also challenges the attorney’s fees award on the basis that TAPS’ summary\n\njudgment motion “presented no specific arguments, analysis or evidence . . . as to any of the\n\nrequired four limiting factors announced in Bocquet.” See Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21 (attorney’s\n\nfee award under declaratory judgment act must be reasonable and necessary and equitable and\n\njust). The Union argues the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order granting TAPS’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment and granting TAPS its “reasonable fees and costs upon proof of same” is\n\n“arbitrary, unreasonable, made without regard to guiding legal principles, and is without\n\nsupporting evidence.” In making this argument, the Union disregards the evidence of reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees presented in TAPS’ August 2012 motion for entry of final\n\njudgment and at the hearing on that motion. We have previously discussed the incomplete nature\n\nof the relief afforded by the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order. We decline to hold that the trial\n\ncourt’s express deferral of a determination of attorney’s fees based on proof to be adduced at a\n\nlater date rendered that award unsupportable because no evidence supported it.\n\n                                              –12–\n\f       The Union argues further that the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees was not equitable\n\nand just and the fees were not reasonable and necessary. There are several factors a trial court\n\nshould consider in determining the amount of reasonable attorney’s fees to award. Jarvis v.\n\nRocanville Corp., 298 S.W.3d 305, 318 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied). These factors\n\ninclude: the time, labor, and skill required to properly perform the legal service; the novelty and\n\ndifficulty of the questions involved; the customary fees charged in the local legal community for\n\nsimilar legal services; the amount involved and the results obtained; the nature and length of the\n\nprofessional relationship with the client; and the experience, reputation and ability of the lawyer\n\nperforming the services. Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818\n\n(Tex. 1997); Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 318. But a trial court is not required to receive evidence on\n\neach of these factors. Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 318.\n\n       The record contains the affidavits of one of TAPS’ attorneys and the executive director of\n\nthe attorney’s law firm stating the specific challenges presented by this case and specifying\n\n$115,578.77 was a reasonable and necessary fee. The trial judge also conducted a hearing at\n\nwhich he heard evidence concerning the attorney’s fees issue. Further, TAPS attached to its\n\nmotion for entry of final judgment extensive billing records supporting the amount of fees it\n\nsought. The Union relies on the affidavit of its attorney in which he states the fees TAPS sought\n\nwere not reasonable and necessary.       The affidavit cites the factors outlined above and, as\n\n“reasons” that the fees are not reasonable and necessary, lists six items including (1) failure to\n\nexercise billing judgment, (2) inclusion of billing/costs for motions and/or discovery never filed\n\nor served, (3) failure to describe services and costs with sufficient particularity, (4) billing for\n\nservices and costs arising out of the federal administrative proceedings, (5) failure to segregate\n\nbilling and costs declaratory judgment claims from other claims, and (6) billing for services and\n\ncosts beyond the preparation of/attendance at items as reflected on the trial court’s docket sheet,\n\n                                               –13–\n\fa copy of which was attached. We conclude that, because these “reasons” did not provide\n\nunderlying facts to support the conclusion that the attorney’s fees were unreasonable, the\n\naffidavit was conclusory and therefore did not raise a fact issue on the question of the\n\nreasonableness of the requested attorney’s fees. See Brownlee v. Brownlee, 665 S.W.2d 111, 112\n\n(Tex. 1984). Further, having reviewed the record, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in making its award of attorney’s fees. See Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21.\n\n       Regarding the Union’s complaint that the trial court erred in granting TAPS’ motion to\n\nstrike its amended answer, rule 166a(c) provides that the trial court should render summary\n\njudgment based on the pleadings on file at the time of the hearing. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\nOnce the hearing date on the motion for summary judgment has passed, but before the court\n\nsigns a judgment, a party must obtain a written order from the trial court granting permission to\n\nfile an amended pleading. Prater v. State Farm Lloyds, 217 S.W.3d 739, 741 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2007, no pet.). Here, on February 25, 2011, the trial court conducted a hearing on TAPS’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. The Union filed its amended motion adding the defense of\n\nlaches in September 2012. The Union did not seek or obtain a written order from the trial court\n\ngranting permission to file an amended pleading. We therefore conclude the trial did not err in\n\ngranting TAPS’ motion to strike the Union’s amended pleading. Id. We overrule the Union’s\n\nfourth issue.\n\n       We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n121556F.P05\n                                                  /David L.

(TAPS) declaratory\n\nrelief and attorney’s fees. In four issues, the Union argues the trial court’s “final judgment” was\n\nsigned after the court’s plenary power expired; the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\nand committed reversible error in denying the Union’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to\n\ndismiss; the trial court erred in granting TAPS’ motion for summary judgment; and the trial court\n\nerred in awarding TAPS $115,578.77 in attorney’s fees. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n       In May 2010, TAPS filed its original petition seeking a declaratory judgment. TAPS\n\nalleged the Union had engaged TAPS in collective bargaining negotiations regarding TAPS’\n\nemployees since March 2010. The petition stated TAPS had advised the Union that TAPS was\n\fforbidden under Texas law from engaging in collective bargaining, and any agreement reached\n\nwould be in violation of the law and deemed void.            The petition sought the following\n\ndeclarations:\n\n       (1) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a rural transit district under the Texas Transportation\n       [sic], is a governmental entity and political subdivision of the State of Texas;\n\n       (2) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a governmental entity and political subdivision of the\n       State of Texas, must comply with Texas law, specifically Chapter 617 of the\n       Texas Government Code;\n\n       (3) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a governmental entity and political subdivision of the\n       State of Texas, may not enter “into a collective bargaining agreement with a labor\n       organization regarding wages, hours, or conditions of employment of public\n       employees” pursuant to § 617.002(a) of the Texas Government Code, and that any\n       contract entered into in violation of same is void under § 617.002(b) as a matter of\n       law;\n\n       (4) that Plaintiff TAPS, as a governmental entity and political subdivision of the\n       State of Texas, cannot be forced to engage in such negotiations as such would be\n       in violation of Texas law.\n\nThe petition also sought an award of reasonable attorney’s fees under section 37.009 of the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act.\n\n       In June 2010, the Union filed with the National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB) a\n\ncharge that TAPS had engaged in unfair labor practices. Specifically, the Union alleged TAPS\n\nhad, “[s]ince on or about May 27, 2010 . . . refused to bargain with” the Union. In response to\n\nthis charge, TAPS filed with the NLRB a letter asserting Texas law explicitly forbids TAPS from\n\nengaging in collective bargaining. Further, TAPS objected to the NLRB asserting jurisdiction\n\nover the matter because a suit regarding the same issues was then pending in state court and had\n\nbeen pending since before the Union’s charge was filed with the NLRB. Thus, TAPS argued,\n\n“the NLRB has no jurisdiction over this matter and must dismiss or, at the very least, abate the\n\nabove-referenced union charge until the state lawsuit has been formally resolved.” In support of\n\nits argument, TAPS cited Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110943\"><a href=\"/opinion/110943/bill-johnsons-restaurants-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 748-49\n\n\n                                               –2–\n\f(1983), for the proposition that the NLRB “may not halt the prosecution of a state-court lawsuit,\n\nregardless of the plaintiff’s motive, unless the suit lacks a reasonable basis in fact or law.”\n\n       In July 2010, the Union filed an answer containing a general denial and asserting (1)\n\nTAPS’ claims were preempted by federal law, including the National Labor Relations Act; (2) an\n\naction was pending before the NLRB, involving jurisdictional questions; (3) the court lacked\n\npersonal jurisdiction over the Union; (4) TAPS failed to state “a claim cognizable against” the\n\nUnion; and (5) TAPS misstated Dallas Area Rapid Transit v. Amalgamated Transit Union Local\n\nNo. 1338, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895075\"><a href=\"/opinion/895075/dart-area-rapid-transit-v-amalgamated-transit-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2008) in that the court in that case did not make a determination\n\nas to whether the prohibition of bargaining applied to DART, but accepted the parties’\n\nacquiescence. The Union also requested an award of attorney’s fees.\n\n       In August 2010, the NLRB issued its ruling dismissing the charge against TAPS because\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to support the alleged violation; the Union appealed this decision.\n\nIn January 2011, TAPS filed a traditional motion for summary judgment in which it discussed\n\nhow the Union had engaged TAPS in collective bargaining in the past before TAPS was made\n\naware of prohibitions under Texas law forbidding such negotiations. TAPS alleged that, after\n\nreceiving notice from legal counsel and after the expiration of all prior contractual agreements,\n\nTAPS advised the Union that TAPS was forbidden from engaging in collective bargaining with a\n\nlabor organization.     The motion alleged the Union was “attempting to force” collective\n\nbargaining, necessitating the lawsuit in state court. TAPS reiterated the declarations it sought in\n\nthe state court proceeding and asserted its entitlement to summary judgment on those claims for\n\ndeclaratory relief. In support of its motion, TAPS similarly renewed its arguments that Chapter\n\n617 of the Texas Government Code prohibited TAPS from collective bargaining.\n\n       As to the Union’s claim that TAPS’ suit was preempted by federal law, TAPS again cited\n\nBill Johnson’s Restaurants for the proposition that the NLRB does not have jurisdiction over any\n\n                                                 –3–\n\fpending state court suit which has a reasonable basis in fact or law. Bill Johnson’s Rests., 461\n\nU.S. at 748-49. Further relying on and quoting Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, at 746-47, TAPS\n\nargued that, “[j]ust as the [NLRB] must refrain from deciding genuinely disputed material fact\n\nissues with respect to a state suit, it likewise must not deprive a litigant of his right to have\n\ngenuine state-law legal questions decided by the state judiciary. [The] NLRB should allow such\n\nissues to be decided by the state tribunals if there is any realistic chance that the plaintiff’s legal\n\ntheory might be adopted.”\n\n       To the extent the Union argued the state court lacked personal jurisdiction over it, TAPS\n\npointed out the Union had not filed a special appearance; had filed an answer and general denial\n\nconstituting a general appearance and subjecting the Union to the jurisdiction of the court for all\n\npurposes; and maintained its offices in Grapevine, Texas, where it was served with notice of the\n\nsuit. On the issue of whether TAPS stated a cognizable claim pursuant to the Texas Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act, TAPS identified the justiciable controversy as whether TAPS, as a statutorily\n\ndefined governmental entity and political subdivision, can be forced to violate Texas law by\n\nengaging in collective bargaining. Finally, TAPS asserted it did not misstate the holding in\n\nDART, 273 S.W.3d at 661-62, where the court held Texas law prohibits a state political\n\nsubdivision from collective bargaining with public employees, and this prohibition has been held\n\nto apply to DART. Id. at 661.\n\n       In February 2011, the NLRB denied the Union’s appeal of the dismissal of the Union’s\n\ncomplaint. In a letter, the NLRB stated TAPS is an exempt political subdivision, and the NLRB\n\ncould not assert jurisdiction over TAPS under section 2(2) of the National Labor Relations Act\n\nproviding an exemption for political subdivisions “to entities that are either: (1) created directly\n\nby the state, so as to constitute departments or administrative arms of the government, or (2)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 –4–\n\fadministered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate,”\n\nciting NLRB v. Natural Gas Utility District of Hawkins County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108347\"><a href=\"/opinion/108347/nlrb-v-natural-gas-util-dist-of-hawkins-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971).\n\n       Also in February 2011, the Union filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss in\n\nwhich it argued the real dispute between the parties was whether TAPS “is reached by and had a\n\nduty to collectively bargain with” the Union pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act. The\n\nUnion alleged federal law holds that resolution of this issue is committed to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the NLRB and noted the NLRB had ruled in TAPS’ favor on the issue. Thus, the\n\nUnion argued, no justiciable controversy remained for the state court to decide, and the state\n\ncourt was therefore without subject matter jurisdiction over any claim in the lawsuit.\n\n       On February 25, 2011, the trial court conducted a hearing on TAPS’ motion for summary\n\njudgment and the Union’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss. On March 1, 2011, the\n\ntrial court signed an order granting TAPS’ motion for summary judgment, granting each of\n\nTAPS’ claims for declaratory relief, and ordering that TAPS recover its “reasonable fees and\n\ncosts upon proof of same.” The next day, the trial court entered an order denying the Union’s\n\nplea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss.\n\n       In August 2012, TAPS filed a motion for entry of final judgment supported by affidavits\n\nand attorney’s records documenting TAPS’ claim for $115,578.77 in attorney’s fees.               The\n\nmotion also sought a final judgment incorporating the trial court’s prior order granting TAPS’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. In September 2012, the Union filed an amended answer in\n\nwhich it reiterated its prior claims and asserted TAPS’ request for attorney’s fees and costs was\n\nbarred by laches. On October 16, 2012, the trial court sent the parties a letter (1) stating the court\n\nwas of the opinion that TAPS’ motion for entry of judgment and motion to strike the Union’s\n\namended answer should be granted and (2) awarding TAPS $115,578.77 in attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  –5–\n\f       On November 2, 2012, the Union filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw with respect to the trial court’s March 2, 2011 order denying the Union’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction and motion to dismiss and October 16, 2012 letter awarding TAPS attorney’s fees.\n\nThe union asserted that its request for findings of fact and conclusions of law was proper and\n\nnecessary because it appeared the court’s March 1, 2012 order granting TAPS’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment was not a final judgment. Nevertheless, on November 15, 2012, the Union\n\nfiled a notice of appeal from the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order, March 2, 2011 order, and\n\nOctober 16, 2012 letter.\n\n       On November 26, 2012, the trial court signed a final judgment granting TAPS’ motion\n\nfor summary judgment and all of its claims for declaratory relief and awarding TAPS\n\n$115,578.77 in attorney’s fees and costs. Following the signing of the final judgment, the\n\nGrayson County District Clerk sent a “notice of judgment” under seal to each of the parties. On\n\nDecember 13, 2012, the trial court signed a final judgment awarding the same relief as the\n\nNovember 26 judgment and, in addition, awarding attorney’s fees and costs on appeal. This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n       In its first issue, the Union argues the trial court’s combined orders of March 1, 2011 and\n\nMarch 2, 2011, combined with the court’s October 16, 2012 letter, constitute the final judgment\n\nin this case. Thus, the Union argues, the final judgments signed on November 26, 2012 and\n\nDecember 11, 2012 were signed after the trial court’s plenary power expired and are a nullity.\n\n       When there has not been a conventional trial on the merits, an order or judgment is not\n\nfinal for purposes of appeal unless it actually disposes of every pending claim and party or unless\n\nit clearly and unequivocally states that it finally disposes of all claims and all parties.

The\n\nrecord may help illumine whether an order is made final by its own language, so that an order\n\nthat all parties appear to have treated as final may be final despite some vagueness in the order\n\nitself, while an order that some party should not reasonably have regarded as final may not be\n\nfinal despite language that might indicate otherwise. Id. at 206.\n\n       Here, the record shows the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order disposed of only TAPS’\n\nclaims, and the March 2, 2011 order disposed of only the Union’s claims. The issue of TAPS’\n\nattorney’s fees and costs were addressed in the trial court’s October 16, 2012 letter setting an\n\namount of attorney’s fees awarded to TAPS. Not until November 26, 2012 did the trial court\n\nenter a final judgment incorporating its disposition of the claims of all parties and awarding\n\nTAPS its attorney’s fees. The same day, the district clerk sent out notice that a final judgment\n\nhad been entered in the case. We conclude the November 26, 2012 final judgment was the first\n\njudgment that clearly indicated the trial court intended the judgment to completely dispose of the\n\nentire case. See id. at 205. We overrule the Union’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                –7–\n\f       In its second issue, the Union argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and\n\ncommitted reversible error in denying the Union’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss.\n\nSpecifically, the Union argues federal labor law preempts TAPS’ declaratory judgment claim\n\nand no justiciable controversy exists between the parties under Texas law.\n\n       Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law.

The claims may form the context in which a dilatory plea is\n\nraised, but the plea should be decided without delving into the merits of the case. Id.

Id.\n\n       To the extent the Union argues the National Labor Relations Act preempts TAPS’ claims,\n\nwe note the Act excludes from its definition of “employer” any “State or political subdivision\n\nthereof.” 29 U.S.C. § 152(2) (2010). The NLRB itself stated TAPS is an exempt political\n\nsubdivision, and the NLRB could not assert jurisdiction over TAPS under section 2(2) of the\n\nNational Labor Relations Act. The Union also refers to a 13(c) arrangement between the parties\n\nthat, together with the NLRB ruling in this case, disposed of all the issues between the parties.\n\nSection 13(c) of the federal Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 (the “UMTA”, now the Federal\n\nTransit Act) conditions a public transportation authority’s receipt of federal financial assistance\n\non “arrangements the Secretary of Labor concludes are fair and equitable” to protect “the\n\ninterests of employees affected by the assistance.” DART v.

Such arrangements “shall include provisions that may be\n\n                                                –8–\n\fnecessary for . . . the preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits . . . [and] the protection of\n\nindividual employees against a worsening of their positions related to employment.” Id. In\n\nDART, DART and its employees’ union operated under a 13(c) arrangement. Id. The court, in\n\nholding 13(c) did not preempt DART’s immunity from suit under state law, noted that Texas law\n\nprohibits a state political subdivision from collective bargaining with public employees. Id. at\n\n661 (citing TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 617.002(a), (b) (West 2012)). The union in DART did not\n\nchallenge the applicability of section 617.002. Id. Thus, DART stands for the proposition that a\n\n13(c) arrangement does not preempt the applicability of section 617.002. See id. at 660-61.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude TAPS’ declaratory judgment claim was not preempted\n\nunder federal labor law.\n\n       To the extent the Union argues no justiciable controversy exists in this case, we disagree.\n\nTAPS sought a declaratory judgment establishing the applicability and effect of section 617.002\n\nof the government code.

We conclude a justiciable controversy exists\n\nbetween the parties in this case. The trial court did not err in denying the Union’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction and motion to dismiss. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. We overrule the Union’s\n\nsecond issue.\n\n       In its third issue, the Union argues the trial court erred in granting TAPS’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment.

We have considered and rejected these arguments, and we need\n\nnot address them further.\n\n       As an additional ground for denying TAPS’ motion for summary judgment, the Union\n\nrelies on the affidavit of Richard Hanna, the Union’s vice president. The Union argues Hanna’s\n\naffidavit “is sufficient to create a triable fact issue as to whether a live, justiciable controversy\n\nexists under Texas law that precludes summary judgment in favor of TAPS.”\n\n       The standard for reviewing a traditional summary judgment is well established.

App.—Dallas\n\n2000, pet. denied).\n\n       The Union argues Hanna’s affidavit raises a fact issue as to the existence of a justiciable\n\ncontroversy. The affidavit states that TAPS and the Union had engaged in collective bargaining\n\nbetween 1998 and 2010. Hanna states this collective bargaining was “pursuant to the NLRA”\n\nand the Union “has never demanded that TAPS collectively bargain with it pursuant to Texas\n\nlaw and the union leadership has never expressed a formal opinion to TAPS or its representatives\n\nabout what Texas law has to say regarding collective bargaining.” Hanna’s affidavit describes\n\nthe Union’s attempt to continue collective bargaining under the NLRA, TAPS’ filing of the\n\nunderlying suit, the Union’s filing of a charge “with the NLRA [sic],” and the NLRB’S\n\n                                               –10–\n\fdetermination that TAPS was exempt from the NLRA. The affidavit states the Union “has not\n\nmade any new or additional demands upon TAPS to collectively bargain since the NLRB issued\n\nits final decision that TAPS is exempt from the reach of the NLRA.” Finally, the affidavit states\n\nthe Union “has made no decision as to what action, if any, it will undertake in the future relative\n\nto the relationship between it and TAPS.”\n\n       At best, Hanna’s affidavit establishes the Union sought no collective bargaining with\n\nTAPS during the pendency of the underlying suit. The affidavit leaves uncertain what action the\n\nUnion might take in the future regarding collective bargaining. The purpose of declaratory\n\njudgments is to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights,\n\nstatus, and other legal relations; and it is to be liberally construed and administered. See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.002(b) (West 2015). We conclude the trial court did not err\n\nin granting summary judgment on TAPS’ request for declaratory relief. See id.; Nixon, 690\n\nS.W.2d at 548-49. We overrule the Union’s third issue.\n\n       In its fourth issue, the Union argues the trial court erred in awarding TAPS $115,578.77\n\nin attorney’s fees and in granting TAPS’ motion to strike the Union’s affirmative defense of\n\nLaches in connection with the attorney’s fees award.\n\n       The declaratory judgments act entrusts attorney fee awards to the trial court’s sound\n\ndiscretion, subject to the requirements that any fees awarded be reasonable and necessary, which\n\nare matters of fact, and to the additional requirements that fees be equitable and just, which are\n\nmatters of law. Bocquet v. Herring, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441412\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441412/bocquet-v-herring/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (Tex. 1998). It is an abuse of discretion\n\nfor a trial court to rule arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without regard to guiding legal principles or\n\nto rule without supporting evidence. Id. Therefore, in reviewing an attorney’s fee award under\n\nthe Act, the court of appeals must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding fees when there was insufficient evidence that the fees were reasonable and necessary,\n\n                                               –11–\n\for when the award was inequitable or unjust. Id. Unreasonable fees cannot be awarded, even if\n\nthe court believed them just, but the court may conclude that it is not equitable or just to award\n\neven reasonable and necessary fees. Id.\n\n       In part, the Union attacks the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees by arguing the trial\n\ncourt erroneously failed to file findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Union was harmed by\n\nthis failure, and there is no presumption or implied findings to support the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees. Under a discretionary statute, findings of fact and conclusions of law are neither\n\nappropriate nor required. Keever v. Finlan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2424942\"><a href=\"/opinion/2424942/keever-v-finlan/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1999, pet.\n\ndism’d).   Because TAPS sought attorney’s fees under a statute that makes the award of\n\nattorney’s fees discretionary, the trial court was not required to file findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. See id.\n\n       The Union also challenges the attorney’s fees award on the basis that TAPS’ summary\n\njudgment motion “presented no specific arguments, analysis or evidence . . . as to any of the\n\nrequired four limiting factors announced in Bocquet.” See Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21 (attorney’s\n\nfee award under declaratory judgment act must be reasonable and necessary and equitable and\n\njust). The Union argues the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order granting TAPS’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment and granting TAPS its “reasonable fees and costs upon proof of same” is\n\n“arbitrary, unreasonable, made without regard to guiding legal principles, and is without\n\nsupporting evidence.” In making this argument, the Union disregards the evidence of reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees presented in TAPS’ August 2012 motion for entry of final\n\njudgment and at the hearing on that motion. We have previously discussed the incomplete nature\n\nof the relief afforded by the trial court’s March 1, 2011 order. We decline to hold that the trial\n\ncourt’s express deferral of a determination of attorney’s fees based on proof to be adduced at a\n\nlater date rendered that award unsupportable because no evidence supported it.\n\n                                              –12–\n\f       The Union argues further that the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees was not equitable\n\nand just and the fees were not reasonable and necessary. There are several factors a trial court\n\nshould consider in determining the amount of reasonable attorney’s fees to award.

These factors\n\ninclude: the time, labor, and skill required to properly perform the legal service; the novelty and\n\ndifficulty of the questions involved; the customary fees charged in the local legal community for\n\nsimilar legal services; the amount involved and the results obtained; the nature and length of the\n\nprofessional relationship with the client; and the experience, reputation and ability of the lawyer\n\nperforming the services.

But a trial court is not required to receive evidence on\n\neach of these factors. Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 318.\n\n       The record contains the affidavits of one of TAPS’ attorneys and the executive director of\n\nthe attorney’s law firm stating the specific challenges presented by this case and specifying\n\n$115,578.77 was a reasonable and necessary fee. The trial judge also conducted a hearing at\n\nwhich he heard evidence concerning the attorney’s fees issue. Further, TAPS attached to its\n\nmotion for entry of final judgment extensive billing records supporting the amount of fees it\n\nsought. The Union relies on the affidavit of its attorney in which he states the fees TAPS sought\n\nwere not reasonable and necessary.       The affidavit cites the factors outlined above and, as\n\n“reasons” that the fees are not reasonable and necessary, lists six items including (1) failure to\n\nexercise billing judgment, (2) inclusion of billing/costs for motions and/or discovery never filed\n\nor served, (3) failure to describe services and costs with sufficient particularity, (4) billing for\n\nservices and costs arising out of the federal administrative proceedings, (5) failure to segregate\n\nbilling and costs declaratory judgment claims from other claims, and (6) billing for services and\n\ncosts beyond the preparation of/attendance at items as reflected on the trial court’s docket sheet,\n\n                                               –13–\n\fa copy of which was attached. We conclude that, because these “reasons” did not provide\n\nunderlying facts to support the conclusion that the attorney’s fees were unreasonable, the\n\naffidavit was conclusory and therefore did not raise a fact issue on the question of the\n\nreasonableness of the requested attorney’s fees. See Brownlee v. Brownlee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1505453\"><a href=\"/opinion/1505453/brownlee-v-brownlee/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112\n\n(Tex. 1984). Further, having reviewed the record, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in making its award of attorney’s fees. See Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21.\n\n       Regarding the Union’s complaint that the trial court erred in granting TAPS’ motion to\n\nstrike its amended answer, rule 166a(c) provides that the trial court should render summary\n\njudgment based on the pleadings on file at the time of the hearing. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\nOnce the hearing date on the motion for summary judgment has passed, but before the court\n\nsigns a judgment, a party must obtain a written order from the trial court granting permission to\n\nfile an amended pleading.
