(Mother) appeals from the decrees of\n\nthe Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County (trial court), entered July 1,\n\n2015, that granted the petitions to terminate her parental rights to her\n\ndaughters, A.V., born in February of 2004, and N.L.C.C., born in June of\n\n2006, and her son, B.E.C.C., born in January of 2008 (Children). We affirm\n\non the basis of the trial court’s July 1, 2015 adjudication.1\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n    Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n1\n  A.V.’s father voluntarily relinquished his parental rights in person at a\nhearing on September 5, 2014.         The father of N.L.C.C. and B.E.C.C.\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\n      The trial court has set forth the relevant history of this case in its\n\nfindings of fact in its adjudication entered July 1, 2015.        (See Trial Ct.\n\nAdjudication, at 2-21).2        We adopt those findings for the purposes of this\n\nappeal.\n\n      The Lehigh County Office of Children and Youth Services filed petitions\n\nto terminate Mother’s parental rights to the Children on July 7, 2014. The\n\ntrial court held hearings on those petitions on September 5, 2014, and\n\nDecember 11 and December 12, 2014. The trial court entered its decrees\n\nterminating Mother’s parental rights pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(a)(1),\n\n(2), (5), (8) and (b), and its adjudication in support of those decrees on July\n\n1, 2015.      Mother filed her notice of appeal and statement of errors\n\ncomplained of on appeal on July 27, 2015. See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(2)(i). In\n\nresponse, on August 10, 2015, the trial court entered a statement pursuant\n\nto Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a)(2)(ii) in which it stated\n\nthat it had addressed the reasons for its decisions in its adjudication of July\n\n1, 2015. See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(2)(ii).\n\n      Mother raises the following questions on appeal:\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\nvoluntarily relinquished his parental rights in a written consent he signed on\nAugust 28, 2014. (See Trial Court Adjudication, 7/01/15, at 2 n. 1).\n2\n  We have redacted the copy of the trial court’s July 1, 2015 adjudication\nattached to this decision only to remove identifying information of certain\nindividuals. See Superior Court I.O.P. 424A (providing that Superior Court\ndecisions related to custody proceedings shall not contain the names of\nminors or identifying information of any other individuals involved).\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\n      1. Whether the trial court abused its discretion and committed\n      an error of law by terminating [M]other’s parental rights when\n      such determination was not supported by clear and convincing\n      evidence under 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(a)(1), (2), (5) and (8)?\n\n\n      2. Whether the trial court trial court [sic] abused its discretion\n      and committed an error of law by holding that termination will\n      serve the developmental, physical, and emotional needs and\n      welfare of the Children?\n\n(Mother’s Brief, at 7).\n\n      Our standard of review is as follows:\n\n      In an appeal from an order terminating parental rights, our\n      scope of review is comprehensive: we consider all the evidence\n      presented as well as the trial court’s factual findings and legal\n      conclusions. However, our standard of review is narrow: we will\n      reverse the trial court’s order only if we conclude that the trial\n      court abused its discretion, made an error of law, or lacked\n      competent evidence to support its findings. The trial judge’s\n      decision is entitled to the same deference as a jury verdict.\n\nIn re L.M., 923 A.2d 505, 511 (Pa. Super. 2007) (citations omitted).\n\n      Further, we have stated:\n\n            Where the hearing court’s findings are supported by\n      competent evidence of record, we must affirm the hearing court\n      even though the record could support an opposite result.\n\n                   We are bound by the findings of the trial court\n            which have adequate support in the record so long\n            as the findings do not evidence capricious disregard\n            for competent and credible evidence. The trial court\n            is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence\n            presented, and is likewise free to make all credibility\n            determinations and resolve conflicts in the evidence.\n            Though we are not bound by the trial court’s\n            inferences and deductions, we may reject its\n            conclusions only if they involve errors of law or are\n            clearly unreasonable in light of the trial court’s\n            sustainable findings.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\nIn re M.G., 855 A.2d 68, 73-74 (Pa. Super. 2004) (citations omitted).\n\n        The trial court terminated Mother’s parental rights pursuant to 23\n\nPa.C.S.A. § 2511(a)(1), (2), (5), (8), and (b). (See Trial Ct. Adjudication,\n\nat 25-32).    However, in order to affirm the termination of parental rights,\n\nthis Court need only agree with any one subsection of Section 2511(a), and\n\nwe therefore confine our discussion to subsection (a)(1). See In re B.L.W.,\n\n843 A.2d 380, 384 (Pa. Super. 2004) (en banc), appeal denied, 863 A.2d\n\n1141 (Pa. 2004).\n\n        Requests to have a natural parent’s parental rights terminated are\n\ngoverned by Section 2511 of the Adoption Act, which provides, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n        § 2511. Grounds for involuntary termination\n\n        (a) General rule.─The rights of a parent in regard to a child\n        may be terminated after a petition filed on any of the following\n        grounds:\n\n          (1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least\n          six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition\n          either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing\n          parental claim to a child or has refused or failed to perform\n          parental duties.\n\n                                    *    *    *\n\n        (b) Other considerations.─The court in terminating the rights\n        of a parent shall give primary consideration to the\n        developmental, physical and emotional needs and welfare of the\n        child. The rights of a parent shall not be terminated solely on\n        the basis of environmental factors such as inadequate housing,\n        furnishings, income, clothing and medical care if found to be\n        beyond the control of the parent. With respect to any petition\n        filed pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (6) or (8), the court shall not\n        consider any efforts by the parent to remedy the conditions\n\n                                        -4-\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\n      described therein which are first initiated subsequent to the\n      giving of notice of the filing of the petition.\n\n23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(a)(1), (b).\n     It is well settled that a party seeking termination of a parent’s rights\n\nbears the burden of proving the grounds to so do by “clear and convincing\n\nevidence,” a standard which requires evidence that is “so clear, direct,\n\nweighty, and convincing as to enable the trier of fact to come to a clear\n\nconviction, without hesitance, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.” In\n\nre T.F., 847 A.2d 738, 742 (Pa. Super. 2004) (citation omitted). Further,\n\n            A parent must utilize all available resources to preserve\n      the parental relationship, and must exercise reasonable firmness\n      in resisting obstacles placed in the path of maintaining the\n      parent-child relationship. Parental rights are not preserved by\n      waiting for a more suitable or convenient time to perform one’s\n      parental responsibilities while others provide the child with his or\n      her physical and emotional needs.\n\nIn the Interest of K.Z.S., 946 A.2d 753, 759 (Pa. Super. 2008) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n      To terminate parental rights pursuant to Section 2511(a)(1), the\n\nperson or agency seeking termination must demonstrate through clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that, for a period of at least six months prior to the\n\nfiling of the petition, the parent’s conduct demonstrates a settled purpose to\n\nrelinquish parental rights or that the parent has refused or failed to perform\n\nparental duties. See In re Adoption of M.E.P., 825 A.2d 1266, 1272 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2003).\n\n      With respect to subsection 2511(a)(1), our Supreme Court has held:\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\n           Once the evidence establishes a failure to perform parental\n     duties or a settled purpose of relinquishing parental rights, the\n     court must engage in three lines of inquiry: (1) the parent’s\n     explanation for his or her conduct; (2) the post-abandonment\n     contact between parent and child; and (3) consideration of the\n     effect of termination of parental rights on the child pursuant to\n     Section 2511(b).\n\nIn re Adoption of Charles E.D.M., 708 A.2d 88, 92 (Pa. 1988) (citation\n\nomitted). Further,\n\n     the trial court must consider the whole history of a given case\n     and not mechanically apply the six-month statutory provision.\n     The court must examine the individual circumstances of each\n     case and consider all explanations offered by the parent facing\n     termination of his or her parental rights, to determine if the\n     evidence, in light of the totality of the circumstances, clearly\n     warrants the involuntary termination.\n\nIn re B.N.M., 856 A.2d 847, 855 (Pa. Super. 2004), appeal denied, 872\n\nA.2d 1200 (Pa. 2005) (citations omitted).\n\n     In regard to incarcerated persons, our Supreme Court has stated:\n\n     [I]ncarceration is a factor, and indeed can be a determinative\n     factor, in a court’s conclusion that grounds for termination exist\n     under § 2511(a)(2) where the repeated and continued incapacity\n     of a parent due to incarceration has caused the child to be\n     without essential parental care, control or subsistence and that\n     [sic] the causes of the incapacity cannot or will not be remedied.\n\nIn re Adoption of S.P., 47 A.3d 817, 828 (Pa. 2012).\n\n     Further, in In re Adoption of S.P., the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\n\nstated:\n\n     [W]e now definitively hold that incarceration, while not a litmus\n     test for termination, can be determinative of the question of\n     whether a parent is incapable of providing “essential parental\n     care, control or subsistence” and the length of the remaining\n     confinement can be considered as highly relevant to whether\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\n     “the conditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect or\n     refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent,” sufficient\n     to provide grounds for termination pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. §\n     2511(a)(2). See e.g. Adoption of J.J., 515 A.2d at 891 (“[A]\n     parent who is incapable of performing parental duties is just as\n     parentally unfit as one who refuses to perform the duties.”); [In\n     re:] E.A.P., [944 A.2d 79, 85 (Pa. Super. 2008)] (holding\n     termination under § 2511(a)(2) supported by mother’s repeated\n     incarcerations and failure to be present for child, which caused\n     child to be without essential care and subsistence for most of her\n     life and which cannot be remedied despite mother’s compliance\n     with various prison programs). If a court finds grounds for\n     termination under subsection (a)(2), a court must determine\n     whether termination is in the best interests of the child,\n     considering the developmental, physical, and emotional needs\n     and welfare of the child pursuant to § 2511(b). In this regard,\n     trial courts must carefully review the individual circumstances for\n     every child to determine, inter alia, how a parent’s incarceration\n     will factor into an assessment of the child’s best interest.\n\nId. at 830-31.\n\n     The Adoption Act provides that a trial court “shall give primary\n\nconsideration to the developmental, physical and emotional needs and\n\nwelfare of the child.”   23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(b).    The Act does not make\n\nspecific reference to an evaluation of the bond between parent and child but\n\nour case law requires the evaluation of any such bond. See In re E.M., 620\n\nA.2d 481, 484-85 (Pa. 1993).    However, this Court has held that the trial\n\ncourt is not required by statute or precedent to order a formal bonding\n\nevaluation performed by an expert.    See In re K.K.R.-S., 958 A.2d 529,\n\n533 (Pa. Super. 2008).\n\n     With the above standard of review in mind, we have thoroughly\n\nreviewed the record, briefs, and the applicable law, and determined that the\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\nevidence presented is sufficient to support the trial court’s decrees\n\nterminating Mother’s parental rights to the Children pursuant to Section\n\n2511(a)(1).\n\n      In addition, our close reading of the trial court’s adjudication reveals\n\nthat the court carefully and methodically reviewed the evidence and ably\n\naddressed Mother’s issues presented on appeal. (See Trial Ct. Adjudication,\n\nat 25-32).    Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the concise, thoughtful,\n\nand well-written adjudication of the Honorable Douglas G. Reichley.       (See\n\nid. at 25-27 (finding Mother failed “to perform parental duties for a period of\n\nat least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition[]” where:\n\n(1) for twenty-one months prior to the hearing, Mother failed to perform\n\nparental duties for Children because she was incarcerated; (2) Mother has\n\nrefused to comply with court orders requiring her to obtain and maintain\n\nstable housing and legal income; (3) Mother does not take A.V. to court-\n\nordered trauma therapy; (3) Mother has not completed non-offending\n\nparenting treatment and follow its directives; (4) Mother has not complied\n\nwith the terms of her probation, “even though she knew that choice could\n\nsend her to prison and send her [C]hildren back into foster care[;]” and (5)\n\nit is Children’s best interest to terminate Mother’s parental rights)).\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the decrees of the Court of Common Pleas of\n\nLehigh County that terminated Mother’s parental rights.\n\n      Decrees affirmed.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fJ-S10031-16\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

C.S .A\n\n §2511 (b) analysis, the Pennsylvania Superi~r Court guides us as follows:\n\n                In In re C.MS., 884 A.2d 1284,.1287 (Pa. Super. 2005), this Court stated,\n         \"Intangibles such as love, comfort, security, and stability are involved in the\n         inquiry into needs and welfare of the. child.\". In addition, we instructed that the\n         orphans' court must also discern the' dature and status of' the parent-child bond,\n         with utmost attention to the effect on the child of permanently severing that bond.\n\n                                                                          29\n\f      Id.

In re K.K.R.-S., 958 A.2d 529, 533-536 (Pa. Super. 2008). The mere\n       existence of an emotional bond does not preclude the termination of parental\n       rights. See In re T.D., 949 A.2d 910 (Pa.

Additionally, this Court stated that the trial court should consider\n            the importance of continuity of relationships and where any existing\n            parent-child bond can be severed w\\tpci~t-detrimental effects on the child .\n                                                                             .,\n\nIn re N.A.M, 33 A.3d 95, 103 (Pa, Super. 2011).\\.\n\n       We note at the outset that Mother clearly loves all of her children.

Based on her· past\n\nchoices, we are convinced that Mother will not make choices that put her in a position to perform\n\nparental duties for the children within a reaso,q~bl~ period of time.

In addition, we instructed that the\n         orphans' court must also discern the' dature and status of' the parent-child bond,\n         with utmost attention to the effect on the child of permanently severing that bond.\n\n                                                                          29\n\f      Id. However, the extent of the bond-effect, analysis necessarily depends on the\n      circumstances of the particular case.

However, as expressed\n\nabove, the Court is primarily concerned with their safety and Mother's apparent inability to make\n\nwise choices for the protection of her children.\n\n       Due to Mother's medical neglect of N..L.C.C., all three children were away from Mother\n                                    i : . ::i.'; , ,,,-: ·\\(;(~.:,t'.: . ,·. .                                             .\nfor over a year in 2008-2009.

He was an infant when\n\nhe was separated from Mother the first time, was a toddler when he returned to her, and was\n\napproximately four years old when he left Mothe'r•s care again. Mother has not held a parenting\n\nrole with B.E.C.C.    ~ince then; thus, the es~~?{{atparental                                                                  role she should have had has\n                                                                              '\nnecessarily diminished.

When Mother does have\n\nthe opportunity to see him, she genera~ly focuses on her oldest son or A.V. rather than B.E.C.C.\n\nor .his sister N.L.C.C.

B.E.C.C. is very happy in the foster home. He is just\n\nlike part of the family. He soaks up the attention he gets from his stay-at-home foster dad. The\n\nCourt finds that Mother and B.E.C.C. have a-Jtinima!.bond, if any, and permanent severance of\n                                               •·' '   •    :    ,• ;'' ~ ~ ''       (~', ',:   ',,;   '        '   I\n\n\n\n\nparental ties will not result in any d~tri~~~tL't~· /lii1~/Permanence in this stable, loving, and\n\nnurturing home, where he will have continuing relationship with his siblings, will best serve the\n\ndevelopmental, physical and emotional needsand welfare of this child.\n\n        N.L.C.C. is also assimilated into the f?st~r home environment and is very happy there.\n\nHer foster family supports her in her dance acti_)!ities. ~~garding Mother, N.L.C.C. is more likely\n                                              . ·r . . .: .          .\nthan B.E.C.C. to show Mother physical affection and to communicate during visits with Mother;\n\nshe is not as detached during visits as her brother is.
