They claim that the accommodation substantially burdens their religious\n\nexercise in violation of RFRA by forcing them to take actions that cause their\n\nhealth plan administrators to provide contraceptive coverage and to maintain a\n\nhealth plan that serves as a conduit for contraceptive coverage. We reject the\n       1\n         We consider in this opinion the following district court orders: Eternal World Television\nNetwork, Inc. v. Burwell, 26 F. Supp. 3d 1228 (S.D. Ala. 2014); Roman Catholic Archdiocese of\nAtlanta v. Sebelius, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, 2014 WL 2441742 (N.D. Ga. May 30, 2014); and\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta v. Sebelius, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, 2014 WL\n1256373 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 26, 2014). The government filed separate appeals from the two orders\nin Roman Catholic Archdiocese, which were consolidated before this Court.\n\n\n                                                3\n\f             Case: 14-12696         Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 4 of 148\n\n\nplaintiffs’ claims because we conclude that the regulations do not substantially\n\nburden their religious exercise and, alternatively, because (1) the government has\n\ncompelling interests to justify the accommodation, and (2) the accommodation is\n\nthe least restrictive means of furthering those interests.\n\n      Eternal Word Television Network (“EWTN”), the plaintiff in the first\n\nappeal, also raises several First Amendment challenges to the accommodation.\n\nBecause the accommodation is a neutral, generally applicable law that does not\n\ndiscriminate based on religious denomination, we reject EWTN’s challenges under\n\nthe Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. We also reject EWTN’s challenge\n\nunder the Free Speech Clause because, as discussed below, any speech restrictions\n\nthat may flow from the accommodation are justified by a compelling governmental\n\ninterest and are thus constitutional.\n\n                               I.       BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The Affordable Care Act and the Contraceptive Mandate\n\n      Enacted in 2010, the ACA requires group health insurance plans to provide a\n\nminimum floor of coverage without imposing cost sharing (such as deductibles,\n\nco-payments, or co-insurance) on plan participants and beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300gg-13(a). If an employer fails to provide such coverage in its group\n\nemployee health plan, it is subject to penalties in the form of a tax of $100 per day\n\nper affected person. 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b)(1). The Women’s Health Amendment\n\n\n                                              4\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 5 of 148\n\n\nto the ACA added to the minimum coverage requirements a mandate that group\n\nhealth plans provide women with coverage for preventive care and screenings.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). The requirement was intended in part to “get[] rid of,\n\nor minimiz[e], high copays and high deductibles that are often overwhelming\n\nhurdles for women to access screening programs.” 155 Cong. Rec. S11987 (Nov.\n\n30, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski). The ACA tasked the Health Resources\n\nand Services Administration (“HRSA”), an agency of the Department of Health\n\nand Human Services (“HHS”), with promulgating comprehensive guidelines\n\ndetermining which preventive services and screenings would be required.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). HHS commissioned the Institute of Medicine\n\n(“IOM”) to assist with HRSA’s development of the guidelines.\n\n      The IOM released a full report in 2011 detailing its study of various\n\npreventive services and its recommendations for coverage under the mandate. Inst.\n\nof Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011)\n\n(“IOM Report”). The IOM Report discussed at length the positive public health\n\noutcomes associated with reducing unintended pregnancies and giving women\n\nmore control over birth spacing. The United States has a much higher rate of\n\nunintended pregnancies—49 percent of pregnancies in 2001—than other\n\ndeveloped countries. Id. at 102. Unintended pregnancies correlate with health\n\nproblems both for women who experience such pregnancies and for children born\n\n\n                                         5\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 6 of 148\n\n\nas a result of them. Id. at 103. And because women may not realize immediately\n\nthat they are pregnant, “their entry into prenatal care may be delayed[;] they may\n\nnot be motivated to discontinue behaviors that present risks for the developing\n\nfetus; and they may experience depression, anxiety, or other conditions.” Id.\n\nUnintended pregnancies also frequently end in abortion. Id. at 102.2\n\n       The IOM Report also noted the health consequences of pregnancies\n\noccurring too closely together in time. For infants, “[s]hort interpregnancy\n\nintervals in particular have been associated with low birth weight, prematurity, and\n\nsmall for gestational age births.” Id. at 103. For women, both pregnancy spacing\n\nand the ability to avoid pregnancy may significantly affect their health because,\n\namong other reasons, some “women with certain chronic medical conditions (e.g.,\n\ndiabetes and obesity) may need to postpone pregnancy until appropriate weight\n\nloss or glycemic control has been achieved.” Id. Pregnancy is also contraindicated\n\nfor some women with serious medical conditions, for example, pulmonary\n\nhypertension or Marfan syndrome. 3 Id. at 103-04. The IOM Report also found\n\n\n       2\n         A 2013 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 18\npercent of all pregnancies in the United States ended in abortion and noted that “unintended\npregnancy precedes nearly all abortions.” Karen Pazol, et al., Centers for Disease Control &\nPrevention, Abortion Surveillance—United States, 2010 (Nov. 29, 2013),\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6208a1.htm. The IOM Report noted that in\n2001, 42 percent of unintended pregnancies in the United States were terminated by abortion.\nIOM Report at 102.\n       3\n        Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue.\nPregnancy can be difficult for women with the condition because of the additional strain\n\n\n                                               6\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 7 of 148\n\n\nthat “greater use of contraception within the population produces lower unintended\n\npregnancy and abortion rates nationally.” Id. at 105.\n\n       Pursuant to its statutory authority, HRSA released binding guidelines, based\n\non the IOM Report, that require coverage for “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration\n\napproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education\n\nand counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.” U.S. Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., Health Res. & Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive Services\n\nGuidelines (“HRSA guidelines”), http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (last\n\nvisited Feb. 12, 2016); see also 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8725-26 (Feb. 15, 2012)\n\n(quoting the language in the HRSA guidelines regarding coverage). Implementing\n\nregulations developed by the Department of Labor, the Department of the\n\nTreasury, and HHS (collectively, the “Departments”) reiterate the contraceptive\n\nmandate’s requirement that health plans cover all services listed in the HRSA\n\nguidelines. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Treasury Regulation); 29 C.F.R\n\n§ 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Labor Regulation); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n\n(HHS Regulation).4\n\n\npregnancy places on the cardiovascular system. Nat’l Heart, Lung, & Blood Inst., What is\nMarfan Syndrome? (Oct. 1, 2010), http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/mar/.\n       4\n          The Departments have jointly developed regulations carrying out the ACA. To be\nconcise, whenever possible we cite only to the regulations issued by HHS, codified at 45 C.F.R.\npt. 147, and not to the corresponding identical regulations issued by the Departments of Labor\nand the Treasury.\n\n\n                                               7\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 8 of 148\n\n\n      Mindful of religious freedom and the importance of respect for “the unique\n\nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial\n\npositions,” the Departments promulgated interim regulations that gave HRSA\n\ndiscretion to exempt from the contraceptive mandate certain group health plans\n\nestablished or maintained by religious employers. See 76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46623\n\n(Aug. 3, 2011). The Departments defined “religious employer” by incorporating\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service’s definition of a church or integrated auxiliary from\n\n26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) and (iii). 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B) (2011).\n\nThe definition also required a religious employer to have a religious purpose and to\n\nboth serve and employ primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the\n\norganization. Id. Exercising the discretion the regulations provided, HRSA\n\namended its guidelines to exempt religious employers from the contraceptive\n\nmandate. The guidelines, issued on August 1, 2011, required compliance\n\nbeginning on August 1, 2012. See id. § 147.130(b)(1).\n\n      The Departments finalized the implementing regulations in February 2012.\n\nSee 77 Fed. Reg. 8725. At the same time, the Departments established a temporary\n\nsafe harbor from the contraceptive mandate for nonprofit organizations with\n\nreligious objections to providing contraceptive coverage. See Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain\n\nEmployers, Health Plans & Group Health Insurance Issuers with Respect to the\n\n\n                                         8\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 9 of 148\n\n\nRequirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing (Feb. 10,\n\n2012). The safe harbor remained in effect for the 2012 plan year, ending on\n\nAugust 1, 2013. See id. at 2.\n\n      The Departments intended to use the safe harbor period to “expeditiously\n\ndevelop and propose changes to the final regulations implementing” the\n\ncontraceptive mandate. 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503 (Mar. 21, 2012). The changes\n\nto the regulations needed to “meet two goals—accommodating non-exempt, non-\n\nprofit religious organizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive\n\nservices and assuring that participants and beneficiaries covered under such\n\norganizations’ plans receive contraceptive coverage without cost sharing.” Id. In\n\nMarch 2012, the Departments began the rulemaking process and solicited\n\ncomments on potential regulations that could achieve these two goals. Id. at\n\n16501.\n\n      At the conclusion of the rulemaking process in July 2013, the Departments\n\npromulgated revised regulations that retained HRSA’s authority to exempt\n\nreligious employers. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39870 (July 2, 2013). The same day,\n\nHRSA released revised guidelines that tracked the Departments’ changes to the\n\nreligious employer exemption. The final regulations simplified the definition of a\n\n“religious employer,” making the term coextensive with the IRS’s statutory\n\ndefinition and removing the additional qualifications regarding a religious\n\n\n                                          9\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 10 of 148\n\n\nemployer’s mission, programs, and employees. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) (2013); see\n\nalso 78 Fed. Reg. at 39873-74. Religious employers remained categorically\n\nexempt from the contraceptive mandate out of “respect [for] the religious interests\n\nof houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. The\n\nDepartments noted that the exemption did not undermine their goal of making\n\ncontraceptive coverage available because religious employers and their integrated\n\nauxiliaries “are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same\n\nfaith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than\n\nother people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under\n\ntheir plan.” Id.\n\n      The revised regulations, which took effect on Aug. 1, 2013, added an\n\naccommodation for organizations that do not qualify as religious employers under\n\nthe exemption. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b) (2013). So long as an organization is a\n\nnonprofit entity holding itself out as a religious organization and has a religious\n\nobjection to providing contraceptive coverage (we refer to such entities as “eligible\n\norganizations”), it may opt out of the contraceptive mandate. Id. 5\n\n\n      5\n          Under 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b), an organization is eligible for the accommodation if:\n      (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n      contraceptive items or services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n      on account of religious objections.\n      (2)     (i) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and\n      holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                 Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 11 of 148\n\n\n        Eligible organizations can take advantage of the accommodation via one of\n\ntwo procedures. The first procedure requires the organization to complete\n\nEmployee Benefits Security Administration Form 700 (“Form 700”). See EBSA\n\nForm 700–Certification (Aug. 2014),\n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc.\n6\n    To complete the two-page form, the eligible organization must provide its name\n\nand the name, title, and contact information of the individual signing the form on\n\nbehalf of the organization. The person signing the form must certify that the\n\norganization “has a religious objection to providing coverage for some or all of any\n\ncontraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                (ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held for-profit\n        entity, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the organization’s\n        highest governing body (such as its board of directors, board of trustees, or\n        owners, if managed directly by its owners) has adopted a resolution or similar\n        action, under the organization’s applicable rules of governance and consistent\n        with state law, establishing that it objects to covering some or all of the\n        contraceptive services on account of the owners’ sincerely held religious beliefs.\n        (3) The organization must self-certify in the form and manner specified by the\n        Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n        Services as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The organization must\n        make such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request by\n        the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of\n        this section applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person\n        authorized to make the certification or notice on behalf of the organization, and\n        must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements\n        under section 107 of ERISA.\n        6\n            Form 700 is included as the appendix to this opinion.\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 12 of 148\n\n\n       The form’s recipient depends on the type of health plan the eligible\n\norganization maintains. Employers can provide health benefits either through an\n\ninsured health plan or a self-insured health plan.7 See Cong. Budget Office, Key\n\nIssues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals 6 (2008). If the eligible\n\norganization has an insured plan, it gives Form 700 to the insurance company that\n\nprovides its health plan (“plan provider”); if the organization has a self-insured\n\nplan, it gives Form 700 to its third-party administrator (“TPA”). The plaintiffs in\n\nboth cases before us provide health benefits to their employees through self-\n\ninsured group health plans, and all employ TPAs to administer their plans.\n\n       Alternatively, an eligible organization may directly notify HHS of its\n\nreligious objection to complying with the contraceptive mandate. This more\n\nrecently developed method of taking advantage of the accommodation arose from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court’s order granting a preliminary injunction in\n\nWheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014). After the regulations\n\nconcerning the exemption and accommodation procedures were finalized, the\n\nSupreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2759-60\n\n(2014), extended the accommodation for nonprofit religious organizations to\n       7\n          For insured health plans, the employer contracts with an insurance company that\nadministers the group plan and pays claims. For self-insured plans, the financial risk of\nproviding health insurance lies with the organization itself; the organization directly pays for the\nplan participants’ and beneficiaries’ claims. Usually, organizations with self-insured plans hire a\nthird party to handle administrative tasks, such as developing provider networks and processing\nclaims.\n\n\n                                                12\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 13 of 148\n\n\nclosely held for-profit corporations whose owners have religious objections to\n\ncomplying with the contraceptive mandate. Three days after the Hobby Lobby\n\ndecision was issued, the Supreme Court in Wheaton College granted a request for a\n\npreliminary injunction pending appellate review to a plaintiff challenging the\n\naccommodation itself under RFRA, the same challenge the plaintiffs mount here.\n\nWheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The Supreme Court’s order enjoined HHS from\n\nenforcing the accommodation procedure against the college, so long as the college\n\n“inform[ed] the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that it is a non-\n\nprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to\n\nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.” Id. The Supreme Court warned,\n\nhowever, that the injunction order “should not be construed as an expression of the\n\nCourt’s views on the merits.” Id.8\n\n       In response to the order in Wheaton College, the Departments issued interim\n\nfinal regulations in August 2014 to allow an eligible organization to opt out by\n\nsending a letter to HHS, instead of giving Form 700 to its plan provider or TPA.\n\n79 Fed. Reg. 51092, 51094-95 (Aug. 27, 2014); see Ctr. for Medicare & Medicaid\n\nServs., Model Notice, https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-\n\n\n\n       8\n         The Seventh Circuit recently resolved Wheaton College’s appeal, affirming the district\ncourt’s denial of the college’s request for a preliminary injunction. Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell,\n791 F.3d 792 (7th Cir. 2015).\n\n\n                                               13\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 14 of 148\n\n\nGuidance/Downloads/Model-Notice-8-22-14.pdf (last visited Feb. 12, 2016).9\n\nThere is no prescribed format for the letter, but it must include:\n\n       the name of the eligible organization and the basis on which it\n       qualifies for an accommodation; its objection based on its sincerely\n       held religious beliefs to coverage of some or all contraceptive\n       services, as applicable (including an identification of the subset of\n       contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization\n       objects, if applicable); the plan name and type . . . ; and the name and\n       contact information for any of the plan’s third party administrators\n       and health insurance issuers.\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(ii).\n\n       The regulations became final, without substantial changes, in a set of new\n\nrules effective on September 14, 2015. 80 Fed. Reg. 41318 (July 14, 2015). Under\n\nthe current rules, if an eligible organization directly notifies HHS of its intent to\n\nopt out of the contraceptive mandate, the government then alerts the organization’s\n\nhealth plan provider or TPA that the organization has opted out and describes the\n\nplan provider’s or TPA’s resulting obligations. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii).\n\n       For insured plans, once an eligible organization avails itself of the\n\naccommodation, the plan provider must (1) “[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive\n\n       9\n          The interim final regulations also removed a provision (known as the non-interference\nprovision) requiring that eligible organizations “‘must not, directly or indirectly[,] seek to\ninterfere with a third party administrator’s arrangements to provide or arrange for separate\npayments for contraceptive services,’ and ‘must not, directly or indirectly, seek to influence a\nthird party administrator’s decision to make any such arrangements.’” 79 Fed. Reg. at 51095\n(quoting 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(iii)).\n\n\n                                               14\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 15 of 148\n\n\ncoverage from the group health insurance coverage” and (2) “[p]rovide separate\n\npayments for any contraceptive services required to be covered” for the plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i).\n\n       For self-insured plans, the regulations provide that when an eligible\n\norganization invokes the accommodation, its TPA is designated as the plan\n\nadministrator under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”),\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1002(16), with respect to contraceptive services. Under the\n\nregulations, the TPA is designated as the plan administrator in one of two ways. If\n\nthe eligible organization provides a copy of Form 700 to its TPA, then the\n\nregulations treat the form “as a designation of the [TPA] as the plan administrator”\n\nfor ERISA purposes. 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). If the eligible organization\n\ninstead notifies HHS of its intent to opt out, then the Department of Labor notifies\n\nthe TPA that it shall be the plan administrator with respect to contraceptive\n\nservices for ERISA purposes. Id.\n\n       Upon receiving notification, the TPA has the option of terminating its\n\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization.10 See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n\n       10\n           If the TPA terminates the relationship, the organization must (1) contract with a new\nTPA to administer its self-insured plan, (2) convert to an insured plan by contracting with a plan\nprovider, or (3) administer the plan itself. If the eligible organization contracts with a new TPA,\nthen it remains subject to the mandate and must provide contraceptive coverage, seek an\naccommodation, or pay a penalty. Alternatively, the organization could restructure its plan and\ncontract with a plan provider that would assume the risk of providing health insurance (that is,\nchange from a self-insured to an insured plan). In this scenario, the organization would have to\n\n\n                                                15\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 16 of 148\n\n\n2713A(b)(2). If it remains as the TPA, then it must provide (or arrange for another\n\ninsurer to provide) contraceptive benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the\n\nself-insured plan. Id.; 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(c). 11\n\n       Significantly, plan providers and TPAs “may not impose any cost-sharing\n\nrequirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any\n\npremium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the\n\neligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.”\n\n26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(c)(2)(i); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii).12 Plan\n\nproviders “must segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible\n\norganization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive\n\ncomply with the mandate, seek an accommodation, or pay a penalty. Finally, the organization\ncould continue with its self-insured plan without a TPA, meaning the organization would assume\nresponsibility for administering claims. Although the Departments are unaware of the existence\nof a single self-insured plan without a TPA, they have created a safe harbor that excuses such a\nplan from complying with the contraceptive mandate so long as it annually notifies HHS that it\nhas no TPA and plan participants and beneficiaries that contraceptive coverage is not provided.\nThe Departments will provide this safe harbor while considering an additional accommodation.\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39880-81.\n       11\n          Self-insured plans run by houses of worship and certain organizations controlled by or\nassociated with a house of worship, known as “church plans,” are not subject to the provisions of\nERISA unless they elect otherwise. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 410(d), 414(e). The government lacks\nauthority to compel the TPA of a church plan not subject to ERISA to provide contraceptive\ncoverage. See 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2). Nonetheless, the TPA for a church plan may voluntarily\nprovide contraceptive services; the government incentivizes these TPAs to provide the coverage\nby offering larger reimbursements. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41323 n.22; 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d).\n       12\n          The government reimburses plan providers and TPAs for providing contraception\nbenefits. Plan providers receive a downward adjustment to the user fees they must pay to the\nfederal government to sell plans on the federally-facilitated health exchanges. The process for\nTPAs can be more complicated. If the TPA is not itself a participating insurer, then it must\ncontract for contraceptive coverage with a participating insurer, and the insurer then passes on\nthe reimbursement to the TPA. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n\n                                                16\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 17 of 148\n\n\nservices.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). A plan provider or TPA also must notify\n\nplan participants and beneficiaries (contemporaneously with the delivery of other\n\nplan materials, if possible) “that the eligible organization does not administer or\n\nfund contraceptive benefits,” but that the plan provider or TPA instead “provides\n\nseparate payments for contraceptive services.” 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(d);\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(d).\n\nB.    The Parties and Procedural History\n\n      This opinion addresses two cases: one brought by EWTN and one brought\n\nby two Catholic Dioceses and a group of related persons and entities. Below, we\n\nbriefly discuss the plaintiffs and the procedural history of each case in turn.\n\n      1.     Eternal Word Television Network\n\n      Plaintiff-appellant EWTN is a non-profit worldwide Catholic media network\n\nfounded in 1981 by Mother Mary Angelica, a Catholic nun. EWTN, based in\n\nIrondale, Alabama, has approximately 350 employees. The network consists of 11\n\ntelevision feeds and two radio stations that reach 230 million homes in 144\n\ncountries and territories. Its programming includes daily Mass, Catholic devotions,\n\ncoverage of Catholic Church events, documentaries, children’s programs,\n\neducational series, and other television and radio shows that support EWTN’s\n\nmission of “serv[ing] the orthodox belief and teaching of the Church as proclaimed\n\nby the Supreme Pontiff and his predecessors.” Compl. at 5, No. 1:13-cv-00521-\n\n\n                                          17\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 18 of 148\n\n\nCG-C, Doc. 1. EWTN has a self-insured group health plan to provide health\n\ninsurance benefits to its employees. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as\n\nthe TPA for the plan.\n\n       EWTN, together with the State of Alabama, 13 filed a complaint challenging\n\nthe contraceptive mandate and accompanying regulations under RFRA, the First\n\nAmendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. The complaint\n\nalleged that “EWTN cannot facilitate access to health care insurance . . . that\n\ncovers artificial contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and\n\ncounseling, without violating its deeply held religious beliefs.” Compl. at 7, No.\n\n1:13-cv-00521-CG-C, Doc. 1. To EWTN, this means that its religious beliefs\n\nprevent it both from providing contraceptive coverage in its health plan and from\n\nusing the accommodation. As a result, EWTN alleged, the contraceptive mandate\n\n“imposes government pressure and coercion on EWTN to change or violate its\n\nreligious beliefs” because if it does not provide coverage or use the\n\naccommodation, it faces fines for non-compliance with the mandate. Id. at 27.\n\n       EWTN and Alabama moved for partial summary judgment on five of the 17\n\ncounts in the complaint, including: Count One, alleging a violation of RFRA\n\n\n       13\n        Alabama was a party throughout the district court proceedings, but the State did not\njoin EWTN in this appeal.\n\n\n                                              18\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 19 of 148\n\n\nbased on the regulations’ burden on religious exercise; Count Two, alleging a\n\nviolation of the Free Exercise Clause based on the same burden; Count Three,\n\nalleging a violation of the Free Exercise Clause based on intentional discrimination\n\namong religious organizations; Count Five, alleging a violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause based on the selective imposition of a burden on some\n\nreligious organizations; and Count Nine, alleging a violation of the Free Speech\n\nClause based on compelled speech. Alabama joined in EWTN’s motion and\n\nadditionally moved for summary judgment on Count Seventeen, which sought a\n\ndeclaration that the contraceptive mandate does not preempt Alabama law.\n\n      The defendants-appellees—the Departments and their Secretaries—filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on all\n\nof the plaintiffs’ claims. The district court denied EWTN’s and Alabama’s\n\nmotions for summary judgment and granted the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment as to Counts One, Two, Five, and Nine. On a motion by the plaintiffs,\n\nthe district court entered a final judgment on those four counts pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and stayed litigation of the remaining claims\n\npending appeal.\n\n      EWTN timely appealed. On EWTN’s motion, we issued an injunction\n\npending appeal, preventing the defendants from enforcing the mandate or the\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 20 of 148\n\n\naccommodation against EWTN. Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec’y,\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 756 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2014).\n\n      2.     The Diocesan Plaintiffs, CENGI, and Catholic Charities\n\n      A group of Catholic entities—the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta,\n\nthe Archbishop of Atlanta, Christ the King Catholic School, Catholic Charities of\n\nthe Archdiocese of Atlanta (“Catholic Charities”), the Roman Catholic Diocese of\n\nSavannah, and the Bishop of Savannah—filed a lawsuit against the Departments\n\nand their Secretaries. Both the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of\n\nSavannah (collectively with the Bishop and Archbishop, “the Dioceses”) are\n\nassociations of Catholic parishes and organizations, including Catholic schools.\n\nCatholic Charities is a nonprofit organization that provides social services,\n\nincluding immigration counseling, mental health counseling, marriage counseling,\n\nand pregnancy support services. The second amended complaint added as a\n\nplaintiff Catholic Education of North Georgia (“CENGI”) and removed Christ the\n\nKing Catholic School. CENGI is a nonprofit organization that oversees five\n\nCatholic schools in the Atlanta area.\n\n      The Atlanta Archdiocese operates a self-insured health plan, which covers\n\nemployees of the Archdiocese, Catholic Charities, and CENGI. The Savannah\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 21 of 148\n\n\nDiocese operates two self-insured health plans for its employees. Meritain Health\n\nserves as the TPA for all three plans.14\n\n       The second amended complaint alleged that the contraceptive mandate and\n\naccompanying regulations violate RFRA, the First Amendment, the non-delegation\n\ndoctrine, 15 and the APA. The plaintiffs alleged that the regulations require them\n\n“to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate insurance coverage for abortion-inducing\n\ndrugs, sterilization, and contraception, in violation of their religious beliefs.”\n\nSecond Am. Compl. at 6, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, Doc. 56. They alleged that the\n\nregulations further burden religious exercise “by driving a wedge between\n\nreligious organizations, like the Atlanta Archdiocese, and their equally religious\n\ncharitable arms, such as Plaintiffs Catholic Charities and CENGI.” Id. Because\n\nthe charitable arms do not qualify as “religious employers,” the Dioceses alleged\n\n       14\n           The parties disagree over whether these health plans qualify as “church plans” for\npurposes of ERISA. We need not decide whether the plans at issue are church plans because\ntheir ERISA status does not impact our conclusion that the accommodation does not\nsubstantially burden religious exercise. If the plans are not church plans, then our analysis as to\nEWTN’s self-insured plan applies, and the accommodation presents no burden on religious\nexercise. See infra Part III.A.2.b. If the plans are church plans, then the government lacks\nauthority to enforce the contraceptive mandate against the plaintiffs’ TPAs, rendering the\nplaintiffs’ assertion that their actions trigger such coverage even weaker. See, e.g., Little Sisters\nof the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151, 1188 (10th Cir.) (“The lack of\nenforcement authority makes any burden on plaintiffs with church plans even less substantial\nthan the burden on plaintiffs with self-insured plans that are subject to ERISA.”), cert. granted\nsub nom., S. Nazarene Univ. v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 445, and cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 446 (2015).\n       15\n          The non-delegation doctrine is the constitutional principle that prevents Congress from\ndelegating its legislative authority to another body with “unfettered discretion to make whatever\nlaws” the body sees fit. A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537-38\n(1935).\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 22 of 148\n\n\nthey must expel the charities’ employees from their health plans if the Dioceses\n\nwish to take advantage of the religious exemption.16\n\n       The Departments filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint\n\nor, alternatively, for summary judgment on all counts. The plaintiffs cross-moved\n\nfor summary judgment as to seven of their eight counts, which alleged that the\n\nmandate and accompanying regulations: burden religious exercise in violation of\n\nRFRA (Count One); violate the Free Exercise Clause, based on the same burden\n\n(Count Two); compel speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause (Count Three);\n\nprohibit speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause (Count Four); favor certain\n\nreligious groups and entangle the government in religion in violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause (Count Five); interfere with internal church governance in\n\nviolation of both the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses (Count Six); and\n\ninvolve an impermissible delegation of unchecked legislative authority to the\n\nDepartments (Count Seven).\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to Catholic Charities and\n\nCENGI on their RFRA claims, holding that the contraceptive mandate and\n\naccommodation substantially burden the organizations’ religious exercise and are\n\nnot the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.\n\n\n       16\n         We note that there is no dispute that EWTN, CENGI, and Catholic Charities qualify for\nthe accommodation and not for the religious employer exemption.\n\n\n                                             22\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 23 of 148\n\n\nThe court enjoined the Departments from enforcing the mandate or the\n\naccommodation against Catholic Charities and CENGI. In addition, the court\n\ngranted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on their claim that the non-\n\ninterference provision created a content-based speech restriction in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\n      As to the Dioceses’ RFRA claim, the court granted summary judgment to\n\nthe Departments. The Dioceses had argued first that they might at some point have\n\nto pay more in premiums to help cover their plan providers’ cost of contraceptive\n\ncoverage, in violation of their religious beliefs, and second that the distinction\n\nbetween religious employers and organizations eligible for the accommodation\n\nwould force the Dioceses to remove unaffiliated Catholic schools from their\n\ninsurance plans. Rejecting both arguments, the district court ruled that the first\n\nargument was merely speculative (and the outcome on which the Dioceses\n\nspeculated would, in any event, be prohibited by law) and the second argument\n\nfailed to assert a legitimate religious exercise. The district court granted the\n\nDepartments’ summary judgment motion as to all of the plaintiffs’ remaining\n\nclaims based on the First Amendment, the non-delegation doctrine, and the APA.\n\n      Despite the split judgment, only the Departments appealed the district\n\ncourt’s decision. Because revisions to the regulations have rendered the plaintiffs’\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 24 of 148\n\n\ncompelled speech claim based on the non-interference provision moot,17 the appeal\n\nin this case concerns only the district court’s grant of summary judgment to\n\nCatholic Charities and CENGI on their RFRA claim.\n\n                            II.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       “This court reviews the district court’s disposition of cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards used by the district\n\ncourt, viewing the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-movant, and resolving all reasonable doubts about the facts in\n\nfavor of the non-moving party.” Am. Bankers Ins. Group v. United States, 408\n\nF.3d 1328 (11th Cir. 2005). Summary judgment is proper if the movant can show\n\n“that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Where the material facts\n\nare undisputed and all that remains are questions of law, summary judgment may\n\nbe granted. See Saregama India Ltd. v. Mosley, 635 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th Cir.\n\n2011).\n\n\n\n\n       17\n          As noted above, in 2014 the Departments removed the regulations’ requirement that\norganizations “must not, directly or indirectly, seek to influence the third party administrator’s\ndecision to” provide contraceptive coverage to the objecting organization’s health plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii) (2013); see 79 Fed. Reg. at\n51095; supra note 9.\n\n\n                                                24\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 25 of 148\n\n\n                                III.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.    RFRA Claims\n\n      1.     Legal Background\n\n             a.     RFRA\n\n      RFRA provides that the federal government “shall not substantially burden a\n\nperson’s exercise of religion” unless it demonstrates that the burden “is in\n\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-\n\n1(a)-(b). Congress passed RFRA in 1993 in response to the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), which held that “a law that is neutral and of general\n\napplicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if\n\nthe law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.”\n\nChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993)\n\n(characterizing Smith). In Smith, the Supreme Court reasoned that “[t]o make an\n\nindividual’s obligation to obey [a neutral and generally applicable] law contingent\n\nupon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State’s\n\ninterest is ‘compelling[,]’ . . . contradicts both constitutional tradition and common\n\nsense.” Smith, 494 U.S. at 885 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 26 of 148\n\n\n      Congress stated that the purpose of RFRA was “to restore the compelling\n\ninterest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin\n\nv. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972).” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b)(1). Congress declared the\n\nstrict scrutiny standard provided “a workable test for striking sensible balances\n\nbetween religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.” Id.\n\n§ 2000bb(a)(5). Indeed, RFRA “provide[s] even broader protection for religious\n\nliberty than was available under” Sherbert or Yoder because the government must\n\nalso show that it used the least restrictive means to achieve its compelling interest.\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2761 n.3.\n\n             b.     Hobby Lobby\n\n      In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court held that enforcing the contraceptive\n\nmandate without an accommodation against closely held for-profit corporations\n\nthat objected on religious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage violated\n\nRFRA. The corporations and their owners challenged the mandate as substantially\n\nburdening their religious exercise. Id. at 2764-66. The owners of the corporations\n\nsincerely believed that life begins at conception and that it is a sin to facilitate\n\naccess to contraceptive drugs or devices that could destroy an embryo. Id. It was\n\nundisputed that the mandate required the plaintiffs to provide health insurance that\n\ncovered methods of contraception that could result in the destruction of an embryo.\n\nId. at 2775. The plaintiffs asserted that the mandate left them with only two\n\n\n                                           26\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 27 of 148\n\n\noptions: (1) provide coverage for contraception in violation of their religious\n\nbeliefs or (2) pay significant penalties. Given these choices, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that the mandate “impose[d] a substantial burden.” Id. at 2779.\n\n      The government argued there was no substantial burden because the\n\nconnection between what the mandate required the plaintiffs to do (provide health\n\ninsurance that covered contraception) and the end that they found morally wrong\n\n(the destruction of an embryo) was too attenuated. Id. at 2777. The premise of the\n\ngovernment’s attenuation argument was that “providing the coverage would not\n\nitself result in the destruction of an embryo; that would occur only if an employee\n\nchose to take advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four [contraceptive]\n\nmethods at issue.” Id. In other words, the government asserted that the plaintiffs’\n\nbelief—that providing insurance coverage for contraception facilitated the\n\ndestruction of embryos—was unreasonable. The Supreme Court rejected this\n\nargument, which would have required the Court to determine the “circumstances\n\nunder which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but\n\nthat has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by\n\nanother.” Id. at 2778. The Supreme Court cautioned that “federal courts have no\n\nbusiness addressing” such questions of religion and moral philosophy. Id. Instead,\n\nthe Supreme Court deferred to the plaintiffs’ religious belief that the coverage “is\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 28 of 148\n\n\nconnected to the destruction of embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it\n\nimmoral for them to provide the coverage.” Id.\n\n       The Court then considered whether the mandate survived strict scrutiny.\n\nThe majority assumed that the mandate furthered a compelling governmental\n\ninterest 18 but held that it was not the least restrictive means of doing so. Id. at\n\n2779-80. The Court pointed to the accommodation, which at the time applied only\n\nto nonprofit organizations with religious objections, as a less restrictive alternative.\n       18\n           The majority opinion assumed without deciding that the government has a compelling\ninterest. In separate opinions, five members of the Court appeared to go further, suggesting that\na majority of the Court would agree that there is, in fact, a compelling interest.\n        The four dissenting justices concluded that the government carried its burden in showing\nthat the mandate “furthers compelling interests in public health and women’s well being.”\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Justice Kennedy, who joined the\nmajority, offered a separate concurrence in which he emphasized the importance of the\nmajority’s assumption that there is a compelling interest without explicitly stating that he agreed\nwith that premise: “[it is] important to confirm that a premise of the Court’s opinion is its\nassumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in\nthe health of female employees.” Id. at 2786 (Kennedy, J., concurring). He also reiterated the\ngovernment’s position that the mandate “provid[ed] insurance coverage that is necessary to\nprotect the health of female employees, coverage that is significantly more costly than for a male\nemployee.” Id. at 2785-86.\n        Justice Ginsburg in her dissent and other courts have treated Justice Kennedy’s\nconcurrence as recognizing that the government has a compelling interest. See id. at 2800 n.23\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (writing that Justice Kennedy “recognize[d], without reservation,” the\nexistence of a compelling interest); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 606, 624 (7th Cir.\n2015) (Hamilton, J., concurring) (“Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion made clear that he\nviewed the governmental interests as compelling.”); Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\nHuman Servs., 772 F.3d 229, 257 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining why Justice Kennedy’s\nconcurrence was “more affirmative” than the majority opinion in recognizing a compelling\ninterest), cert. granted sub nom., Roman Catholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct.\n444 (2015), and cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 446 (2015). We are inclined to agree that Justice\nKennedy’s concurring opinion can be read as recognizing a compelling interest. Nonetheless,\neven if Justice Kennedy merely assumed (but did not decide) there is a compelling interest, such\nthat a majority of the Supreme Court has not reached that conclusion, we conclude that there is a\ncompelling interest here. See infra Part III.B.2.c.(i).\n\n\n                                                28\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 29 of 148\n\n\nThe Court explained that after an organization opts out, the plan provider (for\n\ninsured plans) or TPA (for self-insured plans) must exclude contraceptive coverage\n\nfrom the group health plan and provide separate payments for contraceptive\n\ncoverage without imposing cost sharing requirements on the organization, plan, or\n\nplan participants or beneficiaries. Id. at 2782. Although the Court declined to\n\nanswer whether the accommodation complied with RFRA, it lauded the\n\naccommodation as “seek[ing] to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit\n\ncorporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the\n\nsame access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies\n\nwhose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage.” Id. at\n\n2759. The Court further recognized that “[t]he effect of the HHS-created\n\naccommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other\n\ncompanies involved in these cases would be precisely zero.”19 Id. at 2760.\n\n               c.      Wheaton College\n\n       After Hobby Lobby, the Court considered the accommodation itself in the\n\ncontext of an injunction sought under RFRA in Wheaton College. The Court\n\nenjoined the government from enforcing the mandate but required the plaintiff to\n\n       19\n           Justice Kennedy praised how the accommodation reconciled the competing priorities\nof ensuring that “no person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or\nher religion” and that the same exercise does not “unduly restrict other persons . . . in protecting\ntheir own interests, interests the law deems compelling.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2786-87\n(Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 30 of 148\n\n\ninform HHS in writing that it had religious objections to providing coverage for\n\ncontraceptive services. 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The Court explained that the\n\ngovernment could “rely[] on this notice . . . to facilitate the provision of full\n\ncontraceptive coverage.” Id. The practical effect of the Wheaton College decision\n\nwas twofold: the plaintiff received an accommodation, and HHS could rely on the\n\nnotification to provide contraceptive coverage to the participants and beneficiaries\n\nof the plaintiff’s plan.\n\n              d.     Other RFRA Challenges to the Accommodation\n\n       After Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College, federal courts around the country\n\nconsidered RFRA challenges to the accommodation. Applying these two Supreme\n\nCourt decisions, seven of the eight circuits to review these cases held that the\n\naccommodation does not violate RFRA. See Mich. Catholic Conf. & Catholic\n\nFamily Servs. v. Burwell, 807 F.3d 738 (6th Cir. 2015); Catholic Health Care Sys.\n\nv. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2015); Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the\n\nAged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir.), cert. granted sub nom., S. Nazarene\n\nUniv. v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 445, and cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 446 (2015); E. Tex.\n\nBaptist Univ. v. Burwell, 793 F.3d 449 (5th Cir.), cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 444\n\n(2015); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell (“Notre Dame II”), 786 F.3d 606 (7th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 31 of 148\n\n\n2015);20 Geneva Coll. v. Sec’y U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 778 F.3d 422\n\n(3d Cir.), cert. granted sub nom., Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 444, and cert.\n\ngranted, 136 S. Ct. 445 (2015); Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs. (“Priests for Life I”), 772 F.3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014), reh’g en banc denied,\n\n(“Priests for Life II”), 808 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2015), cert. granted sub nom., Roman\n\nCatholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 444 (2015), and cert. granted,\n\n136 S. Ct. 446 (2015). These circuits concluded that the accommodation does not\n\nsubstantially burden religious exercise.21 The Eighth Circuit disagreed, holding\n\nthat the accommodation substantially burdens religious exercise and cannot survive\n\nstrict scrutiny. Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs.,\n\n801 F.3d 927 (8th Cir. 2015), petition for cert. filed, 84 U.S.L.W. 3350 (U.S. Dec.\n\n15, 2015) (No. 15-775). Recently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in several\n\nof these cases.\n\n       The seven circuits that upheld the accommodation recognized that the RFRA\n\nclaim in Hobby Lobby was fundamentally different from challenges to the\n       20\n         Before Hobby Lobby was decided, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the denial of a\npreliminary injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the mandate and accommodation in\nUniversity of Notre Dame v. Sebelius (“Notre Dame I”), 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014).\nSubsequently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Seventh Circuit’s judgment in\nNotre Dame I, and remanded for consideration in light of Hobby Lobby. Univ. of Notre Dame v.\nBurwell, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015). After considering Hobby Lobby, the Seventh Circuit issued\nNotre Dame II again affirming the denial of a preliminary injunction.\n       21\n         Two circuits have held, in the alternative, that even assuming the accommodation\nimposes a substantial burden, it survives strict scrutiny under RFRA. See Notre Dame II,\n786 F.3d at 616-17; Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 256-57.\n\n\n                                              31\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 32 of 148\n\n\naccommodation itself. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the mandate—\n\nthat is, the requirement that they provide contraceptive coverage—when their only\n\noptions were to provide the coverage or pay significant penalties. But in the\n\naccommodation cases, the plaintiffs have challenged the regulatory scheme that\n\nallows them to opt out of the mandate without penalty. Put another way, the\n\nplaintiffs in the accommodation cases “do not challenge the general obligation\n\nunder the ACA to provide contraceptive coverage. They instead challenge the\n\nprocess they must follow to get out of complying with that obligation.” Little\n\nSisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1160. Because they assert that “the exemption\n\nprocess itself imposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths,” their\n\nchallenges are somewhat “paradoxical and virtually unprecedented.” Priests for\n\nLife I, 772 F.3d at 246 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The circuits upholding the accommodation recognized that the question of\n\nwhether there is a substantial burden involves an objective inquiry. After\n\ninterpreting the ACA and its regulations, they held that the act of opting out does\n\nnot trigger contraceptive coverage. See, e.g., Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 614\n\n(explaining that “[i]t is federal law, rather than the religious organization’s signing\n\nand mailing the form, that requires . . . third-party administrators of self-insured\n\nhealth plans[] to cover contraceptive services”). Although the eligible\n\norganizations asserted that the act of opting out makes them complicit in providing\n\n\n                                          32\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 33 of 148\n\n\ncoverage, these courts explained that this objection could not constitute a\n\nsubstantial burden because individuals “have no RFRA right to be free from the\n\nunease, or even anguish, of knowing that third parties are legally privileged or\n\nobligated to act in ways their religion abhors.” Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 246.\n\n       In Sharpe Holdings, the Eighth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion,\n\nholding that the accommodation substantially burdened religious exercise, and\n\nenjoined the government from enforcing the accommodation. Relying on Hobby\n\nLobby, the Eighth Circuit held that it was bound to accept the plaintiffs’ “assertion\n\nthat self-certification under the accommodation process—using either Form 700 or\n\nHHS Notice—would violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.” 22 Sharpe\n\nHoldings, 801 F.3d at 941. Because the plaintiffs faced a substantial penalty if\n\nthey failed to seek an accommodation or provide contraceptive coverage, the\n\nEighth Circuit concluded there was a substantial burden. Id. at 942.\n\n       The Eighth Circuit then applied strict scrutiny. The court assumed that the\n\ngovernment had a compelling interest but held that the government had failed to\n\ncarry its burden to show that it lacked other means to achieve its interest without\n\nimposing a substantial burden on religion. Id. at 943. The Eighth Circuit\n\n\n       22\n         Although the Eighth Circuit deferred to the plaintiffs’ understanding of how the\naccommodation functioned, it agreed that the act of opting out triggered coverage. See Sharpe\nHoldings, 801 F.3d at 942 (TPAs have no “wholly independent obligation” to provide\ncontraceptive coverage).\n\n\n                                              33\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 34 of 148\n\n\nconcluded that less restrictive alternatives included the government: (1) requiring\n\nless information from eligible organizations seeking an accommodation; (2)\n\nassuming the cost of providing contraceptives through subsidies, reimbursements,\n\ntax credits, or tax deductions to employees; (3) paying for distribution of\n\ncontraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals; or (4)\n\nmaking contraceptive coverage available through the healthcare exchanges. Id. at\n\n944-45. Given these alternatives, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the\n\naccommodation failed to survive strict scrutiny.\n\n       2.     RFRA Analysis\n\n       With this legal landscape in mind, we now consider the plaintiffs’ RFRA\n\nchallenge. We hold that their challenge fails because (1) the accommodation does\n\nnot substantially burden their religious exercise, and (2) in the alternative, even if\n\nthere is a substantial burden, the accommodation survives strict scrutiny.\n\n              a.     The Plaintiffs Allege a Sincere Religious Belief.\n\n       A threshold question we must ask is whether the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs\n\non which their RFRA claims are based are sincere. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2774 n.28 (“To qualify for RFRA’s protection, an asserted belief must be\n\n‘sincere’. . . .”). It is well established that we defer to a plaintiff’s statement of its\n\nown belief, so long as the plaintiff actually holds that belief. See id. at 2779 (“[I]t\n\nis not for [courts] to say that [the plaintiffs’] religious beliefs are mistaken or\n\n\n                                            34\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 35 of 148\n\n\ninsubstantial.”); Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198, 1204 (11th Cir.) (“[W]e look\n\nonly to see whether the claimant . . . actually holds the beliefs he claims to hold.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied sub nom., Davila v. Hayes, 136 S.\n\nCt. 78 (2015).\n\n       Each plaintiff states that its religious beliefs prevent it from paying for,\n\nproviding, or facilitating the distribution of contraceptives. Each plaintiff also\n\nasserts that it cannot be complicit in the provision of contraception. The\n\ngovernment does not contest the sincerity of these religious beliefs, nor is there any\n\nindication whatsoever in the record that the stated beliefs are insincere. We thus\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs at issue are sincere.\n\n             b.     The Accommodation Does Not Substantially Burden the\n                    Plaintiffs’ Religious Exercise.\n\n      We now consider whether, accepting the plaintiffs’ sincere religious beliefs,\n\nthe accommodation substantially burdens their religious exercise. The plaintiffs\n\nassert that the act of notifying HHS or their TPAs of their religious objection will\n\neither trigger contraceptive coverage or make them complicit in a system that\n\nprovides such coverage. Due to the significance they attach to opting out, the\n\nplaintiffs contend that the accommodation itself imposes a substantial burden\n\nbecause it puts them to the choice of violating their sincerely held religious beliefs\n\nor paying a substantial penalty. We accept the plaintiffs’ sincere belief that\n\ntriggering coverage or being complicit in coverage violates their religious beliefs\n                                           35\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 36 of 148\n\n\nand that the accommodation puts them to a choice between honoring their religious\n\nbeliefs and facing significant penalties. We nonetheless conclude that the\n\naccommodation imposes no substantial burden.\n\n                     (i)     The Substantial Burden Analysis Involves an\n                             Objective Inquiry.\n\n       “[A] ‘substantial burden’ must place more than an inconvenience on\n\nreligious exercise.” Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214,\n\n1227 (11th Cir. 2004). 23 A law is substantially burdensome when it places\n\n“significant pressure” on an adherent to act contrary to her religious beliefs,\n\nmeaning that it “directly coerces the religious adherent to conform . . . her\n\nbehavior.” Id. Thus, the government imposes a substantial burden when it places\n\n“pressure that tends to force adherents to forego religious precepts.” Id.\n\n       This inquiry involves both subjective and objective dimensions. Hobby\n\nLobby made clear that there is a subjective aspect to this inquiry: courts must\n\naccept a religious adherent’s assertion that his religious beliefs require him to take\n\nor abstain from taking a specified action. See 134 S. Ct. at 2779. But the\n\n\n       23\n           Midrash concerned the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n(“RLUIPA”), which Congress enacted after the Supreme Court struck down RFRA as applied to\nthe states in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997). RLUIPA imposes the same\nrequirement as RFRA—that the government refrain from substantially burdening religious\nexercise unless the burden is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government\ninterest—on programs and activities that receive federal funding. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1. We\napply the same substantial burden analysis under both RLUIPA and RFRA. See generally\nDavila, 777 F.3d at 1204; Midrash, 366 F.3d at 1237.\n\n\n                                              36\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 37 of 148\n\n\nsubstantial burden analysis does not end there. We agree with our seven sister\n\ncircuits that the question of substantial burden also presents “a question of law for\n\ncourts to decide.” Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 247.\n\n      The objective inquiry requires courts to consider whether the government\n\nactually “puts” the religious adherent to the “choice” of incurring a “serious”\n\npenalty or “engag[ing] in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs.”\n\nHolt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 862 (2015) (second alteration in original and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, courts must determine what\n\nthe challenged law actually requires of the plaintiff. For example, in Holt, a\n\nMuslim inmate asserted that prison grooming policy substantially burdened his\n\nreligious exercise because it prohibited him from growing a beard, which his\n\nreligion required. The Supreme Court explained that because the “grooming\n\npolicy requires petitioner to shave his beard,” the policy “put[]” him to the choice\n\nof violating his religious beliefs or facing serious disciplinary action. Id. In Holt,\n\nas in many RFRA cases, this inquiry was straightforward because there was no\n\ndispute about what the government’s policy objectively required of the religious\n\nadherent. But when there is a dispute about what a law or governmental policy\n\nobjectively requires, it is for the courts to construe the law or policy.\n\n      The plaintiffs here contend that under Hobby Lobby no such objective\n\ninquiry is required. In their view, a religious adherent’s mere assertion that she is\n\n\n                                           37\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 38 of 148\n\n\nbeing compelled to violate her sincerely held religious belief means that the\n\ngovernment has put her to such a choice, regardless of what the law objectively\n\nrequires.24 We disagree. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the\n\ncontraceptive mandate. It was undisputed that the mandate gave the plaintiffs just\n\ntwo options: provide contraceptive coverage or pay a substantial penalty.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court engaged in no objective analysis about what the\n\nmandate required, such analysis was unnecessary because the parties agreed that\n\nthe government, through the mandate, put the plaintiffs to the choice of providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage or paying a hefty fine. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2777-79; see also Priests for Life II, 808 F.3d at 2 (Pillard, J.) (concurring in denial\n\nof reh’g en banc) (“The parties in Hobby Lobby did not dispute what the law\n\nrequired, nor its practical effects . . . .”).\n\n       Here, the parties agree that the plaintiffs have at least three options: provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage, pay a penalty, or use the accommodation to opt out of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage. 25 But they disagree about whether opting out\n\n\n       24\n          The Eighth Circuit similarly interpreted Hobby Lobby as requiring courts to “accept\n[the plaintiffs’] assertion that self-certification under the accommodation process . . . would\nviolate their sincerely held religious beliefs.” Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 941.\n       25\n          We agree with the dissent that the plaintiffs have a fourth option, as well: to terminate\ntheir TPAs and take over the costs and responsibilities of running their self-insured plans. See\nDissent at 109-10. But, the Departments contend there is no evidence of the existence of any\nself-insured plan without a TPA. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39880 (“[T]he Departments continue to\nbelieve that there are no self-insured group health plans in this circumstance.”). If an eligible\norganization elected to become the first self-insured plan without a TPA, it would enjoy at least a\n\n\n                                                 38\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 39 of 148\n\n\nputs the plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or paying a\n\nsubstantial fine. The plaintiffs contend that because an eligible organization’s TPA\n\nonly becomes obligated to provide coverage when the organization opts out, by\n\nopting out they will be triggering coverage. The government argues to the contrary\n\nthat plan participants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive coverage under\n\nthe ACA regardless of any opt out. We conclude that it is for the courts to\n\ndetermine objectively what the regulations require and whether the government\n\nhas, in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs by\n\nseeking the accommodation or incurring a substantial penalty.\n\n       We reject a framework that takes away from courts the responsibility to\n\ndecide what action the government requires and leaves that answer entirely to the\n\nreligious adherent. Such a framework improperly substitutes religious belief for\n\nlegal analysis regarding the operation of federal law. Indeed, the plaintiffs have\n\nidentified nothing in RFRA or case law that allows a religious adherent to dictate\n\nto the courts what the law requires. The plain language of RFRA simply does not\n\nsupport reducing the role of federal courts to “rubber stamps” that automatically\n\n\ntemporary safe harbor so long as the plan notifies (1) HHS that it has no TPA and (2) plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries that the plan provides no benefits for contraceptive services. Id.\n        We assume for purposes of this appeal that if the government forced an eligible\norganization to have a self-insured plan without a TPA, it would be imposing a substantial\nburden. Nonetheless, we conclude there is no substantial burden because eligible organizations\ncan instead select the accommodation.\n\n\n                                                39\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 40 of 148\n\n\nrecognize a substantial burden whenever a religious adherent asserts there is one.\n\nCatholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 218. If Congress had intended strict\n\nscrutiny to be triggered in all circumstances by a religious adherent’s claim that\n\nthere is a burden, it would have said so. Instead, it required that the federal\n\ngovernment “substantially burden” the adherent’s religious exercise.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague concedes that the question of substantial burden\n\ninvolves an objective inquiry but asserts that the inquiry should be limited to\n\nwhether the government has imposed a substantial penalty. See Dissent at 113-15.\n\nThis analysis would require courts to defer to a religious adherent’s sincere belief\n\nthat the government is forcing her to choose between her religious belief and\n\npaying a substantial fine, even when the religious adherent is objectively wrong\n\nabout how the law operates and what action the government requires her to take.\n\nThe dissent’s view is flawed because any burden (even an objectively insubstantial\n\none) becomes a substantial burden if the penalty is heavy enough.\n\n      We acknowledge that in Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court cautioned courts\n\nagainst dictating to religious adherents “the circumstances under which it is\n\nimmoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the\n\neffect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.”\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2778. In some cases, a court’s objective analysis interpreting a statute\n\nor regulation may contradict a religious adherent’s sincerely held belief about what\n\n\n                                          40\n\f               Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 41 of 148\n\n\nthat law requires. But such questions about what a law means are not the type of\n\n“difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy” for which\n\ncourts must defer to religious adherents. Id.; see Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 623\n\n(Hamilton, J., concurring) (explaining that the interpretation of the regulations that\n\ngive rise to the accommodation “is an issue not of moral philosophy but of federal\n\nlaw”).\n\n         Deciding how the law functions is not the only objective part of the\n\nsubstantial burden inquiry. The Supreme Court’s free exercise cases (prior to\n\nSmith) distinguished between substantial burdens on religious exercise, which are\n\nprotected, and de minimis burdens, which are not. For example, a religious\n\nadherent may not “require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in\n\nways that comport” with the person’s religious beliefs, even if the government\n\naction interferes with that person’s religious exercise. Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693,\n\n699-700 (1986); see Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439,\n\n451 (1988) (recognizing that government’s decision to log and build roads would\n\n“have severe adverse effects” on practice of Native American religion but\n\nconcluding this burden was not “heavy enough” to trigger strict scrutiny under the\n\nFree Exercise Clause).\n\n         In Bowen, Native American parents challenged federal statutes requiring\n\nthem to provide their daughter’s social security number to state welfare agencies as\n\n\n                                           41\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 42 of 148\n\n\na condition of seeking benefits on the ground that it impinged upon their free\n\nexercise of religion. They sought an accommodation to keep the government from\n\nusing her social security number in administering benefits, which they believed\n\nwould rob their daughter of her spirit. 476 U.S. at 695-96.\n\n      Even recognizing that the parents had a sincere belief that by using her\n\nsocial security number the government would be stealing their daughter’s spirit,\n\nthe Supreme Court rejected their claim, holding that the government’s “use of a\n\nSocial Security number . . . does not itself in any degree impair [the parents’]\n\nfreedom to believe, express, and exerc[ise their] religion.’” Id. at 700 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The Court rejected the parents’ attempt to use the Free\n\nExercise Clause to “demand that the Government join in their chosen religious\n\npractices.” Id. at 699-700. The Court explained that “[t]he Free Exercise Clause\n\naffords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion,”\n\nyet does not extend so far to “afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of\n\nthe Government’s internal procedures.” Id. at 700. The Court acknowledged that\n\nthe parents’ “religious views may not accept” the line that the Court drew\n\n“between individual and governmental conduct,” but it drew a line nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 43 of 148\n\n\nId. at 701 n.6. Likewise, under RFRA courts must determine whether the burden\n\non a religious adherent is, in fact, substantial.26\n\n       As we alluded to above, the plain language of RFRA supports our\n\nconclusion that there is a distinction between a burden and a substantial burden.\n\nRFRA requires strict scrutiny only when the government “substantially burden[s] a\n\nperson’s exercise of religion.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). Congress chose to\n\nmodify “burden” with “substantial[],” 27 and we must of course interpret RFRA to\n\ngive full effect to its every word. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31\n\n(2001) (recognizing that statutes should be construed whenever possible so that\n\n“no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n       26\n           We reiterate that in Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court did not grapple with this aspect of\nthe substantial burden analysis. But it was plain that the action required of the plaintiffs in that\ncase—paying to provide health insurance that included contraceptive coverage—imposed a\nsubstantial burden. Accordingly, the Court had no occasion to address the more difficult\nquestion presented here, where the plaintiffs’ claims of substantial burden rest on their assertion\nthat seeking an accommodation results in another entity (the TPA) providing contraceptive\ncoverage and thus makes them complicit in a system that achieves an end to which they have a\nreligious objection. In other words, Hobby Lobby did not pose the issue whether courts must\ndefer to a religious adherent’s assertion that seeking an accommodation (opting out) itself\nimposes a substantial burden.\n       27\n           Congress used “substantial burden” instead of “burden” in order “to clarify [that] the\ncompelling interest required by the Religious Freedom [Restoration] Act applies only where\nthere is a substantial burden placed on the individual free exercise of religion.” 139 Cong. Rec.\nS14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (emphasis added). Limiting RFRA’s\napplication to substantial burdens was intended to ensure that the government was not required\n“to justify every action that has some effect on religious exercise.” Id.\n\n\n                                                43\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 44 of 148\n\n\n      We recognize that the distinction between burden and substantial burden is\n\nnot implicated in every RFRA case. Nonetheless, there are cases brought under\n\nRFRA in which the purported burden is too slight to trigger strict scrutiny. For\n\nexample, in Kaemmerling v. Lappin, an inmate challenged under RFRA the Bureau\n\nof Prison’s collection and analysis of his DNA. 553 F.3d 669, 673-74 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2008). He claimed that the government’s sampling, collection, and analysis of his\n\nDNA violated his sincerely held religious beliefs about the proper use of DNA.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit concluded there was no substantial burden. Importantly, the\n\ninmate had no religious objection to the collection of his bodily material; he\n\nchallenged only how the government would subsequently use that specimen to\n\nextract his DNA information. Id. at 678-79. There was no question that the\n\nBureau of Prisons required the inmate to submit a bodily specimen that would be\n\nused for an end to which he had a strong religious objection (that is, the collection\n\nand analysis of his DNA). But the D.C. Circuit held there was no substantial\n\nburden because the inmate “suggest[ed] no way in which these government acts\n\npressure[d] him to modify his own behavior in any way that would violate his\n\nbeliefs.” Id. at 679. Kaemmerling reinforces that a religious adherent cannot use\n\nRFRA to stop the government or third parties from taking subsequent actions to\n\nwhich he objects when the acts required of him impose a de minimis burden.28\n\n      28\n           Our dissenting colleague worries that our framework creates a “Bizarro World” in\n\n\n                                               44\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 45 of 148\n\n\n                      (ii)    No Substantial Burden Exists.\n\n       To determine whether the accommodation objectively puts plaintiffs to the\n\nchoice of violating their religious beliefs or paying a significant fine, we must\n\nunderstand how the accommodation functions and what it requires of these\n\nplaintiffs. The only act that the regulations require the plaintiffs to take is to seek\n\nthe accommodation—that is, filling out and sending Form 700 to their TPAs or\n\nwriting a letter to HHS letting it know of their objections. The plaintiffs do not\n\ncontend that notifying HHS or their TPAs itself constitutes a substantial burden\n\nbecause of the time or effort involved. Rather, their objection is based on the\n\nsignificance they attribute to this act. They contend that the act of opting out\n\ntriggers contraceptive coverage for plan participants and beneficiaries or makes\n\nthem complicit in a system that provides contraceptive coverage. We accept that\n\nthe plaintiffs truly believe that triggering contraceptive coverage or being complicit\n\nin a system providing contraceptive coverage violates their religious beliefs. But\n\nwhich courts determine whether the burden imposed by a law or regulation violates the\nadherent’s beliefs. Dissent at 117-18. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying\nthat courts may determine that when a prison requires a Muslim inmate to shave his beard or the\ngovernment forces a Seventh-Day Adventist to work on the Sabbath, the religious adherent’s\nclaim that the government is coercing him to forego his religious precepts is wrong. But when a\ndispute exists about whether the challenged governmental policy actually requires an inmate to\nshave his beard or a person to work on Saturday, it is for the courts to determine what the law\nrequires. See, e.g., Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403-04 (Supreme Court performed its own analysis to\ndetermine whether challenged policy compelled Seventh-Day Adventist to work on Saturdays).\nLikewise, when a religious adherent challenges an accommodation scheme as imposing a\nsubstantial burden on the religious adherent based on subsequent actions taken by the\ngovernment or third parties, it is for the courts to determine whether the burden is substantial.\n\n\n                                               45\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 46 of 148\n\n\nour objective inquiry leads us to conclude that the government has not put\n\nplaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or facing a significant\n\npenalty. We hold there is no substantial burden.\n\n       Here’s why: the ACA and HRSA guidelines are what entitle plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to contraceptive coverage. The ACA provides that\n\nthe plaintiffs’ self-insured plans “shall, at a minimum provide coverage for and\n\nshall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . . . with respect to women, such\n\nadditional preventative care and screenings . . . as provided for in” the HRSA\n\nguidelines. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). The HRSA Guidelines, in turn, “require\n\ncoverage, without cost sharing, for ‘[a]ll . . . [FDA] approved contraceptive\n\nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all\n\nwomen with reproductive capacity.’” 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725 (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting HRSA guidelines).\n\n       The plaintiffs and the dissent take a different view of the statutory and\n\nregulatory scheme, contending that an eligible organization’s act of opting out\n\ntriggers the TPA’s designation as plan administrator and, without it, plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries would not receive contraceptive coverage.29 Indeed,\n\n\n       29\n       Because the plaintiffs here have only self-insured plans, we consider only the\naccommodation procedures that apply to self-insured health plans.\n      For an eligible organization with a plan insured by a third party, the accommodation\nimposes no new coverage obligation. The eligible organization’s act of opting out simply makes\n\n\n                                              46\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 47 of 148\n\n\nthe dissent asserts that opting out requires an eligible organization’s “affirmative\n\nparticipation” because the act of opting out is the “linchpin on which the\n\ncontraceptive mandate rests.” Dissent at 125. We disagree.\n\n       The ACA and the HRSA guidelines—not the opt out—are, to borrow the\n\ndissent’s term, the “linchpins” of the contraceptive mandate because they entitle\n\nwomen who are plan participants and beneficiaries covered by group health\n\ninsurance plans to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing. In other words,\n\nwomen are entitled to contraceptive coverage regardless of their employers’ action\n\n(or lack of action) with respect to seeking an accommodation. Because a woman’s\n\nentitlement to contraceptive benefits does not turn on whether her eligible\n\norganization employer chooses to comply with the law (by providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage or seeking an accommodation) or pay a substantial penalty (in the form\n\nof a tax) for noncompliance, we cannot say that the act of opting out imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden. 30\n\n\n\nthe coverage the plan provider’s “sole responsibility rather than one shared with the group health\nplan itself.” Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1181.\n       30\n           The dissent complains that our reading renders the act of opting out “meaningless.”\nDissent at 128 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dissent misses our point. Although plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive coverage under federal law regardless\nof any opt out, notification of the opt out allows the government to identify the plan participants\nand beneficiaries who will not receive contraceptive coverage from a self-insured eligible\norganization because of that organization’s religious objection to the mandate. In other words,\nthe act of opting out aids the government in identifying these women and making sure that they\nreceive the contraceptive coverage to which they are legally entitled. Thus, the act of opting out\n\n\n                                                47\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 48 of 148\n\n\n       We do not mean to imply that the act of opting out plays no causal role in\n\nthe ultimate provision of contraceptive coverage. We acknowledge that an eligible\n\norganization’s act of notifying HHS or its TPA of its objection results in the TPA’s\n\ndesignation as the plan administrator and gives rise to the TPA’s obligation to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage.31 See 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). But we view an\n\neligible organization’s act of opting out as, at most, an incidental cause of plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries receiving contraceptive coverage because these\n\nwomen are entitled to contraceptive coverage under the ACA and HRSA\n\nguidelines regardless of whether the eligible organization opts out. Accordingly,\n\neven if the act of opting out in some way leads to women receiving the\n\ncontraceptive coverage to which they were entitled under federal law, the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to establish that the act of opting out substantially burdens their\n\nreligious exercise. Importantly, the government does not force an eligible\n\norganization to provide contraceptive coverage, pay costs related to contraceptive\n\ncoverage, notify plan participants and beneficiaries of the existence of such\n\ncoverage, or even include the availability of such coverage from a separate source\n\nin information the plan provides to plan participants and beneficiaries. Instead, all\n\nhas significance in the regulatory scheme, but not because it creates a woman’s entitlement to\ncontraceptive coverage.\n       31\n          Indeed, the government has admitted that an eligible organization’s opt out results in a\nTPA’s designation as plan administrator and the TPA providing plan participants and\nbeneficiaries contraceptive benefits.\n\n\n                                                48\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 49 of 148\n\n\nof these responsibilities fall upon the TPA. Rather, the only action required of the\n\neligible organization is opting out: literally, the organization’s notification of its\n\nobjection. Such an opt out requirement is “typical of religious objection\n\naccommodations that shift responsibility to non-objecting entities only after an\n\nobjector declines to perform a task on religious grounds.” Little Sisters of the\n\nPoor, 794 F.3d at 1183.\n\n       The plaintiffs’ challenge is in substance indistinguishable from an objection\n\nto the government’s requiring another entity to provide coverage in their stead.\n\nSee Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 224 (characterizing an identical\n\nchallenge as seeking a “blanket religious veto over the government’s interactions\n\nwith others”). Put differently, the plaintiffs’ opposition to opting out is an\n\nobjection to their inability to keep the TPA with which they have contracted to\n\nprovide services in connection with healthcare coverage from complying with the\n\nrelevant regulations. The plaintiffs point to a but-for causal relationship between\n\ntheir opting out and the conduct that they find religiously objectionable. But, as\n\nthe Supreme Court has explained, a religious adherent cannot claim a substantial\n\nburden based on the subsequent conduct of another party. 32 See Bowen, 476 U.S.\n\n\n       32\n          The plaintiffs argue that under the accommodation they are facilitating access to\ncontraceptives because their ongoing contractual relationship with their TPA leads the TPA to\ncontinue to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries. It is true that a\nTPA remains as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive coverage only so long as the\norganization serves as the plan’s TPA. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs cannot show a substantial\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 50 of 148\n\n\nat 699-700 (“Just as the government may not insist that appellees engage in any set\n\nform of religious observance, so appellees may not demand that the Government\n\njoin in their chosen religious practices by refraining from using a number to\n\nidentify their daughter.”). 33\n\n       We recognize that the plaintiffs sincerely abhor and object to the subsequent\n\nacts taken by the government and their TPA, which ultimately result in the TPA\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries. We\n\nacknowledge that they “may not accept [the] distinction” that we draw here\n\nbetween their conduct and the downstream, separate conduct of HHS and the TPAs\n\nto provide coverage. Id. at 701 n.6. But we simply cannot say that RFRA affords\n\nthe plaintiffs the right to prevent women from obtaining contraceptive coverage to\n\nwhich federal law entitles them based on the de minimis burden that the plaintiffs\n\nface in notifying the government that they have a religious objection.\n\n       As the Seventh Circuit first articulated, an analogy to a conscientious\n\nobjector to the military draft illustrates why the accommodation does not impose a\n\n\nburden because, as explained above, their challenge is an objection to the TPA’s subsequent\nconduct.\n       33\n          The dissent dismisses Bowen as distinguishable because the plaintiffs here object only\nto their own participation in the accommodation, not to any acts taken by the government. See\nDissent at 126-27 n.32. We are not persuaded. The dissent’s position ignores that the plaintiffs\nobject to opting out because it requires them to play a causal role (albeit, a small one) in a system\nin which the government requires contraceptive coverage. Put another way, their religious\nobjection is, at its core, an objection to the government requiring the TPAs to provide coverage\nupon their opting out.\n\n\n                                                 50\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 51 of 148\n\n\nsubstantial burden. See Notre Dame I, 743 F.3d at 556. A religious conscientious\n\nobjector to the military draft may opt of military service based on his belief that\n\nwar is immoral. The objector sincerely believes that his act of opting out triggers\n\nthe drafting of another person in his place, and thus renders him complicit in the\n\nvery thing to which he objects. But we would reject the assertion that the\n\ngovernment’s subsequent act of drafting another person in his place—even though\n\nthe drafting was in some sense caused by the objector’s act of opting out—\n\ntransforms the act of lodging a conscientious objection into a substantial burden.\n\nSee id. Likewise, we reject the plaintiffs’ assertion that opting out imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden because the government requires a third party to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage after an eligible organization opts out.\n\n      Accordingly, we conclude that through the accommodation the government\n\nhas imposed no substantial burden on the plaintiffs. We thus hold that the\n\naccommodation does not violate RFRA.\n\n             c.     The Accommodation Survives Strict Scrutiny.\n\n      Even assuming that the accommodation imposes a substantial burden on\n\nplaintiffs’ religious exercise, RFRA allows the government to impose such a\n\nburden when it demonstrates that the burden “is in furtherance of a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest” and “is the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). Because the\n\n\n                                          51\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 52 of 148\n\n\ngovernment has carried its burden of showing that the accommodation is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering its compelling interests, we hold in the alternative\n\nthat the accommodation survives strict scrutiny under RFRA.\n\n                      (i)    Compelling Interests Justify the Accommodation.\n\n       In applying RFRA’s strict scrutiny test, we must first determine whether the\n\naccommodation is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.” Id.\n\nBecause the mandate and accommodation require the provision of cost-free\n\ncontraceptive coverage with little to no administrative burden on women, these\n\nregulations further compelling government interests in avoiding the adverse public\n\nhealth consequences of unintended pregnancies and in assuring women the equal\n\nbenefit of preventative care by requiring coverage for their distinctive health\n\nneeds.34 See Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 258-59.\n\n\n\n\n       34\n          As we explained above, the majority in Hobby Lobby assumed without deciding that\nthere was a compelling governmental interest. There is, however, an argument that five justices\nconcluded there was a compelling interest. See supra note 18. But even if Justice Kennedy’s\nconcurring opinion in Hobby Lobby did not recognize a compelling governmental interest, we\nwould hold that the compelling interest test is satisfied here.\n        We acknowledge that the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby criticized the government’s\npurported interests in “promoting public health and gender equality” as “broadly framed.” 134\nS. Ct. at 2779 (internal quotation marks omitted). But we agree with the D.C. Circuit that the\ngovernment has now provided a more focused analysis “by explaining how those larger interests\ninform and are specifically implicated in its decision to support women’s unhindered access to\ncontraceptive coverage.” Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 259.\n\n\n                                               52\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 53 of 148\n\n\n                             (a)     The Government’s Interests in Reducing the\n                                     Rate of Unintended Pregnancies Are\n                                     Compelling.\n\n       We begin our analysis with the facts: unintended or poorly spaced\n\npregnancies have a host of negative impacts on women and children. See supra\n\nPart I.A. Women who experience unintended pregnancies are often unaware of\n\ntheir condition in the early stages of their pregnancy, which leads them to delay\n\nprenatal care and cessation of behaviors such as smoking or alcohol consumption.\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39872. Babies born as a result of unintended pregnancies are at a\n\ngreater risk of premature birth and low birth weight. Id. Short interpregnancy\n\nintervals also result in a greater risk of prematurity and low birth weight. Id.\n\nContraceptive use can alleviate these public health problems. 35 “[G]reater use of\n\ncontraception within the population produces lower unintended pregnancy and\n\nabortion rates nationally.” IOM Report at 105.\n\n       During debate over the ACA, Congress was informed that “[i]n America\n\ntoday, too many women are delaying or skipping preventive care because of the\n\ncosts of copays and limited access.” 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (Dec. 1, 2009)\n\n(statement of Sen. Gillibrand). The IOM Report also found that “cost-sharing\n\n       35\n           Many contraceptives also carry significant positive health side effects. “[T]he non-\ncontraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception include treatment of menstrual disorders, acne\nor hirsutism, and pelvic pain. Long-term use of oral contraceptives has been shown to reduce a\nwoman’s risk of endometrial cancer, as well as protect against pelvic inflammatory disease and\nsome benign breast diseases.” IOM Report at 107 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n                                               53\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 54 of 148\n\n\nrequirements, such as deductibles and copayments, can pose barriers to care and\n\nresult in reduced use of preventive and primary care services, particularly for low-\n\nincome populations.” IOM Report at 109. The Women’s Health Amendment,\n\nwhich added to the ACA the requirement that group and individual health plans\n\nprovide women with coverage for preventative care and screenings, aimed to\n\nincrease women’s use of preventive care by removing administrative and financial\n\nbarriers. See 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (statement of Sen. Shaheen) (“Too often,\n\nwomen forgo their health care needs because they are not affordable. We know\n\ncost plays a greater role in preventing women from accessing health care than it\n\ndoes men. In 2007, more than half of all women reported problems accessing\n\nneeded health care because of costs.”); see also Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 260\n\n(explaining that Congress and the Executive branch determined with the ACA and\n\nits regulations that “serving the government’s compelling public health interests\n\ndepends on overcoming the human behavioral tendencies of denial and delay\n\ndocumented in the legislative and regulatory record”).\n\n      Moreover, the Women’s Health Amendment, which added the contraceptive\n\nmandate to the ACA’s minimum coverage requirements, specifically addressed the\n\nneed to provide preventive care to women to rectify past gender discrimination in\n\nhealth insurance. As the Departments noted, “the statute acknowledges that both\n\nexisting health coverage and existing preventive services recommendations often\n\n\n                                          54\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 55 of 148\n\n\ndid not adequately serve the unique health needs of women. This disparity placed\n\nwomen in the workforce at a disadvantage compared to their male coworkers.” 36\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39873; see also 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (statement of Sen.\n\nGillibrand) (“The prevention section of the bill before us must be amended so\n\ncoverage of preventive services takes into account the unique health care needs of\n\nwomen throughout their lifespan.”). Indeed, before the ACA, “women of\n\nchildbearing age spent 68 percent more on out-of-pocket health care costs than\n\nmen.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39887. The Departments explained that this\n\n“disproportionate” financial burden “prevented women from achieving health\n\noutcomes on an equal basis with men.” Id. The Departments intended the\n\ncontraceptive coverage requirement to “help[] to equalize the provision of\n\npreventative health care services to women and, as a result, help[] women\n\ncontribute to society to the same degree as men.” Id. As the Departments\n\nexplained, “[r]esearch shows that access to contraception improves the social and\n\neconomic status of women.” Id. at 39873; see generally Claudia Goldin &\n\nLawrence F. Katz, The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives & Women’s Career\n\n& Marriage Decisions, 110 J. of Pol. Econ. 731 (2002).\n\n       36\n          See also 155 Cong. Rec. S11987 (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (“Women are often\nfaced with the punitive practices of insurance companies. No. 1 is gender discrimination.\nWomen often pay more and get less. For many insurance companies, simply being a woman is a\npreexisting condition. . . . We pay more because of our gender, anywhere from 2 percent to over\n100 percent.”).\n\n\n                                              55\n\f            Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 56 of 148\n\n\n      Based on this evidence, we conclude that the government’s interests in the\n\npublic health of women and children, as well as in assuring women equal\n\npreventative care, are compelling.\n\n                           (b)    The Mandate and Accommodation Further\n                                  These Compelling Interests.\n\n      The mandate and accommodation achieve the government’s goals by\n\nmaking contraceptives affordable and otherwise accessible to women. As\n\nexplained above, federal law generally guarantees women contraceptive coverage\n\nwithout cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4); 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725\n\n(discussing HRSA guidelines). Importantly, under the mandate and\n\naccommodation, women covered by group health insurance plans generally are\n\nrequired to take no additional action to obtain this contraceptive coverage. This is\n\nbecause the coverage is delivered “through the existing employer-based system of\n\nhealth coverage.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888. Thus, under the mandate, women need\n\nnot complete extra paperwork or sign up for an additional program because the\n\ncontraceptive coverage is delivered with the health insurance they already have\n\nthrough their employers.\n\n      This is true even when an employer opts out of providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage by seeking an accommodation. Although objecting employers are not\n\nobligated to provide or pay for contraceptives, the women covered by their plans\n\nseamlessly receive contraceptive coverage from the plans’ TPAs. This system was\n                                           56\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 57 of 148\n\n\ncarefully designed to make contraceptive coverage accessible by not requiring\n\nwomen to research plans that offer contraceptive coverage, purchase separate\n\ncontraceptive coverage, or even sign up with a different entity or program. See id.\n\nAs the Supreme Court acknowledged in Hobby Lobby, the Departments designed\n\nthe accommodation so that it has “precisely zero” impact on female plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries. 134 S. Ct. at 2760; see also id. at 2759 (explaining\n\nthe accommodation “ensur[es] that the employees of [eligible organizations] have\n\nprecisely the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of\n\ncompanies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such\n\ncoverage”).37\n\n       Providing women with such seamless coverage should result in a lower\n\nunintended pregnancy rate. Medical evidence reflects a causal relationship\n\nbetween the accessibility of contraceptives and the unintended pregnancy rate:\n\n“progress in reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy would be possible by\n\nmaking contraceptives more available, accessible, and acceptable.” IOM Report at\n\n104 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 109 (“[C]ost-sharing\n\nrequirements, such as deductibles and copayments, can pose barriers to care and\n\nresult in reduced use of preventative and primary care services, particularly for\n\n       37\n          We acknowledge that the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby expressly declined to decide\nwhether the accommodation violated RFRA. Nonetheless, our analysis is consistent with the\nCourt’s dicta.\n\n\n                                            57\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 58 of 148\n\n\nlow-income populations.”); Dianne Greene Foster, et al., Number of Oral\n\nContraceptive Pill Packages Dispensed & Subsequent Unintended Pregnancies,\n\nObstetrics & Gynecology, March 2011, at 566 (concluding that when receipt of\n\noral contraceptives was made more convenient by dispensing them annually rather\n\nthan quarterly the unintended pregnancy rate dropped by 30% and the abortion rate\n\ndropped by 46%).38 Because the government has demonstrated that the mandate\n\nand accommodation increase access to contraception, we conclude that the\n\nmandate and accommodation are effective ways to reduce the unintended\n\npregnancy rate. Accordingly, they serve the government’s compelling interests of\n\n\n       38\n           The government’s evidence further shows that when contraception is easily accessible,\nwomen not only use it more often, they select more effective methods of contraception. In\nresearch studies, “when out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives were eliminated or reduced,\nwomen were more likely to rely on more effective long-acting contraceptive methods.” IOM\nReport at 109. These methods include intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, which are\nlong-lasting and have the additional advantage of not being dependent on user compliance. See\nBirth Control Methods Fact Sheet, Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., Office on Women’s Health,\nhttp://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-\nmethods.html (July 16, 2012) (showing that implants and intrauterine devices have a failure rate\nof less than 1 percent, compared to 5 percent for oral contraceptives and 11 to 16 percent for\nmale condoms).\n        These longer-acting contraceptive methods have been underutilized in the United States\ncompared to other developed countries where unintended pregnancy rates are lower, Jeffrey F.\nPeipert, et al., Preventing Unintended Pregnancies by Providing No-Cost Contraception,\nObstetrics & Gynecology, Dec. 2012, at 1291, in large part because they pose higher up-front\ncosts that discourage use. See IOM Report at 108. Evidence shows that women’s use of long-\nacting contraceptive methods easily can be increased by making the methods cheaper and more\nreadily available. In a study that provided intrauterine devices and implanted contraceptives at\nno cost to study participants, researchers found a significant decrease in unintended pregnancy\nand abortion rates in the study population. The study concluded that “[u]nintended pregnancies\nmay be reduced by providing no-cost contraception and promoting the most effective\ncontraceptive methods.” See Peipert, supra, at 1291.\n\n\n                                               58\n\f              Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 59 of 148\n\n\nimproving the health of women and children and assuring that women receive\n\nhealth benefits that meet their needs as well as the health care provided to men\n\ndoes.\n\n        Of course, a compelling interest alone is insufficient to satisfy RFRA; we\n\nmust also assess “the marginal interest in enforcing” the challenged law against the\n\nreligious adherents in question. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2779. “RFRA requires\n\nthe Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through\n\napplication of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular claimant whose\n\nsincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.” Gonzales v. O Centro\n\nEspirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 430-31 (2006) (quoting 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b)); see also Yoder, 406 U.S. at 221 (“Where fundamental\n\nclaims of religious freedom are at stake, however, we cannot accept such a\n\nsweeping claim [of compelling interest]; despite its admitted validity in the\n\ngenerality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks\n\nto promote . . . and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from\n\nrecognizing the claimed . . . exemption.”).\n\n        Yoder provides a good example of the application of this principle. There,\n\nthe Amish plaintiffs challenged Wisconsin’s law requiring high school attendance\n\nuntil the age of 16. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 207-08. The government asserted that the\n\nlaw was justified by a general interest in the virtues of universal education. Id. at\n\n\n                                          59\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 60 of 148\n\n\n213-14. The Supreme Court was unsatisfied with this interest as it applied to the\n\nplaintiffs. “[T]he evidence adduced by the Amish . . . [was] persuasively to the\n\neffect that an additional one or two years of formal high school for Amish children\n\nin place of their long-established program of informal vocational education would\n\ndo little to serve [the government’s stated] interests.” Id. at 222 (emphasis added).\n\n      Similarly, the government’s argument in O Centro exemplifies an overly\n\ngeneralized interest. The plaintiffs, a religious sect with origins in the Amazon\n\nrainforest, challenged the Controlled Substances Act’s regulation of hoasca, a\n\nhallucinogenic tea they used in religious ceremonies. The federal government\n\nargued that it had “a compelling interest in the uniform application of the\n\nControlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the\n\nhallucinogen can be made to accommodate the sect’s sincere religious practice.” O\n\nCentro, 546 U.S. at 423. The Supreme Court dismissed this slippery slope\n\nargument, which it said “could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an\n\nexception to a generally applicable law,” because it failed to consider the limited\n\neffect of an exception for the particular plaintiffs, and its stated need for universal\n\napplication was undermined by the existence of other exceptions. Id. at 435-36.\n\n      In contrast to Yoder and O Centro, here the government’s stated interests all\n\nconcern the law’s application to these particular plaintiffs. The government argues\n\nthat applying the accommodation procedure to the plaintiffs in these cases furthers\n\n\n                                           60\n\f              Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 61 of 148\n\n\nits interests because the accommodation ensures that the plaintiffs’ female plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries—who may or may not share the same religious\n\nbeliefs as their employer—have access to contraception without cost sharing or\n\nadditional administrative burdens as the ACA requires. Unlike the exception made\n\nin Yoder for Amish children, whom the Supreme Court found had an adequate\n\nsubstitute for additional formal education to refute the government’s compelling\n\ninterest, here the IOM Report’s findings of poor health outcomes related to\n\nunintended or poorly timed pregnancies apply to the plaintiffs’ female plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries and their children just as they do to the general\n\npopulation.\n\n      Moreover, the accommodation’s requirement that the plaintiffs inform their\n\nTPAs or HHS of their religious objection is essential to achieving the\n\ngovernment’s compelling interests. It ensures that a TPA is aware when it has an\n\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage so that the women covered by these\n\nplans can receive coverage if they want it, without gaps in such coverage. The\n\nnotification also guarantees that the Departments will be able to identify objecting\n\norganizations, like the plaintiffs, to make sure that the accommodation procedures\n\nwork (that is, to independently ensure that the women covered by the plaintiffs’\n\nplans are receiving the coverage to which they are entitled). Thus, the\n\ngovernment’s interests are sufficiently particular to satisfy the O Centro standard.\n\n\n                                          61\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 62 of 148\n\n\n                           (c)    The Exceptions to the Mandate and\n                                  Accommodation Do Not Undermine the\n                                  Government’s Compelling Interest.\n\n      The plaintiffs argue that the government’s interests in providing broad\n\ncontraceptive coverage cannot be compelling because the ACA provides\n\nexemptions from the mandate for other types of employers—namely, those (1)\n\nwith grandfathered health plans, (2) with fewer than 50 employees, and (3) that\n\nqualify as “religious employers.” We disagree.\n\n      First, the existence of grandfathered plans does not undermine the\n\ngovernment’s compelling interest in providing contraceptive coverage because\n\ngrandfathered plans are only a short-lived, transitional measure intended to ease\n\nthe burden of compliance with the ACA’s sweeping reforms. 78 Fed. Reg. at\n\n39887 n.49 (“[T]he Affordable Care Act’s grandfathering provision is only\n\ntransitional in effect, and it is expected that a majority of plans will lose their\n\ngrandfathered status by the end of 2013.”). To be grandfathered, a plan must\n\ncontinue to provide virtually the same benefits for the same percentage cost\n\nsharing as the plan had in effect on March 23, 2010. 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g)(1)(ii).\n\nIt becomes difficult to comply with these requirements over time. See, e.g.,\n\nSecond Am. Compl. at 23-24, No. 1:12-cv-03489, Doc. 56 (describing the Atlanta\n\nArchdiocese’s inability to afford to maintain its grandfathered plan past January 1,\n\n2014).\n\n\n                                           62\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 63 of 148\n\n\n       Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrates that the percentage\n\nof workers covered by grandfathered plans has rapidly declined: 26 percent in\n\n2014, down from 36 percent in 2013, 48 percent in 2012, and 56 percent in 2011.\n\nKaiser Family Found. & Health Research & Ed. Trust, Employer Health Benefits\n\n2015 Annual Survey at 218 (Sept. 22, 2015). 39 In addition, some employees\n\ncovered by grandfathered plans may in fact be receiving contraceptive benefits\n\nwithout cost sharing because, though not required to do so, their plans may include\n\nsuch a benefit.\n\n       As an additional consideration, we do not wish to penalize the government\n\nfor phasing in the ACA’s requirements to help businesses adjust to a new health\n\ncare regulatory landscape. Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 746 (1984)\n\n(“We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting\n\nreasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an\n\nunconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time. . . . The\n\nprotection of reasonable reliance interests is . . . a legitimate governmental\n\nobjective.”). Accordingly, even if the mandate and accommodation are phased in\n\n\n\n       39\n          We acknowledge that the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2015 data shows that 25% of\ncovered workers are enrolled in a grandfathered plan, which is not much less than the 26% in\n2014. But the Foundation reported that many employers were confused and unsure about\nwhether their plans remained grandfathered, suggesting that employers may have inaccurately\nreported that they had grandfathered plans. Kaiser Family Found., supra, at 214.\n\n\n                                              63\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 64 of 148\n\n\nover time, the gradual implementation is insufficient to undermine the\n\ngovernment’s compelling interest.\n\n      Second, the ACA’s treatment of employers with 50 or fewer employees as\n\nexempt from the “employer mandate” and therefore not required to provide\n\nemployees with health insurance at all, see 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a)(c)(2)(A), does\n\nnot undercut the government’s compelling interests. If, on the one hand, smaller\n\nemployers do not provide insurance coverage, then their employees must purchase\n\nhealth plans on the health insurance exchanges or face tax penalties. See id.\n\n§ 5000A(a), (b)(1). And plans purchased on the exchanges will include\n\ncontraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). If, on the other hand,\n\nsmaller employers choose to provide health insurance, then their plans are subject\n\nto the contraceptive mandate. See id. The employees of small businesses therefore\n\nwill receive contraceptive coverage regardless of whether their employers are\n\nexempt from providing health insurance. This exemption reflects a practical\n\nrecognition that small businesses have different financial realities from larger\n\nbusinesses. It in no way undermines the government’s interest in providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing because small businesses’ employees\n\nend up with health plans subject to the contraceptive mandate whether the\n\nemployers provide health insurance or not.\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 65 of 148\n\n\n      Third, the exemption from the contraceptive mandate for religious\n\nemployers does not weaken the government’s stated interests. Under the HRSA\n\nguidelines, the contraceptive mandate does not apply to a group health plan run by\n\na religious employer, defined by the regulations as “an organization that is\n\norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section\n\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). In finalizing the regulations, the Departments declined to\n\nextend the exemption to other organizations that have religious objections to the\n\nmandate because:\n\n      Houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to\n      contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than\n      other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the\n      same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other\n      people to use contraceptive services even if such services were\n      covered under their plan.\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39874.\n\n       The exemption for religious employers attempts to balance the need for\n\ncontraceptive coverage with our nation’s longstanding history of deferring to a\n\nhouse of worship’s decisions about its internal affairs. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 46623\n\n(“[T]he Departments seek to provide for a religious accommodation that respects\n\nthe unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in\n\nministerial positions.”); see also Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &\n\nSch. v. EEOC, 132 S. Ct. 694, 704-06 (2012) (describing history of non-\n                                          65\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 66 of 148\n\n\ninterference with internal affairs of houses of worship). The government\n\nundoubtedly has a compelling interest in respecting the values of religious\n\nemployers and their employees, and pursuing that interest does not undermine the\n\ngovernment’s equally compelling interest in improving women’s and the public’s\n\nhealth by making contraceptives easier to obtain. Especially with regard to\n\nsweeping legislation like the ACA, the government is often faced with competing\n\ncompelling interests. Courts may allow the government to balance those interests\n\nwithout undermining any individual compelling interest. See Hobby Lobby,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2780 (“Even a compelling interest may be outweighed in some\n\ncircumstances by another even weightier consideration.”).\n\n       We also reject the plaintiffs’ argument that the Departments’ distinction\n\nbetween houses of worship (which are exempted from the mandate) and other\n\norganizations with religious affiliation (which must seek an accommodation) is\n\nillogical. Although it may not universally hold true,40 it is a common-sense notion\n\nthat a church’s employees likely share more beliefs with the church than do the\n\nemployees of, for example, a school linked to that church, and therefore the\n\nemployees of a church that objects to contraception are less likely to use\n\ncontraceptive coverage even if it is available. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. Thus,\n\n       40\n         EWTN in particular argues that the Departments’ distinction between houses of\nworship and other religious organizations is illogical and does not hold for EWTN because, like\nemployees of “religious employers,” its employees share its religious convictions.\n\n\n                                               66\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 67 of 148\n\n\nthe Departments distinguished between houses of worship and other religious\n\ngroups using the readily available and well-established IRS tax status test. This\n\ntest is predictable for affected organizations and easy for the Departments to\n\nimplement. See United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 260-61 (1982) (noting it was\n\nreasonable for Congress to exempt self-employed Amish from Social Security\n\ntaxes because the exemption for “the self-employed provided for a narrow category\n\nwhich was readily identifiable . . . [and] distinguishable from the generality of\n\nwage earners employed by others”). We do not think that the Departments’\n\ndecision to exempt houses of worship based on a bright-line test while\n\naccommodating other religious organizations undercuts the government’s\n\ncompelling interests in enforcing the contraceptive mandate.\n\n      In sum, the mandate and accommodation further the government’s\n\ncompelling interests by ensuring that women have contraceptive coverage without\n\ncost sharing or additional administrative hurdles. Additionally, by requiring\n\norganizations that opt out of the mandate to identify themselves, the government\n\nensures that these organizations’ health plan participants and beneficiaries can\n\nreceive the coverage seamlessly through other channels. Although the government\n\nhas attempted to accommodate religious freedom as well as the needs of\n\nbusinesses, it has not done so in a way that undermines its goal of ensuring access\n\nto contraception.\n\n\n                                          67\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 68 of 148\n\n\n                    (ii)   The Mandate and Accommodation Are the Least\n                           Restrictive Means of Furthering the Government’s\n                           Compelling Interests.\n\n      As a final step, we must determine whether the mandate and accommodation\n\nare “the least restrictive means of furthering” the government’s compelling\n\ninterests. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). This test is “exceptionally demanding.”\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. The government must show “that it lacks other\n\nmeans of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the\n\nexercise of religion by the [plaintiffs].” Id. When a less restrictive alternative\n\nserves the government’s compelling interest “equally well,” the government must\n\nuse that alternative. Id. at 2782; see id. at 2786 (Kennedy, J. concurring)\n\n(considering whether alternative “equally furthers the Government’s interest”).\n\n      In determining whether potential alternatives to the mandate and\n\naccommodation equally further the government’s interests, we must consider both\n\nthe cost to the government and the burden the alternatives impose on the affected\n\nwomen. See id. at 2760 (majority opinion) (“[W]e certainly do not hold or suggest\n\nthat RFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation’s religious beliefs\n\nno matter the impact that accommodation may have on thousands of women\n\nemployed by Hobby Lobby. The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the\n\nwomen employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these\n\ncases would be precisely zero.” (emphasis added) (alteration, footnote, citation,\n\n\n                                          68\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 69 of 148\n\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 2760 (clarifying that the Court did\n\nnot hold that “corporations have free rein to take steps that impose disadvantages\n\non others or that require the general public to pick up the tab” (alteration and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). Because there are no less restrictive means\n\navailable that serve the government’s interests equally well, we hold that the\n\nmandate and accommodation survive strict scrutiny under RFRA.\n\n      Although the plaintiffs and the dissent suggest several potential less\n\nrestrictive alternatives to the mandate and accommodation, their proposals fail to\n\nachieve the government’s interests as effectively. Indeed, their proposals impose\n\nburdens on women that would make contraceptives less accessible than they\n\ncurrently are. Because these proposals cannot be expected to reduce the rate of\n\nunintended pregnancies and thereby improve the health of women and children as\n\neffectively as the mandate and accommodation, they do not qualify as less\n\nrestrictive alternatives under RFRA.\n\n      Previously, the Supreme Court and a member of this Court suggested that a\n\nless restrictive alternative would be to allow eligible organizations to notify HHS\n\nof their opt out, instead of having to provide Form 700 to their plan providers or\n\nTPAs. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807; Eternal Word Television Network,\n\n756 F.3d at 1349 (William Pryor, J., concurring) (“The United States, for example,\n\ncould require the Network to provide a written notification of its religious\n\n\n                                          69\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 70 of 148\n\n\nobjection to the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of requiring\n\nthe Network to submit Form 700—an instrument under which the health insurance\n\nplan is operated—to the third-party administrator.”). The Departments have\n\nresponded to and addressed this concern by revising the accommodation\n\nprocedures to allow eligible organizations notify HHS directly of their desire to opt\n\nout of the contraceptive mandate. 79 Fed. Reg. at 51094-95. With that potential\n\nalternative incorporated into the regulatory scheme, we turn to the alternatives\n\nproposed by the plaintiffs and the dissent.\n\n                             (a)     The Plaintiffs’ Proposals\n\n       The plaintiffs propose two less restrictive alternatives. First, they suggest\n\nthat the government could pay directly for all contraceptive coverage, in effect a\n\nsingle-payer system for contraceptives only, 41 either by creating a new government\n\nprogram or expanding an existing one.42 Either way Congress would need to pass\n\nlegislation that would fundamentally change how the majority of American women\n\n\n       41\n          In a single-payer system, the government—as opposed to employers, health insurers, or\npatients—pays for healthcare services. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 615; Single-Payer,\nMerriam Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single-payer (last\nvisited Feb. 12, 2016). Although the plaintiffs never call their proposal a “single-payer” system\nfor contraceptives, the label applies because they propose a system in which the government\nwould be the sole payer for contraceptives and related services. It is important to note that all\nother health care would continue to be provided through our existing system.\n       42\n          The plaintiffs suggest, for example, that Congress could expand Title X, which\ncurrently benefits only low-income families; patients whose income exceeds 250 percent of the\npoverty level must pay for any services they receive through Title X programs. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300a-4(c); 42 C.F.R. § 59.5(a)(8).\n\n\n                                               70\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 71 of 148\n\n\nreceive their healthcare coverage for contraception. 43 See Jessica C. Smith & Carla\n\nMedalia, U.S. Census Bureau, Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S.: 2014 at 3\n\n(2015) (55% of Americans had insurance coverage provided by an employer in\n\n2014). Among other things, adopting a single-payer system for contraception\n\nwould require Congress to squeeze insurance companies out of an entire segment\n\nof the health insurance business. 44 Second, the plaintiffs assert that the\n\ngovernment could provide tax credits to reimburse women for purchasing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 45 Under either the single-payer or tax credit proposals, all\n\ncoverage for contraception and related services would operate outside the existing,\n\nlargely employer-based, insurance system.\n\n\n\n\n       43\n           In Hobby Lobby, the government argued that RFRA does not permit the court to\nconsider proposals that would require the government to create entirely new programs as less\nrestrictive alternatives. The Court rejected this argument, explaining “we see nothing in RFRA\nthat supports this argument.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781. Accordingly, we consider this\nproposal even though it would require substantial congressional action to expand significantly an\nexisting program or create a new one.\n       44\n          We may, of course, consider the burdens that a proposed alternative places on\nnonbeneficiaries, such as insurance companies. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720-722\n(2005) (“[A]pplying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries. . . . Our decisions indicate that an\naccommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests.”).\n       45\n         The plaintiffs suggest the government could require women to purchase separate\ncontraceptive coverage on the healthcare exchanges and then offer tax credits to offset the cost of\npurchasing the coverage. This proposal would require Congress to amend the ACA because the\nexchanges are statutorily restricted to selling only full health insurance policies. See 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 18021(a)(1)(B), 18022(a), (b).\n\n\n                                                71\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 72 of 148\n\n\n       Most importantly, these proposals are not less restrictive alternatives\n\nbecause they would not serve the government’s interests “equally well.” 46 Hobby\n\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2782. As the Departments explain, these proposals would\n\ncause all women who have existing contraceptive coverage through group health\n\ninsurance plans to lose such coverage, forcing them instead to “take steps to learn\n\nabout, and to sign up for, a new health benefit.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888. Indeed,\n\nunder these proposals, women would have one employer-provided health insurance\n\nplan covering healthcare other than contraception. Then, they would have to take\n\nadditional, separate steps to secure contraceptives or contraceptive coverage.\n\nUnder a single-payer system for contraceptives, they would have to research the\n\nfederal entitlement for contraceptives and register for the program. Under a tax-\n\ncredit system, they would have to research plans offering separate contraceptive\n\ncoverage, select a plan, purchase coverage, and later file for a tax credit as part of\n\ntheir individual tax returns. 47 The mandate and accommodation present an easier,\n\n\n       46\n           We acknowledge dicta in Hobby Lobby suggesting as a less restrictive alternative that\nthe government pay directly for contraception; however, the Supreme Court did not hold that\nsuch a program was a less restrictive alternative. 134 S. Ct. at 2871-82 (“[W]e need not rely on\nthe option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations\nfail the least-restrictive-means test.”).\n       47\n           The tax-credit proposal is particularly problematic because it forces women to pay up\nfront for contraceptives in exchange for tax credits later. But many women simply would not be\nable to afford to wait a year for a refund from the government in the form of a tax credit and, as\nthe government’s evidence shows, would instead have to forgo using contraceptives. See IOM\nReport at 109 (recognizing that “cost-sharing requirements, such as deductibles and copayments,\ncan pose barriers to care and result in reduced use of preventive . . . services”); see also supra\n\n\n                                                72\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 73 of 148\n\n\nsimpler, and more certain path for women by ensuring that, by obtaining health\n\ninsurance, they also secure contraceptive coverage, even when their employers opt\n\nout.\n\n       Because plaintiffs’ proposals impose greater barriers to contraceptive access\n\nthan exist under the mandate and accommodation, their proposals likely will lead\n\nto lower rates of contraceptive usage (along with use of less effective forms of\n\ncontraception), meaning these proposals will be less effective at preventing\n\nunintended pregnancies and concomitant health consequences. 48 See IOM Report\n\nat 104-09; Foster, supra, at 566 (reflecting that when obtaining contraceptives\n\nbecame less convenient, the rate of unintended pregnancy increased); see also\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39888 (recognizing that these proposals would be “less effective\n\nthan the employer-based system of health coverage in advancing the government’s\n\ncompelling interests”).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ proposals would make contraception less accessible not only to\n\nwomen who currently receive contraceptive coverage through a group insurance\n\n\nnote 38. In contrast, the mandate and accommodation require women to pay nothing upfront for\ncontraceptives. Accordingly, contraceptives are significantly more available to women under the\nmandate and accommodation than they would be under the tax-credit proposal.\n       48\n          The two other circuit courts to address this issue have rejected similar alternatives for\nthe same reason. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 616-17 (rejecting similar proposed alternatives\nbecause they “would impede the receipt of [contraceptive] benefits”); Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d\nat 265 (holding that proposed alternatives “would not serve the government’s compelling interest\nwith anywhere near the efficacy of the challenged accommodation and would instead deter\nwomen from accessing contraception”).\n\n\n                                                73\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 74 of 148\n\n\nplan, but also to women who currently purchase health insurance through the\n\nexchanges, including women who work for an employer with fewer than 50 full-\n\ntime employees. Under the current framework, these women must research and\n\ncompare potential health insurance plans sold on the exchanges and then purchase\n\nand sign up for a plan. As a result of their efforts, they receive health insurance\n\nthat includes contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). Under the\n\nplaintiffs’ proposals, these women would still have to procure health insurance\n\nfrom the exchanges. But then they would have to take the additional steps\n\ndescribed above to obtain coverage for contraceptives. In other words, women\n\nwho currently purchase insurance through the exchanges would also face greater\n\nburdens accessing contraceptives under a single-payer system. 49\n\n\n       49\n          It is unclear whether our dissenting colleague advocates as a less restrictive alternative\nreplacing our insurance-based system with a single-payer system for contraceptive coverage. On\nthe one hand, the dissent never states that a single-payer system would be a less restrictive\nalternative, instead proposing that the ACA and ERISA need only a “slight[] tweak,” not the\njettisoning of our insurance-based system for contraceptives that a single-payer system would\nentail. Dissent at 137. On the one other hand, the dissent argues that the government should\n“provid[e] for contraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation’s administrative\nrigmarole” so that the government could “offer cost-free access to each and every woman in the\nUnited States.” Id. at 134. This sounds to us like a single-payer system.\n        Indeed, the dissent suggests that a single-payer system would be as effective or more\neffective than the mandate and accommodation at making contraceptives accessible to women.\nBecause under either system women pay nothing for contraceptives, to compare women’s access\nto contraceptives under the two systems, we must focus on the administrative burdens that\nwomen face under either system.\n        We conclude that, on the whole, women face fewer barriers to obtaining contraceptives\nunder the mandate and accommodation than they would under a single-payer system. Most\nsignificantly, most women covered by group health insurance plans and all who purchase\ninsurance on the exchanges seamlessly receive coverage under the mandate and accommodation.\n\n\n                                                74\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 75 of 148\n\n\n       After careful consideration, we conclude that the government has shown that\n\ncontraceptives would be less accessible—and used less frequently or effectively—\n\nunder the plaintiffs’ proposals then they are under the mandate and\n\n\nNonetheless, the dissent asserts that a single-payer system is a more effective way to improve\naccess to contraceptives because three categories of women whose employers are exempt from\nthe contraceptive mandate—(1) women employed by small businesses, (2) women covered by\ngrandfathered plans, and (3) women employed by churches or church-affiliated organizations—\nwould have greater access to contraceptives under such a system. See id. at 50. After\nconsidering these three categories, we remain convinced that a single-payer system would be less\neffective than the mandate and accommodation.\n        First, the dissent suggests that women whose employers have 50 or fewer full-time\nemployees would receive better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But, as we\nexplained above, these women receive contraceptive coverage under the mandate and\naccommodation regardless of whether their employers elect to provide health insurance coverage\nor they purchase a plan on the exchanges. See supra Part III.A.2.c.(i).(c). Given that these\nwomen currently have seamless access to contraceptives, we fail to see how this group supports\nthe dissent’s argument.\n        Second, the dissent asserts that women whose health plans have a grandfathered\nexemption would have better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But the\ndissent overlooks that the grandfathered exemption is a temporary measure, meaning the number\nof women covered by plans subject to the exemption has rapidly declined and should continue to\ndecline over time because it becomes more expensive for plans to maintain their grandfathered\nstatus. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g)(1) (requiring grandfathered plans to provide virtually the\nsame benefits for the same percentage cost sharing that the plan had in effect on March 2010).\nWe cannot say that a single-payer system serves the government’s interest as effectively or more\neffectively simply because in the short term a subset of women may have easier access to\ncontraceptives under a single-payer system.\n         Third, the dissent argues that women employed by churches and church-affiliated\norganizations would have easier access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. Even if\nthat is true for this relatively small group of women, the Departments have explained that these\nemployees are likely to share their employer’s religious objection to contraception, meaning they\nare “less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were\ncovered under the plan.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. All together, we cannot say that a single-payer\nsystem serves the government’s interest as effectively as the mandate and accommodation when\nwe consider that a single-payer system would impose greater barriers to accessing contraceptives\nfor most women who purchase health insurance from an employer and all women who purchase\nplans on the exchanges. What’s more, the balance tips even further in favor of the mandate and\naccommodation when we consider the impact of imposing on non-beneficiaries a single-payer\nsystem for an entire segment of preventative care. See Cutter, 544 U.S. at 720.\n\n\n                                               75\n\f                Case: 14-12696   Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 76 of 148\n\n\naccommodation. Given the government’s compelling interest in minimizing the\n\nbarriers women face in accessing contraceptives so that they will use\n\ncontraceptives to lower the rate of unintended pregnancies, we conclude that the\n\nplaintiffs’ proposals would not serve the government’s interest equally as well as\n\nthe mandate and accommodation. Thus, they fail to qualify as less restrictive\n\nalternatives.\n\n      The dissent criticizes our position as giving the Departments a “free pass” on\n\nthe least restrictive means requirement. Dissent at 139. Our dissenting colleague\n\ntakes our analysis to mean that the government can defeat a potential alternative\n\nmerely by showing that the alternative would take away a benefit—any benefit—\n\nthat the government’s existing framework provides to “third parties” (here, the\n\nwomen who are the intended beneficiaries of the mandate and accommodation).\n\nId. at 138. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying that the\n\ngovernment can always overcome strict scrutiny by showing that proposed\n\nalternatives would take away a benefit that the current framework provides.\n\nRather, on the facts and record of this case—including the evidence that when\n\nwomen face greater burdens (whether financial or administrative) in accessing\n\ncontraceptives or contraceptive coverage, they are less likely to use\n\ncontraceptives—we must conclude that plaintiffs’ alternatives, which make\n\ncontraceptives less accessible, would be significantly less effective than the\n\n\n                                           76\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 77 of 148\n\n\nmandate and accommodation at reducing the rate of unintended pregnancies and\n\nthus would thwart the government’s interests.50\n\n                              (b)    The Dissent’s Proposal\n\n       The dissent suggests that Congress could “slightly tweak” the ACA and\n\nERISA to “eliminate the need for eligible organizations to affirmatively designate\n\nthe third-party administrators of their health plans.” Dissent at 137. We\n\nunderstand the dissent’s proposal to be that Congress should pass legislation and\n\nthe Departments should enact regulations that would designate the TPA for a self-\n\ninsured eligible organization as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive\n\ncoverage without requiring the eligible organization to communicate its religious\n\nobjection to anyone.\n\n       The dissent’s proposal fails to serve the government’s interest equally as\n\nwell as the accommodation because the alternative would make contraceptives less\n\naccessible to women covered by eligible organizations’ plans than would the\n\naccommodation. The dissent fails to explain—and we cannot imagine—how a\n\nTPA would know when an employer has a religious objection to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the proposal and thus that the TPA is required to\n\n\n       50\n          The Eighth Circuit’s proposal that “the government could pay for the distribution of\ncontraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals with income-based\nsupport” likewise would impose additional administrative burdens on women and thus in a\nsimilar way fails to satisfy the government’s interests. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 945.\n\n\n                                               77\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 78 of 148\n\n\nprovide the coverage in the employer’s stead if the employer is not required to\n\nnotify anyone. Like the TPAs, the government must also be able to identify\n\nwomen whose employers object on religious grounds to providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage. Otherwise, the government will be unable to ensure that the participants\n\nand beneficiaries of the abstaining organization’s health insurance plan receive the\n\ncoverage the law mandates. Without an effective way to identify any gaps, the\n\ngovernment would be hamstrung in its ability to accommodate employers’\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs while also pursuing the interests that Congress\n\nintended to achieve in passing the Women’s Health Amendment. 51\n\n\n\n\n       51\n          The Eighth Circuit suggested as a less restrictive alternative that the Departments\nrevise the regulations governing the accommodation to remove the requirement that when\nnotifying HHS of its religious objection, an eligible organization must identify its TPA and\nprovide the TPA’s contact information. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 944. The Eighth Circuit\nconcluded that this alternative would be “less onerous” than the current regulations yet “permit[]\nthe government to further its interests.” Id. The Eighth Circuit relied on the fact that when the\nSupreme Court in Wheaton College created an accommodation, the Court required the college\nonly to notify HHS that it had an objection to providing coverage for contraceptive services, and\nnot to identify its TPA. Id.\n        We disagree with the Eighth Circuit that this alternative would serve HHS’s interests\nequally well. As the Departments explained, the information required under the regulations is\n“necessary for the Departments to determine which entities are covered by the accommodation,\nto administer the accommodation, and to implement the policies in the . . . final regulations.”\n79 Fed. Reg. at 51095. The Eighth Circuit has not explained why this is not so. Although the\nSupreme Court in Wheaton College did not require the college to identify its TPA to HHS to\nreceive an accommodation, the information was unnecessary because HHS already knew the\nidentity of the college’s TPA. See Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2815 (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting) (“HHS is aware of Wheaton’s third-party administrator in this case.”). Thus,\nWheaton College does not suggest that HHS could administer the mandate and accommodation\nin other cases without requiring an eligible organization to identify its TPA.\n\n\n                                                78\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 79 of 148\n\n\n       The dissent’s proposal would create gaps or delays in contraceptive\n\ncoverage for plan participants and beneficiaries of eligible organizations that refuse\n\nto provide contraceptive coverage or tell anyone of their objection. Until the\n\ninsured, the TPA, or HHS learned of the silent omission of contraceptive coverage,\n\nthese women would be denied the contraceptive coverage to which they are\n\nirrefutably entitled. During this period, such eligible organizations would, in\n\neffect, be imposing their religious beliefs on women who wish to take advantage of\n\ntheir rights under federal law. These gaps in contraceptive coverage would\n\nfrustrate the government’s interests. Because the dissent’s proposal substantially\n\nburdens religious exercise and fails to meet the government’s compelling interests,\n\nit cannot constitute a less restrictive alternative.52\n\n\n\n       52\n          We pause to note that if we assume that the dissent’s substantial burden analysis is\ncorrect—meaning the only objective inquiry for determining whether there is a substantial\nburden is the magnitude of the penalty, see Dissent at 116—then the dissent’s proposal would\nsubstantially burden the plaintiffs’ religious exercise. Presumably the dissent’s position is that\nthe proposal presents a satisfactory alternative because it requires no “affirmative participation”\nby the objecting organization. Id. at 139. In fact, though, a TPA’s obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage to a specific plan participant or beneficiary would remain tied to and—in\nsome limited way—“triggered” by actions taken by the organization. An eligible organization is\nrequired to take two actions before its TPA becomes obligated to provide contraceptive coverage\nto a specific plan participant or beneficiary: the eligible organization must (1) contract with a\nspecific TPA to provide administrative services for its plan and (2) notify the TPA of the\nindividuals covered by its plan. Unless an eligible organization hired a specific TPA and\nprovided a list of its insureds, those insureds would never receive contraceptive coverage from\nthe TPA, even under the dissent’s proposal. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 617 (explaining that\nunder a similar proposal when a university hired an unemployed person who “by virtue of\nbecoming employed by [the organization], obtained contraception coverage for the first time,”\nthe university’s acts would “‘trigger[]’ the new employee’s access to contraception”).\n\n\n                                                79\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 80 of 148\n\n\n       We hold that, even if the accommodation substantially burdens the\n\nplaintiffs’ religious exercise, it does not violate RFRA because it is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering the government’s compelling interests in the\n\ncontraceptive mandate.\n\n\n\n\nB.     EWTN’S Free Exercise Claims\n\n       Plaintiff-appellant EWTN additionally claims that the contraceptive mandate\n\nviolates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court’s\n\nSmith decision continues to apply to Free Exercise claims outside of the RFRA\n\ncontext; thus, neutral and generally applicable laws need not be justified by any\n\ncompelling interest even if those laws incidentally burden religious exercise.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 885. A law is neutral unless “the object of a law is to infringe\n\nupon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation.” Lukumi Babalu\n\n         The plaintiffs’ religious objections to taking acts that “trigger[]” contraceptive coverage,\n“facilitat[e]” access to contraceptives, or render them “complicit” in a scheme that provides\naccess to contraceptives apply with equal force to the dissent’s proposal. See EWTN Reply Br.\nat 5, 10-11; Catholic Charities and CENGI Appellee Br. at 10, 13, 20. Indeed, Catholic Charities\nand CENGI alleged in their complaint that their “religious beliefs prohibit them from contracting\nwith [a] . . . third-party administrator that will, as a direct result, procure or provide the\nobjectionable coverage to [their] employees.” Second Am. Compl. at 49, No. 1:12-cv-03489-\nWSD, Doc. 56. We acknowledge that the dissent’s proposal does not require an eligible\norganization to tell HHS or its TPA that it has a religious objection to providing contraceptive\ncoverage. But the plaintiffs do not claim that the government imposes a substantial burden by\nforcing them to state that they have a religious objection. Rather, they claim a substantial burden\nbecause, they assert, their objection would cause their TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n                                                 80\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 81 of 148\n\n\nAye, 508 U.S. at 533. And a law is generally applicable if it does not “in a\n\nselective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.”\n\nId. at 543. “A law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified by a\n\ncompelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that\n\ninterest.” Id. at 531-32. But if a law indeed is neutral and generally applicable,\n\n“then rational basis scrutiny should be applied, requiring that the plaintiff show\n\nthat there is not a legitimate government interest or that the law is not rationally\n\nrelated to protect that interest.” GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc v. Georgia, 687 F.3d 1244,\n\n1255 n.21 (11th Cir. 2012).\n\n      Congress included the contraceptive mandate in the ACA to improve\n\nwomen’s health and public health generally. There is no evidence whatsoever that\n\nthe mandate was enacted in an attempt to restrict religious exercise. To the\n\ncontrary, in implementing the contraceptive mandate the Departments have\n\nattempted to accommodate religious interests by granting exceptions for religious\n\nemployers and those organizations with religious objections to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. EWTN nonetheless argues that the mandate is non-neutral\n\nbecause the exemption and accommodation “discriminate[] among religious\n\nobjectors, creating a three-tiered system.” EWTN Appellant Br. at 54. But the\n\nregulations do not discriminate between religious denominations or infringe upon\n\nor restrict conduct because of its religious motivation. Rather, the procedures\n\n\n                                          81\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 82 of 148\n\n\ndistinguish among organizations on the basis of their tax status. Thus EWTN has\n\nfailed to show that the mandate is non-neutral.\n\n      EWTN also argues that the mandate is not generally applicable because the\n\nACA carves out small employers and grandfathered plans. For the same reasons\n\nwe rejected this argument as it pertains to the plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, we reject it\n\nhere. Just as these exceptions do not undermine the government’s compelling\n\ninterests justifying the contraceptive mandate, they do not prevent the mandate\n\nfrom being generally applicable as defined by Lukumi Babalu Aye. The exceptions\n\nfor small businesses and grandfathered plans apply equally to religious employers\n\nand non-religious employers. The exceptions in no way “impose burdens only on\n\nconduct motivated by religious belief.” Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 543.\n\n      Because the contraceptive mandate is neutral and generally applicable, to\n\ninvalidate it the plaintiff must show that is it not rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernment interest. See GeorgiaCarry.Org, 687 F.3d at 1255 n.21. EWTN\n\ncannot make such a showing. We have already concluded that the government has\n\na compelling (and therefore legitimate) interest in ensuring women have access to\n\ncontraceptives without cost sharing. See supra Part III.A.2.c.(i). The mandate is\n\nclearly rationally related to that interest and thus passes muster under the Free\n\nExercise Clause.\n\nC.    EWTN’S Establishment Clause Claim\n\n\n                                           82\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 83 of 148\n\n\n      EWTN next argues that the contraceptive mandate violates the\n\nEstablishment Clause by discriminating among religious organizations.\n\nSpecifically, EWTN objects to the way the exemption and accommodation\n\ndistinguish between houses of worship and other types of religious organizations.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Supreme Court “has long recognized that the government\n\nmay (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so\n\nwithout violating the Establishment Clause.” Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals\n\nComm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 144-145 (1987); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\n\nU.S. 38, 83 (1985) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“It is disingenuous to look for a\n\npurely secular purpose when the manifest objective of a statute is to facilitate the\n\nfree exercise of religion by lifting a government-imposed burden. Instead, the\n\nCourt should simply acknowledge that the religious purpose of such a statute is\n\nlegitimated by the Free Exercise Clause.”).\n\n      Like its claim based on the Free Exercise Clause, EWTN’s Establishment\n\nClause claim fails because the accommodation does not distinguish among\n\nreligious groups on the basis of denomination, but rather on non-denominational\n\nattributes of an objecting organization. The accommodation relies on tax status,\n\nwhich is a permissible way to distinguish between organizations for the purpose of\n\ndrafting a religious exemption. “[R]eligious employers, defined as in the cited\n\nregulation, have long enjoyed advantages (notably tax advantages) over other\n\n\n                                          83\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 84 of 148\n\n\nentities, without these advantages being thought to violate the establishment\n\nclause.” Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 443 (alteration in original and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Walz v. Tax Comm’n of N.Y., 397 U.S. 664,\n\n666, 672-73 (1970) (upholding a tax exemption on social welfare services that\n\nchurches performed and emphasizing that “[t]he limits of permissible state\n\naccommodation to religion are by no means co-extensive with the noninterference\n\nmandated by the Free Exercise Clause.”). We therefore reject EWTN’s\n\nEstablishment Clause challenge.\n\nD.     EWTN’S Free Speech Claim\n\n       Lastly, EWTN contends that the contraceptive mandate violates the Free\n\nSpeech Clause by compelling the organization to speak in order to avail itself of\n\nthe accommodation.53 “[T]he right of freedom of thought protected by the First\n\nAmendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the\n\nright to refrain from speaking at all.” Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714\n\n(1977). In Wooley, the plaintiff objected to the slogan on New Hampshire’s\n\nlicense plate: “Live Free or Die.” Id. at 707-08. He argued that by criminalizing\n\nhis efforts to cover up the slogan, the government forced him to express a message\n\ncontrary to his beliefs. The Supreme Court agreed that the license plate was forced\n\n       53\n          EWTN’s Free Speech claim that the regulations compel silence is moot because the\nDepartment removed the non-interference provisions from the regulations in 2014. 79 Fed. Reg.\nat 51095.\n\n\n                                             84\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 85 of 148\n\n\nspeech. The Court then applied United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), to\n\nhold that the government’s stated interest in identifying passenger cars was not\n\nsufficiently compelling because passenger cars could be identified in other ways.\n\nId. at 715-17.\n\n      Assuming, arguendo, that the act of filling out Form 700 or notifying HHS\n\nimplicates the Free Speech Clause, this Court must ask whether the government’s\n\n“countervailing interest is sufficiently compelling to justify” the forced speech. Id.\n\nat 716. Our disposition of the plaintiffs’ RFRA claims decides the issue. Because\n\nthe government has a compelling interest in ensuring that women have access to\n\ncontraceptive care without additional financial or administrative burden, it may\n\nforce the plaintiffs to speak simply to opt out of the mandate.\n\n                               IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n      We hold that the accommodation for the contraceptive mandate does not\n\nviolate RFRA because it does not substantially burden the plaintiffs’ religious\n\nexercise and because the government’s regulatory scheme is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering its compelling interests. The regulations also do not violate\n\nthe Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the First\n\nAmendment. With regard to EWTN, we affirm the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to the government. With regard to CENGI and Catholic\n\nCharities, we vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment on the\n\n\n                                          85\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 86 of 148\n\n\nplaintiffs’ RFRA claim and remand to the district court with instructions to grant\n\nthe government’s summary judgment motion.\n\n                                        ***\n\n      The question of whether the mandate and accommodation violate RFRA is\n\ncurrently before the Supreme Court in Zubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14- 1376 and 14-\n\n1377, and other consolidated cases. The Supreme Court will hold oral argument in\n\nthese cases on March 23, 2016. Because the Supreme Court will soon render a\n\ndecision addressing this issue, we believe it is appropriate to stay enforcement of\n\nthe mandate and accommodation against the plaintiffs until the Supreme Court\n\nissues a decision. Accordingly, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is\n\nenjoined from enforcing against EWTN, Catholic Charities, and CENGI the\n\nsubstantive requirements set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) and from\n\nassessing fines or taking other enforcement action against EWTN, Catholic\n\nCharities, or CENGI for non-compliance.

I write\n\nseparately only to emphasize one point already made in the opinion. Plaintiffs\n\nseem to suggest, as a less restrictive means, that a religious employer be allowed to\n\nopt out without notifying anyone – without requiring even the de minimis notice to\n\nHealth and Human Services (“HHS”) pursuant to the most recent alternative notice\n\nprovided for in the Regulations. However, the necessary consequence of such an\n\nautomatic opt-out would be the imposition of plaintiffs’ religious beliefs on their\n\nfemale employees. In other words, if HHS were not able to identify which\n\nemployers have opted out, the employees of such employers would not receive\n\ncontraceptive coverage, at least until they happened to sua sponte discover that\n\ntheir employer had opted out, and until such employees happened to sua sponte\n\ndiscover their statutory entitlement. Only then would such employees be in\n\nposition to notify HHS, and begin their coverage. Such an automatically exempted\n\nemployer – notifying no one of its decision to opt out -- would at least temporarily\n\nimpose its own religious beliefs on its employees and deprive them of the coverage\n\nto which they are entitled under the statute and regulations. RFRA does not\n\nrequire that construction of the law. Rather, the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby\n\nrecognized that “RFRA took the position that ‘the compelling interest test as set\n\nforth in prior Federal rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances\n\n                                          90\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 91 of 148\n\n\nbetween religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.’” Burwell v.\n\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 537 U.S. __, __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2785 (2014)(quoting\n\nfrom the express RFRA provision cited and quoted below). See also Cutter v.\n\nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 2121 (2005)(“Properly applying\n\nRLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\n\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries”); id. at 722, 125 S. Ct. at 2122-\n\n23 (“Our decisions indicate that an accommodation must be measured so that it\n\ndoes not override other significant interests . . .. We have no cause to believe that\n\nRLUIPA would not be applied in an appropriately balanced way.”). Indeed, RFRA\n\ncontains an express provision which incorporates the prior Federal case law\n\ncontemplating a “sensible balance” between religious liberty and competing\n\ngovernmental interests. See 42 U.S.C. §2000bb(a)(5) (“the compelling interest test\n\nas set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible\n\nbalances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.”)\n\nPlaintiffs’ position – and its necessary consequence of the imposition of plaintiffs’\n\nreligious views on others – clearly does not strike a “sensible balance” between\n\nreligious liberty and the government’s compelling interests in this case. See\n\nHobby Lobby, 537 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2786-87 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n\n(“[N]o person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or\n\nher religion.

Doing so, these parties sincerely believe, would make them complicit in\n\nviolating the sanctity of human life. As I understand RFRA’s plain meaning and\n\nthe controlling precedent, on full display in the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 189 L. Ed. 2d\n\n675 (2014), the answer should be straightforward. Under RFRA’s demanding\n\nscrutiny, the Government cannot put religious believers to the choice of\n\nabandoning the commands of their faith or paying massive penalties unless it can\n\nshow that it has no other way of achieving a compelling interest. Just as in Hobby\n\nLobby, the Government has failed to make this showing. We are therefore bound\n\nto grant Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses the relief they seek.\n\n      “Great cases, like hard cases, make bad law.” N. Sec. Co. v. United States,\n\n193 U.S. 197, 364, 24 S. Ct. 436, 468, 48 L. Ed. 679 (1904) (Holmes, J.,\n\ndissenting). In such circumstances, practical concerns “exercise a kind of\n\nhydraulic pressure” under which “even well settled principles of law will bend” as\n\n                                         93\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 94 of 148\n\n\na result of “some accident of immediate overwhelming interest.” Id. at 364, 401,\n\n24 S.

How can we most effectively expand healthcare access? When\n\nand where should the interests of society trump those of the individual? Who will\n\nbe left holding the check for any newly minted social-welfare programs?\n\n      It is Congress’s responsibility—not the prerogative of courts—to balance\n\nthese interests. And Congress made clear in RFRA how that balance is to be\n\nstruck: the freedom of religious exercise is to be jealously guarded by subjecting,\n\nacross the board, Congress’s own actions to the most rigorous scrutiny. Under that\n\nscrutiny, the Government’s attempt here to burden Eternal Word Television\n\nNetwork and the Dioceses’ religious exercise must give way. Concluding\n\notherwise, the majority makes bad law. For that reason, I dissent.\n\n                                        I.\n\n      The devil, as they say, is in the details. Nowhere does this adage ring truer\n\nthan in the administrative morass of the so-called “accommodation,” the regulatory\n\nmechanism by which religiously objecting employers can affirmatively opt out of\n\nthe Affordable Care Act’s so-called “contraceptive mandate.” The resolution of\n\nthis case turns on the exact functioning of an evolving set of overlapping and\n\nintricate regulations promulgated by three Executive-branch agencies. These\n\n                                         94\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 95 of 148\n\n\nregulations overlay a particularly unsettled and murky region of the generally\n\nunsettled and murky landscape of federal healthcare regulation. Therefore, it is\n\ncritical to get the details right. And they are devilish indeed.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“the ACA”),\n\ncovered employers, as part of their “[s]hared responsibility” for their employees’\n\nhealthcare needs, are required to provide qualifying employees with health plans\n\nthat meet certain standards of “minimum essential coverage.” 26 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 4980H(a), 5000A(f)(2). Covered employers who fail to do so have to pay a\n\n“tax” 1 of $100 per day for each affected employee. Id. § 4980D(a)–(b). For\n\ncontinued “noncompliance” after receiving a “notice of examination,” employers\n\nare subject to a minimum penalty in the amount of $2,500 or $15,000 per affected\n\nemployee, depending on whether the violations “are more than de minimis.” Id.\n\n§ 4980D(b)(3).\n\n        Included in the ACA’s definition of “minimum essential coverage” are a\n\nnumber of preventive healthcare services. Relevant here is the requirement to\n\nprovide “with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings …\n\nas provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources\n\n       1\n        It is ironic that the ACA refers to an annual penalty for noncompliance of $36,500 per\nemployee as a “tax.” Cf. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. __, __, 132 S. Ct.\n2566, 2593–2600, 183 L.

To develop these\n\nguidelines, the Health Resources and Services Administration, a subpart of the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, sought recommendations from the\n\nInstitute of Medicine, a division of the National Academies of Sciences. The\n\nInstitute of Medicine’s recommendations 2 were ultimately adopted in identical\n\nregulations promulgated by the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor,\n\nand the Department of Health and Human Services. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv).3 As a result, nonexempt employers are responsible for\n\nproviding their plan beneficiaries with coverage for “[a]ll Food and Drug\n\nAdministration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and\n\npatient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”\n\nWomen’s Preventive Services Guidelines, U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs.,\n\n\n       2\n          The Institute of Medicine’s recommendations were laid out in its report Clinical\nPreventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps, which was released on July 19, 2011. Like\nmuch of the ACA, that report and the process used to generate it sparked significant controversy,\nprompting public backlash and a dissent from one of the committee members.

Because I assume that the Government has a compelling interest in\nproviding the preventive services at issue in this case, I pass no judgment on the Institute of\nMedicine’s report or its contents.\n        3\n          As in the majority’s opinion, for convenience when discussing the Departments’\nregulations I will cite only those of the Department of Health and Human Services unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n                                               96\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 97 of 148\n\n\nHealth Res. and Servs. Admin., http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ (last visited\n\nFeb. 10, 2016).\n\n       These regulations, collectively known as the “contraceptive mandate,” did\n\nnot apply as enacted to several categories of employers. As is true generally of the\n\nACA, the contraceptive mandate does not cover employers with less than fifty full-\n\ntime employees. See 26 U.S.C. § 4890H(a), (c)(2). These employers are thus\n\nunder no obligation to provide any health plan at all. Similarly, employers who\n\nmaintain “grandfathered health plans”—health plans that have not undergone\n\nspecified changes in the way they operated before March 23, 2010, see 75 Fed.\n\nReg. 34538, 34540–41—are specifically exempted from the contraceptive\n\nmandate. 42 U.S.C. § 18011(a), (e). Other changes instituted by the ACA do\n\napply to grandfathered health plans, including extensions of dependent coverage\n\nfor adult children under the age of twenty-six and prohibitions on excessive\n\nwaiting periods, lifetime benefits limits, and rescissions of coverage. Id.\n\n§ 18011(a)(4)(A)(i)–(iv). The ACA does not include a sunset provision for\n\ngrandfathered health plans, which can continue their exempt status indefinitely. 4\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         The Government does predict that grandfathered health plans will be phased out over\ntime as part of a planned “transition period” designed “to avoid undue disruption.” It is\nultimately an empirical question how many grandfathered plans are currently in effect and how\nmany will persist in the future. The record developed in this case, as in so many other respects,\nbetrays no answer.\n\n                                                97\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 98 of 148\n\n\n       Conscious of the bind in which the contraceptive mandate would place\n\ncertain employers with religious objections, the Departments promulgated a series\n\nof further regulations to exempt these employers as well. 5 What emerged from\n\nseveral years of rulemaking were two distinct regimes for employers with religious\n\nobjections: one for “religious employers” and another for “eligible organizations.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a), (b). “Religious employers” are defined, by reference to\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code, as “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and\n\nconventions or associations of churches” and any “nonprofit entit[ies]” engaged in\n\n“the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” Id. § 147.131(a); 26\n\nU.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii).6 Employers who object to the contraceptive\n\nmandate but are not considered “religious employers” can still qualify as “eligible\n\norganizations” if they meet the following requirements:\n\n       (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of\n       any contraceptive items or services required to be covered under\n       § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account of religious objections.\n\n\n       5\n          The development of the current iteration of the contraceptive mandate—which has\nchanged multiple times since these suits was first brought, though not in ways that materially\nalter the RFRA inquiry—has been largely defined by how to treat religiously objecting\nemployers, inspiring hundreds of thousands of comments from interested stakeholders. See 75\nFed. Reg. 41726, 41726–56 (July 19, 2010); 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8725–29 (Feb. 15, 2012); 77\nFed. Reg. 16501, 16501–08 (Mar. 21, 2012); 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, 8456–72 (Feb. 6, 2013); 78\nFed.

In response to the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2751,\n189 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2014) and Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2806, 189 L.\nEd. 2d 856 (2014), § 147.131 now extends to cover qualifying “closely held for-profit entit[ies]”\nin addition to religious nonprofits, and expands the available methods of opting out of the\ncontraceptive mandate. Compare 45 C.F.R. § 147.131, with 45 C.F.R. § 147.131 (effective Aug.\n27, 2014 to Sept. 13, 2015), and 45 C.F.R. § 147.131 (effective Aug. 1, 2013 to Aug. 26, 2014).\nThe relevant portion of § 147.131 now provides in full:\n        (b) Eligible organizations. An eligible organization is an organization that meets\n        the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.\n                (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n        contraceptive items or services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n        on account of religious objections.\n                (2)      (i) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity\n        and holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n                         (ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held\n        for-profit entity, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the\n        organization's highest governing body (such as its board of directors, board of\n        trustees, or owners, if managed directly by its owners) has adopted a resolution or\n        similar action, under the organization's applicable rules of governance and\n        consistent with state law, establishing that it objects to covering some or all of the\n        contraceptive services on account of the owners' sincerely held religious beliefs.\n                (3) The organization must self-certify in the form and manner specified by\n        the Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n        Services as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The organization must make\n        such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request by the first\n        day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this\n        section applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person\n\n                                               99\n\f            Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 100 of 148\n\n\n      Religious employers’ and eligible organizations’ bids to remove themselves\n\nfrom the contraceptive mandate fare differently. Religious employers are simply\n\nexempt; they are not required to participate, directly or indirectly, in providing\n\naccess to contraceptive coverage to their female employees and beneficiaries,\n\nwhether or not these women share their employers’ beliefs. 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 147.131(a). Eligible organizations, in contrast, are required to affirmatively opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage, if they wish to do so, by complying with a\n\nfurther series of regulations known as “the accommodation.” Id. § 147.131(c).\n\n      How the accommodation functions turns on the eligible organization’s type\n\nof health plan. Broadly speaking, employer-sponsored health plans come in two\n\ntypes: insured plans and self-insured plans. Under an insured plan, the employer\n\nenters into a contract with an insurer. The insurer, in exchange for up-front\n\npremiums, becomes responsible for administering the plan and paying out claims.\n\nUnder a self-insured plan, the employer remains responsible for paying its\n\nemployees’ claims itself; in essence, the employer serves as its own insurer. For\n\nemployers with self-insured plans, it is a common practice to contract with a third-\n\nparty administrator—which may also be in the business of providing insured\n\nplans—to administer the self-insured plan, though the employer continues to bear\n\n\n      authorized to make the certification or notice on behalf of the organization, and\n      must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements\n      under section 107 of ERISA.\n\n                                             100\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 101 of 148\n\n\nthe cost of paying claims. 8 Eligible organizations that maintain their own self-\n\ninsured plans without a third-party administrator are, like religious employers,\n\nexempt from the contraceptive mandate altogether.\n\n       Eligible organizations may, in line with the regulations currently in force,\n\navail themselves of the accommodation in one of two ways. 9 The first option is to\n\nsend a “self-certification” form, Employee Benefits Security Administration Form\n\n700 (“Form 700”), to the eligible organization’s insurer, if the organization has an\n\ninsured plan, or to the organization’s third-party administrator, if the organization\n\nhas a self-insured plan. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b)(3), (c)(1). Form 700 requires\n\neligible organizations to identify themselves as qualifying for the accommodation;\n\nlist the name, title, and contact information of the person authorized to make that\n\ncertification; and sign and date the form. 10 The second option is to send to the\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services less-formal notice of the eligible\n\norganization’s intent to opt out. That notice must include “the name of the eligible\n\norganization and the basis on which it qualifies for an accommodation,” notice of\n\n       8\n          For example, Eternal Word Television Network has a self-insured health plan for which\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as third-party administrator. The Dioceses\ncollectively maintain three self-insured health plans, for all of which Meritain Health serves as\nthird-party administrator. Though Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama and Meritain Health may\nseparately offer insured plans, they are not responsible for paying the claims of Eternal Word\nTelevision Network’s and the Dioceses’ beneficiaries.\n        9\n          In the pre–Wheaton College iteration of the contraceptive mandate, there was only one\nway to opt out under the accommodation: submitting Employee Benefits Security\nAdministration Form 700 to the relevant insurer or third-party administrator. See infra n.11.\n        10\n           A copy of Form 700 is appended to the majority’s opinion.\n\n                                              101\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 102 of 148\n\n\nits objection to the contraceptive mandate “based on [the eligible organization’s]\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs,” the name and type of the eligible organization’s\n\nhealth plan, and the identity and contact information of the eligible organization’s\n\ninsurer or third-party administrator. Id. § 147.131(c)(1)(ii).\n\n      Under the first option provided for in the accommodation, whereby Form\n\n700 is sent directly to an eligible organization’s insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator, the recipient insurer or third-party administrator becomes\n\nresponsible for establishing separate contraceptive coverage for the eligible\n\norganization’s female employees and plan beneficiaries. The insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator must, upon receipt of the eligible organization’s Form 700,\n\n“[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage” from the eligible organization’s plan\n\nand “[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be\n\ncovered” pursuant to the contraceptive mandate. Id. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A)–(B).\n\nAmong other requirements, the insurer or third-party administrator must also\n\n“segregate premium revenue … from the monies used to provide payments for\n\ncontraceptive services” and is forbidden from “impos[ing] any cost-sharing\n\nrequirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impos[ing]\n\nany premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on\n\nthe eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or\n\nbeneficiaries.” Id. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). And the insurer or third-party administrator\n\n                                          102\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 103 of 148\n\n\nmust provide to plan members and beneficiaries written notice outlining how the\n\naccommodation works and “specify[ing] that the eligible organization does not\n\nadminister or fund contraceptive benefits.” See id. § 147.131(d) (proposing\n\nsuggested language for this notice).\n\n       Under the second option provided for in the accommodation, whereby less-\n\nformal notice is sent instead to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the\n\nSecretary is then tasked with alerting the eligible organization’s insurer or third-\n\nparty administrator. The Department of Health and Human Services will “send a\n\nseparate notification” to the insurer relaying that the eligible organization’s notice\n\nwas received and “describing the [insurer’s or third-party administrator’s]\n\nobligations.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(ii). The insurer’s or third-party\n\nadministrator’s obligations to provide separate coverage pursuant to the\n\ncontraceptive mandate are identical whether it is alerted to the eligible\n\norganization’s objections directly by Form 700 or indirectly by the Government. 11\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          The reason that eligible organizations are given two similar-seeming options for opting\nout of the contraceptive mandate stems from the Supreme Court’s decision in Wheaton College\nv. Burwell, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2806, 189 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2014). In Wheaton College, the\nSupreme Court enjoined enforcement of the contraceptive mandate against an eligible\norganization that sent written notice to the Government but objected, based on the organization’s\nreligious beliefs, to sending Form 700 to its insurer and third-party administrator. Id. at __, 134\nS. Ct. 2807. The Court did not address the situation presented here where an eligible\norganization objects, on religious grounds, both to completing Form 700 and to providing less-\nformal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n                                               103\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 104 of 148\n\n\n       The regulations require eligible organizations to affirmatively opt out of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate because doing so enables the Government to require the\n\neligible organizations’ insurers and third-party administrators to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. For eligible organizations with insured plans,12 opting out\n\nunder the accommodation notifies the insurers of their obligations to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i). For eligible organizations\n\nwith self-insured plans that contract with a third-party administrator,13 opting out\n\nof the contraceptive mandate under the accommodation makes the third-party\n\nadministrator “the plan administrator” for purposes of the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq., under regulations\n\npromulgated by the Department of Labor. 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). If the\n\neligible organization submits Form 700, that submission “shall be treated as a\n\ndesignation of the third party administrator as the plan administrator.” Id. If the\n\neligible organization instead provides less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health\n\nand Human Services, “the Department of Labor, working with the Department of\n\nHealth and Human Services, shall … provide notification … that such third party\n\nadministrator shall be the plan administrator” under ERISA. Id. Once a third-\n\nparty administrator becomes a “plan administrator” under ERISA, the relevant\n       12\n           Because this case does not involve eligible organizations with insured plans, I pass no\njudgment on the accommodation in that context.\n        13\n           As mentioned above, eligible organizations that administer their own self-insured plans\nare not subject to the contraceptive mandate under the regulations.\n\n                                               104\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 105 of 148\n\n\nadministrative agencies gain the regulatory authority to require the third-party\n\nadministrator to provide contraceptive coverage.14 Id. § 2510.3-16(c).\n\n       The Government’s regulatory authority to require third-party administrators\n\nof self-insured plans to provide contraceptive coverage is limited. A third-party\n\nadministrator may always decline to “agree[] to enter into or remain in a\n\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization.”15 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713A(b)(2). Only if it accepts the terms of the regulations does a third-party\n\nadministrator incur the obligation “to provide or arrange payments for\n\ncontraceptive services.” Id. § 54.9815-2713A(d). If a third-party administrator\n\nagrees to provide the contraceptive coverage, the costs it incurs to do so will be\n\nreimbursed from “Federally-facilitated Exchange” user fees, which are fees\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           Under ERISA, a third-party administrator that is neither the “plan sponsor” nor\nspecifically designated as such can be considered the “plan administrator” only “as the Secretary\n[of Labor] may by regulation prescribe.” 29 U.S.C. § 1002(16)(A)(iii). The Government\ncontends that, as currently written, the ACA’s implementing regulations also allow it to\nindependently enforce the contraceptive mandate against third-party administrators of self-\ninsured plans without any further action from the eligible organization. The truth of this\ncontention is far from certain. See ante at 44–45 & nn.30–31; Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Health and Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927, 935 n.8 (8th Cir. 2015) (collecting cases\ncontrary to the Government’s position). In any event, I decline to pass judgment on this question\nbecause its resolution is unnecessary to decide this case.\n        15\n           If a third-party administrator declines to provide contraceptive coverage, eligible\norganizations with self-insured plans must select another willing third-party administrator,\nadminister its own health plan, or become subject to the monetary penalties discussed above.\n\n                                              105\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 106 of 148\n\n\nimposed on insurers offering health plans on exchanges established by the\n\nGovernment under the ACA. 16 See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n                                               B.\n\n       Inextricably intertwined with these evolving regulations is a series of cases\n\nchallenging the various iterations of the contraceptive mandate under the Religious\n\nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. RFRA provides\n\nthat the federal government 17 “may substantially burden a person’s exercise of\n\nreligion” only if it does so “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest”\n\nand the burden it imposes is “the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.” Id. § 2000bb-1(b).\n\n       In 1993, Congress enacted RFRA in response to the Supreme Court’s path-\n\nbreaking approach to the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause taken in\n\nEmployment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494\n\n\n       16\n           Specifically, the regulations contemplate “adjustments” to the third-party\nadministrator’s own user fees, if the third-party administrator also offers health plans on a\nFederally-facilitated Exchange, or the user fees of another participating insurer that the third-\nparty administrator contracts with to receive reimbursement. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328. Third-\nparty administrators are to be reimbursed for the “total dollar amount of the payments for\ncontraceptive services” and an “allowance for administrative costs and margin” of “no less than\n10 percent” for the amount spent on contraceptive services. 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(3)(i), (ii).\nThe Government does not address how reimbursement will be made, if at all, should these user\nfees prove insufficient. Cf. King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2487, 192 L. Ed.\n2d 483 (2015) (noting that the ACA contemplates that each state will create its own exchange).\n        17\n           RFRA originally applied to the actions of state governments as well, but the Supreme\nCourt held that extending RFRA’s mandate to the states exceeded Congress’s powers under § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 138 L.\nEd. 2d 624 (1997).\n\n                                               106\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 107 of 148\n\n\nU.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1990) (holding that neutral laws of\n\ngeneral applicability do not burden free exercise whether or not they are supported\n\nby a compelling interest). Congress declared that the standard of strict scrutiny\n\nRFRA imposes creates “a workable test for striking sensible balances between\n\nreligious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000bb(a)(5). RFRA’s stated purposes included “restor[ing] the compelling\n\ninterest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin\n\nv. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972)” and “provid[ing] a claim or defense to persons\n\nwhose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.” Id.\n\n§ 2000bb(b)(1), (2). To the extent that it imposes a least-restrictive-means\n\nrequirement not present in Sherbert or Yoder, however, RFRA “provide[s] even\n\nbroader protection for religious liberty than was available under those decisions.”\n\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. __, __ n.3, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2761\n\nn.3, 189 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2014).\n\n        Following the enactment of the ACA and the promulgation of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate, a diverse set of employers brought suit to avoid providing\n\nwhat they viewed as objectionable contraceptive coverage. 18 The Supreme Court\n\n\n       18\n          Though the bulk of this litigation has been brought under RFRA, at least one non-\nreligious employer has challenged the contraceptive mandate under the Fifth Amendment. See\nMarch for Life v. Burwell, No. 14-cv-1149(RJL), 2015 WL 5139099 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 2015)\n(concluding that the contraceptive mandate violates equal-protection principles because it lacks a\nrational basis for discriminating between religious and non-religious objectors). Because this\n\n                                               107\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 108 of 148\n\n\nfirst encountered the contraceptive mandate in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores,\n\nInc., 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 189 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2014).19 The Court held in\n\nHobby Lobby that enforcing the contraceptive mandate against a closely held for-\n\nprofit company that had religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage\n\nwould violate RFRA. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2785. The Court began by\n\ndetermining that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, RFRA covers certain for-\n\nprofit companies because the term “person” was not limited only to natural\n\npersons. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2767–75. Moving to RFRA’s threshold inquiry,\n\nthe Court “ha[d] little trouble concluding” that the contraceptive mandate imposes\n\na substantial burden on religious exercise. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2775. The\n\nHobby Lobby plaintiffs had an uncontested “sincere religious belief that life begins\n\nat conception” and understood that their belief would be violated if they were\n\nrequired to “provid[e] health insurance that covers methods of birth control” that\n\n“may result in the destruction of an embryo.” Id. By forcing them to choose\n\nbetween violating their deeply held convictions and “pay[ing] an enormous sum of\n\nmoney,” the contraceptive mandate “clearly imposes a substantial burden on those\n\nbeliefs.” Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779.\n\ncase involves only employers with religious objections and is resolved by RFRA’s clear dictates,\nI decline to address the constitutional propriety of applying the contraceptive mandate to non-\nreligious objectors.\n        19\n           Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby, joined by Chief Justice\nRoberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas. Justice Kennedy concurred. Justice Ginsburg\ndissented, joined in full by Justice Sotomayor and in relevant part by Justices Breyer and Kagan.\n\n                                              108\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 109 of 148\n\n\n      The Court specifically and emphatically rejected any argument that the\n\nparticipation of religious objectors, by paying for contraceptive coverage, is\n\n“simply too attenuated” from the objectionable outcome, the destruction of\n\nembryos, to constitute a burden on religious exercise. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2777.\n\nSuch an argument, which “implicates a difficult and important question of religion\n\nand moral philosophy,” would “in effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are\n\nflawed”—and defining the scope of religious belief is a dangerous line-drawing\n\ninquiry “federal courts have no business addressing.” See id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2778 (“Instead, our ‘narrow function … in this context is to determine’ whether the\n\nline drawn reflects ‘an honest conviction’” (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind.\n\nEmp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 716, 101 S. Ct. 1425, 1431, 67 L. Ed. 2d 624\n\n(1981))). Moreover, the Court noted, if the contraceptive mandate’s burden were\n\nnot substantial, it would “be hard to understand” and “not easy to square” with the\n\nexemptions carved out for qualifying “religious employers” facing “exactly the\n\nsame” burden. Id. at __ n.33, 134 S. Ct. at 2777 n.33.\n\n      The Court next declined to address whether the contraceptive mandate\n\nfurthered a compelling interest because, even if it did, the contraceptive mandate\n\nwas not the least restrictive means of doing so. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779–80.\n\nThe Court identified several less-restrictive alternatives that the Government could\n\nhave used to achieve the assumed compelling interest, holding that the\n\n                                          109\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 110 of 148\n\n\ncontraceptive mandate foundered under RFRA’s “exceptionally demanding”\n\nstandard. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. The “most straightforward” alternative\n\n“would be for the Government to assume the cost” of contraceptive coverage. Id.\n\nat __, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. In response to the Government’s contrary position, the\n\nCourt observed that “it is hard to understand [the] argument that [the Government]\n\ncannot be required under RFRA to pay anything” for “a Government interest of the\n\nhighest order.” Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781. 20 The Court also strongly suggested\n\nthat the Government’s direct provision of contraceptive coverage would still be a\n\nless-restrictive alternative if the Government were required to create “an entirely\n\nnew program” rather than “modif[y] an existing program (which RFRA surely\n\nallows).” Id.\n\n\n       In its analysis the Court decided it “need not rely on the option of a new,\n\ngovernment-funded program” to identify a less-restrictive alternative because the\n\nregulations already provided one: the then-existing version of the accommodation\n\nfor employers with religious objections. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781–82. The for-\n       20\n           Requiring the Government to, at times, spend additional monies to avoid imposing\nsubstantial burdens on the free exercise of religious objectors would accord with RFRA’s sister\nstatute, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 2000cc, 2000cc-1. See id. § 2000cc-3(c) (“[T]his chapter may require a government to incur\nexpenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.”).\nCongress enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending and Commerce Clauses after the Supreme\nCourt in City of Boerne held that RFRA could not be applied to the actions of state governments\nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See supra note 17. The standard of RLUIPA mirrors\nthat of RFRA and applies in two contexts: land-use regulation and the religious exercise of\ninstitutionalized persons.\n\n                                              110\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 111 of 148\n\n\nprofit Hobby Lobby plaintiffs did not object to the accommodation itself, so\n\ngranting them the option for a third party to provide their female employees’\n\ncontraceptive coverage “serves [the Government’s] stated interests equally well.”\n\nId. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781–82. Though derided as “‘noncommittal’” by the\n\ndissent for doing so, the Court expressly declined to rule on “whether an approach\n\nof this type complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.” Id. at __ &\n\nn.40, 134 S. Ct. at 2782 & n.40.\n\n       Three days after it decided Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court again ruled on\n\nthe contraceptive mandate in Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct.\n\n2806, 189 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2014).21 In Wheaton College, the Court issued an order\n\nenjoining the Secretary of Health and Human Services, “pending final disposition\n\nof appellate review,” from enforcing the contraceptive mandate against an\n\nemployer that submits “in writing that it is a non-profit organization that holds\n\nitself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for\n\ncontraceptive services.” Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The parties disputed whether\n\nthe obligation to provide contraceptive coverage was “dependent” on submitting\n\nForm 700 to an insurer or third-party administrator. Id. The Court concluded in its\n\ntwo-page order that, because notice had already been given to the Government, the\n\n       21\n         Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Thomas, Kennedy, and Breyer joined the\nCourt’s decision in Wheaton College. Justice Scalia concurred without issuing a separate\nopinion. Justice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Kagan.\n\n                                             111\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 112 of 148\n\n\nGovernment “relying on this notice” could “facilitate the provision of full\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the [ACA].” Id. The Court ended its order by noting\n\nthat it “should not be construed as an expression of the Court’s views on the\n\nmerits.” Id.\n\n       After Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College, the federal courts were inundated\n\nwith cases posing the question presented here: whether RFRA provides relief to\n\nemployers with religious objections to the accommodation itself. Our sister\n\ncircuits are deeply divided. Like the majority, most circuits have concluded that,\n\nthough RFRA requires deference to adherents’ sincerely held religious beliefs, “an\n\nobjective inquiry” to determine whether a law presents a substantial burden reveals\n\nthat the accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on religious\n\nexercise. 22 Ante at 33–41; see also Catholic Health Care Sys. v.

The agencies ultimately determined that the Government had a compelling\n\ninterest in providing women with cost-free access to a wide range of contraceptive\n\nservices. In accordance with that determination, the agencies, through threat of\n\nlarge monetary penalties, mandated that certain employers must provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage to their female employees. Though Congress had already\n\nexempted some types of employers—those with fewer than fifty employees and\n\nthose with grandfathered health plans—the agencies decided that another group of\n\n\n\n\n                                        114\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 115 of 148\n\n\nemployers should be exempt too: churches and church-affiliated organizations, as\n\ndefined by already-existing definitions in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n      The agencies exempted churches and church-affiliated organizations from\n\nthe contraceptive mandate because the agencies understood that the contraceptive\n\nmandate would impose a substantial burden on many of these organizations’\n\nreligious exercise. As a result, churches and church-affiliated organizations may\n\nchoose what contraceptive coverage, if any, will be available in their female\n\nemployees’ health plans. No such exemption, however, was thought necessary for\n\nother organizations with similar religious objections, whether for-profit or\n\nnonprofit. After much public outcry and litigation, the agencies changed course.\n\nAt first, the agencies began offering an exemption-like option to certain nonprofits\n\nwith religious objections. In response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Hobby\n\nLobby, the agencies extended the same to for-profit religious objectors as well.\n\n\n      But the exemption-like option—the accommodation—did not truly exempt\n\nqualifying employers. Rather, it required qualifying employers to affirmatively opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage, shifting the obligation to provide the\n\nrequired contraceptive coverage to the employers’ insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator. Originally, qualifying employers had to opt out by sending Form\n\n700 to the insurer or third-party administrator responsible for the employers’ health\n\nplans, alerting the insurer or third-party administrator to its new obligations. After\n\n                                         115\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 116 of 148\n\n\nthe Supreme Court’s order in Wheaton College, the agencies also made available\n\nan option of providing less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices. Under this option, the notice is rerouted to the insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator, in lieu of the employer submitting Form 700 directly.\n\n      For employers that run self-insured health plans in conjunction with a third-\n\nparty administrator and are eligible for the accommodation, opting out of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate has the effect of designating the employers’ third-party\n\nadministrators as “plan administrators” under ERISA. Once so designated, the\n\nagencies can require a third-party administrator to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\nAbsent any affirmative action from the employer, third-party administrators remain\n\noutside of ERISA’s reach. Likewise outside of ERISA’s reach, and thus\n\neffectively exempt from the contraceptive mandate, are employers that run self-\n\ninsured health plans without a third-party administrator.\n\n      As a result, there are four discrete options facing employers like Eternal\n\nWord Television Network and the Dioceses, which operate self-insured plans and\n\ndo not meet the Internal Revenue Code’s definition for churches or church-\n\naffiliated organizations but nonetheless have religious objections to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. First, these employers can provide the objectionable\n\ncoverage in violation of their beliefs. Second, these employers can comply with\n\nthe accommodation and affirmatively opt out of the contraceptive mandate,\n\n                                          116\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 117 of 148\n\n\nshifting the obligation to provide the required coverage to their insurer or third-\n\nparty administrator, also in violation of their beliefs. Third, these employers can\n\ndrop their third-party administrators and assume the costs and responsibilities of\n\nrunning their own health plans. Fourth, these employers can do nothing and\n\nthereby become liable for annual fines of thousands of dollars per employee.\n\n      This case requires two determinations. First, does the regulatory scheme\n\ndiscussed above impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of Eternal\n\nWord Television Network and the Dioceses, which believe that opting out under\n\nthe accommodation would violate the sanctity of human life? If so, does the\n\nregulatory scheme nonetheless survive RFRA’s demanding standard of strict\n\nscrutiny? Because I conclude that the answers to these questions are yes and no,\n\nwhile the majority says no and yes, I dissent.\n\n                                         II.\n\n       The threshold inquiry under RFRA requires a showing that the Government\n\nhas “substantially burden[ed]” the plaintiff’s “exercise of religion.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000bb-1. First, a RFRA plaintiff must identify religious exercise that the\n\nGovernment is burdening. The allegedly burdened exercise “must be sincerely\n\nbased on a religious belief and not some other motivation.” Holt v. Hobbs, 574\n\n\n\n\n                                         117\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 118 of 148\n\n\nU.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 853, 862, 190 L. Ed. 2d 747 (2015).23 When determining\n\nthe content of a religious belief, including how and to what extent its attendant\n\nexercise may be burdened, we defer to the plaintiff’s understanding of what his\n\nfaith requires of him because “[c]ourts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.”\n\nThomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 716, 101 S. Ct. 1425,\n\n1431, 67 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1981). So long as a religious adherent has drawn a line\n\nbased on “an honest conviction,” “it is not for us to say that the line he drew was\n\nan unreasonable one.” Id. at 715–16, 101 S. Ct. at 1430–31.\n\n       Next, we must determine whether, as an objective matter, the identified\n\nburden on religious exercise is substantial. The existence of a substantial burden,\n\nwhich “can result from pressure that tends to force adherents to forego religious\n\nprecepts or from pressure that mandates religious conduct,” turns on whether the\n\nGovernment’s actions coerce a religious adherent to affirmatively violate his\n\nbeliefs. Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th\n\nCir. 2004). To be substantial, a burden must be “akin to significant pressure which\n\ndirectly coerces the religious adherent to conform his or her behavior accordingly”\n\nand must be more than “an inconvenience on religious exercise.” Id. For example,\n\na zoning ordinance that forces members of an Orthodox Jewish congregation to\n\n       23\n           Though Hobbs involved a claim brought under RLUIPA rather than RFRA, both\nstatutes impose the same standard for substantial burdens of religious exercise. See, e.g., Midrash\nSephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                               118\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 119 of 148\n\n\n“walk[] a few extra blocks” to attend services on the Sabbath is not a substantial\n\nburden when there is no “religious significance” as to a particular synagogue site,\n\nthough “walking may be burdensome.” Id. at 1221, 1227–28. In contrast, if the\n\nGovernment puts a religious adherent to the “choice” of incurring a “serious”\n\npenalty or “‘engag[ing] in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs,’”\n\nthen the Government “substantially burdens his religious exercise.” See Hobbs,\n\n574 U.S. at __, 135 S. Ct. at 862 (quoting Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573\n\nU.S. __, __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2775, 189 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2014) (second alteration in\n\nthe original)). And a burden is no less substantial if the burdened party “is able to\n\nengage in other forms of religious exercise,” if the exercise in question is not\n\n“compelled” by the burdened party’s religion, or if the burdened party’s belief is\n\n“idiosyncratic.” Id. at __, 135 S. Ct. 862.\n\n      Here, it is overwhelmingly clear that the contraceptive mandate imposes on\n\nEternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses a burden that the\n\naccommodation does not alleviate. Eternal Word Television Network and the\n\nDioceses assert a religious belief—which the Government does not contest is\n\nsincerely held—that both complying with the contraceptive mandate and opting\n\nout under the accommodation, which requires the third-party administrators of\n\ntheir health plans to provide contraceptive coverage, would make them complicit\n\nin violating the sanctity of human life. The Government burdens that belief by\n\n                                         119\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 120 of 148\n\n\nrequiring Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses to affirmatively\n\nparticipate in its regulatory scheme.\n\n       And it is equally clear that the burden imposed is substantial. The\n\nGovernment puts Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses to the\n\n“choice” of either (1) complying with the contraceptive mandate, to which they\n\nobject on religious grounds; (2) opting out under the accommodation, to which\n\nthey also object on religious grounds; (3) dropping the third-party administrators of\n\ntheir health plans and becoming de facto insurance companies, incurring\n\nsubstantial costs and diverting the focus of their religiously motivated operations;\n\nor (4) incurring millions of dollars in penalties annually. 24 Besides providing yet\n\nanother way for the eligible organizations to violate their religious beliefs, the\n\naccommodation does nothing to change the Supreme Court’s holding in Hobby\n\nLobby that the contraceptive mandate “clearly imposes a substantial burden on\n\nthose beliefs.” 573 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779. Eternal Word Television\n\nNetwork and the Dioceses must either violate their beliefs or incur massive\n\n\n\n       24\n          Should it fail to comply with the contraceptive mandate, Eternal Word Television\nNetwork would face annual penalties of up to $12,775,000 for its 350 full-time employees. See\nEternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec’y, U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 756\nF.3d 1339, 1341–42 (11th Cir. 2014) (William Pryor, J., specially concurring in order granting\ninjunction pending appeal). The Dioceses’ three health plans are collectively responsible for\nalmost 2,000 employees and would be subject to roughly $73,000,000 per year. See Roman\nCatholic Archdiocese of Atlanta v. Sebelius, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, 2014 WL 1256373, at *2\n(N.D. Ga. Mar. 26, 2014); 26 U.S.C. § 4890D(b)(1).\n\n                                             120\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 121 of 148\n\n\nmonetary costs. On its face, such a “choice” is not a choice at all. Rather, it is a\n\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise.\n\n      As I understand it, this straightforward application of RFRA’s substantial-\n\nburden test should end the matter. The majority thinks otherwise, reaching the\n\nwrong conclusion for two reasons. First, the majority fails to give proper\n\ndeference to Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses’ sincerely held\n\nreligious beliefs. Second, the majority mischaracterizes how the contraceptive\n\nmandate works by understating the critical role that the accommodation forces\n\nemployers to play in providing contraceptive coverage.\n\n      Before explaining why the majority fails to give RFRA its proper meaning,\n\nit is helpful to clarify how our understandings of RFRA’s inquiry differ. Exactly\n\nwhere we differ is highlighted below:\n\n\n\n\n                                         121\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 122 of 148\n\n\n   THE MAJORITY’S VIEW OF RFRA                 THE CORRECT VIEW OF RFRA\nStep 1: Does the plaintiff hold a sincere Step 1: Does the plaintiff hold a sincere\nreligious belief?                         religious belief?\n       —Objective determination                  —Objective determination\n\nWhat are the contents of that belief?

Though the majority purports to defer to these beliefs, its\n\ndeference is largely illusory. The majority begins by correctly observing that\n\n                                             122\n\f            Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 123 of 148\n\n\nRFRA’s substantial-burden inquiry “involves both subjective and objective\n\ndimensions.” Ante at 34. The majority continues on, also correctly, to observe that\n\n“courts must accept a religious adherent’s assertion that his religious beliefs\n\nrequire him to take or abstain from taking a specified action.” Id. The majority\n\nfalters, however, when it concludes that “it is for the courts to determine\n\nobjectively . . . whether the government has, in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of\n\nviolating their religious beliefs . . . or incurring a substantial penalty.” Id. at 36–\n\n37.\n\n      Contrary to the majority’s position, RFRA does require deference to\n\nreligious adherents’ determinations that their sincerely held beliefs are being\n\nburdened. “The narrow function of a reviewing court in this context” prevents\n\nunnecessary and improper judicial intrusion into highly sensitive matters of moral\n\nphilosophy or theology, Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716, 101 S. Ct. at 1431, and this\n\nunderstanding of the substantial-burden standard is confirmed by the Supreme\n\nCourt’s most recent religious-accommodation decisions. See Hobbs, 574 U.S. at\n\n__, 135 S. Ct. at 861–63 (granting an exemption to a prison’s grooming policy for\n\na Muslim inmate’s proposed “‘compromise’” that he be allowed to grow a half-\n\ninch-long beard); Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2775–79 (rejecting\n\nthe argument that “the connection between” providing contraceptive coverage and\n\n\n\n\n                                           123\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 124 of 148\n\n\nthe “destruction of an embryo[] is simply too attenuated” because this “would in\n\neffect tell the plaintiffs their beliefs are flawed.”).\n\n       The “objective inquiry” under RFRA focuses only on whether that burden is\n\nsubstantial. For example, courts must defer to a religious adherent’s belief, if it is\n\nsincerely held, that dancing is morally wrong.25 And courts must defer to the\n\nreligious adherent’s understanding that this belief would be burdened if she were\n\nrequired to look upon, even if only for a moment, a single masquerade ball or sock\n\nhop. What courts must determine as an objective matter is whether the burden\n\nimposed by any pro-dancing Government action is a substantial one. Imposing\n\nmillions of dollars in fines for failing to perform a Government-mandated jitterbug\n\nwould, obviously, be a substantial burden on religious exercise. In contrast, there\n\nwould be no substantial burden if the Government merely financed public\n\ndancefloors or had a hortatory policy of extolling the virtues of dance.26\n\n       If the substantial-burden test were as the majority believes it to be, federal\n\njudges would have to decide whether the burden itself substantially violated the\n\nadherent’s beliefs. That is, the majority would necessarily shift the gaze of its\n\n“objective inquiry” to the merits of religious belief. In this Bizarro World, it\n\n       25\n          Many faith traditions proscribe some or all forms dancing, including various\ndenominations of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.\n       26\n          Indeed, it appears that Congress has contemplated adopting such a measure. See H.R.\nRes. 667, 113th Cong. (2014) (as introduced in the House, July 11, 2014) (“Expressing support\nfor dancing as a form of valuable exercise and artistic expression, and for the designation of July\n26, 2014, as National Dance Day.”).\n\n                                               124\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 125 of 148\n\n\nwould be secular courts making ex cathedra pronouncements on whether Muslims\n\nare truly put out by requirements to shave their beards, Hobbs, 574 U.S. __, 135 S.\n\nCt. 853; Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v.

Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198\n\n(11th Cir. 2015), and whether the sacramental use of peyote is really that big of a\n\ndeal to members of the Native American Church, Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res.\n\nof Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1990). But, of\n\ncourse, the Constitution does not vest in the judiciary the authority to declare\n\nwinners and losers in matters of faith. And for good reason.\n\n      At bottom, the majority’s reasoning takes aim at the heart of RFRA itself.\n\nImplicit in the majority’s rationale is the notion that wily plaintiffs could game the\n\nsystem if religious adherents’ beliefs were given the full extent of the deference\n\ndemanded by RFRA. In tailoring their stated beliefs, these plaintiffs could engage\n\nin strategic litigation unhampered, impairing the government’s ability to function\n\nefficiently. By expanding the limited scope of the objective portion of the\n\n                                         125\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 126 of 148\n\n\nsubstantial-burden inquiry, the majority expressly seeks to avoid “reducing the . . .\n\nfederal courts to ‘rubber stamps.’” Ante at 37. Here, despite conceding as the\n\nmajority must that “the act of opting out plays [some] causal role in the ultimate\n\nprovision of contraceptive coverage,” the majority runs roughshod over the\n\nsincerely held religious objections of Eternal Word Television Network and the\n\nDioceses because, in line with the majority’s sense of things, the “de minimis\n\nburden that the plaintiffs face” resulting from their role as “an incidental cause of\n\ncontraceptive coverage being provided” does not constitute a substantial burden.\n\nId. at 44-45, 47. The majority through a nifty bit of legalistic legerdemain\n\nmanages to transform the subjective content of religious adherents’ sincerely held\n\nbeliefs into an objective question of federal law, undercutting the very deference to\n\nreligious exercise it purports to extend.\n\n      The majority’s not-so-veiled implication that, if given its full effect, RFRA\n\nwill be refashioned from a shield protecting the faithful into a sword wielded by\n\ncynical opportunists is troubling and at odds with RFRA’s fundamental respect for\n\nthe deeply held convictions that guide the daily lives of hundreds of millions of\n\nAmericans. As an initial matter, whether or not a belief is sincerely held remains\n\nan important part of RFRA’s substantial-burden inquiry. Courts are not, for\n\nexample, compelled to entertain challenges from such obvious farces as a\n\n\n\n\n                                            126\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 127 of 148\n\n\nhypothetical “Church of Marijuana and Pepperoni Pizza”27 or the satirical “Our\n\nLady of Perpetual Exemption.” 28 Separating the faithful sheep from the cynically\n\nopportunistic goats is well within our judicial capabilities.\n\n       Moreover, to the extent that granting exemptions for religious adherents\n\nwould impair the government’s ability to run programs and administer law\n\nefficiently, this is a feature of RFRA, not a bug. Congress made the clear policy\n\nchoice that protecting the individual right of free religious exercise outweighed the\n\ncosts imposed at the expense of administrative efficiency. And this choice—to\n\npreserve individual freedom by fettering the Government’s ability to act as\n\nexpeditiously as possible—is at the core of our foundational notion of limited\n\ngovernment. Permitting demonstrations in public parks, requiring police officers\n\nto secure a warrant before searching homes or seizing persons, and committing the\n\nGovernment to provide just compensation if it wishes to take private property all\n\nsurely hamper the Government’s ability to pursue countless other important ends.\n\nThese tradeoffs are the cost of liberty. And how best to balance these enhanced\n\n\n\n\n       27\n           Of course, people can and do sincerely believe that marijuana consumption serves a\nsacramental purpose. See, e.g., Olsen v. Drug Enf’t Admin., 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989).\n        28\n           See God bless John Oliver: late-night comedian forms his own church, The Guardian\n(Aug. 17, 2015), http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/17/john-oliver-last-week-\ntonight-mega-church.\n\n                                             127\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 128 of 148\n\n\nprotections against their added costs is exactly the sort of thorny policy decision\n\nbest left to democratically responsive legislators, not unelected judges. 29\n\n       The majority is hardly alone in its implicit rejection of RFRA’s core\n\npurpose. Striking the proper balance between the collective needs of society and\n\nthe individual freedom of religious exercise has been fraught with rancor and\n\nsectarian strife since time immemorial. Unsurprisingly then, the oft-embattled\n\nRFRA has proven a favorite whipping boy from all sides of the legal academy\n\nduring its twenty-three-year existence. See, e.g., Douglas NeJaime & Reva B.\n\nSiegel, Conscience Wars: Complicity-Based Conscience Claims in Religion and\n\nPolitics, 124 Yale L.J. 2516 (2015); Mary Anne Case, Why “Live-And-Let-Live” is\n\nnot a Viable Solution to the Difficult Problems of Religious Accommodation in the\n\nAge of Sexual Civil Rights, 88 S.

Rev. 249 (1995).\n\n\n\n       29\n           “[T]hat one legislature cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature” and,\nthus, “one legislature is competent to repeal any act which a former legislature was competent to\npass” is a foundational principle that “can never be controverted.” Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6\nCranch) 87, 135, 3 L. Ed. 162 (1810). RFRA’s protections are statutory, not mandated by the\nConstitution. Should it wish to do so, Congress remains free to alter the scrutiny to be applied to\nany particular law challenged under RFRA or to repeal RFRA altogether.\n\n                                               128\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 129 of 148\n\n\n      Judicial declarations that the sky will fall if exemptions were granted to\n\nreligious objectors in a pluralistic society as diverse and vibrant as the United\n\nStates are old hat as well. Consider the following statement of Chief Justice\n\nMorrison Waite, written almost one hundred and fifty years ago:\n\n      Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot\n      interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with\n      practices. … Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because\n      of his religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed\n      doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in\n      effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.\n      Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.\n\nReynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 166–67, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1878). After more\n\nthan a century of wrestling with the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, the\n\nSupreme Court brought constitutional religious-accommodation doctrine full circle\n\nin Smith, upholding without accommodation neutral laws of general applicability.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Scalia echoed Chief Justice Waite’s sentiment:\n\n      If the “compelling interest” test is to be applied at all, then, it must be\n      applied across the board, to all actions thought to be religiously\n      commanded. Moreover, if “compelling interests” really means what it\n      says (and watering it down here would subvert its rigor in the other\n      fields where it is applied), many laws will not meet the test. Any\n      society adopting such a system would be courting anarchy, but that\n      danger increases in direct proportion to the society’s diversity of\n      religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or suppress none of\n      them.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 888, 110 S. Ct. at 1605 (emphasis added). It is hard to fathom a\n\nplainer statement of the risks of reinstituting a policy of religious accommodation.\n\n                                         129\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 130 of 148\n\n\n      Yet it was against this very backdrop that Congress enacted RFRA in 1993.\n\nAnd Congress specifically declared that by adopting the demands of strict scrutiny\n\nit intended to depart from the less-protective constitutional standard announced in\n\nSmith. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(4). To the extent that the standard RFRA imposes\n\nraises policy concerns, criticisms on this front are best addressed to Congress, and\n\nmay find appropriate shelter in the pages of law reviews. But as federal judges we\n\nare duty-bound to follow and apply the laws Congress actually enacted, not as we\n\nmight wish them to be. “The wisdom of Congress’s judgment on this matter is not\n\nour concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written, and under the\n\nstandard that RFRA prescribes,” Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2785,\n\nthe accommodation, no less than the contraceptive mandate itself, imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise.\n\n                                            B.\n\n      Second, the majority fails to appreciate the crucial role in providing\n\nreligiously objectionable contraceptive coverage that the accommodation foists on\n\neligible organizations. The majority believes that the accommodation places no\n\nburden on the beliefs of Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses\n\nbecause the “significance they attribute to this act [of opting out]” is misguided,\n\nand thus the outcome of this case is not controlled by the otherwise-identical\n\nanalysis in Hobby Lobby. See ante at 42. According to the majority, “[t]he ACA\n\n                                         130\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 131 of 148\n\n\nand HRSA guidelines” are what “entitle women who are plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries covered by group health insurance plans to contraceptive coverage\n\nwithout cost sharing”—“not the opt out.” See id. at 43–44 . This is so even though\n\nthe majority “acknowledge[s] that an eligible organization’s act of [opting out]\n\nresults in the TPA’s designation as the plan administrator” under ERISA and “may\n\nbe an incidental cause of contraceptive coverage being provided.” Id. at 44–45.\n\nBoiled down to its bare essentials, the majority’s position is that if the parties really\n\nunderstood what is going on, they would have no basis to object to their role in the\n\ncontraceptive mandate’s regulatory scheme.\n\n       It is the majority, however, that misunderstands the contraceptive mandate.\n\nUnder its regulatory scheme, as bounded by the statutory requirements of the ACA\n\nand ERISA, 30 the Government becomes empowered to require contraceptive\n\ncoverage for an eligible organization’s self-insured health plan only if that\n\norganization affirmatively opts out under the accommodation. A third-party\n\nadministrator of a self-insured health plan “bears the legal obligation to provide\n\n\n       30\n           Some doubts have been raised as to the Government’s exact ability to require third-\nparty administrators to comply with the contraceptive mandate within the scope of its regulatory\nauthority. See Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927,\n941–42 (8th Cir. 2015). To the extent such doubts linger, they are of no moment here. “We\nneed look no further than to the government’s own litigation behavior to gauge the importance of\nself-certification in the regulatory scheme. If [third-party administrators] had a wholly\nindependent obligation to provide contraceptive coverage to religious objectors’ employees and\nplan beneficiaries, there would be no need to insist on … compliance with the accommodation\nprocess.” Id. at 942.\n\n                                              131\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 132 of 148\n\n\ncontraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a valid self-certification.”31 Wheaton\n\nCollege v. Burwell, 573 U.S. __, __ n.6, 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2814 n.6, 189 L. Ed. 2d\n\n856 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). The majority is\n\nincorrect, then, to say that the contraceptive mandate “does not turn on whether\n\n[an] eligible organization employer chooses to comply with the law.” See ante at\n\n44. Federal law kicks in only after an eligible organization acts; should an eligible\n\norganization decline to do anything, the Government lacks an independent means\n\nto ensure the provision of contraceptive coverage. Because the regulations\n\ncondition the provision of contraceptive coverage on eligible organizations’\n\naffirmative participation, their participation is the linchpin on which the\n\ncontraceptive mandate rests.\n\n       To draw an analogy with which any first-year law student should be well\n\nacquainted, an eligible organization’s opting out under the accommodation is both\n\nan actual and proximate cause of the provision of contraceptive coverage. There\n\ncan be no doubt that opting out under the accommodation is a “cause in fact” of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage. But for opting out, the Government would lack\n\nthe requisite regulatory authority over the third-party administrators of the\n\norganizations’ health plans. Cf. Stacy v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 54 N.W. 1091\n\n       31\n          Under the regulations currently in force, a valid self-certification is either Form 700 or\nthe alternative notice sent to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(b)(3), (c).\n\n                                                132\n\f            Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 133 of 148\n\n\n(Wis. 1893) (noting that without defendant’s cutting and removing of surface ice,\n\nuncontrolled horses would not have fallen through a frozen lake). The majority\n\ncontests whether the act of opting out also meets some standard of “legal” or\n\n“proximate” cause. See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 162 N.E. 99, 104 (N.Y.\n\n1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting) (“What we do mean by the word ‘proximate’ is\n\nthat, because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law\n\narbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. That is not\n\nlogic, it is practical politics.”). According to the majority, because federal law\n\nentails the authorization to require third-party administrators to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage, opting out is only “an incidental cause of contraceptive\n\ncoverage being provided.” See ante at 44–45.\n\n      I fail to see, however, how affirmatively opting out of the contraceptive\n\nmandate under the accommodation could be deemed anything other than a\n\n“substantial factor” or “material concurring cause” directly leading to the provision\n\nof religiously objectionable coverage. Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault\n\nSte. Marie Ry. Co., 146 Minn. 430, 436–37, 439 (1920). Opting out under the\n\naccommodation sets in motion a chain of events leading to the provision of\n\ncontraceptive coverage as inexorably as night follows day. 32 Once an employer\n\n\n      32\n        Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses object only to their own,\ngovernment-mandated participation under the contraceptive mandate. They do not—and indeed\n\n                                           133\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 134 of 148\n\n\nopts out, only then does the Government become authorized to regulate third-party\n\nadministrators. See Grace Sch. v. Burwell, 801 F.3d 788, 808 (7th Cir. 2015)\n\n(Manion, J., dissenting) (describing “the accommodation’s tangled mess” as “the\n\nlong and winding extension cord the government uses to power its contraceptive\n\nmandate”). So authorized, there can be no doubt that the Government will in turn\n\nflex its newfound regulatory muscle to require the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage.\n\n\n\ncannot—seek “to require the Government itself to behave” in accordance with their beliefs. See\nBowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 696–700, 106 S. Ct. 2147, 2150–52, 90 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1986)\n(denying relief to Abenaki man objecting on religious grounds to the Government’s “‘use’” of\nhis daughter’s already-issued Social Security number). The majority’s reliance on Bowen and its\nilk is, therefore, inapposite.\n         Likewise inapposite is the Majority’s analogizing the accommodation to the process used\nby conscientious objectors to opt of a military draft. See ante at 46. As Judge Manion puts it in\nhis thorough debunking of this familiar trope,\n         This is not like the case of a conscientious objector who objects and the\n         government finds a replacement. Under the regulations, the government does not\n         find the replacement, the nonprofit does. The designation does not take place\n         unless the nonprofit either delivers the self-certification form to its insurer or\n         TPA, or uses the alternative notice to inform the government who its insurer or\n         TPA is and which health plan is at issue. By insisting that the nonprofit deliver\n         the form or supply the plan information for the government's use, the government\n         uses the objecting nonprofit to do its dirty work. The government has not\n         provided an exit—it offers a revolving door with only one opening.\n         ...\n         This is not the case of a conscientious objector walking into the draft board,\n         voicing his objection, being excused, and walking out. For the analogy to fit the\n         HHS accommodation, the draft board must decide that every objector will be\n         replaced by the objector’s friend, and the objector’s objection is only effective if\n         the objector delivers written notice of his objection to his friend or tells the draft\n         board who his friend is and where the board can find him. Then, the objector\n         must send his friend money so that his friend will remain his friend for the\n         purpose of being his replacement.\nGrace Sch. v. Burwell, 801 F.3d 788, 812 & n.11 (7th Cir. 2015) (Manion, J., dissenting).\n\n                                              134\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 135 of 148\n\n\n       This clear and uninterrupted causal chain holds whether an employer sends\n\nForm 700 directly to its third-party administrator or submits less-formal notice\n\nindirectly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, just as a pilot reaches his\n\ndestination as certainly flying direct as with a layover. An employer connecting\n\nthese dots would hardly need the insight of Henry Friendly to conclude that its\n\nactions caused, in a direct and material fashion, the religiously objectionable\n\noutcome. “After all, if the form were meaningless, why would the Government\n\nrequire it?” Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Nos. 13-\n\n5368, 13-5371, 14-5021, 2015 WL 5692512, at *17 (D.C. Cir. May 20, 2015)\n\n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)\n\n       But this analogy can be stretched only so far. Common-law principles of\n\ncausation, however fundamental to our legal heritage, are simply too unreliable a\n\nlight to guide RFRA’s substantial-burden analysis. 33 Reading into RFRA some\n\nsort of proximate-cause limitation would reintroduce the exact same\n\n“attenuat[ion]” argument rejected by the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby for\n\n“dodg[ing] the question that RFRA presents.” 573 U.S. at __, 134 S.

To do so would be an illegitimate foray into the realm of personal faith, and\n\n       33\n           “There is perhaps nothing in the entire field of law which has called forth more\ndisagreement, or upon which the opinions are in such a welter of confusion [as defining\n‘proximate cause’].

Ct. at 1431. No matter how elaborate the Rube\n\nGoldberg machine the Government manages to jerry-rig, it is simply not our place\n\nto decide for Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses their degree of\n\ncomplicity when forced to topple the initial domino.\n\n      Accordingly, for eligible organizations that object to opting out under the\n\naccommodation, the contraceptive mandate burdens their religious exercise to the\n\nsame impermissible extent as the plaintiffs’ in Hobby Lobby.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      Concluding that the contraceptive mandate substantially burdens Eternal\n\nWord Television Network’s and the Dioceses’ religious exercise does not end the\n\nmatter. The Government can still prevail if it is able to show that the contraceptive\n\nmandate is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and the\n\naccommodation is “the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\n\ngovernmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b).\n\n      The Government fails to make this showing. For purposes of this opinion, I\n\nassume that the accommodation serves “a legitimate and compelling interest in the\n\n\n\n\n                                         136\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 137 of 148\n\n\nhealth of female employees.” 34 See Burwell v.

Ed. 2d 675 (2014) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\nThere is no need to reach the merits of this assumed compelling interest, whatever\n\nits exact nature, because the accommodation is not the least-restrictive means\n\ncapable of achieving any government interest that could conceivably be called\n\ncompelling. Accord id. at __, 134 S.

Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. __, __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2780, 189\n\nL. Ed. 2d 675 (2014). In codifying the familiar language of strict scrutiny—the\n\n“most demanding test known to constitutional law,” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521\n\nU.S. 507, 534, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 2171, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1997)—Congress erected\n\n\n       34\n           I pause to note my skepticism of the Government’s proposed gloss on the compelling\ninterest allegedly served by the contraceptive mandate. Providing “seamless” contraceptive\ncoverage—that is, providing coverage without cost sharing or additional administrative\nhurdles—and identifying organizations that opt out of the contraceptive mandate appear to me to\nbe derivative considerations of feasibility and administrative convenience rather than compelling\ninterests in their own right. As such, these considerations are better left to the least-restrictive-\nmeans prong of the RFRA inquiry.\n\n                                                137\n\f            Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 138 of 148\n\n\nRFRA as a mighty bulwark, entrenching against Government incursion the\n\nfreedom of religious liberty throughout the United States Code. To surmount these\n\nprotections, the Government has the burden of “show[ing] that it lacks other means\n\nof achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise\n\nof religion by the objecting parties.” Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2780. Carrying this burden is no mean feat. “If a less restrictive means is\n\navailable for the Government to achieve its goals, the Government must use it.”\n\nHolt v.

Of\n\ncourse there is. As the Hobby Lobby majority observed: “The most\n\nstraightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost\n\nof providing” the objectionable contraceptive coverage. 573 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct.\n\nat 2780. Though the Court did not ultimately need to reach the question of\n\nwhether direct Government provision of contraceptive coverage would constitute a\n\nless-restrictive alternative because the plaintiffs did not object to the\n\naccommodation, id. at __, 1354 S. Ct. at 2780–82, we must do so here. And I fail\n\n                                          138\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 139 of 148\n\n\nto see any reason why the Court’s persuasive reasoning should not be adopted.\n\nThe Government has not shown, as it must, that it would be able to provide the\n\nsame access to contraceptive coverage to the same women only if it can force\n\neligible organizations to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\n       Speaking bluntly, RFRA makes the Government put its money where its\n\nmouth is. I see nothing in RFRA’s text or the subsequent case law that would\n\nallow the Government to claim a compelling interest without having to spend a\n\nsingle red cent to do anything about it. Significant here, the Government must\n\nnecessarily agree that RFRA compels it to fund contraceptive coverage otherwise\n\nthe accommodation would not exist at all. Indeed, the entire purpose of the\n\naccommodation is to make the provision of contraceptive coverage independent of\n\nthe eligible organization, including segregating all the costs paid by the eligible\n\norganization from all the expenditures for the objectionable services. Aware of the\n\nfallacy of free-lunch thinking and absent any expectation of third-party\n\nadministrators acting out of purely eleemosynary impulse, the Government\n\ncommitted itself to funding contraceptive coverage for certain religious objectors,35\n\nalbeit in roundabout fashion.\n\n\n\n       35\n          Notably, the Government did not similarly commit itself to fund contraceptive\ncoverage for female employees of other employers with religious objections—either churches\nand church-affiliated organizations or eligible organizations that maintain self-insured health\nplans but do not use a third-party administrator. Nor did the Government commit itself to fund\n\n                                              139\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 140 of 148\n\n\n       To be clear, the Government is already committed to fund the contraceptive\n\nmandate under the current regulations. The Government reimburses third-party\n\nadministrators required to fund contraceptive coverage through a reduction in\n\nFederally-facilitated Exchange user fees, the amount of money paid to be able to\n\noffer insurance products on exchanges established by the Government under the\n\nACA. 36 Money is fungible; the Government finds itself in the same financial\n\nposition whether it declines to collect a tax liability of $500 or whether it collects\n\nthe $500 and then immediately refunds the same. By forgoing revenue to fund the\n\ncontraceptive coverage for the female employees of eligible organizations that opt\n\nout under the accommodation, the Government is effectively paying for the\n\nobjectionable coverage. And in contrast to the half-measure of the\n\naccommodation—which covers only a limited set of religiously objecting\n\nemployers and does not provide access to the female employees of churches and\n\nchurch-affiliated organizations, employers with grandfathered health plans, or\n\ncontraceptive coverage for female employees of employers with grandfathered plans or\nemployers with fewer than fifty full-time employees.\n         Though there may be some level of backstop coverage provided by the other provisions\nof the ACA and Title X, see infra n.36, the Government’s failure to extend its largesse to these\nwomen may also call into question the contraceptive mandate’s asserted compelling interest—\nwhich, again, I assume the Government would be able to show—but certainly raises an obvious\nquestion: If the Government is able and willing to pay for some women to receive access to\ncontraceptive coverage, why would it not be a less-restrictive means to do so in a more\nstraightforward manner for all women at risk of being denied such access?\n         36\n            As discussed above, third-party administrators may either reduce their own Federally-\nfacilitated Exchange user fees if they are also in the business of selling insurance or they may\nenter into a contractual arrangement with another insurer to recoup that insurer’s user fees. See\n80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n                                               140\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 141 of 148\n\n\nemployers with fewer than fifty full-time employees 37—providing for\n\ncontraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation’s administrative\n\nrigmarole would allow the Government to offer cost-free access to each and every\n\nwoman in the United States should it choose to do so. And the Government has\n\nfailed to shoulder its burden to show that it would be unable to grant women access\n\nto contraceptive coverage without the coerced involvement of Eternal Word\n\nTelevision Network and the Dioceses.\n\n       Again, this straightforward application of well-established legal principles\n\nshould carry the day. But, again, the majority thinks otherwise. Specifically, the\n\nmajority concludes that the current iteration of the contraceptive mandate has\n\nfinally hit upon the least restrictive means of achieving the Government’s\n\ncompelling interest when “the cost to the government” and “the burden the\n\nalternatives impose on the affected women” are taken into account. See ante at 63.\n\nThough I do not dispute that these concerns are relevant to the least-restrictive-\n\n\n\n\n       37\n          For female employees whose health plans are not subject to the contraceptive mandate,\nthe Government has stitched together a patchwork safety net under Title X and other provisions\nof the ACA. The record does not reveal how many women who would otherwise lack access to\ncontraceptive services are eligible for coverage under this makeshift framework. Nor does the\nrecord reveal whether there are hundreds, thousands, or millions of women who will continue to\ngo without such access, with or without the accommodation. Though a less-restrictive means\nneed not be a perfect means, strict scrutiny demands that the Government’s chosen solution must\nbe “neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive.” Brown v. Entm’t Merchants\nAss’n, 564 U.S. __, __, 131 S. Ct. 2729, 2741–42, 180 L. Ed. 2d 708 (2011).\n\n                                             141\n\f            Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 142 of 148\n\n\nmeans inquiry, I cannot agree with the majority that they save the contraceptive\n\nmandate from RFRA’s exceptionally demanding scrutiny.\n\n      The arguments advanced in the majority’s apology for the contraceptive\n\nmandate seem to rest largely on speculative and overblown logistical problems the\n\nGovernment might face if it were held responsible for furthering its asserted\n\ncompelling interest. According to the majority, if the Government were forced to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage “outside the existing, largely employer-based,\n\ninsurance system,” whether directly or through tax credits, “Congress would need\n\nto pass legislation that would fundamentally change how the majority of\n\nAmericans receive” contraceptive coverage specifically, if not healthcare\n\ngenerally. See id. at 66–67. Likewise, if forced to keep the current model of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage through eligible organizations’ health plans, “the\n\ngovernment would be hamstrung” because of the “gaps” in institutional knowledge\n\nthat would spring up regarding which female employees of which employers\n\nwould be covered by the Government and which are not. Id. at 72. As a result,\n\nbecause the majority believes that adopting any of the alternatives it considers\n\nwould incur various administrative and transactions costs, the result would be less\n\naccess to contraceptive coverage, undermining the Government’s asserted\n\ncompelling interest. See id. at 70–71, 74.\n\n\n\n\n                                         142\n\f            Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 143 of 148\n\n\n      The majority’s insistence on assuming a virtually immutable regulatory and\n\nstatutory status quo is fundamentally misplaced. RFRA makes clear that it is the\n\n“Government” that “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion,”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a) (emphasis added), not just constituent parts acting within\n\ntheir respective spheres of authority. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente\n\nUniao do Vegetal, for example, the Supreme Court specifically rejected the\n\nGovernment’s position “that the Controlled Substances Act is [not] amenable to\n\njudicially crafted exceptions [for the hallucinogen hoasca]” because of “the\n\nexistence of a congressional exemption for peyote.” 546 U.S. 418, 434, 126 S. Ct.\n\n1211, 1222, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (2006). It would be absurd to say, then, that we\n\ncannot grant a judicially crafted exception here because the relevant administrative\n\nagencies lacked the regulatory authority to promulgate exceptions that would have\n\nbeen equally effective in achieving an allegedly compelling interest had there been\n\ncongressional action allowing them to do so. In short, if the Government as a\n\nwhole has a less-restrictive alternative available, the Government must use it.\n\n      The majority’s radically revisionist account of RFRA, in contrast, would\n\nlimit the universe of less-restrictive means to what the Executive Branch can\n\naccomplish unilaterally by administrative fiat. This is a shocking reversal of our\n\nConstitution’s prime directive: “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be\n\nvested in a Congress of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. To the extent\n\n                                         143\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 144 of 148\n\n\nthat the Government claims an interest of the highest order, it is only reasonable\n\nthat Congress be expected to pitch in when freewheeling regulators encounter\n\nstatutory roadblocks. The practical hurdles to providing the access to\n\ncontraceptive coverage the Government seeks would simply disappear if Congress\n\nwere to slightly tweak the contraceptive mandate’s statutory authorization under\n\nERISA and the ACA. By having Congress eliminate the need for eligible\n\norganizations to affirmatively designate the third-party administrators of their\n\nhealth plans—thus becoming directly involved in the provision of the\n\nobjectionable coverage—the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and\n\nHuman Services would no longer need to substantially burden eligible\n\norganizations by putting them to the “choice” of affirmatively violating their\n\nsincerely held beliefs or paying massive penalties. And the Government has failed\n\nto show why this could be accomplished without imposing any additional burden\n\non female employees only if eligible organizations were required to use the\n\naccommodation. 38\n\n\n\n\n       38\n           To the extent that there may be additional administrative costs incurred in crafting an\nappropriately tailored exception to the contraceptive mandate, RFRA contemplates such costs\nand places them squarely on the Government’s shoulders. Even if the Government were to\nrequire female employees of exempt employers to fill out the sort of all-too-familiar paperwork\nassociated with receiving health insurance, such a “burden”—in contrast to being forced to either\nviolate a sincere religious conviction or face steep monetary penalties—would be, at most, “de\nminimis.” Cf. Catholic Health Care Sys. v. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207, 220 (2d Cir. 2015).\n\n                                               144\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 145 of 148\n\n\n      Finally, the fate of the contraceptive mandate under RFRA is complicated by\n\nthe Government’s decision to condition benefits flowing to third parties on actions\n\ntaken by religious objectors in violation of their beliefs. I agree that granting an\n\nexemption that would impose costs on third parties could, under certain\n\ncircumstances, run afoul of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. See\n\nCorp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v.\n\nAmos, 483 U.S. 327, 334–35, 107 S. Ct. 2862, 2868, 97 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1987) (“At\n\nsome point, accommodation may devolve into ‘an unlawful fostering of religion.’”\n\n(quoting Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 145,\n\n107 S. Ct. 1046, 1051, 94 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1987))). But such an eventuality alone\n\ndoes not automatically transform the Government’s chosen means into the least-\n\nrestrictive alternative required by RFRA. As the Supreme Court reiterated in\n\nupholding the constitutionality of RLUIPA, RFRA’s sister statute, “‘there is room\n\nfor play in the joints between’ the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses,\n\nallowing the government to accommodate religion beyond free exercise\n\nrequirements, without offense to the Establishment Clause.” Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n\n544 U.S. 709, 713, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 2117, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1020 (2005) (quoting\n\nLocke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 718, 124 S. Ct. 1307, 1311, 158 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2004)).\n\nGranting Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses an exemption from\n\n\n\n\n                                          145\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 146 of 148\n\n\nthe contraceptive mandate falls well within the space allowed for “play in the\n\njoints,” wherever those exact boundaries may lie.\n\n      Here, the Government is essentially asking for a free pass on RFRA’s least-\n\nrestrictive-means requirement because the administrative agencies responsible for\n\ncrafting the contraceptive mandate decided—for administrative convenience—to\n\ntie the provision of contraceptive coverage to eligible organizations’ affirmative\n\nparticipation in an elaborate regulatory scheme. If we were to honor the\n\nGovernment’s request, anytime regulators wanted to immunize their slapdash\n\nefforts, regardless of the potential alternatives, they need only condition a benefit\n\nto third parties on any substantial burden placed on religious exercise. Lest RFRA\n\nis understood to have ushered in the apotheosis of the administrative state, surely\n\nthe rigorous standard of strict scrutiny cannot be so easily evaded.\n\n\n      Without a doubt, there are sundry ways for the Government to provide\n\nwomen with cost-free access to contraceptive coverage. The administrative\n\nagencies tasked with promulgating the regulatory structure that undergirds the\n\ncontraceptive mandate chose, because of convenience and their bounded statutory\n\nauthority, to do so in a manner that substantially burdens religious adherents. We\n\nhave been presented insufficient evidence to hold that the goal of increasing access\n\nto contraceptive coverage could be reached only through the circuitous regulatory\n\npathways that have been cobbled together here. The Government, therefore, has\n\n                                          146\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 147 of 148\n\n\nfailed to carry its burden to show that the contraceptive mandate is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering any assumed compelling interest.\n\n                                                V.\n\n      The sweeping protections for religious exercise Congress contemplated\n\nwhen it enacted RFRA should not be denied to Eternal Word Television Network\n\nand the Dioceses. RFRA’s text and purpose, as confirmed by well-established\n\nprecedent, extend these protections to religious adherents forced to choose between\n\naffirmatively participating in a regulatory scheme that they sincerely believe would\n\nmake them complicit in denigrating the sanctity of human life and paying millions\n\nof dollars in noncompliance penalties. Because the Government cannot show that\n\nthe latest iteration of its constantly evolving “accommodation” survives strict\n\nscrutiny, RFRA bars enforcing the contraceptive mandate against those employers\n\nwhose religious exercise it substantially burdens.\n\n      By concluding otherwise, the majority diminishes the full range of religious\n\nliberty that Congress sought to protect when it enacted RFRA. Recasting and\n\nenfeebling RFRA’s standard as nothing more than “good enough for government\n\nwork” is a far cry from strict scrutiny’s typical charge of fiat justitia ruat caelum. 39\n\nPerhaps the majority’s desire to bring RFRA’s statutory protections for religious\n\nliberty closer in line with the less-demanding constitutional standard represents a\n\n      39\n           Let justice be done though the heavens may fall.\n\n                                               147\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 148 of 148\n\n\nsuperior policy judgment. Perhaps not. In any event, the majority’s application of\n\n“water[ed] down” strict scrutiny is exactly the sort of wishy-washy treatment likely\n\nto “subvert its rigors in the other fields where it applies” that motivated the\n\nSupreme Court’s Smith decision in the first place. See Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human\n\nRes. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 888, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 1605, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876\n\n(1990). But by enacting RFRA, Congress confirmed that strict scrutiny “really\n\nmeans what it says.” Id.; see also Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at __ n.3, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2761 n.3. Regardless of individual judges’ views of the wisdom motivating\n\nRFRA, that was Congress’s call to make.\n\n      Respectfully, I DISSENT.\n\n\n\n\n                                          148\n\f",

The government filed separate appeals from the two orders\nin Roman Catholic Archdiocese, which were consolidated before this Court.\n\n\n                                                3\n\f             Case: 14-12696         Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 4 of 148\n\n\nplaintiffs’ claims because we conclude that the regulations do not substantially\n\nburden their religious exercise and, alternatively, because (1) the government has\n\ncompelling interests to justify the accommodation, and (2) the accommodation is\n\nthe least restrictive means of furthering those interests.\n\n      Eternal Word Television Network (“EWTN”), the plaintiff in the first\n\nappeal, also raises several First Amendment challenges to the accommodation.\n\nBecause the accommodation is a neutral, generally applicable law that does not\n\ndiscriminate based on religious denomination, we reject EWTN’s challenges under\n\nthe Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. We also reject EWTN’s challenge\n\nunder the Free Speech Clause because, as discussed below, any speech restrictions\n\nthat may flow from the accommodation are justified by a compelling governmental\n\ninterest and are thus constitutional.\n\n                               I.       BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The Affordable Care Act and the Contraceptive Mandate\n\n      Enacted in 2010, the ACA requires group health insurance plans to provide a\n\nminimum floor of coverage without imposing cost sharing (such as deductibles,\n\nco-payments, or co-insurance) on plan participants and beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300gg-13(a). If an employer fails to provide such coverage in its group\n\nemployee health plan, it is subject to penalties in the form of a tax of $100 per day\n\nper affected person. 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b)(1). The Women’s Health Amendment\n\n\n                                              4\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 5 of 148\n\n\nto the ACA added to the minimum coverage requirements a mandate that group\n\nhealth plans provide women with coverage for preventive care and screenings.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). The requirement was intended in part to “get[] rid of,\n\nor minimiz[e], high copays and high deductibles that are often overwhelming\n\nhurdles for women to access screening programs.” 155 Cong. Rec. S11987 (Nov.\n\n30, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski). The ACA tasked the Health Resources\n\nand Services Administration (“HRSA”), an agency of the Department of Health\n\nand Human Services (“HHS”), with promulgating comprehensive guidelines\n\ndetermining which preventive services and screenings would be required.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). HHS commissioned the Institute of Medicine\n\n(“IOM”) to assist with HRSA’s development of the guidelines.\n\n      The IOM released a full report in 2011 detailing its study of various\n\npreventive services and its recommendations for coverage under the mandate. Inst.\n\nof Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011)\n\n(“IOM Report”). The IOM Report discussed at length the positive public health\n\noutcomes associated with reducing unintended pregnancies and giving women\n\nmore control over birth spacing. The United States has a much higher rate of\n\nunintended pregnancies—49 percent of pregnancies in 2001—than other\n\ndeveloped countries. Id. at 102. Unintended pregnancies correlate with health\n\nproblems both for women who experience such pregnancies and for children born\n\n\n                                         5\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 6 of 148\n\n\nas a result of them. Id. at 103. And because women may not realize immediately\n\nthat they are pregnant, “their entry into prenatal care may be delayed[;] they may\n\nnot be motivated to discontinue behaviors that present risks for the developing\n\nfetus; and they may experience depression, anxiety, or other conditions.” Id.\n\nUnintended pregnancies also frequently end in abortion. Id. at 102.2\n\n       The IOM Report also noted the health consequences of pregnancies\n\noccurring too closely together in time. For infants, “[s]hort interpregnancy\n\nintervals in particular have been associated with low birth weight, prematurity, and\n\nsmall for gestational age births.” Id. at 103. For women, both pregnancy spacing\n\nand the ability to avoid pregnancy may significantly affect their health because,\n\namong other reasons, some “women with certain chronic medical conditions (e.g.,\n\ndiabetes and obesity) may need to postpone pregnancy until appropriate weight\n\nloss or glycemic control has been achieved.” Id. Pregnancy is also contraindicated\n\nfor some women with serious medical conditions, for example, pulmonary\n\nhypertension or Marfan syndrome. 3 Id. at 103-04. The IOM Report also found\n\n\n       2\n         A 2013 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 18\npercent of all pregnancies in the United States ended in abortion and noted that “unintended\npregnancy precedes nearly all abortions.” Karen Pazol, et al., Centers for Disease Control &\nPrevention, Abortion Surveillance—United States, 2010 (Nov. 29, 2013),\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6208a1.htm. The IOM Report noted that in\n2001, 42 percent of unintended pregnancies in the United States were terminated by abortion.\nIOM Report at 102.\n       3\n        Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue.\nPregnancy can be difficult for women with the condition because of the additional strain\n\n\n                                               6\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 7 of 148\n\n\nthat “greater use of contraception within the population produces lower unintended\n\npregnancy and abortion rates nationally.” Id. at 105.\n\n       Pursuant to its statutory authority, HRSA released binding guidelines, based\n\non the IOM Report, that require coverage for “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration\n\napproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education\n\nand counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.” U.S. Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., Health Res. & Servs. Admin., Women’s Preventive Services\n\nGuidelines (“HRSA guidelines”), http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (last\n\nvisited Feb. 12, 2016); see also 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8725-26 (Feb. 15, 2012)\n\n(quoting the language in the HRSA guidelines regarding coverage). Implementing\n\nregulations developed by the Department of Labor, the Department of the\n\nTreasury, and HHS (collectively, the “Departments”) reiterate the contraceptive\n\nmandate’s requirement that health plans cover all services listed in the HRSA\n\nguidelines. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Treasury Regulation); 29 C.F.R\n\n§ 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Labor Regulation); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n\n(HHS Regulation).4\n\n\npregnancy places on the cardiovascular system. Nat’l Heart, Lung, & Blood Inst., What is\nMarfan Syndrome? (Oct. 1, 2010), http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/mar/.\n       4\n          The Departments have jointly developed regulations carrying out the ACA. To be\nconcise, whenever possible we cite only to the regulations issued by HHS, codified at 45 C.F.R.\npt. 147, and not to the corresponding identical regulations issued by the Departments of Labor\nand the Treasury.\n\n\n                                               7\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 8 of 148\n\n\n      Mindful of religious freedom and the importance of respect for “the unique\n\nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial\n\npositions,” the Departments promulgated interim regulations that gave HRSA\n\ndiscretion to exempt from the contraceptive mandate certain group health plans\n\nestablished or maintained by religious employers. See 76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46623\n\n(Aug. 3, 2011). The Departments defined “religious employer” by incorporating\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service’s definition of a church or integrated auxiliary from\n\n26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) and (iii). 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B) (2011).\n\nThe definition also required a religious employer to have a religious purpose and to\n\nboth serve and employ primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the\n\norganization. Id. Exercising the discretion the regulations provided, HRSA\n\namended its guidelines to exempt religious employers from the contraceptive\n\nmandate. The guidelines, issued on August 1, 2011, required compliance\n\nbeginning on August 1, 2012. See id. § 147.130(b)(1).\n\n      The Departments finalized the implementing regulations in February 2012.\n\nSee 77 Fed. Reg. 8725. At the same time, the Departments established a temporary\n\nsafe harbor from the contraceptive mandate for nonprofit organizations with\n\nreligious objections to providing contraceptive coverage. See Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain\n\nEmployers, Health Plans & Group Health Insurance Issuers with Respect to the\n\n\n                                         8\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 9 of 148\n\n\nRequirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing (Feb. 10,\n\n2012). The safe harbor remained in effect for the 2012 plan year, ending on\n\nAugust 1, 2013. See id. at 2.\n\n      The Departments intended to use the safe harbor period to “expeditiously\n\ndevelop and propose changes to the final regulations implementing” the\n\ncontraceptive mandate. 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503 (Mar. 21, 2012). The changes\n\nto the regulations needed to “meet two goals—accommodating non-exempt, non-\n\nprofit religious organizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive\n\nservices and assuring that participants and beneficiaries covered under such\n\norganizations’ plans receive contraceptive coverage without cost sharing.” Id. In\n\nMarch 2012, the Departments began the rulemaking process and solicited\n\ncomments on potential regulations that could achieve these two goals. Id. at\n\n16501.\n\n      At the conclusion of the rulemaking process in July 2013, the Departments\n\npromulgated revised regulations that retained HRSA’s authority to exempt\n\nreligious employers. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39870 (July 2, 2013). The same day,\n\nHRSA released revised guidelines that tracked the Departments’ changes to the\n\nreligious employer exemption. The final regulations simplified the definition of a\n\n“religious employer,” making the term coextensive with the IRS’s statutory\n\ndefinition and removing the additional qualifications regarding a religious\n\n\n                                          9\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 10 of 148\n\n\nemployer’s mission, programs, and employees. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) (2013); see\n\nalso 78 Fed. Reg. at 39873-74. Religious employers remained categorically\n\nexempt from the contraceptive mandate out of “respect [for] the religious interests\n\nof houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. The\n\nDepartments noted that the exemption did not undermine their goal of making\n\ncontraceptive coverage available because religious employers and their integrated\n\nauxiliaries “are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same\n\nfaith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than\n\nother people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under\n\ntheir plan.” Id.\n\n      The revised regulations, which took effect on Aug. 1, 2013, added an\n\naccommodation for organizations that do not qualify as religious employers under\n\nthe exemption. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b) (2013). So long as an organization is a\n\nnonprofit entity holding itself out as a religious organization and has a religious\n\nobjection to providing contraceptive coverage (we refer to such entities as “eligible\n\norganizations”), it may opt out of the contraceptive mandate. Id. 5\n\n\n      5\n          Under 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b), an organization is eligible for the accommodation if:\n      (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n      contraceptive items or services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n      on account of religious objections.\n      (2)     (i) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and\n      holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                 Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 11 of 148\n\n\n        Eligible organizations can take advantage of the accommodation via one of\n\ntwo procedures. The first procedure requires the organization to complete\n\nEmployee Benefits Security Administration Form 700 (“Form 700”). See EBSA\n\nForm 700–Certification (Aug. 2014),\n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc.\n6\n    To complete the two-page form, the eligible organization must provide its name\n\nand the name, title, and contact information of the individual signing the form on\n\nbehalf of the organization. The person signing the form must certify that the\n\norganization “has a religious objection to providing coverage for some or all of any\n\ncontraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                (ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held for-profit\n        entity, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the organization’s\n        highest governing body (such as its board of directors, board of trustees, or\n        owners, if managed directly by its owners) has adopted a resolution or similar\n        action, under the organization’s applicable rules of governance and consistent\n        with state law, establishing that it objects to covering some or all of the\n        contraceptive services on account of the owners’ sincerely held religious beliefs.\n        (3) The organization must self-certify in the form and manner specified by the\n        Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n        Services as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The organization must\n        make such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request by\n        the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of\n        this section applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person\n        authorized to make the certification or notice on behalf of the organization, and\n        must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements\n        under section 107 of ERISA.\n        6\n            Form 700 is included as the appendix to this opinion.\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 12 of 148\n\n\n       The form’s recipient depends on the type of health plan the eligible\n\norganization maintains. Employers can provide health benefits either through an\n\ninsured health plan or a self-insured health plan.7 See Cong. Budget Office, Key\n\nIssues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals 6 (2008). If the eligible\n\norganization has an insured plan, it gives Form 700 to the insurance company that\n\nprovides its health plan (“plan provider”); if the organization has a self-insured\n\nplan, it gives Form 700 to its third-party administrator (“TPA”). The plaintiffs in\n\nboth cases before us provide health benefits to their employees through self-\n\ninsured group health plans, and all employ TPAs to administer their plans.\n\n       Alternatively, an eligible organization may directly notify HHS of its\n\nreligious objection to complying with the contraceptive mandate. This more\n\nrecently developed method of taking advantage of the accommodation arose from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court’s order granting a preliminary injunction in\n\nWheaton College v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014).

Hobby Lobby Stores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2681317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2681317/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For self-insured plans, the financial risk of\nproviding health insurance lies with the organization itself; the organization directly pays for the\nplan participants’ and beneficiaries’ claims. Usually, organizations with self-insured plans hire a\nthird party to handle administrative tasks, such as developing provider networks and processing\nclaims.\n\n\n                                                12\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 13 of 148\n\n\nclosely held for-profit corporations whose owners have religious objections to\n\ncomplying with the contraceptive mandate. Three days after the Hobby Lobby\n\ndecision was issued, the Supreme Court in Wheaton College granted a request for a\n\npreliminary injunction pending appellate review to a plaintiff challenging the\n\naccommodation itself under RFRA, the same challenge the plaintiffs mount here.\n\nWheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The Supreme Court’s order enjoined HHS from\n\nenforcing the accommodation procedure against the college, so long as the college\n\n“inform[ed] the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that it is a non-\n\nprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to\n\nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.” Id. The Supreme Court warned,\n\nhowever, that the injunction order “should not be construed as an expression of the\n\nCourt’s views on the merits.” Id.8\n\n       In response to the order in Wheaton College, the Departments issued interim\n\nfinal regulations in August 2014 to allow an eligible organization to opt out by\n\nsending a letter to HHS, instead of giving Form 700 to its plan provider or TPA.\n\n79 Fed. Reg. 51092, 51094-95 (Aug. 27, 2014); see Ctr. for Medicare & Medicaid\n\nServs., Model Notice, https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-\n\n\n\n       8\n         The Seventh Circuit recently resolved Wheaton College’s appeal, affirming the district\ncourt’s denial of the college’s request for a preliminary injunction.

Reg. 41318 (July 14, 2015). Under\n\nthe current rules, if an eligible organization directly notifies HHS of its intent to\n\nopt out of the contraceptive mandate, the government then alerts the organization’s\n\nhealth plan provider or TPA that the organization has opted out and describes the\n\nplan provider’s or TPA’s resulting obligations. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii).\n\n       For insured plans, once an eligible organization avails itself of the\n\naccommodation, the plan provider must (1) “[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive\n\n       9\n          The interim final regulations also removed a provision (known as the non-interference\nprovision) requiring that eligible organizations “‘must not, directly or indirectly[,] seek to\ninterfere with a third party administrator’s arrangements to provide or arrange for separate\npayments for contraceptive services,’ and ‘must not, directly or indirectly, seek to influence a\nthird party administrator’s decision to make any such arrangements.’” 79 Fed. Reg. at 51095\n(quoting 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(iii)).\n\n\n                                               14\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 15 of 148\n\n\ncoverage from the group health insurance coverage” and (2) “[p]rovide separate\n\npayments for any contraceptive services required to be covered” for the plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i).\n\n       For self-insured plans, the regulations provide that when an eligible\n\norganization invokes the accommodation, its TPA is designated as the plan\n\nadministrator under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”),\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1002(16), with respect to contraceptive services. Under the\n\nregulations, the TPA is designated as the plan administrator in one of two ways. If\n\nthe eligible organization provides a copy of Form 700 to its TPA, then the\n\nregulations treat the form “as a designation of the [TPA] as the plan administrator”\n\nfor ERISA purposes. 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). If the eligible organization\n\ninstead notifies HHS of its intent to opt out, then the Department of Labor notifies\n\nthe TPA that it shall be the plan administrator with respect to contraceptive\n\nservices for ERISA purposes. Id.\n\n       Upon receiving notification, the TPA has the option of terminating its\n\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization.10 See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n\n       10\n           If the TPA terminates the relationship, the organization must (1) contract with a new\nTPA to administer its self-insured plan, (2) convert to an insured plan by contracting with a plan\nprovider, or (3) administer the plan itself. If the eligible organization contracts with a new TPA,\nthen it remains subject to the mandate and must provide contraceptive coverage, seek an\naccommodation, or pay a penalty. Alternatively, the organization could restructure its plan and\ncontract with a plan provider that would assume the risk of providing health insurance (that is,\nchange from a self-insured to an insured plan).

If it remains as the TPA, then it must provide (or arrange for another\n\ninsurer to provide) contraceptive benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the\n\nself-insured plan. Id.; 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(c). 11\n\n       Significantly, plan providers and TPAs “may not impose any cost-sharing\n\nrequirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any\n\npremium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the\n\neligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.”\n\n26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(c)(2)(i); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii).12 Plan\n\nproviders “must segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible\n\norganization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive\n\ncomply with the mandate, seek an accommodation, or pay a penalty. Finally, the organization\ncould continue with its self-insured plan without a TPA, meaning the organization would assume\nresponsibility for administering claims. Although the Departments are unaware of the existence\nof a single self-insured plan without a TPA, they have created a safe harbor that excuses such a\nplan from complying with the contraceptive mandate so long as it annually notifies HHS that it\nhas no TPA and plan participants and beneficiaries that contraceptive coverage is not provided.\nThe Departments will provide this safe harbor while considering an additional accommodation.\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39880-81.\n       11\n          Self-insured plans run by houses of worship and certain organizations controlled by or\nassociated with a house of worship, known as “church plans,” are not subject to the provisions of\nERISA unless they elect otherwise. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 410(d), 414(e). The government lacks\nauthority to compel the TPA of a church plan not subject to ERISA to provide contraceptive\ncoverage. See 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2). Nonetheless, the TPA for a church plan may voluntarily\nprovide contraceptive services; the government incentivizes these TPAs to provide the coverage\nby offering larger reimbursements. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41323 n.22; 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d).\n       12\n          The government reimburses plan providers and TPAs for providing contraception\nbenefits. Plan providers receive a downward adjustment to the user fees they must pay to the\nfederal government to sell plans on the federally-facilitated health exchanges. The process for\nTPAs can be more complicated. If the TPA is not itself a participating insurer, then it must\ncontract for contraceptive coverage with a participating insurer, and the insurer then passes on\nthe reimbursement to the TPA. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n\n                                                16\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 17 of 148\n\n\nservices.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). A plan provider or TPA also must notify\n\nplan participants and beneficiaries (contemporaneously with the delivery of other\n\nplan materials, if possible) “that the eligible organization does not administer or\n\nfund contraceptive benefits,” but that the plan provider or TPA instead “provides\n\nseparate payments for contraceptive services.” 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(d);\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(d).\n\nB.    The Parties and Procedural History\n\n      This opinion addresses two cases: one brought by EWTN and one brought\n\nby two Catholic Dioceses and a group of related persons and entities. Below, we\n\nbriefly discuss the plaintiffs and the procedural history of each case in turn.\n\n      1.     Eternal Word Television Network\n\n      Plaintiff-appellant EWTN is a non-profit worldwide Catholic media network\n\nfounded in 1981 by Mother Mary Angelica, a Catholic nun. EWTN, based in\n\nIrondale, Alabama, has approximately 350 employees. The network consists of 11\n\ntelevision feeds and two radio stations that reach 230 million homes in 144\n\ncountries and territories. Its programming includes daily Mass, Catholic devotions,\n\ncoverage of Catholic Church events, documentaries, children’s programs,\n\neducational series, and other television and radio shows that support EWTN’s\n\nmission of “serv[ing] the orthodox belief and teaching of the Church as proclaimed\n\nby the Supreme Pontiff and his predecessors.” Compl. at 5, No. 1:13-cv-00521-\n\n\n                                          17\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 18 of 148\n\n\nCG-C, Doc. 1. EWTN has a self-insured group health plan to provide health\n\ninsurance benefits to its employees. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as\n\nthe TPA for the plan.\n\n       EWTN, together with the State of Alabama, 13 filed a complaint challenging\n\nthe contraceptive mandate and accompanying regulations under RFRA, the First\n\nAmendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. The complaint\n\nalleged that “EWTN cannot facilitate access to health care insurance . . . that\n\ncovers artificial contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and\n\ncounseling, without violating its deeply held religious beliefs.” Compl. at 7, No.\n\n1:13-cv-00521-CG-C, Doc. 1. To EWTN, this means that its religious beliefs\n\nprevent it both from providing contraceptive coverage in its health plan and from\n\nusing the accommodation. As a result, EWTN alleged, the contraceptive mandate\n\n“imposes government pressure and coercion on EWTN to change or violate its\n\nreligious beliefs” because if it does not provide coverage or use the\n\naccommodation, it faces fines for non-compliance with the mandate. Id. at 27.\n\n       EWTN and Alabama moved for partial summary judgment on five of the 17\n\ncounts in the complaint, including: Count One, alleging a violation of RFRA\n\n\n       13\n        Alabama was a party throughout the district court proceedings, but the State did not\njoin EWTN in this appeal.\n\n\n                                              18\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 19 of 148\n\n\nbased on the regulations’ burden on religious exercise; Count Two, alleging a\n\nviolation of the Free Exercise Clause based on the same burden; Count Three,\n\nalleging a violation of the Free Exercise Clause based on intentional discrimination\n\namong religious organizations; Count Five, alleging a violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause based on the selective imposition of a burden on some\n\nreligious organizations; and Count Nine, alleging a violation of the Free Speech\n\nClause based on compelled speech. Alabama joined in EWTN’s motion and\n\nadditionally moved for summary judgment on Count Seventeen, which sought a\n\ndeclaration that the contraceptive mandate does not preempt Alabama law.\n\n      The defendants-appellees—the Departments and their Secretaries—filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on all\n\nof the plaintiffs’ claims. The district court denied EWTN’s and Alabama’s\n\nmotions for summary judgment and granted the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment as to Counts One, Two, Five, and Nine. On a motion by the plaintiffs,\n\nthe district court entered a final judgment on those four counts pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and stayed litigation of the remaining claims\n\npending appeal.\n\n      EWTN timely appealed. On EWTN’s motion, we issued an injunction\n\npending appeal, preventing the defendants from enforcing the mandate or the\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 20 of 148\n\n\naccommodation against EWTN.

The Diocesan Plaintiffs, CENGI, and Catholic Charities\n\n      A group of Catholic entities—the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta,\n\nthe Archbishop of Atlanta, Christ the King Catholic School, Catholic Charities of\n\nthe Archdiocese of Atlanta (“Catholic Charities”), the Roman Catholic Diocese of\n\nSavannah, and the Bishop of Savannah—filed a lawsuit against the Departments\n\nand their Secretaries. Both the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of\n\nSavannah (collectively with the Bishop and Archbishop, “the Dioceses”) are\n\nassociations of Catholic parishes and organizations, including Catholic schools.\n\nCatholic Charities is a nonprofit organization that provides social services,\n\nincluding immigration counseling, mental health counseling, marriage counseling,\n\nand pregnancy support services. The second amended complaint added as a\n\nplaintiff Catholic Education of North Georgia (“CENGI”) and removed Christ the\n\nKing Catholic School. CENGI is a nonprofit organization that oversees five\n\nCatholic schools in the Atlanta area.\n\n      The Atlanta Archdiocese operates a self-insured health plan, which covers\n\nemployees of the Archdiocese, Catholic Charities, and CENGI. The Savannah\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 21 of 148\n\n\nDiocese operates two self-insured health plans for its employees. Meritain Health\n\nserves as the TPA for all three plans.14\n\n       The second amended complaint alleged that the contraceptive mandate and\n\naccompanying regulations violate RFRA, the First Amendment, the non-delegation\n\ndoctrine, 15 and the APA. The plaintiffs alleged that the regulations require them\n\n“to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate insurance coverage for abortion-inducing\n\ndrugs, sterilization, and contraception, in violation of their religious beliefs.”\n\nSecond Am. Compl. at 6, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, Doc. 56. They alleged that the\n\nregulations further burden religious exercise “by driving a wedge between\n\nreligious organizations, like the Atlanta Archdiocese, and their equally religious\n\ncharitable arms, such as Plaintiffs Catholic Charities and CENGI.” Id. Because\n\nthe charitable arms do not qualify as “religious employers,” the Dioceses alleged\n\n       14\n           The parties disagree over whether these health plans qualify as “church plans” for\npurposes of ERISA. We need not decide whether the plans at issue are church plans because\ntheir ERISA status does not impact our conclusion that the accommodation does not\nsubstantially burden religious exercise. If the plans are not church plans, then our analysis as to\nEWTN’s self-insured plan applies, and the accommodation presents no burden on religious\nexercise. See infra Part III.A.2.b. If the plans are church plans, then the government lacks\nauthority to enforce the contraceptive mandate against the plaintiffs’ TPAs, rendering the\nplaintiffs’ assertion that their actions trigger such coverage even weaker.

The plaintiffs cross-moved\n\nfor summary judgment as to seven of their eight counts, which alleged that the\n\nmandate and accompanying regulations: burden religious exercise in violation of\n\nRFRA (Count One); violate the Free Exercise Clause, based on the same burden\n\n(Count Two); compel speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause (Count Three);\n\nprohibit speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause (Count Four); favor certain\n\nreligious groups and entangle the government in religion in violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause (Count Five); interfere with internal church governance in\n\nviolation of both the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses (Count Six); and\n\ninvolve an impermissible delegation of unchecked legislative authority to the\n\nDepartments (Count Seven).\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to Catholic Charities and\n\nCENGI on their RFRA claims, holding that the contraceptive mandate and\n\naccommodation substantially burden the organizations’ religious exercise and are\n\nnot the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.\n\n\n       16\n         We note that there is no dispute that EWTN, CENGI, and Catholic Charities qualify for\nthe accommodation and not for the religious employer exemption.\n\n\n                                             22\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 23 of 148\n\n\nThe court enjoined the Departments from enforcing the mandate or the\n\naccommodation against Catholic Charities and CENGI. In addition, the court\n\ngranted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on their claim that the non-\n\ninterference provision created a content-based speech restriction in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\n      As to the Dioceses’ RFRA claim, the court granted summary judgment to\n\nthe Departments. The Dioceses had argued first that they might at some point have\n\nto pay more in premiums to help cover their plan providers’ cost of contraceptive\n\ncoverage, in violation of their religious beliefs, and second that the distinction\n\nbetween religious employers and organizations eligible for the accommodation\n\nwould force the Dioceses to remove unaffiliated Catholic schools from their\n\ninsurance plans. Rejecting both arguments, the district court ruled that the first\n\nargument was merely speculative (and the outcome on which the Dioceses\n\nspeculated would, in any event, be prohibited by law) and the second argument\n\nfailed to assert a legitimate religious exercise. The district court granted the\n\nDepartments’ summary judgment motion as to all of the plaintiffs’ remaining\n\nclaims based on the First Amendment, the non-delegation doctrine, and the APA.\n\n      Despite the split judgment, only the Departments appealed the district\n\ncourt’s decision.

RFRA\n\n      RFRA provides that the federal government “shall not substantially burden a\n\nperson’s exercise of religion” unless it demonstrates that the burden “is in\n\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-\n\n1(a)-(b). Congress passed RFRA in 1993 in response to the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v.\n\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), which held that “a law that is neutral and of general\n\napplicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if\n\nthe law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.”\n\nChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.

In Smith, the Supreme Court reasoned that “[t]o make an\n\nindividual’s obligation to obey [a neutral and generally applicable] law contingent\n\nupon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State’s\n\ninterest is ‘compelling[,]’ . . . contradicts both constitutional tradition and common\n\nsense.” Smith, 494 U.S. at 885 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 26 of 148\n\n\n      Congress stated that the purpose of RFRA was “to restore the compelling\n\ninterest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106660\"><a href=\"/opinion/106660/sherbert-v-verner/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963) and Wisconsin\n\nv.

Congress declared the\n\nstrict scrutiny standard provided “a workable test for striking sensible balances\n\nbetween religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.” Id.\n\n§ 2000bb(a)(5). Indeed, RFRA “provide[s] even broader protection for religious\n\nliberty than was available under” Sherbert or Yoder because the government must\n\nalso show that it used the least restrictive means to achieve its compelling interest.\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2761 n.3.\n\n             b.     Hobby Lobby\n\n      In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court held that enforcing the contraceptive\n\nmandate without an accommodation against closely held for-profit corporations\n\nthat objected on religious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage violated\n\nRFRA. The corporations and their owners challenged the mandate as substantially\n\nburdening their religious exercise. Id. at 2764-66. The owners of the corporations\n\nsincerely believed that life begins at conception and that it is a sin to facilitate\n\naccess to contraceptive drugs or devices that could destroy an embryo. Id. It was\n\nundisputed that the mandate required the plaintiffs to provide health insurance that\n\ncovered methods of contraception that could result in the destruction of an embryo.\n\nId. at 2775. The plaintiffs asserted that the mandate left them with only two\n\n\n                                           26\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 27 of 148\n\n\noptions: (1) provide coverage for contraception in violation of their religious\n\nbeliefs or (2) pay significant penalties. Given these choices, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that the mandate “impose[d] a substantial burden.” Id. at 2779.\n\n      The government argued there was no substantial burden because the\n\nconnection between what the mandate required the plaintiffs to do (provide health\n\ninsurance that covered contraception) and the end that they found morally wrong\n\n(the destruction of an embryo) was too attenuated. Id. at 2777. The premise of the\n\ngovernment’s attenuation argument was that “providing the coverage would not\n\nitself result in the destruction of an embryo; that would occur only if an employee\n\nchose to take advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four [contraceptive]\n\nmethods at issue.” Id. In other words, the government asserted that the plaintiffs’\n\nbelief—that providing insurance coverage for contraception facilitated the\n\ndestruction of embryos—was unreasonable. The Supreme Court rejected this\n\nargument, which would have required the Court to determine the “circumstances\n\nunder which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but\n\nthat has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by\n\nanother.” Id. at 2778. The Supreme Court cautioned that “federal courts have no\n\nbusiness addressing” such questions of religion and moral philosophy. Id. Instead,\n\nthe Supreme Court deferred to the plaintiffs’ religious belief that the coverage “is\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 28 of 148\n\n\nconnected to the destruction of embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it\n\nimmoral for them to provide the coverage.” Id.\n\n       The Court then considered whether the mandate survived strict scrutiny.\n\nThe majority assumed that the mandate furthered a compelling governmental\n\ninterest 18 but held that it was not the least restrictive means of doing so.

The Court pointed to the accommodation, which at the time applied only\n\nto nonprofit organizations with religious objections, as a less restrictive alternative.\n       18\n           The majority opinion assumed without deciding that the government has a compelling\ninterest. In separate opinions, five members of the Court appeared to go further, suggesting that\na majority of the Court would agree that there is, in fact, a compelling interest.\n        The four dissenting justices concluded that the government carried its burden in showing\nthat the mandate “furthers compelling interests in public health and women’s well being.”\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Justice Kennedy, who joined the\nmajority, offered a separate concurrence in which he emphasized the importance of the\nmajority’s assumption that there is a compelling interest without explicitly stating that he agreed\nwith that premise: “[it is] important to confirm that a premise of the Court’s opinion is its\nassumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in\nthe health of female employees.” Id. at 2786 (Kennedy, J., concurring). He also reiterated the\ngovernment’s position that the mandate “provid[ed] insurance coverage that is necessary to\nprotect the health of female employees, coverage that is significantly more costly than for a male\nemployee.” Id. at 2785-86.\n        Justice Ginsburg in her dissent and other courts have treated Justice Kennedy’s\nconcurrence as recognizing that the government has a compelling interest.

Nonetheless,\neven if Justice Kennedy merely assumed (but did not decide) there is a compelling interest, such\nthat a majority of the Supreme Court has not reached that conclusion, we conclude that there is a\ncompelling interest here. See infra Part III.B.2.c.(i).\n\n\n                                                28\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 29 of 148\n\n\nThe Court explained that after an organization opts out, the plan provider (for\n\ninsured plans) or TPA (for self-insured plans) must exclude contraceptive coverage\n\nfrom the group health plan and provide separate payments for contraceptive\n\ncoverage without imposing cost sharing requirements on the organization, plan, or\n\nplan participants or beneficiaries. Id. at 2782. Although the Court declined to\n\nanswer whether the accommodation complied with RFRA, it lauded the\n\naccommodation as “seek[ing] to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit\n\ncorporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the\n\nsame access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies\n\nwhose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage.” Id. at\n\n2759. The Court further recognized that “[t]he effect of the HHS-created\n\naccommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other\n\ncompanies involved in these cases would be precisely zero.”19 Id. at 2760.\n\n               c.      Wheaton College\n\n       After Hobby Lobby, the Court considered the accommodation itself in the\n\ncontext of an injunction sought under RFRA in Wheaton College. The Court\n\nenjoined the government from enforcing the mandate but required the plaintiff to\n\n       19\n           Justice Kennedy praised how the accommodation reconciled the competing priorities\nof ensuring that “no person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or\nher religion” and that the same exercise does not “unduly restrict other persons . . . in protecting\ntheir own interests, interests the law deems compelling.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2786-87\n(Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 30 of 148\n\n\ninform HHS in writing that it had religious objections to providing coverage for\n\ncontraceptive services. 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The Court explained that the\n\ngovernment could “rely[] on this notice . . . to facilitate the provision of full\n\ncontraceptive coverage.” Id. The practical effect of the Wheaton College decision\n\nwas twofold: the plaintiff received an accommodation, and HHS could rely on the\n\nnotification to provide contraceptive coverage to the participants and beneficiaries\n\nof the plaintiff’s plan.\n\n              d.     Other RFRA Challenges to the Accommodation\n\n       After Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College, federal courts around the country\n\nconsidered RFRA challenges to the accommodation. Applying these two Supreme\n\nCourt decisions, seven of the eight circuits to review these cases held that the\n\naccommodation does not violate RFRA. See Mich.

After considering Hobby Lobby, the Seventh Circuit issued\nNotre Dame II again affirming the denial of a preliminary injunction.\n       21\n         Two circuits have held, in the alternative, that even assuming the accommodation\nimposes a substantial burden, it survives strict scrutiny under RFRA. See Notre Dame II,\n786 F.3d at 616-17; Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 256-57.\n\n\n                                              31\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 32 of 148\n\n\naccommodation itself. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the mandate—\n\nthat is, the requirement that they provide contraceptive coverage—when their only\n\noptions were to provide the coverage or pay significant penalties. But in the\n\naccommodation cases, the plaintiffs have challenged the regulatory scheme that\n\nallows them to opt out of the mandate without penalty. Put another way, the\n\nplaintiffs in the accommodation cases “do not challenge the general obligation\n\nunder the ACA to provide contraceptive coverage. They instead challenge the\n\nprocess they must follow to get out of complying with that obligation.” Little\n\nSisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1160. Because they assert that “the exemption\n\nprocess itself imposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths,” their\n\nchallenges are somewhat “paradoxical and virtually unprecedented.” Priests for\n\nLife I, 772 F.3d at 246 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The circuits upholding the accommodation recognized that the question of\n\nwhether there is a substantial burden involves an objective inquiry. After\n\ninterpreting the ACA and its regulations, they held that the act of opting out does\n\nnot trigger contraceptive coverage. See, e.g., Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 614\n\n(explaining that “[i]t is federal law, rather than the religious organization’s signing\n\nand mailing the form, that requires . . . third-party administrators of self-insured\n\nhealth plans[] to cover contraceptive services”). Although the eligible\n\norganizations asserted that the act of opting out makes them complicit in providing\n\n\n                                          32\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 33 of 148\n\n\ncoverage, these courts explained that this objection could not constitute a\n\nsubstantial burden because individuals “have no RFRA right to be free from the\n\nunease, or even anguish, of knowing that third parties are legally privileged or\n\nobligated to act in ways their religion abhors.” Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 246.\n\n       In Sharpe Holdings, the Eighth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion,\n\nholding that the accommodation substantially burdened religious exercise, and\n\nenjoined the government from enforcing the accommodation. Relying on Hobby\n\nLobby, the Eighth Circuit held that it was bound to accept the plaintiffs’ “assertion\n\nthat self-certification under the accommodation process—using either Form 700 or\n\nHHS Notice—would violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.” 22 Sharpe\n\nHoldings, 801 F.3d at 941. Because the plaintiffs faced a substantial penalty if\n\nthey failed to seek an accommodation or provide contraceptive coverage, the\n\nEighth Circuit concluded there was a substantial burden. Id. at 942.\n\n       The Eighth Circuit then applied strict scrutiny. The court assumed that the\n\ngovernment had a compelling interest but held that the government had failed to\n\ncarry its burden to show that it lacked other means to achieve its interest without\n\nimposing a substantial burden on religion. Id. at 943. The Eighth Circuit\n\n\n       22\n         Although the Eighth Circuit deferred to the plaintiffs’ understanding of how the\naccommodation functioned, it agreed that the act of opting out triggered coverage. See Sharpe\nHoldings, 801 F.3d at 942 (TPAs have no “wholly independent obligation” to provide\ncontraceptive coverage).\n\n\n                                              33\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 34 of 148\n\n\nconcluded that less restrictive alternatives included the government: (1) requiring\n\nless information from eligible organizations seeking an accommodation; (2)\n\nassuming the cost of providing contraceptives through subsidies, reimbursements,\n\ntax credits, or tax deductions to employees; (3) paying for distribution of\n\ncontraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals; or (4)\n\nmaking contraceptive coverage available through the healthcare exchanges. Id. at\n\n944-45. Given these alternatives, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the\n\naccommodation failed to survive strict scrutiny.\n\n       2.     RFRA Analysis\n\n       With this legal landscape in mind, we now consider the plaintiffs’ RFRA\n\nchallenge. We hold that their challenge fails because (1) the accommodation does\n\nnot substantially burden their religious exercise, and (2) in the alternative, even if\n\nthere is a substantial burden, the accommodation survives strict scrutiny.\n\n              a.     The Plaintiffs Allege a Sincere Religious Belief.\n\n       A threshold question we must ask is whether the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs\n\non which their RFRA claims are based are sincere. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2774 n.28 (“To qualify for RFRA’s protection, an asserted belief must be\n\n‘sincere’. . . .”). It is well established that we defer to a plaintiff’s statement of its\n\nown belief, so long as the plaintiff actually holds that belief. See id. at 2779 (“[I]t\n\nis not for [courts] to say that [the plaintiffs’] religious beliefs are mistaken or\n\n\n                                            34\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 35 of 148\n\n\ninsubstantial.”); Davila v. Gladden, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1204 (11th Cir.) (“[W]e look\n\nonly to see whether the claimant . . . actually holds the beliefs he claims to hold.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied sub nom., Davila v. Hayes, 136 S.\n\nCt. 78 (2015).\n\n       Each plaintiff states that its religious beliefs prevent it from paying for,\n\nproviding, or facilitating the distribution of contraceptives. Each plaintiff also\n\nasserts that it cannot be complicit in the provision of contraception. The\n\ngovernment does not contest the sincerity of these religious beliefs, nor is there any\n\nindication whatsoever in the record that the stated beliefs are insincere. We thus\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs at issue are sincere.\n\n             b.     The Accommodation Does Not Substantially Burden the\n                    Plaintiffs’ Religious Exercise.\n\n      We now consider whether, accepting the plaintiffs’ sincere religious beliefs,\n\nthe accommodation substantially burdens their religious exercise. The plaintiffs\n\nassert that the act of notifying HHS or their TPAs of their religious objection will\n\neither trigger contraceptive coverage or make them complicit in a system that\n\nprovides such coverage. Due to the significance they attach to opting out, the\n\nplaintiffs contend that the accommodation itself imposes a substantial burden\n\nbecause it puts them to the choice of violating their sincerely held religious beliefs\n\nor paying a substantial penalty. We accept the plaintiffs’ sincere belief that\n\ntriggering coverage or being complicit in coverage violates their religious beliefs\n                                           35\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 36 of 148\n\n\nand that the accommodation puts them to a choice between honoring their religious\n\nbeliefs and facing significant penalties. We nonetheless conclude that the\n\naccommodation imposes no substantial burden.\n\n                     (i)     The Substantial Burden Analysis Involves an\n                             Objective Inquiry.\n\n       “[A] ‘substantial burden’ must place more than an inconvenience on\n\nreligious exercise.” Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76550\"><a href=\"/opinion/76550/midrash-sephardi-inc-v-town-of-surfside/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1227 (11th Cir. 2004). 23 A law is substantially burdensome when it places\n\n“significant pressure” on an adherent to act contrary to her religious beliefs,\n\nmeaning that it “directly coerces the religious adherent to conform . . . her\n\nbehavior.” Id. Thus, the government imposes a substantial burden when it places\n\n“pressure that tends to force adherents to forego religious precepts.” Id.\n\n       This inquiry involves both subjective and objective dimensions. Hobby\n\nLobby made clear that there is a subjective aspect to this inquiry: courts must\n\naccept a religious adherent’s assertion that his religious beliefs require him to take\n\nor abstain from taking a specified action. See 134 S. Ct. at 2779. But the\n\n\n       23\n           Midrash concerned the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n(“RLUIPA”), which Congress enacted after the Supreme Court struck down RFRA as applied to\nthe states in City of Boerne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). RLUIPA imposes the same\nrequirement as RFRA—that the government refrain from substantially burdening religious\nexercise unless the burden is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government\ninterest—on programs and activities that receive federal funding. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1. We\napply the same substantial burden analysis under both RLUIPA and RFRA. See generally\nDavila, 777 F.3d at 1204; Midrash, 366 F.3d at 1237.\n\n\n                                              36\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 37 of 148\n\n\nsubstantial burden analysis does not end there. We agree with our seven sister\n\ncircuits that the question of substantial burden also presents “a question of law for\n\ncourts to decide.” Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 247.\n\n      The objective inquiry requires courts to consider whether the government\n\nactually “puts” the religious adherent to the “choice” of incurring a “serious”\n\npenalty or “engag[ing] in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs.”\n\nHolt v. Hobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2771249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2771249/holt-v-hobbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (2015) (second alteration in original and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, courts must determine what\n\nthe challenged law actually requires of the plaintiff. For example, in Holt, a\n\nMuslim inmate asserted that prison grooming policy substantially burdened his\n\nreligious exercise because it prohibited him from growing a beard, which his\n\nreligion required. The Supreme Court explained that because the “grooming\n\npolicy requires petitioner to shave his beard,” the policy “put[]” him to the choice\n\nof violating his religious beliefs or facing serious disciplinary action. Id. In Holt,\n\nas in many RFRA cases, this inquiry was straightforward because there was no\n\ndispute about what the government’s policy objectively required of the religious\n\nadherent. But when there is a dispute about what a law or governmental policy\n\nobjectively requires, it is for the courts to construe the law or policy.\n\n      The plaintiffs here contend that under Hobby Lobby no such objective\n\ninquiry is required. In their view, a religious adherent’s mere assertion that she is\n\n\n                                           37\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 38 of 148\n\n\nbeing compelled to violate her sincerely held religious belief means that the\n\ngovernment has put her to such a choice, regardless of what the law objectively\n\nrequires.24 We disagree. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the\n\ncontraceptive mandate. It was undisputed that the mandate gave the plaintiffs just\n\ntwo options: provide contraceptive coverage or pay a substantial penalty.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court engaged in no objective analysis about what the\n\nmandate required, such analysis was unnecessary because the parties agreed that\n\nthe government, through the mandate, put the plaintiffs to the choice of providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage or paying a hefty fine.

Reg. at 39880 (“[T]he Departments continue to\nbelieve that there are no self-insured group health plans in this circumstance.”).

The plaintiffs contend that because an eligible organization’s TPA\n\nonly becomes obligated to provide coverage when the organization opts out, by\n\nopting out they will be triggering coverage. The government argues to the contrary\n\nthat plan participants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive coverage under\n\nthe ACA regardless of any opt out. We conclude that it is for the courts to\n\ndetermine objectively what the regulations require and whether the government\n\nhas, in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs by\n\nseeking the accommodation or incurring a substantial penalty.\n\n       We reject a framework that takes away from courts the responsibility to\n\ndecide what action the government requires and leaves that answer entirely to the\n\nreligious adherent. Such a framework improperly substitutes religious belief for\n\nlegal analysis regarding the operation of federal law. Indeed, the plaintiffs have\n\nidentified nothing in RFRA or case law that allows a religious adherent to dictate\n\nto the courts what the law requires. The plain language of RFRA simply does not\n\nsupport reducing the role of federal courts to “rubber stamps” that automatically\n\n\ntemporary safe harbor so long as the plan notifies (1) HHS that it has no TPA and (2) plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries that the plan provides no benefits for contraceptive services. Id.\n        We assume for purposes of this appeal that if the government forced an eligible\norganization to have a self-insured plan without a TPA, it would be imposing a substantial\nburden. Nonetheless, we conclude there is no substantial burden because eligible organizations\ncan instead select the accommodation.\n\n\n                                                39\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 40 of 148\n\n\nrecognize a substantial burden whenever a religious adherent asserts there is one.\n\nCatholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 218. If Congress had intended strict\n\nscrutiny to be triggered in all circumstances by a religious adherent’s claim that\n\nthere is a burden, it would have said so. Instead, it required that the federal\n\ngovernment “substantially burden” the adherent’s religious exercise.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague concedes that the question of substantial burden\n\ninvolves an objective inquiry but asserts that the inquiry should be limited to\n\nwhether the government has imposed a substantial penalty. See Dissent at 113-15.\n\nThis analysis would require courts to defer to a religious adherent’s sincere belief\n\nthat the government is forcing her to choose between her religious belief and\n\npaying a substantial fine, even when the religious adherent is objectively wrong\n\nabout how the law operates and what action the government requires her to take.\n\nThe dissent’s view is flawed because any burden (even an objectively insubstantial\n\none) becomes a substantial burden if the penalty is heavy enough.\n\n      We acknowledge that in Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court cautioned courts\n\nagainst dictating to religious adherents “the circumstances under which it is\n\nimmoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the\n\neffect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.”\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2778. In some cases, a court’s objective analysis interpreting a statute\n\nor regulation may contradict a religious adherent’s sincerely held belief about what\n\n\n                                          40\n\f               Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 41 of 148\n\n\nthat law requires. But such questions about what a law means are not the type of\n\n“difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy” for which\n\ncourts must defer to religious adherents. Id.; see Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 623\n\n(Hamilton, J., concurring) (explaining that the interpretation of the regulations that\n\ngive rise to the accommodation “is an issue not of moral philosophy but of federal\n\nlaw”).\n\n         Deciding how the law functions is not the only objective part of the\n\nsubstantial burden inquiry. The Supreme Court’s free exercise cases (prior to\n\nSmith) distinguished between substantial burdens on religious exercise, which are\n\nprotected, and de minimis burdens, which are not. For example, a religious\n\nadherent may not “require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in\n\nways that comport” with the person’s religious beliefs, even if the government\n\naction interferes with that person’s religious exercise.

But it was plain that the action required of the plaintiffs in that\ncase—paying to provide health insurance that included contraceptive coverage—imposed a\nsubstantial burden. Accordingly, the Court had no occasion to address the more difficult\nquestion presented here, where the plaintiffs’ claims of substantial burden rest on their assertion\nthat seeking an accommodation results in another entity (the TPA) providing contraceptive\ncoverage and thus makes them complicit in a system that achieves an end to which they have a\nreligious objection. In other words, Hobby Lobby did not pose the issue whether courts must\ndefer to a religious adherent’s assertion that seeking an accommodation (opting out) itself\nimposes a substantial burden.\n       27\n           Congress used “substantial burden” instead of “burden” in order “to clarify [that] the\ncompelling interest required by the Religious Freedom [Restoration] Act applies only where\nthere is a substantial burden placed on the individual free exercise of religion.” 139 Cong.

Nonetheless, there are cases brought under\n\nRFRA in which the purported burden is too slight to trigger strict scrutiny. For\n\nexample, in Kaemmerling v. Lappin, an inmate challenged under RFRA the Bureau\n\nof Prison’s collection and analysis of his DNA. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187263\"><a href=\"/opinion/187263/kaemmerling-v-lappin/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 673-74 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2008). He claimed that the government’s sampling, collection, and analysis of his\n\nDNA violated his sincerely held religious beliefs about the proper use of DNA.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit concluded there was no substantial burden. Importantly, the\n\ninmate had no religious objection to the collection of his bodily material; he\n\nchallenged only how the government would subsequently use that specimen to\n\nextract his DNA information. Id. at 678-79. There was no question that the\n\nBureau of Prisons required the inmate to submit a bodily specimen that would be\n\nused for an end to which he had a strong religious objection (that is, the collection\n\nand analysis of his DNA). But the D.C. Circuit held there was no substantial\n\nburden because the inmate “suggest[ed] no way in which these government acts\n\npressure[d] him to modify his own behavior in any way that would violate his\n\nbeliefs.” Id. at 679. Kaemmerling reinforces that a religious adherent cannot use\n\nRFRA to stop the government or third parties from taking subsequent actions to\n\nwhich he objects when the acts required of him impose a de minimis burden.28\n\n      28\n           Our dissenting colleague worries that our framework creates a “Bizarro World” in\n\n\n                                               44\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 45 of 148\n\n\n                      (ii)    No Substantial Burden Exists.\n\n       To determine whether the accommodation objectively puts plaintiffs to the\n\nchoice of violating their religious beliefs or paying a significant fine, we must\n\nunderstand how the accommodation functions and what it requires of these\n\nplaintiffs. The only act that the regulations require the plaintiffs to take is to seek\n\nthe accommodation—that is, filling out and sending Form 700 to their TPAs or\n\nwriting a letter to HHS letting it know of their objections. The plaintiffs do not\n\ncontend that notifying HHS or their TPAs itself constitutes a substantial burden\n\nbecause of the time or effort involved. Rather, their objection is based on the\n\nsignificance they attribute to this act. They contend that the act of opting out\n\ntriggers contraceptive coverage for plan participants and beneficiaries or makes\n\nthem complicit in a system that provides contraceptive coverage. We accept that\n\nthe plaintiffs truly believe that triggering contraceptive coverage or being complicit\n\nin a system providing contraceptive coverage violates their religious beliefs. But\n\nwhich courts determine whether the burden imposed by a law or regulation violates the\nadherent’s beliefs. Dissent at 117-18. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying\nthat courts may determine that when a prison requires a Muslim inmate to shave his beard or the\ngovernment forces a Seventh-Day Adventist to work on the Sabbath, the religious adherent’s\nclaim that the government is coercing him to forego his religious precepts is wrong. But when a\ndispute exists about whether the challenged governmental policy actually requires an inmate to\nshave his beard or a person to work on Saturday, it is for the courts to determine what the law\nrequires. See, e.g., Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403-04 (Supreme Court performed its own analysis to\ndetermine whether challenged policy compelled Seventh-Day Adventist to work on Saturdays).\nLikewise, when a religious adherent challenges an accommodation scheme as imposing a\nsubstantial burden on the religious adherent based on subsequent actions taken by the\ngovernment or third parties, it is for the courts to determine whether the burden is substantial.\n\n\n                                               45\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 46 of 148\n\n\nour objective inquiry leads us to conclude that the government has not put\n\nplaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or facing a significant\n\npenalty. We hold there is no substantial burden.\n\n       Here’s why: the ACA and HRSA guidelines are what entitle plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to contraceptive coverage. The ACA provides that\n\nthe plaintiffs’ self-insured plans “shall, at a minimum provide coverage for and\n\nshall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . . . with respect to women, such\n\nadditional preventative care and screenings . . . as provided for in” the HRSA\n\nguidelines. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). The HRSA Guidelines, in turn, “require\n\ncoverage, without cost sharing, for ‘[a]ll . . . [FDA] approved contraceptive\n\nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all\n\nwomen with reproductive capacity.’” 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725 (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting HRSA guidelines).\n\n       The plaintiffs and the dissent take a different view of the statutory and\n\nregulatory scheme, contending that an eligible organization’s act of opting out\n\ntriggers the TPA’s designation as plan administrator and, without it, plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries would not receive contraceptive coverage.29 Indeed,\n\n\n       29\n       Because the plaintiffs here have only self-insured plans, we consider only the\naccommodation procedures that apply to self-insured health plans.\n      For an eligible organization with a plan insured by a third party, the accommodation\nimposes no new coverage obligation. The eligible organization’s act of opting out simply makes\n\n\n                                              46\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 47 of 148\n\n\nthe dissent asserts that opting out requires an eligible organization’s “affirmative\n\nparticipation” because the act of opting out is the “linchpin on which the\n\ncontraceptive mandate rests.” Dissent at 125. We disagree.\n\n       The ACA and the HRSA guidelines—not the opt out—are, to borrow the\n\ndissent’s term, the “linchpins” of the contraceptive mandate because they entitle\n\nwomen who are plan participants and beneficiaries covered by group health\n\ninsurance plans to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing. In other words,\n\nwomen are entitled to contraceptive coverage regardless of their employers’ action\n\n(or lack of action) with respect to seeking an accommodation. Because a woman’s\n\nentitlement to contraceptive benefits does not turn on whether her eligible\n\norganization employer chooses to comply with the law (by providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage or seeking an accommodation) or pay a substantial penalty (in the form\n\nof a tax) for noncompliance, we cannot say that the act of opting out imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden. 30\n\n\n\nthe coverage the plan provider’s “sole responsibility rather than one shared with the group health\nplan itself.” Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1181.\n       30\n           The dissent complains that our reading renders the act of opting out “meaningless.”\nDissent at 128 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dissent misses our point. Although plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive coverage under federal law regardless\nof any opt out, notification of the opt out allows the government to identify the plan participants\nand beneficiaries who will not receive contraceptive coverage from a self-insured eligible\norganization because of that organization’s religious objection to the mandate. In other words,\nthe act of opting out aids the government in identifying these women and making sure that they\nreceive the contraceptive coverage to which they are legally entitled. Thus, the act of opting out\n\n\n                                                47\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 48 of 148\n\n\n       We do not mean to imply that the act of opting out plays no causal role in\n\nthe ultimate provision of contraceptive coverage. We acknowledge that an eligible\n\norganization’s act of notifying HHS or its TPA of its objection results in the TPA’s\n\ndesignation as the plan administrator and gives rise to the TPA’s obligation to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage.31 See 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). But we view an\n\neligible organization’s act of opting out as, at most, an incidental cause of plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries receiving contraceptive coverage because these\n\nwomen are entitled to contraceptive coverage under the ACA and HRSA\n\nguidelines regardless of whether the eligible organization opts out. Accordingly,\n\neven if the act of opting out in some way leads to women receiving the\n\ncontraceptive coverage to which they were entitled under federal law, the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to establish that the act of opting out substantially burdens their\n\nreligious exercise. Importantly, the government does not force an eligible\n\norganization to provide contraceptive coverage, pay costs related to contraceptive\n\ncoverage, notify plan participants and beneficiaries of the existence of such\n\ncoverage, or even include the availability of such coverage from a separate source\n\nin information the plan provides to plan participants and beneficiaries. Instead, all\n\nhas significance in the regulatory scheme, but not because it creates a woman’s entitlement to\ncontraceptive coverage.\n       31\n          Indeed, the government has admitted that an eligible organization’s opt out results in a\nTPA’s designation as plan administrator and the TPA providing plan participants and\nbeneficiaries contraceptive benefits.\n\n\n                                                48\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 49 of 148\n\n\nof these responsibilities fall upon the TPA. Rather, the only action required of the\n\neligible organization is opting out: literally, the organization’s notification of its\n\nobjection. Such an opt out requirement is “typical of religious objection\n\naccommodations that shift responsibility to non-objecting entities only after an\n\nobjector declines to perform a task on religious grounds.” Little Sisters of the\n\nPoor, 794 F.3d at 1183.\n\n       The plaintiffs’ challenge is in substance indistinguishable from an objection\n\nto the government’s requiring another entity to provide coverage in their stead.\n\nSee Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 224 (characterizing an identical\n\nchallenge as seeking a “blanket religious veto over the government’s interactions\n\nwith others”). Put differently, the plaintiffs’ opposition to opting out is an\n\nobjection to their inability to keep the TPA with which they have contracted to\n\nprovide services in connection with healthcare coverage from complying with the\n\nrelevant regulations. The plaintiffs point to a but-for causal relationship between\n\ntheir opting out and the conduct that they find religiously objectionable. But, as\n\nthe Supreme Court has explained, a religious adherent cannot claim a substantial\n\nburden based on the subsequent conduct of another party. 32 See Bowen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n\n       <span class=\"page\">32</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n          The plaintiffs argue that under the accommodation they are facilitating access to\ncontraceptives because their ongoing contractual relationship with their TPA leads the TPA to\ncontinue to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries. It is true that a\nTPA remains as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive coverage only so long as the\norganization serves as the plan’s TPA. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs cannot show a substantial\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 50 of 148\n\n\nat 699-700 (“Just as the government may not insist that appellees engage in any set\n\nform of religious observance, so appellees may not demand that the Government\n\njoin in their chosen religious practices by refraining from using a number to\n\nidentify their daughter.”). 33\n\n       We recognize that the plaintiffs sincerely abhor and object to the subsequent\n\nacts taken by the government and their TPA, which ultimately result in the TPA\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries. We\n\nacknowledge that they “may not accept [the] distinction” that we draw here\n\nbetween their conduct and the downstream, separate conduct of HHS and the TPAs\n\nto provide coverage. Id. at 701 n.6. But we simply cannot say that RFRA affords\n\nthe plaintiffs the right to prevent women from obtaining contraceptive coverage to\n\nwhich federal law entitles them based on the de minimis burden that the plaintiffs\n\nface in notifying the government that they have a religious objection.\n\n       As the Seventh Circuit first articulated, an analogy to a conscientious\n\nobjector to the military draft illustrates why the accommodation does not impose a\n\n\nburden because, as explained above, their challenge is an objection to the TPA’s subsequent\nconduct.\n       33\n          The dissent dismisses Bowen as distinguishable because the plaintiffs here object only\nto their own participation in the accommodation, not to any acts taken by the government. See\nDissent at 126-27 n.32. We are not persuaded. The dissent’s position ignores that the plaintiffs\nobject to opting out because it requires them to play a causal role (albeit, a small one) in a system\nin which the government requires contraceptive coverage. Put another way, their religious\nobjection is, at its core, an objection to the government requiring the TPAs to provide coverage\nupon their opting out.\n\n\n                                                 50\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 51 of 148\n\n\nsubstantial burden. See Notre Dame I, 743 F.3d at 556. A religious conscientious\n\nobjector to the military draft may opt of military service based on his belief that\n\nwar is immoral. The objector sincerely believes that his act of opting out triggers\n\nthe drafting of another person in his place, and thus renders him complicit in the\n\nvery thing to which he objects. But we would reject the assertion that the\n\ngovernment’s subsequent act of drafting another person in his place—even though\n\nthe drafting was in some sense caused by the objector’s act of opting out—\n\ntransforms the act of lodging a conscientious objection into a substantial burden.\n\nSee id. Likewise, we reject the plaintiffs’ assertion that opting out imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden because the government requires a third party to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage after an eligible organization opts out.\n\n      Accordingly, we conclude that through the accommodation the government\n\nhas imposed no substantial burden on the plaintiffs. We thus hold that the\n\naccommodation does not violate RFRA.\n\n             c.     The Accommodation Survives Strict Scrutiny.\n\n      Even assuming that the accommodation imposes a substantial burden on\n\nplaintiffs’ religious exercise, RFRA allows the government to impose such a\n\nburden when it demonstrates that the burden “is in furtherance of a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest” and “is the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). Because the\n\n\n                                          51\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 52 of 148\n\n\ngovernment has carried its burden of showing that the accommodation is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering its compelling interests, we hold in the alternative\n\nthat the accommodation survives strict scrutiny under RFRA.\n\n                      (i)    Compelling Interests Justify the Accommodation.\n\n       In applying RFRA’s strict scrutiny test, we must first determine whether the\n\naccommodation is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.” Id.\n\nBecause the mandate and accommodation require the provision of cost-free\n\ncontraceptive coverage with little to no administrative burden on women, these\n\nregulations further compelling government interests in avoiding the adverse public\n\nhealth consequences of unintended pregnancies and in assuring women the equal\n\nbenefit of preventative care by requiring coverage for their distinctive health\n\nneeds.34 See Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 258-59.\n\n\n\n\n       34\n          As we explained above, the majority in Hobby Lobby assumed without deciding that\nthere was a compelling governmental interest. There is, however, an argument that five justices\nconcluded there was a compelling interest. See supra note 18. But even if Justice Kennedy’s\nconcurring opinion in Hobby Lobby did not recognize a compelling governmental interest, we\nwould hold that the compelling interest test is satisfied here.\n        We acknowledge that the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby criticized the government’s\npurported interests in “promoting public health and gender equality” as “broadly framed.” 134\nS. Ct. at 2779 (internal quotation marks omitted). But we agree with the D.C. Circuit that the\ngovernment has now provided a more focused analysis “by explaining how those larger interests\ninform and are specifically implicated in its decision to support women’s unhindered access to\ncontraceptive coverage.” Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 259.\n\n\n                                               52\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 53 of 148\n\n\n                             (a)     The Government’s Interests in Reducing the\n                                     Rate of Unintended Pregnancies Are\n                                     Compelling.\n\n       We begin our analysis with the facts: unintended or poorly spaced\n\npregnancies have a host of negative impacts on women and children. See supra\n\nPart I.A. Women who experience unintended pregnancies are often unaware of\n\ntheir condition in the early stages of their pregnancy, which leads them to delay\n\nprenatal care and cessation of behaviors such as smoking or alcohol consumption.\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39872. Babies born as a result of unintended pregnancies are at a\n\ngreater risk of premature birth and low birth weight. Id. Short interpregnancy\n\nintervals also result in a greater risk of prematurity and low birth weight. Id.\n\nContraceptive use can alleviate these public health problems. 35 “[G]reater use of\n\ncontraception within the population produces lower unintended pregnancy and\n\nabortion rates nationally.” IOM Report at 105.\n\n       During debate over the ACA, Congress was informed that “[i]n America\n\ntoday, too many women are delaying or skipping preventive care because of the\n\ncosts of copays and limited access.” 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (Dec. 1, 2009)\n\n(statement of Sen. Gillibrand). The IOM Report also found that “cost-sharing\n\n       35\n           Many contraceptives also carry significant positive health side effects. “[T]he non-\ncontraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception include treatment of menstrual disorders, acne\nor hirsutism, and pelvic pain. Long-term use of oral contraceptives has been shown to reduce a\nwoman’s risk of endometrial cancer, as well as protect against pelvic inflammatory disease and\nsome benign breast diseases.” IOM Report at 107 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n                                               53\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 54 of 148\n\n\nrequirements, such as deductibles and copayments, can pose barriers to care and\n\nresult in reduced use of preventive and primary care services, particularly for low-\n\nincome populations.” IOM Report at 109. The Women’s Health Amendment,\n\nwhich added to the ACA the requirement that group and individual health plans\n\nprovide women with coverage for preventative care and screenings, aimed to\n\nincrease women’s use of preventive care by removing administrative and financial\n\nbarriers. See 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (statement of Sen. Shaheen) (“Too often,\n\nwomen forgo their health care needs because they are not affordable. We know\n\ncost plays a greater role in preventing women from accessing health care than it\n\ndoes men. In 2007, more than half of all women reported problems accessing\n\nneeded health care because of costs.”); see also Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 260\n\n(explaining that Congress and the Executive branch determined with the ACA and\n\nits regulations that “serving the government’s compelling public health interests\n\ndepends on overcoming the human behavioral tendencies of denial and delay\n\ndocumented in the legislative and regulatory record”).\n\n      Moreover, the Women’s Health Amendment, which added the contraceptive\n\nmandate to the ACA’s minimum coverage requirements, specifically addressed the\n\nneed to provide preventive care to women to rectify past gender discrimination in\n\nhealth insurance. As the Departments noted, “the statute acknowledges that both\n\nexisting health coverage and existing preventive services recommendations often\n\n\n                                          54\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 55 of 148\n\n\ndid not adequately serve the unique health needs of women. This disparity placed\n\nwomen in the workforce at a disadvantage compared to their male coworkers.” 36\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39873; see also 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (statement of Sen.\n\nGillibrand) (“The prevention section of the bill before us must be amended so\n\ncoverage of preventive services takes into account the unique health care needs of\n\nwomen throughout their lifespan.”). Indeed, before the ACA, “women of\n\nchildbearing age spent 68 percent more on out-of-pocket health care costs than\n\nmen.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39887. The Departments explained that this\n\n“disproportionate” financial burden “prevented women from achieving health\n\noutcomes on an equal basis with men.” Id. The Departments intended the\n\ncontraceptive coverage requirement to “help[] to equalize the provision of\n\npreventative health care services to women and, as a result, help[] women\n\ncontribute to society to the same degree as men.” Id. As the Departments\n\nexplained, “[r]esearch shows that access to contraception improves the social and\n\neconomic status of women.” Id. at 39873; see generally Claudia Goldin &\n\nLawrence F. Katz, The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives & Women’s Career\n\n& Marriage Decisions, 110 J. of Pol. Econ. 731 (2002).\n\n       36\n          See also 155 Cong. Rec. S11987 (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (“Women are often\nfaced with the punitive practices of insurance companies. No. 1 is gender discrimination.\nWomen often pay more and get less.

As\n\nexplained above, federal law generally guarantees women contraceptive coverage\n\nwithout cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4); 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725\n\n(discussing HRSA guidelines). Importantly, under the mandate and\n\naccommodation, women covered by group health insurance plans generally are\n\nrequired to take no additional action to obtain this contraceptive coverage. This is\n\nbecause the coverage is delivered “through the existing employer-based system of\n\nhealth coverage.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888. Thus, under the mandate, women need\n\nnot complete extra paperwork or sign up for an additional program because the\n\ncontraceptive coverage is delivered with the health insurance they already have\n\nthrough their employers.\n\n      This is true even when an employer opts out of providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage by seeking an accommodation. Although objecting employers are not\n\nobligated to provide or pay for contraceptives, the women covered by their plans\n\nseamlessly receive contraceptive coverage from the plans’ TPAs. This system was\n                                           56\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 57 of 148\n\n\ncarefully designed to make contraceptive coverage accessible by not requiring\n\nwomen to research plans that offer contraceptive coverage, purchase separate\n\ncontraceptive coverage, or even sign up with a different entity or program. See id.\n\nAs the Supreme Court acknowledged in Hobby Lobby, the Departments designed\n\nthe accommodation so that it has “precisely zero” impact on female plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries. 134 S. Ct. at 2760; see also id. at 2759 (explaining\n\nthe accommodation “ensur[es] that the employees of [eligible organizations] have\n\nprecisely the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of\n\ncompanies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such\n\ncoverage”).37\n\n       Providing women with such seamless coverage should result in a lower\n\nunintended pregnancy rate. Medical evidence reflects a causal relationship\n\nbetween the accessibility of contraceptives and the unintended pregnancy rate:\n\n“progress in reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy would be possible by\n\nmaking contraceptives more available, accessible, and acceptable.” IOM Report at\n\n104 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 109 (“[C]ost-sharing\n\nrequirements, such as deductibles and copayments, can pose barriers to care and\n\nresult in reduced use of preventative and primary care services, particularly for\n\n       37\n          We acknowledge that the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby expressly declined to decide\nwhether the accommodation violated RFRA. Nonetheless, our analysis is consistent with the\nCourt’s dicta.\n\n\n                                            57\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 58 of 148\n\n\nlow-income populations.”); Dianne Greene Foster, et al., Number of Oral\n\nContraceptive Pill Packages Dispensed & Subsequent Unintended Pregnancies,\n\nObstetrics & Gynecology, March 2011, at 566 (concluding that when receipt of\n\noral contraceptives was made more convenient by dispensing them annually rather\n\nthan quarterly the unintended pregnancy rate dropped by 30% and the abortion rate\n\ndropped by 46%).38 Because the government has demonstrated that the mandate\n\nand accommodation increase access to contraception, we conclude that the\n\nmandate and accommodation are effective ways to reduce the unintended\n\npregnancy rate. Accordingly, they serve the government’s compelling interests of\n\n\n       38\n           The government’s evidence further shows that when contraception is easily accessible,\nwomen not only use it more often, they select more effective methods of contraception. In\nresearch studies, “when out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives were eliminated or reduced,\nwomen were more likely to rely on more effective long-acting contraceptive methods.” IOM\nReport at 109. These methods include intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, which are\nlong-lasting and have the additional advantage of not being dependent on user compliance. See\nBirth Control Methods Fact Sheet, Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., Office on Women’s Health,\nhttp://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-\nmethods.html (July 16, 2012) (showing that implants and intrauterine devices have a failure rate\nof less than 1 percent, compared to 5 percent for oral contraceptives and 11 to 16 percent for\nmale condoms).\n        These longer-acting contraceptive methods have been underutilized in the United States\ncompared to other developed countries where unintended pregnancy rates are lower, Jeffrey F.\nPeipert, et al., Preventing Unintended Pregnancies by Providing No-Cost Contraception,\nObstetrics & Gynecology, Dec. 2012, at 1291, in large part because they pose higher up-front\ncosts that discourage use. See IOM Report at 108. Evidence shows that women’s use of long-\nacting contraceptive methods easily can be increased by making the methods cheaper and more\nreadily available. In a study that provided intrauterine devices and implanted contraceptives at\nno cost to study participants, researchers found a significant decrease in unintended pregnancy\nand abortion rates in the study population. The study concluded that “[u]nintended pregnancies\nmay be reduced by providing no-cost contraception and promoting the most effective\ncontraceptive methods.” See Peipert, supra, at 1291.\n\n\n                                               58\n\f              Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 59 of 148\n\n\nimproving the health of women and children and assuring that women receive\n\nhealth benefits that meet their needs as well as the health care provided to men\n\ndoes.\n\n        Of course, a compelling interest alone is insufficient to satisfy RFRA; we\n\nmust also assess “the marginal interest in enforcing” the challenged law against the\n\nreligious adherents in question. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2779. “RFRA requires\n\nthe Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through\n\napplication of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the particular claimant whose\n\nsincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.” Gonzales v. O Centro\n\nEspirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145684\"><a href=\"/opinion/145684/gonzales-v-o-centro-espirita-beneficente-uniao-do-vegetal/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430-31 (2006) (quoting 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b)); see also Yoder, 406 U.S. at 221 (“Where fundamental\n\nclaims of religious freedom are at stake, however, we cannot accept such a\n\nsweeping claim [of compelling interest]; despite its admitted validity in the\n\ngenerality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks\n\nto promote . . . and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from\n\nrecognizing the claimed . . . exemption.”).\n\n        Yoder provides a good example of the application of this principle. There,\n\nthe Amish plaintiffs challenged Wisconsin’s law requiring high school attendance\n\nuntil the age of 16. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 207-08. The government asserted that the\n\nlaw was justified by a general interest in the virtues of universal education. Id. at\n\n\n                                          59\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 60 of 148\n\n\n213-14. The Supreme Court was unsatisfied with this interest as it applied to the\n\nplaintiffs. “[T]he evidence adduced by the Amish . . . [was] persuasively to the\n\neffect that an additional one or two years of formal high school for Amish children\n\nin place of their long-established program of informal vocational education would\n\ndo little to serve [the government’s stated] interests.” Id. at 222 (emphasis added).\n\n      Similarly, the government’s argument in O Centro exemplifies an overly\n\ngeneralized interest. The plaintiffs, a religious sect with origins in the Amazon\n\nrainforest, challenged the Controlled Substances Act’s regulation of hoasca, a\n\nhallucinogenic tea they used in religious ceremonies. The federal government\n\nargued that it had “a compelling interest in the uniform application of the\n\nControlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the\n\nhallucinogen can be made to accommodate the sect’s sincere religious practice.” O\n\nCentro, 546 U.S. at 423. The Supreme Court dismissed this slippery slope\n\nargument, which it said “could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an\n\nexception to a generally applicable law,” because it failed to consider the limited\n\neffect of an exception for the particular plaintiffs, and its stated need for universal\n\napplication was undermined by the existence of other exceptions. Id. at 435-36.\n\n      In contrast to Yoder and O Centro, here the government’s stated interests all\n\nconcern the law’s application to these particular plaintiffs. The government argues\n\nthat applying the accommodation procedure to the plaintiffs in these cases furthers\n\n\n                                           60\n\f              Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 61 of 148\n\n\nits interests because the accommodation ensures that the plaintiffs’ female plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries—who may or may not share the same religious\n\nbeliefs as their employer—have access to contraception without cost sharing or\n\nadditional administrative burdens as the ACA requires. Unlike the exception made\n\nin Yoder for Amish children, whom the Supreme Court found had an adequate\n\nsubstitute for additional formal education to refute the government’s compelling\n\ninterest, here the IOM Report’s findings of poor health outcomes related to\n\nunintended or poorly timed pregnancies apply to the plaintiffs’ female plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries and their children just as they do to the general\n\npopulation.\n\n      Moreover, the accommodation’s requirement that the plaintiffs inform their\n\nTPAs or HHS of their religious objection is essential to achieving the\n\ngovernment’s compelling interests. It ensures that a TPA is aware when it has an\n\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage so that the women covered by these\n\nplans can receive coverage if they want it, without gaps in such coverage. The\n\nnotification also guarantees that the Departments will be able to identify objecting\n\norganizations, like the plaintiffs, to make sure that the accommodation procedures\n\nwork (that is, to independently ensure that the women covered by the plaintiffs’\n\nplans are receiving the coverage to which they are entitled). Thus, the\n\ngovernment’s interests are sufficiently particular to satisfy the O Centro standard.\n\n\n                                          61\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 62 of 148\n\n\n                           (c)    The Exceptions to the Mandate and\n                                  Accommodation Do Not Undermine the\n                                  Government’s Compelling Interest.\n\n      The plaintiffs argue that the government’s interests in providing broad\n\ncontraceptive coverage cannot be compelling because the ACA provides\n\nexemptions from the mandate for other types of employers—namely, those (1)\n\nwith grandfathered health plans, (2) with fewer than 50 employees, and (3) that\n\nqualify as “religious employers.” We disagree.\n\n      First, the existence of grandfathered plans does not undermine the\n\ngovernment’s compelling interest in providing contraceptive coverage because\n\ngrandfathered plans are only a short-lived, transitional measure intended to ease\n\nthe burden of compliance with the ACA’s sweeping reforms. 78 Fed. Reg. at\n\n39887 n.49 (“[T]he Affordable Care Act’s grandfathering provision is only\n\ntransitional in effect, and it is expected that a majority of plans will lose their\n\ngrandfathered status by the end of 2013.”). To be grandfathered, a plan must\n\ncontinue to provide virtually the same benefits for the same percentage cost\n\nsharing as the plan had in effect on March 23, 2010. 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g)(1)(ii).\n\nIt becomes difficult to comply with these requirements over time. See, e.g.,\n\nSecond Am. Compl. at 23-24, No. 1:12-cv-03489, Doc. 56 (describing the Atlanta\n\nArchdiocese’s inability to afford to maintain its grandfathered plan past January 1,\n\n2014).\n\n\n                                           62\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 63 of 148\n\n\n       Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrates that the percentage\n\nof workers covered by grandfathered plans has rapidly declined: 26 percent in\n\n2014, down from 36 percent in 2013, 48 percent in 2012, and 56 percent in 2011.\n\nKaiser Family Found. & Health Research & Ed. Trust, Employer Health Benefits\n\n2015 Annual Survey at 218 (Sept. 22, 2015). 39 In addition, some employees\n\ncovered by grandfathered plans may in fact be receiving contraceptive benefits\n\nwithout cost sharing because, though not required to do so, their plans may include\n\nsuch a benefit.\n\n       As an additional consideration, we do not wish to penalize the government\n\nfor phasing in the ACA’s requirements to help businesses adjust to a new health\n\ncare regulatory landscape.

Accordingly, even if the mandate and accommodation are phased in\n\n\n\n       39\n          We acknowledge that the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2015 data shows that 25% of\ncovered workers are enrolled in a grandfathered plan, which is not much less than the 26% in\n2014. But the Foundation reported that many employers were confused and unsure about\nwhether their plans remained grandfathered, suggesting that employers may have inaccurately\nreported that they had grandfathered plans.

If, on the one hand, smaller\n\nemployers do not provide insurance coverage, then their employees must purchase\n\nhealth plans on the health insurance exchanges or face tax penalties. See id.\n\n§ 5000A(a), (b)(1). And plans purchased on the exchanges will include\n\ncontraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). If, on the other hand,\n\nsmaller employers choose to provide health insurance, then their plans are subject\n\nto the contraceptive mandate. See id. The employees of small businesses therefore\n\nwill receive contraceptive coverage regardless of whether their employers are\n\nexempt from providing health insurance. This exemption reflects a practical\n\nrecognition that small businesses have different financial realities from larger\n\nbusinesses. It in no way undermines the government’s interest in providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing because small businesses’ employees\n\nend up with health plans subject to the contraceptive mandate whether the\n\nemployers provide health insurance or not.\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 65 of 148\n\n\n      Third, the exemption from the contraceptive mandate for religious\n\nemployers does not weaken the government’s stated interests. Under the HRSA\n\nguidelines, the contraceptive mandate does not apply to a group health plan run by\n\na religious employer, defined by the regulations as “an organization that is\n\norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section\n\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). In finalizing the regulations, the Departments declined to\n\nextend the exemption to other organizations that have religious objections to the\n\nmandate because:\n\n      Houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to\n      contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than\n      other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the\n      same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other\n      people to use contraceptive services even if such services were\n      covered under their plan.\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39874.\n\n       The exemption for religious employers attempts to balance the need for\n\ncontraceptive coverage with our nation’s longstanding history of deferring to a\n\nhouse of worship’s decisions about its internal affairs. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 46623\n\n(“[T]he Departments seek to provide for a religious accommodation that respects\n\nthe unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in\n\nministerial positions.”); see also Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &\n\nSch. v.

The government\n\nundoubtedly has a compelling interest in respecting the values of religious\n\nemployers and their employees, and pursuing that interest does not undermine the\n\ngovernment’s equally compelling interest in improving women’s and the public’s\n\nhealth by making contraceptives easier to obtain. Especially with regard to\n\nsweeping legislation like the ACA, the government is often faced with competing\n\ncompelling interests. Courts may allow the government to balance those interests\n\nwithout undermining any individual compelling interest. See Hobby Lobby,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2780 (“Even a compelling interest may be outweighed in some\n\ncircumstances by another even weightier consideration.”).\n\n       We also reject the plaintiffs’ argument that the Departments’ distinction\n\nbetween houses of worship (which are exempted from the mandate) and other\n\norganizations with religious affiliation (which must seek an accommodation) is\n\nillogical. Although it may not universally hold true,40 it is a common-sense notion\n\nthat a church’s employees likely share more beliefs with the church than do the\n\nemployees of, for example, a school linked to that church, and therefore the\n\nemployees of a church that objects to contraception are less likely to use\n\ncontraceptive coverage even if it is available. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. Thus,\n\n       40\n         EWTN in particular argues that the Departments’ distinction between houses of\nworship and other religious organizations is illogical and does not hold for EWTN because, like\nemployees of “religious employers,” its employees share its religious convictions.\n\n\n                                               66\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 67 of 148\n\n\nthe Departments distinguished between houses of worship and other religious\n\ngroups using the readily available and well-established IRS tax status test.

We do not think that the Departments’\n\ndecision to exempt houses of worship based on a bright-line test while\n\naccommodating other religious organizations undercuts the government’s\n\ncompelling interests in enforcing the contraceptive mandate.\n\n      In sum, the mandate and accommodation further the government’s\n\ncompelling interests by ensuring that women have contraceptive coverage without\n\ncost sharing or additional administrative hurdles. Additionally, by requiring\n\norganizations that opt out of the mandate to identify themselves, the government\n\nensures that these organizations’ health plan participants and beneficiaries can\n\nreceive the coverage seamlessly through other channels. Although the government\n\nhas attempted to accommodate religious freedom as well as the needs of\n\nbusinesses, it has not done so in a way that undermines its goal of ensuring access\n\nto contraception.\n\n\n                                          67\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 68 of 148\n\n\n                    (ii)   The Mandate and Accommodation Are the Least\n                           Restrictive Means of Furthering the Government’s\n                           Compelling Interests.\n\n      As a final step, we must determine whether the mandate and accommodation\n\nare “the least restrictive means of furthering” the government’s compelling\n\ninterests. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). This test is “exceptionally demanding.”\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780.

Because there are no less restrictive means\n\navailable that serve the government’s interests equally well, we hold that the\n\nmandate and accommodation survive strict scrutiny under RFRA.\n\n      Although the plaintiffs and the dissent suggest several potential less\n\nrestrictive alternatives to the mandate and accommodation, their proposals fail to\n\nachieve the government’s interests as effectively. Indeed, their proposals impose\n\nburdens on women that would make contraceptives less accessible than they\n\ncurrently are. Because these proposals cannot be expected to reduce the rate of\n\nunintended pregnancies and thereby improve the health of women and children as\n\neffectively as the mandate and accommodation, they do not qualify as less\n\nrestrictive alternatives under RFRA.\n\n      Previously, the Supreme Court and a member of this Court suggested that a\n\nless restrictive alternative would be to allow eligible organizations to notify HHS\n\nof their opt out, instead of having to provide Form 700 to their plan providers or\n\nTPAs. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807; Eternal Word Television Network,\n\n756 F.3d at 1349 (William Pryor, J., concurring) (“The United States, for example,\n\ncould require the Network to provide a written notification of its religious\n\n\n                                          69\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 70 of 148\n\n\nobjection to the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of requiring\n\nthe Network to submit Form 700—an instrument under which the health insurance\n\nplan is operated—to the third-party administrator.”). The Departments have\n\nresponded to and addressed this concern by revising the accommodation\n\nprocedures to allow eligible organizations notify HHS directly of their desire to opt\n\nout of the contraceptive mandate. 79 Fed. Reg. at 51094-95. With that potential\n\nalternative incorporated into the regulatory scheme, we turn to the alternatives\n\nproposed by the plaintiffs and the dissent.\n\n                             (a)     The Plaintiffs’ Proposals\n\n       The plaintiffs propose two less restrictive alternatives. First, they suggest\n\nthat the government could pay directly for all contraceptive coverage, in effect a\n\nsingle-payer system for contraceptives only, 41 either by creating a new government\n\nprogram or expanding an existing one.42 Either way Congress would need to pass\n\nlegislation that would fundamentally change how the majority of American women\n\n\n       41\n          In a single-payer system, the government—as opposed to employers, health insurers, or\npatients—pays for healthcare services. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 615; Single-Payer,\nMerriam Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single-payer (last\nvisited Feb. 12, 2016). Although the plaintiffs never call their proposal a “single-payer” system\nfor contraceptives, the label applies because they propose a system in which the government\nwould be the sole payer for contraceptives and related services. It is important to note that all\nother health care would continue to be provided through our existing system.\n       42\n          The plaintiffs suggest, for example, that Congress could expand Title X, which\ncurrently benefits only low-income families; patients whose income exceeds 250 percent of the\npoverty level must pay for any services they receive through Title X programs. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300a-4(c); 42 C.F.R. § 59.5(a)(8).\n\n\n                                               70\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 71 of 148\n\n\nreceive their healthcare coverage for contraception. 43 See Jessica C. Smith & Carla\n\nMedalia, U.S. Census Bureau, Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S.: 2014 at 3\n\n(2015) (55% of Americans had insurance coverage provided by an employer in\n\n2014). Among other things, adopting a single-payer system for contraception\n\nwould require Congress to squeeze insurance companies out of an entire segment\n\nof the health insurance business. 44 Second, the plaintiffs assert that the\n\ngovernment could provide tax credits to reimburse women for purchasing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 45 Under either the single-payer or tax credit proposals, all\n\ncoverage for contraception and related services would operate outside the existing,\n\nlargely employer-based, insurance system.\n\n\n\n\n       43\n           In Hobby Lobby, the government argued that RFRA does not permit the court to\nconsider proposals that would require the government to create entirely new programs as less\nrestrictive alternatives. The Court rejected this argument, explaining “we see nothing in RFRA\nthat supports this argument.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781. Accordingly, we consider this\nproposal even though it would require substantial congressional action to expand significantly an\nexisting program or create a new one.\n       44\n          We may, of course, consider the burdens that a proposed alternative places on\nnonbeneficiaries, such as insurance companies. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720-722\n(2005) (“[A]pplying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries. . . . Our decisions indicate that an\naccommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests.”).\n       45\n         The plaintiffs suggest the government could require women to purchase separate\ncontraceptive coverage on the healthcare exchanges and then offer tax credits to offset the cost of\npurchasing the coverage. This proposal would require Congress to amend the ACA because the\nexchanges are statutorily restricted to selling only full health insurance policies. See 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 18021(a)(1)(B), 18022(a), (b).\n\n\n                                                71\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 72 of 148\n\n\n       Most importantly, these proposals are not less restrictive alternatives\n\nbecause they would not serve the government’s interests “equally well.” 46 Hobby\n\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2782. As the Departments explain, these proposals would\n\ncause all women who have existing contraceptive coverage through group health\n\ninsurance plans to lose such coverage, forcing them instead to “take steps to learn\n\nabout, and to sign up for, a new health benefit.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888. Indeed,\n\nunder these proposals, women would have one employer-provided health insurance\n\nplan covering healthcare other than contraception. Then, they would have to take\n\nadditional, separate steps to secure contraceptives or contraceptive coverage.\n\nUnder a single-payer system for contraceptives, they would have to research the\n\nfederal entitlement for contraceptives and register for the program. Under a tax-\n\ncredit system, they would have to research plans offering separate contraceptive\n\ncoverage, select a plan, purchase coverage, and later file for a tax credit as part of\n\ntheir individual tax returns. 47 The mandate and accommodation present an easier,\n\n\n       46\n           We acknowledge dicta in Hobby Lobby suggesting as a less restrictive alternative that\nthe government pay directly for contraception; however, the Supreme Court did not hold that\nsuch a program was a less restrictive alternative. 134 S. Ct. at 2871-82 (“[W]e need not rely on\nthe option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations\nfail the least-restrictive-means test.”).\n       47\n           The tax-credit proposal is particularly problematic because it forces women to pay up\nfront for contraceptives in exchange for tax credits later. But many women simply would not be\nable to afford to wait a year for a refund from the government in the form of a tax credit and, as\nthe government’s evidence shows, would instead have to forgo using contraceptives. See IOM\nReport at 109 (recognizing that “cost-sharing requirements, such as deductibles and copayments,\ncan pose barriers to care and result in reduced use of preventive . . . services”); see also supra\n\n\n                                                72\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 73 of 148\n\n\nsimpler, and more certain path for women by ensuring that, by obtaining health\n\ninsurance, they also secure contraceptive coverage, even when their employers opt\n\nout.\n\n       Because plaintiffs’ proposals impose greater barriers to contraceptive access\n\nthan exist under the mandate and accommodation, their proposals likely will lead\n\nto lower rates of contraceptive usage (along with use of less effective forms of\n\ncontraception), meaning these proposals will be less effective at preventing\n\nunintended pregnancies and concomitant health consequences. 48 See IOM Report\n\nat 104-09; Foster, supra, at 566 (reflecting that when obtaining contraceptives\n\nbecame less convenient, the rate of unintended pregnancy increased); see also\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39888 (recognizing that these proposals would be “less effective\n\nthan the employer-based system of health coverage in advancing the government’s\n\ncompelling interests”).\n\n       Plaintiffs’ proposals would make contraception less accessible not only to\n\nwomen who currently receive contraceptive coverage through a group insurance\n\n\nnote 38. In contrast, the mandate and accommodation require women to pay nothing upfront for\ncontraceptives. Accordingly, contraceptives are significantly more available to women under the\nmandate and accommodation than they would be under the tax-credit proposal.\n       48\n          The two other circuit courts to address this issue have rejected similar alternatives for\nthe same reason. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 616-17 (rejecting similar proposed alternatives\nbecause they “would impede the receipt of [contraceptive] benefits”); Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d\nat 265 (holding that proposed alternatives “would not serve the government’s compelling interest\nwith anywhere near the efficacy of the challenged accommodation and would instead deter\nwomen from accessing contraception”).\n\n\n                                                73\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 74 of 148\n\n\nplan, but also to women who currently purchase health insurance through the\n\nexchanges, including women who work for an employer with fewer than 50 full-\n\ntime employees. Under the current framework, these women must research and\n\ncompare potential health insurance plans sold on the exchanges and then purchase\n\nand sign up for a plan. As a result of their efforts, they receive health insurance\n\nthat includes contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). Under the\n\nplaintiffs’ proposals, these women would still have to procure health insurance\n\nfrom the exchanges. But then they would have to take the additional steps\n\ndescribed above to obtain coverage for contraceptives. In other words, women\n\nwho currently purchase insurance through the exchanges would also face greater\n\nburdens accessing contraceptives under a single-payer system. 49\n\n\n       49\n          It is unclear whether our dissenting colleague advocates as a less restrictive alternative\nreplacing our insurance-based system with a single-payer system for contraceptive coverage. On\nthe one hand, the dissent never states that a single-payer system would be a less restrictive\nalternative, instead proposing that the ACA and ERISA need only a “slight[] tweak,” not the\njettisoning of our insurance-based system for contraceptives that a single-payer system would\nentail. Dissent at 137. On the one other hand, the dissent argues that the government should\n“provid[e] for contraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation’s administrative\nrigmarole” so that the government could “offer cost-free access to each and every woman in the\nUnited States.” Id. at 134. This sounds to us like a single-payer system.\n        Indeed, the dissent suggests that a single-payer system would be as effective or more\neffective than the mandate and accommodation at making contraceptives accessible to women.\nBecause under either system women pay nothing for contraceptives, to compare women’s access\nto contraceptives under the two systems, we must focus on the administrative burdens that\nwomen face under either system.\n        We conclude that, on the whole, women face fewer barriers to obtaining contraceptives\nunder the mandate and accommodation than they would under a single-payer system. Most\nsignificantly, most women covered by group health insurance plans and all who purchase\ninsurance on the exchanges seamlessly receive coverage under the mandate and accommodation.\n\n\n                                                74\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 75 of 148\n\n\n       After careful consideration, we conclude that the government has shown that\n\ncontraceptives would be less accessible—and used less frequently or effectively—\n\nunder the plaintiffs’ proposals then they are under the mandate and\n\n\nNonetheless, the dissent asserts that a single-payer system is a more effective way to improve\naccess to contraceptives because three categories of women whose employers are exempt from\nthe contraceptive mandate—(1) women employed by small businesses, (2) women covered by\ngrandfathered plans, and (3) women employed by churches or church-affiliated organizations—\nwould have greater access to contraceptives under such a system. See id. at 50. After\nconsidering these three categories, we remain convinced that a single-payer system would be less\neffective than the mandate and accommodation.\n        First, the dissent suggests that women whose employers have 50 or fewer full-time\nemployees would receive better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But, as we\nexplained above, these women receive contraceptive coverage under the mandate and\naccommodation regardless of whether their employers elect to provide health insurance coverage\nor they purchase a plan on the exchanges. See supra Part III.A.2.c.(i).(c). Given that these\nwomen currently have seamless access to contraceptives, we fail to see how this group supports\nthe dissent’s argument.\n        Second, the dissent asserts that women whose health plans have a grandfathered\nexemption would have better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But the\ndissent overlooks that the grandfathered exemption is a temporary measure, meaning the number\nof women covered by plans subject to the exemption has rapidly declined and should continue to\ndecline over time because it becomes more expensive for plans to maintain their grandfathered\nstatus. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(g)(1) (requiring grandfathered plans to provide virtually the\nsame benefits for the same percentage cost sharing that the plan had in effect on March 2010).\nWe cannot say that a single-payer system serves the government’s interest as effectively or more\neffectively simply because in the short term a subset of women may have easier access to\ncontraceptives under a single-payer system.\n         Third, the dissent argues that women employed by churches and church-affiliated\norganizations would have easier access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. Even if\nthat is true for this relatively small group of women, the Departments have explained that these\nemployees are likely to share their employer’s religious objection to contraception, meaning they\nare “less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were\ncovered under the plan.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. All together, we cannot say that a single-payer\nsystem serves the government’s interest as effectively as the mandate and accommodation when\nwe consider that a single-payer system would impose greater barriers to accessing contraceptives\nfor most women who purchase health insurance from an employer and all women who purchase\nplans on the exchanges. What’s more, the balance tips even further in favor of the mandate and\naccommodation when we consider the impact of imposing on non-beneficiaries a single-payer\nsystem for an entire segment of preventative care. See Cutter, 544 U.S. at 720.\n\n\n                                               75\n\f                Case: 14-12696   Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 76 of 148\n\n\naccommodation. Given the government’s compelling interest in minimizing the\n\nbarriers women face in accessing contraceptives so that they will use\n\ncontraceptives to lower the rate of unintended pregnancies, we conclude that the\n\nplaintiffs’ proposals would not serve the government’s interest equally as well as\n\nthe mandate and accommodation. Thus, they fail to qualify as less restrictive\n\nalternatives.\n\n      The dissent criticizes our position as giving the Departments a “free pass” on\n\nthe least restrictive means requirement. Dissent at 139. Our dissenting colleague\n\ntakes our analysis to mean that the government can defeat a potential alternative\n\nmerely by showing that the alternative would take away a benefit—any benefit—\n\nthat the government’s existing framework provides to “third parties” (here, the\n\nwomen who are the intended beneficiaries of the mandate and accommodation).\n\nId. at 138. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying that the\n\ngovernment can always overcome strict scrutiny by showing that proposed\n\nalternatives would take away a benefit that the current framework provides.\n\nRather, on the facts and record of this case—including the evidence that when\n\nwomen face greater burdens (whether financial or administrative) in accessing\n\ncontraceptives or contraceptive coverage, they are less likely to use\n\ncontraceptives—we must conclude that plaintiffs’ alternatives, which make\n\ncontraceptives less accessible, would be significantly less effective than the\n\n\n                                           76\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 77 of 148\n\n\nmandate and accommodation at reducing the rate of unintended pregnancies and\n\nthus would thwart the government’s interests.50\n\n                              (b)    The Dissent’s Proposal\n\n       The dissent suggests that Congress could “slightly tweak” the ACA and\n\nERISA to “eliminate the need for eligible organizations to affirmatively designate\n\nthe third-party administrators of their health plans.” Dissent at 137. We\n\nunderstand the dissent’s proposal to be that Congress should pass legislation and\n\nthe Departments should enact regulations that would designate the TPA for a self-\n\ninsured eligible organization as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive\n\ncoverage without requiring the eligible organization to communicate its religious\n\nobjection to anyone.\n\n       The dissent’s proposal fails to serve the government’s interest equally as\n\nwell as the accommodation because the alternative would make contraceptives less\n\naccessible to women covered by eligible organizations’ plans than would the\n\naccommodation. The dissent fails to explain—and we cannot imagine—how a\n\nTPA would know when an employer has a religious objection to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the proposal and thus that the TPA is required to\n\n\n       50\n          The Eighth Circuit’s proposal that “the government could pay for the distribution of\ncontraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals with income-based\nsupport” likewise would impose additional administrative burdens on women and thus in a\nsimilar way fails to satisfy the government’s interests. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 945.\n\n\n                                               77\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 78 of 148\n\n\nprovide the coverage in the employer’s stead if the employer is not required to\n\nnotify anyone. Like the TPAs, the government must also be able to identify\n\nwomen whose employers object on religious grounds to providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage. Otherwise, the government will be unable to ensure that the participants\n\nand beneficiaries of the abstaining organization’s health insurance plan receive the\n\ncoverage the law mandates. Without an effective way to identify any gaps, the\n\ngovernment would be hamstrung in its ability to accommodate employers’\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs while also pursuing the interests that Congress\n\nintended to achieve in passing the Women’s Health Amendment. 51\n\n\n\n\n       51\n          The Eighth Circuit suggested as a less restrictive alternative that the Departments\nrevise the regulations governing the accommodation to remove the requirement that when\nnotifying HHS of its religious objection, an eligible organization must identify its TPA and\nprovide the TPA’s contact information. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 944. The Eighth Circuit\nconcluded that this alternative would be “less onerous” than the current regulations yet “permit[]\nthe government to further its interests.” Id. The Eighth Circuit relied on the fact that when the\nSupreme Court in Wheaton College created an accommodation, the Court required the college\nonly to notify HHS that it had an objection to providing coverage for contraceptive services, and\nnot to identify its TPA. Id.\n        We disagree with the Eighth Circuit that this alternative would serve HHS’s interests\nequally well. As the Departments explained, the information required under the regulations is\n“necessary for the Departments to determine which entities are covered by the accommodation,\nto administer the accommodation, and to implement the policies in the . . . final regulations.”\n79 Fed. Reg. at 51095. The Eighth Circuit has not explained why this is not so. Although the\nSupreme Court in Wheaton College did not require the college to identify its TPA to HHS to\nreceive an accommodation, the information was unnecessary because HHS already knew the\nidentity of the college’s TPA. See Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2815 (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting) (“HHS is aware of Wheaton’s third-party administrator in this case.”). Thus,\nWheaton College does not suggest that HHS could administer the mandate and accommodation\nin other cases without requiring an eligible organization to identify its TPA.\n\n\n                                                78\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 79 of 148\n\n\n       The dissent’s proposal would create gaps or delays in contraceptive\n\ncoverage for plan participants and beneficiaries of eligible organizations that refuse\n\nto provide contraceptive coverage or tell anyone of their objection. Until the\n\ninsured, the TPA, or HHS learned of the silent omission of contraceptive coverage,\n\nthese women would be denied the contraceptive coverage to which they are\n\nirrefutably entitled. During this period, such eligible organizations would, in\n\neffect, be imposing their religious beliefs on women who wish to take advantage of\n\ntheir rights under federal law. These gaps in contraceptive coverage would\n\nfrustrate the government’s interests. Because the dissent’s proposal substantially\n\nburdens religious exercise and fails to meet the government’s compelling interests,\n\nit cannot constitute a less restrictive alternative.52\n\n\n\n       52\n          We pause to note that if we assume that the dissent’s substantial burden analysis is\ncorrect—meaning the only objective inquiry for determining whether there is a substantial\nburden is the magnitude of the penalty, see Dissent at 116—then the dissent’s proposal would\nsubstantially burden the plaintiffs’ religious exercise. Presumably the dissent’s position is that\nthe proposal presents a satisfactory alternative because it requires no “affirmative participation”\nby the objecting organization. Id. at 139. In fact, though, a TPA’s obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage to a specific plan participant or beneficiary would remain tied to and—in\nsome limited way—“triggered” by actions taken by the organization. An eligible organization is\nrequired to take two actions before its TPA becomes obligated to provide contraceptive coverage\nto a specific plan participant or beneficiary: the eligible organization must (1) contract with a\nspecific TPA to provide administrative services for its plan and (2) notify the TPA of the\nindividuals covered by its plan. Unless an eligible organization hired a specific TPA and\nprovided a list of its insureds, those insureds would never receive contraceptive coverage from\nthe TPA, even under the dissent’s proposal. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 617 (explaining that\nunder a similar proposal when a university hired an unemployed person who “by virtue of\nbecoming employed by [the organization], obtained contraception coverage for the first time,”\nthe university’s acts would “‘trigger[]’ the new employee’s access to contraception”).\n\n\n                                                79\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 80 of 148\n\n\n       We hold that, even if the accommodation substantially burdens the\n\nplaintiffs’ religious exercise, it does not violate RFRA because it is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering the government’s compelling interests in the\n\ncontraceptive mandate.\n\n\n\n\nB.     EWTN’S Free Exercise Claims\n\n       Plaintiff-appellant EWTN additionally claims that the contraceptive mandate\n\nviolates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court’s\n\nSmith decision continues to apply to Free Exercise claims outside of the RFRA\n\ncontext; thus, neutral and generally applicable laws need not be justified by any\n\ncompelling interest even if those laws incidentally burden religious exercise.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 885. A law is neutral unless “the object of a law is to infringe\n\nupon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation.” Lukumi Babalu\n\n         The plaintiffs’ religious objections to taking acts that “trigger[]” contraceptive coverage,\n“facilitat[e]” access to contraceptives, or render them “complicit” in a scheme that provides\naccess to contraceptives apply with equal force to the dissent’s proposal. See EWTN Reply Br.\nat 5, 10-11; Catholic Charities and CENGI Appellee Br. at 10, 13, 20. Indeed, Catholic Charities\nand CENGI alleged in their complaint that their “religious beliefs prohibit them from contracting\nwith [a] . . . third-party administrator that will, as a direct result, procure or provide the\nobjectionable coverage to [their] employees.” Second Am. Compl. at 49, No. 1:12-cv-03489-\nWSD, Doc. 56. We acknowledge that the dissent’s proposal does not require an eligible\norganization to tell HHS or its TPA that it has a religious objection to providing contraceptive\ncoverage. But the plaintiffs do not claim that the government imposes a substantial burden by\nforcing them to state that they have a religious objection. Rather, they claim a substantial burden\nbecause, they assert, their objection would cause their TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n                                                 80\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 81 of 148\n\n\nAye, 508 U.S. at 533. And a law is generally applicable if it does not “in a\n\nselective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.”\n\nId. at 543. “A law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified by a\n\ncompelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that\n\ninterest.” Id. at 531-32. But if a law indeed is neutral and generally applicable,\n\n“then rational basis scrutiny should be applied, requiring that the plaintiff show\n\nthat there is not a legitimate government interest or that the law is not rationally\n\nrelated to protect that interest.” GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1244</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1255 n.21 (11th Cir. 2012).\n\n      Congress included the contraceptive mandate in the ACA to improve\n\nwomen’s health and public health generally. There is no evidence whatsoever that\n\nthe mandate was enacted in an attempt to restrict religious exercise. To the\n\ncontrary, in implementing the contraceptive mandate the Departments have\n\nattempted to accommodate religious interests by granting exceptions for religious\n\nemployers and those organizations with religious objections to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. EWTN nonetheless argues that the mandate is non-neutral\n\nbecause the exemption and accommodation “discriminate[] among religious\n\nobjectors, creating a three-tiered system.” EWTN Appellant Br. at 54. But the\n\nregulations do not discriminate between religious denominations or infringe upon\n\nor restrict conduct because of its religious motivation. Rather, the procedures\n\n\n                                          81\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 82 of 148\n\n\ndistinguish among organizations on the basis of their tax status. Thus EWTN has\n\nfailed to show that the mandate is non-neutral.\n\n      EWTN also argues that the mandate is not generally applicable because the\n\nACA carves out small employers and grandfathered plans. For the same reasons\n\nwe rejected this argument as it pertains to the plaintiffs’ RFRA claim, we reject it\n\nhere. Just as these exceptions do not undermine the government’s compelling\n\ninterests justifying the contraceptive mandate, they do not prevent the mandate\n\nfrom being generally applicable as defined by Lukumi Babalu Aye. The exceptions\n\nfor small businesses and grandfathered plans apply equally to religious employers\n\nand non-religious employers. The exceptions in no way “impose burdens only on\n\nconduct motivated by religious belief.” Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 543.\n\n      Because the contraceptive mandate is neutral and generally applicable, to\n\ninvalidate it the plaintiff must show that is it not rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernment interest. See GeorgiaCarry.Org, 687 F.3d at 1255 n.21. EWTN\n\ncannot make such a showing. We have already concluded that the government has\n\na compelling (and therefore legitimate) interest in ensuring women have access to\n\ncontraceptives without cost sharing. See supra Part III.A.2.c.(i). The mandate is\n\nclearly rationally related to that interest and thus passes muster under the Free\n\nExercise Clause.\n\nC.    EWTN’S Establishment Clause Claim\n\n\n                                           82\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 83 of 148\n\n\n      EWTN next argues that the contraceptive mandate violates the\n\nEstablishment Clause by discriminating among religious organizations.\n\nSpecifically, EWTN objects to the way the exemption and accommodation\n\ndistinguish between houses of worship and other types of religious organizations.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Supreme Court “has long recognized that the government\n\nmay (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so\n\nwithout violating the Establishment Clause.” Hobbie v.

Instead, the\n\nCourt should simply acknowledge that the religious purpose of such a statute is\n\nlegitimated by the Free Exercise Clause.”).\n\n      Like its claim based on the Free Exercise Clause, EWTN’s Establishment\n\nClause claim fails because the accommodation does not distinguish among\n\nreligious groups on the basis of denomination, but rather on non-denominational\n\nattributes of an objecting organization. The accommodation relies on tax status,\n\nwhich is a permissible way to distinguish between organizations for the purpose of\n\ndrafting a religious exemption. “[R]eligious employers, defined as in the cited\n\nregulation, have long enjoyed advantages (notably tax advantages) over other\n\n\n                                          83\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 84 of 148\n\n\nentities, without these advantages being thought to violate the establishment\n\nclause.” Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 443 (alteration in original and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Walz v.

We therefore reject EWTN’s\n\nEstablishment Clause challenge.\n\nD.     EWTN’S Free Speech Claim\n\n       Lastly, EWTN contends that the contraceptive mandate violates the Free\n\nSpeech Clause by compelling the organization to speak in order to avail itself of\n\nthe accommodation.53 “[T]he right of freedom of thought protected by the First\n\nAmendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the\n\nright to refrain from speaking at all.” Wooley v.

In Wooley, the plaintiff objected to the slogan on New Hampshire’s\n\nlicense plate: “Live Free or Die.” Id. at 707-08.

Id.\n\nat 716. Our disposition of the plaintiffs’ RFRA claims decides the issue. Because\n\nthe government has a compelling interest in ensuring that women have access to\n\ncontraceptive care without additional financial or administrative burden, it may\n\nforce the plaintiffs to speak simply to opt out of the mandate.\n\n                               IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n      We hold that the accommodation for the contraceptive mandate does not\n\nviolate RFRA because it does not substantially burden the plaintiffs’ religious\n\nexercise and because the government’s regulatory scheme is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering its compelling interests. The regulations also do not violate\n\nthe Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the First\n\nAmendment. With regard to EWTN, we affirm the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to the government. With regard to CENGI and Catholic\n\nCharities, we vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment on the\n\n\n                                          85\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 86 of 148\n\n\nplaintiffs’ RFRA claim and remand to the district court with instructions to grant\n\nthe government’s summary judgment motion.\n\n                                        ***\n\n      The question of whether the mandate and accommodation violate RFRA is\n\ncurrently before the Supreme Court in Zubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14- 1376 and 14-\n\n1377, and other consolidated cases. The Supreme Court will hold oral argument in\n\nthese cases on March 23, 2016. Because the Supreme Court will soon render a\n\ndecision addressing this issue, we believe it is appropriate to stay enforcement of\n\nthe mandate and accommodation against the plaintiffs until the Supreme Court\n\nissues a decision. Accordingly, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is\n\nenjoined from enforcing against EWTN, Catholic Charities, and CENGI the\n\nsubstantive requirements set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) and from\n\nassessing fines or taking other enforcement action against EWTN, Catholic\n\nCharities, or CENGI for non-compliance.

I write\n\nseparately only to emphasize one point already made in the opinion. Plaintiffs\n\nseem to suggest, as a less restrictive means, that a religious employer be allowed to\n\nopt out without notifying anyone – without requiring even the de minimis notice to\n\nHealth and Human Services (“HHS”) pursuant to the most recent alternative notice\n\nprovided for in the Regulations. However, the necessary consequence of such an\n\nautomatic opt-out would be the imposition of plaintiffs’ religious beliefs on their\n\nfemale employees. In other words, if HHS were not able to identify which\n\nemployers have opted out, the employees of such employers would not receive\n\ncontraceptive coverage, at least until they happened to sua sponte discover that\n\ntheir employer had opted out, and until such employees happened to sua sponte\n\ndiscover their statutory entitlement. Only then would such employees be in\n\nposition to notify HHS, and begin their coverage. Such an automatically exempted\n\nemployer – notifying no one of its decision to opt out -- would at least temporarily\n\nimpose its own religious beliefs on its employees and deprive them of the coverage\n\nto which they are entitled under the statute and regulations. RFRA does not\n\nrequire that construction of the law. Rather, the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby\n\nrecognized that “RFRA took the position that ‘the compelling interest test as set\n\nforth in prior Federal rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances\n\n                                          90\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 91 of 148\n\n\nbetween religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.’” Burwell v.\n\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">__, __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2681317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2681317/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For\n\ncontinued “noncompliance” after receiving a “notice of examination,” employers\n\nare subject to a minimum penalty in the amount of $2,500 or $15,000 per affected\n\nemployee, depending on whether the violations “are more than de minimis.” Id.\n\n§ 4980D(b)(3).\n\n        Included in the ACA’s definition of “minimum essential coverage” are a\n\nnumber of preventive healthcare services.

As is true generally of the\n\nACA, the contraceptive mandate does not cover employers with less than fifty full-\n\ntime employees. See 26 U.S.C. § 4890H(a), (c)(2). These employers are thus\n\nunder no obligation to provide any health plan at all. Similarly, employers who\n\nmaintain “grandfathered health plans”—health plans that have not undergone\n\nspecified changes in the way they operated before March 23, 2010, see 75 Fed.\n\nReg. 34538, 34540–41—are specifically exempted from the contraceptive\n\nmandate. 42 U.S.C. § 18011(a), (e). Other changes instituted by the ACA do\n\napply to grandfathered health plans, including extensions of dependent coverage\n\nfor adult children under the age of twenty-six and prohibitions on excessive\n\nwaiting periods, lifetime benefits limits, and rescissions of coverage. Id.\n\n§ 18011(a)(4)(A)(i)–(iv). The ACA does not include a sunset provision for\n\ngrandfathered health plans, which can continue their exempt status indefinitely. 4\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         The Government does predict that grandfathered health plans will be phased out over\ntime as part of a planned “transition period” designed “to avoid undue disruption.” It is\nultimately an empirical question how many grandfathered plans are currently in effect and how\nmany will persist in the future. The record developed in this case, as in so many other respects,\nbetrays no answer.\n\n                                                97\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 98 of 148\n\n\n       Conscious of the bind in which the contraceptive mandate would place\n\ncertain employers with religious objections, the Departments promulgated a series\n\nof further regulations to exempt these employers as well. 5 What emerged from\n\nseveral years of rulemaking were two distinct regimes for employers with religious\n\nobjections: one for “religious employers” and another for “eligible organizations.”\n\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a), (b). “Religious employers” are defined, by reference to\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code, as “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and\n\nconventions or associations of churches” and any “nonprofit entit[ies]” engaged in\n\n“the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” Id. § 147.131(a); 26\n\nU.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii).6 Employers who object to the contraceptive\n\nmandate but are not considered “religious employers” can still qualify as “eligible\n\norganizations” if they meet the following requirements:\n\n       (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of\n       any contraceptive items or services required to be covered under\n       § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account of religious objections.\n\n\n       5\n          The development of the current iteration of the contraceptive mandate—which has\nchanged multiple times since these suits was first brought, though not in ways that materially\nalter the RFRA inquiry—has been largely defined by how to treat religiously objecting\nemployers, inspiring hundreds of thousands of comments from interested stakeholders.

Compare 45 C.F.R. § 147.131, with 45 C.F.R. § 147.131 (effective Aug.\n27, 2014 to Sept. 13, 2015), and 45 C.F.R. § 147.131 (effective Aug. 1, 2013 to Aug. 26, 2014).\nThe relevant portion of § 147.131 now provides in full:\n        (b) Eligible organizations. An eligible organization is an organization that meets\n        the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.\n                (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n        contraceptive items or services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n        on account of religious objections.\n                (2)      (i) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity\n        and holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n                         (ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held\n        for-profit entity, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the\n        organization's highest governing body (such as its board of directors, board of\n        trustees, or owners, if managed directly by its owners) has adopted a resolution or\n        similar action, under the organization's applicable rules of governance and\n        consistent with state law, establishing that it objects to covering some or all of the\n        contraceptive services on account of the owners' sincerely held religious beliefs.\n                (3) The organization must self-certify in the form and manner specified by\n        the Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n        Services as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The organization must make\n        such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request by the first\n        day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this\n        section applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person\n\n                                               99\n\f            Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 100 of 148\n\n\n      Religious employers’ and eligible organizations’ bids to remove themselves\n\nfrom the contraceptive mandate fare differently. Religious employers are simply\n\nexempt; they are not required to participate, directly or indirectly, in providing\n\naccess to contraceptive coverage to their female employees and beneficiaries,\n\nwhether or not these women share their employers’ beliefs. 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 147.131(a). Eligible organizations, in contrast, are required to affirmatively opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage, if they wish to do so, by complying with a\n\nfurther series of regulations known as “the accommodation.” Id. § 147.131(c).\n\n      How the accommodation functions turns on the eligible organization’s type\n\nof health plan. Broadly speaking, employer-sponsored health plans come in two\n\ntypes: insured plans and self-insured plans. Under an insured plan, the employer\n\nenters into a contract with an insurer. The insurer, in exchange for up-front\n\npremiums, becomes responsible for administering the plan and paying out claims.\n\nUnder a self-insured plan, the employer remains responsible for paying its\n\nemployees’ claims itself; in essence, the employer serves as its own insurer. For\n\nemployers with self-insured plans, it is a common practice to contract with a third-\n\nparty administrator—which may also be in the business of providing insured\n\nplans—to administer the self-insured plan, though the employer continues to bear\n\n\n      authorized to make the certification or notice on behalf of the organization, and\n      must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements\n      under section 107 of ERISA.\n\n                                             100\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 101 of 148\n\n\nthe cost of paying claims. 8 Eligible organizations that maintain their own self-\n\ninsured plans without a third-party administrator are, like religious employers,\n\nexempt from the contraceptive mandate altogether.\n\n       Eligible organizations may, in line with the regulations currently in force,\n\navail themselves of the accommodation in one of two ways. 9 The first option is to\n\nsend a “self-certification” form, Employee Benefits Security Administration Form\n\n700 (“Form 700”), to the eligible organization’s insurer, if the organization has an\n\ninsured plan, or to the organization’s third-party administrator, if the organization\n\nhas a self-insured plan. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b)(3), (c)(1). Form 700 requires\n\neligible organizations to identify themselves as qualifying for the accommodation;\n\nlist the name, title, and contact information of the person authorized to make that\n\ncertification; and sign and date the form. 10 The second option is to send to the\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services less-formal notice of the eligible\n\norganization’s intent to opt out. That notice must include “the name of the eligible\n\norganization and the basis on which it qualifies for an accommodation,” notice of\n\n       8\n          For example, Eternal Word Television Network has a self-insured health plan for which\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as third-party administrator. The Dioceses\ncollectively maintain three self-insured health plans, for all of which Meritain Health serves as\nthird-party administrator. Though Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama and Meritain Health may\nseparately offer insured plans, they are not responsible for paying the claims of Eternal Word\nTelevision Network’s and the Dioceses’ beneficiaries.\n        9\n          In the pre–Wheaton College iteration of the contraceptive mandate, there was only one\nway to opt out under the accommodation: submitting Employee Benefits Security\nAdministration Form 700 to the relevant insurer or third-party administrator. See infra n.11.\n        10\n           A copy of Form 700 is appended to the majority’s opinion.\n\n                                              101\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 102 of 148\n\n\nits objection to the contraceptive mandate “based on [the eligible organization’s]\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs,” the name and type of the eligible organization’s\n\nhealth plan, and the identity and contact information of the eligible organization’s\n\ninsurer or third-party administrator. Id. § 147.131(c)(1)(ii).\n\n      Under the first option provided for in the accommodation, whereby Form\n\n700 is sent directly to an eligible organization’s insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator, the recipient insurer or third-party administrator becomes\n\nresponsible for establishing separate contraceptive coverage for the eligible\n\norganization’s female employees and plan beneficiaries. The insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator must, upon receipt of the eligible organization’s Form 700,\n\n“[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage” from the eligible organization’s plan\n\nand “[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be\n\ncovered” pursuant to the contraceptive mandate. Id. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A)–(B).\n\nAmong other requirements, the insurer or third-party administrator must also\n\n“segregate premium revenue … from the monies used to provide payments for\n\ncontraceptive services” and is forbidden from “impos[ing] any cost-sharing\n\nrequirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impos[ing]\n\nany premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on\n\nthe eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or\n\nbeneficiaries.” Id. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). And the insurer or third-party administrator\n\n                                          102\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 103 of 148\n\n\nmust provide to plan members and beneficiaries written notice outlining how the\n\naccommodation works and “specify[ing] that the eligible organization does not\n\nadminister or fund contraceptive benefits.” See id. § 147.131(d) (proposing\n\nsuggested language for this notice).\n\n       Under the second option provided for in the accommodation, whereby less-\n\nformal notice is sent instead to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the\n\nSecretary is then tasked with alerting the eligible organization’s insurer or third-\n\nparty administrator. The Department of Health and Human Services will “send a\n\nseparate notification” to the insurer relaying that the eligible organization’s notice\n\nwas received and “describing the [insurer’s or third-party administrator’s]\n\nobligations.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1)(ii). The insurer’s or third-party\n\nadministrator’s obligations to provide separate coverage pursuant to the\n\ncontraceptive mandate are identical whether it is alerted to the eligible\n\norganization’s objections directly by Form 700 or indirectly by the Government. 11\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          The reason that eligible organizations are given two similar-seeming options for opting\nout of the contraceptive mandate stems from the Supreme Court’s decision in Wheaton College\nv. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">__, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). In Wheaton College, the\nSupreme Court enjoined enforcement of the contraceptive mandate against an eligible\norganization that sent written notice to the Government but objected, based on the organization’s\nreligious beliefs, to sending Form 700 to its insurer and third-party administrator. Id. at __, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2807</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The Court did not address the situation presented here where an eligible\norganization objects, on religious grounds, both to completing Form 700 and to providing less-\nformal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n                                               103\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 104 of 148\n\n\n       The regulations require eligible organizations to affirmatively opt out of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate because doing so enables the Government to require the\n\neligible organizations’ insurers and third-party administrators to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. For eligible organizations with insured plans,12 opting out\n\nunder the accommodation notifies the insurers of their obligations to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i). For eligible organizations\n\nwith self-insured plans that contract with a third-party administrator,13 opting out\n\nof the contraceptive mandate under the accommodation makes the third-party\n\nadministrator “the plan administrator” for purposes of the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq., under regulations\n\npromulgated by the Department of Labor. 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). If the\n\neligible organization submits Form 700, that submission “shall be treated as a\n\ndesignation of the third party administrator as the plan administrator.” Id. If the\n\neligible organization instead provides less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health\n\nand Human Services, “the Department of Labor, working with the Department of\n\nHealth and Human Services, shall … provide notification … that such third party\n\nadministrator shall be the plan administrator” under ERISA. Id. Once a third-\n\nparty administrator becomes a “plan administrator” under ERISA, the relevant\n       12\n           Because this case does not involve eligible organizations with insured plans, I pass no\njudgment on the accommodation in that context.\n        13\n           As mentioned above, eligible organizations that administer their own self-insured plans\nare not subject to the contraceptive mandate under the regulations.\n\n                                               104\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 105 of 148\n\n\nadministrative agencies gain the regulatory authority to require the third-party\n\nadministrator to provide contraceptive coverage.14 Id. § 2510.3-16(c).\n\n       The Government’s regulatory authority to require third-party administrators\n\nof self-insured plans to provide contraceptive coverage is limited. A third-party\n\nadministrator may always decline to “agree[] to enter into or remain in a\n\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization.”15 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n2713A(b)(2). Only if it accepts the terms of the regulations does a third-party\n\nadministrator incur the obligation “to provide or arrange payments for\n\ncontraceptive services.” Id. § 54.9815-2713A(d). If a third-party administrator\n\nagrees to provide the contraceptive coverage, the costs it incurs to do so will be\n\nreimbursed from “Federally-facilitated Exchange” user fees, which are fees\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           Under ERISA, a third-party administrator that is neither the “plan sponsor” nor\nspecifically designated as such can be considered the “plan administrator” only “as the Secretary\n[of Labor] may by regulation prescribe.” 29 U.S.C. § 1002(16)(A)(iii). The Government\ncontends that, as currently written, the ACA’s implementing regulations also allow it to\nindependently enforce the contraceptive mandate against third-party administrators of self-\ninsured plans without any further action from the eligible organization. The truth of this\ncontention is far from certain. See ante at 44–45 & nn.30–31; Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Health and Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 n.8 (8th Cir. 2015) (collecting cases\ncontrary to the Government’s position). In any event, I decline to pass judgment on this question\nbecause its resolution is unnecessary to decide this case.\n        15\n           If a third-party administrator declines to provide contraceptive coverage, eligible\norganizations with self-insured plans must select another willing third-party administrator,\nadminister its own health plan, or become subject to the monetary penalties discussed above.\n\n                                              105\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 106 of 148\n\n\nimposed on insurers offering health plans on exchanges established by the\n\nGovernment under the ACA. 16 See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n                                               B.\n\n       Inextricably intertwined with these evolving regulations is a series of cases\n\nchallenging the various iterations of the contraceptive mandate under the Religious\n\nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. RFRA provides\n\nthat the federal government 17 “may substantially burden a person’s exercise of\n\nreligion” only if it does so “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest”\n\nand the burden it imposes is “the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.” Id. § 2000bb-1(b).\n\n       In 1993, Congress enacted RFRA in response to the Supreme Court’s path-\n\nbreaking approach to the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause taken in\n\nEmployment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494\n\n\n       16\n           Specifically, the regulations contemplate “adjustments” to the third-party\nadministrator’s own user fees, if the third-party administrator also offers health plans on a\nFederally-facilitated Exchange, or the user fees of another participating insurer that the third-\nparty administrator contracts with to receive reimbursement. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328. Third-\nparty administrators are to be reimbursed for the “total dollar amount of the payments for\ncontraceptive services” and an “allowance for administrative costs and margin” of “no less than\n10 percent” for the amount spent on contraceptive services. 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d)(3)(i), (ii).\nThe Government does not address how reimbursement will be made, if at all, should these user\nfees prove insufficient.

Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2785. The Court began by\n\ndetermining that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, RFRA covers certain for-\n\nprofit companies because the term “person” was not limited only to natural\n\npersons. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2767–75. Moving to RFRA’s threshold inquiry,\n\nthe Court “ha[d] little trouble concluding” that the contraceptive mandate imposes\n\na substantial burden on religious exercise. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2775. The\n\nHobby Lobby plaintiffs had an uncontested “sincere religious belief that life begins\n\nat conception” and understood that their belief would be violated if they were\n\nrequired to “provid[e] health insurance that covers methods of birth control” that\n\n“may result in the destruction of an embryo.” Id. By forcing them to choose\n\nbetween violating their deeply held convictions and “pay[ing] an enormous sum of\n\nmoney,” the contraceptive mandate “clearly imposes a substantial burden on those\n\nbeliefs.” Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779.\n\ncase involves only employers with religious objections and is resolved by RFRA’s clear dictates,\nI decline to address the constitutional propriety of applying the contraceptive mandate to non-\nreligious objectors.\n        19\n           Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby, joined by Chief Justice\nRoberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas. Justice Kennedy concurred. Justice Ginsburg\ndissented, joined in full by Justice Sotomayor and in relevant part by Justices Breyer and Kagan.\n\n                                              108\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 109 of 148\n\n\n      The Court specifically and emphatically rejected any argument that the\n\nparticipation of religious objectors, by paying for contraceptive coverage, is\n\n“simply too attenuated” from the objectionable outcome, the destruction of\n\nembryos, to constitute a burden on religious exercise. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2777.\n\nSuch an argument, which “implicates a difficult and important question of religion\n\nand moral philosophy,” would “in effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are\n\nflawed”—and defining the scope of religious belief is a dangerous line-drawing\n\ninquiry “federal courts have no business addressing.” See id. at __, 134 S.

Moreover, the Court noted, if the contraceptive mandate’s burden were\n\nnot substantial, it would “be hard to understand” and “not easy to square” with the\n\nexemptions carved out for qualifying “religious employers” facing “exactly the\n\nsame” burden. Id. at __ n.33, 134 S. Ct. at 2777 n.33.\n\n      The Court next declined to address whether the contraceptive mandate\n\nfurthered a compelling interest because, even if it did, the contraceptive mandate\n\nwas not the least restrictive means of doing so. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779–80.\n\nThe Court identified several less-restrictive alternatives that the Government could\n\nhave used to achieve the assumed compelling interest, holding that the\n\n                                          109\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 110 of 148\n\n\ncontraceptive mandate foundered under RFRA’s “exceptionally demanding”\n\nstandard. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. The “most straightforward” alternative\n\n“would be for the Government to assume the cost” of contraceptive coverage. Id.\n\nat __, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. In response to the Government’s contrary position, the\n\nCourt observed that “it is hard to understand [the] argument that [the Government]\n\ncannot be required under RFRA to pay anything” for “a Government interest of the\n\nhighest order.” Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781. 20 The Court also strongly suggested\n\nthat the Government’s direct provision of contraceptive coverage would still be a\n\nless-restrictive alternative if the Government were required to create “an entirely\n\nnew program” rather than “modif[y] an existing program (which RFRA surely\n\nallows).” Id.\n\n\n       In its analysis the Court decided it “need not rely on the option of a new,\n\ngovernment-funded program” to identify a less-restrictive alternative because the\n\nregulations already provided one: the then-existing version of the accommodation\n\nfor employers with religious objections. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781–82. The for-\n       20\n           Requiring the Government to, at times, spend additional monies to avoid imposing\nsubstantial burdens on the free exercise of religious objectors would accord with RFRA’s sister\nstatute, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 2000cc, 2000cc-1. See id. § 2000cc-3(c) (“[T]his chapter may require a government to incur\nexpenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.”).\nCongress enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending and Commerce Clauses after the Supreme\nCourt in City of Boerne held that RFRA could not be applied to the actions of state governments\nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See supra note 17. The standard of RLUIPA mirrors\nthat of RFRA and applies in two contexts: land-use regulation and the religious exercise of\ninstitutionalized persons.\n\n                                              110\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 111 of 148\n\n\nprofit Hobby Lobby plaintiffs did not object to the accommodation itself, so\n\ngranting them the option for a third party to provide their female employees’\n\ncontraceptive coverage “serves [the Government’s] stated interests equally well.”\n\nId. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781–82. Though derided as “‘noncommittal’” by the\n\ndissent for doing so, the Court expressly declined to rule on “whether an approach\n\nof this type complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.” Id. at __ &\n\nn.40, 134 S. Ct. at 2782 & n.40.\n\n       Three days after it decided Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court again ruled on\n\nthe contraceptive mandate in Wheaton College v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">__, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014).21 In Wheaton College, the Court issued an order\n\nenjoining the Secretary of Health and Human Services, “pending final disposition\n\nof appellate review,” from enforcing the contraceptive mandate against an\n\nemployer that submits “in writing that it is a non-profit organization that holds\n\nitself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for\n\ncontraceptive services.” Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The parties disputed whether\n\nthe obligation to provide contraceptive coverage was “dependent” on submitting\n\nForm 700 to an insurer or third-party administrator. Id. The Court concluded in its\n\ntwo-page order that, because notice had already been given to the Government, the\n\n       21\n         Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Thomas, Kennedy, and Breyer joined the\nCourt’s decision in Wheaton College. Justice Scalia concurred without issuing a separate\nopinion. Justice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Kagan.\n\n                                             111\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 112 of 148\n\n\nGovernment “relying on this notice” could “facilitate the provision of full\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the [ACA].” Id. The Court ended its order by noting\n\nthat it “should not be construed as an expression of the Court’s views on the\n\nmerits.” Id.\n\n       After Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College, the federal courts were inundated\n\nwith cases posing the question presented here: whether RFRA provides relief to\n\nemployers with religious objections to the accommodation itself. Our sister\n\ncircuits are deeply divided. Like the majority, most circuits have concluded that,\n\nthough RFRA requires deference to adherents’ sincerely held religious beliefs, “an\n\nobjective inquiry” to determine whether a law presents a substantial burden reveals\n\nthat the accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on religious\n\nexercise. 22 Ante at 33–41; see also Catholic Health Care Sys. v.

The agencies ultimately determined that the Government had a compelling\n\ninterest in providing women with cost-free access to a wide range of contraceptive\n\nservices. In accordance with that determination, the agencies, through threat of\n\nlarge monetary penalties, mandated that certain employers must provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage to their female employees. Though Congress had already\n\nexempted some types of employers—those with fewer than fifty employees and\n\nthose with grandfathered health plans—the agencies decided that another group of\n\n\n\n\n                                        114\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 115 of 148\n\n\nemployers should be exempt too: churches and church-affiliated organizations, as\n\ndefined by already-existing definitions in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n      The agencies exempted churches and church-affiliated organizations from\n\nthe contraceptive mandate because the agencies understood that the contraceptive\n\nmandate would impose a substantial burden on many of these organizations’\n\nreligious exercise. As a result, churches and church-affiliated organizations may\n\nchoose what contraceptive coverage, if any, will be available in their female\n\nemployees’ health plans. No such exemption, however, was thought necessary for\n\nother organizations with similar religious objections, whether for-profit or\n\nnonprofit. After much public outcry and litigation, the agencies changed course.\n\nAt first, the agencies began offering an exemption-like option to certain nonprofits\n\nwith religious objections. In response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Hobby\n\nLobby, the agencies extended the same to for-profit religious objectors as well.\n\n\n      But the exemption-like option—the accommodation—did not truly exempt\n\nqualifying employers. Rather, it required qualifying employers to affirmatively opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage, shifting the obligation to provide the\n\nrequired contraceptive coverage to the employers’ insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator. Originally, qualifying employers had to opt out by sending Form\n\n700 to the insurer or third-party administrator responsible for the employers’ health\n\nplans, alerting the insurer or third-party administrator to its new obligations. After\n\n                                         115\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 116 of 148\n\n\nthe Supreme Court’s order in Wheaton College, the agencies also made available\n\nan option of providing less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices. Under this option, the notice is rerouted to the insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator, in lieu of the employer submitting Form 700 directly.\n\n      For employers that run self-insured health plans in conjunction with a third-\n\nparty administrator and are eligible for the accommodation, opting out of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate has the effect of designating the employers’ third-party\n\nadministrators as “plan administrators” under ERISA. Once so designated, the\n\nagencies can require a third-party administrator to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\nAbsent any affirmative action from the employer, third-party administrators remain\n\noutside of ERISA’s reach. Likewise outside of ERISA’s reach, and thus\n\neffectively exempt from the contraceptive mandate, are employers that run self-\n\ninsured health plans without a third-party administrator.\n\n      As a result, there are four discrete options facing employers like Eternal\n\nWord Television Network and the Dioceses, which operate self-insured plans and\n\ndo not meet the Internal Revenue Code’s definition for churches or church-\n\naffiliated organizations but nonetheless have religious objections to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. First, these employers can provide the objectionable\n\ncoverage in violation of their beliefs. Second, these employers can comply with\n\nthe accommodation and affirmatively opt out of the contraceptive mandate,\n\n                                          116\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 117 of 148\n\n\nshifting the obligation to provide the required coverage to their insurer or third-\n\nparty administrator, also in violation of their beliefs. Third, these employers can\n\ndrop their third-party administrators and assume the costs and responsibilities of\n\nrunning their own health plans. Fourth, these employers can do nothing and\n\nthereby become liable for annual fines of thousands of dollars per employee.\n\n      This case requires two determinations. First, does the regulatory scheme\n\ndiscussed above impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of Eternal\n\nWord Television Network and the Dioceses, which believe that opting out under\n\nthe accommodation would violate the sanctity of human life? If so, does the\n\nregulatory scheme nonetheless survive RFRA’s demanding standard of strict\n\nscrutiny? Because I conclude that the answers to these questions are yes and no,\n\nwhile the majority says no and yes, I dissent.\n\n                                         II.\n\n       The threshold inquiry under RFRA requires a showing that the Government\n\nhas “substantially burden[ed]” the plaintiff’s “exercise of religion.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000bb-1. First, a RFRA plaintiff must identify religious exercise that the\n\nGovernment is burdening.

Second, the majority mischaracterizes how the contraceptive\n\nmandate works by understating the critical role that the accommodation forces\n\nemployers to play in providing contraceptive coverage.\n\n      Before explaining why the majority fails to give RFRA its proper meaning,\n\nit is helpful to clarify how our understandings of RFRA’s inquiry differ.

Though the majority purports to defer to these beliefs, its\n\ndeference is largely illusory. The majority begins by correctly observing that\n\n                                             122\n\f            Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 123 of 148\n\n\nRFRA’s substantial-burden inquiry “involves both subjective and objective\n\ndimensions.” Ante at 34. The majority continues on, also correctly, to observe that\n\n“courts must accept a religious adherent’s assertion that his religious beliefs\n\nrequire him to take or abstain from taking a specified action.” Id. The majority\n\nfalters, however, when it concludes that “it is for the courts to determine\n\nobjectively . . . whether the government has, in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of\n\nviolating their religious beliefs . . . or incurring a substantial penalty.” Id. at 36–\n\n37.\n\n      Contrary to the majority’s position, RFRA does require deference to\n\nreligious adherents’ determinations that their sincerely held beliefs are being\n\nburdened. “The narrow function of a reviewing court in this context” prevents\n\nunnecessary and improper judicial intrusion into highly sensitive matters of moral\n\nphilosophy or theology, Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716, 101 S. Ct. at 1431, and this\n\nunderstanding of the substantial-burden standard is confirmed by the Supreme\n\nCourt’s most recent religious-accommodation decisions.

For example, courts must defer to a religious adherent’s belief, if it is\n\nsincerely held, that dancing is morally wrong.25 And courts must defer to the\n\nreligious adherent’s understanding that this belief would be burdened if she were\n\nrequired to look upon, even if only for a moment, a single masquerade ball or sock\n\nhop. What courts must determine as an objective matter is whether the burden\n\nimposed by any pro-dancing Government action is a substantial one. Imposing\n\nmillions of dollars in fines for failing to perform a Government-mandated jitterbug\n\nwould, obviously, be a substantial burden on religious exercise. In contrast, there\n\nwould be no substantial burden if the Government merely financed public\n\ndancefloors or had a hortatory policy of extolling the virtues of dance.26\n\n       If the substantial-burden test were as the majority believes it to be, federal\n\njudges would have to decide whether the burden itself substantially violated the\n\nadherent’s beliefs. That is, the majority would necessarily shift the gaze of its\n\n“objective inquiry” to the merits of religious belief.

But, of\n\ncourse, the Constitution does not vest in the judiciary the authority to declare\n\nwinners and losers in matters of faith. And for good reason.\n\n      At bottom, the majority’s reasoning takes aim at the heart of RFRA itself.\n\nImplicit in the majority’s rationale is the notion that wily plaintiffs could game the\n\nsystem if religious adherents’ beliefs were given the full extent of the deference\n\ndemanded by RFRA. In tailoring their stated beliefs, these plaintiffs could engage\n\nin strategic litigation unhampered, impairing the government’s ability to function\n\nefficiently.

Here, despite conceding as the\n\nmajority must that “the act of opting out plays [some] causal role in the ultimate\n\nprovision of contraceptive coverage,” the majority runs roughshod over the\n\nsincerely held religious objections of Eternal Word Television Network and the\n\nDioceses because, in line with the majority’s sense of things, the “de minimis\n\nburden that the plaintiffs face” resulting from their role as “an incidental cause of\n\ncontraceptive coverage being provided” does not constitute a substantial burden.\n\nId. at 44-45, 47. The majority through a nifty bit of legalistic legerdemain\n\nmanages to transform the subjective content of religious adherents’ sincerely held\n\nbeliefs into an objective question of federal law, undercutting the very deference to\n\nreligious exercise it purports to extend.\n\n      The majority’s not-so-veiled implication that, if given its full effect, RFRA\n\nwill be refashioned from a shield protecting the faithful into a sword wielded by\n\ncynical opportunists is troubling and at odds with RFRA’s fundamental respect for\n\nthe deeply held convictions that guide the daily lives of hundreds of millions of\n\nAmericans. As an initial matter, whether or not a belief is sincerely held remains\n\nan important part of RFRA’s substantial-burden inquiry. Courts are not, for\n\nexample, compelled to entertain challenges from such obvious farces as a\n\n\n\n\n                                            126\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 127 of 148\n\n\nhypothetical “Church of Marijuana and Pepperoni Pizza”27 or the satirical “Our\n\nLady of Perpetual Exemption.” 28 Separating the faithful sheep from the cynically\n\nopportunistic goats is well within our judicial capabilities.\n\n       Moreover, to the extent that granting exemptions for religious adherents\n\nwould impair the government’s ability to run programs and administer law\n\nefficiently, this is a feature of RFRA, not a bug. Congress made the clear policy\n\nchoice that protecting the individual right of free religious exercise outweighed the\n\ncosts imposed at the expense of administrative efficiency. And this choice—to\n\npreserve individual freedom by fettering the Government’s ability to act as\n\nexpeditiously as possible—is at the core of our foundational notion of limited\n\ngovernment. Permitting demonstrations in public parks, requiring police officers\n\nto secure a warrant before searching homes or seizing persons, and committing the\n\nGovernment to provide just compensation if it wishes to take private property all\n\nsurely hamper the Government’s ability to pursue countless other important ends.\n\nThese tradeoffs are the cost of liberty.

Moreover, if “compelling interests” really means what it\n      says (and watering it down here would subvert its rigor in the other\n      fields where it is applied), many laws will not meet the test. Any\n      society adopting such a system would be courting anarchy, but that\n      danger increases in direct proportion to the society’s diversity of\n      religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or suppress none of\n      them.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 888, 110 S.

The majority believes that the accommodation places no\n\nburden on the beliefs of Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses\n\nbecause the “significance they attribute to this act [of opting out]” is misguided,\n\nand thus the outcome of this case is not controlled by the otherwise-identical\n\nanalysis in Hobby Lobby.

This is so even though\n\nthe majority “acknowledge[s] that an eligible organization’s act of [opting out]\n\nresults in the TPA’s designation as the plan administrator” under ERISA and “may\n\nbe an incidental cause of contraceptive coverage being provided.” Id. at 44–45.\n\nBoiled down to its bare essentials, the majority’s position is that if the parties really\n\nunderstood what is going on, they would have no basis to object to their role in the\n\ncontraceptive mandate’s regulatory scheme.\n\n       It is the majority, however, that misunderstands the contraceptive mandate.\n\nUnder its regulatory scheme, as bounded by the statutory requirements of the ACA\n\nand ERISA, 30 the Government becomes empowered to require contraceptive\n\ncoverage for an eligible organization’s self-insured health plan only if that\n\norganization affirmatively opts out under the accommodation.

The majority is\n\nincorrect, then, to say that the contraceptive mandate “does not turn on whether\n\n[an] eligible organization employer chooses to comply with the law.” See ante at\n\n44. Federal law kicks in only after an eligible organization acts; should an eligible\n\norganization decline to do anything, the Government lacks an independent means\n\nto ensure the provision of contraceptive coverage. Because the regulations\n\ncondition the provision of contraceptive coverage on eligible organizations’\n\naffirmative participation, their participation is the linchpin on which the\n\ncontraceptive mandate rests.\n\n       To draw an analogy with which any first-year law student should be well\n\nacquainted, an eligible organization’s opting out under the accommodation is both\n\nan actual and proximate cause of the provision of contraceptive coverage. There\n\ncan be no doubt that opting out under the accommodation is a “cause in fact” of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage. But for opting out, the Government would lack\n\nthe requisite regulatory authority over the third-party administrators of the\n\norganizations’ health plans. Cf. Stacy v.

According to the majority, because federal law\n\nentails the authorization to require third-party administrators to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage, opting out is only “an incidental cause of contraceptive\n\ncoverage being provided.” See ante at 44–45.\n\n      I fail to see, however, how affirmatively opting out of the contraceptive\n\nmandate under the accommodation could be deemed anything other than a\n\n“substantial factor” or “material concurring cause” directly leading to the provision\n\nof religiously objectionable coverage.

As Judge Manion puts it in\nhis thorough debunking of this familiar trope,\n         This is not like the case of a conscientious objector who objects and the\n         government finds a replacement. Under the regulations, the government does not\n         find the replacement, the nonprofit does. The designation does not take place\n         unless the nonprofit either delivers the self-certification form to its insurer or\n         TPA, or uses the alternative notice to inform the government who its insurer or\n         TPA is and which health plan is at issue. By insisting that the nonprofit deliver\n         the form or supply the plan information for the government's use, the government\n         uses the objecting nonprofit to do its dirty work. The government has not\n         provided an exit—it offers a revolving door with only one opening.\n         ...\n         This is not the case of a conscientious objector walking into the draft board,\n         voicing his objection, being excused, and walking out. For the analogy to fit the\n         HHS accommodation, the draft board must decide that every objector will be\n         replaced by the objector’s friend, and the objector’s objection is only effective if\n         the objector delivers written notice of his objection to his friend or tells the draft\n         board who his friend is and where the board can find him. Then, the objector\n         must send his friend money so that his friend will remain his friend for the\n         purpose of being his replacement.\nGrace Sch. v.

Of\n\ncourse there is. As the Hobby Lobby majority observed: “The most\n\nstraightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost\n\nof providing” the objectionable contraceptive coverage. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at __, 134 S. Ct.\n\nat 2780. Though the Court did not ultimately need to reach the question of\n\nwhether direct Government provision of contraceptive coverage would constitute a\n\nless-restrictive alternative because the plaintiffs did not object to the\n\naccommodation, id. at __, 1354 S. Ct. at 2780–82, we must do so here. And I fail\n\n                                          138\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 139 of 148\n\n\nto see any reason why the Court’s persuasive reasoning should not be adopted.\n\nThe Government has not shown, as it must, that it would be able to provide the\n\nsame access to contraceptive coverage to the same women only if it can force\n\neligible organizations to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\n       Speaking bluntly, RFRA makes the Government put its money where its\n\nmouth is. I see nothing in RFRA’s text or the subsequent case law that would\n\nallow the Government to claim a compelling interest without having to spend a\n\nsingle red cent to do anything about it. Significant here, the Government must\n\nnecessarily agree that RFRA compels it to fund contraceptive coverage otherwise\n\nthe accommodation would not exist at all. Indeed, the entire purpose of the\n\naccommodation is to make the provision of contraceptive coverage independent of\n\nthe eligible organization, including segregating all the costs paid by the eligible\n\norganization from all the expenditures for the objectionable services. Aware of the\n\nfallacy of free-lunch thinking and absent any expectation of third-party\n\nadministrators acting out of purely eleemosynary impulse, the Government\n\ncommitted itself to funding contraceptive coverage for certain religious objectors,35\n\nalbeit in roundabout fashion.\n\n\n\n       35\n          Notably, the Government did not similarly commit itself to fund contraceptive\ncoverage for female employees of other employers with religious objections—either churches\nand church-affiliated organizations or eligible organizations that maintain self-insured health\nplans but do not use a third-party administrator. Nor did the Government commit itself to fund\n\n                                              139\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 140 of 148\n\n\n       To be clear, the Government is already committed to fund the contraceptive\n\nmandate under the current regulations. The Government reimburses third-party\n\nadministrators required to fund contraceptive coverage through a reduction in\n\nFederally-facilitated Exchange user fees, the amount of money paid to be able to\n\noffer insurance products on exchanges established by the Government under the\n\nACA. 36 Money is fungible; the Government finds itself in the same financial\n\nposition whether it declines to collect a tax liability of $500 or whether it collects\n\nthe $500 and then immediately refunds the same. By forgoing revenue to fund the\n\ncontraceptive coverage for the female employees of eligible organizations that opt\n\nout under the accommodation, the Government is effectively paying for the\n\nobjectionable coverage. And in contrast to the half-measure of the\n\naccommodation—which covers only a limited set of religiously objecting\n\nemployers and does not provide access to the female employees of churches and\n\nchurch-affiliated organizations, employers with grandfathered health plans, or\n\ncontraceptive coverage for female employees of employers with grandfathered plans or\nemployers with fewer than fifty full-time employees.\n         Though there may be some level of backstop coverage provided by the other provisions\nof the ACA and Title X, see infra n.36, the Government’s failure to extend its largesse to these\nwomen may also call into question the contraceptive mandate’s asserted compelling interest—\nwhich, again, I assume the Government would be able to show—but certainly raises an obvious\nquestion: If the Government is able and willing to pay for some women to receive access to\ncontraceptive coverage, why would it not be a less-restrictive means to do so in a more\nstraightforward manner for all women at risk of being denied such access?\n         36\n            As discussed above, third-party administrators may either reduce their own Federally-\nfacilitated Exchange user fees if they are also in the business of selling insurance or they may\nenter into a contractual arrangement with another insurer to recoup that insurer’s user fees. See\n80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n                                               140\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 141 of 148\n\n\nemployers with fewer than fifty full-time employees 37—providing for\n\ncontraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation’s administrative\n\nrigmarole would allow the Government to offer cost-free access to each and every\n\nwoman in the United States should it choose to do so. And the Government has\n\nfailed to shoulder its burden to show that it would be unable to grant women access\n\nto contraceptive coverage without the coerced involvement of Eternal Word\n\nTelevision Network and the Dioceses.\n\n       Again, this straightforward application of well-established legal principles\n\nshould carry the day. But, again, the majority thinks otherwise. Specifically, the\n\nmajority concludes that the current iteration of the contraceptive mandate has\n\nfinally hit upon the least restrictive means of achieving the Government’s\n\ncompelling interest when “the cost to the government” and “the burden the\n\nalternatives impose on the affected women” are taken into account. See ante at 63.\n\nThough I do not dispute that these concerns are relevant to the least-restrictive-\n\n\n\n\n       37\n          For female employees whose health plans are not subject to the contraceptive mandate,\nthe Government has stitched together a patchwork safety net under Title X and other provisions\nof the ACA. The record does not reveal how many women who would otherwise lack access to\ncontraceptive services are eligible for coverage under this makeshift framework. Nor does the\nrecord reveal whether there are hundreds, thousands, or millions of women who will continue to\ngo without such access, with or without the accommodation. Though a less-restrictive means\nneed not be a perfect means, strict scrutiny demands that the Government’s chosen solution must\nbe “neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive.” Brown v.

According to the majority, if the Government were forced to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage “outside the existing, largely employer-based,\n\ninsurance system,” whether directly or through tax credits, “Congress would need\n\nto pass legislation that would fundamentally change how the majority of\n\nAmericans receive” contraceptive coverage specifically, if not healthcare\n\ngenerally. See id. at 66–67. Likewise, if forced to keep the current model of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage through eligible organizations’ health plans, “the\n\ngovernment would be hamstrung” because of the “gaps” in institutional knowledge\n\nthat would spring up regarding which female employees of which employers\n\nwould be covered by the Government and which are not. Id. at 72. As a result,\n\nbecause the majority believes that adopting any of the alternatives it considers\n\nwould incur various administrative and transactions costs, the result would be less\n\naccess to contraceptive coverage, undermining the Government’s asserted\n\ncompelling interest. See id. at 70–71, 74.\n\n\n\n\n                                         142\n\f            Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 143 of 148\n\n\n      The majority’s insistence on assuming a virtually immutable regulatory and\n\nstatutory status quo is fundamentally misplaced. RFRA makes clear that it is the\n\n“Government” that “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion,”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a) (emphasis added), not just constituent parts acting within\n\ntheir respective spheres of authority. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente\n\nUniao do Vegetal, for example, the Supreme Court specifically rejected the\n\nGovernment’s position “that the Controlled Substances Act is [not] amenable to\n\njudicially crafted exceptions [for the hallucinogen hoasca]” because of “the\n\nexistence of a congressional exemption for peyote.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145684\"><a href=\"/opinion/145684/gonzales-v-o-centro-espirita-beneficente-uniao-do-vegetal/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145684\"><a href=\"/opinion/145684/gonzales-v-o-centro-espirita-beneficente-uniao-do-vegetal/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It would be absurd to say, then, that we\n\ncannot grant a judicially crafted exception here because the relevant administrative\n\nagencies lacked the regulatory authority to promulgate exceptions that would have\n\nbeen equally effective in achieving an allegedly compelling interest had there been\n\ncongressional action allowing them to do so. In short, if the Government as a\n\nwhole has a less-restrictive alternative available, the Government must use it.\n\n      The majority’s radically revisionist account of RFRA, in contrast, would\n\nlimit the universe of less-restrictive means to what the Executive Branch can\n\naccomplish unilaterally by administrative fiat. This is a shocking reversal of our\n\nConstitution’s prime directive: “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be\n\nvested in a Congress of the United States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. To the extent\n\n                                         143\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 144 of 148\n\n\nthat the Government claims an interest of the highest order, it is only reasonable\n\nthat Congress be expected to pitch in when freewheeling regulators encounter\n\nstatutory roadblocks. The practical hurdles to providing the access to\n\ncontraceptive coverage the Government seeks would simply disappear if Congress\n\nwere to slightly tweak the contraceptive mandate’s statutory authorization under\n\nERISA and the ACA. By having Congress eliminate the need for eligible\n\norganizations to affirmatively designate the third-party administrators of their\n\nhealth plans—thus becoming directly involved in the provision of the\n\nobjectionable coverage—the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and\n\nHuman Services would no longer need to substantially burden eligible\n\norganizations by putting them to the “choice” of affirmatively violating their\n\nsincerely held beliefs or paying massive penalties. And the Government has failed\n\nto show why this could be accomplished without imposing any additional burden\n\non female employees only if eligible organizations were required to use the\n\naccommodation. 38\n\n\n\n\n       38\n           To the extent that there may be additional administrative costs incurred in crafting an\nappropriately tailored exception to the contraceptive mandate, RFRA contemplates such costs\nand places them squarely on the Government’s shoulders. Even if the Government were to\nrequire female employees of exempt employers to fill out the sort of all-too-familiar paperwork\nassociated with receiving health insurance, such a “burden”—in contrast to being forced to either\nviolate a sincere religious conviction or face steep monetary penalties—would be, at most, “de\nminimis.” Cf.

I agree that granting an\n\nexemption that would impose costs on third parties could, under certain\n\ncircumstances, run afoul of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

Lest RFRA\n\nis understood to have ushered in the apotheosis of the administrative state, surely\n\nthe rigorous standard of strict scrutiny cannot be so easily evaded.\n\n\n      Without a doubt, there are sundry ways for the Government to provide\n\nwomen with cost-free access to contraceptive coverage. The administrative\n\nagencies tasked with promulgating the regulatory structure that undergirds the\n\ncontraceptive mandate chose, because of convenience and their bounded statutory\n\nauthority, to do so in a manner that substantially burdens religious adherents. We\n\nhave been presented insufficient evidence to hold that the goal of increasing access\n\nto contraceptive coverage could be reached only through the circuitous regulatory\n\npathways that have been cobbled together here. The Government, therefore, has\n\n                                          146\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 147 of 148\n\n\nfailed to carry its burden to show that the contraceptive mandate is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering any assumed compelling interest.\n\n                                                V.\n\n      The sweeping protections for religious exercise Congress contemplated\n\nwhen it enacted RFRA should not be denied to Eternal Word Television Network\n\nand the Dioceses. RFRA’s text and purpose, as confirmed by well-established\n\nprecedent, extend these protections to religious adherents forced to choose between\n\naffirmatively participating in a regulatory scheme that they sincerely believe would\n\nmake them complicit in denigrating the sanctity of human life and paying millions\n\nof dollars in noncompliance penalties. Because the Government cannot show that\n\nthe latest iteration of its constantly evolving “accommodation” survives strict\n\nscrutiny, RFRA bars enforcing the contraceptive mandate against those employers\n\nwhose religious exercise it substantially burdens.\n\n      By concluding otherwise, the majority diminishes the full range of religious\n\nliberty that Congress sought to protect when it enacted RFRA. Recasting and\n\nenfeebling RFRA’s standard as nothing more than “good enough for government\n\nwork” is a far cry from strict scrutiny’s typical charge of fiat justitia ruat caelum. 39\n\nPerhaps the majority’s desire to bring RFRA’s statutory protections for religious\n\nliberty closer in line with the less-demanding constitutional standard represents a\n\n      39\n           Let justice be done though the heavens may fall.\n\n                                               147\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 148 of 148\n\n\nsuperior policy judgment. Perhaps not. In any event, the majority’s application of\n\n“water[ed] down” strict scrutiny is exactly the sort of wishy-washy treatment likely\n\nto “subvert its rigors in the other fields where it applies” that motivated the\n\nSupreme Court’s Smith decision in the first place.
