Chapter 6119—Sewer district has authority to\n        establish regional stormwater-management program and to charge fees to\n        implement stormwater-management program.\n(No. 2013-1770—Submitted September 9, 2014—Decided September 15, 2015.)\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, Nos. 98728 and 98729,\n                                   2013-Ohio-4186.\n                             _______________________\n        PFEIFER, J.\n        {¶ 1} Appellant, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (the “Sewer\nDistrict”), seeks to implement a regional stormwater-management program.\nAppellees, political subdivisions and landowners within the Sewer District, argue\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nand the court of appeals concluded that the Sewer District is not authorized to\nestablish a stormwater-management program.          We disagree and reverse the\njudgment of the court of appeals.\n                                    BACKGROUND\n       {¶ 2} The Sewer District, a political subdivision of the state of Ohio, was\nformed in 1972 and includes as member communities all or parts of over 60 cities,\nvillages, and townships in and around Cuyahoga County. In January 2010, the\nSewer District adopted a plan to establish a regional stormwater-management\nprogram and a structure for fees to be charged to landowners within the Sewer\nDistrict whose properties contain impervious surfaces. The Sewer District then\nfiled an action in common pleas court against its member communities seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it had the authority to implement the regional\nstormwater-management program and to impose the fees. Some of those member\ncommunities and several intervening landowners argued that the Sewer District\nlacked authority to implement the program and fees under R.C. Chapter 6119 and\nthe Sewer District’s charter and that the fees were unconstitutional.\n       {¶ 3} In April 2011, the trial court declared, upon a motion for partial\nsummary judgment, that the Sewer District had authority under R.C. Chapter\n6119 and its charter to enact a regional stormwater-management program. The\ncourt of appeals reversed. It properly concluded that as a creature of statute, the\nSewer District’s authority is limited by the statutory scheme that created it. 999\nN.E.2d 181, 2013-Ohio-4186, ¶ 40. The court of appeals stated that\n\n\n       the purpose of a regional water and sewer district is for “either or\n       both” of the following purposes: “(A) [t]o supply water to users\n       within or without the district”; and “(B) [t]o provide for the\n       collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water within and\n       without the district.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n(Brackets sic.) Id. at ¶ 43, quoting R.C. 6119.01(A) and (B).\n        {¶ 4} The court of appeals concluded that although the statutory scheme\n“authorize[s] the Sewer District to collect, treat, and dispose of waste water\nentering the sewer system,” it “does not authorize the District to implement a\n‘stormwater management’ program.” Id. at ¶ 43 and 46. This conclusion depends\nin large part upon the court’s pronouncement that “[t]he term waste water\nnecessarily means water containing waste.” Id. at ¶ 44, citing Reith v. McGill\nSmith Punshon, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d 709, 2005-Ohio-4852, 840 N.E.2d 226\n(1st Dist.).\n        {¶ 5} The trial court also concluded after a bench trial that the Sewer\nDistrict is authorized by R.C. Chapter 6119 to charge fees to pay for the\nstormwater-management program. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that\nthe fees were “not for the ‘use or service’ of a ‘water resource project.’ ”\n        {¶ 6} We granted the Sewer District’s discretionary appeal as to\nProposition of Law No. I (asserting that the program and fees are authorized\nunder R.C. Chapter 6119) and Proposition of Law No. II (asserting that the\nprogram and fees are authorized under the Sewer District’s charter). 138 Ohio\nSt.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, 3 N.E.3d 1216.\n                                     ANALYSIS\n        {¶ 7} Despite the great interests at stake, the issues in this case are\nexceedingly straightforward: (1) is the Sewer District’s regional stormwater-\nmanagement program authorized by statute and by its charter and (2) is the\nattendant fee structure authorized by statute and by the charter. We answer both\nquestions in the affirmative.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nI. The regional stormwater-management program is authorized by statute and by\n                             the Sewer District’s charter\n        {¶ 8} There are many sound policy reasons to support or oppose the\ncreation of the Sewer District’s regional stormwater-management program and its\nattendant fee structure. The various party and amicus briefs are testaments to this.\nAlthough we appreciate their substantive significance, they are not germane to the\nlegal issues before us.\n        {¶ 9} The parties do not dispute that the Sewer District is a valid creature\nof statute, authorized by R.C. Chapter 6119. The Sewer District’s ability to create\na regional stormwater-management program must, then, have its basis in the\nstatutory scheme, which provides only two valid purposes for a regional water or\nsewer district. The district must “supply water,” which the sewer district does\nnot, or it must “provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water.”\nR.C. 6119.01.\n        {¶ 10} R.C. 6119.011(K) defines “waste water” as “any storm water and\nany water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or\ncontaminants derived from the prior use of the water.” Despite its plain language,\nthe parties’ interpretations of this definition are radically different.\n        {¶ 11} Appellees argue, and the court of appeals concluded, that “[t]he\nterm waste water necessarily means water containing waste.” 2013-Ohio-4186,\n999 N.E.2d 181, ¶ 44. Appellees contend that the participial phrase “containing\nsewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the\nprior use of the water” modifies the noun “any storm water” as well as the noun\n“any water,” which would mean that stormwater is only “waste water” when it is\ncombined with sewage or pollutants.\n        {¶ 12} The definition provided in the statute is uncomplicated.          See\nYoungstown Club v. Porterfield, 21 Ohio St.2d 83, 86, 255 N.E.2d 262 (1970) (“it\nis customary to give words their plain ordinary meaning unless the legislative\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nbody has clearly expressed a contrary intention”). In our view, the statute plainly\nindicates that “waste water” comes in two forms. One is “any storm water.” The\nother is “any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or\ncontaminants derived from the prior use of the water.” There is no other plausible\nreading of the definition.\n        {¶ 13} The definition sought by appellees renders the words “any storm\nwater and” meaningless. But the words “any storm water and” are in the statute,\nand it is well known that our duty is to “give effect to the words used, not to\ndelete words used or to insert words not used.” Columbus-Suburban Coach\nLines, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., 20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 254 N.E.2d 8 (1969); see\nalso State ex rel. Carmean v. Hardin Cty. Bd. of Edn., 170 Ohio St. 415, 422, 165\nN.E.2d 918 (1960) (“It is axiomatic in statutory construction that words are not\ninserted into an act without some purpose”).\n        {¶ 14} We conclude that the term “any storm water” was not included in\nthe statute to be mere surplusage. The Sewer District has the authority to collect,\ntreat, and dispose of “waste water.” We hold that R.C. 6119.011(K) identifies\ntwo types of “waste water,” one of which is “any storm water.” Accordingly, we\nconclude that the regional stormwater-management program falls within the\nstatutory authority of the Sewer District.\n        {¶ 15} The charter creating the Sewer District states, “The purpose of the\nDistrict shall be the establishment of a total waste water control system for the\ncollection, treatment and disposal of waste water within and without the\nDistrict * * *.”    In re Establishment of Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist.,\nCuyahoga C.P. No. SD 69411 (June 15, 1972), Exhibit A, ¶ 4. This authority\nincludes “overall control of all waste water collection systems in the area.” Id.\nGiven the statutory definition of “waste water,” as discussed above, it is clear that\nthe charter governing the Sewer District authorizes it to implement a regional\nstormwater-management program.          Moreover, the charter also states, “The\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nDistrict will plan, finance, construct, operate and control waste water treatment\nand disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and\ndevices, weirs, retaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other\nwater pollution control facilities of the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(c). This charter\nprovision specifically authorizes the Sewer District to build and operate\nstormwater-handling facilities.\nII. The Sewer District is authorized by statute and by its charter to assess fees to\n            implement the regional stormwater-management program\n       {¶ 16} Having determined that the Sewer District is authorized to\nimplement a regional stormwater-management program, we must now determine\nwhether the district has the authority to charge fees to pay for that program. R.C.\n6119.09 provides that “[a] regional water and sewer district may charge, alter, and\ncollect rentals or other charges * * * for the use or services of any water resource\nproject or any benefit conferred thereby.” R.C. 6119.011(G) defines a “water\nresource project” as\n\n\n       any waste water facility or water management facility acquired,\n       constructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer\n       district or to be acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a\n       regional water and sewer district under this chapter * * *.\n\n\n       {¶ 17} “Waste water facilities” means\n\n\n       facilities for the purpose of treating, neutralizing, disposing of,\n       stabilizing, cooling, segregating, or holding waste water, including,\n       without limiting the generality of the foregoing, * * * facilities for\n       the temporary or permanent impoundment of waste water, both\n       surface and underground, and storm and sanitary sewers and other\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n       systems, whether on the surface or underground, designed to\n       transport waste water * * *.\n\n\nR.C. 6119.011(L).\n\n\n       {¶ 18} “Water management facilities” means\n\n\n       facilities for the purpose of the development, use, and protection of\n       water resources, including, without limiting the generality of the\n       foregoing, facilities for water supply, facilities for stream flow\n       improvement, dams, reservoirs, and other impoundments, * * *\n       stream monitoring systems, facilities for the stabilization of stream\n       and river banks, and facilities for the treatment of streams and\n       rivers * * *.\n\n\nR.C. 6119.011(M).\n\n\n       {¶ 19} Appellees argue that the Sewer District cannot charge the fees\npermitted for a water resource project because the Sewer District does not own or\noperate the various parts of the current stormwater-management system. See R.C.\n6119.011(G). But the statutory definition of “water resource project” includes a\nfacility that is “to be acquired, constructed, or operated” by the Sewer District. Id.\nThe Sewer District may therefore charge fees for this purpose under R.C.\n6119.09.\n       {¶ 20} It is impossible to say at this time that the Sewer District will not\nuse the fees to acquire, construct, or operate a facility that will be part of the\nregional stormwater-management system that it is authorized to implement. It\nmight not, and if it does not, appellees will be within their rights to challenge the\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nSewer District’s collection of fees that did not go toward the use for which they\nwere statutorily authorized. But today is not that day.\n       {¶ 21} As stated above, the Sewer District’s charter instructs it to, among\nother things, “finance * * * waste water treatment and disposal facilities [and]\nstorm water handling facilities * * *.” In re Establishment of Cleveland Regional\nSewer Dist., Cuyahoga C.P. No. SD 69411, Exhibit A, ¶ 5(c)(1). The charter\nprovides that “[a]ny projects not financed through the Ohio Water Development\nAuthority would be financed in such a manner as may be deemed appropriate by\nthe Board of Trustees.” Id. at ¶ 5(e)(3). We conclude that this broad language\nencompasses the assessing of fees to pay for a stormwater-management system\nand that the fees are therefore authorized by the charter.\n       {¶ 22} Because we conclude that the Sewer District has authority to\nimplement a regional stormwater-management program and to charge fees for that\nprogram, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.\n                                                               Judgment reversed.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and LANZINGER and O’NEILL, JJ., concur.\n       FRENCH, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.\n       O’DONNELL and KENNEDY, JJ., dissent.\n                               _________________\n       FRENCH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n       {¶ 23} I agree with the majority that appellant, the Northeast Ohio\nRegional Sewer District (the “Sewer District”), has authority under both R.C.\nChapter 6119 and its charter to implement a regional stormwater-management\nprogram, but I respectfully disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the Sewer\nDistrict has statutory authority to finance that program by presently assessing the\nstormwater fees that are set out in Title V of its Code of Regulations, which\nimplements the stormwater-management program. Accordingly, I concur in part\nand dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                     January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 24} Both the majority opinion and Justice Kennedy’s dissent recognize\nthat the Sewer District’s statutory authority over stormwater hinges, in part, upon\nthe meaning of the term “waste water” in R.C. 6119.01(B) and, specifically, upon\nwhether that term includes uncontaminated stormwater. I agree with the majority\nopinion that R.C. 6119.011(K) is unambiguous.                  It defines “waste water” as\nencompassing two types of water: (1) “any storm water” and (2) “any water\ncontaining sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived\nfrom the prior use of the water.”1 Under R.C. 6119.01(B), the Sewer District has\nauthority to collect, treat, and dispose of stormwater, whether or not it contains\nsewage, industrial waste or other pollutants.\n        {¶ 25} Other provisions in R.C. Chapter 6119 reinforce the Sewer\nDistrict’s statutory authority over stormwater.              A regional water and sewer\ndistrict’s broad authority includes the authority to acquire, construct, improve,\nmaintain, repair, and operate water-resource projects, including waste-water\nfacilities and water-management facilities.             R.C. 6119.011(G) and (S); R.C.\n6119.06(G). Both “waste water facilities” and “water management facilities”\nencompass facilities dealing with stormwater.                 R.C. 6119.011(L) and (M).\nAdditionally, R.C. 6119.19 states that “the board of trustees of a regional water\nand sewer district may provide a system of sanitary and/or storm water sewerage,\nherein referred to only as sewerage, for any part of the area included within the\ndistrict.” (Emphasis added.)           Based upon these provisions and the statutory\ndefinition of “waste water,” which encompasses stormwater, I agree with the\n\n\n\n1\n  Ohio is not alone in including stormwater within its definition of wastewater. See, e.g.,\nKy.Rev.Stat.Ann. 65.8903(4) (“ ‘Wastewater’ includes stormwater”); N.J.Stat.Ann. 58:27-3(e)\n(“ ‘Wastewater’ means residential, commercial, industrial, or agricultural liquid waste, sewerage,\nstorm water runoff, or any combination thereof * * *”); Wis.Adm.Code SPS 381.01(276)\n(“ ‘Wastewater’ means clear water, storm water, domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater,\nsewage or any combination of these”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nmajority’s conclusion that the Sewer District has the authority to manage\nstormwater.\n       {¶ 26} I likewise agree with the majority that the Sewer District’s charter\nauthorizes it to implement a regional stormwater-management program. The\ncharter tracks the language of R.C. 6119.01(B) and states the Sewer District’s\npurpose as “the establishment of a total wastewater control system for the\ncollection, treatment and disposal of wastewater within and without the District.”\nIn re Establishment of Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist., Cuyahoga C.P. No. SD\n69411 (May 25, 1979), Exhibit A, ¶ 4. In light of the inclusion of stormwater\nwithin the preexisting statutory definition of “waste water,” the charter authorizes\nthe Sewer District to establish a stormwater-management system, consistent with\nR.C. Chapter 6119.\n       {¶ 27} Water pollution, stemming from “[t]he increase in the amount of\nwastewater in the Metropolitan Cleveland area resulting from the increase in\npopulation and the expansion of industry in the many political subdivisions\noutside of the City of Cleveland,” was a driving force behind the creation of the\nSewer District. Id. at ¶ 3. The charter authorizes the Sewer District to “plan,\nfinance, construct, operate and control wastewater treatment and disposal\nfacilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and devices,\nweirs, retaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other water\npollution control facilities of the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(c)(1). But the charter also\nexpressly authorizes the Sewer District to undertake stormwater-control measures.\nParagraph 5(m), which governs the Sewer District’s authority with respect to\n“Local Sewerage Collection Facilities and Systems,” states that “[t]he District\nshall have authority pursuant to Chapter 6119 of the Ohio Revised Code to plan,\nfinance, construct, maintain, operate, and regulate local sewerage collection\nfacilities and systems within the District, including both storm and sanitary sewer\nsystems.” (Emphasis added.) And paragraph 5(m)(3) specifically directs the\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                               January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nSewer District to “develop a detailed integrated capital improvement plan for\nregional management of wastewater collection and storm drainage designed to\nidentify a capital improvement program for the solution of all intercommunity\ndrainage problems (both storm and sanitary) in the District.”\n       {¶ 28} Appellees, political subdivisions and property owners within the\nSewer District, argue that Title V of the Sewer District’s Code of Regulations,\nwhich sets out the regional stormwater-management program, conflicts with the\ncharter’s provision that local communities retain authority and responsibility for\nmaintaining and operating their local sewerage collection systems absent a written\nagreement placing that responsibility on the Sewer District. But Title V does not\nprovide for the Sewer District’s ownership of or responsibility for sewerage\ncollection facilities and systems owned or operated by the member communities,\nand the Sewer District asserts that it does not intend to interfere with the member\ncommunities’ local systems.\n       {¶ 29} Title V distinguishes between local stormwater systems and the\nregional stormwater system. “Regional Stormwater System” means “[t]he entire\nsystem of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and Stormwater\nControl Measures in the District’s service area that are owned and/or operated by\nthe District or over which the District has right of use for the management of\nstormwater, including both naturally occurring and constructed facilities.”\nNortheast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. Code of Regs., Section 5.0218. “Local\nStormwater System,” on the other hand, includes watercourses, stormwater-\nconveyance structures or stormwater-control measures “owned and/or operated by\na private entity or a unit of local government other than the District” and “not\ndesignated as part of the Regional Stormwater System.” Id., Section 5.0212. So,\nthe regional stormwater system does not include watercourses, conveyance\nstructures or stormwater-control measures owned or operated by the local\ncommunities absent agreement between the local communities and the Sewer\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nDistrict. By limiting the reach of the regional stormwater system, Title V does\nnot conflict with the Sewer District’s charter, and I agree with the majority that\nthe charter authorizes the Sewer District to build and operate a regional\nstormwater-management system.\n       {¶ 30} Despite my agreement with the majority’s determination that the\nSewer District has authority to manage uncontaminated stormwater, I disagree\nwith the majority’s conclusion that R.C. 6119.09 authorizes the stormwater fees\nset out in Title V. Appellees argue that the Sewer District cannot impose its\nstormwater fees for two reasons: (1) because R.C. Chapter 6119 does not\nauthorize the fees and (2) because the fees amount to an unlawful tax.\n       {¶ 31} In her dissent, Justice Kennedy adopts appellees’ second\nargument—that the charges amount to an unlawful tax. But I agree with the\nSewer District’s assertion that that issue is not properly before us. The Sewer\nDistrict asked this court to adopt a proposition of law stating that stormwater-\nmanagement charges based upon the amount of impervious surface a parcel\ncontains—like the stormwater fees here—do not constitute an illegal tax. This\ncourt, however, declined jurisdiction over that proposition of law. Northeast Ohio\nRegional Sewer Dist. v. Bath Twp., 138 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, 3\nN.E.3d 1216. Having declined jurisdiction over that proposition of law, the\nquestion whether the stormwater fees are an unlawful tax is not before the court.\n       {¶ 32} In my view, it is appellees’ other argument—regarding statutory\nauthority—that is persuasive.     The majority reasons that because a “water\nresource project” includes a facility to be acquired, constructed or operated, the\nSewer District may charge fees for that purpose under R.C. 6119.09.                 I\nrespectfully disagree.\n       {¶ 33} R.C. 6119.09 authorizes a regional water and sewer district to\n\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n       “charge, alter, and collect rentals or other charges * * * for the use\n       or services of any water resource project or any benefit conferred\n       thereby and contract * * * with one or more persons, one or more\n       political subdivisions, or any combination thereof, desiring the use\n       or services thereof, and fix the terms, conditions, rentals, or other\n       charges * * * for such use or services.”\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) See also R.C. 6119.06(W). The Sewer District contends that\nits stormwater fees represent charges for the use, services or benefits of a water-\nresource project.\n       {¶ 34} Although R.C. 6119.011(G) defines “water resource project” to\ninclude a project “to be acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a\nregional water and sewer district,” the district may charge only “for the use or\nservices of” or “any benefit conferred” by a water-resource project.            R.C.\n6119.09. R.C. 6119.09 contemplates uses or services that may be contracted for.\nThe question, therefore, resolves to whether a water-resource project that will be\nacquired, constructed or operated in the future affords uses, services or benefits in\nthe present, so as to authorize charges under R.C. 6119.09—a question the\nmajority does not address.\n       {¶ 35} The Eighth District concluded that the Sewer District “improperly\nemployed R.C. 6119.09 to generate revenues for the costs of its” regional\nstormwater-management program because the stormwater fees are “unrelated to\nany use or services afforded to a property owner by a ‘water resource project.’ ”\n2013-Ohio-4186, 999 N.E.2d 181, ¶ 53, 56. Appellees likewise contend that the\nSewer District may not impose stormwater fees for a water-resource project that\nthe Sewer District has not yet acquired, constructed or operated, because until it\nhas done so, there is no use, service or benefit for which to charge.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          {¶ 36} The Sewer District directs this court to the trial court’s factual\nfindings regarding the uses and services the regional stormwater-management\nprogram provides. The trial court found that property owners within the Sewer\nDistrict passively “ ‘use’ the unmanaged Regional Stormwater System as rainfall\ncreates runoff from each parcel.” The trial court also found that the Sewer\nDistrict provides the “service of effective transportation of stormwater,” resulting\nin decreased flooding and erosion. Finally, the court stated that the regional\nstormwater-management system will provide benefits, including improvements in\nwater quality and wildlife habitats and the reduction of future stormwater-\nmanagement costs. But those findings depend upon the Sewer District acquiring,\nconstructing, and operating a water-resource project. Whether property owners\nwould benefit in the future from the system the Sewer District intends to create\nand operate sidesteps the relevant issue: whether the Sewer District currently\noffers uses or services relating to the stormwater-management system for which it\nmay charge.\n          {¶ 37} Nothing in R.C. 6119.09 suggests that the Sewer District may\npresently impose a fee for uses or services it will be able to provide only in the\nfuture.    The statute requires current usage, service or benefits to justify the\ncollection of stormwater fees. Until the Sewer District acquires, constructs or\nbegins to operate a water-resource project relating to regional stormwater\nmanagement, it has no use, service or benefit to provide in exchange for the\nstormwater fees it seeks to extract from property owners.\n          {¶ 38} Even so, the Sewer District is not without recourse. A regional\nwater and sewer district may levy and collect taxes and special assessments and\nmay issue revenue bonds. R.C. 6119.06(I) and (J); R.C. 6119.12; R.C. 6119.18;\nR.C. 6119.42. It may receive and accept grants from federal and state agencies\nfor or in aid of the construction of water-resource projects. R.C. 6119.06(U).\nAnd it may enter into cooperative agreements with one or more political\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nsubdivisions to fund the acquisition or construction of a water-resource project.\nR.C. 6119.09.\n       {¶ 39} Because I conclude that R.C. 6119.09 does not authorize the Sewer\nDistrict to impose stormwater fees for the use and service of a water-resource\nproject to be acquired, constructed or operated by the Sewer District in the future,\nI dissent from the majority’s determination that the Sewer District is presently\nauthorized to impose the stormwater fees set out in Title V of its Code of\nRegulations. In all other respects, I concur.\n                               _________________\n       KENNEDY, J., dissenting.\n       {¶ 40} Respectfully, I dissent.    I would hold that the Northeast Ohio\nRegional Sewer District (the “Sewer District”) lacks authority to manage\nstormwater as proposed in the Sewer District’s Stormwater Management Code\n(“SMC”) or to charge a fee to manage stormwater.\n                                R.C. Chapter 6119\n       {¶ 41} R.C. Chapter 6119 addresses the creation and authority of regional\nsewer districts. As creatures of statute, sewer districts “have no more authority\nthan that conferred upon them by the statute, or what is clearly implied\ntherefrom.” See Hall v. Lakeview Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., 63 Ohio St.3d\n380, 383, 588 N.E.2d 785 (1992). “Implied powers are those that are incidental\nor ancillary to an expressly granted power; the express grant of power must be\nclear, and any doubt as to the extent of the grant must be resolved against it.” In\nre Guardianship of Spangler, 126 Ohio St.3d 339, 2010-Ohio-2471, 933 N.E.2d\n1067, ¶ 17.\n       {¶ 42} The Sewer District is authorized “[t]o provide for the collection,\ntreatment, and disposal of waste water within and without the district” pursuant to\nR.C. 6119.01. “ ‘Waste water’ means any storm water and any water containing\nsewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nprior use of the water.” R.C. 6119.011(K). I agree with appellees and the court\nof appeals that “waste water” necessarily means water containing waste.\n       {¶ 43} The majority holds that R.C. 6119.011(K) authorizes the District to\nmanage two types of water—stormwater and water that is polluted or\ncontaminated. I disagree. In my view, the definition of “waste water” is water\nthat “contain[s] sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants.”\nR.C. 6119.011(K). This conclusion is supported by the purpose of the Sewer\nDistrict, which is “to provide for collection, treatment, and disposal of waste\nwater.” (Emphasis added.) R.C. 6119.01. Therefore, because the Sewer District\nis only authorized to treat water that contains waste, it has no authority to treat\nstormwater runoff, which the SMC defines as stormwater “that flows into ditches,\nwater courses, storm sewers, or other concentrated flow patterns during and\nfollowing precipitation, including rain runoff, snowmelt runoff, and surface\nrunoff.”\n                                     The SMC\n       {¶ 44} The SMC proposes a comprehensive, broad-ranging plan to\nmanage stormwater that is beyond the Sewer District’s authority under R.C.\nChapter 6119. The Sewer District found that flooding and streambank erosion are\n“significant threats” within the District.     Consequently, the Sewer District\ndetermined that a “Regional Stormwater Management Program is necessary” to\naddress these threats and their impacts on northeast Ohio’s water resources. The\nregional stormwater-management program would include “[c]omprehensive\nmanagement     of   the   Regional   Stormwater    System,”    “construction   and\nimplementation of necessary Stormwater Control Measures to address current,\nand minimize new flooding and erosion issues affecting the Regional Stormwater\nSystem,” as well as “inspection, operation, maintenance, and monitoring\nactivities,” including but not limited to clearing debris from blocked culverts,\n\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nbridge abutments, and repair of streambank erosion. The “Regional Stormwater\nSystem” is extensive and includes:\n\n\n                 The   entire   system   of    watercourses,   stormwater\n         conveyance structures, and Stormwater Control Measures in the\n         District’s service area that are owned and/or operated by the\n         District or over which the District has right of use for the\n         management of stormwater, including both naturally occurring\n         and constructed facilities. The Regional Stormwater System\n         shall   generally   include   those   watercourses,   stormwater\n         conveyance structures, and Stormwater Control Measures\n         receiving drainage from three hundred (300) acres of land or\n         more.\n\n\n       {¶ 45} The SMC further states that it “is applicable to activities and\npersons on all parcels within the Sewer District’s service area.” The District will\ncharge every parcel of land within the District a stormwater fee to fund the\naforementioned stormwater-control measures.\n       {¶ 46} Nowhere in Chapter 6119 is flooding or erosion control discussed.\nIn large part, the SMC seeks to manage “pure” stormwater, i.e. water resulting\nfrom precipitation that is not mixed with pollutants or contaminants and that never\nenters the sanitary sewer system. Management of this water is beyond the scope\nof the Sewer District’s authority, which is to collect, treat, and dispose of waste\nwater, which is water that contains waste, i.e., pollutants or contaminants.\nTherefore, I would hold that the Sewer District has no statutory authority to\nimplement the SMC.\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                 Stormwater “Fees”\n       {¶ 47} Initially, I will address the concurring and dissenting opinion’s\nassertion that the issue of whether a stormwater fee is a lawful tax is not properly\nbefore the court.\n       {¶ 48} Even though the reasons are not typically memorialized, this court\nmay reject one or more propositions of law or an entire discretionary appeal for\nany number of reasons. See Williamson v. Rubich, 171 Ohio St. 253, 253-254,\n168 N.E.2d 876 (1960), citing Oho Constitution, Article IV, Section 6 (whether\nquestions presented to this court for appellate review “are in fact ones of public or\ngreat general interest rests within the discretion of the court”). However, I can\nfind no authority that a rejected proposition of law creates a bar or waiver upon a\nparty’s argument when set forth in a legitimate response to an opposing party’s\nproposition of law that has been accepted by the court. Nor can I find any\nauthority that would preclude the court from considering and relying upon such an\nargument.\n       {¶ 49} The Sewer District raised three propositions of law in its\ndiscretionary appeal to this court. We accepted the Sewer District’s first two\npropositions for review on their merits, 138 Ohio St.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, 3\nN.E.3d 1216, but declined to review the third proposition, which stated\n“Stormwater management programs, paid for through charges for stormwater\nmanagement services, do not violate the Ohio or United States Constitutions.\nFurther, such charges, when based upon the amount of impervious surface on a\nproperty, do not constitute an illegal tax.”\n       {¶ 50} One of the two propositions that we accepted stated “A district\nformed pursuant to R.C. Chapter 6119 is authorized to manage stormwater which\nis not combined with sewage, and to impose a charge for that purpose. Such a\ncharge is one ‘for the use or service of a water resource project or any benefit\nconferred thereby.’ ” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 51} In response to that proposition, appellee city of Beachwood argued\nin its merit brief in part that “[t]he Stormwater Fee is actually an unauthorized tax\nthat the Sewer District is using to avoid other required R.C. Chapter 6119\nrevenue-generating procedures.” Beachwood’s argument is an apt challenge to\nthe Sewer District’s assertion that the proposed charge for stormwater\nmanagement is authorized.       To prevent Beachwood from making such an\nargument based on our initial declination to consider this issue would infringe\nupon Beachwood’s ability to make arguments of its own choosing and to fully\nrespond to the Sewer District’s propositions of law that we accepted in this\nappeal. And unlike issues raised for the first time in a reply brief, where the\nopposing party has no ability to respond, Beachwood raised the unlawful tax\nargument in its merit brief, affording the Sewer District an opportunity to refute\nthe argument in its reply brief. Compare In re C.Z., 12th Dist. Warren Nos.\nCA2005-06-065, CA2005-06-066, CA2005-06-081, and CA2005-06-082, 2006-\nOhio-1787, ¶ 20 (raising a new assignment of error in a reply brief precludes the\nopposing party from responding to that argument).\n       {¶ 52} Obviously, this court may reject any argument presented by a\nparty, but this court’s refusal to review a proposition of law should not bar an\nopposing party from later using the same or a similar issue raised in that\nproposition in a legitimate, responsive argument to an opposing party’s\nproposition of law that is being considered by the court, nor should it prevent this\ncourt from relying upon such an argument. Under the facts of this case, I would\nhold that the court is justified in considering Beachwood’s responsive argument\nthat the Sewer District’s proposed fee is really an unlawful tax, even though the\ncourt declined to accept the Sewer District’s proposition of law on that issue for\nreview. Having addressed this threshold issue, I will proceed to address the\nmerits of whether the stormwater fee is an unlawful tax.\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 53} A sewer district may “charge, alter, and collect rentals or other\ncharges, including penalties for late payment, for the use or services of any water\nresource project or any benefit conferred thereby.” R.C. 6119.09; see also R.C.\n6119.06(W)(1). A “water resource project” is defined under R.C. 6119.011(G) as\n“any waste water facility or water management facility acquired, constructed, or\noperated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district or to be acquired,\nconstructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district under\nthis chapter * * *.”\n       {¶ 54} In this case, the Sewer District, through the SMC, seeks to impose\na “stormwater fee” on parcels of land in the District to pay for the management of\nstormwater.    The fee, which is “based upon a calculation of the amount of\nImpervious Surface on a parcel[,] shall be imposed on every parcel within the\nDistrict’s service area.”\n       {¶ 55} In my view, this fee is actually a tax, which does not appear to have\nbeen lawfully imposed. See R.C. 6119.18; see also Sanborn v. Hamilton Cty.\nBudget Comm., 142 Ohio St.3d 20, 2014-Ohio-5218, 27 N.E.3d 498, ¶ 5-7, citing\nOhio Constitution, Article XII, Section 2.\n       {¶ 56} “It is not possible to come up with a single test that will correctly\ndistinguish a tax from a fee in all situations * * *.” State ex rel. Petroleum\nUnderground Storage Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Withrow, 62 Ohio St.3d 111,\n117, 579 N.E.2d 705 (1991). Therefore, “[d]etermining whether an assessment is\na fee or a tax must be done on a case-by-case basis dependent upon the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding each assessment.” Id. at 115.\n       {¶ 57} Some factors that may indicate that an assessment is a fee include:\n(1) the assessment is “imposed in furtherance of regulatory measures,” (2) the\nassessment is not placed in the general fund, but is used only to fund the\nregulatory purpose, (3) the assessment is “ ‘imposed by a government in return for\na service it provides,’ ” and (4) the assessment is discontinued when the\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f                               January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nunobligated balance in the fund reaches a certain level.

United States, 415 U.S. 336,\n340-341, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 39 L.Ed.2d 379, the court commented:\n\n\n                Taxation is a legislative function [where the legislature]\n         may act arbitrarily and disregard benefits bestowed by the\n         Government on a taxpayer and go solely on ability to pay, based\n         on property or income. A fee, however, is incident to a\n         voluntary act, e.g., a request that a public agency permit an\n         applicant to practice law or medicine or construct a house or run\n         a broadcast station. The public agency performing those\n         services normally may exact a fee for a grant which,\n         presumably, bestows a benefit on the applicant, not shared by\n         other members of society.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n       {¶ 59} An example of a fee charged for a service is found in\nWyatt v. Trimble Twp. Waste Water Treatment Dist., 4th Dist. Athens\nNo. 1521, 1992 WL 329386 (Nov. 3, 1992). In Wyatt, the Trimble\nTownship Waste Water Treatment District charged a homeowner for the\ninstallation of a plug at the point where each premises was to be\nconnected to an existing sanitary sewer system for the purpose of waste-\nwater treatment. The court found that the fee was in return for a benefit\nconferred, i.e., treatment of the homeowner’s waste water. Id. at *3.\n       {¶ 60} In Bolt v. Lansing, 459 Mich. 152, 587 N.W.2d 264, the\nSupreme Court of Michigan addressed whether a stormwater service\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncharge imposed by the city of Lansing on its residents for the purpose of\nstormwater control was a fee or a tax.\n          {¶ 61} In Bolt, Lansing decided to separate its combined sanitary\nand storm sewers. To finance this project, Lansing decided to impose a\nstormwater service charge. Similar to the instant case, the fee was based\non the amount of impervious surface that a parcel contained. The court\nstated:\n\n\n                  A proper fee must reflect the bestowal of a\n           corresponding benefit on the person paying the charge, which\n           benefit is not generally shared by other members of society.\n           Nat’l Cable Television Ass’n v. United States & Federal\n           Communications Comm, 415 U.S. 336, 340-342, 94 S.Ct. 1146,\n           39 L.Ed.2d 370 (1974). Where the charge for either storm or\n           sanitary sewers reflects the actual costs of use, metered with\n           relative precision in accordance with available technology,\n           including some capital investment component, sewerage may\n           properly be viewed as a utility service for which usage-based\n           charges are permissible, and not as a disguised tax.\n\n\nId. at 164-165.\n          {¶ 62} But the court held that “the lack of correspondence\nbetween the [stormwater service] charges and the benefit conferred\ndemonstrates that the city has failed to differentiate any particularized\nbenefits to property owners from the general benefits conferred on the\npublic.” Id. at 166. The court continued:\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                               January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n               This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the\n       acknowledged goal of the ordinance is to address environmental\n       concerns regarding water quality. Improved water quality in the\n       Grand and Red Cedar Rivers and the avoidance of federal\n       penalties for discharge violations are goals that benefit everyone\n       in the city, not only property owners.\n\n\nId.\n       {¶ 63} Pursuant to my interpretation of “waste water” above, I do not\nbelieve that the Sewer District has authority to manage stormwater; consequently,\nthe assessment fails to support a regulatory purpose, which is a factor that can\nsupport a finding that it is indeed a fee and not a tax. See Drees Co., 132 Ohio\nSt.3d 186, 2012-Ohio-2370, 970 N.E.2d 916, at ¶ 16-20.                However, even\nassuming that the Sewer District has statutory authority to manage stormwater as\nproposed in the SMC, the purported fee fails to meet other indicia of a true fee.\n       {¶ 64} In the instant case, the Sewer District found that the SWC is\nnecessary (1) to prevent flooding to public and private property, (2) to prevent\n“[s]treambank erosion[, which] is a significant threat to public and private\nproperty, water quality, wildlife, and aquatic and terrestrial habitats,” and (3) to\nprevent “damage[ to] the water resources of Northeast Ohio, [which] impair[s] the\nability of these waters to sustain ecological and aquatic systems.”\n       {¶ 65} Despite the district’s claims that the SMC will benefit private\nproperty, I would hold that alleviating these problems results in a benefit that is\nconferred on the general public rather than on individual property owners. See\nNatl. Cable Television Assn., Inc., 415 U.S. at 340-342, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 39 L.Ed.2d\n370; Bolt, 459 Mich. at 164-165, 587 N.W.2d 264.\n       {¶ 66} Further, as evidenced by this lawsuit, at minimum there are\nnumerous municipalities (e.g., Beechwood, Bedford Heights, Brecksville,\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nIndependence, Lyndhurst, and Strongsville) and other entities (e.g., Highlands\nBusiness Park, L.L.C., Lakepoint Office Park, L.L.C., Park East Office Park,\nL.L.C., and the Ohio Counsel of Retail Merchants) that oppose the SMC.\nVoluntary acceptance of a service is another indicator that an assessment is a fee\nand not a tax. Natl. Cable Television Assn. at 340.\n       {¶ 67} For all the aforementioned reasons, I would hold that the Sewer\nDistrict’s stormwater fee is not a fee, but an unlawful tax.\n                                    Conclusion\n       {¶ 68} Because I would hold that R.C. Chapter 6119 does not authorize\nthe type of stormwater regulation that the SMC seeks to impose and that the\nstormwater fee is actually an unlawful tax, I would affirm the judgment of the\ncourt of appeals and hold that the Sewer District does not have the authority to\nimplement the SMC. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n       O’DONNELL, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n                               _________________\n       Thacker Martinsek, L.P.A., and Mark I.

We disagree and reverse the\njudgment of the court of appeals.\n                                    BACKGROUND\n       {¶ 2} The Sewer District, a political subdivision of the state of Ohio, was\nformed in 1972 and includes as member communities all or parts of over 60 cities,\nvillages, and townships in and around Cuyahoga County. In January 2010, the\nSewer District adopted a plan to establish a regional stormwater-management\nprogram and a structure for fees to be charged to landowners within the Sewer\nDistrict whose properties contain impervious surfaces. The Sewer District then\nfiled an action in common pleas court against its member communities seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it had the authority to implement the regional\nstormwater-management program and to impose the fees. Some of those member\ncommunities and several intervening landowners argued that the Sewer District\nlacked authority to implement the program and fees under R.C. Chapter 6119 and\nthe Sewer District’s charter and that the fees were unconstitutional.\n       {¶ 3} In April 2011, the trial court declared, upon a motion for partial\nsummary judgment, that the Sewer District had authority under R.C. Chapter\n6119 and its charter to enact a regional stormwater-management program. The\ncourt of appeals reversed. It properly concluded that as a creature of statute, the\nSewer District’s authority is limited by the statutory scheme that created it. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2013-Ohio-4186, ¶ 40. The court of appeals stated that\n\n\n       the purpose of a regional water and sewer district is for “either or\n       both” of the following purposes: “(A) [t]o supply water to users\n       within or without the district”; and “(B) [t]o provide for the\n       collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water within and\n       without the district.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n(Brackets sic.) Id. at ¶ 43, quoting R.C. 6119.01(A) and (B).\n        {¶ 4} The court of appeals concluded that although the statutory scheme\n“authorize[s] the Sewer District to collect, treat, and dispose of waste water\nentering the sewer system,” it “does not authorize the District to implement a\n‘stormwater management’ program.” Id. at ¶ 43 and 46. This conclusion depends\nin large part upon the court’s pronouncement that “[t]he term waste water\nnecessarily means water containing waste.” Id. at ¶ 44, citing Reith v.

Chapter 6119 to charge fees to pay for the\nstormwater-management program. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that\nthe fees were “not for the ‘use or service’ of a ‘water resource project.’ ”\n        {¶ 6} We granted the Sewer District’s discretionary appeal as to\nProposition of Law No. I (asserting that the program and fees are authorized\nunder R.C. Chapter 6119) and Proposition of Law No. II (asserting that the\nprogram and fees are authorized under the Sewer District’s charter). 138 Ohio\nSt.3d 1413, 2014-Ohio-566, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n                                     ANALYSIS\n        {¶ 7} Despite the great interests at stake, the issues in this case are\nexceedingly straightforward: (1) is the Sewer District’s regional stormwater-\nmanagement program authorized by statute and by its charter and (2) is the\nattendant fee structure authorized by statute and by the charter. We answer both\nquestions in the affirmative.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nI. The regional stormwater-management program is authorized by statute and by\n                             the Sewer District’s charter\n        {¶ 8} There are many sound policy reasons to support or oppose the\ncreation of the Sewer District’s regional stormwater-management program and its\nattendant fee structure. The various party and amicus briefs are testaments to this.\nAlthough we appreciate their substantive significance, they are not germane to the\nlegal issues before us.\n        {¶ 9} The parties do not dispute that the Sewer District is a valid creature\nof statute, authorized by R.C. Chapter 6119. The Sewer District’s ability to create\na regional stormwater-management program must, then, have its basis in the\nstatutory scheme, which provides only two valid purposes for a regional water or\nsewer district. The district must “supply water,” which the sewer district does\nnot, or it must “provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water.”\nR.C. 6119.01.\n        {¶ 10} R.C. 6119.011(K) defines “waste water” as “any storm water and\nany water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or\ncontaminants derived from the prior use of the water.” Despite its plain language,\nthe parties’ interpretations of this definition are radically different.\n        {¶ 11} Appellees argue, and the court of appeals concluded, that “[t]he\nterm waste water necessarily means water containing waste.” 2013-Ohio-4186,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 44. Appellees contend that the participial phrase “containing\nsewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the\nprior use of the water” modifies the noun “any storm water” as well as the noun\n“any water,” which would mean that stormwater is only “waste water” when it is\ncombined with sewage or pollutants.\n        {¶ 12} The definition provided in the statute is uncomplicated.          See\nYoungstown Club v. Porterfield, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970) (“it\nis customary to give words their plain ordinary meaning unless the legislative\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nbody has clearly expressed a contrary intention”). In our view, the statute plainly\nindicates that “waste water” comes in two forms. One is “any storm water.” The\nother is “any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or\ncontaminants derived from the prior use of the water.” There is no other plausible\nreading of the definition.\n        {¶ 13} The definition sought by appellees renders the words “any storm\nwater and” meaningless. But the words “any storm water and” are in the statute,\nand it is well known that our duty is to “give effect to the words used, not to\ndelete words used or to insert words not used.” Columbus-Suburban Coach\nLines, Inc. v.

The Sewer District has the authority to collect,\ntreat, and dispose of “waste water.” We hold that R.C. 6119.011(K) identifies\ntwo types of “waste water,” one of which is “any storm water.” Accordingly, we\nconclude that the regional stormwater-management program falls within the\nstatutory authority of the Sewer District.\n        {¶ 15} The charter creating the Sewer District states, “The purpose of the\nDistrict shall be the establishment of a total waste water control system for the\ncollection, treatment and disposal of waste water within and without the\nDistrict * * *.”    In re Establishment of Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist.,\nCuyahoga C.P. No. SD 69411 (June 15, 1972), Exhibit A, ¶ 4. This authority\nincludes “overall control of all waste water collection systems in the area.” Id.\nGiven the statutory definition of “waste water,” as discussed above, it is clear that\nthe charter governing the Sewer District authorizes it to implement a regional\nstormwater-management program.          Moreover, the charter also states, “The\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nDistrict will plan, finance, construct, operate and control waste water treatment\nand disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and\ndevices, weirs, retaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other\nwater pollution control facilities of the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(c). This charter\nprovision specifically authorizes the Sewer District to build and operate\nstormwater-handling facilities.\nII. The Sewer District is authorized by statute and by its charter to assess fees to\n            implement the regional stormwater-management program\n       {¶ 16} Having determined that the Sewer District is authorized to\nimplement a regional stormwater-management program, we must now determine\nwhether the district has the authority to charge fees to pay for that program. R.C.\n6119.09 provides that “[a] regional water and sewer district may charge, alter, and\ncollect rentals or other charges * * * for the use or services of any water resource\nproject or any benefit conferred thereby.” R.C. 6119.011(G) defines a “water\nresource project” as\n\n\n       any waste water facility or water management facility acquired,\n       constructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer\n       district or to be acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a\n       regional water and sewer district under this chapter * * *.\n\n\n       {¶ 17} “Waste water facilities” means\n\n\n       facilities for the purpose of treating, neutralizing, disposing of,\n       stabilizing, cooling, segregating, or holding waste water, including,\n       without limiting the generality of the foregoing, * * * facilities for\n       the temporary or permanent impoundment of waste water, both\n       surface and underground, and storm and sanitary sewers and other\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n       systems, whether on the surface or underground, designed to\n       transport waste water * * *.\n\n\nR.C. 6119.011(L).\n\n\n       {¶ 18} “Water management facilities” means\n\n\n       facilities for the purpose of the development, use, and protection of\n       water resources, including, without limiting the generality of the\n       foregoing, facilities for water supply, facilities for stream flow\n       improvement, dams, reservoirs, and other impoundments, * * *\n       stream monitoring systems, facilities for the stabilization of stream\n       and river banks, and facilities for the treatment of streams and\n       rivers * * *.\n\n\nR.C. 6119.011(M).\n\n\n       {¶ 19} Appellees argue that the Sewer District cannot charge the fees\npermitted for a water resource project because the Sewer District does not own or\noperate the various parts of the current stormwater-management system. See R.C.\n6119.011(G). But the statutory definition of “water resource project” includes a\nfacility that is “to be acquired, constructed, or operated” by the Sewer District. Id.\nThe Sewer District may therefore charge fees for this purpose under R.C.\n6119.09.\n       {¶ 20} It is impossible to say at this time that the Sewer District will not\nuse the fees to acquire, construct, or operate a facility that will be part of the\nregional stormwater-management system that it is authorized to implement. It\nmight not, and if it does not, appellees will be within their rights to challenge the\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nSewer District’s collection of fees that did not go toward the use for which they\nwere statutorily authorized. But today is not that day.\n       {¶ 21} As stated above, the Sewer District’s charter instructs it to, among\nother things, “finance * * * waste water treatment and disposal facilities [and]\nstorm water handling facilities * * *.” In re Establishment of Cleveland Regional\nSewer Dist., Cuyahoga C.P. No. SD 69411, Exhibit A, ¶ 5(c)(1). The charter\nprovides that “[a]ny projects not financed through the Ohio Water Development\nAuthority would be financed in such a manner as may be deemed appropriate by\nthe Board of Trustees.” Id. at ¶ 5(e)(3). We conclude that this broad language\nencompasses the assessing of fees to pay for a stormwater-management system\nand that the fees are therefore authorized by the charter.\n       {¶ 22} Because we conclude that the Sewer District has authority to\nimplement a regional stormwater-management program and to charge fees for that\nprogram, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.\n                                                               Judgment reversed.\n       O’CONNOR, C.J., and LANZINGER and O’NEILL, JJ., concur.\n       FRENCH, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.\n       O’DONNELL and KENNEDY, JJ., dissent.\n                               _________________\n       FRENCH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n       {¶ 23} I agree with the majority that appellant, the Northeast Ohio\nRegional Sewer District (the “Sewer District”), has authority under both R.C.\nChapter 6119 and its charter to implement a regional stormwater-management\nprogram, but I respectfully disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the Sewer\nDistrict has statutory authority to finance that program by presently assessing the\nstormwater fees that are set out in Title V of its Code of Regulations, which\nimplements the stormwater-management program. Accordingly, I concur in part\nand dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                     January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n        {¶ 24} Both the majority opinion and Justice Kennedy’s dissent recognize\nthat the Sewer District’s statutory authority over stormwater hinges, in part, upon\nthe meaning of the term “waste water” in R.C. 6119.01(B) and, specifically, upon\nwhether that term includes uncontaminated stormwater. I agree with the majority\nopinion that R.C. 6119.011(K) is unambiguous.                  It defines “waste water” as\nencompassing two types of water: (1) “any storm water” and (2) “any water\ncontaining sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived\nfrom the prior use of the water.”1 Under R.C. 6119.01(B), the Sewer District has\nauthority to collect, treat, and dispose of stormwater, whether or not it contains\nsewage, industrial waste or other pollutants.\n        {¶ 25} Other provisions in R.C. Chapter 6119 reinforce the Sewer\nDistrict’s statutory authority over stormwater.              A regional water and sewer\ndistrict’s broad authority includes the authority to acquire, construct, improve,\nmaintain, repair, and operate water-resource projects, including waste-water\nfacilities and water-management facilities.             R.C. 6119.011(G) and (S); R.C.\n6119.06(G). Both “waste water facilities” and “water management facilities”\nencompass facilities dealing with stormwater.                 R.C. 6119.011(L) and (M).\nAdditionally, R.C. 6119.19 states that “the board of trustees of a regional water\nand sewer district may provide a system of sanitary and/or storm water sewerage,\nherein referred to only as sewerage, for any part of the area included within the\ndistrict.” (Emphasis added.)           Based upon these provisions and the statutory\ndefinition of “waste water,” which encompasses stormwater, I agree with the\n\n\n\n1\n  Ohio is not alone in including stormwater within its definition of wastewater. See, e.g.,\nKy.Rev.Stat.Ann. 65.8903(4) (“ ‘Wastewater’ includes stormwater”); N.J.Stat.Ann. 58:27-3(e)\n(“ ‘Wastewater’ means residential, commercial, industrial, or agricultural liquid waste, sewerage,\nstorm water runoff, or any combination thereof * * *”); Wis.Adm.Code SPS 381.01(276)\n(“ ‘Wastewater’ means clear water, storm water, domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater,\nsewage or any combination of these”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nmajority’s conclusion that the Sewer District has the authority to manage\nstormwater.\n       {¶ 26} I likewise agree with the majority that the Sewer District’s charter\nauthorizes it to implement a regional stormwater-management program. The\ncharter tracks the language of R.C. 6119.01(B) and states the Sewer District’s\npurpose as “the establishment of a total wastewater control system for the\ncollection, treatment and disposal of wastewater within and without the District.”\nIn re Establishment of Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist., Cuyahoga C.P. No. SD\n69411 (May 25, 1979), Exhibit A, ¶ 4. In light of the inclusion of stormwater\nwithin the preexisting statutory definition of “waste water,” the charter authorizes\nthe Sewer District to establish a stormwater-management system, consistent with\nR.C. Chapter 6119.\n       {¶ 27} Water pollution, stemming from “[t]he increase in the amount of\nwastewater in the Metropolitan Cleveland area resulting from the increase in\npopulation and the expansion of industry in the many political subdivisions\noutside of the City of Cleveland,” was a driving force behind the creation of the\nSewer District. Id. at ¶ 3. The charter authorizes the Sewer District to “plan,\nfinance, construct, operate and control wastewater treatment and disposal\nfacilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and devices,\nweirs, retaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other water\npollution control facilities of the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(c)(1). But the charter also\nexpressly authorizes the Sewer District to undertake stormwater-control measures.\nParagraph 5(m), which governs the Sewer District’s authority with respect to\n“Local Sewerage Collection Facilities and Systems,” states that “[t]he District\nshall have authority pursuant to Chapter 6119 of the Ohio Revised Code to plan,\nfinance, construct, maintain, operate, and regulate local sewerage collection\nfacilities and systems within the District, including both storm and sanitary sewer\nsystems.” (Emphasis added.) And paragraph 5(m)(3) specifically directs the\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                               January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nSewer District to “develop a detailed integrated capital improvement plan for\nregional management of wastewater collection and storm drainage designed to\nidentify a capital improvement program for the solution of all intercommunity\ndrainage problems (both storm and sanitary) in the District.”\n       {¶ 28} Appellees, political subdivisions and property owners within the\nSewer District, argue that Title V of the Sewer District’s Code of Regulations,\nwhich sets out the regional stormwater-management program, conflicts with the\ncharter’s provision that local communities retain authority and responsibility for\nmaintaining and operating their local sewerage collection systems absent a written\nagreement placing that responsibility on the Sewer District. But Title V does not\nprovide for the Sewer District’s ownership of or responsibility for sewerage\ncollection facilities and systems owned or operated by the member communities,\nand the Sewer District asserts that it does not intend to interfere with the member\ncommunities’ local systems.\n       {¶ 29} Title V distinguishes between local stormwater systems and the\nregional stormwater system. “Regional Stormwater System” means “[t]he entire\nsystem of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and Stormwater\nControl Measures in the District’s service area that are owned and/or operated by\nthe District or over which the District has right of use for the management of\nstormwater, including both naturally occurring and constructed facilities.”\nNortheast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. Code of Regs., Section 5.0218. “Local\nStormwater System,” on the other hand, includes watercourses, stormwater-\nconveyance structures or stormwater-control measures “owned and/or operated by\na private entity or a unit of local government other than the District” and “not\ndesignated as part of the Regional Stormwater System.” Id., Section 5.0212. So,\nthe regional stormwater system does not include watercourses, conveyance\nstructures or stormwater-control measures owned or operated by the local\ncommunities absent agreement between the local communities and the Sewer\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nDistrict. By limiting the reach of the regional stormwater system, Title V does\nnot conflict with the Sewer District’s charter, and I agree with the majority that\nthe charter authorizes the Sewer District to build and operate a regional\nstormwater-management system.\n       {¶ 30} Despite my agreement with the majority’s determination that the\nSewer District has authority to manage uncontaminated stormwater, I disagree\nwith the majority’s conclusion that R.C. 6119.09 authorizes the stormwater fees\nset out in Title V. Appellees argue that the Sewer District cannot impose its\nstormwater fees for two reasons: (1) because R.C. Chapter 6119 does not\nauthorize the fees and (2) because the fees amount to an unlawful tax.\n       {¶ 31} In her dissent, Justice Kennedy adopts appellees’ second\nargument—that the charges amount to an unlawful tax. But I agree with the\nSewer District’s assertion that that issue is not properly before us. The Sewer\nDistrict asked this court to adopt a proposition of law stating that stormwater-\nmanagement charges based upon the amount of impervious surface a parcel\ncontains—like the stormwater fees here—do not constitute an illegal tax. This\ncourt, however, declined jurisdiction over that proposition of law. Northeast Ohio\nRegional Sewer Dist. v. Bath Twp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1413</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2014-Ohio-566, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Having declined jurisdiction over that proposition of law, the\nquestion whether the stormwater fees are an unlawful tax is not before the court.\n       {¶ 32} In my view, it is appellees’ other argument—regarding statutory\nauthority—that is persuasive.     The majority reasons that because a “water\nresource project” includes a facility to be acquired, constructed or operated, the\nSewer District may charge fees for that purpose under R.C. 6119.09.                 I\nrespectfully disagree.\n       {¶ 33} R.C. 6119.09 authorizes a regional water and sewer district to\n\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n       “charge, alter, and collect rentals or other charges * * * for the use\n       or services of any water resource project or any benefit conferred\n       thereby and contract * * * with one or more persons, one or more\n       political subdivisions, or any combination thereof, desiring the use\n       or services thereof, and fix the terms, conditions, rentals, or other\n       charges * * * for such use or services.”\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) See also R.C. 6119.06(W). The Sewer District contends that\nits stormwater fees represent charges for the use, services or benefits of a water-\nresource project.\n       {¶ 34} Although R.C. 6119.011(G) defines “water resource project” to\ninclude a project “to be acquired, constructed, or operated by or leased to a\nregional water and sewer district,” the district may charge only “for the use or\nservices of” or “any benefit conferred” by a water-resource project.            R.C.\n6119.09. R.C. 6119.09 contemplates uses or services that may be contracted for.\nThe question, therefore, resolves to whether a water-resource project that will be\nacquired, constructed or operated in the future affords uses, services or benefits in\nthe present, so as to authorize charges under R.C. 6119.09—a question the\nmajority does not address.\n       {¶ 35} The Eighth District concluded that the Sewer District “improperly\nemployed R.C. 6119.09 to generate revenues for the costs of its” regional\nstormwater-management program because the stormwater fees are “unrelated to\nany use or services afforded to a property owner by a ‘water resource project.’ ”\n2013-Ohio-4186, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 53, 56. Appellees likewise contend that the\nSewer District may not impose stormwater fees for a water-resource project that\nthe Sewer District has not yet acquired, constructed or operated, because until it\nhas done so, there is no use, service or benefit for which to charge.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n          {¶ 36} The Sewer District directs this court to the trial court’s factual\nfindings regarding the uses and services the regional stormwater-management\nprogram provides. The trial court found that property owners within the Sewer\nDistrict passively “ ‘use’ the unmanaged Regional Stormwater System as rainfall\ncreates runoff from each parcel.” The trial court also found that the Sewer\nDistrict provides the “service of effective transportation of stormwater,” resulting\nin decreased flooding and erosion. Finally, the court stated that the regional\nstormwater-management system will provide benefits, including improvements in\nwater quality and wildlife habitats and the reduction of future stormwater-\nmanagement costs. But those findings depend upon the Sewer District acquiring,\nconstructing, and operating a water-resource project. Whether property owners\nwould benefit in the future from the system the Sewer District intends to create\nand operate sidesteps the relevant issue: whether the Sewer District currently\noffers uses or services relating to the stormwater-management system for which it\nmay charge.\n          {¶ 37} Nothing in R.C. 6119.09 suggests that the Sewer District may\npresently impose a fee for uses or services it will be able to provide only in the\nfuture.    The statute requires current usage, service or benefits to justify the\ncollection of stormwater fees. Until the Sewer District acquires, constructs or\nbegins to operate a water-resource project relating to regional stormwater\nmanagement, it has no use, service or benefit to provide in exchange for the\nstormwater fees it seeks to extract from property owners.\n          {¶ 38} Even so, the Sewer District is not without recourse. A regional\nwater and sewer district may levy and collect taxes and special assessments and\nmay issue revenue bonds. R.C. 6119.06(I) and (J); R.C. 6119.12; R.C. 6119.18;\nR.C. 6119.42. It may receive and accept grants from federal and state agencies\nfor or in aid of the construction of water-resource projects.

In all other respects, I concur.\n                               _________________\n       KENNEDY, J., dissenting.\n       {¶ 40} Respectfully, I dissent.    I would hold that the Northeast Ohio\nRegional Sewer District (the “Sewer District”) lacks authority to manage\nstormwater as proposed in the Sewer District’s Stormwater Management Code\n(“SMC”) or to charge a fee to manage stormwater.\n                                R.C. Chapter 6119\n       {¶ 41} R.C. Chapter 6119 addresses the creation and authority of regional\nsewer districts.

I agree with appellees and the court\nof appeals that “waste water” necessarily means water containing waste.\n       {¶ 43} The majority holds that R.C. 6119.011(K) authorizes the District to\nmanage two types of water—stormwater and water that is polluted or\ncontaminated. I disagree. In my view, the definition of “waste water” is water\nthat “contain[s] sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants.”\nR.C. 6119.011(K). This conclusion is supported by the purpose of the Sewer\nDistrict, which is “to provide for collection, treatment, and disposal of waste\nwater.” (Emphasis added.) R.C. 6119.01. Therefore, because the Sewer District\nis only authorized to treat water that contains waste, it has no authority to treat\nstormwater runoff, which the SMC defines as stormwater “that flows into ditches,\nwater courses, storm sewers, or other concentrated flow patterns during and\nfollowing precipitation, including rain runoff, snowmelt runoff, and surface\nrunoff.”\n                                     The SMC\n       {¶ 44} The SMC proposes a comprehensive, broad-ranging plan to\nmanage stormwater that is beyond the Sewer District’s authority under R.C.\nChapter 6119. The Sewer District found that flooding and streambank erosion are\n“significant threats” within the District.     Consequently, the Sewer District\ndetermined that a “Regional Stormwater Management Program is necessary” to\naddress these threats and their impacts on northeast Ohio’s water resources. The\nregional stormwater-management program would include “[c]omprehensive\nmanagement     of   the   Regional   Stormwater    System,”    “construction   and\nimplementation of necessary Stormwater Control Measures to address current,\nand minimize new flooding and erosion issues affecting the Regional Stormwater\nSystem,” as well as “inspection, operation, maintenance, and monitoring\nactivities,” including but not limited to clearing debris from blocked culverts,\n\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\nbridge abutments, and repair of streambank erosion. The “Regional Stormwater\nSystem” is extensive and includes:\n\n\n                 The   entire   system   of    watercourses,   stormwater\n         conveyance structures, and Stormwater Control Measures in the\n         District’s service area that are owned and/or operated by the\n         District or over which the District has right of use for the\n         management of stormwater, including both naturally occurring\n         and constructed facilities. The Regional Stormwater System\n         shall   generally   include   those   watercourses,   stormwater\n         conveyance structures, and Stormwater Control Measures\n         receiving drainage from three hundred (300) acres of land or\n         more.\n\n\n       {¶ 45} The SMC further states that it “is applicable to activities and\npersons on all parcels within the Sewer District’s service area.” The District will\ncharge every parcel of land within the District a stormwater fee to fund the\naforementioned stormwater-control measures.\n       {¶ 46} Nowhere in Chapter 6119 is flooding or erosion control discussed.\nIn large part, the SMC seeks to manage “pure” stormwater, i.e. water resulting\nfrom precipitation that is not mixed with pollutants or contaminants and that never\nenters the sanitary sewer system. Management of this water is beyond the scope\nof the Sewer District’s authority, which is to collect, treat, and dispose of waste\nwater, which is water that contains waste, i.e., pollutants or contaminants.\nTherefore, I would hold that the Sewer District has no statutory authority to\nimplement the SMC.\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                 Stormwater “Fees”\n       {¶ 47} Initially, I will address the concurring and dissenting opinion’s\nassertion that the issue of whether a stormwater fee is a lawful tax is not properly\nbefore the court.\n       {¶ 48} Even though the reasons are not typically memorialized, this court\nmay reject one or more propositions of law or an entire discretionary appeal for\nany number of reasons.

Chapter 6119 is authorized to manage stormwater which\nis not combined with sewage, and to impose a charge for that purpose. Such a\ncharge is one ‘for the use or service of a water resource project or any benefit\nconferred thereby.’ ” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\f                                January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 51} In response to that proposition, appellee city of Beachwood argued\nin its merit brief in part that “[t]he Stormwater Fee is actually an unauthorized tax\nthat the Sewer District is using to avoid other required R.C. Chapter 6119\nrevenue-generating procedures.” Beachwood’s argument is an apt challenge to\nthe Sewer District’s assertion that the proposed charge for stormwater\nmanagement is authorized.       To prevent Beachwood from making such an\nargument based on our initial declination to consider this issue would infringe\nupon Beachwood’s ability to make arguments of its own choosing and to fully\nrespond to the Sewer District’s propositions of law that we accepted in this\nappeal. And unlike issues raised for the first time in a reply brief, where the\nopposing party has no ability to respond, Beachwood raised the unlawful tax\nargument in its merit brief, affording the Sewer District an opportunity to refute\nthe argument in its reply brief. Compare In re C.Z., 12th Dist. Warren Nos.\nCA2005-06-065, CA2005-06-066, CA2005-06-081, and CA2005-06-082, 2006-\nOhio-1787, ¶ 20 (raising a new assignment of error in a reply brief precludes the\nopposing party from responding to that argument).\n       {¶ 52} Obviously, this court may reject any argument presented by a\nparty, but this court’s refusal to review a proposition of law should not bar an\nopposing party from later using the same or a similar issue raised in that\nproposition in a legitimate, responsive argument to an opposing party’s\nproposition of law that is being considered by the court, nor should it prevent this\ncourt from relying upon such an argument. Under the facts of this case, I would\nhold that the court is justified in considering Beachwood’s responsive argument\nthat the Sewer District’s proposed fee is really an unlawful tax, even though the\ncourt declined to accept the Sewer District’s proposition of law on that issue for\nreview. Having addressed this threshold issue, I will proceed to address the\nmerits of whether the stormwater fee is an unlawful tax.\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 53} A sewer district may “charge, alter, and collect rentals or other\ncharges, including penalties for late payment, for the use or services of any water\nresource project or any benefit conferred thereby.” R.C. 6119.09; see also R.C.\n6119.06(W)(1). A “water resource project” is defined under R.C. 6119.011(G) as\n“any waste water facility or water management facility acquired, constructed, or\noperated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district or to be acquired,\nconstructed, or operated by or leased to a regional water and sewer district under\nthis chapter * * *.”\n       {¶ 54} In this case, the Sewer District, through the SMC, seeks to impose\na “stormwater fee” on parcels of land in the District to pay for the management of\nstormwater.    The fee, which is “based upon a calculation of the amount of\nImpervious Surface on a parcel[,] shall be imposed on every parcel within the\nDistrict’s service area.”\n       {¶ 55} In my view, this fee is actually a tax, which does not appear to have\nbeen lawfully imposed.

To finance this project, Lansing decided to impose a\nstormwater service charge. Similar to the instant case, the fee was based\non the amount of impervious surface that a parcel contained. The court\nstated:\n\n\n                  A proper fee must reflect the bestowal of a\n           corresponding benefit on the person paying the charge, which\n           benefit is not generally shared by other members of society.\n           Nat’l Cable Television Ass’n v.

Where the charge for either storm or\n           sanitary sewers reflects the actual costs of use, metered with\n           relative precision in accordance with available technology,\n           including some capital investment component, sewerage may\n           properly be viewed as a utility service for which usage-based\n           charges are permissible, and not as a disguised tax.\n\n\nId. at 164-165.\n          {¶ 62} But the court held that “the lack of correspondence\nbetween the [stormwater service] charges and the benefit conferred\ndemonstrates that the city has failed to differentiate any particularized\nbenefits to property owners from the general benefits conferred on the\npublic.” Id. at 166. The court continued:\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f                               January Term, 2015\n\n\n\n\n               This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the\n       acknowledged goal of the ordinance is to address environmental\n       concerns regarding water quality. Improved water quality in the\n       Grand and Red Cedar Rivers and the avoidance of federal\n       penalties for discharge violations are goals that benefit everyone\n       in the city, not only property owners.\n\n\nId.\n       {¶ 63} Pursuant to my interpretation of “waste water” above, I do not\nbelieve that the Sewer District has authority to manage stormwater; consequently,\nthe assessment fails to support a regulatory purpose, which is a factor that can\nsupport a finding that it is indeed a fee and not a tax. See Drees Co., 132 Ohio\nSt.3d 186, 2012-Ohio-2370, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at ¶ 16-20.                However, even\nassuming that the Sewer District has statutory authority to manage stormwater as\nproposed in the SMC, the purported fee fails to meet other indicia of a true fee.\n       {¶ 64} In the instant case, the Sewer District found that the SWC is\nnecessary (1) to prevent flooding to public and private property, (2) to prevent\n“[s]treambank erosion[, which] is a significant threat to public and private\nproperty, water quality, wildlife, and aquatic and terrestrial habitats,” and (3) to\nprevent “damage[ to] the water resources of Northeast Ohio, [which] impair[s] the\nability of these waters to sustain ecological and aquatic systems.”\n       {¶ 65} Despite the district’s claims that the SMC will benefit private\nproperty, I would hold that alleviating these problems results in a benefit that is\nconferred on the general public rather than on individual property owners.
