Code Ann. § 6-18-206 (“the 1989 Act”). The applications\nwere denied based on the race-related limitation in § 6-18-206(f)(1):\n\n            (f) The provisions of this section and all student choice options\n      created in this section are subject to the following limitations:\n\n               (1) No student may transfer to a nonresident district where the\n             percentage of enrollment for the student’s race exceeds that\n             percentage in the student’s resident district.\n\n(This limitation was subject to exceptions not here at issue.) The Parents commenced\nthis action against Magnet Cove School District, the Arkansas Board of Education, the\nArkansas Department of Education, and several board members (collectively, “the\nEducators”), seeking a declaratory judgment that section (f)(1) violates the Equal\nProtection Clause and an injunction transferring their children to the Magnet Cove\nSchool District. The Camden Fairview School District and the El Dorado School\nDistrict as intervenors in the district court, and the Little Rock School District as\namicus curiae on appeal, appeared to support the constitutionality of section (f)(1).\n\n      Applying the Supreme Court’s fractured decision in Parents Involved in\nCommunity Schools v. Seattle School District Number 1, 551 U.S. 701 (2007), to the\n“complicated history” of equal-opportunity education in Arkansas, the district court1\nconcluded that section (f)(1)’s racial limitation cannot survive the required strict\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Robert T. Dawson, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fscrutiny because its “blanket rule on inter-district transfers based solely on [racial]\npercentages” was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.\nHowever, applying state law, the court further concluded that section (f)(1) is not\nseverable from the remainder of the 1989 Act. Accordingly, the court declared\n§ 6-18-206 “unconstitutional in its entirety” and, for this reason, denied the Parents’\nrequest for injunctive relief transferring their children. The Parents and the Educators\ncross-appealed this ruling; the district court stayed enforcement of its judgment\npending the appeals.\n\n      After the appeals were briefed and argued, the Arkansas General Assembly\nenacted the Public School Choice Act of 2013 (“the 2013 Act”). Act 1227, 2013 Ark.\nActs 1227 (Apr. 16, 2013), codified at Ark. Code Ann. §§ 6-18-1901 et seq. The 2013\nAct repealed the 1989 Act in its entirety, replacing it with a similarly broad school\nchoice transfer option without section (f)(1)’s categorical race-based limitation. In\nproviding that the 2013 Act would be effective on the date of its approval by the\nGovernor, the General Assembly found:\n\n      that certain provisions of the Arkansas Public School Choice Act of\n      1989, § 6-18-206, have been found to be unconstitutional by a federal\n      court; that thousands of public school students are currently attending\n      public schools in nonresident school districts under that law; that there\n      is now uncertainty about the viability of those transfers and future\n      transfers; that this act repeals the disputed provisions of that law while\n      preserving the opportunity for public school choice; and that this act is\n      immediately necessary to resolve the uncertainty in the law before the\n      2013-2014 school year and preserve existing student transfers.\n\nAct 1227, § 7. We asked the parties to address whether the repeal of the challenged\nlaw moots the Parents’ lawsuit. After reviewing the parties’ supplemental briefs and\nresponses, we conclude that it does. Therefore, we vacate the decision of the district\ncourt and remand with instructions to dismiss the Parents’ complaint as moot.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       Article III of the Constitution grants federal courts the power to hear “Cases”\nand “Controversies.” This “requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial\nproceedings, trial and appellate.” Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477\n(1990). “A case becomes moot -- and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’\nfor purposes of Article III -- when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the\nparties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc.,\n133 S. Ct. 721, 726 (2013) (quotation omitted). Thus, we will dismiss as moot a case\nin which “changed circumstances [have] already provide[d] the requested relief and\neliminate[d] the need for court action.” McCarthy v. Ozark Sch. Dist., 359 F.3d 1029,\n1035 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n       In this case, the Parents sought a declaratory judgment that\nsection 6-18-206(f)(1) of the Arkansas Code violates the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and prospective injunctive relief. That statute, indeed the\nentire 1989 Act, was unconditionally repealed by the 2013 Act. “When a law has\nbeen amended or repealed, actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief for earlier\nversions are generally moot.” Phelps-Roper v. City of Manchester, 697 F.3d 678, 687\n(8th Cir. 2012) (en banc); accord Coral Springs St. Sys., Inc. v. City of Sunrise, 371\nF.3d 1320, 1329 (11th Cir. 2004), and cases cited. In their supplemental briefs, the\nEducators argue the case is moot. The Parents concede their claim for injunctive relief\nis moot but argue the 2013 Act did not entirely moot their claim for declaratory relief\nfor two distinct reasons.\n\n       First, the Parents argue that, although the 2013 Act “repeals the overt race\nprovisions of section (f)(1) . . . it carries forward the question of race in school\ntransfers in a subtle and complex way” by providing:\n\n      (b)(1) A school district annually may declare an exemption under this\n      section if the school district is subject to the desegregation order or\n      mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the effects of past racial\n      segregation.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fArk. Code Ann. § 6-18-1906(b)(1). The Parents assert that amicus Little Rock and\nintervenors El Dorado and Camden-Fairview school districts all seek that exemption,\ndemonstrating that “at that local level the legal debate recurs in almost exactly the\nsame terms as presented on the merits of this appeal.”\n\n       This feature of the 2013 Act does not make the Parents’ lawsuit any less moot\nbecause the Parents no longer have the requisite “personal stake” in the lawsuit, even\ntaking into account the new exemption process. Lewis, 494 U.S. at 478. In their\nsupplemental brief, the Parents argued that the remedy they seek in the lawsuit is not\nmoot because an injunction ordering their children transferred pursuant to their 2010\napplications would be greater relief than they could obtain under the 2013 Act. The\nEducators then submitted documents showing that the Parents applied for transfers\nunder the 2013 Act, and their applications were approved. Unlike the 1989 Act, the\n2013 Act expressly provides that “[a] transfer student attending a nonresident school\nunder this subchapter may complete all remaining school years at the nonresident\ndistrict.” § 6-18-1904(c)(1). Thus, as the Parents later conceded, the 2013 Act affords\ntheir children the full prospective relief they seek in the lawsuit. In these\ncircumstances, the claims are moot because the Parents are “no longer in need of any\nprotection from the challenged practice.” Camreta v. Greene, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 2034\n(2011). As in Coleman v. Lyng, 864 F.2d 604, 611 (8th Cir. 1988), the General\nAssembly’s “obvious intent” was that the 2013 Act would remedy the Parents’\ngrievances that prompted this case.2\n\n\n      2\n        We note that exemptions under the 2013 Act are limited to individual school\ndistricts that are subject to federal desegregation mandates, a regime totally unlike the\nstatutory race-based limitation in section (f)(1) of the 1989 Act. Under Parents\nInvolved, equal protection challenges to the 2013 Act would be subject to a very\ndifferent analysis than the district court applied in invalidating section (f)(1). See 551\nU.S. at 793-96 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Moreover, the challenges would be to\nindividual school district claims of exemption under the 2013 Act, not to a statewide\nstatutory limitation on school transfers based solely on racial factors.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f       Second, the Parents invoke the well-established principle “that a defendant’s\nvoluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its\npower to determine the legality of the practice” unless “subsequent events made it\nabsolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected\nto recur.” City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 & n.10 (1982)\n(citation omitted); see Ne. Fla. Chapter of the Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City\nof Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 661-62 (1993). By its terms, the 2013 Act expires in\n2015, § 6-18-1909, when the Arkansas General Assembly next meets in regular\nsession, see Ark. Const. art. V § 5(b). The Parents argue the 2015 expiration\nestablishes that the 2013 Act is a stop-gap; unless we rule on the merits of these\nappeals, the General Assembly will be free to return to employing race-based limits\non public school transfers when it revisits the issue in 2015.\n\n       As a general matter, we agree with the Fourth Circuit “that statutory changes\nthat discontinue a challenged practice are usually enough to render a case moot, even\nif the legislature possesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is\ndismissed.” Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Paige, 211 F.3d 112, 116 (4th Cir. 2000); see\nMcCarthy, 359 F.3d at 1036-37. “The exceptions to this general line of holdings are\nrare and typically involve situations where it is virtually certain that the repealed law\nwill be reenacted.” Native Village of Noatak v. Blatchford, 38 F.3d 1505, 1510 (9th\nCir. 1994), citing City of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at 289.\n\n      In this case, we share the Parents’ view that the 2013 Act’s expiration almost\nguarantees the General Assembly will revisit the issue of public school choice in\n2015. But we see no indication it intends to reenact a statewide, exclusively race-\nbased limitation. Indeed, all objective legislative signals are to the contrary. The\nGeneral Assembly moved toward eliminating section (f)(1) even before the district\ncourt’s ruling in this case. In 2011, the Senate passed a bill that removed\nsection (f)(1)’s racial limitation, but the General Assembly adjourned before the\nHouse of Representatives acted. See S.B. 914, 88th Gen. Ass., § 4 (Ark. 2011). In\n\n                                          -6-\n\fenacting the 2013 Act this year -- by votes of 54 to 8 in the House of Representatives\nand 32 to 1 in the Senate -- the General Assembly expressly found that the “benefits\nof enhanced quality and effectiveness in our public schools justify permitting a student\nto apply for admission to a school in any school district” provided the transfer does\nnot conflict with a court order “remedying the effects of past racial segregation in the\nschool district.” § 6-18-1901(b)(3). By rewriting the entire statute and eliminating\nall explicitly race-based limits on school transfers, the General Assembly evidenced\nan intent to move away from this constitutionally sensitive issue so as to preserve the\nbenefits of school choice. Compare Kansas Judicial Review v. Stout, 562 F.3d 1240,\n1246 (10th Cir. 2009); Zessar v. Keith, 536 F.3d 788, 794-95 (7th Cir. 2008). This\nwas not the action of a legislative body seeking to “moot a case by repealing the\nchallenged statute and replacing it with one that differs only in some insignificant\nrespect.” Associated Gen. Contractors, 508 U.S. at 662.\n\n        In enacting the 2013 Act on an emergency basis, “the legislature acted quickly\nfor the benefit of the [Parents] and other citizens of Arkansas to replace the stricken\n[Public School Choice Act] with a[ statute] it believed would pass constitutional\nmuster.” McCarthy, 359 F.3d at 1036. Without question, the General Assembly will\nneed to address these difficult issues again in 2015 if it decides to enact a new statute\nextending the perceived benefits of broadly available public school transfers. But\nthere is no reason to believe the General Assembly will simply reinstate section (f)(1)\nof the 1989 Act. Rather, as judges, we must assume the General Assembly will\nproperly perform its legislative duty by taking into account the diverse political views\nof its interested Arkansas constituents -- parents, students, educators, and others -- and\nby weighing relevant constitutional decisions such as Parents Involved, in fashioning\na new law that will then be subject to judicial review. “There is no evidence here that\nthe State intends to reenact the repealed statute, nor that any such legislative action\ncould evade review.” Epp v. Kerrey, 964 F.2d 754, 755 (8th Cir. 1992). In these\ncircumstances, the “voluntary cessation” exception to mootness does not apply\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fbecause “the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\nCity of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at 289 n.10.\n\n       For these reasons, the Parents’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are\nmoot. As is our normal practice when a case has been rendered moot by events\noutside the parties’ control, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand the\ncase with directions that it be dismissed. See United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S.\n36, 39-40 (1950). “The point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision from\nspawning any legal consequences, so that no party is harmed by what we have called\na preliminary adjudication.” Camreta, 131 S. Ct. at 2035 (quotation omitted). The\nParents argue that we should instead apply the rule “that mootness by reason of\nsettlement does not justify vacatur.” U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall\nPartnership, 513 U.S. 18, 29 (1994). This contention is without merit. See Valero,\n211 F.3d at 121.\n\n      The Memorandum Opinion and Order and the Judgment of the district court\ndated June 8, 2012, are vacated, and the case is remanded with directions to dismiss\nthe Parents’ complaint as moot.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f",

In\nproviding that the 2013 Act would be effective on the date of its approval by the\nGovernor, the General Assembly found:\n\n      that certain provisions of the Arkansas Public School Choice Act of\n      1989, § 6-18-206, have been found to be unconstitutional by a federal\n      court; that thousands of public school students are currently attending\n      public schools in nonresident school districts under that law; that there\n      is now uncertainty about the viability of those transfers and future\n      transfers; that this act repeals the disputed provisions of that law while\n      preserving the opportunity for public school choice; and that this act is\n      immediately necessary to resolve the uncertainty in the law before the\n      2013-2014 school year and preserve existing student transfers.\n\nAct 1227, § 7. We asked the parties to address whether the repeal of the challenged\nlaw moots the Parents’ lawsuit. After reviewing the parties’ supplemental briefs and\nresponses, we conclude that it does. Therefore, we vacate the decision of the district\ncourt and remand with instructions to dismiss the Parents’ complaint as moot.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       Article III of the Constitution grants federal courts the power to hear “Cases”\nand “Controversies.” This “requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial\nproceedings, trial and appellate.” Lewis v.

That statute, indeed the\nentire 1989 Act, was unconditionally repealed by the 2013 Act. “When a law has\nbeen amended or repealed, actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief for earlier\nversions are generally moot.” Phelps-Roper v.

In their supplemental briefs, the\nEducators argue the case is moot. The Parents concede their claim for injunctive relief\nis moot but argue the 2013 Act did not entirely moot their claim for declaratory relief\nfor two distinct reasons.\n\n       First, the Parents argue that, although the 2013 Act “repeals the overt race\nprovisions of section (f)(1) . . . it carries forward the question of race in school\ntransfers in a subtle and complex way” by providing:\n\n      (b)(1) A school district annually may declare an exemption under this\n      section if the school district is subject to the desegregation order or\n      mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the effects of past racial\n      segregation.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fArk. Code Ann. § 6-18-1906(b)(1). The Parents assert that amicus Little Rock and\nintervenors El Dorado and Camden-Fairview school districts all seek that exemption,\ndemonstrating that “at that local level the legal debate recurs in almost exactly the\nsame terms as presented on the merits of this appeal.”\n\n       This feature of the 2013 Act does not make the Parents’ lawsuit any less moot\nbecause the Parents no longer have the requisite “personal stake” in the lawsuit, even\ntaking into account the new exemption process. Lewis, 494 U.S. at 478. In their\nsupplemental brief, the Parents argued that the remedy they seek in the lawsuit is not\nmoot because an injunction ordering their children transferred pursuant to their 2010\napplications would be greater relief than they could obtain under the 2013 Act. The\nEducators then submitted documents showing that the Parents applied for transfers\nunder the 2013 Act, and their applications were approved. Unlike the 1989 Act, the\n2013 Act expressly provides that “[a] transfer student attending a nonresident school\nunder this subchapter may complete all remaining school years at the nonresident\ndistrict.” § 6-18-1904(c)(1). Thus, as the Parents later conceded, the 2013 Act affords\ntheir children the full prospective relief they seek in the lawsuit. In these\ncircumstances, the claims are moot because the Parents are “no longer in need of any\nprotection from the challenged practice.” Camreta v. Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217512\"><a href=\"/opinion/217512/camreta-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2020</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2034\n(2011). As in Coleman v. Lyng, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 611 (8th Cir. 1988), the General\nAssembly’s “obvious intent” was that the 2013 Act would remedy the Parents’\ngrievances that prompted this case.2\n\n\n      2\n        We note that exemptions under the 2013 Act are limited to individual school\ndistricts that are subject to federal desegregation mandates, a regime totally unlike the\nstatutory race-based limitation in section (f)(1) of the 1989 Act. Under Parents\nInvolved, equal protection challenges to the 2013 Act would be subject to a very\ndifferent analysis than the district court applied in invalidating section (f)(1). See 551\nU.S. at 793-96 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Moreover, the challenges would be to\nindividual school district claims of exemption under the 2013 Act, not to a statewide\nstatutory limitation on school transfers based solely on racial factors.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f       Second, the Parents invoke the well-established principle “that a defendant’s\nvoluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its\npower to determine the legality of the practice” unless “subsequent events made it\nabsolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected\nto recur.” City of Mesquite v.

By its terms, the 2013 Act expires in\n2015, § 6-18-1909, when the Arkansas General Assembly next meets in regular\nsession, see Ark. Const. art. V § 5(b). The Parents argue the 2015 expiration\nestablishes that the 2013 Act is a stop-gap; unless we rule on the merits of these\nappeals, the General Assembly will be free to return to employing race-based limits\non public school transfers when it revisits the issue in 2015.\n\n       As a general matter, we agree with the Fourth Circuit “that statutory changes\nthat discontinue a challenged practice are usually enough to render a case moot, even\nif the legislature possesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is\ndismissed.” Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Paige, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768563\"><a href=\"/opinion/768563/valero-terrestrial-corporation-lackawanna-transport-company-solid-waste/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116 (4th Cir. 2000); see\nMcCarthy, 359 F.3d at 1036-37. “The exceptions to this general line of holdings are\nrare and typically involve situations where it is virtually certain that the repealed law\nwill be reenacted.” Native Village of Noatak v. Blatchford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681319\"><a href=\"/opinion/681319/native-village-of-noatak-v-edgar-blatchford-as-commissioner-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1505</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1510 (9th\nCir. 1994), citing City of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at 289.\n\n      In this case, we share the Parents’ view that the 2013 Act’s expiration almost\nguarantees the General Assembly will revisit the issue of public school choice in\n2015. But we see no indication it intends to reenact a statewide, exclusively race-\nbased limitation. Indeed, all objective legislative signals are to the contrary. The\nGeneral Assembly moved toward eliminating section (f)(1) even before the district\ncourt’s ruling in this case. In 2011, the Senate passed a bill that removed\nsection (f)(1)’s racial limitation, but the General Assembly adjourned before the\nHouse of Representatives acted. See S.B. 914, 88th Gen. Ass., § 4 (Ark. 2011). In\n\n                                          -6-\n\fenacting the 2013 Act this year -- by votes of 54 to 8 in the House of Representatives\nand 32 to 1 in the Senate -- the General Assembly expressly found that the “benefits\nof enhanced quality and effectiveness in our public schools justify permitting a student\nto apply for admission to a school in any school district” provided the transfer does\nnot conflict with a court order “remedying the effects of past racial segregation in the\nschool district.” § 6-18-1901(b)(3). By rewriting the entire statute and eliminating\nall explicitly race-based limits on school transfers, the General Assembly evidenced\nan intent to move away from this constitutionally sensitive issue so as to preserve the\nbenefits of school choice. Compare Kansas Judicial Review v. Stout, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172050\"><a href=\"/opinion/172050/kansas-judicial-review-v-stout/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1246 (10th Cir. 2009); Zessar v. Keith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1401560\"><a href=\"/opinion/1401560/zessar-v-keith/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794-95 (7th Cir. 2008). This\nwas not the action of a legislative body seeking to “moot a case by repealing the\nchallenged statute and replacing it with one that differs only in some insignificant\nrespect.” Associated Gen. Contractors, 508 U.S. at 662.\n\n        In enacting the 2013 Act on an emergency basis, “the legislature acted quickly\nfor the benefit of the [Parents] and other citizens of Arkansas to replace the stricken\n[Public School Choice Act] with a[ statute] it believed would pass constitutional\nmuster.” McCarthy, 359 F.3d at 1036. Without question, the General Assembly will\nneed to address these difficult issues again in 2015 if it decides to enact a new statute\nextending the perceived benefits of broadly available public school transfers. But\nthere is no reason to believe the General Assembly will simply reinstate section (f)(1)\nof the 1989 Act. Rather, as judges, we must assume the General Assembly will\nproperly perform its legislative duty by taking into account the diverse political views\nof its interested Arkansas constituents -- parents, students, educators, and others -- and\nby weighing relevant constitutional decisions such as Parents Involved, in fashioning\na new law that will then be subject to judicial review. “There is no evidence here that\nthe State intends to reenact the repealed statute, nor that any such legislative action\ncould evade review.” Epp v. Kerrey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583680\"><a href=\"/opinion/583680/m-john-epp-md-jane-doe-i-by-her-next-friend-kathryn-d-levy-jane-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755 (8th Cir. 1992). In these\ncircumstances, the “voluntary cessation” exception to mootness does not apply\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fbecause “the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\nCity of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at 289 n.10.\n\n       For these reasons, the Parents’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are\nmoot. As is our normal practice when a case has been rendered moot by events\noutside the parties’ control, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand the\ncase with directions that it be dismissed. See United States v. Munsingwear, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104822\"><a href=\"/opinion/104822/united-states-v-munsingwear-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39-40 (1950). “The point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision from\nspawning any legal consequences, so that no party is harmed by what we have called\na preliminary adjudication.” Camreta, 131 S. Ct. at 2035 (quotation omitted). The\nParents argue that we should instead apply the rule “that mootness by reason of\nsettlement does not justify vacatur.” U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall\nPartnership, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (1994). This contention is without merit. See Valero,\n211 F.3d at 121.\n\n      The Memorandum Opinion and Order and the Judgment of the district court\ndated June 8, 2012, are vacated, and the case is remanded with directions to dismiss\nthe Parents’ complaint as moot.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f</pre>",
