This is a review of an\nunpublished decision of the court of appeals affirming an order\n\nof the circuit court for Outagamie County, Michael W. Gage,\n\nJudge.1      In a certiorari review, the circuit court affirmed the\n\nTown of Black Creek Board of Review's assessment of taxpayer\n\nFrank J.

We affirm the decision of the court of\n\nappeals.\n\n     ¶2      The    issue   presented     is    whether      the    town   board     of\n\nreview     erred    in   refusing    to       lower    the    assessment       of   the\n\ntaxpayer's real property.           The town assessor valued the property\n\nat $27,500, classified the property as \"productive forest land,\"\n\nand assessed the property at $27,500.                      The taxpayer does not\n\nchallenge     the    assessor's     valuation         of    the    property.        The\n\ntaxpayer     challenges     the   assessment          on   the    ground   that     the\n\nassessor's classification of the property is erroneous.\n\n     ¶3      The assessor's classification of the property directly\n\naffects the assessment in the present case:                   Property classified\n\nas \"productive forest land\" under Wis. Stat. § 70.32(2)(a) and\n\n(c)2. (2011-12)3 is assessed at full value; property classified\n\nas \"undeveloped land\" is assessed at 50 percent of its full\n\nvalue.4     The taxpayer claims that the board should change the\n     2\n       Wis. Stat. § 70.47(13) (\"Except as provided in this\nsubsection and in ss. 70.85 and 74.37, appeal from the\ndetermination of the board of review shall be by an action for\ncertiorari . . . .\").\n     3\n       All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to\nthe 2011-2012 version unless otherwise noted.\n     4\n       Wis.

Stat.\n\n§ 70.47(13),    which     provides        that   an    \"appeal       from     the\n\ndetermination of the board of review shall be for an action for\n\ncertiorari . . . .\"5      Accordingly, this court's review of the\n\n\n\n     The Manual is relevant to our discussion because the\nlegislature   has  instructed  that   the  Manual   sets  forth\n\"guidelines\" and is published by the Department of Revenue to\n\"discuss and illustrate accepted assessment methods, techniques\nand practices with a view to more nearly uniform and more\nconsistent assessments of property at the local level.\"    Wis.\nStat. § 73.03(2a).\n\n     The Manual is cited for its persuasive value; it cannot\nsupersede the statute.\n     5\n       A taxpayer       may   challenge     an   assessment      under      other\nstatutes.\n\n     Section 70.85 allows a taxpayer to challenge an assessment\nby filing with the Department of Revenue.         \"Appeal of a\ndetermination of the department of revenue shall be by an action\nfor certiorari in the circuit court . . . .\"         Wis. Stat.\n§ 70.85(4)(c).\n\n     Section 74.37 governs a taxpayer's claim in court to\nrecover a general property tax imposed because the assessment of\nproperty was excessive.       The court proceeding is not a\ncertiorari review; it is a de novo proceeding. In a Wis. Stat.\n§ 74.37 court proceeding, \"the assessor's assessment is presumed\ncorrect if the challenging party does not present significant\ncontrary evidence.\"    Bloomer Housing Ltd. P'ship v.

This court\n\nreviews a decision of the board of review in the same manner as\n\nthe circuit court and court of appeals, benefiting from their\n\nanalyses.          Waste Mgmt. of Wis., Inc. v.

Bd. of\n\nReview, 184 Wis. 2d 541, 554, 516 N.W.2d 695 (1994).\n\n      ¶6      In    a    certiorari       review,    the    court    is    confined     to\n\ndetermining whether the board's actions were:\n\n      (1)     within its jurisdiction;\n\n      (2)     according to law;\n\n      (3)     arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable and represented\n\n              its will and not its judgment; and\n\n      (4)     supported      by    evidence       such      that    the    board     might\n\n              reasonably         make     the     order      or    determination        in\n\n              question.6\n\n      ¶7      The taxpayer's argument in the present case centers on\n\nthe fourth element of certiorari review, namely that the board's\n\ndetermination        to    adopt    the    assessor's       classification         of   the\n\nproperty is not supported by evidence such that the board might\n\nreasonably make the determination in question.\n\n\n      6\n       State ex rel.

The taxpayer asks the court to remand the matter\n\nto the board so that it can determine the correct assessment\n\nwithout     imposing      on     the    taxpayer         the     burden      of        proving   the\n\nclassification erroneous.\n\n      ¶9     The     statutes          do    not       state      whether         the     taxpayer\n\nchallenging an assessment (or classification) has the burden of\n\nproving     at      the    board        hearing          that      the       assessment          (or\n\nclassification) is incorrect.\n\n      ¶10    Upon    considering            the       general    rule       of    law    regarding\n\nburden of proof, the statutes, and the case law, we conclude\n\nthat the taxpayer challenging an assessment and classification\n\nhas   the    burden       of   proving           at    the     board     hearing         that    the\n\nassessment and classification of property are erroneous; that\n\nthe taxpayer did not meet his burden of proof; and that the\n\nboard's determination to maintain the assessment is supported by\n\na reasonable view of the evidence.                              We therefore affirm the\n\ndecision of the court of appeals.\n\n      ¶11    The following facts are not in dispute for purposes of\nthis review.        Frank Sausen, the taxpayer, owned a 10-acre plot\n\n                                                  5\n\f                                                                 No.     2010AP3015\n\n\n\nof property at W5930 County Road A, parcel number 010064400, in\n\nthe Town of Black Creek, Outagamie County, Wisconsin.                     He used\n\nthe property for occasional hunting.            The property has not been\n\nused to produce commercial forest products.\n\n       ¶12     In early November 2009, the taxpayer was notified that\n\nthe assessment of his property had increased from $11,000 in\n\n2008 to $27,500 in 2009.           The increase in assessment in 2009\n\nresulted from an increase in the assessor's valuation of the\n\nproperty, not a change in classification.7\n\n       ¶13     Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 70.32, the 2009 assessment\n\nroll       included   the   assessor's   valuation    of   the     property      at\n\n$27,500 as well as the assessor's classification of the property\n\nas \"low grade woods.\"\n\n       ¶14     According to the Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual,\n\n\"low grade woods\" is a permissible subset of \"productive forest\n\nland.\"8        \"Productive    forest   land\"   is   defined   in       Wis.   Stat.\n\n\n       7\n       The assessment notice sent to the taxpayer states that the\n\"reason for change\" was \"[i]ncrease due to revaluation.\"     Town\nof Black Creek Board of Review, Notice of Assessment——Frank\nSausen, W5930 County Rd A, Black Creek WI 54106 (Nov. 4, 2009).\nAdditionally, the prior assessment of $11,000 is congruent with\nthe prior Town of Black Creek Land Values, which valued low-\ngrade forest at $1,100 per acre. The 2009 Town of Black Creek\nLand Values valued low-grade forest at $2,750 per acre.\n       8\n       Within the classification of \"productive forest land,\" as\nprovided by Wis. Stat. § 70.32(2)(c)2., the Wisconsin Property\nAssessment   Manual   advises   assessors   to  further   create\nsubclassifications of productive forest land based on the\nspecies, size, volume, and stocking density of trees on the\nproperty.

The statute places a burden on a taxpayer who\n\nobjects     to    a    valuation    to    present       evidence   to    the   board    in\n\nsupport of the objection.                 This provision adopts the general\n\nrule placing the burden of proof on the taxpayer to put on an\n\naffirmative case in his or her favor before the board:\n\n      Wis.     Stat.     § 70.47(7)(a)     Objections     to\n      valuations. . . . No person shall be allowed in any\n      action or proceedings to question the amount16 or\n      valuation of property unless such written objection\n      has been filed and such person in good faith presented\n      evidence to such board in support of such objections\n      and made full disclosure before said board, under oath\n      of all of that person's property liable to assessment\n      in such district and the value thereof (footnote\n      added).\n      ¶23    We       acknowledge        that     the     title    of     Wis.    Stat.\n\n§ 70.47(7)(a)         is   \"Objections      to    valuations\"      and    that   (7)(a)\n\naddresses a taxpayer's objection to a valuation.                         Nevertheless,\n\nseveral subsections of § 70.47(7) refer to and govern challenges\n\nto assessments. It is apparent from reading § 70.47(7) in its\n\nentirety that the words \"valuation\" and \"assessment\" are being\n\nused interchangeably in several instances.\n\n      ¶24    Section 70.47 is a long statute with many subsections.\n\nThe   section         is   entitled      \"Board   of     review    proceedings\"        and\n\naddresses board proceedings that involve both objections to the\n\n      16\n       The word \"amount\" has been interpreted to refer to the\namount of property, that is, part or all of the property.

Nothing          in\n\n§ 70.47(7) specifically addresses a board's proceedings when an\n\nobjection is made to a classification of property.                               Because an\n\nassessment involves a classification as well as a valuation, it\n\nmakes    sense          to     treat    § 70.47(7)      as     governing         a    board's\n\nproceedings             regarding         challenges          to     the         valuation,\n\nclassification,              or    assessment       unless    the    substance          of     a\n\nprovision requires a different approach.                        There is no apparent\n\nreason to treat the taxpayer's burden of proof in a challenge to\n\nclassification differently from the taxpayer's burden of proof\n\nin a challenge to a valuation or an assessment.\n\n       ¶25    Furthermore, Wis. Stat. § 70.47(8) governing a hearing\n\nbefore the board \"in relation to the assessment\" informs our\n\ndecision about the taxpayer's burden of proof on the issue of\n\nclassification.              Section 70.47(8)(b) provides that the taxpayer\n\nshall be heard first at the board hearing.                          The party with the\n\nburden       of    proof          ordinarily    presents      first.         Because         an\n\nassessment is based on the classification, this provision in\n\n§ 70.47(8) applying to a challenge to an assessment should be\n\nread to apply to an objection to a classification.\n\n       ¶26    In addition, § 70.47(8)(i) explicitly provides that a\n\nboard shall presume that the assessor's valuation is correct but\n\nthat the presumption may be rebutted by a sufficient showing by\n\nthe    objector         that      the   valuation     is     incorrect.          Again       the\n\nstatutory language is limited to valuations and is silent about\na     presumption            of     correctness       regarding        the       assessor's\n\n                                               11\n\f                                                                  No.    2010AP3015\n\n\n\nclassification:       \"The board shall presume that the assessor's\n\nvaluation is correct.

Stat. § 70.47(8)(i).\n\n    ¶27     This    presumption      language    was    added    to   Wis.   Stat.\n\n§ 70.47(8)(i) in 1997.17          Although the presumption language in\n\nWis. Stat. § 70.47(8)(i) limits the presumption of correctness\n\nto the assessor's valuation, we must read § 70.47(8)(i) in the\n\ncontext of the contemporaneous amendment adding                    § 70.47(8)(h)\n\nrequiring     the   assessor    to    \"provide     to     the    board   specific\n\ninformation     about    the   validity     of     the     valuation . . . and\n\ninformation that the assessor used to determine that valuation.\"\n\nThe presumption in § 70.47(8)(i) reinforces the burden of proof\n\nimposed in § 70.47(7) on the taxpayer who objects to valuation\n\nto show at the board hearing that the valuation is erroneous.\n\nEven though the assessor must provide specific information to\n\nthe board regarding the valuation, the burden of proof to show\n\nerror in the assessor's valuation remains on the taxpayer.\n\n    ¶28     Our interpretation of Wis. Stat. § 70.47(7) and (8) to\n\nsupport imposing the burden of proof on the taxpayer challenging\n\nthe assessment or classification at the board is reinforced by\n\n§ 70.47(9), which directs the board how and when to correct an\n\nassessment.     Section 70.47(9) provides that a board shall raise\n\nor lower an assessment \"if the assessment is too high or too\n\nlow\" and \"shall state on the record the correct assessment and\n\n    17\n         1997 Wis.

Stat. § 70.47(9)(a).\n\n       ¶29       Although      Wis.    Stat.     § 70.47(9)(a)         is      silent      about\n\nwhether the taxpayer has the burden of proof in challenging the\n\ncorrectness        of    the     classification,           Wis.   Stat.        § 70.47(9)(a)\n\nexplicitly states that if the vote at the board is a tie vote on\n\nthe     objection        to    the     assessment,         the    assessment         will     be\n\nsustained.         The legislature has thus declared that if the party\n\nwho seeks to raise or lower the assessment fails to persuade a\n\nmajority of the board that the assessment is incorrect, that\n\nparty loses.            In this way, § 70.47(9)(a) makes it absolutely\n\nclear that the burden of persuasion is on the taxpayer to show\n\nthat     an      assessor's         assessment       is    erroneous.            Because      an\n\nassessment depends on a valuation and a classification, it makes\n\nsense       to   apply     the      same   burden     of    proof    to      a      taxpayer's\n\nchallenge to a classification as is applied to a taxpayer's\n\nchallenge to an assessment.\n\n       ¶30       Finally,      our    position       is    supported      by     Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 74.37.           Under      this     statute,      when    a    taxpayer          uses    this\n\nprocedure         in    circuit       court    to    challenge      an      assessment       as\n\nexcessive, the circuit court reviews the board's determination\n\nde     novo,      giving      \"no     deference       to    the    Board       of     Review's\n\ndecision.\"18            Nevertheless,         \"the    underlying       assessment          still\n\n\n\n       18\n       Metro.

Rather, the taxpayer\n\ncontended that his property was improperly classified.1\n\n     ¶54    In my view, the taxpayer would have been in a stronger\n\nposition with the board if the assessor had reclassified the\n\nproperty    and   the    resulting     reclassification    had       produced   a\n\nhigher assessment.        In that case, the taxpayer could at least\n\npoint to the classification prior to the change to support his\n\nposition.    Here, it was the taxpayer, not the assessor, who was\n\nseeking to reclassify the property.          Surely the taxpayer had the\n\nburden in these circumstances.\n\n     ¶55    This court does not know when the taxpayer's property\n\nwas first classified as \"productive forest land\" because that\n\nevidence was never offered.

Finally, this\n\njustice would have liked information on whether environmental\n\nlaw prevents the harvesting of trees from officially designated\n\nwetlands   so    that       the    forested        land    was    not    able    to    produce\n\n\"commercial forest products.\"                  On certiorari review, of course,\n\nthis court is not able to consider information that was not part\nof the record of proceedings before the Board.\n\n    ¶57    In        sum,    the    taxpayer         failed      to     offer     sufficient\n\nevidence        to      establish          that           his      property           required\n\nreclassification.

First, Article VIII, § 1 of the\n\nWisconsin    Constitution——the        so-called    uniformity         clause——was\n\namended in 1927.         This constitutional provision had read in\n\npart, \"The rule of taxation shall be uniform, and taxes shall be\n\nlevied upon such property as the legislature shall prescribe.\"\n\nWis. Const. art. VIII, § 1 (amended 1927).               The 1927 amendment\n\nchanged this sentence to read, \"The rule of taxation shall be\n\nuniform, and taxes shall be levied upon such property with such\n\nclassifications     as     to   forests     and   minerals,         including   or\n\nseparate or severed from the land, as the legislature shall\n\nprescribe.\"3\n\n     ¶64    Second, the legislature followed up the 1927 amendment\n\nby creating Chapter 77 of the statutes relating to forest crop\n\nlands.     Ch. 454, Laws of 1927.          The original law permitted the\n\nowner of a tract of land that was at least 160 acres to petition\n\n     3\n       Wis. Const. art. VIII, § 1 (amended 1941) (emphasis\nadded).   In the 1941 amendment, the language changed slightly\nbut remained largely the same:\n\n          The rule of taxation shall be uniform but the\n     legislature may empower cities, villages or towns to\n     collect and return taxes on real estate located\n     therein by optional methods. Taxes shall be levied\n     upon such property with such classifications as to\n     forests and minerals including or separate or severed\n     from the land, as the legislature shall prescribe.\n\nWis. Const. art. VIII, § 1.\n\n     In   1974  the   people   approved  another   constitutional\namendment adding the following sentence to Article VIII, § 1:\n\"Taxation of agricultural land and undeveloped land, both as\ndefined by law, need not be uniform with the taxation of each\nother nor with the taxation of other real property.\"\n\n                                       6\n\f                                                                        No.    2010AP3015.dtp\n\n\nthe \"conservation commission\" to designate the land as \"forest\n\ncrop land,\" \"more useful for growing timber and other forest\n\ncrops       than    for    any   other   purpose.\"              Wis.   Stat.       § 77.02(1)\n\n(1927).        Approval of the petition by the commission subjected\n\nthe     property      to     certain     \"forestry\"         practices         as    well      as\n\nsubstantial         tax    benefits.      See      generally       Wis.    Stat.        ch.    77\n\n(1927).       The constitutional amendment contemplated that at least\n\nsome       forest   land    would   be   classified         differently         from     other\n\nland,4 but it did not require that all forest land be classified\n\ndifferently.\n\n       ¶65     Third,      the   legislature       was     in    the   midst       of   giving\n\nmunicipalities extensive planning and zoning authority.                                    See,\n\nfor example, Wis. Stat. § 59.97 (1929), setting out the \"zoning\n\npower\" of counties, which read in part, \"(1) The county board of\n\nany county may by ordinance regulate, restrict and determine the\n\nareas within which agriculture, forestry and recreation may be\n\nconducted,          the    location      of       roads,        schools,       trades         and\n\nindustries, and the location of buildings designed for specified\nuses . . . .\"5            Zoning and the classification of property for\n       4\n       The \"Woodland Tax Law,\" set out in Wis. Stat. § 77.16, was\nnot created until 1953.    See § 2, ch. 384, Laws of 1953.    The\nWoodland Tax Law stated that \"the owner of any tract of land of\nless than 40 acres may file with the conservation director an\napplication setting forth a description of the property which he\ndesires to place under the woodland tax law and on which land he\nwill practice forestry.\"     Id.   If the conservation director\ndetermined that the land was suitable for growing trees of\ncommercial quality, the application would be approved. Id. The\nwoodland would then be taxed at 20 cents per acre, and the owner\nwould be obligated to \"promote the growth of trees.\" Id.\n       5\n       See also chs. 279 and 356, Laws of 1929; ch. 375, Laws of\n1927; ch. 388, Laws of 1923.\n                                              7\n\f                                                       No.   2010AP3015.dtp\n\n\ntaxation appear to overlap, even if that overlap may not be\n\nwholly consistent.\n\n    ¶66    The 1931 legislature6 repealed the existing Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 70.32(2) and replaced it with the following:\n\n         (2) The assessor, having fixed a value, shall\n    enter the same opposite the proper tract or lot in the\n    assessment roll, following the instructions prescribed\n    therein.   In cities and villages, he shall segregate\n    into the following classes on the basis of use and set\n    down separately in proper columns the values of the\n    land, exclusive of improvements, and the improvements\n    in each class:\n\n           A.

He   claimed    that        his   property          had     been     incorrectly\n\nclassified as \"productive forest land.\"                           He asserted that the\n\ncorrect     property     classification                was   \"undeveloped         land,\"       as\n\ndefined     in   Wis.    Stat.    § 70.32(2)(c)4.,              which         would    then    be\n\nassessed at 50 percent of its value pursuant to § 70.32(4).                                   The\n\nboard of review denied his request to reclassify his property,\n\nthereby affirming the $27,500 valuation for his assessment.\n      ¶84    Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 70.47(13), Sausen petitioned\n\nfor a writ of certiorari in regard to the board of review's\n\nclassification      of   his     property         as     \"productive          forest    land.\"1\n\n\n\n      1\n       If he had paid the taxes assessed, Sausen could have\nappealed the assessment pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 74.37(3)(d)\nwherein he would have commenced an independent action in circuit\ncourt subsequent to the board of review's decision. See Nankin\nv. Vill. of Shorewood, 2001 WI 92, ¶3, 245 Wis. 2d 86, 630\nN.W.2d 141 (explaining that with real property located outside\nMilwaukee County, a property owner could employ § 74.37(3)(d) to\nrecover taxes paid on an excessive assessment).\n\n                                              1\n\f                                                                      No.    2010AP3015.pdr\n\n\nUpon certiorari review, the circuit court affirmed the board of\n\nreview.    The court of appeals affirmed as well.2\n\n                                 II.    DISCUSSION\n\n                           A.

Wis. Stat. § 70.32(4).          The board of\n\nreview    has   statutory    authority   to   review   and     evaluate    the\n\nassessor's decision and other evidence submitted to it when an\n\nobjection is made.          Wis. Stat. § 70.47(7).      Accordingly, the\n\ndecision of the board of review was within its jurisdiction.\n\nSee Anic v. Bd. of Review of the Town of Wilson, 2008 WI App 71,\n\n¶19, 311 Wis. 2d 701, 751 N.W.2d 870 (explaining that the board\n\nof review kept within its jurisdiction when it determined the\n\n\"probity and credibility of the witnesses\").\n\n      ¶88   In order for the board of review's decision to be made\n\naccording to law, the board's denial of Sausen's objections to\n\nthe assessment of his property would have involved consideration\n\nof   whether    appropriate    statutory   criteria    were     followed    in\narriving at the assessment.        Johnson v. City of Greenfield Bd.\n\nof Review, 2005 WI App 156, ¶6, 284 Wis. 2d 805, 702 N.W.2d 460.\n\nThe assessment includes the valuation of the real estate, as\n\nwell as its classification.        Wis. Stat. § 70.32.         Valuation is\n\ngoverned by § 70.32(1), (1g) and (1m).            Section § 70.32(1) is\n\n\n\n      3\n       Under Wis. Stat. § 74.37(3)(d), the action proceeds as do\nother civil actions.    Nankin, 245 Wis. 2d 86, ¶22.     Such an\naction permits a full trial on the assessment, unlike the\nlimited review accorded in certiorari review.

It\n\nprovides that valuation shall proceed:\n\n       in the manner specified in the Wisconsin property\n       assessment manual provided under s. 73.03(2a) from\n       actual view or from the best information that the\n       assessor can practicably obtain, at the full value\n       which could ordinarily be obtained therefor at private\n       sale.   In determining the value, the assessor shall\n       consider recent arm's–length sales of the property to\n       be assessed if according to professionally acceptable\n       appraisal practices those sales conform to recent\n       arm's—length sales of reasonably comparable property;\n       . . .    and   all   factors    that,   according   to\n       professionally acceptable appraisal practices, affect\n       the value of the property to be assessed.\n       ¶89    The   board     of    review         considered       recent    arm's—length\n\nsales    of   other     property        that       were    reasonably     comparable     to\n\nSausen's property.            The board noted, \"We have wood swampland\n\nthat was sold in the township parcel number 260 that was sold\n\nfor $2,750 per acre and also section 13 parcel 249 was also sold\n\nfor $2,750, they are very similar, similar type of woods on the\n\nmap.\"\n\n       ¶90    Sausen's parcel contained ten acres.                      With a per acre\n\nvalue of $2,750, the assessed value of $27,500 is consistent\n\nwith other comparable property that had a recent sale.\n\n       ¶91    The board of review also considered Sausen's argument\n\nthat the property should be classified as \"undeveloped land\" and\n\ndecided that the assessor's description of low grade woods was\n\nmore    appropriate         due    to   all        the     trees.      \"Forested      areas\n\nprimarily       held   for    hunting\"         are    generally       given    a   forested\n\nclassification such as \"[p]roductive forest land\" described in\nWis.    Stat.    § 70.32(2)(c)2.           See       Wisconsin       Dep't    of   Revenue,\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                                                     No.    2010AP3015.pdr\n\n\nWisconsin Property Assessment Manual 2013, 5-55 – 5-56 (rev'd\n\n12/11).      The board of review then affirmed the classification of\n\n\"productive forest land\" and the valuation of $27,500 given by\n\nthe assessor.        In so doing, the board of review followed the\n\ndirective     of    § 70.32(1)        and    acted     \"according     to    law.\"        See\n\nJohnson, 284 Wis. 2d 805, ¶6 (explaining that assessments made\n\naccording the statutory criteria are made according to the law).\n\n       ¶92   The    board        of   review      did     not     approach        Sausen's\n\nobjection to the classification of his property in an arbitrary,\n\noppressive or unreasonable manner.                   It excluded no evidence that\n\nSausen sought to present.                Rather, it considered the maps that\n\nhe     submitted,     his    argument         that      his     property        should    be\n\nclassified as \"undeveloped land,\" other wooded hunting lands and\n\nhow they were assessed, and the assessor's professional opinion\n\nthat the property was correctly classified as \"productive forest\n\nland\"    because    it   contained          low   grade    woods.         See    Whitecaps\n\nHomes, Inc. v. Kenosha Cnty. Bd. of Review, 212 Wis. 2d 714,\n\n722-23, 569 N.W.2d 714 (Ct. App. 1997) (concluding that so long\nas there is a reasonable ground for the exercise of the board of\n\nreview's     judgment,      it    will      not   be    held    to   be    arbitrary      or\n\noppressive).\n\n       ¶93   Sausen provided two maps as evidence:                         one from the\n\nWisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR map) and one from\n\nthe United States Department of the Interior Geological Survey\n\n(US Survey map).         Both maps are aerial photographs of Sausen's\n\nproperty, and both maps described the property in ways other\nthan    as    \"productive        forest       land,\"      the    classification          the\n\n                                             5\n\f                                                                           No.    2010AP3015.pdr\n\n\nassessor assigned to Sausen's property.                            However, neither map\n\ndescribed the land depicted as \"undeveloped land.\"                                The DNR map\n\ndescribed the property as \"forested\" and \"wetlands.\"                                      The US\n\nSurvey       map    does    not    use        descriptive          labels        for     Sausen's\n\nproperty.\n\n       ¶94     Sausen represented himself before the board of review\n\nand argued that the descriptions on the two maps confirmed his\n\nbelief       that    his    property          should     have      been     classified          as\n\n\"undeveloped         land.\"       However,          Sausen   did     not    provide        expert\n\ntestimony from a real estate appraiser who may have been able to\n\nlink     the        descriptions         on     the      maps       to      the        statutory\n\nclassifications set out in Wis. Stat. § 70.32(2)(a)5. and 6.\n\nSausen       did    not    have    the    expertise          to     make     the       necessary\n\nconnection.           Accordingly,        the        assessor's       opinion          that     the\n\nproperty was correctly classified as \"productive forest land\"\n\npursuant to § 70.32(2)(a)6. was uncontroverted before the board\n\nof review.          Therefore, the evidence was such that the board of\n\nreview might reasonably make the determination that it made.\nSee Stupar River, 336 Wis. 2d 562, ¶¶25-27 (concluding that the\n\nboard of review's decision must be upheld if it is reasonable\n\nunder the evidence submitted).\n\n                                   III.       CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶95     Certiorari review of the board of review's decision\n\nshows    that       the   board:     kept       within       its    jurisdiction;             acted\n\naccording to law; was not arbitrary, oppressive or unreasonable\n\nin   its     decision-making;        and        heard    evidence          that        reasonably\nsupported its decision.

The town assessor valued the property\n\nat $27,500, classified the property as \"productive forest land,\"\n\nand assessed the property at $27,500.                      The taxpayer does not\n\nchallenge     the    assessor's     valuation         of    the    property.        The\n\ntaxpayer     challenges     the   assessment          on   the    ground   that     the\n\nassessor's classification of the property is erroneous.\n\n     ¶3      The assessor's classification of the property directly\n\naffects the assessment in the present case:                   Property classified\n\nas \"productive forest land\" under Wis. Stat. § 70.32(2)(a) and\n\n(c)2. (2011-12)3 is assessed at full value; property classified\n\nas \"undeveloped land\" is assessed at 50 percent of its full\n\nvalue.4     The taxpayer claims that the board should change the\n     2\n       Wis.

The increase in assessment in 2009\n\nresulted from an increase in the assessor's valuation of the\n\nproperty, not a change in classification.7\n\n       ¶13     Pursuant to Wis.

The statute places a burden on a taxpayer who\n\nobjects     to    a    valuation    to    present       evidence   to    the   board    in\n\nsupport of the objection.                 This provision adopts the general\n\nrule placing the burden of proof on the taxpayer to put on an\n\naffirmative case in his or her favor before the board:\n\n      Wis.     Stat.     § 70.47(7)(a)     Objections     to\n      valuations. . . . No person shall be allowed in any\n      action or proceedings to question the amount16 or\n      valuation of property unless such written objection\n      has been filed and such person in good faith presented\n      evidence to such board in support of such objections\n      and made full disclosure before said board, under oath\n      of all of that person's property liable to assessment\n      in such district and the value thereof (footnote\n      added).\n      ¶23    We       acknowledge        that     the     title    of     Wis.    Stat.\n\n§ 70.47(7)(a)         is   \"Objections      to    valuations\"      and    that   (7)(a)\n\naddresses a taxpayer's objection to a valuation.                         Nevertheless,\n\nseveral subsections of § 70.47(7) refer to and govern challenges\n\nto assessments. It is apparent from reading § 70.47(7) in its\n\nentirety that the words \"valuation\" and \"assessment\" are being\n\nused interchangeably in several instances.\n\n      ¶24    Section 70.47 is a long statute with many subsections.\n\nThe   section         is   entitled      \"Board   of     review    proceedings\"        and\n\naddresses board proceedings that involve both objections to the\n\n      16\n       The word \"amount\" has been interpreted to refer to the\namount of property, that is, part or all of the property.

Nothing          in\n\n§ 70.47(7) specifically addresses a board's proceedings when an\n\nobjection is made to a classification of property.                               Because an\n\nassessment involves a classification as well as a valuation, it\n\nmakes    sense          to     treat    § 70.47(7)      as     governing         a    board's\n\nproceedings             regarding         challenges          to     the         valuation,\n\nclassification,              or    assessment       unless    the    substance          of     a\n\nprovision requires a different approach.                        There is no apparent\n\nreason to treat the taxpayer's burden of proof in a challenge to\n\nclassification differently from the taxpayer's burden of proof\n\nin a challenge to a valuation or an assessment.\n\n       ¶25    Furthermore, Wis. Stat. § 70.47(8) governing a hearing\n\nbefore the board \"in relation to the assessment\" informs our\n\ndecision about the taxpayer's burden of proof on the issue of\n\nclassification.              Section 70.47(8)(b) provides that the taxpayer\n\nshall be heard first at the board hearing.                          The party with the\n\nburden       of    proof          ordinarily    presents      first.         Because         an\n\nassessment is based on the classification, this provision in\n\n§ 70.47(8) applying to a challenge to an assessment should be\n\nread to apply to an objection to a classification.\n\n       ¶26    In addition, § 70.47(8)(i) explicitly provides that a\n\nboard shall presume that the assessor's valuation is correct but\n\nthat the presumption may be rebutted by a sufficient showing by\n\nthe    objector         that      the   valuation     is     incorrect.          Again       the\n\nstatutory language is limited to valuations and is silent about\na     presumption            of     correctness       regarding        the       assessor's\n\n                                               11\n\f                                                                  No.    2010AP3015\n\n\n\nclassification:       \"The board shall presume that the assessor's\n\nvaluation is correct.          That presumption may be rebutted by a\n\nsufficient     showing   by    the    objector     that    the    valuation     is\n\nincorrect.\"    Wis. Stat. § 70.47(8)(i).\n\n    ¶27     This    presumption      language    was    added    to   Wis.   Stat.\n\n§ 70.47(8)(i) in 1997.17          Although the presumption language in\n\nWis. Stat. § 70.47(8)(i) limits the presumption of correctness\n\nto the assessor's valuation, we must read § 70.47(8)(i) in the\n\ncontext of the contemporaneous amendment adding                    § 70.47(8)(h)\n\nrequiring     the   assessor    to    \"provide     to     the    board   specific\n\ninformation     about    the   validity     of     the     valuation . . . and\n\ninformation that the assessor used to determine that valuation.\"\n\nThe presumption in § 70.47(8)(i) reinforces the burden of proof\n\nimposed in § 70.47(7) on the taxpayer who objects to valuation\n\nto show at the board hearing that the valuation is erroneous.\n\nEven though the assessor must provide specific information to\n\nthe board regarding the valuation, the burden of proof to show\n\nerror in the assessor's valuation remains on the taxpayer.\n\n    ¶28     Our interpretation of Wis. Stat. § 70.47(7) and (8) to\n\nsupport imposing the burden of proof on the taxpayer challenging\n\nthe assessment or classification at the board is reinforced by\n\n§ 70.47(9), which directs the board how and when to correct an\n\nassessment.     Section 70.47(9) provides that a board shall raise\n\nor lower an assessment \"if the assessment is too high or too\n\nlow\" and \"shall state on the record the correct assessment and\n\n    17\n         1997 Wis. Act 237, § 279m.\n\n                                       12\n\f                                                                            No.      2010AP3015\n\n\n\nthat that assessment is reasonable in light of all the relevant\n\nevidence the board received.\"                  Wis. Stat. § 70.47(9)(a).\n\n       ¶29       Although      Wis.    Stat.     § 70.47(9)(a)         is      silent      about\n\nwhether the taxpayer has the burden of proof in challenging the\n\ncorrectness        of    the     classification,           Wis.   Stat.        § 70.47(9)(a)\n\nexplicitly states that if the vote at the board is a tie vote on\n\nthe     objection        to    the     assessment,         the    assessment         will     be\n\nsustained.         The legislature has thus declared that if the party\n\nwho seeks to raise or lower the assessment fails to persuade a\n\nmajority of the board that the assessment is incorrect, that\n\nparty loses.            In this way, § 70.47(9)(a) makes it absolutely\n\nclear that the burden of persuasion is on the taxpayer to show\n\nthat     an      assessor's         assessment       is    erroneous.            Because      an\n\nassessment depends on a valuation and a classification, it makes\n\nsense       to   apply     the      same   burden     of    proof    to      a      taxpayer's\n\nchallenge to a classification as is applied to a taxpayer's\n\nchallenge to an assessment.\n\n       ¶30       Finally,      our    position       is    supported      by     Wis.      Stat.\n\n§ 74.37.           Under      this     statute,      when    a    taxpayer          uses    this\n\nprocedure         in    circuit       court    to    challenge      an      assessment       as\n\nexcessive, the circuit court reviews the board's determination\n\nde     novo,      giving      \"no     deference       to    the    Board       of     Review's\n\ndecision.\"18            Nevertheless,         \"the    underlying       assessment          still\n\n\n\n       18\n       Metro.

The taxpayer relied entirely on the\n\ntwo maps to show that the property was \"undeveloped land.\"                             The\n\nmaps supported none of the taxpayer's contentions.                       The maps did\n\nnot support the taxpayer's contentions that the board erred;\n\nthat the property was improperly classified as productive forest\n\nland; or that the property should be reclassified as undeveloped\n\nland.     The Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual notes that an\n\naerial photograph showing the presence of trees can indicate\n\nforest classification and the presence of constantly wet soil\n\ncan indicate undeveloped land classification.22                        The taxpayer\n\nthus furnished no evidence that the assessment was not fixed\n\nupon the statutory basis.\n\n    ¶44        In their discussion, members of the board noted that\n\nsome of the property was \"swampland,\" but that the property had\n\n\"a lot of trees on it.\"           The members of the board concluded that\n\nthe classification should be maintained as-is.\n\n\n\n    22\n          1    Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual                  at 11-33 (eff.\n1/09).\n\n                                          18\n\f                                                              No.    2010AP3015\n\n\n\n      ¶45   The circuit court held that the evidence provided by\n\nthe   taxpayer   was   insufficient    to    meet   his   burden    of   proof.\n\nRather, the totality of the evidence was such \"that it might\n\nreasonably sustain the Board's determination.\"                The court of\n\nappeals also held that the taxpayer failed to make a record\n\nshowing that the classification was incorrect.\n\n      ¶46   On certiorari review, a court does not retry the facts\n\nand an assessment must be upheld if it can be supported by any\n\nreasonable view of the evidence.23           This court \"will review the\n\nevidence only so far as to ascertain if there is reasonable\n\nground for belief that the decision [of the board of review] is\n\nthe result of honest judgment, in which case it will not be\n\ndisturbed.\"24\n\n      ¶47   The taxpayer's argument in the present case centers on\n\nthe fourth element of certiorari review, namely that the board's\n\ndetermination    to    adopt   the   assessor's     classification       of   the\n\nproperty is not supported by evidence such that the board might\n\nreasonably make the determination in question.

He lost in the circuit court and on\n\nappeal.\n\n       ¶52    When a taxpayer appears before a board of review, the\n\ntaxpayer should proffer all the evidence available because he\n\nwill    ordinarily      be        limited       to    that      evidence     on       certiorari\nreview.

De novo review will not shift the burden of proof from\n\nthe taxpayer to the board, but it will permit the taxpayer to\n\nbuttress his case with more and different evidence challenging\n\nthe correctness of the board's decision, which is normally based\n\non the assessor's determination.\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f                                                           No.   2010AP3015.dtp\n\n\n     ¶53    In    this   case,   the    taxpayer   did    not    dispute    the\n\nassessor's revaluation of his property.             Rather, the taxpayer\n\ncontended that his property was improperly classified.1\n\n     ¶54    In my view, the taxpayer would have been in a stronger\n\nposition with the board if the assessor had reclassified the\n\nproperty    and   the    resulting     reclassification    had       produced   a\n\nhigher assessment.        In that case, the taxpayer could at least\n\npoint to the classification prior to the change to support his\n\nposition.    Here, it was the taxpayer, not the assessor, who was\n\nseeking to reclassify the property.          Surely the taxpayer had the\n\nburden in these circumstances.\n\n     ¶55    This court does not know when the taxpayer's property\n\nwas first classified as \"productive forest land\" because that\n\nevidence was never offered.          The record shows that the taxpayer\n\nacquired the property in 1977 with a farm, but it does not show\n\nhow the property was classified over the ensuing decades.                   The\n\ntaxpayer did not provide evidence of how his land had changed,\n\nif at all, during his ownership.2            For instance, did he plant\ntrees on the property?           Did he ever harvest trees from the\n\nproperty    for    \"commercial    forest    products\"?          If    he   never\n\nharvested trees, was his failure to do so (1) because he did not\n\n\n     1\n       All reviewing courts concluded that he did not meet his\nburden to accomplish this objective.\n     2\n       The record contains an \"Objection Form For Real Property\nAssessment.\"   The form includes the following question: \"Have\nyou improved, remodeled, added to, or changed this property\nsince acquiring it?\" The taxpayer answered \"No.\" The question\nis sufficiently general that it does not really explore whether\nthe taxpayer did anything to the trees on the property.\n\n                                        2\n\f                                                                         No.    2010AP3015.dtp\n\n\nwant to harvest trees; (2) because the trees were of such poor\n\nquality    that       they        could   not        produce       \"commercial          forest\n\nproducts\"; or (3) because the law would not allow him to harvest\n\ntrees from land designated as wetlands?                         Detailed information on\n\nthese matters might have helped or hurt the taxpayer's case, but\n\nthe absence of detailed information did not help his case.\n\n    ¶56    This justice would have liked to have had a better\n\nexplanation of \"low grade woods\" than what was provided and\n\nevidence   of     whether         the   \"low       grade    woods\"——here         \"low   grade\n\ncedar\"——were capable of producing \"commercial forest products.\"\n\nThis justice would have liked to have known whether all ten\n\nacres of the taxpayer's property were designated \"wetlands,\" as\n\nwell as when they were so designated and by whom.                              Finally, this\n\njustice would have liked information on whether environmental\n\nlaw prevents the harvesting of trees from officially designated\n\nwetlands   so    that       the    forested        land    was    not    able    to    produce\n\n\"commercial forest products.\"                  On certiorari review, of course,\n\nthis court is not able to consider information that was not part\nof the record of proceedings before the Board.\n\n    ¶57    In        sum,    the    taxpayer         failed      to     offer     sufficient\n\nevidence        to      establish          that           his      property           required\n\nreclassification.           Because the Town of Black Creek (the Town)\n\nhad classified similar property the same way, the taxpayer was\n\neffectively     seeking       a    reclassification             that    could    affect    the\n\nclassification of other property in the Town.

First, Article VIII, § 1 of the\n\nWisconsin    Constitution——the        so-called    uniformity         clause——was\n\namended in 1927.         This constitutional provision had read in\n\npart, \"The rule of taxation shall be uniform, and taxes shall be\n\nlevied upon such property as the legislature shall prescribe.\"\n\nWis. Const. art. VIII, § 1 (amended 1927).               The 1927 amendment\n\nchanged this sentence to read, \"The rule of taxation shall be\n\nuniform, and taxes shall be levied upon such property with such\n\nclassifications     as     to   forests     and   minerals,         including   or\n\nseparate or severed from the land, as the legislature shall\n\nprescribe.\"3\n\n     ¶64    Second, the legislature followed up the 1927 amendment\n\nby creating Chapter 77 of the statutes relating to forest crop\n\nlands.     Ch. 454, Laws of 1927.          The original law permitted the\n\nowner of a tract of land that was at least 160 acres to petition\n\n     3\n       Wis. Const. art. VIII, § 1 (amended 1941) (emphasis\nadded).   In the 1941 amendment, the language changed slightly\nbut remained largely the same:\n\n          The rule of taxation shall be uniform but the\n     legislature may empower cities, villages or towns to\n     collect and return taxes on real estate located\n     therein by optional methods. Taxes shall be levied\n     upon such property with such classifications as to\n     forests and minerals including or separate or severed\n     from the land, as the legislature shall prescribe.\n\nWis. Const. art. VIII, § 1.\n\n     In   1974  the   people   approved  another   constitutional\namendment adding the following sentence to Article VIII, § 1:\n\"Taxation of agricultural land and undeveloped land, both as\ndefined by law, need not be uniform with the taxation of each\nother nor with the taxation of other real property.\"\n\n                                       6\n\f                                                                        No.    2010AP3015.dtp\n\n\nthe \"conservation commission\" to designate the land as \"forest\n\ncrop land,\" \"more useful for growing timber and other forest\n\ncrops       than    for    any   other   purpose.\"              Wis.   Stat.       § 77.02(1)\n\n(1927).        Approval of the petition by the commission subjected\n\nthe     property      to     certain     \"forestry\"         practices         as    well      as\n\nsubstantial         tax    benefits.      See      generally       Wis.    Stat.        ch.    77\n\n(1927).       The constitutional amendment contemplated that at least\n\nsome       forest   land    would   be   classified         differently         from     other\n\nland,4 but it did not require that all forest land be classified\n\ndifferently.\n\n       ¶65     Third,      the   legislature       was     in    the   midst       of   giving\n\nmunicipalities extensive planning and zoning authority.                                    See,\n\nfor example, Wis. Stat. § 59.97 (1929), setting out the \"zoning\n\npower\" of counties, which read in part, \"(1) The county board of\n\nany county may by ordinance regulate, restrict and determine the\n\nareas within which agriculture, forestry and recreation may be\n\nconducted,          the    location      of       roads,        schools,       trades         and\n\nindustries, and the location of buildings designed for specified\nuses . . . .\"5            Zoning and the classification of property for\n       4\n       The \"Woodland Tax Law,\" set out in Wis. Stat. § 77.16, was\nnot created until 1953.    See § 2, ch. 384, Laws of 1953.    The\nWoodland Tax Law stated that \"the owner of any tract of land of\nless than 40 acres may file with the conservation director an\napplication setting forth a description of the property which he\ndesires to place under the woodland tax law and on which land he\nwill practice forestry.\"     Id.   If the conservation director\ndetermined that the land was suitable for growing trees of\ncommercial quality, the application would be approved. Id. The\nwoodland would then be taxed at 20 cents per acre, and the owner\nwould be obligated to \"promote the growth of trees.\" Id.\n       5\n       See also chs. 279 and 356, Laws of 1929; ch. 375, Laws of\n1927; ch. 388, Laws of 1923.\n                                              7\n\f                                                       No.   2010AP3015.dtp\n\n\ntaxation appear to overlap, even if that overlap may not be\n\nwholly consistent.\n\n    ¶66    The 1931 legislature6 repealed the existing Wis. Stat.\n\n§ 70.32(2) and replaced it with the following:\n\n         (2) The assessor, having fixed a value, shall\n    enter the same opposite the proper tract or lot in the\n    assessment roll, following the instructions prescribed\n    therein.

He   claimed    that        his   property          had     been     incorrectly\n\nclassified as \"productive forest land.\"                           He asserted that the\n\ncorrect     property     classification                was   \"undeveloped         land,\"       as\n\ndefined     in   Wis.    Stat.    § 70.32(2)(c)4.,              which         would    then    be\n\nassessed at 50 percent of its value pursuant to § 70.32(4).                                   The\n\nboard of review denied his request to reclassify his property,\n\nthereby affirming the $27,500 valuation for his assessment.\n      ¶84    Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 70.47(13), Sausen petitioned\n\nfor a writ of certiorari in regard to the board of review's\n\nclassification      of   his     property         as     \"productive          forest    land.\"1\n\n\n\n      1\n       If he had paid the taxes assessed, Sausen could have\nappealed the assessment pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 74.37(3)(d)\nwherein he would have commenced an independent action in circuit\ncourt subsequent to the board of review's decision. See Nankin\nv.
