Sacks P.C. v. Haden</em>, 266 S.W.3d 447 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam).  Having reinstated\r\nthe summary judgment rendered in favor of appellee, David J. Sacks, P.C. (Sacks)\r\nd/b/a Sacks &amp; Associates (collectively referred to as the law firm) on the law firm's\r\nclaim for breach of the attorney's fee agreement between the law firm and its client,\r\nappellants, Charles M. Haden, Jr., individually (Haden), and Charles McIntyre Haden,\r\nJr. &amp; Company d/b/a Haden &amp; Company (the company), the supreme court has\r\ninstructed this Court to address the company's remaining issues.<sup> (1)</sup>  In these issues,\r\nHaden and the company challenge the final judgment rendered in favor of the law\r\nfirm (1) for $120,887.50 in attorney's fees in connection with pursuing the breach of\r\ncontract claim and (2) on the company's counterclaims for violations of the Deceptive\r\nTrade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (DTPA),<sup> (2)</sup> breach of fiduciary duty,\r\nbreach of contract, and fraud.  We affirm. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Procedural Background </strong></center>\r\n<strong>\t</strong>The law firm's live pleadings asserted claims for (1) a \"suit on sworn account\"\r\nby  claiming that the company accepted the services and became bound to pay the law\r\nfirm on an open account, <em>see</em> </span><span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 185</span><span>, (2) breach of contract, (3) quantum\r\nmeruit, and (4) DTPA violations for counterclaims later filed against the law firm. \r\nThe company answered the petition and asserted its own counterclaims against the law\r\nfirm for fraud, DTPA violations, unconscionable course of action, breach of contract,\r\nand breach of fiduciary duty.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe law firm sought traditional and no-evidence summary judgment on the\r\ncompany's counterclaims.  The company's response to the motion for summary\r\njudgment included a challenge to the affidavit by Sacks that had been attached to the\r\nlaw firm's motion.  The company also offered Haden's affidavit and other evidentiary\r\nexhibits.  In addition to responding on the merits, the law firm's reply included an\r\namended, extensively detailed affidavit executed by Sacks.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn May 11, 2000, the trial court rendered a take-nothing summary judgment in\r\nfavor of the law firm on the company's counterclaims for unconscionable action,\r\nfraud, and violations of the DTPA.  On June 5, 2000, the trial court rendered a take-nothing summary judgment on the company's counterclaims for breach of fiduciary\r\nduty and breach of contract.<sup> (3)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe law firm also sought traditional and no-evidence summary judgment for its\r\nbreach of contract claim by asserting its right to judgment as a matter of law for unpaid\r\nattorney's fees amounting to $30,314.38, pursuant to section 38.001 of the Civil\r\nPractice and Remedies Code. </span><span><em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001-.006\r\n(Vernon 2008).</span><span>  The trial court rendered an interlocutory summary judgment in favor\r\nof the law firm on its breach-of-contract claims for $30,314.38, plus interest.  The trial\r\ncourt also ruled that the law firm was entitled to attorney's fees expended in pursuing\r\nthe contract claim, but reserved ruling on the amount of reasonable attorney's fees. \r\nThe supreme court affirmed this portion of the trial court's final judgment.  <em>Haden</em>,\r\n266 S.W.3d at 450.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTwo months later, the law firm sought a traditional summary judgment against\r\nthe company on the reasonableness of the attorney's fees incurred in seeking the\r\nsummary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim.  The trial court then rendered a\r\nfinal judgment incorporating its earlier ruling on the contract and awarded the law firm\r\nan additional $75,887.50 for attorney's fees incurred in pursuing the contract claim,\r\nwith contingent fees totaling $45,000 for appeals to an intermediate appellate court\r\nand for seeking a petition for review in the supreme court.  The first paragraph of the\r\njudgment recites that Haden and the company filed no response to the law firm's\r\nmotion concerning the attorney's fees sought for pursuit of the contract claim.  This\r\nappeal challenges this portion of the final judgment, which rendered final the trial\r\ncourt's orders rendering summary judgment in favor of the law firm on the company's\r\ncounterclaims.  Haden and the company did not supersede this final judgment, which\r\nprompted postjudgment collection and enforcement procedures.  These culminated in\r\nthe law firm's obtaining turnover relief, for which the firm sought attorney's fees\r\npursuant to section 31.002(e) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.  Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 31.002(e) (Vernon Supp. 2008).  The law firm prevailed\r\nagain and recovered a judgment for $90,000 in attorney's fees.  Haden and the\r\ncompany challenge that judgment in Cause No. 01-03-00025-CV.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Standard of Review</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review summary judgments de novo, <em>Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett</em>, 164\r\nS.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005), and follow the usual standards that apply when a\r\nsummary judgment order grants relief without specifying grounds.  <em>See Dow Chem.\r\nCo. v.

App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).  </span><span>We consider all\r\nsummary judgment grounds on which the trial court ruled and that the appealing party\r\npreserves for appellate review that are necessary for final disposition of the appeal. \r\n<em>See Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v. Cates</em>, 927 S.W.2d 623, 626 (Tex. 1996).  </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe law firm moved for summary judgment under two authorizing rules, rule\r\n166a(c) (\"traditional\" summary judgment) and 166a(i) (\"no-evidence\" summary\r\njudgment).  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c),(i).  For its breach-of-contract and attorney's\r\nfees claims, the law firm moved for traditional summary judgment under rule 166a(c). \r\nFor Haden's and the company's counterclaims, the law firm sought both a traditional\r\nsummary judgment and a no-evidence summary judgment under rule 166a(i).  We\r\napply the standard of review appropriate for each type of summary judgment.  <em>See\r\nFlameout Design &amp; Fabrication, Inc. v. Pennzoil Caspian Corp</em>., 994 S.W.2d 830, 834\r\n(Tex.

The failure to respond to the\r\nlaw firm's motion for traditional summary judgment seeking attorney's fees, however, \r\nhas consequences concerning the recovery of fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.\r\nCode Ann. § 38.001(8).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>1.\tChallenges That May Be Asserted Despite</strong> <strong>Failure to Respond</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\ta.  <em>In General</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the party moving for traditional summary judgment, here the law firm,\r\ncarries the burden to establish that no material fact issue exists and that it is entitled\r\nto judgment as a matter of law, \"the nonmovant has no burden to respond to a\r\nsummary judgment motion unless the movant conclusively establishes its cause of\r\naction or defense.\"  <em>M.D. Anderson Hosp. &amp; Tumor Inst. v. Willrich</em>, 28 S.W.3d 22,\r\n23 (Tex. 2000); <em>see also Rhône-Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel</em>, 997 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Tex.\r\n1999) (\"The trial court may not grant summary judgment by default\" for failure to file\r\na response to a motion for summary judgment \"when movant's summary judgment\r\nproof is legally insufficient.\"); <em>Rizkallah v. Conner</em>, 952 S.W.2d 580, 582-83 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ) (holding that lack of response by nonmovant\r\n\"does not supply by default the summary judgment proof necessary to establish the\r\nmovant's right to summary judgment\" and that nonmovant \"is limited on appeal to\r\narguing the legal sufficiency of the grounds presented by movant\") (citing <em>McConnell\r\nv. Southside Sch. Dist</em>., 858 S.W.2d 337, 343 (Tex. 1993)); <em>Jones v. Legal Copy, Inc.</em>,\r\n846 S.W.2d 922, 924 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, no writ) (holding that\r\nparty who filed no response to motion for summary judgment limited to legal\r\nsufficiency challenge).  Because a motion for summary judgment must stand on its\r\nown merits, the nonmovant may argue on appeal that the movant's summary judgment\r\nproof is insufficient as a matter of law, even if the nonmovant filed no response to the\r\nmotion.  <em>See Willrich</em>, 28 S.W.3d at 23<em>.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>Haden and the company may, therefore, properly contend, on appeal, that the\r\nlaw firm's motion for summary judgment is legally insufficient as a matter of law to\r\nwarrant summary judgment, despite their failure to respond to the law firm's motion\r\nseeking attorney's fees.  But, because \"issues not expressly presented to the trial court\r\nby written motion, answer, or other response\" may not \"be considered on appeal as\r\ngrounds for reversal,\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c), Haden's and the company's challenges\r\nare necessarily limited to challenges to the legal sufficiency of the law firm's motion\r\nfor traditional summary judgment to support judgment as a matter of law.  <em>See Jones</em>,\r\n846 S.W.2d at 924 (citing <em>City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth.</em>, 589 S.W.2d\r\n671, 678 (Tex. 1979)).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t<strong>b.  <em>\"Legal Conclusion\" Challenge</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden and the company challenge the attorney's fee award by asserting that\r\nSacks's affidavit is conclusory and lacks supporting evidence.  A conclusory statement\r\nis objectionable because it lacks supporting, underlying facts.   <em>Anderson v. Snider</em>,\r\n808 S.W.2d 54, 55 (Tex. 1991); <em>Rizkallah</em>, 952 S.W.2d at 587.  Statements that are\r\nnothing more than legal conclusions are not sufficient to support a summary judgment\r\nas a matter of law because they \"reduce to a legal issue a matter that should be\r\nresolved by relying on facts,\" <em>id.</em>, and thus constitute \"merely a sworn denial\" of the\r\nnonmovant's claim.  <em>Rizkallah</em>, 952 S.W.2d at 587 (citing <em>Anderson v. Snider</em>, 808\r\nS.W.2d at 55); <em>see also Burrow v. Arce</em>, 997 S.W.2d 229, 235-36 (Tex. 1999)\r\n(rejecting affidavit by counsel as \"nothing more than a sworn denial of plaintiff's\r\nclaims\" that \"could not support summary judgment\"; further stating that an attorney\r\n\"cannot simply say, \"Take my word for it; I know[.]\").  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden's and the company's contention is reviewable, despite their lack of\r\nresponse to the law firm's motion for traditional summary judgment, because their\r\ncontention, that Sacks's affidavit testimony is conclusory and lacks supporting\r\nevidence, raises a defect of substance that they did not waive by not responding to\r\nSacks's motion.  <em>See Rizkallah</em>, 952 S.W.2d at 587.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor these reasons, we may review Haden's and the company's challenge to\r\nSacks's affidavit on the grounds that it comprises mere legal conclusions. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.  Consequences of Lack of Response for Chapter 38</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConsequences follow from Haden's and the company's lack of response to\r\nSacks's motion for traditional summary judgment seeking attorney's fees pursuant to\r\nchapter 38 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.  To warrant recovery under\r\nsection 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, attorney's fees must be\r\n\"reasonable.\"  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001.  The reasonableness\r\nof an attorney's fee award generally presents a question of fact.  <em>See Ragsdale v.\r\nProgressive Voters League</em>, 801 S.W.2d 880, 881-82 (Tex. 1990);<em> Great Am. Reserve\r\nIns. Co. v. Britton</em>, 406 S.W.2d 901, 907 (Tex. 1966);<em> Tesoro Petroleum Corp. v.\r\nCoastal Ref. &amp; Mktg, Inc</em>., 754 S.W.2d 764, 767 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.]\r\n1988, writ denied).  </span><span>An award of attorney's fees must be supported by evidence that\r\nthe fees were both reasonable and necessary.  <em>See Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling</em>,\r\n822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991).  A trial court determines the reasonableness of an\r\nattorney's fee award by considering the factors enumerated in <em>Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.\r\nv. Perry Equip. Corp.</em>, 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997) (quoting Tex. Disciplinary\r\nR. Prof. Conduct 1.04(b), <em>reprinted in </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. tit. 2, subtit. G app.\r\n(State Bar Rules, art.

(quoting <em>Andersen</em> factors). </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSection 38.003 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code creates a statutory\r\npresumption that the \"usual and customary attorney's fees\" are reasonable for a\r\nchapter 38 claim.  <em>See </em>Tex.

Although the\r\npresumption is rebuttable, once triggered, <em>see id.</em>, it remains unrebutted when, as here,\r\nthere has been no challenge to the proof provided by the summary judgment movant. \r\n<em>See Gen.

It is undisputed that the trial court granted the law firm's request\r\nfor attorney's fees pursuant to Chapter 38.  Accordingly, Haden's and the company's\r\nchallenges to the award must be reviewed within the statutory framework of chapter\r\n38, specifically, its presumption of reasonableness.  Tex. Civ.

Civ. Prac. &amp;\r\nRem. Code Ann. §§ 38.003, 38.005, we turn to Haden's and the company's legal-sufficiency challenges to the trial court's rendering summary judgment in favor of the\r\nlaw firm for $120,887.50 in attorney's fees and costs.  Haden's and the company's\r\nchallenges include their contention that the affidavit offered by Sacks to support the\r\naward of attorney's fees, set forth in full above, consists of mere legal conclusions that\r\nare legally insufficient to support the award.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>1.\tContents of Affidavit</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe affidavit demonstrates, on its face, Sacks's competency to swear to the facts\r\nstated in the affidavit and his capacity to state that he had personal knowledge of those\r\nfacts.  In addition to his role as president and custodian of the records of the law firm\r\nand as counsel in this litigation, Sacks described his qualifications as counsel, which\r\nincluded his board certification in civil appellate law by the Texas Board of Legal\r\nSpecialization.  We hold that these recitals establish compliance with the requirements\r\nof rule 166a(f).  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(f) (stating formal requirements for summary\r\njudgment affidavits).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the affidavit, Sacks described the work encompassed by the fees sought,\r\nwhich included drafting original and amended pleadings, conducting discovery, filing\r\nmotions, responding to motions, and preparing for and appearing in court.  These facts\r\nare not \"generalities,\" as Haden and the company contend, but \"clear, positive, and\r\ndirect, otherwise credible\" and are neither internally inconsistent nor contain\r\ncontradictions.  <em>See</em>  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).  Although Haden and the company did\r\nnot controvert the affidavit, all facts stated in it \"could have been readily\r\ncontroverted.\"  <em>See id.</em>  As such, Sacks's affidavit meets the standards for summary\r\njudgment evidence stated in rule 166a(c).  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, Sacks's affidavit specifies the factors that determined the basis for\r\nhis statement that $75,887.50 was a \"reasonable and necessary\" amount for fees and\r\nexpenses.  Sacks tracked seven of the eight recognized, non-exclusive factors that\r\ncourts properly consider in determining whether a fee is reasonable.  <em>See Arthur\r\nAndersen &amp; Co.</em>, 945 S.W.2d at 818 (quoting Tex.

Because Haden and\r\nthe company did not controvert Sacks's affidavit or otherwise dispute the law firm's\r\nevidence, the law firm was further entitled to the statutory presumption that the\r\nrequested amount was both reasonable and necessary.  <em>See </em>Tex.

Moreover, neither <em>Burrow </em>nor <em>Anderson\r\n</em>construes provisions of chapter 38 or challenges an affidavit offered in support of a\r\nmotion for summary judgment seeking attorney's fees pursuant to chapter 38.  <em>See\r\nBurrow</em>, 997 S.W.2d at 234-38; <em>Anderson</em>, 808 S.W.2d at 55.  Accordingly, the\r\nsummary judgment evidence reviewed in those cases did not encompass, as the\r\nevidence here necessarily does, the statutory presumption of reasonableness.  <em>See\r\nBurrow</em>, 997 S.W.2d at 234-38; <em>Anderson</em>, 808 S.W.2d at 55; Tex.

Co. v. Aztec Equip. Co.</em>, 582\r\nS.W.2d 870, 873 (Tex. Civ. App.--San Antonio 1979, no writ); <em>Lindley v. Smith</em>, 524\r\nS.W.2d 520, 524 (Tex. Civ.

We\r\ndistinguish these cases because they predate the <em>Andersen v. Perry</em> factors of rule 1.04\r\nof the State Bar Rules.  Moreover, none of these cases considers chapter 38's\r\npresumption of reasonableness for unrebutted proof of reasonable fees.  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.003.  Considering section 38.003 with the lack of\r\nresponse or controverting proof by Haden and the company, lack of additional,\r\nsupporting documentation did not preclude the trial court from considering and relying\r\non Sacks's affidavit as competent summary judgment evidence. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>3.\tExcessiveness Challenge</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden and the company contend that this Court \"need consider nothing more\r\nthan the amount sought\" to conclude that the amount requested \"creates, at best, a fact\r\nissue.\"  As addressed above, Sacks's affidavit constitutes competent summary\r\njudgment evidence that could have been readily controverted, but was not.  Having\r\nfailed to controvert the law firm's evidence, Haden and the company cannot overcome\r\nthe presumption of reasonableness of section 38.003.  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ.

First State Bank</em>, 747\r\nS.W.2d 783, 785 (Tex. 1988); <em>C.M. Asfahl Agency</em>, 135 S.W.3d at 801.  Failure to\r\nsegregate reasonably recoverable fees from nonrecoverable fees can result in rendition\r\nof a judgment that vacates attorney's fees or severs the fee dispute for remand for trial. \r\n<em>Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 11.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSettled law, however, holds that a party waives any error arising from possibly\r\nawarding nonrecoverable fees when the complaining party does not object to failure\r\nto segregate between legal services for which fees are properly recoverable and those\r\nfor which no recovery of fees is authorized.  <em>Solis</em>, 951 S.W.2d at 389-90; <em>Hruska</em>, 747\r\nS.W.2d at 785; <em>Aero Energy, Inc. v. Circle C Drilling Co.</em>, 699 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.\r\n1985); <em>Matthews v. Candlewood Builders, Inc.</em>, 685 S.W.2d 649, 650 (Tex. 1985);\r\n<em>C.M. Asfahl Agency</em>, 135 S.W.3d at 801.  By not responding to the law firm's motion\r\nfor summary judgment, Haden and the company waived any complaint premised on\r\nfailure to segregate nonrecoverable fees.  For this reason and also because rule 166a(c)\r\nprecludes our addressing issues not presented to the trial court beyond the legal\r\nsufficiency of the motion and properly assertable defects of substance, as addressed\r\nabove, we reject Haden's and the law firm's contention that lack of segregation\r\nmandates reversal.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ.

The grounds asserted in the law firm's no-evidence\r\nmotion for summary judgment on the counterclaims included the law firm's contention\r\nthat it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Haden and the company had\r\nnot incurred any damages on any of their counterclaims.<sup> (10)</sup></span><span>  </span><span><em>See </em>Tex.

First Evangelical Lutheran\r\nChurch</em>, 235 S.W.3d 811, 814 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist. 2007, no pet.).  As the\r\nparty seeking summary judgment in this case, the law firm was required to assert that\r\nno evidence existed as to one or more of the essential elements of Haden's and the\r\ncompany's counterclaims, on which they would have the burden of proof at trial, and\r\nalso to state specifically the element or elements as to which there was no evidence.<em> \r\nSee Johnson v. Brewer and Pritchard, P.C</em>., 73 S.W.3d 193, 207 (Tex. 2002);<em> Mathis</em>,\r\n189 S.W.3d at 844; <em>Flameout Design &amp; Fabrication, Inc.</em>, 994 S.W.2d at 834.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn moving for no-evidence summary judgment, the law firm enumerated each\r\nof Haden's and the company's counterclaims, listed the elements of each counterclaim,\r\nand asserted that Haden and the company had not incurred any damages, a required\r\nelement of each of their counterclaims.  This showing by the law firm satisfied the\r\nmovant's initial burden, as stated in rule 166a(i).  <em>See Johnson</em>, 73 S.W.3d at 207;\r\n<em>Mathis</em>, 189 S.W.3d at 844; <em>Flameout Design &amp; Fabrication Inc.</em>, 994 S.W.2d at 834. \r\nAccordingly, the burden shifted to Haden and the company to provide some evidence,\r\nmore than a scintilla, that raised a fact issue concerning whether they had incurred\r\ndamages for the counterclaims they had asserted against the law firm.  <em>See </em>Tex. R.\r\nCiv. P. 166a(i); <em>Rueda v. Paschal</em>, 178 S.W.3d 107, 109 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 2005, no pet.); <em>Mathis</em>, 189 S.W.3d at 844.  The burden having shifted to Haden\r\nand the company, the trial court had a mandatory duty, pursuant to rule 166a(I), to\r\ngrant the law firm's no-evidence motion for summary judgment unless Haden and the\r\ncompany responded to that motion by producing more than a scintilla of evidence that\r\nraised a genuine issue of material fact on the challenged damages elements.  <em>See </em>Tex.\r\nR.

If the summary judgment record shows that Haden and the company presented\r\nmore than a scintilla of probative evidence that raised a genuine issue of material fact\r\non the challenged element, then the trial court erred by rendering the no-evidence\r\nsummary judgment and we must reverse.  <em>See Rueda</em>, 178 S.W.3d at 109. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B.\tChallenge to Damages Element for Each of the Counterclaims</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden and the company asserted the following counterclaims against the law\r\nfirm:  DTPA violations, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract.  The\r\nlaw firm filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, contending that there was\r\nno evidence of damages for any of the counterclaims.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response to the motion for summary judgment, Haden and the company\r\nclaimed they were damaged in two ways.  They claimed first that they were damaged\r\nby the charge of excessive fees that exceeded the amount that they had agreed to pay\r\npursuant to the fee agreement, because Sacks allowed his associates to perform the\r\nwork rather than doing it himself.  Haden and the company then argued that they\r\nsuffered damages because they incurred legal fees to defend against the lawsuit filed\r\nby Sacks for the unpaid fee invoices.<sup> (11)</sup>  The summary judgment evidence provided by\r\nHaden and the company includes Haden's affidavit,<sup> (12)</sup> the correspondence between\r\nSacks and Haden that formed the written agreement here, and copies of invoices\r\nshowing that Sacks worked 28 hours at $5,600, another attorney worked 37 hours at\r\n$6,475, and another attorney worked 161.75 hours at $24,262.50.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response, the law firm contended that \"Haden improperly attempts to label\r\nhis possible legal fees in defending this suit on a sworn account as 'damages.'\"  Sacks\r\nalso argued that, because Haden acknowledged having agreed to pay at least the\r\n$10,000 he paid and thus could not have been damaged merely because he was billed\r\nan additional amount.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tAnalysis</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that Haden and the company failed to produce more than a\r\nscintilla of evidence of damages for any of their counterclaims. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t1.\tDTPA Violations, Fraud, and Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tTo establish a claim for violations of the DTPA, a plaintiff must show that he\r\nsustained damages.  <em>See</em> Tex.

In addition, Haden and the company expressly stated in their response\r\nto the motion for summary judgment that they were not complaining of \"legal\r\nmalpractice\" or \"the quality of the work.\"<sup> (14)</sup>  Their contentions are premised instead on\r\nwhether Haden and the company sustained damages by the law firm's charging more\r\nfor legal services than Haden and the company believe they were obligated to pay\r\nunder the fee agreement.  Even if we assume that Haden and the company were billed\r\nmore than they agreed to pay, they have never asserted a claim for reimbursement of\r\nthe $10,000 already paid to the law firm.  Haden and the company have not shown,\r\ntherefore, how they were damaged by invoices that charged in excess of the $10,000\r\nthat they acknowledge was due to the law firm. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden and the company also claim that were damaged because Sacks told\r\nHaden that he would perform the legal services himself, but instead delegated most of\r\nthe work to associates.  They contend that Sacks's misrepresentation--that he would\r\nperform the work himself--resulted in damages because the inexperienced associates\r\ntook more time to perform the work than Sacks would have taken, had he performed\r\nthe work himself, and the bill was, therefore, higher than it should have been.  Haden\r\nstated in his affidavit, \"It was clear to me that the size of the bill was directly related\r\nto the inexperience of the attorney doing most of the work.\"  Haden did not explain\r\nthis statement, however, and provided no evidence to support his perception.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is undisputed that the associates' time was billed at a lower rate than Sacks. \r\nYet, even if we assume that Haden is correct that it took more time for the\r\ninexperienced attorney to perform the task that Sacks had taken, Haden and the\r\ncompany presented no evidence in the trial court to establish how long it would take\r\nan experienced attorney to perform the task in comparison to the time that an associate\r\nwould take.  Though a more experienced attorney could arguably perform the task\r\nmore quickly, that attorney's higher billing rate could also result in a higher charge\r\nthan for work done by an associate who took more time to complete the task at a lower\r\nrate.  Having provided no evidence, however, Haden's and the company's contentions\r\ndid not give rise to any triable issues of fact that Sacks's failure to perform the work\r\nhimself resulted in damages.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn sum, the record establishes that the damages alleged by Haden and the\r\ncompany consist solely of claims for legal fees that they incurred in defending against\r\nthe lawsuit filed by Sacks for the unpaid fee invoices.  As well-settled law recognizes,\r\nhowever, attorney's fees incurred to <em>defend</em> a lawsuit filed by another are not\r\nrecoverable.<em>  See Tana Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. McCall</em>, 104 S.W.3d 80, 82 (Tex. 2003)\r\n(rejecting damages described solely in terms of \"value of time spent\" and \"costs\r\nincurred\" in defending lawsuit as nonrecoverable, even if party seeking such damages\r\ncould have proven all other elements of claim for tortious interference); <em>cf.</em>, </span><span><em>Holland\r\nv. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</em>, 1 S.W.3d 91, 95 (Tex. 1999) (reiterating settled law\r\nproscribing award of attorneys' fees without statutory or contractual authority).  </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that Haden and the Company are not entitled to recover attorney's\r\nfees for their claims of DTPA violations and fraud because there is no showing of an\r\nactual-damages recovery.  <em>See Gulf States Util.,</em> 79 S.W.3d at 567 (DTPA); <em>Hennigan,\r\n</em>593 S.W.2d at 385 (fraud); <em>Town East Ford Sales, Inc., </em>730 S.W.2d at 812 (fraud). \r\nWe further conclude that Haden and the company are not entitled to attorney's fees\r\nrecovery in their claim for breach of fiduciary duty because they did not seek forfeiture\r\nof the attorney's fees paid to the law firm as damages or establish any other type of\r\ncompensable damages for that claim.  <em>See Burrow, </em>997 S.W.2d at 240.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe therefore hold that Haden and the company offered no evidence that they\r\nsustained damages and, therefore, that the trial court properly rendered the no-evidence summary judgment in favor of the law firm on Haden's and the company's\r\ncounterclaims for DTPA violations, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty.  </span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.\tBreach of Contract</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"The elements of a breach of contract claim are:  (1) the existence of a valid\r\ncontract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff;  (3) breach of the\r\ncontract by the defendant; and (4) damages to the plaintiff resulting from that breach.\"\r\n<em>Wright v. Christian &amp; Smith</em>, 950 S.W.2d 411, 412 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.]\r\n1997, no writ).  A party may recover attorney's fees in a breach of contract claim\r\nwithout an agreement providing for them if the party claiming the fees (1) prevails on\r\nits breach of contract claim and (2) recovers damages.  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.\r\nCode Ann. § 38.002; <em>Solis</em>, 951 S.W.2d at 390.  Haden and the company provided no\r\nsummary-judgment evidence showing that they could recover the damages they have\r\nasserted for breach of contract.<sup> (15)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden asserted that: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t. . . it is undisputed that David Sacks performed <strong>some\r\n</strong>services for HADEN.  However, HADEN agreed to hire a\r\nboard certified, appellate specialist with 12 years[']\r\nexperience to handle his appeal--not inexperienced\r\nassociates with fewer than 2 years of experience between\r\nthem.  HADEN would never have hired SACKS to\r\nrepresent him had he known that nearly 90% of the work on\r\nthis appeal would be done by lawyers whose inexperience\r\nwould result in their requiring nearly 200 hours to complete\r\nthe work.  HADEN did not agree to pay a fee which would\r\nsupport this many hours of work nor did he agree to provide\r\nan opportunity for new appellate lawyers to learn their\r\ntrade.  HADEN believed he was hiring David J. Sacks,\r\nBoard Certified Appellate Specialist to do most, if not all,\r\nof the work on his appeal for a certain fee.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>(All emphasis in original.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe law firm contends that, because the agreement plainly provides that\r\ndifferent lawyers in the law firm would provide legal services to Haden and the\r\ncompany, no breach of contract occurred.  The law firm further contends that Haden's\r\naffidavit \"constitutes no evidence and cannot be considered\" because \"Haden cannot\r\nintroduce this parol evidence to vary the terms of the contract between the Law Firm\r\nand Haden.\"  The supreme court has approved this reasoning in reinstating the\r\nsummary judgment rendered on the law firm's breach-of-contract claim.  <em>See Sacks</em>,\r\n266 S.W.3d at 451.  We therefore reject Haden's and the company reliance on Haden's\r\naffidavit to create a triable issue of fact to support a claim for breach of contract by\r\nhim and the company by varying the terms of their fee agreement with the law firm. \r\n<em>See id</em>.; <em>Messer v. Johnson</em>, 422 S.W.2d 908, 912 (Tex. 1968); <em>Gonzalez v. United\r\nBros. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am.</em>, 93 S.W.3d 208, 211 (Tex.

This fee agreement provided that Sacks and his associates would\r\nwork on the appellate brief for Haden and the company at specified rates.  We\r\nconclude that Haden and the company have not produced any evidence that they were\r\ndamaged by the fees charged by the law firm, which comported with the terms of that\r\nwritten agreement.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold that the only evidence that Haden and the company offered in response\r\nto the law firm's motion for no-evidence summary judgment negated any recovery for\r\ntheir counterclaims and was, therefore, no evidence that they incurred any damages\r\non their counterclaims.  <em>See</em> <em>City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 823;<em> King Ranch</em>, 118\r\nS.W.3d at 751; <em>Mathis</em>, 189 S.W.3d at 844.  The trial court thus properly granted the\r\nlaw firm's motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule 166a(i).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule issue three.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Conclusion</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center></center>\r\n\tSherry Radack</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChief Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Panel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Higley and Nuchia.<sup> (16)</sup>\r\n<p>1. The supreme court held that the parol evidence rule barred Haden's and the\r\ncompany's evidence of an oral agreement to cap fees.  <em>David J. Sacks, P.C. v. Haden</em>,\r\n266 S.W.3d 447, 451 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam).  This disposition effectively reinstated\r\nthe interlocutory summary judgment rendered in favor of the law firm in the amount\r\nof $30,314.38 plus interest.  The $30,314.38 amount represents the attorney's fees\r\nowed to the law firm under its fee agreement with Haden and the company.  \r\n</p><p>2. Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 17.41-.854 (Vernon 2002 &amp; Supp. 2008).\r\n</p><p>3. Haden and the company then sought to recuse the trial court, but did not succeed. \r\nThis ruling has not been challenged on appeal.\r\n</p><p>4. Haden's and the company's issue does not directly challenge the $45,000 in fees\r\nawarded contingently in the event of an appeal.\r\n</p><p>5. Chapter 38 further provides that the trial court \"may take judicial notice of the usual\r\nand customary attorney's fees and of the contents of the file of the case file without\r\nreceiving further evidence in . . . a proceeding before the court,\" as occurred here. \r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.004.  In addition, section 38.005 compels\r\nthat chapter 38 \"shall be liberally construed to promote its underlying purposes.\" \r\nTex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.005.  The record, however, does not suggest \r\nthat either statute affected the trial court's reasoning in rendering summary judgment. \r\nAccordingly, our analysis may not encompass these additional statutory provisions.\r\n<em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c) (\"Issues not expressly presented to the trial court by\r\nwritten motion, answer or other response shall not be considered on appeal as grounds\r\nfor reversal.\").\r\n</p><p>6. Rule 1.04(a) prohibits illegal or unconscionable fees and states that a fee is\r\nunconscionable if \"a competent lawyer could not form a reasonable belief that the fee\r\nis reasonable.\"  Tex.

G app. (State Bar Rules, art. X, § 9))</span><span>.\r\n<p>7. At oral submission of this case, counsel for Haden and the company directed us to two\r\nrecent opinions of the Supreme Court of Texas, each of which resulted in judgments\r\nof remand for a new trial to determine the amount of attorney's fees.  <em>See Young v.\r\nQualls</em>, 223 S.W.3d 312 (Tex. 2007); <em>Barker v. Eckman</em>, 213 S.W.3d 306 (Tex. 2006).\r\nBoth cases were appeals from trials on the merits, as opposed to appeals from a\r\nsummary judgment, as here.  More importantly, though each addressed disparity\r\nbetween the damages awarded and the attorney's fees awarded, the disparity arose\r\nfrom the appellate court's having suggested a remittitur of damages award on which\r\nthe award of attorney's fees was based.  <em>See Young</em>, 223 S.W.3d at 314; <em>Barker</em>, 213\r\nS.W.3d at 314.  There is no possibility of remittitur here because the $30,314.38\r\ndamages awarded by the trial court derives from the summary judgment rendered in\r\nfavor of the law firm, which the supreme has recently affirmed.  <em>See Sacks</em>, 266\r\nS.W.3d at 450.\r\n</p><p>8. We also distinguish <em>Rasmusson v. LBC PetrUnited, Inc.</em>, 124 S.W.3d 283 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied), on which Haden and the company\r\nrelied in postsubmission briefing, and in which our sister court initially reversed a\r\njudgment that awarded a specific amount of costs on the grounds that the affidavit\r\nprovided by counsel stated only conclusorily that \"reasonable costs of $403.71 have\r\nbeen incurred . . . ,\" but provided no other supporting evidence.  <em>Id.</em> at 288; <em>see also\r\nid.</em> at 289 (affirming judgment upon voluntary remittitur of costs).  In the case before\r\nus, the law firm did not request a specific award of costs in seeking summary\r\njudgment, Sacks's affidavit does not specify an amount of costs, and the final\r\njudgment does not award a specific amount of costs.  Moreover, <em>Rasmusson</em> was not\r\ndecided pursuant to chapter 38 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.  \r\n</p><p>9. </p></span><span>Because the trial court rendered the summary judgment on the counterclaims early in\r\nthe case, the judgment was interlocutory until it became merged with the final\r\njudgment from which Haden and the company appeal.  <em>See City of Houston v. Socony\r\nMobil Oil Co.</em>, 421 S.W.2d 427, 430 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1967, writ\r\nref'd n.r.e.). \r\n<p>10. </p></span><span>The law firm's motion also included a traditional motion for summary judgment on\r\nHaden's and the company's counterclaims. <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\r\n<p>11. Haden and the company stated, as follows:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tHADEN has been damaged.  HADEN has been sued under a contract which\r\nhe did not make, <em>has been forced to hire an attorney to defend him in that\r\nlawsuit</em>, <em>and may have to pay excess fees incurred</em> when SACKS did not do the\r\nwork but shuffled it off to an inexperienced, unprepared associate with less\r\nthan three months experience who spent an inordinate amount of time on the\r\nproject.  As a result, <em>the fees over which this lawsuit was filed are higher than\r\nthe amount of money provided in the contract between the parties.</em>  It is\r\ndifficult to imagine that such a project would require the same amount of time\r\nby an attorney with twelve years['] experience as it would with three months[']\r\nexperience.<strong>  </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>(Italicized emphasis added; uppercase emphasis in original).  \r\n<p>12. The affidavit by Haden states, as follows:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t. . . Based on Mr. Sacks representative [sic] as an appellate expert, I\r\nhired Mr. Sacks to put an edge on my trial lawyer's brief.  At the outset\r\nof the engagement, I indicated that all I could pay was $5,000 for the\r\nwork he proposed[,] and he said it could be as high as $10,000. \r\nBelieving I was obtaining the services of an experienced appellate\r\nexpert, I agreed to have Mr. Sacks do the work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\tInitially, Mr. Sacks asked me to pay $10,000 to him and he who [sic]\r\nwould bill his charges against the deposit.  After discussing why all I\r\nwas willing to pay him was $5,000, Mr. Sacks and I agreed that I could\r\ngive him $5,000 to assist in the writing of the brief.  At no time, or\r\nunder any circumstances, did I agree to pay Mr. Sacks more than\r\n$10,000 for the work he proposed to do for me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tOn or about September 15, 1997, I received a statement from Mr. Sacks which\r\nindicated an outstanding balance of more than $37,000.  Mr. Sacks never\r\ncontacted me prior to my receiving the bill to say that the project was going to\r\nbe more expensive than we originally believed or to indicate that he would be\r\nunable to do a substantial portion of the work on the brief himself.  When I\r\nreviewed the bill I was surprised to discover that the vast majority of the work\r\non the brief had been done, not by Mr. Sacks, but by two other attorneys in his\r\nfirm.  I subsequently learned that they were young associates with fewer than\r\ntwo years['] experience between them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tFurther perusal of the bill revealed that one of the attorneys had billed\r\n161.75 hours to my case and Sacks had only billed 28 hours.  I learned\r\nthat Kathleen Peterson nee'[sic] Hoekstra had only been practicing\r\nthree months when working on my appeal.  It was clear to me that the\r\nsize of the bill was directly related to the inexperience of the attorney\r\ndoing most of the work.\r\n<p>13. For the first time on appeal, Haden and the company assert fee forfeiture as a ground\r\nfor damages on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.  We may not address this\r\ncontention because it was never presented to the trial court.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n166a(c).\r\n</p><p>14. For the first time on appeal, Haden and the company contend that if Sacks had\r\nperformed the work himself rather than giving the work to associates, the odds of\r\nobtaining a  reversal and retrial would have significantly increased.  Haden and the\r\ncompany did not present that argument to the trial court in support of their claim for\r\ndamages and presented no summary judgment evidence to support the argument.  \r\n</p><p>15. As the preceding analysis demonstrates, Haden and the company did not prevail. \r\nWhen the trial court rendered summary judgment on their counterclaims, however,\r\nthe summary judgment was interlocutory and not yet final.  Because the trial court had\r\nnot yet determined who would ultimately prevail, it could not have rendered summary\r\njudgment on the ground that Haden and the company did not prevail.  \r\n</p><p>16. Justice Sam Nuchia, who retired from the First Court of Appeals on January 1, 2009,\r\ncontinues to sit by assignment for the disposition of this case, which was submitted\r\non December 16, 2008.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

The trial\r\ncourt also ruled that the law firm was entitled to attorney's fees expended in pursuing\r\nthe contract claim, but reserved ruling on the amount of reasonable attorney's fees. \r\nThe supreme court affirmed this portion of the trial court's final judgment.  <em>Haden</em>,\r\n266 S.W.3d at 450.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTwo months later, the law firm sought a traditional summary judgment against\r\nthe company on the reasonableness of the attorney's fees incurred in seeking the\r\nsummary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim.  The trial court then rendered a\r\nfinal judgment incorporating its earlier ruling on the contract and awarded the law firm\r\nan additional $75,887.50 for attorney's fees incurred in pursuing the contract claim,\r\nwith contingent fees totaling $45,000 for appeals to an intermediate appellate court\r\nand for seeking a petition for review in the supreme court.  The first paragraph of the\r\njudgment recites that Haden and the company filed no response to the law firm's\r\nmotion concerning the attorney's fees sought for pursuit of the contract claim.  This\r\nappeal challenges this portion of the final judgment, which rendered final the trial\r\ncourt's orders rendering summary judgment in favor of the law firm on the company's\r\ncounterclaims.  Haden and the company did not supersede this final judgment, which\r\nprompted postjudgment collection and enforcement procedures.  These culminated in\r\nthe law firm's obtaining turnover relief, for which the firm sought attorney's fees\r\npursuant to section 31.002(e) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.  Tex.

In addition to his role as president and custodian of the records of the law firm\r\nand as counsel in this litigation, Sacks described his qualifications as counsel, which\r\nincluded his board certification in civil appellate law by the Texas Board of Legal\r\nSpecialization.  We hold that these recitals establish compliance with the requirements\r\nof rule 166a(f).  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(f) (stating formal requirements for summary\r\njudgment affidavits).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the affidavit, Sacks described the work encompassed by the fees sought,\r\nwhich included drafting original and amended pleadings, conducting discovery, filing\r\nmotions, responding to motions, and preparing for and appearing in court.  These facts\r\nare not \"generalities,\" as Haden and the company contend, but \"clear, positive, and\r\ndirect, otherwise credible\" and are neither internally inconsistent nor contain\r\ncontradictions.  <em>See</em>  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).  Although Haden and the company did\r\nnot controvert the affidavit, all facts stated in it \"could have been readily\r\ncontroverted.\"  <em>See id.</em>  As such, Sacks's affidavit meets the standards for summary\r\njudgment evidence stated in rule 166a(c).  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, Sacks's affidavit specifies the factors that determined the basis for\r\nhis statement that $75,887.50 was a \"reasonable and necessary\" amount for fees and\r\nexpenses.  Sacks tracked seven of the eight recognized, non-exclusive factors that\r\ncourts properly consider in determining whether a fee is reasonable.  <em>See Arthur\r\nAndersen &amp; Co.</em>, 945 S.W.2d at 818 (quoting Tex.

Because Haden and\r\nthe company did not controvert Sacks's affidavit or otherwise dispute the law firm's\r\nevidence, the law firm was further entitled to the statutory presumption that the\r\nrequested amount was both reasonable and necessary.  <em>See </em>Tex.

Accordingly, the\r\nsummary judgment evidence reviewed in those cases did not encompass, as the\r\nevidence here necessarily does, the statutory presumption of reasonableness.  <em>See\r\nBurrow</em>, 997 S.W.2d at 234-38; <em>Anderson</em>, 808 S.W.2d at 55; Tex.

Moreover, none of these cases considers chapter 38's\r\npresumption of reasonableness for unrebutted proof of reasonable fees.  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.003.  Considering section 38.003 with the lack of\r\nresponse or controverting proof by Haden and the company, lack of additional,\r\nsupporting documentation did not preclude the trial court from considering and relying\r\non Sacks's affidavit as competent summary judgment evidence. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>3.\tExcessiveness Challenge</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden and the company contend that this Court \"need consider nothing more\r\nthan the amount sought\" to conclude that the amount requested \"creates, at best, a fact\r\nissue.\"  As addressed above, Sacks's affidavit constitutes competent summary\r\njudgment evidence that could have been readily controverted, but was not.  Having\r\nfailed to controvert the law firm's evidence, Haden and the company cannot overcome\r\nthe presumption of reasonableness of section 38.003.  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ.

They claimed first that they were damaged\r\nby the charge of excessive fees that exceeded the amount that they had agreed to pay\r\npursuant to the fee agreement, because Sacks allowed his associates to perform the\r\nwork rather than doing it himself.  Haden and the company then argued that they\r\nsuffered damages because they incurred legal fees to defend against the lawsuit filed\r\nby Sacks for the unpaid fee invoices.<sup> (11)</sup>  The summary judgment evidence provided by\r\nHaden and the company includes Haden's affidavit,<sup> (12)</sup> the correspondence between\r\nSacks and Haden that formed the written agreement here, and copies of invoices\r\nshowing that Sacks worked 28 hours at $5,600, another attorney worked 37 hours at\r\n$6,475, and another attorney worked 161.75 hours at $24,262.50.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response, the law firm contended that \"Haden improperly attempts to label\r\nhis possible legal fees in defending this suit on a sworn account as 'damages.'\"  Sacks\r\nalso argued that, because Haden acknowledged having agreed to pay at least the\r\n$10,000 he paid and thus could not have been damaged merely because he was billed\r\nan additional amount.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tAnalysis</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that Haden and the company failed to produce more than a\r\nscintilla of evidence of damages for any of their counterclaims. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t1.\tDTPA Violations, Fraud, and Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tTo establish a claim for violations of the DTPA, a plaintiff must show that he\r\nsustained damages.  <em>See</em> Tex.

In addition, Haden and the company expressly stated in their response\r\nto the motion for summary judgment that they were not complaining of \"legal\r\nmalpractice\" or \"the quality of the work.\"<sup> (14)</sup>  Their contentions are premised instead on\r\nwhether Haden and the company sustained damages by the law firm's charging more\r\nfor legal services than Haden and the company believe they were obligated to pay\r\nunder the fee agreement.  Even if we assume that Haden and the company were billed\r\nmore than they agreed to pay, they have never asserted a claim for reimbursement of\r\nthe $10,000 already paid to the law firm.  Haden and the company have not shown,\r\ntherefore, how they were damaged by invoices that charged in excess of the $10,000\r\nthat they acknowledge was due to the law firm. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden and the company also claim that were damaged because Sacks told\r\nHaden that he would perform the legal services himself, but instead delegated most of\r\nthe work to associates.  They contend that Sacks's misrepresentation--that he would\r\nperform the work himself--resulted in damages because the inexperienced associates\r\ntook more time to perform the work than Sacks would have taken, had he performed\r\nthe work himself, and the bill was, therefore, higher than it should have been.  Haden\r\nstated in his affidavit, \"It was clear to me that the size of the bill was directly related\r\nto the inexperience of the attorney doing most of the work.\"  Haden did not explain\r\nthis statement, however, and provided no evidence to support his perception.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is undisputed that the associates' time was billed at a lower rate than Sacks. \r\nYet, even if we assume that Haden is correct that it took more time for the\r\ninexperienced attorney to perform the task that Sacks had taken, Haden and the\r\ncompany presented no evidence in the trial court to establish how long it would take\r\nan experienced attorney to perform the task in comparison to the time that an associate\r\nwould take.  Though a more experienced attorney could arguably perform the task\r\nmore quickly, that attorney's higher billing rate could also result in a higher charge\r\nthan for work done by an associate who took more time to complete the task at a lower\r\nrate.  Having provided no evidence, however, Haden's and the company's contentions\r\ndid not give rise to any triable issues of fact that Sacks's failure to perform the work\r\nhimself resulted in damages.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn sum, the record establishes that the damages alleged by Haden and the\r\ncompany consist solely of claims for legal fees that they incurred in defending against\r\nthe lawsuit filed by Sacks for the unpaid fee invoices.  As well-settled law recognizes,\r\nhowever, attorney's fees incurred to <em>defend</em> a lawsuit filed by another are not\r\nrecoverable.<em>  See Tana Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v.

A party may recover attorney's fees in a breach of contract claim\r\nwithout an agreement providing for them if the party claiming the fees (1) prevails on\r\nits breach of contract claim and (2) recovers damages.  <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.\r\nCode Ann. § 38.002; <em>Solis</em>, 951 S.W.2d at 390.  Haden and the company provided no\r\nsummary-judgment evidence showing that they could recover the damages they have\r\nasserted for breach of contract.<sup> (15)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaden asserted that: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t. . . it is undisputed that David Sacks performed <strong>some\r\n</strong>services for HADEN.  However, HADEN agreed to hire a\r\nboard certified, appellate specialist with 12 years[']\r\nexperience to handle his appeal--not inexperienced\r\nassociates with fewer than 2 years of experience between\r\nthem.  HADEN would never have hired SACKS to\r\nrepresent him had he known that nearly 90% of the work on\r\nthis appeal would be done by lawyers whose inexperience\r\nwould result in their requiring nearly 200 hours to complete\r\nthe work.  HADEN did not agree to pay a fee which would\r\nsupport this many hours of work nor did he agree to provide\r\nan opportunity for new appellate lawyers to learn their\r\ntrade.  HADEN believed he was hiring David J. Sacks,\r\nBoard Certified Appellate Specialist to do most, if not all,\r\nof the work on his appeal for a certain fee.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>(All emphasis in original.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe law firm contends that, because the agreement plainly provides that\r\ndifferent lawyers in the law firm would provide legal services to Haden and the\r\ncompany, no breach of contract occurred.  The law firm further contends that Haden's\r\naffidavit \"constitutes no evidence and cannot be considered\" because \"Haden cannot\r\nintroduce this parol evidence to vary the terms of the contract between the Law Firm\r\nand Haden.\"  The supreme court has approved this reasoning in reinstating the\r\nsummary judgment rendered on the law firm's breach-of-contract claim.  <em>See Sacks</em>,\r\n266 S.W.3d at 451.  We therefore reject Haden's and the company reliance on Haden's\r\naffidavit to create a triable issue of fact to support a claim for breach of contract by\r\nhim and the company by varying the terms of their fee agreement with the law firm. \r\n<em>See id</em>.; <em>Messer v.

This disposition effectively reinstated\r\nthe interlocutory summary judgment rendered in favor of the law firm in the amount\r\nof $30,314.38 plus interest.

The record, however, does not suggest \r\nthat either statute affected the trial court's reasoning in rendering summary judgment. \r\nAccordingly, our analysis may not encompass these additional statutory provisions.\r\n<em>See</em> Tex.

At oral submission of this case, counsel for Haden and the company directed us to two\r\nrecent opinions of the Supreme Court of Texas, each of which resulted in judgments\r\nof remand for a new trial to determine the amount of attorney's fees.  <em>See Young v.\r\nQualls</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894856\"><a href=\"/opinion/894856/young-v-qualls/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (Tex. 2007); <em>Barker v.

More importantly, though each addressed disparity\r\nbetween the damages awarded and the attorney's fees awarded, the disparity arose\r\nfrom the appellate court's having suggested a remittitur of damages award on which\r\nthe award of attorney's fees was based.  <em>See Young</em>, 223 S.W.3d at 314; <em>Barker</em>, 213\r\nS.W.3d at 314.  There is no possibility of remittitur here because the $30,314.38\r\ndamages awarded by the trial court derives from the summary judgment rendered in\r\nfavor of the law firm, which the supreme has recently affirmed.  <em>See Sacks</em>, 266\r\nS.W.3d at 450.\r\n</p><p>8. We also distinguish <em>Rasmusson v.

In the case before\r\nus, the law firm did not request a specific award of costs in seeking summary\r\njudgment, Sacks's affidavit does not specify an amount of costs, and the final\r\njudgment does not award a specific amount of costs.  Moreover, <em>Rasmusson</em> was not\r\ndecided pursuant to chapter 38 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.  \r\n</p><p>9. </p></span><span>Because the trial court rendered the summary judgment on the counterclaims early in\r\nthe case, the judgment was interlocutory until it became merged with the final\r\njudgment from which Haden and the company appeal.  <em>See City of Houston v. Socony\r\nMobil Oil Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1526334\"><a href=\"/opinion/1526334/city-of-houston-v-socony-mobil-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 430 (Tex.

R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\r\n<p>11. Haden and the company stated, as follows:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tHADEN has been damaged.  HADEN has been sued under a contract which\r\nhe did not make, <em>has been forced to hire an attorney to defend him in that\r\nlawsuit</em>, <em>and may have to pay excess fees incurred</em> when SACKS did not do the\r\nwork but shuffled it off to an inexperienced, unprepared associate with less\r\nthan three months experience who spent an inordinate amount of time on the\r\nproject.  As a result, <em>the fees over which this lawsuit was filed are higher than\r\nthe amount of money provided in the contract between the parties.</em>  It is\r\ndifficult to imagine that such a project would require the same amount of time\r\nby an attorney with twelve years['] experience as it would with three months[']\r\nexperience.<strong>  </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>(Italicized emphasis added; uppercase emphasis in original).  \r\n<p>12. The affidavit by Haden states, as follows:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t. . . Based on Mr. Sacks representative [sic] as an appellate expert, I\r\nhired Mr. Sacks to put an edge on my trial lawyer's brief.  At the outset\r\nof the engagement, I indicated that all I could pay was $5,000 for the\r\nwork he proposed[,] and he said it could be as high as $10,000. \r\nBelieving I was obtaining the services of an experienced appellate\r\nexpert, I agreed to have Mr. Sacks do the work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\tInitially, Mr. Sacks asked me to pay $10,000 to him and he who [sic]\r\nwould bill his charges against the deposit.  After discussing why all I\r\nwas willing to pay him was $5,000, Mr. Sacks and I agreed that I could\r\ngive him $5,000 to assist in the writing of the brief.  At no time, or\r\nunder any circumstances, did I agree to pay Mr. Sacks more than\r\n$10,000 for the work he proposed to do for me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tOn or about September 15, 1997, I received a statement from Mr. Sacks which\r\nindicated an outstanding balance of more than $37,000.  Mr. Sacks never\r\ncontacted me prior to my receiving the bill to say that the project was going to\r\nbe more expensive than we originally believed or to indicate that he would be\r\nunable to do a substantial portion of the work on the brief himself.  When I\r\nreviewed the bill I was surprised to discover that the vast majority of the work\r\non the brief had been done, not by Mr. Sacks, but by two other attorneys in his\r\nfirm.  I subsequently learned that they were young associates with fewer than\r\ntwo years['] experience between them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tFurther perusal of the bill revealed that one of the attorneys had billed\r\n161.75 hours to my case and Sacks had only billed 28 hours.  I learned\r\nthat Kathleen Peterson nee'[sic] Hoekstra had only been practicing\r\nthree months when working on my appeal.  It was clear to me that the\r\nsize of the bill was directly related to the inexperience of the attorney\r\ndoing most of the work.\r\n<p>13. For the first time on appeal, Haden and the company assert fee forfeiture as a ground\r\nfor damages on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.  We may not address this\r\ncontention because it was never presented to the trial court.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n166a(c).\r\n</p><p>14. For the first time on appeal, Haden and the company contend that if Sacks had\r\nperformed the work himself rather than giving the work to associates, the odds of\r\nobtaining a  reversal and retrial would have significantly increased.  Haden and the\r\ncompany did not present that argument to the trial court in support of their claim for\r\ndamages and presented no summary judgment evidence to support the argument.  \r\n</p><p>15. As the preceding analysis demonstrates, Haden and the company did not prevail. \r\nWhen the trial court rendered summary judgment on their counterclaims, however,\r\nthe summary judgment was interlocutory and not yet final.  Because the trial court had\r\nnot yet determined who would ultimately prevail, it could not have rendered summary\r\njudgment on the ground that Haden and the company did not prevail.  \r\n</p><p>16. Justice Sam Nuchia, who retired from the First Court of Appeals on January 1, 2009,\r\ncontinues to sit by assignment for the disposition of this case, which was submitted\r\non December 16, 2008.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
