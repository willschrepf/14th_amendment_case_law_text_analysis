Const. art. VI, § 10.\n\f                         UNPUBLISHED OPINION\n\nSMITH, TRACY M., Judge\n\n       Appellant-husband Kraig Rucker challenges an Olmsted County District Court’s\n\njudgment in the marriage-dissolution proceeding between appellant and respondent-wife\n\nKathleen Rucker. Appellant argues on appeal that the district court (1) abused its discretion\n\nby granting sole physical and sole legal custody of the parties’ children to respondent and\n\nlimiting his parenting time; (2) abused its discretion by denying appellant a downward\n\ndeviation from the presumptively appropriate guideline child-support obligation;\n\n(3) abused its discretion by denying appellant spousal maintenance; (4) abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying appellant’s nonmarital-property claim; and (5) erred in construing\n\nan in vitro fertilization consent form to award respondent the parties’ cryopreserved\n\nembryos. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion as alleged by\n\nappellant in his arguments (1)-(4). With respect to argument (5), because we conclude that\n\nthe district court erred in interpreting the consent form, we reverse and remand. We\n\ntherefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       Appellant and respondent married in August 1998. They have two children, G.R.\n\nand M.R, ages 13 and 6 at the time of dissolution. Respondent filed a petition for\n\ndissolution of marriage in August 2014. The parties physically separated in September\n\n2014 when respondent moved out of the marital home.\n\n       When respondent left the marital home, she transferred the parties’ money,\n\nincluding money appellant had inherited from his father, from a marital joint bank account\n\n\n                                             2\n\finto her personal bank account. At trial, appellant’s financial expert testified that appellant\n\nhad $35,379 in nonmarital funds in the joint bank account on August 1, 2014. Respondent\n\ntestified that she used the withdrawn funds to pay the parties’ mortgage, property taxes,\n\nhome loan, and other marital expenses. Financial records show that from August 1, 2014,\n\nto the valuation date of June 2, 2015, money was transferred between the joint bank account\n\nand respondent’s individual account on multiple occasions. Both parties continued to\n\ndeposit paychecks in the joint bank account until respondent switched to using a personal\n\nbank account and, eventually, closed the joint bank account.\n\n       During the pendency of the proceeding, the parties shared custody of their children.\n\nRespondent requested sole physical and sole legal custody of G.R. and M.R. Appellant\n\nrequested joint physical and joint legal custody and a 50/50 parenting-time arrangement.\n\nThe district court ordered a neutral custody evaluation. In her report, the custody evaluator\n\nexpressed concerns that appellant’s negative behavior toward respondent in front of the\n\nchildren would result in the children becoming alienated from respondent. The evaluator\n\nrecommended that respondent be granted sole legal and sole physical custody.\n\n       Both appellant and respondent, as well as G.R. and M.R., began attending\n\ncounseling after the separation. Appellant was unable to participate in therapy sessions\n\nwith respondent and her therapist because he “verbally exploded and then left [the\n\ntherapist’s] office.” Concerned about respondent’s safety, her therapist advised her to “go\n\nto a Women’s Shelter for that evening and not go home.” Counselors who worked with\n\nappellant and respondent believed that appellant was unaware of his “controlling” behavior\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fand observed that he failed to cooperate in therapy sessions. Both children’s therapists\n\nfound the children “unusually” aligned with appellant.\n\n       Since the separation, appellant has been a “negative influence” on the children.\n\nAppellant used the children as “spies in [respondent’s] home.” Appellant used phone calls\n\nwith the children to sing songs about lost love to the children while they were with\n\nrespondent. Appellant told the children that divorce is a sin and people who get divorced\n\ngo to hell. According to the custody evaluator, appellant’s actions have caused the children\n\nto “internalize[] their father’s perspective and beliefs, and see their mother as the cause of\n\ntheir father’s sadness and anger. Consequently the children are rejecting of their mother\n\nand most things associated with her.”\n\n       During the pendency of the proceeding, appellant began harassing respondent by\n\nphone; text message; and Our Family Wizard, a phone application designed to help\n\nestranged parents communicate about their children. Respondent obtained a harassment\n\nrestraining order against appellant in December 2014. The district court found that\n\nappellant had stalked respondent; gone to her home uninvited; harassed her by phone, text,\n\ne-mail, and Our Family Wizard multiple times a day; and made her feel threatened.\n\n       Following six days of trial, the district court issued its findings of fact, conclusions\n\nof law, order for judgment, and judgment and decree in February 2016. With respect to\n\nchild custody, the district court analyzed the 12 best-interests factors under Minn. Stat.\n\n§ 518.17 (Supp. 2015), and at the end of each discussion noted whether the factor weighed\n\nin favor of appellant or respondent or was “neutral.” The district court granted respondent\n\nsole physical and sole legal custody of the children. The district court limited appellant’s\n\n\n                                              4\n\fparenting time to every other weekend and every Thursday evening, with additional\n\nparenting time in the summer, for vacation, and on holidays.\n\n       For purposes of child support and spousal maintenance, the district court found that\n\nrespondent has a gross monthly income of $5,315.83 and a claimed monthly budget of\n\n$5,636.67. The court found that appellant has a gross monthly income of $5,764.03 and a\n\nclaimed monthly budget of $6,483.55, but his “reasonable expenses do not exceed $3,000”\n\nafter the payment of child support and taxes. The court awarded respondent $1,335 in child\n\nsupport, including daycare and insurance expenses, and denied appellant’s request for\n\nspousal maintenance. The district court also concluded that appellant failed to establish\n\nthat respondent owed him $35,379 in nonmarital property based on her transfer of funds\n\nfrom their joint bank account to her personal bank account. Furthermore, the court\n\nconcluded that there was no credible evidence indicating that respondent had done anything\n\nimpermissible with the funds from the joint bank account because the funds had been used\n\nto pay marital expenses.\n\n       Finally, the district court awarded respondent the parties’ two cryopreserved\n\nembryos, which have been stored at Mayo Clinic since May 2008. The district court\n\nconcluded that the Mayo Clinic consent form signed by both appellant and respondent is a\n\nbinding contract that controls the disposition of the embryos and interpreted the language\n\nof the consent form to assign the property rights to the embryos to respondent in the event\n\nof divorce.\n\n       Appellant filed a posttrial motion arguing that the district court did not properly\n\nweigh the best interests of the children, should have awarded appellant spousal\n\n\n                                            5\n\fmaintenance and granted a downward deviation from the presumptively appropriate child-\n\nsupport obligation, and misconstrued the in vitro fertilization consent form. The district\n\ncourt rejected all of appellant’s arguments but stayed the disposition of the embryos.\n\n       This appeal follows.\n\n                                          DECISION\n\nI.     The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting respondent sole\n       physical and sole legal custody of the children and limiting appellant’s\n       parenting time.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting respondent\n\nsole physical and sole legal custody of their children and limiting his parenting time. We\n\nreview the district court’s custody and parenting-time determinations for “whether the\n\n[district] court abused its discretion by making findings unsupported by the evidence or by\n\nimproperly applying the law.” Pikula v. Pikula, 374 N.W.2d 705, 710 (Minn. 1985); see\n\nHagens v. Schirmers, 783 N.W.2d 212, 215 (Minn. App. 2010). The law “leaves scant if\n\nany room for an appellate court to question the [district] court’s balancing of best-interests\n\nconsiderations.” Vangsness v. Vangsness, 607 N.W.2d 468, 477 (Minn. App. 2000). We\n\nsustain a district court’s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Pikula,\n\n374 N.W.2d at 710. We also defer to a district court’s credibility determinations. Sefkow\n\nv. Sefkow, 427 N.W.2d 203, 210 (Minn. 1988).\n\n       The best interests of the child are central to determining issues of physical and legal\n\ncustody and parenting time. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(a). Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd.\n\n1(a)(1)-(12), lists 12 factors to be considered in evaluating the best interests of the child.\n\nId. The statute requires the district court to make “detailed” factual findings for each factor,\n\n\n                                               6\n\fexplaining how each factor led to its conclusion, and prohibits the court from using “one\n\nfactor to the exclusion of all others.” Id., subd. 1(b)(1). The statute also requires the use\n\nof a rebuttable presumption that joint legal custody is in the best interests of a child if joint\n\nlegal custody is requested by a parent. Id., subd. 1(b)(9). The statute, however, provides\n\nfor no presumption regarding joint physical custody. See id., subd. 1(b)(7).1\n\n       A. The district court did not abuse its discretion by making shorthand\n          summaries of its findings.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to comply\n\nwith the child-centered analysis required by section 518.17 because it was inappropriate\n\nfor the district court to indicate whether each factor weighed in favor of appellant or\n\nrespondent or was neutral. Appellant contends that the district court conducted a parent-\n\ncentered analysis and that the district court’s conclusions failed to take into account the\n\npresumption that joint legal custody is in the best interests of the children.\n\n       The statute requires the district court to\n\n              make detailed findings on each of the factors in paragraph (a)\n              based on the evidence presented and explain how each factor\n              led to its conclusions and to the determination of custody and\n              parenting time. The court may not use one factor to the\n              exclusion of all others, and the court shall consider that the\n              factors may be interrelated.\n\nMinn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(b)(1). The district court’s analysis of the best-interests\n\nfactors, which used a shorthand to indicate that a factor favored “Father” or “Mother” or\n\n\n\n1\n The statute establishes a presumption against joint legal and joint physical custody in the\ncase of domestic abuse, which is not an issue in this case. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd.\n1(b)(9).\n\n                                               7\n\fwas “neutral,” is not inconsistent with the statute. See id., subd. 1(a)(1)-(12). The district\n\ncourt wrote 32 pages of factual findings on child custody, thoroughly weighed the\n\nevidence, and explained how this evidence led to its conclusions. Read in its entirety, the\n\ndistrict court’s analysis is child centered and explains why the court decided that joint legal\n\nand joint physical custody are not in the best interests of the children. The district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by making its shorthand summaries because the district court\n\ncomplied with the statute by making thorough findings of fact and explaining how these\n\nfindings led to its conclusions. See id., subd. 1(b)(1).\n\n       B. The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting respondent sole\n          physical custody and limiting appellant’s parenting time.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting respondent\n\nsole physical custody of the children and limiting his parenting time.\n\n       The district court found that the factors related to the children’s physical, emotional,\n\ncultural, spiritual, and other needs; the children’s special medical, mental-health, or\n\neducational needs; any physical, mental, or chemical-health issue of a parent that affects\n\nthe child’s safety or developmental needs; the willingness and ability of each parent to\n\nprovide ongoing care and meet the children’s ongoing needs; the effect of the proposed\n\ncustodial arrangement on the children’s ongoing relationships; the benefit to the children\n\nof maximizing parenting time with both parents and the detriment of limiting time with\n\neither parent; the disposition of each parent to support the child’s relationship with the\n\nother parent; and the willingness and ability of the parents to cooperate in rearing the child\n\neach weighed in favor of respondent. See id., subd. 1(a)(1)-(2), (5), (7), (9)-(12). The\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fdistrict court found that the factor related to the effect on the children’s well-being of\n\nchanges to the home, school, and community weighed in favor of appellant. See id., subd.\n\n1(a)(8). Finally, the district court found that the remaining factors were neutral and did not\n\nweigh in favor of either party. See id., subd. 1(a)(3)-(4), (6).\n\n       Regardless of appellant’s complaints about the district court’s shorthand for\n\nsummarizing its findings, the district court fully explained its best-interest findings, and\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the findings. Early in the separation, respondent obtained a\n\nharassment restraining order against appellant. The record shows that appellant was unable\n\nto participate in therapy sessions with respondent’s therapist because he “verbally exploded\n\nand then left [the therapist’s] office.” The record also shows that multiple counselors who\n\nworked with appellant and respondent believed appellant was unaware of his “controlling”\n\nbehavior and failed to cooperate in therapy sessions.\n\n       The district court found that appellant “places the children in the middle of adult\n\nissues” and attempts to undermine the children’s relationship with respondent. Both of the\n\nchildren’s therapists found them “unusually” aligned with appellant.             The record\n\ndemonstrates that appellant used G.R. to obtain information about respondent.             For\n\nexample, he sent text messages to respondent, stating, “[G.R.] will keep me posted on any\n\nplans you may be making as far as vacations so deception will not be an option any longer.”\n\nThe record also shows that appellant competed with respondent in parenting the children.\n\nFor example, appellant messaged respondent that he would ensure the Tooth Fairy\n\n“make[s] a second stop at the place she does call home” and would ensure “this visit trumps\n\nall previous ones and makes a lasting impression.” Appellant used phone calls to sing\n\n\n                                              9\n\finappropriate songs to the children while they were with respondent. Appellant told the\n\nchildren that divorce was a sin, and that people who get divorced go to hell, and he prayed\n\nwith the children for respondent to return to the marriage. The independent custody\n\nevaluator expressed concerns that appellant’s negative behavior would result in the\n\nchildren becoming alienated from respondent.\n\n       In Henrikson v. Henrikson, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that the “voluminous\n\nrecord of testimony and exhibits” supported the district court’s conclusion that “a change\n\nof custody was necessary to thwart a manifest purpose of plaintiff and her present husband\n\nto alienate the children from the affection and influence of their father.” 288 Minn. 532,\n\n533, 179 N.W.2d 284, 285 (1970). While this case involves an initial grant of custody, we\n\nbelieve that the circumstances of this case are sufficiently analogous to Henrikson that\n\nHenrikson can provide guidance here. Id. In particular, here, the district court found that\n\nappellant “is unable to allow the children, especially [G.R.,] to love both parents without\n\nguilt or disapproval.”\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting sole physical custody to\n\nrespondent and limiting appellant’s parenting time because substantial evidence supports\n\nits best-interests findings.2 See Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(a)(1)-(12).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Usually, custody and parenting time involve separate analyses under separate statutes.\nSee Minn. Stat. § 518.17 (describing the custody analysis); Minn. Stat. § 518.175 (Supp.\n2015) (describing the parenting-time analysis). Appellant consolidated these issues into a\nsingle argument, focusing on the child-custody issue. Appellant has argued neither that his\nparenting time is being “restricted” nor that he was not granted the presumptively\nappropriate 25% parenting time. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(b), (g).\n\n                                             10\n\f       C. The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting respondent sole\n          legal custody.\n\n       Appellant challenges the district court’s determination that respondent had\n\nproduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that joint legal custody is in the best\n\ninterests of the children. The district court stated that it used the rebuttable presumption in\n\nevaluating whether joint legal custody is in the best interests of the children but ultimately\n\ngranted sole legal custody to respondent.\n\n       Section 518.003 defines “[j]oint legal custody” to mean “both parents have equal\n\nrights and responsibilities, including the right to participate in major decisions determining\n\nthe child’s upbringing, including education, health care, and religious training.” Minn.\n\nStat. § 518.003, subd. 3(b) (2014). When one parent has requested joint legal custody,\n\nsection 518.17 instructs the district court to use a rebuttable presumption that joint legal\n\ncustody is in the best interests of the child. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(b)(9).\n\n       We have held that joint legal custody is inappropriate where “the evidence indicates\n\nthat the parties lack the ability to cooperate and communicate.” Wopata v. Wopata,\n\n498 N.W.2d 478, 482 (Minn. App. 1993). In Wopata, we reversed a district court’s\n\ndecision to grant joint legal custody where the parties were unable to cooperate and each\n\n“use[d] the children as a weapon against the other.” Id. In Digatono v. Digatono, we\n\nconcluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying joint legal custody\n\nwhere the parties’ relationship was “intense” and “any significant contact between the\n\nparties [was] likely to result in further tension, and may in fact result in physical\n\nconfrontations.” 414 N.W.2d 498, 502 (Minn. App. 1987), review denied (Minn. Jan. 15,\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f1988). In Heard v. Heard, we reversed the district court’s decision to grant joint legal\n\ncustody where “negotiations even on such matters as telephone calls by the children\n\nsometimes resulted in abusive behavior.” 353 N.W.2d 157, 161-62 (Minn. App. 1984).\n\n       The district court’s grant of sole legal custody to respondent is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence that respondent and appellant lack the ability to cooperate on a level\n\nthat would permit joint legal custody. The facts of this case are analogous to those in\n\nWopata, Digatono, and Heard because appellant is unable to communicate with respondent\n\nwithout becoming upset over their relationship and additional communication is likely to\n\nresult in further tension between the parties. While not necessarily dispositive on the\n\nsubject, we note that appellant’s behavior toward respondent even led to a harassment\n\nrestraining order against appellant.\n\n       Appellant contends that both parents have agreed on and participated in the\n\nchildren’s “education, health care, and religious training” and therefore the court had no\n\nbasis for ruling that the presumption had been overcome. The statute lists the children’s\n\n“physical, emotional, cultural, spiritual, and other needs” as relevant in determining their\n\nbest interests. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(a)(1). The district court, however, “may not\n\nuse one factor to the exclusion of all others, and the court shall consider that the factors\n\nmay be interrelated.” Id., subd. 1(b)(1). While the district court found that both parties are\n\nable to address the children’s needs in these areas, it also found that appellant “fails to have\n\nmeaningful insight into his behavior and negative impact upon [the] children.” Appellant\n\npresents no caselaw in which the parents’ current agreement on the children’s education,\n\nhealth care, and religious training was enough to require joint legal custody where the\n\n\n                                              12\n\fparents were otherwise unable to cooperate. We affirm the district court’s determination\n\nthat respondent presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of joint legal\n\ncustody and its granting of sole legal custody to respondent. Id.\n\nII.    The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant a downward\n       deviation from the presumptively appropriate guideline child-support\n       obligation.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant him\n\na downward deviation from the presumptively appropriate guideline child-support\n\nobligation. He asserts that he cannot meet his reasonable monthly expenses. The district\n\ncourt found that appellant is capable of “being self-supporting” and that his reasonable\n\nexpenses after child support and taxes “do not exceed $3,000 per month.” The district\n\ncourt concluded that, under the child-support guidelines, appellant’s presumptively\n\nappropriate guideline basic support obligation is $1,042 per month and ordered him to pay\n\nthat amount plus childcare support and medical support, for a total of $1,335 per month.\n\n       This court reviews the calculation of child support for an abuse of discretion. Rutten\n\nv. Rutten, 347 N.W.2d 47, 50 (Minn. 1984). The district court has broad discretion in\n\nawarding child support, and this court will reverse the district court only if it is convinced\n\nthat the district court resolved the matter in a manner “against logic and the facts on\n\nrecord.” Putz v. Putz, 645 N.W.2d 343, 347 (Minn. 2002). This court reviews a district\n\ncourt’s determination of the parties’ incomes and budgets for clear error. Newstrand v.\n\nArend, 869 N.W.2d 681, 685 (Minn. App. 2015), review denied (Minn. Dec. 15, 2015).\n\n       The parents’ gross income is only the starting point for the child-support analysis.\n\nHaefele v. Haefele, 837 N.W.2d 703, 714 (Minn. 2013). The party who requests a deviation\n\n\n                                             13\n\ffrom the child-support guidelines bears the burden of producing evidence “that would merit\n\na deviation.” Bunge v. Zachman, 578 N.W.2d 387, 390 (Minn. App. 1998), review denied\n\n(Minn. July 30, 1998). In considering whether to deviate from the child-support guidelines,\n\nthe statute lists a number of factors for consideration:\n\n               (1)    all earnings, income, circumstances, and resources of\n               each parent, including real and personal property . . . ;\n               (2)    the extraordinary financial needs and resources,\n               physical and emotional condition, and educational needs of the\n               child to be supported;\n               (3)    the standard of living the child would enjoy if the\n               parents were currently living together, but recognizing that the\n               parents now have separate households . . . ;\n               (6)    the parents’ debts as provided in subdivision 2 . . . .\n\nMinn. Stat. § 518A.43, subd. 1 (Supp. 2015). In order to deviate from the statutory\n\nguidelines, the district court must make written findings articulating, among other things,\n\n“how the deviation serves the best interests of the child.” Minn. Stat. § 518A.37, subd.\n\n2(5) (2014).\n\n       We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\nappellant’s request for a downward deviation in child support. While the district court\n\nlisted appellant’s claimed monthly budget of $6,483.55 in its findings, the district court\n\nnevertheless found that appellant’s reasonable expenses do not exceed $3,000 after taxes\n\nand child support. The district court did not explain its departure from appellant’s budget,\n\nbut appellant has not shown that the district court’s calculations are so clearly erroneous as\n\nto warrant reversal.    See Fletcher v. St. Paul Pioneer Press, 589 N.W.2d 96, 101\n\n(Minn. 1999) (“Findings of fact are clearly erroneous only if the reviewing court is left\n\nwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.” (quotation omitted)).\n\n\n                                             14\n\fAppellant’s financial expert testified that appellant’s budget would be lower without joint\n\ncustody. The district court found that both parties are able to reduce their expenses and\n\n“will need to budget like most couples after a dissolution.” The district court also found\n\nthat appellant earns more than respondent and respondent will be supporting two children.\n\nWith child support, respondent could meet her new budget, which the district court\n\nimplicitly found is in the best interests of the children.\n\n       The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant a\n\ndownward deviation in child support. Putz, 645 N.W.2d at 347.\n\nIII.   The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant spousal\n       maintenance.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to award him\n\nspousal maintenance to offset his child-support obligations. We review the decision to\n\ngrant or deny spousal maintenance for an abuse of discretion. Dobrin v. Dobrin, 569\n\nN.W.2d 199, 202 (Minn. 1997). A district court abuses it discretion if its findings of fact\n\nare unsupported by the record or if it improperly applies the law. Id. Factual findings\n\nconcerning spousal maintenance are upheld unless they are clearly erroneous. Gessner v.\n\nGessner, 487 N.W.2d 921, 923 (Minn. App. 1992). The determination of income for\n\nmaintenance purposes is a finding of fact and is not set aside unless clearly erroneous.\n\nPeterka v. Peterka, 675 N.W.2d 353, 357 (Minn. App. 2004).\n\n       A district court may award spousal maintenance upon finding that the party seeking\n\nmaintenance “lacks sufficient property . . . to provide for reasonable needs of the spouse\n\nconsidering the standard of living established during the marriage” or “is unable to provide\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fadequate self-support, after considering the standard of living established during the\n\nmarriage and all relevant circumstances, through appropriate employment.” Minn. Stat.\n\n§ 518.552, subd. 1(a)-(b) (2014). The district court concluded that there is no statutory\n\nbasis to award appellant spousal maintenance.\n\n        We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant\n\nspousal maintenance. The district court determined that both parties “earn approximately\n\n$5000 gross income per month” and “lived a moderate life style,” and that appellant has\n\n“the ability to meet his own needs independently and has sufficient education and training\n\nfor appropriate employment” to adequately support himself. Minn. Stat. § 518.552, subd.\n\n1(b).   Even appellant’s financial expert testified, “[I]n many cases when you have\n\nhouseholds that are splitting, the expenses may be more than what the available income\n\nis.” Appellant is also not the custodian of a child “whose condition or circumstances make\n\nit appropriate that the custodian not be required to seek employment outside the home.”\n\nId. No statutory ground supports appellant’s request for spousal maintenance.\n\n        Moreover, if the district court believed appellant could not meet his child-support\n\nobligations, it could deviate from the child-support guidelines—not award appellant\n\nspousal maintenance to enable him to pay child support. Minn. Stat. § 518A.43, subd. 1.\n\n        We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\nappellant spousal maintenance. Minn. Stat. § 518.552, subd. 1(a)-(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fIV.    The district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting appellant’s\n       nonmarital property claim.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court erred by failing to reduce respondent’s share\n\nof the property equalizer by $35,379 for appellant’s nonmarital property that respondent\n\ntransferred to her personal bank account after the parties’ separation. The district court\n\nconcluded that appellant failed to prove his nonmarital claim and that no credible evidence\n\nshows that respondent used these funds for inappropriate purposes.\n\n       We evaluate the division of property for an abuse of discretion. Antone v. Antone,\n\n645 N.W.2d 96, 100 (Minn. 2002). “Whether property is marital or nonmarital is a question\n\nof law, but a reviewing court must defer to the [district] court’s underlying findings of\n\nfact.” Olsen v. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d 797, 800 (Minn. 1997). A district court’s findings of\n\nfact will not be set aside unless those findings are clearly erroneous. Maurer v. Maurer,\n\n623 N.W.2d 604, 606 (Minn. 2001).           We defer to the district court’s credibility\n\ndeterminations. Vangsness, 607 N.W.2d at 472.\n\n       With certain exceptions, marital property includes all property acquired by either\n\nspouse during their marriage and before the valuation date. Minn. Stat. § 518.003, subd.\n\n3b (2014). As a result, “[a]ll property acquired by either spouse during the marriage is\n\npresumptively marital, but a spouse may defeat the presumption by showing by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the property acquired is nonmarital.” Risk ex rel. Miller\n\nv. Stark, 787 N.W.2d 690, 696 (Minn. App. 2010) (quotation omitted), review denied\n\n(Minn. Nov. 16, 2010). Under one exception to the general rule that property acquired\n\nduring a marriage and before the valuation date is marital, property acquired during a\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fmarriage and before the valuation date that is “acquired as . . . inheritance made by a third\n\nparty to one but not to the other spouse” is nonmarital property. Minn. Stat. § 518.003,\n\nsubd. 3b(a). Under another exception, property “acquired in exchange for” otherwise\n\nnonmarital property is also nonmarital property. Id., subd. 3b(c).\n\n       To maintain its nonmarital character, nonmarital property must “either be kept\n\nseparate from marital property or, if commingled with marital property, be readily\n\ntraceable.” Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800. “[T]racing property to its nonmarital sources does\n\nnot require intricate detail.” Stark, 787 N.W.2d at 697. Simply routing funds through a\n\njoint bank account “does not transform non-marital property into marital property.” Nash\n\nv. Nash, 388 N.W.2d 777, 781 (Minn. App. 1986) (quotation omitted), review denied\n\n(Minn. Aug. 20, 1986). “Whether a nonmarital interest has been traced is . . . a question\n\nof fact.” Kerr v. Kerr, 770 N.W.2d 567, 571 (Minn. App. 2009).\n\n       Neither party disputes on appeal that appellant inherited $35,379 in 2013 and that\n\nthe funds that respondent withdrew from the parties’ joint bank account included\n\nappellant’s inherited funds. Property obtained from an inheritance is nonmarital property.\n\nMinn. Stat. § 518.003, subd. 3b(a). But appellant commingled his property with marital\n\nproperty in the joint bank account. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800. In order to prove its\n\nnonmarital character, appellant must trace the property and show by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that the property is nonmarital. Stark, 787 N.W.2d at 697.\n\n       On this record, we conclude that the district court’s implicit finding that appellant\n\nfailed to trace his nonmarital property is not clearly erroneous. Kerr, 770 N.W.2d at 569.\n\nThis is not a simple case of routing funds through a joint bank account.               Nash,\n\n\n                                             18\n\f388 N.W.2d at 781. After respondent withdrew the funds, both marital and nonmarital\n\nproperty was transferred back to the joint bank account for the payment of expenses.\n\nAppellant’s expert testified that there was “a fair account of activity, but I don’t know the\n\nnature of how they segregated or designated funds to be spent.” The record supports the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that appellant used funds from her account to pay marital expenses,\n\nincluding loans and utilities for the marital home, and the funds from her account included\n\nboth appellant’s nonmarital inheritance and other, marital, funds. Thus, the funds in the\n\naccount from which the marital expenses were paid were commingled funds. And when\n\nfunds are commingled, the burden is on the party claiming a nonmarital interest to trace\n\nthat alleged nonmarital interest to specific property. Crosby v. Crosby, 587 N.W.2d 292,\n\n296-97 (Minn. App. 1998) (finding that appellant failed to trace claimed nonmarital\n\ninterests in a case in which funds were commingled and appellant only showed her funds\n\nwere the “primary source” for acquiring certain assets), review denied (Minn. Feb. 18,\n\n1999). On this record, however, appellant failed to identify any particular property\n\nacquired “in exchange for” the funds from his otherwise nonmarital inheritance. Therefore,\n\nappellant has not adequately traced his asserted nonmarital interests. See Pettit v. Pettit,\n\n472 N.W.2d 668, 670 (Minn. App. 1991) (concluding that while the party had traced certain\n\nfunds to a nonmarital inheritance, the party failed to trace those funds into any property\n\nacquired in exchange for the funds, and therefore that the district court had erred by\n\ngranting that party a nonmarital interest in the parties’ otherwise marital farm). As a result,\n\nappellant has not shown that the district court erred in treating the property acquired during\n\nthe marriage as marital property and dividing it accordingly. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800.\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Citing Stark, appellant argues that the burden shifted to respondent to show how she\n\nspent the money once appellant traced the funds to the joint bank account on August 1,\n\n2014. 787 N.W.2d at 690. We disagree. In Stark, the appellant withdrew $63,096.45—\n\n$52,636.59 of which was the respondent’s nonmarital property—from a joint money-\n\nmarket account, without the consent of the respondent, shortly before the respondent\n\ncommenced marriage-dissolution proceedings. Id. at 697-98. This court first reviewed the\n\ndistrict court’s decision regarding whether the respondent met her burden of showing by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the withdrawn money had a nonmarital source. Id. at\n\n696-98. Having concluded that the record supported the district court’s determination that\n\nthe funds in question had a nonmarital source, the court then concluded that sufficient\n\nevidence supported the district court’s finding that the appellant had disposed of those\n\nfunds without respondent’s consent. Id. at 698. Stark, however, does not suggest that the\n\nburden of proof shifts from a party alleging wrongful disposition of property to the other\n\nparty once a nonmarital source for that property has been identified.\n\n       This case is distinguishable from Stark because appellant commingled his\n\nnonmarital property with the parties’ marital property before respondent withdrew those\n\nfunds, and respondent used those funds to pay the parties’ marital expenses after that time.\n\nIf appellant wished to preserve the nonmarital character of his inheritance, he could have\n\nkept it separate from the marital estate and traced it to the specific property existing when\n\nthe district court dissolved the marriage. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800.\n\n       Finally, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the district court’s finding\n\nthat respondent did not misuse marital property. Minn. Stat. § 518.58, subd. 1a. (2014),\n\n\n                                             20\n\fprovides that “[i]f the court finds that a party to a marriage, without consent of the other\n\nparty, has . . . transferred, encumbered, concealed, or disposed of marital assets except in\n\nthe usual course of business or for the necessities of life, the court shall compensate the\n\nother party.” By the time of valuation, respondent’s bank accounts did not contain $35,379;\n\nin other words, she did not retain the funds. The record shows that respondent handled the\n\nparties’ finances throughout the marriage. The record also shows that she used the\n\nwithdrawn marital property in the “usual course of business.” Respondent testified that\n\nappellant expected respondent to “pay all of his bills and [hers]” after she moved out of the\n\nhome. Respondent further testified that “[appellant] had been spending thousands of\n\ndollars on eBay and other places,” and respondent was concerned that appellant would\n\ninappropriately use an excessive amount of the money. Respondent used money that had\n\nderived from the parties’ joint bank account to pay the parties’ mortgage, property taxes,\n\nhome-equity loan, and other expenses. The personal account from which respondent paid\n\nexpenses also included her paychecks. The district court found no credible evidence that\n\nrespondent had inappropriately used the funds. We defer to this credibility determination.\n\nSefkow, 427 N.W.2d at 210. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nfinding that respondent had not misused the marital funds. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800.\n\n       Because appellant failed to properly trace his nonmarital claim and evidence\n\nsupports the finding that respondent did not misuse marital property, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant’s nonmarital claim and did\n\nnot otherwise abuse its discretion when it divided these assets. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fV.     The district court erred in awarding respondent the cryopreserved embryos.\n\n       Appellant challenges the district court’s award to respondent of the cryopreserved\n\nembryos. The district court’s award to respondent of the embryos is based on its reading\n\nof the form titled “Consent Regarding IVF Services.” That form was provided by the Mayo\n\nClinic and is signed by both parties, as well as on behalf of the Mayo Clinic. It includes a\n\ncheck-the-box section addressing what the Mayo Clinic is to do with the cryopreserved\n\nembryos in certain circumstances, including “[d]ivorce/separation.” For that circumstance,\n\nthe column labeled “[c]ontinue to [s]tore for transfer to female partner” is checked. In the\n\ndissolution judgment, the district court noted that respondent wants the embryos “awarded\n\nto her pursuant to the consent [form] so that she may elect to have the embryos destroyed\n\nin light of the dissolution of the parties’ marriage,”3 while appellant “wants the embryos\n\nawarded to him, [to] continue to be stored indefinitely, and he is willing to pay for\n\nstorage.”4 The district court ruled that the consent form “is a binding contract, enforceable\n\nby the court,” and, apparently based on the form’s reference to “transfer to female partner,”\n\nruled that “[t]he 2 remaining embryos shall be awarded to [respondent].” Appellant argues\n\nthat the “plain language” of the consent form requires that the embryos be stored.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  We express no opinion regarding whether respondent’s wish to “destroy[]” the embryos\nis consistent with the consent form’s statement that the embryos are to be “store[d]” for\n“transfer to the female partner.”\n4\n  We express no opinion regarding whether appellant’s wish to store the embryos\n“indefinitely” is consistent with the consent form’s statement that “[t]he maximum period”\nfor storage “is 10 years.”\n\n                                             22\n\f         When the terms of a contract are unambiguous, courts enforce the contract as\n\nwritten, absent an infirmity that would invalidate it. Brookfield Trade Ctr., Inc. v. Cty. of\n\nRamsey, 584 N.W.2d 390, 394 (Minn. 1998). “[W]hether a contract is ambiguous is a\n\nquestion of law, but the interpretation of an ambiguous contract is a question of fact for the\n\n[fact-finder].” Denelsbeck v. Wells Fargo & Co., 666 N.W.2d 339, 346 (Minn. 2003). “A\n\ncontract is ambiguous if, based upon its language alone, it is reasonably susceptible of more\n\nthan one interpretation.” Id. (quotation omitted). Here, we conclude that the consent\n\nform’s use of “transfer” in its check-the-box section unambiguously refers to placing the\n\nembryos in the female partner in an attempt to produce a pregnancy. Thus, because the\n\ndistrict court apparently based its award of the embryos to respondent on a reading of\n\n“transfer” to mean an assignment or conveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing\n\ntheir custodian or keeper, we conclude that the district court’s disposition of the embryos\n\nis based on an incorrect reading of the consent form, and we remand the question of the\n\ndisposition of the embryos to the district court.\n\n         A. Construction of the consent form\n\n         As noted, in the check-the-box section of the consent form, the column labeled\n\n“[c]ontinue to [s]tore for transfer to female partner” is checked for the circumstance of\n\n“[d]ivorce/separation.” The form also states:\n\n                In the majority of cases, more oocytes[5] are retrieved and\n                fertilized than may be necessary to achieve a pregnancy. When\n                this situation occurs, two options exist under the [Mayo Clinic\n                Assisted Reproductive Technology] program for the handling\n                of these extra fertilized oocytes.\n\n5\n    The consent form states that an “oocyte” is “a mature egg.”\n\n                                              23\n\f                      1.      Transfer the ideal number (presently thought to\n               be 2 to 3) of the fertilized oocytes and discard the remainder;\n\n                      2.      Transfer the ideal number of fertilized oocytes\n               and store the remaining fertilized oocytes by the process called\n               “cryopreservation.” Transfer of cryopreserved embryos after\n               an unsuccessful embryo transfer of fresh embryos improves the\n               overall chance for a successful pregnancy.\n\n               If at some time in the future a transfer is considered, the\n               fertilized oocytes will be thawed and examined. If it appears\n               that they are viable, the transfer will be undertaken.\n\nThe use of “transfer” in the portion of the form quoted above, particularly in item 2 and the\n\ntwo sentences following it, unambiguously (a) does not refer to an assignment or\n\nconveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing their custodian or keeper; and (b)\n\ndoes refer to using the embryos in an attempt to produce a pregnancy. See Stedman’s\n\nMedical Dictionary 1622 (25th ed. 1990) (noting that “transfer” in the context of artificial\n\ninsemination procedures refers to when, “after either in vitro or in vivo artificial\n\ninsemination, the fertilized ovum is transferred . . . to the recipient’s uterus.”).\n\n       Consistent with this produce-a-pregnancy sense of “transfer,” as well as the idea\n\nthat the “ideal” number of fertilized oocytes to be transferred in an attempt to produce a\n\npregnancy is two to three, a second part of the form identifies the “[n]umber [of fertilized\n\noocytes] for fresh transfer” as “2-3.” A third portion of the form states that the “[t]ype of\n\nfresh transfer” that is to occur for the parties is a transfer at the “[c]leavage stage” of oocyte\n\ndevelopment. And a fourth portion of the form notes that the Mayo Clinic “recommend[s]”\n\na process identified as “Assisted Hatching” for “multiple prior failed embryo transfers.”\n\nEach of these uses of “transfer” unambiguously refers to attempts to produce a pregnancy.\n\n\n                                               24\n\fA fifth section of the form, however, states, “You have the option of transferring your\n\nembryos from Mayo Clinic. It is your responsibility to make the arrangements for any\n\ntransfer.” This fifth section of the form uses “transfer” in a sense other than the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense. Thus, while the form generally seems to use “transfer” in the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense, that sense of “transfer” does not appear to be the only sense in which\n\nthat word is used in the form.\n\n       The crux of the parties’ dispute regarding construction of the form is whether\n\n“transfer,” as used in the check-the-box section of the form, refers to (a) an assignment or\n\nconveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing their custodian or keeper; or (b) using\n\nthe embryos in an attempt to produce a pregnancy. Here, for three reasons, we conclude\n\nthat the check-the-box section of the form unambiguously uses “transfer” in the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense. First, generally, unless context suggests otherwise, courts construing a\n\ncontract assume that a word in a contract has the same meaning throughout the contract.\n\nSee, e.g., Smitke v. Travelers Indem. Co., 264 Minn. 212, 214, 118 N.W.2d 217, 218 (1962)\n\n(construing “relative” to carry the same meaning throughout the entirety of the contract).\n\nAnd, as noted above, the majority of the uses of “transfer” in the form are in the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense of that term. Second, while the check-the-box section of the form allows\n\nstorage for transfer to the female partner, it lacks any indication that cryopreserved\n\nembryos can (ever) be “transferred” to the male partner. The lack of an option to transfer\n\nthe embryos to the male partner makes little sense if “transfer” merely refers to an\n\nassignment or conveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing their custodian or\n\nkeeper. Third, the check-the-box section of the form does not allow selection of the store-\n\n\n                                            25\n\ffor-transfer-to-the-female-partner option at the end of what the form identifies as the 10-\n\nyear maximum storage period for cryopreserved embryos, a prohibition making sense only\n\nif “transfer” is being used to refer to trying to produce a pregnancy. Thus, on this record,\n\nwe conclude that the district court’s reading of the form was incorrect, and that its\n\ndisposition of the cryopreserved embryos based on that reading must be remanded.\n\n       B. Other matters\n\n       Appellant makes several “alternative[]” arguments to challenge the district court’s\n\ndisposition of the embryos, including arguments questioning whether the disposition of\n\nembryos should be decided based on a contractual analysis. We need not address these\n\narguments because, based on the plain language of the consent form, we are reversing the\n\ndistrict court’s reading of that form and remanding for the district court to readdress the\n\ndisposition of the embryos. We note, however, that appellant’s alternative arguments are\n\nconsistent with questions raised by respondent in the district court, and that, while the\n\ndistrict court used a contractual analysis for addressing the disposition of the embryos, it\n\ndid not explain why it did so. As a result, it is unclear whether the district court’s use of\n\nthe contractual analysis is a considered choice, or simply an assumption that the contractual\n\nanalysis is a proper vehicle for addressing disposition of the embryos.\n\n       A district court’s failure to address why a particular result was reached (here, why\n\na contractual analysis was used to address disposition of the embryos) can limit the\n\nreviewability of the district court’s decision on the point. See Suleski v. Rupe, 855 N.W.2d\n\n330, 338 (Minn. App. 2014) (remanding a parenting schedule because, while the schedule\n\nwas clear, the district court failed to articulate its rationale for that schedule); In re Salah,\n\n\n                                               26\n\f629 N.W.2d 99, 104 (Minn. App. 2001) (remanding a custody dispute because the district\n\ncourt “failed to adequately explain its application of [the relevant law]”); see generally,\n\nThiele v. Stich, 425 N.W.2d 580, 582 (Minn. 1988) (stating that for a question to be\n\nproperly before an appellate court, that question must have been previously presented to\n\nand considered by the district court). Here, that limitation is exacerbated by the fact that\n\nthe disposition of the parties’ cryopreserved embryos is a question of first impression in\n\nMinnesota.\n\n         Thus, while we hold both that the district court’s reading of the consent form runs\n\nafoul of that form’s plain language6 and that this misreading of the form requires a remand,\n\nwe express no opinion on the propriety of using a contractual (or any other) analysis for\n\naddressing the disposition of the cryopreserved embryos. On remand, the district court\n\nshall not be limited to using a contractual analysis for addressing the disposition of the\n\nembryos, and shall explain why it selects whatever analysis it uses to address the\n\ndisposition of the embryos.\n\n         Whether to reopen the record on remand shall be discretionary with the district\n\ncourt.\n\n         Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n6\n We note that the Mayo Clinic, which is both the source of and a party to the consent\nagreement, is not a party to this litigation in which that agreement was construed.\n\n                                             27\n\f",

VI, § 10.\n\f                         UNPUBLISHED OPINION\n\nSMITH, TRACY M., Judge\n\n       Appellant-husband Kraig Rucker challenges an Olmsted County District Court’s\n\njudgment in the marriage-dissolution proceeding between appellant and respondent-wife\n\nKathleen Rucker. Appellant argues on appeal that the district court (1) abused its discretion\n\nby granting sole physical and sole legal custody of the parties’ children to respondent and\n\nlimiting his parenting time; (2) abused its discretion by denying appellant a downward\n\ndeviation from the presumptively appropriate guideline child-support obligation;\n\n(3) abused its discretion by denying appellant spousal maintenance; (4) abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying appellant’s nonmarital-property claim; and (5) erred in construing\n\nan in vitro fertilization consent form to award respondent the parties’ cryopreserved\n\nembryos. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion as alleged by\n\nappellant in his arguments (1)-(4). With respect to argument (5), because we conclude that\n\nthe district court erred in interpreting the consent form, we reverse and remand. We\n\ntherefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n       Appellant and respondent married in August 1998. They have two children, G.R.\n\nand M.R, ages 13 and 6 at the time of dissolution. Respondent filed a petition for\n\ndissolution of marriage in August 2014. The parties physically separated in September\n\n2014 when respondent moved out of the marital home.\n\n       When respondent left the marital home, she transferred the parties’ money,\n\nincluding money appellant had inherited from his father, from a marital joint bank account\n\n\n                                             2\n\finto her personal bank account. At trial, appellant’s financial expert testified that appellant\n\nhad $35,379 in nonmarital funds in the joint bank account on August 1, 2014. Respondent\n\ntestified that she used the withdrawn funds to pay the parties’ mortgage, property taxes,\n\nhome loan, and other marital expenses. Financial records show that from August 1, 2014,\n\nto the valuation date of June 2, 2015, money was transferred between the joint bank account\n\nand respondent’s individual account on multiple occasions. Both parties continued to\n\ndeposit paychecks in the joint bank account until respondent switched to using a personal\n\nbank account and, eventually, closed the joint bank account.\n\n       During the pendency of the proceeding, the parties shared custody of their children.\n\nRespondent requested sole physical and sole legal custody of G.R. and M.R. Appellant\n\nrequested joint physical and joint legal custody and a 50/50 parenting-time arrangement.\n\nThe district court ordered a neutral custody evaluation. In her report, the custody evaluator\n\nexpressed concerns that appellant’s negative behavior toward respondent in front of the\n\nchildren would result in the children becoming alienated from respondent. The evaluator\n\nrecommended that respondent be granted sole legal and sole physical custody.\n\n       Both appellant and respondent, as well as G.R. and M.R., began attending\n\ncounseling after the separation. Appellant was unable to participate in therapy sessions\n\nwith respondent and her therapist because he “verbally exploded and then left [the\n\ntherapist’s] office.” Concerned about respondent’s safety, her therapist advised her to “go\n\nto a Women’s Shelter for that evening and not go home.” Counselors who worked with\n\nappellant and respondent believed that appellant was unaware of his “controlling” behavior\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fand observed that he failed to cooperate in therapy sessions. Both children’s therapists\n\nfound the children “unusually” aligned with appellant.\n\n       Since the separation, appellant has been a “negative influence” on the children.\n\nAppellant used the children as “spies in [respondent’s] home.” Appellant used phone calls\n\nwith the children to sing songs about lost love to the children while they were with\n\nrespondent. Appellant told the children that divorce is a sin and people who get divorced\n\ngo to hell. According to the custody evaluator, appellant’s actions have caused the children\n\nto “internalize[] their father’s perspective and beliefs, and see their mother as the cause of\n\ntheir father’s sadness and anger. Consequently the children are rejecting of their mother\n\nand most things associated with her.”\n\n       During the pendency of the proceeding, appellant began harassing respondent by\n\nphone; text message; and Our Family Wizard, a phone application designed to help\n\nestranged parents communicate about their children. Respondent obtained a harassment\n\nrestraining order against appellant in December 2014. The district court found that\n\nappellant had stalked respondent; gone to her home uninvited; harassed her by phone, text,\n\ne-mail, and Our Family Wizard multiple times a day; and made her feel threatened.\n\n       Following six days of trial, the district court issued its findings of fact, conclusions\n\nof law, order for judgment, and judgment and decree in February 2016. With respect to\n\nchild custody, the district court analyzed the 12 best-interests factors under Minn. Stat.\n\n§ 518.17 (Supp. 2015), and at the end of each discussion noted whether the factor weighed\n\nin favor of appellant or respondent or was “neutral.” The district court granted respondent\n\nsole physical and sole legal custody of the children. The district court limited appellant’s\n\n\n                                              4\n\fparenting time to every other weekend and every Thursday evening, with additional\n\nparenting time in the summer, for vacation, and on holidays.\n\n       For purposes of child support and spousal maintenance, the district court found that\n\nrespondent has a gross monthly income of $5,315.83 and a claimed monthly budget of\n\n$5,636.67. The court found that appellant has a gross monthly income of $5,764.03 and a\n\nclaimed monthly budget of $6,483.55, but his “reasonable expenses do not exceed $3,000”\n\nafter the payment of child support and taxes. The court awarded respondent $1,335 in child\n\nsupport, including daycare and insurance expenses, and denied appellant’s request for\n\nspousal maintenance. The district court also concluded that appellant failed to establish\n\nthat respondent owed him $35,379 in nonmarital property based on her transfer of funds\n\nfrom their joint bank account to her personal bank account. Furthermore, the court\n\nconcluded that there was no credible evidence indicating that respondent had done anything\n\nimpermissible with the funds from the joint bank account because the funds had been used\n\nto pay marital expenses.\n\n       Finally, the district court awarded respondent the parties’ two cryopreserved\n\nembryos, which have been stored at Mayo Clinic since May 2008. The district court\n\nconcluded that the Mayo Clinic consent form signed by both appellant and respondent is a\n\nbinding contract that controls the disposition of the embryos and interpreted the language\n\nof the consent form to assign the property rights to the embryos to respondent in the event\n\nof divorce.\n\n       Appellant filed a posttrial motion arguing that the district court did not properly\n\nweigh the best interests of the children, should have awarded appellant spousal\n\n\n                                            5\n\fmaintenance and granted a downward deviation from the presumptively appropriate child-\n\nsupport obligation, and misconstrued the in vitro fertilization consent form. The district\n\ncourt rejected all of appellant’s arguments but stayed the disposition of the embryos.\n\n       This appeal follows.\n\n                                          DECISION\n\nI.     The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting respondent sole\n       physical and sole legal custody of the children and limiting appellant’s\n       parenting time.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting respondent\n\nsole physical and sole legal custody of their children and limiting his parenting time.

Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(a). Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd.\n\n1(a)(1)-(12), lists 12 factors to be considered in evaluating the best interests of the child.\n\nId. The statute requires the district court to make “detailed” factual findings for each factor,\n\n\n                                               6\n\fexplaining how each factor led to its conclusion, and prohibits the court from using “one\n\nfactor to the exclusion of all others.” Id., subd. 1(b)(1). The statute also requires the use\n\nof a rebuttable presumption that joint legal custody is in the best interests of a child if joint\n\nlegal custody is requested by a parent. Id., subd. 1(b)(9). The statute, however, provides\n\nfor no presumption regarding joint physical custody. See id., subd. 1(b)(7).1\n\n       A. The district court did not abuse its discretion by making shorthand\n          summaries of its findings.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to comply\n\nwith the child-centered analysis required by section 518.17 because it was inappropriate\n\nfor the district court to indicate whether each factor weighed in favor of appellant or\n\nrespondent or was neutral. Appellant contends that the district court conducted a parent-\n\ncentered analysis and that the district court’s conclusions failed to take into account the\n\npresumption that joint legal custody is in the best interests of the children.\n\n       The statute requires the district court to\n\n              make detailed findings on each of the factors in paragraph (a)\n              based on the evidence presented and explain how each factor\n              led to its conclusions and to the determination of custody and\n              parenting time. The court may not use one factor to the\n              exclusion of all others, and the court shall consider that the\n              factors may be interrelated.\n\nMinn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(b)(1). The district court’s analysis of the best-interests\n\nfactors, which used a shorthand to indicate that a factor favored “Father” or “Mother” or\n\n\n\n1\n The statute establishes a presumption against joint legal and joint physical custody in the\ncase of domestic abuse, which is not an issue in this case. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd.\n1(b)(9).\n\n                                               7\n\fwas “neutral,” is not inconsistent with the statute. See id., subd. 1(a)(1)-(12). The district\n\ncourt wrote 32 pages of factual findings on child custody, thoroughly weighed the\n\nevidence, and explained how this evidence led to its conclusions. Read in its entirety, the\n\ndistrict court’s analysis is child centered and explains why the court decided that joint legal\n\nand joint physical custody are not in the best interests of the children. The district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by making its shorthand summaries because the district court\n\ncomplied with the statute by making thorough findings of fact and explaining how these\n\nfindings led to its conclusions. See id., subd. 1(b)(1).\n\n       B. The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting respondent sole\n          physical custody and limiting appellant’s parenting time.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by granting respondent\n\nsole physical custody of the children and limiting his parenting time.\n\n       The district court found that the factors related to the children’s physical, emotional,\n\ncultural, spiritual, and other needs; the children’s special medical, mental-health, or\n\neducational needs; any physical, mental, or chemical-health issue of a parent that affects\n\nthe child’s safety or developmental needs; the willingness and ability of each parent to\n\nprovide ongoing care and meet the children’s ongoing needs; the effect of the proposed\n\ncustodial arrangement on the children’s ongoing relationships; the benefit to the children\n\nof maximizing parenting time with both parents and the detriment of limiting time with\n\neither parent; the disposition of each parent to support the child’s relationship with the\n\nother parent; and the willingness and ability of the parents to cooperate in rearing the child\n\neach weighed in favor of respondent. See id., subd. 1(a)(1)-(2), (5), (7), (9)-(12). The\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fdistrict court found that the factor related to the effect on the children’s well-being of\n\nchanges to the home, school, and community weighed in favor of appellant. See id., subd.\n\n1(a)(8). Finally, the district court found that the remaining factors were neutral and did not\n\nweigh in favor of either party. See id., subd. 1(a)(3)-(4), (6).\n\n       Regardless of appellant’s complaints about the district court’s shorthand for\n\nsummarizing its findings, the district court fully explained its best-interest findings, and\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the findings. Early in the separation, respondent obtained a\n\nharassment restraining order against appellant. The record shows that appellant was unable\n\nto participate in therapy sessions with respondent’s therapist because he “verbally exploded\n\nand then left [the therapist’s] office.” The record also shows that multiple counselors who\n\nworked with appellant and respondent believed appellant was unaware of his “controlling”\n\nbehavior and failed to cooperate in therapy sessions.\n\n       The district court found that appellant “places the children in the middle of adult\n\nissues” and attempts to undermine the children’s relationship with respondent. Both of the\n\nchildren’s therapists found them “unusually” aligned with appellant.             The record\n\ndemonstrates that appellant used G.R. to obtain information about respondent.             For\n\nexample, he sent text messages to respondent, stating, “[G.R.] will keep me posted on any\n\nplans you may be making as far as vacations so deception will not be an option any longer.”\n\nThe record also shows that appellant competed with respondent in parenting the children.\n\nFor example, appellant messaged respondent that he would ensure the Tooth Fairy\n\n“make[s] a second stop at the place she does call home” and would ensure “this visit trumps\n\nall previous ones and makes a lasting impression.” Appellant used phone calls to sing\n\n\n                                              9\n\finappropriate songs to the children while they were with respondent. Appellant told the\n\nchildren that divorce was a sin, and that people who get divorced go to hell, and he prayed\n\nwith the children for respondent to return to the marriage. The independent custody\n\nevaluator expressed concerns that appellant’s negative behavior would result in the\n\nchildren becoming alienated from respondent.\n\n       In Henrikson v. Henrikson, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that the “voluminous\n\nrecord of testimony and exhibits” supported the district court’s conclusion that “a change\n\nof custody was necessary to thwart a manifest purpose of plaintiff and her present husband\n\nto alienate the children from the affection and influence of their father.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n533, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1838572\"><a href=\"/opinion/1838572/henrikson-v-henrikson/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (1970). While this case involves an initial grant of custody, we\n\nbelieve that the circumstances of this case are sufficiently analogous to Henrikson that\n\nHenrikson can provide guidance here. Id. In particular, here, the district court found that\n\nappellant “is unable to allow the children, especially [G.R.,] to love both parents without\n\nguilt or disapproval.”\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting sole physical custody to\n\nrespondent and limiting appellant’s parenting time because substantial evidence supports\n\nits best-interests findings.2 See Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(a)(1)-(12).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Usually, custody and parenting time involve separate analyses under separate statutes.\nSee Minn. Stat. § 518.17 (describing the custody analysis); Minn. Stat. § 518.175 (Supp.\n2015) (describing the parenting-time analysis). Appellant consolidated these issues into a\nsingle argument, focusing on the child-custody issue. Appellant has argued neither that his\nparenting time is being “restricted” nor that he was not granted the presumptively\nappropriate 25% parenting time. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(b), (g).\n\n                                             10\n\f       C. The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting respondent sole\n          legal custody.\n\n       Appellant challenges the district court’s determination that respondent had\n\nproduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that joint legal custody is in the best\n\ninterests of the children. The district court stated that it used the rebuttable presumption in\n\nevaluating whether joint legal custody is in the best interests of the children but ultimately\n\ngranted sole legal custody to respondent.\n\n       Section 518.003 defines “[j]oint legal custody” to mean “both parents have equal\n\nrights and responsibilities, including the right to participate in major decisions determining\n\nthe child’s upbringing, including education, health care, and religious training.” Minn.\n\nStat. § 518.003, subd. 3(b) (2014). When one parent has requested joint legal custody,\n\nsection 518.17 instructs the district court to use a rebuttable presumption that joint legal\n\ncustody is in the best interests of the child.

App. 1984).\n\n       The district court’s grant of sole legal custody to respondent is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence that respondent and appellant lack the ability to cooperate on a level\n\nthat would permit joint legal custody. The facts of this case are analogous to those in\n\nWopata, Digatono, and Heard because appellant is unable to communicate with respondent\n\nwithout becoming upset over their relationship and additional communication is likely to\n\nresult in further tension between the parties. While not necessarily dispositive on the\n\nsubject, we note that appellant’s behavior toward respondent even led to a harassment\n\nrestraining order against appellant.\n\n       Appellant contends that both parents have agreed on and participated in the\n\nchildren’s “education, health care, and religious training” and therefore the court had no\n\nbasis for ruling that the presumption had been overcome. The statute lists the children’s\n\n“physical, emotional, cultural, spiritual, and other needs” as relevant in determining their\n\nbest interests. Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(a)(1). The district court, however, “may not\n\nuse one factor to the exclusion of all others, and the court shall consider that the factors\n\nmay be interrelated.” Id., subd. 1(b)(1). While the district court found that both parties are\n\nable to address the children’s needs in these areas, it also found that appellant “fails to have\n\nmeaningful insight into his behavior and negative impact upon [the] children.” Appellant\n\npresents no caselaw in which the parents’ current agreement on the children’s education,\n\nhealth care, and religious training was enough to require joint legal custody where the\n\n\n                                              12\n\fparents were otherwise unable to cooperate. We affirm the district court’s determination\n\nthat respondent presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of joint legal\n\ncustody and its granting of sole legal custody to respondent. Id.\n\nII.    The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant a downward\n       deviation from the presumptively appropriate guideline child-support\n       obligation.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant him\n\na downward deviation from the presumptively appropriate guideline child-support\n\nobligation. He asserts that he cannot meet his reasonable monthly expenses. The district\n\ncourt found that appellant is capable of “being self-supporting” and that his reasonable\n\nexpenses after child support and taxes “do not exceed $3,000 per month.” The district\n\ncourt concluded that, under the child-support guidelines, appellant’s presumptively\n\nappropriate guideline basic support obligation is $1,042 per month and ordered him to pay\n\nthat amount plus childcare support and medical support, for a total of $1,335 per month.\n\n       This court reviews the calculation of child support for an abuse of discretion.

In considering whether to deviate from the child-support guidelines,\n\nthe statute lists a number of factors for consideration:\n\n               (1)    all earnings, income, circumstances, and resources of\n               each parent, including real and personal property . . . ;\n               (2)    the extraordinary financial needs and resources,\n               physical and emotional condition, and educational needs of the\n               child to be supported;\n               (3)    the standard of living the child would enjoy if the\n               parents were currently living together, but recognizing that the\n               parents now have separate households . . . ;\n               (6)    the parents’ debts as provided in subdivision 2 . . . .\n\nMinn. Stat. § 518A.43, subd. 1 (Supp. 2015). In order to deviate from the statutory\n\nguidelines, the district court must make written findings articulating, among other things,\n\n“how the deviation serves the best interests of the child.” Minn. Stat. § 518A.37, subd.\n\n2(5) (2014).\n\n       We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\nappellant’s request for a downward deviation in child support. While the district court\n\nlisted appellant’s claimed monthly budget of $6,483.55 in its findings, the district court\n\nnevertheless found that appellant’s reasonable expenses do not exceed $3,000 after taxes\n\nand child support. The district court did not explain its departure from appellant’s budget,\n\nbut appellant has not shown that the district court’s calculations are so clearly erroneous as\n\nto warrant reversal.

The district court found that both parties are able to reduce their expenses and\n\n“will need to budget like most couples after a dissolution.” The district court also found\n\nthat appellant earns more than respondent and respondent will be supporting two children.\n\nWith child support, respondent could meet her new budget, which the district court\n\nimplicitly found is in the best interests of the children.\n\n       The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant a\n\ndownward deviation in child support. Putz, 645 N.W.2d at 347.\n\nIII.   The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant spousal\n       maintenance.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to award him\n\nspousal maintenance to offset his child-support obligations. We review the decision to\n\ngrant or deny spousal maintenance for an abuse of discretion. Dobrin v.

App. 2004).\n\n       A district court may award spousal maintenance upon finding that the party seeking\n\nmaintenance “lacks sufficient property . . . to provide for reasonable needs of the spouse\n\nconsidering the standard of living established during the marriage” or “is unable to provide\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fadequate self-support, after considering the standard of living established during the\n\nmarriage and all relevant circumstances, through appropriate employment.” Minn. Stat.\n\n§ 518.552, subd. 1(a)-(b) (2014). The district court concluded that there is no statutory\n\nbasis to award appellant spousal maintenance.\n\n        We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant\n\nspousal maintenance. The district court determined that both parties “earn approximately\n\n$5000 gross income per month” and “lived a moderate life style,” and that appellant has\n\n“the ability to meet his own needs independently and has sufficient education and training\n\nfor appropriate employment” to adequately support himself. Minn. Stat. § 518.552, subd.\n\n1(b).   Even appellant’s financial expert testified, “[I]n many cases when you have\n\nhouseholds that are splitting, the expenses may be more than what the available income\n\nis.” Appellant is also not the custodian of a child “whose condition or circumstances make\n\nit appropriate that the custodian not be required to seek employment outside the home.”\n\nId. No statutory ground supports appellant’s request for spousal maintenance.\n\n        Moreover, if the district court believed appellant could not meet his child-support\n\nobligations, it could deviate from the child-support guidelines—not award appellant\n\nspousal maintenance to enable him to pay child support. Minn. Stat. § 518A.43, subd. 1.\n\n        We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\nappellant spousal maintenance. Minn. Stat. § 518.552, subd. 1(a)-(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fIV.    The district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting appellant’s\n       nonmarital property claim.\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court erred by failing to reduce respondent’s share\n\nof the property equalizer by $35,379 for appellant’s nonmarital property that respondent\n\ntransferred to her personal bank account after the parties’ separation. The district court\n\nconcluded that appellant failed to prove his nonmarital claim and that no credible evidence\n\nshows that respondent used these funds for inappropriate purposes.\n\n       We evaluate the division of property for an abuse of discretion.

Under one exception to the general rule that property acquired\n\nduring a marriage and before the valuation date is marital, property acquired during a\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fmarriage and before the valuation date that is “acquired as . . . inheritance made by a third\n\nparty to one but not to the other spouse” is nonmarital property.

Id., subd. 3b(c).\n\n       To maintain its nonmarital character, nonmarital property must “either be kept\n\nseparate from marital property or, if commingled with marital property, be readily\n\ntraceable.” Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800. “[T]racing property to its nonmarital sources does\n\nnot require intricate detail.” Stark, 787 N.W.2d at 697.

Property obtained from an inheritance is nonmarital property.\n\nMinn. Stat. § 518.003, subd. 3b(a). But appellant commingled his property with marital\n\nproperty in the joint bank account. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800. In order to prove its\n\nnonmarital character, appellant must trace the property and show by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that the property is nonmarital. Stark, 787 N.W.2d at 697.\n\n       On this record, we conclude that the district court’s implicit finding that appellant\n\nfailed to trace his nonmarital property is not clearly erroneous. Kerr, 770 N.W.2d at 569.\n\nThis is not a simple case of routing funds through a joint bank account.               Nash,\n\n\n                                             18\n\f388 N.W.2d at 781. After respondent withdrew the funds, both marital and nonmarital\n\nproperty was transferred back to the joint bank account for the payment of expenses.\n\nAppellant’s expert testified that there was “a fair account of activity, but I don’t know the\n\nnature of how they segregated or designated funds to be spent.” The record supports the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that appellant used funds from her account to pay marital expenses,\n\nincluding loans and utilities for the marital home, and the funds from her account included\n\nboth appellant’s nonmarital inheritance and other, marital, funds. Thus, the funds in the\n\naccount from which the marital expenses were paid were commingled funds. And when\n\nfunds are commingled, the burden is on the party claiming a nonmarital interest to trace\n\nthat alleged nonmarital interest to specific property. Crosby v.

As a result,\n\nappellant has not shown that the district court erred in treating the property acquired during\n\nthe marriage as marital property and dividing it accordingly. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800.\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Citing Stark, appellant argues that the burden shifted to respondent to show how she\n\nspent the money once appellant traced the funds to the joint bank account on August 1,\n\n2014. 787 N.W.2d at 690. We disagree. In Stark, the appellant withdrew $63,096.45—\n\n$52,636.59 of which was the respondent’s nonmarital property—from a joint money-\n\nmarket account, without the consent of the respondent, shortly before the respondent\n\ncommenced marriage-dissolution proceedings. Id. at 697-98. This court first reviewed the\n\ndistrict court’s decision regarding whether the respondent met her burden of showing by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the withdrawn money had a nonmarital source. Id. at\n\n696-98. Having concluded that the record supported the district court’s determination that\n\nthe funds in question had a nonmarital source, the court then concluded that sufficient\n\nevidence supported the district court’s finding that the appellant had disposed of those\n\nfunds without respondent’s consent. Id. at 698. Stark, however, does not suggest that the\n\nburden of proof shifts from a party alleging wrongful disposition of property to the other\n\nparty once a nonmarital source for that property has been identified.\n\n       This case is distinguishable from Stark because appellant commingled his\n\nnonmarital property with the parties’ marital property before respondent withdrew those\n\nfunds, and respondent used those funds to pay the parties’ marital expenses after that time.\n\nIf appellant wished to preserve the nonmarital character of his inheritance, he could have\n\nkept it separate from the marital estate and traced it to the specific property existing when\n\nthe district court dissolved the marriage. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800.\n\n       Finally, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the district court’s finding\n\nthat respondent did not misuse marital property. Minn. Stat. § 518.58, subd. 1a. (2014),\n\n\n                                             20\n\fprovides that “[i]f the court finds that a party to a marriage, without consent of the other\n\nparty, has . . . transferred, encumbered, concealed, or disposed of marital assets except in\n\nthe usual course of business or for the necessities of life, the court shall compensate the\n\nother party.” By the time of valuation, respondent’s bank accounts did not contain $35,379;\n\nin other words, she did not retain the funds. The record shows that respondent handled the\n\nparties’ finances throughout the marriage. The record also shows that she used the\n\nwithdrawn marital property in the “usual course of business.” Respondent testified that\n\nappellant expected respondent to “pay all of his bills and [hers]” after she moved out of the\n\nhome. Respondent further testified that “[appellant] had been spending thousands of\n\ndollars on eBay and other places,” and respondent was concerned that appellant would\n\ninappropriately use an excessive amount of the money. Respondent used money that had\n\nderived from the parties’ joint bank account to pay the parties’ mortgage, property taxes,\n\nhome-equity loan, and other expenses. The personal account from which respondent paid\n\nexpenses also included her paychecks. The district court found no credible evidence that\n\nrespondent had inappropriately used the funds. We defer to this credibility determination.\n\nSefkow, 427 N.W.2d at 210. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nfinding that respondent had not misused the marital funds. Olsen, 562 N.W.2d at 800.\n\n       Because appellant failed to properly trace his nonmarital claim and evidence\n\nsupports the finding that respondent did not misuse marital property, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant’s nonmarital claim and did\n\nnot otherwise abuse its discretion when it divided these assets.

The district court erred in awarding respondent the cryopreserved embryos.\n\n       Appellant challenges the district court’s award to respondent of the cryopreserved\n\nembryos.

It includes a\n\ncheck-the-box section addressing what the Mayo Clinic is to do with the cryopreserved\n\nembryos in certain circumstances, including “[d]ivorce/separation.” For that circumstance,\n\nthe column labeled “[c]ontinue to [s]tore for transfer to female partner” is checked. In the\n\ndissolution judgment, the district court noted that respondent wants the embryos “awarded\n\nto her pursuant to the consent [form] so that she may elect to have the embryos destroyed\n\nin light of the dissolution of the parties’ marriage,”3 while appellant “wants the embryos\n\nawarded to him, [to] continue to be stored indefinitely, and he is willing to pay for\n\nstorage.”4 The district court ruled that the consent form “is a binding contract, enforceable\n\nby the court,” and, apparently based on the form’s reference to “transfer to female partner,”\n\nruled that “[t]he 2 remaining embryos shall be awarded to [respondent].” Appellant argues\n\nthat the “plain language” of the consent form requires that the embryos be stored.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  We express no opinion regarding whether respondent’s wish to “destroy[]” the embryos\nis consistent with the consent form’s statement that the embryos are to be “store[d]” for\n“transfer to the female partner.”\n4\n  We express no opinion regarding whether appellant’s wish to store the embryos\n“indefinitely” is consistent with the consent form’s statement that “[t]he maximum period”\nfor storage “is 10 years.”\n\n                                             22\n\f         When the terms of a contract are unambiguous, courts enforce the contract as\n\nwritten, absent an infirmity that would invalidate it.

Wells Fargo & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2219072\"><a href=\"/opinion/2219072/denelsbeck-v-wells-fargo-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (Minn. 2003). “A\n\ncontract is ambiguous if, based upon its language alone, it is reasonably susceptible of more\n\nthan one interpretation.” Id. (quotation omitted). Here, we conclude that the consent\n\nform’s use of “transfer” in its check-the-box section unambiguously refers to placing the\n\nembryos in the female partner in an attempt to produce a pregnancy. Thus, because the\n\ndistrict court apparently based its award of the embryos to respondent on a reading of\n\n“transfer” to mean an assignment or conveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing\n\ntheir custodian or keeper, we conclude that the district court’s disposition of the embryos\n\nis based on an incorrect reading of the consent form, and we remand the question of the\n\ndisposition of the embryos to the district court.\n\n         A. Construction of the consent form\n\n         As noted, in the check-the-box section of the consent form, the column labeled\n\n“[c]ontinue to [s]tore for transfer to female partner” is checked for the circumstance of\n\n“[d]ivorce/separation.” The form also states:\n\n                In the majority of cases, more oocytes[5] are retrieved and\n                fertilized than may be necessary to achieve a pregnancy. When\n                this situation occurs, two options exist under the [Mayo Clinic\n                Assisted Reproductive Technology] program for the handling\n                of these extra fertilized oocytes.\n\n5\n    The consent form states that an “oocyte” is “a mature egg.”\n\n                                              23\n\f                      1.      Transfer the ideal number (presently thought to\n               be 2 to 3) of the fertilized oocytes and discard the remainder;\n\n                      2.      Transfer the ideal number of fertilized oocytes\n               and store the remaining fertilized oocytes by the process called\n               “cryopreservation.” Transfer of cryopreserved embryos after\n               an unsuccessful embryo transfer of fresh embryos improves the\n               overall chance for a successful pregnancy.\n\n               If at some time in the future a transfer is considered, the\n               fertilized oocytes will be thawed and examined. If it appears\n               that they are viable, the transfer will be undertaken.\n\nThe use of “transfer” in the portion of the form quoted above, particularly in item 2 and the\n\ntwo sentences following it, unambiguously (a) does not refer to an assignment or\n\nconveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing their custodian or keeper; and (b)\n\ndoes refer to using the embryos in an attempt to produce a pregnancy. See Stedman’s\n\nMedical Dictionary 1622 (25th ed. 1990) (noting that “transfer” in the context of artificial\n\ninsemination procedures refers to when, “after either in vitro or in vivo artificial\n\ninsemination, the fertilized ovum is transferred . . . to the recipient’s uterus.”).\n\n       Consistent with this produce-a-pregnancy sense of “transfer,” as well as the idea\n\nthat the “ideal” number of fertilized oocytes to be transferred in an attempt to produce a\n\npregnancy is two to three, a second part of the form identifies the “[n]umber [of fertilized\n\noocytes] for fresh transfer” as “2-3.” A third portion of the form states that the “[t]ype of\n\nfresh transfer” that is to occur for the parties is a transfer at the “[c]leavage stage” of oocyte\n\ndevelopment. And a fourth portion of the form notes that the Mayo Clinic “recommend[s]”\n\na process identified as “Assisted Hatching” for “multiple prior failed embryo transfers.”\n\nEach of these uses of “transfer” unambiguously refers to attempts to produce a pregnancy.\n\n\n                                               24\n\fA fifth section of the form, however, states, “You have the option of transferring your\n\nembryos from Mayo Clinic. It is your responsibility to make the arrangements for any\n\ntransfer.” This fifth section of the form uses “transfer” in a sense other than the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense. Thus, while the form generally seems to use “transfer” in the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense, that sense of “transfer” does not appear to be the only sense in which\n\nthat word is used in the form.\n\n       The crux of the parties’ dispute regarding construction of the form is whether\n\n“transfer,” as used in the check-the-box section of the form, refers to (a) an assignment or\n\nconveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing their custodian or keeper; or (b) using\n\nthe embryos in an attempt to produce a pregnancy. Here, for three reasons, we conclude\n\nthat the check-the-box section of the form unambiguously uses “transfer” in the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense. First, generally, unless context suggests otherwise, courts construing a\n\ncontract assume that a word in a contract has the same meaning throughout the contract.\n\nSee, e.g., Smitke v. Travelers Indem. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236392\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236392/smitke-v-travelers-indemnity-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (1962)\n\n(construing “relative” to carry the same meaning throughout the entirety of the contract).\n\nAnd, as noted above, the majority of the uses of “transfer” in the form are in the produce-\n\na-pregnancy sense of that term. Second, while the check-the-box section of the form allows\n\nstorage for transfer to the female partner, it lacks any indication that cryopreserved\n\nembryos can (ever) be “transferred” to the male partner. The lack of an option to transfer\n\nthe embryos to the male partner makes little sense if “transfer” merely refers to an\n\nassignment or conveyance of the embryos for purposes of changing their custodian or\n\nkeeper. Third, the check-the-box section of the form does not allow selection of the store-\n\n\n                                            25\n\ffor-transfer-to-the-female-partner option at the end of what the form identifies as the 10-\n\nyear maximum storage period for cryopreserved embryos, a prohibition making sense only\n\nif “transfer” is being used to refer to trying to produce a pregnancy. Thus, on this record,\n\nwe conclude that the district court’s reading of the form was incorrect, and that its\n\ndisposition of the cryopreserved embryos based on that reading must be remanded.\n\n       B. Other matters\n\n       Appellant makes several “alternative[]” arguments to challenge the district court’s\n\ndisposition of the embryos, including arguments questioning whether the disposition of\n\nembryos should be decided based on a contractual analysis. We need not address these\n\narguments because, based on the plain language of the consent form, we are reversing the\n\ndistrict court’s reading of that form and remanding for the district court to readdress the\n\ndisposition of the embryos. We note, however, that appellant’s alternative arguments are\n\nconsistent with questions raised by respondent in the district court, and that, while the\n\ndistrict court used a contractual analysis for addressing the disposition of the embryos, it\n\ndid not explain why it did so. As a result, it is unclear whether the district court’s use of\n\nthe contractual analysis is a considered choice, or simply an assumption that the contractual\n\nanalysis is a proper vehicle for addressing disposition of the embryos.\n\n       A district court’s failure to address why a particular result was reached (here, why\n\na contractual analysis was used to address disposition of the embryos) can limit the\n\nreviewability of the district court’s decision on the point.

Rupe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">330</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 338 (Minn.

Here, that limitation is exacerbated by the fact that\n\nthe disposition of the parties’ cryopreserved embryos is a question of first impression in\n\nMinnesota.\n\n         Thus, while we hold both that the district court’s reading of the consent form runs\n\nafoul of that form’s plain language6 and that this misreading of the form requires a remand,\n\nwe express no opinion on the propriety of using a contractual (or any other) analysis for\n\naddressing the disposition of the cryopreserved embryos. On remand, the district court\n\nshall not be limited to using a contractual analysis for addressing the disposition of the\n\nembryos, and shall explain why it selects whatever analysis it uses to address the\n\ndisposition of the embryos.\n\n         Whether to reopen the record on remand shall be discretionary with the district\n\ncourt.\n\n         Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n6\n We note that the Mayo Clinic, which is both the source of and a party to the consent\nagreement, is not a party to this litigation in which that agreement was construed.\n\n                                             27\n\f</pre>",
