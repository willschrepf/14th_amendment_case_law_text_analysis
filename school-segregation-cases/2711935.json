Ramsey appeal the award\n\nof damages to appellees James R. and Marianne Spray on the Sprays’\n\nDeceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA) claim arising from\n\nthe sale and purchase of a house. We affirm in part, reverse and render in part,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          … See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\fand reverse and remand in part for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n      In 2002, appellants Joel A. and Marla K. Ramsey decided to sell their\n\nhouse in Flower Mound, Texas, and hired Sharon Hodnett of Keller\n\nWilliams/DFW as their agent.\n\n      More than ten months before entering into a contract for sale of their\n\nhouse to James R. and Marianne Spray, the Ramseys completed a sellers’\n\ndisclosure notice. Approximately five months before the sale closed on May\n\n23, 2003, the Ramseys discovered water damage in the kitchen caused by a\n\nleaky roof. The Ramseys, however, did not supplement or amend their sellers’\n\ndisclosure notice to reflect the house’s faulty roof or the water damage. The\n\nSprays’ home inspector, James Wood, identified various minor needed repairs\n\nbut did not identify any water damage or a faulty roof.\n\n      After purchasing the house, the Sprays began to experience problems\n\nassociated with water penetration due to the house’s faulty roof. Mrs. Spray\n\ndiscovered standing water in one of the kitchen drawers in approximately July\n\n2003. In December 2003, the Sprays hired a contractor to investigate and fix\n\nthe problem.     The contractor found multiple leaks due to improper roof\n\ninstallation.   The leaks resulted in water damage throughout the house,\n\n                                      2\n\fincluding damaged roof decking, exterior wall studs, interior walls, and wooden\n\nflooring. The total cost to repair the damage to the house was $190,445.70.\n\n      The Sprays sued the Ramseys, Hodnett, Keller Williams/DFW, and Wood\n\nfor negligence, fraud, breach of warranty, violations of the DTPA, and\n\nunconscionable or knowing conduct. The Sprays sought judgment against all\n\ndefendants “jointly and severally” for actual, exemplary, punitive, statutory,\n\ntreble, and mental anguish damages, attorney’s fees, interest, and costs.\n\n      On November 3, 2006, the Sprays settled and released all claims with\n\nHodnett, Keller Williams/DFW, and Wood for a collective amount of $400,000.\n\n      The case proceeded to trial against the Ramseys on May 21, 2007.\n\nDuring trial, the Ramseys introduced the settlement agreement for the purpose\n\nof obtaining a settlement credit, and it was admitted without objection.\n\n      The jury returned a verdict finding the Ramseys liable for fraud and DTPA\n\nviolations. The jury awarded the Sprays $200,000 actual damages for the\n\ncosts of repair to the house, mental anguish damages of $100,000 each,\n\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\f$2,000,000 in “additional” damages,2 and $50,000 in attorney’s fees through\n\ntrial.\n\n         On December 21, 2007, the trial court rendered final judgment on the\n\nDTPA verdict, awarding the Sprays $190,445.70 in actual damages,\n\n$571,337.10 in “additional” damages,3 $100,000 each to the Sprays for\n\nmental anguish, plus attorney’s fees, interest, and costs. After judgment was\n\nrendered, the Ramseys filed a motion for new trial, asserting, among other\n\ncomplaints, that the trial court erred by not applying the $400,000 settlement\n\namount as a credit against the damages award and by awarding “excessive”\n\nactual damages. The motion for new trial was overruled by operation of law.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n      … “Additional” damages are amounts recoverable under section\n17.50(b)(1) in excess of economic damages; they may include mental anguish\ndamages and treble economic damages based on the finding of a knowing\nDTPA violation. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(b)(1), (e), (f)\n(Vernon Supp. 2009).\n         3\n       … The trial court reduced the jury’s “additional” damages award of\n$2,000,000 pursuant to the DTPA, which mandates that economic and\n“additional” damages be capped at treble economic damages. See id.\n§ 17.50(b)(1) (“If the trier of fact finds that the conduct of the defendant was\ncommitted knowingly . . . the trier of fact may award not more than three times\nthe amount of economic damages.”).\n\n                                       4\n\f                                   II.   ISSUES\n\n      The Ramseys bring the following five issues on appeal:\n\n      1)    The trial court abused its discretion by failing to apply as a\n\nsettlement credit against the damages award the $400,000 that the Sprays\n\nreceived in settlement from Hodnett, Keller Williams/DFW, and Wood.\n\n      2)    The trial court erred by awarding as additional damages under the\n\nDTPA four times the amount of actual damages.\n\n      3)    The trial court erred in calculating pre- and post-judgment interest,\n\nresulting in an excessive and usurious interest award.\n\n      4)    The Sprays’ awards of mental anguish damages are not supported\n\nby legally sufficient evidence.\n\n      5)    The actual damages award is not supported by legally or factually\n\nsufficient evidence because it includes $15,000 in repair costs that are\n\nunrelated to the Sprays’ DTPA claims.\n\n                         III.     SETTLEMENT CREDIT\n\n      In their first issue, the Ramseys complain that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by failing to credit against the damages award the $400,000 the\n\nSprays received in settlement.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fA.    Standard of Review\n\n      A trial court’s determination of the existence or amount of a settlement\n\ncredit is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.4 To determine whether a trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion, we must decide whether the trial court acted\n\nwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles; in other words, we must\n\ndecide whether the act was arbitrary or unreasonable.5     An appellate court\n\ncannot conclude that a trial court abused its discretion merely because the\n\nappellate court would have ruled differently in the same circumstances.6\n\n      An abuse of discretion does not occur when the trial court bases its\n\ndecisions on conflicting evidence. 7 Furthermore, an abuse of discretion does\n\nnot occur as long as some evidence of substantive and probative character\n\nexists to support the trial court’s decision.8\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      … Oyster Creek Fin.

Law Governing Settlement Credits\n\n      Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 33 governs settlement\n\ncredits in all tort and DTPA actions. 9 Section 33.012(b) of the code provides:\n\n      If the claimant has settled with one or more persons, the court shall\n      further reduce the amount of damages to be recovered by the\n      claimant with respect to a cause of action by the sum of the dollar\n      amounts of all settlements.10\n\nThis statute is mandatory.11 Because section 33.012(b) calls for settlement\n\ncredits to apply to “damages to be recovered by the claimant,” the credit is\n\napplied to the amount of damages awarded in the judgment, not the amount of\n\ndamages found by the jury.12\n\n\n\n\n      9\n       … Tex.

Arthur Andersen,\nL.L.P., 106 S.W.3d 304, 310 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.).\n\n                                        8\n\f      In addition, the nonsettling defendant may only claim a credit based on\n\nthe damages for which all tortfeasors are jointly liable.18 However, if settlement\n\nmonies were also paid on claims for which there is no joint and several liability,\n\nit is the plaintiff’s burden to establish any reduction in a settlement credit by\n\ntendering a settlement agreement that allocates the settlement amount between\n\nsole and joint liability claims.19 Otherwise, the nonsettling defendant is entitled\n\nto the full credit.20\n\nC.    Application of the Settlement Credit\n\n      The Ramseys assert that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to\n\nreduce the judgment award by the entire $400,000 amount that the Sprays\n\nreceived in settlement. In response, the Sprays contend that the court did\n\napply the $400,000 settlement credit by reducing the jury’s $2,000,000\n\n“additional” damages award to $571,337.10.           The trial court’s judgment,\n\nhowever, states that the additional damages award was made “pursuant to the\n\n\n\n\n      18\n        … Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 390–92 (Tex. 2000)\n(op. on reh’g); CTTI Priesmeyer, Inc. v. K & O Ltd. P’ship, 164 S.W.3d 675,\n684–85 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, no pet.); Roberts, 868 S.W.2d at 959.\n      19\n           … CTTI, 164 S.W.3d at 685 n.3; Cohen, 106 S.W.3d at 310.\n      20\n           … CTTI, 164 S.W.3d at 685 n.3; Cohen, 106 S.W.3d at 310.\n\n                                        9\n\fterms of the [DTPA].” 21 There is no evidence in the record that the damages\n\nwere reduced, as the Sprays contend, as a result of the trial court’s application\n\nof settlement credit.\n\n      In the alternative, the Sprays contend that the Ramseys are not entitled\n\nto have the $400,000 settlement credit applied against the additional damages\n\nbecause they are punitive in nature and the Ramseys and settling defendants\n\nare not jointly and severally liable for punitive damages.      It is well settled,\n\nhowever, that “any credit for settlements made by other alleged joint\n\ntortfeasors must be applied[, if at all,] after the trebling of actual damages.” 22\n\nMoreover, the Sprays did not meet their burden of showing that the settlement\n\nagreement allocated dollars toward the settlement of punitive damages or\n\nclaims for which the settling defendants and the Ramseys were not jointly and\n\n\n\n      21\n        … Section 17.50(b)(1) of the DTPA provides that “the trier of fact may\naward not more than three times the amount of economic damages” based on\nthe defendant’s knowing conduct. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann.\n§ 17.50(b)(1). Although the trial court erroneously exceeded this cap by\nawarding the Sprays four times the amount of economic damages, see infra\nPart IV, it is clear from the face of the judgment that the additional damages\naward was made pursuant to the DTPA and not pursuant to section 33.012(b)\nof the civil practice and remedies code.\n      22\n        … Stewart Title, 822 S.W.2d at 9; see Universal Servs. Co. v. Ung, 882\nS.W.2d 460, 467 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994) (“[I]n cases where\nactual damages awards may be trebled by statute, the supreme court allows\ncredits of settlement proceeds against the trebled sum.” (emphasis in original)),\nrev’d on other grounds, 904 S.W.2d 638 (Tex. 1995).\n\n                                        10\n\fseverally liable.23 Because this burden was not met, the Sprays are not entitled\n\nto a reduction of settlement credit.24\n\n      We hold that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to apply the\n\n$400,000 settlement credit against the economic damages awards. We sustain\n\nthe Ramseys’ first issue.\n\n                            IV.   TREBLE DAMAGES\n\n      In their second issue, the Ramseys contend that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by awarding the Sprays four times, rather than three times, the\n\namount of their economic damages under the DTPA. 25 Section 17.50(b)(1) of\n\nthe Texas Business and Commerce Code permits a maximum award of three\n\ntimes the amount of economic damages for a knowing DTPA violation,\n\nproviding:\n\n\n\n      23\n           … See Ellender, 968 S.W.2d at 928; Cohen, 106 S.W.3d at 310.\n      24\n       … See Oyster Creek, 176 S.W.3d at 327; CTTI, 164 S.W.3d at 685\nn.3; Cohen, 106 S.W.3d at 310.\n      25\n        … The Sprays argue that the Ramseys failed to preserve error because\nthey did not object to the additional damages award in the trial court. In the\nRamseys’ motion for suggestion of remittitur, however, they complain that\n“[t]he amount awarded [in the jury verdict] as additional damages is clearly\nexcessive and unlawful because the DTPA specifically provides that additional\ndamages may not exceed ‘more than three times the amount of economic\ndamages’ when the alleged deceptive practice was committed ‘knowingly’”\n(quoting Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(b)(1)). The Ramseys, therefore,\npreserved this issue for our review.\n\n                                         11\n\f     (b) In a suit filed under this section, each consumer who prevails\n     may obtain:\n\n              (1) the amount of economic damages found by the trier of\n              fact. If the trier of fact finds that the conduct of the\n              defendant was committed knowingly, the consumer may also\n              recover damages for mental anguish, as found by the trier of\n              fact, and the trier of fact may award not more than three\n              times the amount of economic damages. 26\n\n     When a trial court awards actual damages on a DTPA claim and, in\n\naddition, awards three times that amount based on the jury’s award of\n\n“additional” damages for a knowing DTPA violation, the result is an award of\n\nfour times the damages amount.27 In such cases, the appellate court should\n\nmodify the judgment “to limit the DTPA award to three times the amount of\n\neconomic damages.” 28\n\n     In this case, the trial court entered judgment awarding the Sprays\n\n$190,445.70 in actual economic damages plus three times that amount, or\n\n$571,337.10. As a result, the trial court awarded the Sprays four times the\n\namount of their economic damages. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\n\n\n     26\n          … Tex. Bus. & Com.

AWARD OF PRE- AND POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST\n\n      In their third issue, the Ramseys complain of the award of pre- and post-\n\njudgment interest on four distinct grounds, three of which are waived because\n\nthey were not preserved in the trial court.30        The only ground that was\n\n\n      29\n         … A trial court abuses its discretion if it misapplies the law to\nestablished facts. State v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 526 S.W.2d 526, 528 (Tex.\n1975); In re Talco-Bogata Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. Bond Election, 994 S.W.2d\n343, 347 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, no pet.); see also Marsh v. Marsh, 949\nS.W.2d 734, 744 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, no writ) (“A clear\nfailure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an\nabuse of discretion.”).\n      30\n        … In their motion for suggestion of remittitur, the Ramseys assert that\nthe DTPA prohibits consideration of prejudgment interest when calculating\n“additional” damages. They did not present the trial court with the three other\ngrounds on which they now challenge the trial court’s interest award: 1) that\nthe DTPA prohibits prejudgment interest on mental anguish damages; 2) that\nthe DTPA prohibits prejudgment interest on future damages; and 3) that the\nfinance code requires application of pre- and post-judgment interest at a rate of\n7.5 percent. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) (providing that a party must have\npresented to the trial court a timely request, objection, or motion that states the\nspecific grounds for the desired ruling, if they are not apparent from the context\nof the request, objection, or motion, and obtain an express or implied ruling\nfrom the trial court); Campbell v. State, 85 S.W.3d 176, 185 (Tex. 2002).\nContrary to the Ramseys’ contention, error in the calculation of pre- and post-\njudgment interest is not recognized as fundamental error reviewable on appeal\neven when not preserved in the trial court. See In re B.L.D., 113 S.W.3d 340,\n350 (Tex. 2003) (stating civil doctrine of fundamental error is “discredited” and\nis only recognized “in rare instances” when the record shows a jurisdictional\n\n                                        13\n\fpreserved was whether the trial court erred by awarding three times the amount\n\nof prejudgment interest on the Sprays’ actual damages.\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n       We apply an abuse of discretion standard to review the trial court’s award\n\nof prejudgment interest. 31    Under this standard, we will not disturb a trial\n\ncourt’s findings on factual issues unless the court reasonably could have\n\nreached only one decision and it failed to do so. 32 However, “[a] trial court has\n\nno ‘discretion’ in determining what the law is or applying the law to the\n\nfacts.” 33    Accordingly, the abuse of discretion standard applies to the trial\n\ncourt’s factual findings as they relate to prejudgment interest; but the de novo\n\nstandard applies to the trial court’s application of the law to the facts.34\n\n\n\ndefect or when certain types of error are committed in juvenile delinquency\ncases), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 945 (2004); see also Pirtle v. Gregory, 629\nS.W.2d 919, 919–20 (Tex. 1982). Therefore, the Ramseys waived these three\ngrounds as bases for challenging the trial court’s interest award. See Tex.

Prejudgment Interest and Treble Damages Under the DTPA\n\n     Section 17.50(b)(1) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code permits\n\nonly economic damages to be trebled on DTPA claims. 35        Section 17.50(e)\n\nstates that “prejudgment interest may not be considered” in computing such\n\ndamages.36 When a trial court calculates “additional” damages under section\n\n17.50(b), the amount of the “additional damages” “is to be based upon the\n\nactual damages only, not actual damages plus prejudgment interest.” 37\n\n     Here, the trial court ordered that the Sprays recover “trebled pre-judgment\n\ninterest of 7.75%” on the actual damages award of $190,445.70 in repair\n\ncosts. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion as a matter of law in\n\nawarding treble prejudgment interest. Accordingly, we sustain the preserved\n\nportion of the Ramseys’ third issue on appeal.\n\n                      VI.     MENTAL ANGUISH DAMAGES\n\n     In their fourth issue, the Ramseys argue that the evidence is not legally\n\nsufficient to support the $100,000 awards of mental anguish damages to Mrs.\n\nSpray and Mr. Spray.\n\n\n     35\n          … Tex.

Mental Anguish Damages Under the DTPA\n\n      Section 17.50(b)(1) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code allows\n\nthe award of mental anguish damages on a DTPA claim if the trier of fact finds\n\nthat the conduct of the defendant was committed “knowingly.” 40 To recover\n\nmental anguish damages under the DTPA, the plaintiff must present “direct\n\nevidence of the nature, duration, and severity of the[] mental anguish, thus\n\nestablishing a substantial disruption in the [plaintiff’s] daily routine.” 41 Proof of\n\na physical manifestation of mental anguish is not required.42 The plaintiff’s\n\ndirect evidence may include the plaintiff’s own testimony or that of a third party\n\nor expert witness.43 If there is no direct evidence of mental anguish, we apply\n\ntraditional no-evidence standards to determine whether the record reveals any\n\n\n\n\n      40\n        … Tex.

Marianne Spray\n\n      To support her mental anguish claim, Marianne Spray testified at trial\n\nregarding her mental state and the impact the damage to the house has had on\n\nher life. She testified that she feels “more comfortable in a hotel” than in her\n\nhouse and that this has been the cause of “uncomfortable” discussions\n\n\n\n\n      44\n      … Latham, 972 S.W.2d at 70; see Parkway, 901 S.W.2d at 444;\nAnderson, 118 S.W.3d at 811.\n      45\n       … Gunn Infiniti, Inc. v.

Mrs. Spray testified that she has\n\nexperienced “anxious feelings,” “anxiousness, anxieties, frustration, humiliation,\n\n[and] embarrassment,” that she wakes up at night, and that she has not slept\n\n“well” since moving into the house. In addition, although in the past the Sprays\n\nentertained “quite a bit” for Mr. Spray’s work, Mrs. Spray stated that she is\n\nnow “reluctant” to bring people to their house.\n\n      Mrs. Spray also testified at trial that she feels “cheated” and like her soul\n\nhas been “raped.” The situation regarding her house makes her “very angry”\n\nand causes her to “question all the things that [she] believe[s] in and [her]\n\nfaith.” Mrs. Spray stated that there “really hasn't been much quality of life in\n\nthis house” and that it has been “a nightmare” “[t]o an extreme degree.”\n\n      Mrs. Spray cried at trial, stating that her crying was due to the “buildup\n\nof . . . frustration”; she testified that she also has cried in private over the\n\nsituation regarding her house. And Mr. Spray testified at trial that he has seen\n\nMrs. Spray cry “over this problem” on two or three occasions. In addition, Mrs.\n\nSpray testified that she does not feel safe because “there’s carbon monoxide\n\nin the house” and that she suffers from hypertension as a result of the\n\n“emotional issues” she experienced regarding the house.\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to Mrs. Spray, her conclusory\n\ntestimony does not present more than a scintilla of evidence that her alleged\n\n                                       19\n\fmental anguish caused a substantial disruption in her daily routine or amounted\n\nto a “high degree of mental pain and distress” that is more than mere worry,\n\nanxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger.48 Accordingly, we sustain this\n\nportion of the Ramseys’ fourth issue on appeal.\n\nD.    James Spray\n\n      To support his mental anguish claim, James Spray testified at trial that\n\nhe is “pretty embarrassed” and “pretty angry” and has felt “anxiety” over his\n\nhouse. He feels that the Ramseys have breached his trust, and he “kick[s]\n\n[him]self” because he feels that he has been “cheated.” Mr. Spray cried at\n\ntrial, which he testified was attributable to his “continuous” and “extreme”\n\nfeelings of anger toward the Ramseys. Mr. Spray also testified that he felt\n\n“violated” and like a “failure.”\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to Mr. Spray, his testimony does not\n\npresent more than a scintilla of evidence that his alleged mental anguish caused\n\na substantial disruption in his daily routine or amounted to a “high degree of\n\nmental pain and distress” that is more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation,\n\n\n\n\n      48\n         … Latham, 972 S.W.2d at 69–70; see Parkway, 901 S.W.2d at 444;\nAnderson, 118 S.W.3d at 811; see also Cont'l Coffee Prods.

We\n\nsustain the remaining portion of the Ramseys’ fourth issue.50\n\n\n           VII.   ACTUAL DAMAGES RELATED TO FENCE REPAIR\n\n\n      In their fifth issue, the Ramseys argue that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support $15,000 of the $190,445.70 actual damages\n\naward because $15,000 is attributable to the repair of a hail-damaged fence\n\nand this damage does not relate to the Sprays’ DTPA claim. The Sprays argue\n\nthat the Ramseys did not preserve error on this issue in part because the actual-\n\ndamages question submitted to the jury did not segregate, nor did the Ramseys\n\nask the trial court for it to segregate, the cost to repair the fence from other\n\nactual damages awarded. According to the Sprays, it is therefore impossible\n\nto determine what amount the jury did or did not award for the repair of the\n\nfence.\n\n\n\n\n      49\n       … Latham, 972 S.W.2d at 69–70; see Cont’l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at\n450; Parkway, 901 S.W.2d at 444; Anderson, 118 S.W.3d at 811.\n      50\n         … Because we sustain this issue on other grounds, we do not address,\nand express no opinion regarding, the Ramseys’ contention that the Sprays\nfailed to establish a causal link between the Sprays’ alleged mental anguish and\nthe Ramseys’ DTPA violations.\n\n                                       21\n\f      When a damages question is submitted to the jury that includes multiple\n\npossible elements, to preserve error challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting one but not all of the elements of damages a defendant is required\n\nto object and ask the trial court to either exclude that element from the\n\ndamages question or submit damages elements separately.51\n\n      In this case, the Sprays presented evidence of fence and other repair\n\ncosts to the jury. The Ramseys failed to object to the submission of the actual\n\ndamages question on the ground that it may include fence repair costs.52 They\n\nalso failed to request the submission of an alternate question that either\n\nexcluded or segregated fence repair costs from other actual damages. 5 3\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the Ramseys failed to preserve error regarding the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the portion of the actual damages they\n\n\n\n\n      51\n       … Tagle v. Galvan, 155 S.W.3d 510, 515–16 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n2004, no pet.)

CONCLUSION\n\n      In conclusion, we hold that the trial court erred by failing to apply\n\n$400,000 in settlement credit against the award of economic damages; by\n\nawarding the Sprays more than three times the amount of their economic\n\ndamages; and by awarding three times the amount of prejudgment interest on\n\nthe Sprays’ actual damages.      We further hold that the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to support the mental anguish damages awards in favor of the\n\nSprays.\n\n      We, therefore, reverse that part of the trial court’s judgment awarding the\n\nSprays their economic damages, and remand that part of the judgment to the\n\ntrial court for recalculation of those damage awards and application of the\n\nsettlement credit, pursuant to this opinion. In addition, we reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s award of “trebled pre-judgment interest of 7.75% from January 24,\n\n2005[,]” assessed on the Sprays’ actual and mental anguish damages, and\n\nrender judgment that they recover interest of 7.75% from January 24, 2005,\n\n\n      54\n           … See Thomas, 895 S.W.2d at 360; Tagle, 155 S.W.3d at 519.\n      55\n        … Because the Ramseys failed to preserve error, we also do not address\ntheir unpreserved claim that the $15,000 cost to repair the fence was not\nreasonable and necessary.\n\n                                       23\n\fonly on the amount of the damages, if any, that they are entitled to recover\n\nupon application of settlement credit.

App. P. 47.4.\n\fand reverse and remand in part for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n      In 2002, appellants Joel A. and Marla K. Ramsey decided to sell their\n\nhouse in Flower Mound, Texas, and hired Sharon Hodnett of Keller\n\nWilliams/DFW as their agent.\n\n      More than ten months before entering into a contract for sale of their\n\nhouse to James R. and Marianne Spray, the Ramseys completed a sellers’\n\ndisclosure notice. Approximately five months before the sale closed on May\n\n23, 2003, the Ramseys discovered water damage in the kitchen caused by a\n\nleaky roof. The Ramseys, however, did not supplement or amend their sellers’\n\ndisclosure notice to reflect the house’s faulty roof or the water damage. The\n\nSprays’ home inspector, James Wood, identified various minor needed repairs\n\nbut did not identify any water damage or a faulty roof.\n\n      After purchasing the house, the Sprays began to experience problems\n\nassociated with water penetration due to the house’s faulty roof. Mrs. Spray\n\ndiscovered standing water in one of the kitchen drawers in approximately July\n\n2003. In December 2003, the Sprays hired a contractor to investigate and fix\n\nthe problem.     The contractor found multiple leaks due to improper roof\n\ninstallation.   The leaks resulted in water damage throughout the house,\n\n                                      2\n\fincluding damaged roof decking, exterior wall studs, interior walls, and wooden\n\nflooring. The total cost to repair the damage to the house was $190,445.70.\n\n      The Sprays sued the Ramseys, Hodnett, Keller Williams/DFW, and Wood\n\nfor negligence, fraud, breach of warranty, violations of the DTPA, and\n\nunconscionable or knowing conduct. The Sprays sought judgment against all\n\ndefendants “jointly and severally” for actual, exemplary, punitive, statutory,\n\ntreble, and mental anguish damages, attorney’s fees, interest, and costs.\n\n      On November 3, 2006, the Sprays settled and released all claims with\n\nHodnett, Keller Williams/DFW, and Wood for a collective amount of $400,000.\n\n      The case proceeded to trial against the Ramseys on May 21, 2007.\n\nDuring trial, the Ramseys introduced the settlement agreement for the purpose\n\nof obtaining a settlement credit, and it was admitted without objection.\n\n      The jury returned a verdict finding the Ramseys liable for fraud and DTPA\n\nviolations. The jury awarded the Sprays $200,000 actual damages for the\n\ncosts of repair to the house, mental anguish damages of $100,000 each,\n\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\f$2,000,000 in “additional” damages,2 and $50,000 in attorney’s fees through\n\ntrial.\n\n         On December 21, 2007, the trial court rendered final judgment on the\n\nDTPA verdict, awarding the Sprays $190,445.70 in actual damages,\n\n$571,337.10 in “additional” damages,3 $100,000 each to the Sprays for\n\nmental anguish, plus attorney’s fees, interest, and costs. After judgment was\n\nrendered, the Ramseys filed a motion for new trial, asserting, among other\n\ncomplaints, that the trial court erred by not applying the $400,000 settlement\n\namount as a credit against the damages award and by awarding “excessive”\n\nactual damages. The motion for new trial was overruled by operation of law.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n      … “Additional” damages are amounts recoverable under section\n17.50(b)(1) in excess of economic damages; they may include mental anguish\ndamages and treble economic damages based on the finding of a knowing\nDTPA violation. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(b)(1), (e), (f)\n(Vernon Supp. 2009).\n         3\n       … The trial court reduced the jury’s “additional” damages award of\n$2,000,000 pursuant to the DTPA, which mandates that economic and\n“additional” damages be capped at treble economic damages. See id.\n§ 17.50(b)(1) (“If the trier of fact finds that the conduct of the defendant was\ncommitted knowingly . . . the trier of fact may award not more than three times\nthe amount of economic damages.”).\n\n                                       4\n\f                                   II.   ISSUES\n\n      The Ramseys bring the following five issues on appeal:\n\n      1)    The trial court abused its discretion by failing to apply as a\n\nsettlement credit against the damages award the $400,000 that the Sprays\n\nreceived in settlement from Hodnett, Keller Williams/DFW, and Wood.\n\n      2)    The trial court erred by awarding as additional damages under the\n\nDTPA four times the amount of actual damages.\n\n      3)    The trial court erred in calculating pre- and post-judgment interest,\n\nresulting in an excessive and usurious interest award.\n\n      4)    The Sprays’ awards of mental anguish damages are not supported\n\nby legally sufficient evidence.\n\n      5)    The actual damages award is not supported by legally or factually\n\nsufficient evidence because it includes $15,000 in repair costs that are\n\nunrelated to the Sprays’ DTPA claims.\n\n                         III.     SETTLEMENT CREDIT\n\n      In their first issue, the Ramseys complain that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by failing to credit against the damages award the $400,000 the\n\nSprays received in settlement.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fA.    Standard of Review\n\n      A trial court’s determination of the existence or amount of a settlement\n\ncredit is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.4 To determine whether a trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion, we must decide whether the trial court acted\n\nwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles; in other words, we must\n\ndecide whether the act was arbitrary or unreasonable.5     An appellate court\n\ncannot conclude that a trial court abused its discretion merely because the\n\nappellate court would have ruled differently in the same circumstances.6\n\n      An abuse of discretion does not occur when the trial court bases its\n\ndecisions on conflicting evidence. 7 Furthermore, an abuse of discretion does\n\nnot occur as long as some evidence of substantive and probative character\n\nexists to support the trial court’s decision.8\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      … Oyster Creek Fin.

Law Governing Settlement Credits\n\n      Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 33 governs settlement\n\ncredits in all tort and DTPA actions. 9 Section 33.012(b) of the code provides:\n\n      If the claimant has settled with one or more persons, the court shall\n      further reduce the amount of damages to be recovered by the\n      claimant with respect to a cause of action by the sum of the dollar\n      amounts of all settlements.10\n\nThis statute is mandatory.11 Because section 33.012(b) calls for settlement\n\ncredits to apply to “damages to be recovered by the claimant,” the credit is\n\napplied to the amount of damages awarded in the judgment, not the amount of\n\ndamages found by the jury.12\n\n\n\n\n      9\n       … Tex.

In the\nRamseys’ motion for suggestion of remittitur, however, they complain that\n“[t]he amount awarded [in the jury verdict] as additional damages is clearly\nexcessive and unlawful because the DTPA specifically provides that additional\ndamages may not exceed ‘more than three times the amount of economic\ndamages’ when the alleged deceptive practice was committed ‘knowingly’”\n(quoting Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(b)(1)). The Ramseys, therefore,\npreserved this issue for our review.\n\n                                         11\n\f     (b) In a suit filed under this section, each consumer who prevails\n     may obtain:\n\n              (1) the amount of economic damages found by the trier of\n              fact. If the trier of fact finds that the conduct of the\n              defendant was committed knowingly, the consumer may also\n              recover damages for mental anguish, as found by the trier of\n              fact, and the trier of fact may award not more than three\n              times the amount of economic damages. 26\n\n     When a trial court awards actual damages on a DTPA claim and, in\n\naddition, awards three times that amount based on the jury’s award of\n\n“additional” damages for a knowing DTPA violation, the result is an award of\n\nfour times the damages amount.27 In such cases, the appellate court should\n\nmodify the judgment “to limit the DTPA award to three times the amount of\n\neconomic damages.” 28\n\n     In this case, the trial court entered judgment awarding the Sprays\n\n$190,445.70 in actual economic damages plus three times that amount, or\n\n$571,337.10. As a result, the trial court awarded the Sprays four times the\n\namount of their economic damages. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\n\n\n     26\n          … Tex. Bus. & Com.

Prejudgment Interest and Treble Damages Under the DTPA\n\n     Section 17.50(b)(1) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code permits\n\nonly economic damages to be trebled on DTPA claims. 35        Section 17.50(e)\n\nstates that “prejudgment interest may not be considered” in computing such\n\ndamages.36 When a trial court calculates “additional” damages under section\n\n17.50(b), the amount of the “additional damages” “is to be based upon the\n\nactual damages only, not actual damages plus prejudgment interest.” 37\n\n     Here, the trial court ordered that the Sprays recover “trebled pre-judgment\n\ninterest of 7.75%” on the actual damages award of $190,445.70 in repair\n\ncosts. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion as a matter of law in\n\nawarding treble prejudgment interest.

Mrs. Spray testified that she has\n\nexperienced “anxious feelings,” “anxiousness, anxieties, frustration, humiliation,\n\n[and] embarrassment,” that she wakes up at night, and that she has not slept\n\n“well” since moving into the house. In addition, although in the past the Sprays\n\nentertained “quite a bit” for Mr. Spray’s work, Mrs. Spray stated that she is\n\nnow “reluctant” to bring people to their house.\n\n      Mrs. Spray also testified at trial that she feels “cheated” and like her soul\n\nhas been “raped.” The situation regarding her house makes her “very angry”\n\nand causes her to “question all the things that [she] believe[s] in and [her]\n\nfaith.” Mrs. Spray stated that there “really hasn't been much quality of life in\n\nthis house” and that it has been “a nightmare” “[t]o an extreme degree.”\n\n      Mrs. Spray cried at trial, stating that her crying was due to the “buildup\n\nof . . . frustration”; she testified that she also has cried in private over the\n\nsituation regarding her house. And Mr. Spray testified at trial that he has seen\n\nMrs. Spray cry “over this problem” on two or three occasions. In addition, Mrs.\n\nSpray testified that she does not feel safe because “there’s carbon monoxide\n\nin the house” and that she suffers from hypertension as a result of the\n\n“emotional issues” she experienced regarding the house.\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to Mrs. Spray, her conclusory\n\ntestimony does not present more than a scintilla of evidence that her alleged\n\n                                       19\n\fmental anguish caused a substantial disruption in her daily routine or amounted\n\nto a “high degree of mental pain and distress” that is more than mere worry,\n\nanxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger.48 Accordingly, we sustain this\n\nportion of the Ramseys’ fourth issue on appeal.\n\nD.

ACTUAL DAMAGES RELATED TO FENCE REPAIR\n\n\n      In their fifth issue, the Ramseys argue that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support $15,000 of the $190,445.70 actual damages\n\naward because $15,000 is attributable to the repair of a hail-damaged fence\n\nand this damage does not relate to the Sprays’ DTPA claim. The Sprays argue\n\nthat the Ramseys did not preserve error on this issue in part because the actual-\n\ndamages question submitted to the jury did not segregate, nor did the Ramseys\n\nask the trial court for it to segregate, the cost to repair the fence from other\n\nactual damages awarded. According to the Sprays, it is therefore impossible\n\nto determine what amount the jury did or did not award for the repair of the\n\nfence.\n\n\n\n\n      49\n       … Latham, 972 S.W.2d at 69–70; see Cont’l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at\n450; Parkway, 901 S.W.2d at 444; Anderson, 118 S.W.3d at 811.\n      50\n         … Because we sustain this issue on other grounds, we do not address,\nand express no opinion regarding, the Ramseys’ contention that the Sprays\nfailed to establish a causal link between the Sprays’ alleged mental anguish and\nthe Ramseys’ DTPA violations.\n\n                                       21\n\f      When a damages question is submitted to the jury that includes multiple\n\npossible elements, to preserve error challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting one but not all of the elements of damages a defendant is required\n\nto object and ask the trial court to either exclude that element from the\n\ndamages question or submit damages elements separately.51\n\n      In this case, the Sprays presented evidence of fence and other repair\n\ncosts to the jury. The Ramseys failed to object to the submission of the actual\n\ndamages question on the ground that it may include fence repair costs.52 They\n\nalso failed to request the submission of an alternate question that either\n\nexcluded or segregated fence repair costs from other actual damages. 5 3\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the Ramseys failed to preserve error regarding the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the portion of the actual damages they\n\n\n\n\n      51\n       … Tagle v.

CONCLUSION\n\n      In conclusion, we hold that the trial court erred by failing to apply\n\n$400,000 in settlement credit against the award of economic damages; by\n\nawarding the Sprays more than three times the amount of their economic\n\ndamages; and by awarding three times the amount of prejudgment interest on\n\nthe Sprays’ actual damages.      We further hold that the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to support the mental anguish damages awards in favor of the\n\nSprays.\n\n      We, therefore, reverse that part of the trial court’s judgment awarding the\n\nSprays their economic damages, and remand that part of the judgment to the\n\ntrial court for recalculation of those damage awards and application of the\n\nsettlement credit, pursuant to this opinion. In addition, we reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s award of “trebled pre-judgment interest of 7.75% from January 24,\n\n2005[,]” assessed on the Sprays’ actual and mental anguish damages, and\n\nrender judgment that they recover interest of 7.75% from January 24, 2005,\n\n\n      54\n           … See Thomas, 895 S.W.2d at 360; Tagle, 155 S.W.3d at 519.\n      55\n        … Because the Ramseys failed to preserve error, we also do not address\ntheir unpreserved claim that the $15,000 cost to repair the fence was not\nreasonable and necessary.\n\n                                       23\n\fonly on the amount of the damages, if any, that they are entitled to recover\n\nupon application of settlement credit.
