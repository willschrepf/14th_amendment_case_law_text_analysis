Hereafter, BAC and\n 8   ReconTrust are referred to collectively as “appellees.”2    We\n 9   AFFIRM.\n10                           I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n11        The following factual narrative is derived from factual\n12   statements in the Nordeens’ Second Amended Complaint and the\n13   exhibits thereto, and the bankruptcy court’s Memorandum Decision\n14   Dismissing Complaint (“Memorandum Decision”) basing its\n15   background discussion on facts alleged in the Second Amended\n16   Complaint.\n17   A.   Loan History\n18        On October 21, 2005, the Nordeens signed a promissory note\n19   for $140,000 (the “Note”), payable to Countrywide Home Loans,\n20   Inc. (“Countrywide”).    The Note provides that: “[The Nordeens]\n21   understand that [Countrywide] may transfer this Note.\n22   [Countrywide] or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who\n23   is entitled to receive payment under this Note is called the\n24   ‘Note Holder.’”\n25        To secure their payment obligations under the Note, on\n26\n27         2\n            BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP merged with Bank of America,\n28   N.A. in July 2011.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f 1   October 21, 2005, the Nordeens also signed a deed of trust (the\n 2   “Trust Deed”) against their rental property in Surprise, Arizona\n 3   (the “Property”).   ReconTrust is the trustee named in the Trust\n 4   Deed, under which the Nordeens “irrevocably grant[ed] and\n 5   convey[ed]” the Property “in trust, with power of sale.”    The\n 6   named Trust Deed beneficiary was Mortgage Electronic Registration\n 7   Systems, Inc. (“MERS”), which was identified as “acting solely as\n 8   a nominee for [Countrywide] and [Countrywide’s] successors and\n 9   assigns.”\n10        The Trust Deed expressly provides:\n11        Borrower [the Nordeens] understands and agrees that\n          MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by\n12        Borrower in this Security Instrument, but, if necessary\n          to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for\n13        Lender [Countrywide] and Lender’s successors and\n          assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those\n14        interests, including, but not limited to, releasing and\n          canceling this Security Instrument.\n15\n          The Trust Deed further provides:\n16\n          The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together\n17        with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more\n          times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might\n18        result in a change in the entity (known as the “Loan\n          Servicer”) that collects Periodic Payments due under\n19        the Note and this Security Instrument and performs\n          other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the\n20        Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law.\n          There also might be one or more changes of the Loan\n21        Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is\n          a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given\n22        written notice of the change which will state the name\n          and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to\n23        which payments should be made and any other information\n          RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer\n24        of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the\n          Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the\n25        purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing\n          obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan\n26        Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer\n          and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless\n27        otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.\n28        On October 30, 2005, the Note was sold to the CWALT 2005-\n\n                                     -3-\n\f 1   73CB REMIC Trust (“CWALT”).\n 2        In December 2008, the Nordeens were unable to make their\n 3   monthly Note payment, apparently as a result of defaulting\n 4   tenants leaving the Property in such bad shape that significant,\n 5   costly repairs were required.   The Nordeens contacted Countrywide\n 6   to see “if they could work anything out,” but Countrywide’s\n 7   representative “said they could do nothing.”    On January 16,\n 8   2009, BAC mailed the Nordeens a notice of intent to accelerate\n 9   the Nordeens’ payment obligations under the Note.    The Nordeens\n10   have not made a payment on the Note obligation since December\n11   2008.\n12        On March 23, 2009, ReconTrust initiated foreclosure\n13   proceedings with respect to the Property.     On May 29, 2009, the\n14   Nordeens sent what they characterized as a Qualified Written\n15   Request under RESPA3 to BAC and ReconTrust.\n16        ReconTrust initially responded to the Nordeens’ request for\n17   information.   In its response, ReconTrust apparently included\n18\n             3\n19          For purposes of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act\n     (“RESPA”), 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2617, a “qualified written request”\n20   consists of:\n21        [W]ritten correspondence, other than notice on a\n22        payment coupon or other payment medium supplied by the\n          [loan] servicer, that–\n23        (i) includes, or otherwise enables the servicer to\n          identify, the name and account of the borrower; and\n24\n          (ii) includes a statement of the reasons for the belief\n25        of the borrower, to the extent applicable, that the\n          account is in error or provides sufficient detail to\n26        the servicer regarding other information sought by the\n27        borrower.\n\n28   12 U.S.C. § 2605(e)(1)(B).\n\n                                     -4-\n\f 1   copies of the Note and Trust Deed and a payment history\n 2   corresponding to the Nordeens’ account.   ReconTrust also\n 3   explained that, despite the Nordeens’ apparent assertions to the\n 4   contrary, the Note and Trust Deed remained enforceable as\n 5   written.   Ultimately, in response to further communications from\n 6   the Nordeens over a number of months, BAC apparently advised the\n 7   Nordeens that payments on the Note were due and owing for\n 8   December 2008 through April 2010, and a foreclosure sale was\n 9   scheduled for May 18, 2010.   No foreclosure sale of the Property\n10   has occurred to date.\n11   B.   Bankruptcy Proceedings\n12        On June 28, 2009, the Nordeens filed for protection under\n13   chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.4   On August 7, 2009, BAC filed\n14   a proof of secured claim in the Nordeens’ bankruptcy case.\n15        On March 3, 2011, the Nordeens, acting pro se, filed an\n16   adversary proceeding complaint (“Initial Complaint”) against the\n17   appellees.   In the Initial Complaint, the Nordeens asserted\n18   claims for declaratory relief, fraud, quiet title, and violations\n19   of RESPA, the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-\n20   1667f, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), 15\n21   U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692p.   A prominent feature of the Initial\n22   Complaint was the Nordeens’ theory (the “Securitization Theory”)\n23   that the securitization of the Note and sale to CWALT constituted\n24\n25\n           4\n            Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n26   references are to the federal Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-\n27   1532, and all “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of\n     Bankruptcy Procedure, Rules 1001-9037. The Federal Rules of\n28   Civil Procedure are referred to as “Civil Rules.”\n\n                                     -5-\n\f 1   a “true sale” of the Note that vitiated its effectiveness as to\n 2   them and rendered the Trust Deed unenforceable as to the\n 3   Property.   The Nordeens also argued that the appellees had\n 4   somehow fabricated the version of the Note that they were trying\n 5   to enforce against the Nordeens.\n 6        On June 6, 2011, the appellees moved to dismiss the Initial\n 7   Complaint with prejudice under Civil Rule 12(b)(6).    After a\n 8   hearing on the motion on July 26, 2011 (“July 26th Hearing”), the\n 9   bankruptcy court granted the motion to dismiss in part but\n10   granted the Nordeens leave to amend their complaint.    At the\n11   July 26th Hearing, after hearing argument from the parties, the\n12   bankruptcy court rejected the Nordeens’ Securitization Theory but\n13   granted the Nordeens leave to amend their claim for declaratory\n14   relief “so you can sort out who’s got what note.”   The Nordeens’\n15   other claims were dismissed without leave to amend.    On August 8,\n16   2011, the bankruptcy court entered its order on the appellees’\n17   motion to dismiss the Initial Complaint, providing that\n18   “Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED; IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the\n19   Plaintiffs shall have leave until August 26, 2011 to file an\n20   amended complaint to assert a declaratory relief action; . . . .”\n21        On August 8, 2011, the Nordeens moved for reconsideration of\n22   the bankruptcy court’s order on appellees’ motion to dismiss and\n23   filed a “disapproval to order on motion to dismiss that attorneys\n24   have done for the court.”   The Nordeens further filed a first\n25   amended complaint (“First Amended Complaint”) on August 26, 2011.\n26        The bankruptcy court held a hearing on September 13, 2011\n27   (“September 13th Hearing”), to consider outstanding issues\n28   between the parties, including the Nordeens’ motion for\n\n                                     -6-\n\f 1   reconsideration of the prior dismissal order.       At the September\n 2   13th Hearing, the bankruptcy court reiterated to the Nordeens\n 3   that claims based on their Securitization Theory were not viable.\n 4   They could replead a more limited declaratory relief claim based\n 5   upon their allegations that the appellees were trying to collect\n 6   on the wrong Note.       However, if the Nordeens wanted to assert\n 7   additional claims for relief, they would need to file a motion to\n 8   amend their complaint.       But, the bankruptcy court cautioned, “You\n 9   [the Nordeens] can’t bring back the causes of action I’ve already\n10   dismissed.”       Ultimately, the bankruptcy court granted the\n11   Nordeens leave to file a second amended complaint.\n12        The bankruptcy court entered an order denying the Nordeens’\n13   motion for reconsideration of the order on appellees’ original\n14   motion to dismiss (the “Reconsideration Order”) on September 21,\n15   2011.       In the Reconsideration Order, the bankruptcy court granted\n16   the Nordeens until October 11, 2011 to file their second amended\n17   complaint but further ordered that “no further leave to file\n18   additional amended complaints shall be granted.”\n19        On October 11, 2011, the Nordeens filed their second amended\n20   complaint (“Second Amended Complaint”).       In the Second Amended\n21   Complaint, the Nordeens again focused on their Securitization\n22   Theory, asserting claims under that umbrella for declaratory\n23   relief, fraud, perjury, “material facts as to contracts,\n24   securities, and as to pleading, and practice,” “federal laws UCC-\n25   3 [and] UCC-9,” “possible collusion, RICO Act5 and possible\n26\n27           5\n            The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n28   (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968.\n\n                                         -7-\n\f 1   counterfeiting,” and “housing laws.”\n 2        The appellees filed an answer to the Second Amended\n 3   Complaint on November 8, 2011.      Following substantial discovery,\n 4   on May 8, 2012, the appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings\n 5   (“Pleadings Judgment Motion”) under Civil Rule 12(c).        The\n 6   Nordeens filed an opposition to the Pleadings Judgment Motion on\n 7   May 29, 2012, to which the appellees replied on June 5, 2012.\n 8        The bankruptcy court heard the Pleadings Judgment Motion on\n 9   June 12, 2012 (“June 12th Hearing”).      At the June 12th Hearing,\n10   after hearing argument from the parties, the bankruptcy court\n11   took the Pleadings Judgment Motion under advisement.        On\n12   August 10, 2012, the bankruptcy court issued its Memorandum\n13   Decision.   On the same date, for the reasons stated in the\n14   Memorandum Decision, the bankruptcy court entered an order\n15   dismissing the Second Amended Complaint with prejudice.          The\n16   Nordeens filed a timely Notice of Appeal on August 23, 2012.\n17                               II.   JURISDICTION\n18        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n19   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(B), (K) and (O).        We have\n20   jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158.\n21                        III.    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n22        We review a bankruptcy court’s decision to grant a motion to\n23   dismiss an adversary complaint on the pleadings de novo.          Henry\n24   A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 998 (9th Cir. 2012); Movsesian v.\n25   Victoria Versicherung AG, 670 F.3d 1067, 1071 (9th Cir. 2012) (en\n26   banc).   De novo means that we examine a matter anew, as if no\n27   decision previously had been rendered, giving no deference to the\n28   bankruptcy court’s prior determinations.         Dawson v. Marshall, 561\n\n                                         -8-\n\f 1   F.3d 930, 933 (9th Cir. 2009).    “We accept as true all well\n 2   pleaded facts in the complaint and construe them in the light\n 3   most favorable to the nonmoving party.”     Henry A. v. Willden, 678\n 4   F.3d at 998 (citation omitted).\n 5        We review the bankruptcy court’s decision to dismiss an\n 6   adversary complaint without leave to amend for an abuse of\n 7   discretion.   Id.   A bankruptcy court abuses its discretion only\n 8   if it applies the wrong legal standard or if its factual findings\n 9   are illogical, implausible or without support in the evidentiary\n10   record before it.   TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653\n11   F.3d 820, 832 (9th Cir. 2011).\n12        We may affirm the bankruptcy court’s decisions on any\n13   grounds supported by the record.    Shanks v. Dressel, 540 F.3d\n14   1082, 1086 (9th Cir. 2008).\n15                               IV.   ISSUES6\n16        1.   Did the bankruptcy court err in applying an incorrect\n17   legal standard to its review of the Second Amended Complaint in\n18   granting the Pleadings Judgment Motion?\n19        2.

DISCUSSION\n20   1) Standards for consideration of a motion to dismiss\n21        As the bankruptcy court noted in the Memorandum Decision, it\n22   “evaluates motions for judgment on the pleadings under Rule\n23   7012(b), which incorporates Civil Rule 12(c).”   Rule 7012(b)\n24   (Civil Rule 12(b)-(i) apply in adversary proceedings in\n25   bankruptcy).    Where the defense of failure to state a claim upon\n26   which relief can be granted is raised in a Civil Rule 12(c)\n27   motion, the legal test applied is the same as if the defense had\n28   been raised earlier in a motion to dismiss under Civil Rule\n\n                                      -10-\n\f 1   12(b)(6).   McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802, 810\n 2   (9th Cir. 1988).\n 3        In reviewing the bankruptcy court’s dismissal of the Second\n 4   Amended Complaint, we start from the proposition that complaints\n 5   prepared by pro se parties must be construed liberally, and we\n 6   have a duty to ensure that “pro se litigants do not lose their\n 7   right to a hearing on the merits of their claim due to ignorance\n 8   of technical procedural requirements.”   Balistreri v. Pacifica\n 9   Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).   As stated by\n10   the Supreme Court in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976):\n11        As the Court unanimously held in Haines v. Kerner, 404\n          U.S. 519 (1972), a pro se complaint, “however\n12        inartfully pleaded,” must be held to “less stringent\n          standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers” and\n13        can only be dismissed for failure to state a claim if\n          it appears “‘beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove\n14        no set of facts in support of his claim which would\n          entitle him to relief.’” (Citations omitted.)\n15\n16   However, no matter how a complaint is worded, ultimately it must\n17   state a legally cognizable claim entitling the claimant to some\n18   relief in order to survive a motion to dismiss.    See id. at 107\n19   (“Even applying these liberal standards, however, Gamble’s claims\n20   against Dr. Gray, both in his capacity as treating physician and\n21   as medical director of the Corrections Department, are not\n22   cognizable under § 1983.”).\n23        Civil Rule 8 sets forth general rules for pleading in\n24   federal court litigation.   “The pleading provisions in the Civil\n25   Rules are intended to provide parties with adequate notice of the\n26   opposing party’s claims or defenses.”    Charlie Y., Inc. v. Carey\n27   (In re Carey), 446 B.R. 384, 391 (9th Cir. BAP 2011).   Civil Rule\n28   8(a)(2), applicable in adversary proceedings in bankruptcy under\n\n                                    -11-\n\f 1   Rule 7008, provides that a claim for relief must contain “a short\n 2   and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n 3   entitled to relief.”\n 4        The factual allegations in a complaint “must be enough to\n 5   raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” Bell Atl.\n 6   Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), and must be\n 7   sufficient to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\n 8   face.”   Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009), quoting Bell\n 9   Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.   “A claim has facial\n10   plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that\n11   allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n12   defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”   Ashcroft v.\n13   Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.   The bankruptcy court explicitly\n14   recognized the application of these standards to its\n15   consideration of the Pleadings Judgment Motion.    See Memorandum\n16   Decision, at pp. 6-7.   It also recognized, however, that although\n17   it was required to “take all the factual allegations in the\n18   complaint as true, we are not bound to accept as true a legal\n19   conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”   Papasan v. Allain,\n20   478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).   Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n21   at 555 (A claim for relief “requires more than labels and\n22   conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a\n23   cause of action will not do.”).\n24        The bankruptcy court clearly applied the correct legal\n25   standards to its consideration of the Pleadings Judgment Motion.\n26   The Nordeens complain in the statement of issues in their Opening\n27   Brief that the bankruptcy court treated all of their factual\n28   allegations as “nothing more than labels and conclusions and mere\n\n                                    -12-\n\f 1   conclusory statements or legal characterizations cast in the form\n 2   of factual allegations.”    Appellants’ Opening Brief, at 1.   Yet,\n 3   nowhere in their Opening Brief do the Nordeens cite one example\n 4   of where the bankruptcy court erred in so characterizing their\n 5   factual allegations as legal conclusions.    We perceive no such\n 6   error in the bankruptcy court’s consideration of the Nordeens’\n 7   factual allegations in its analysis set forth in the Memorandum\n 8   Decision.\n 9\n     2) Timing of the bankruptcy court’s consideration of the\n10   Pleadings Judgment Motion\n11        Although their argument as to the timing of the bankruptcy\n12   court’s consideration of the Pleadings Judgment Motion is less\n13   than clear (see Appellants’ Opening Brief, at 1 and 11-12), the\n14   Nordeens appear to argue that the bankruptcy court erred in\n15   considering the Pleadings Judgment Motion after 1) all of the\n16   pleadings had been settled, 2) the parties had agreed on a\n17   scheduling plan and had engaged in substantial discovery, and 3)\n18   September 24, 2012 had been set as the trial date.    In essence,\n19   the argument is, after all that had been accomplished in the\n20   adversary proceeding, the bankruptcy court should have tried it\n21   rather than dismissing it in response to the Pleadings Judgment\n22   Motion.\n23        Civil Rule 12(c) provides that, “After the pleadings are\n24   closed–but early enough not to delay trial–a party may move for\n25   judgment on the pleadings.”    (Emphasis added.)   We emphasize that\n26   under Civil Rule 12(c), it was not for the bankruptcy court to\n27   raise the issue of the appropriateness of granting judgment on\n28   the pleadings sua sponte.    Under the rule, the bankruptcy court\n\n                                     -13-\n\f 1   could not consider such a motion until brought by an interested\n 2   party, in this case, the appellees.    The bankruptcy court did not\n 3   consider the Pleadings Judgment Motion until after it was filed,\n 4   the Nordeens had an opportunity to respond, and the bankruptcy\n 5   court heard argument at the June 12th Hearing.    The bankruptcy\n 6   court’s decision to grant the Pleadings Judgment Motion with\n 7   prejudice did not “delay” the trial.    Rather it avoided a trial\n 8   that the bankruptcy court determined was unwarranted because the\n 9   Nordeens had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\n10   granted.   Based on this record, we conclude that the bankruptcy\n11   court did not err in acting consistently with the provisions of\n12   Civil Rule 12(c).\n13\n     3) The bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting the Nordeens’\n14   Securitization Theory.\n15        As early as the July 26th Hearing, the bankruptcy court\n16   advised the Nordeens that their Securitization Theory was not\n17   viable and dismissed the Nordeens’ claims based on the\n18   Securitization Theory.    Yet, in every iteration of their\n19   complaint filed since then, including the Second Amended\n20   Complaint that the bankruptcy court ultimately dismissed with\n21   prejudice, the Nordeens have extensively repeated their\n22   Securitization Theory allegations in the service of their\n23   ultimate objectives: “[The Nordeens] want to restraint [sic] all\n24   parties from ever going after [the Nordeens] again and to declare\n25   this contract [the Note and the Trust Deed] void.”    Appellants’\n26   Opening Brief, at 10.    “[The Nordeens] want to prevent all\n27   parties from ever attempting to foreclose on us again.”\n28   Appellants’ Opening Brief, at 30.\n\n                                     -14-\n\f 1        The bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting and in\n 2   dismissing the Nordeens’ claims based on their Securitization\n 3   Theory, and its rulings are consistent with repeated\n 4   determinations of the district courts sitting in Nevada and\n 5   Arizona and elsewhere in the Ninth Circuit.   See, e.g., Albritton\n 6   v. Tiffany & Bosco, P.A., 2013 WL 3153848, at *8 (D. Ariz.\n 7   June 19, 2013); Hagos v. MTC Financial, Inc., 2013 WL 1292703 (D.\n 8   Nev. March 29, 2013); Joson v. Bank of Am., NA, 2013 WL 1249714\n 9   (D. Nev. March 22, 2013); Banks v. Freddie Mac, 2013 WL 1182685\n10   (D. Nev. March 20, 2013); Lowry v. EMC Mortg. Corp., 2013 WL\n11   841326 (D. Ariz. March 6, 2013); Reyes v. GMAC Mortg. LLC, 2011\n12   WL 1322775, at *2, *3 (D. Nev. April 5, 2011) and cases cited\n13   therein:\n14        [F]ive of plaintiffs’ claims are based on the idea that\n          securitization inherently changes the “existing legal\n15        relationship between the parties to the extent that the\n          original parties cease to occupy the roles they did at\n16        the closing.” . . . This argument has been rejected in\n          this district, because the securitization of a loan\n17        does not in fact alter or affect the legal\n          beneficiary’s standing to enforce the deed of trust.\n18\n19   Joyner v. Bank of Am. Home Loans, 2010 WL 2953969, at *1, *5, *6\n20   (D. Nev. July 26, 2010):\n21        Each of these ideas [based on the Securitization\n          Theory] has been addressed on multiple occasions by\n22        this Court, weighed and found wanting.\n          . . .\n23        This Court rejects the notion, as it has previously,\n          that “transfer of a promissory note causes prior\n24        security instruments to auto-nullify unless\n          reexecuted.” (Citation omitted.)\n25        . . .\n          Plaintiff has not tendered the amount owed on the loan.\n26        Rather, he argues that [Bank of America] received the\n          full amount of the loan when it securitized the loan\n27        and therefore Plaintiff has no further obligations\n          under the loan. This argument is completely without\n28        merit.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f 1   Das v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 2012 WL 1658718, at *1 (D.\n 2   Ariz. May 11, 2012); Kuc v. Bank of Am., NA, 2012 WL 1268126,\n 3   at *3 (D. Ariz. April 16, 2012) (“[T]he theory that\n 4   securitization renders the Deed of Trust unenforceable has been\n 5   repeatedly rejected.”); White v. Indymac Bank, FSB, 2012 WL\n 6   966638, at *6 (D. Haw. March 20, 2012) (“The argument that\n 7   parties lose their interest in a loan when it is assigned to a\n 8   securitization trust or REMIC has been rejected by numerous\n 9   courts.”); Washburn v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2011 WL 7053617, at *5\n10   (D. Idaho Oct. 21, 2011) (“This is not a new battlefield.\n11   Several courts have rejected various theories that\n12   ‘securitization of a loan somehow diminishes the underlying power\n13   of sale that can be exercised upon a trustor’s breach.’”\n14   (citations omitted)); Lane v. Vitek Real Estate Indus. Group, 713\n15   F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1099 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (“The argument that\n16   parties lose their interest in a loan when it is assigned to a\n17   trust pool has also been rejected by many district courts.”).\n18   The Nordeens cite no contrary authority from court decisions.\n19        The definition of a “security” in the Securities Exchange\n20   Act of 1934 is very broad and includes promissory notes.    See 15\n21   U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10); Marine Bank v. Weaver, 455 U.S. 551, 555 &\n22   n.3 (1982).   However, until fairly recently, most promissory\n23   notes, including notes secured by mortgages on homes, were not\n24   considered to be securities.   See, e.g., Reves v. Ernst & Young,\n25   494 U.S. 56, 65 (1990), citing Exchange Nat’l Bank of Chi. v.\n26   Touche Ross & Co., 544 F.2d 1126, 1138 (2d Cir. 1976).   Now, when\n27   a vast market has been established for mortgage-backed\n28   securities, that view seems quaint.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f 1        However, home loan borrowers are not purchasing an\n 2   investment when they enter into a loan agreement to purchase or\n 3   refinance a home.   When they sign a promissory note and mortgage\n 4   or trust deed secured by their real property, they are entering\n 5   into a contract for a loan transaction on fixed terms, and any\n 6   “upside” or investment incentive to enter into the transaction is\n 7   based on a prospective increase in the value of the subject real\n 8   property.   Accordingly, the borrower’s loan contract (the Note\n 9   and Trust Deed in this appeal) is distinct and separate from any\n10   securities transaction in the “secondary market” encompassing\n11   assignment of the contract.   The Note in this case documents this\n12   distinction in its provisions that, “[The Nordeens] understand\n13   that [Countrywide] may transfer this Note.   [Countrywide] or\n14   anyone else who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled\n15   to receive payments under this Note is called the ‘Note Holder.’”\n16   Likewise, the Trust Deed provides that, “The Note or a partial\n17   interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can\n18   be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower.”\n19   (Emphasis added.)   This distinction between the “loan” contract\n20   and the “securitization” contract has been recognized by the\n21   courts that have rejected the Securitization Theory.   See, e.g.,\n22   Reyes v. GMAC Mortg. LLC, 2011 WL 1322775, at *3:\n23        Since the securitization “merely creates a ‘separate\n          contract, distinct from [plaintiffs’] debt\n24        obligations’” under the note and does not change the\n          relationship of the parties in any way, plaintiffs’\n25        claims arising out of the securitization fail.\n          Commonwealth Prop. Advocates, LLC v. First Horizon Home\n26        Loan Corp., . . . 2010 WL 4788209, at *4 (D. Utah Nov.\n          16, 2010) . . . (quoting Larota-Florez v. Goldman Sachs\n27        Mortgage Co., 719 F. Supp. 2d 636, 642 (E.D. Va. 2010).\n          Further, as plaintiffs consented to the securitization\n28        in the agreement by explicitly agreeing that they\n\n                                    -17-\n\f 1        “understand that the [l]ender may transfer this\n          [n]ote,” their assertion that they did not consent also\n 2        fails. See Suss v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., . . .\n          [2010] WL 2733097, *6 . . . (D. Md. 2010) (court\n 3        rejected plaintiff’s argument that he did not consent\n          to securitization because the note contained such\n 4        consent). (Emphasis added.)\n 5        As long as a borrower in such circumstances makes all of the\n 6   scheduled promissory note payments to a loan servicer, the\n 7   contract functions seamlessly (at least theoretically), and the\n 8   borrower may never know (or have any reason to know) who ends up\n 9   owning the note.   The problem arises, as in this case, when a\n10   borrower faces difficulties making loan payments and needs to\n11   enter into constructive negotiations with the lender to\n12   restructure the loan to make it work for both parties.    As the\n13   Nordeens discovered, to their increasing frustration and anguish\n14   over time, it is difficult to make contact with decision makers\n15   for a securitized loan, and the reaction of loan servicer\n16   representatives in our experience often has been exactly the\n17   response the Nordeens received to their pleas: “We can do\n18   nothing.”   Foreclosure ensues.\n19        Various attempts to amend the Bankruptcy Code to give\n20   bankruptcy courts the authority to modify mortgage or trust deed\n21   secured loans to reflect the reality of declining real property\n22   values have been made, without success to date.   That leaves\n23   parties, like the Nordeens, in the situation where they often\n24   have no legal remedy to the perceived ills and unfairness\n25   resulting from the securitization of their Note and Trust Deed.\n26   While we are sympathetic to the Nordeens’ plight, we agree with\n27   the bankruptcy court that claims based on the Nordeens’\n28   Securitization Theory are not viable in this case.   As bankruptcy\n\n                                       -18-\n\f 1   courts, unfortunately, we have no general authority to require\n 2   lenders or loan servicers to behave reasonably.\n 3        Contrary to the Nordeens’ assertion that the bankruptcy\n 4   court violated their rights to due process by not allowing them\n 5   to present securitization-based claims (see Appellants’ Opening\n 6   Brief, at 2, 22-23), the bankruptcy court properly dismissed\n 7   their Securitization Theory arguments that did not assert a\n 8   legally cognizable claim.   The bankruptcy court clearly told the\n 9   Nordeens at an early stage in the proceedings that their\n10   Securitization Theory claims were not viable and dismissed them,\n11   but the Nordeens kept pleading them anyway.\n12\n     4) The Nordeens’ further claims for declaratory relief based on\n13   alleged fabrications of the Note are not viable.\n14        At the July 26th Hearing and the September 13th Hearing, the\n15   bankruptcy court considered and allowed the Nordeens to amend and\n16   restate their claim for declaratory relief based on their\n17   expressed concerns as to whom they owed an obligation to pay and\n18   issues as to alleged fabrication of the Note.   As noted by the\n19   bankruptcy court in the Memorandum Decision, at p. 8:\n20        Declaratory relief is appropriate “(1) when the\n          judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and\n21        settling the legal relations in issue, and (2) when it\n          will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty,\n22        insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the\n          proceeding.” McGraw-Edison Co. v. Preformed Line\n23        Products, Co., 362 F.2d 339, 342 (9th Cir. 1966)\n          (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n24\n25        The problem for the Nordeens is that ultimately, shorn of\n26   the permeating Securitization Theory claims that we previously\n27   have concluded are not viable, the declaratory relief claim\n28   stated in the Second Amended Complaint has no substance.    Aside\n\n                                    -19-\n\f 1   from questions relating to who is entitled to enforce the Trust\n 2   Deed obligations, discussed infra, the Nordeens rely on\n 3   allegations that the appellees have produced a “false and\n 4   fabricated” Note.   Helpfully, the Nordeens attached as Exhibit O\n 5   to the Second Amended Complaint a “Certified Copy of the Note\n 6   that [the Nordeens] closed with [and signed] on October 21, 2005\n 7   and took . . . home with them” (the “Genuine Note”), and as\n 8   Exhibit P to the Second Amended Complaint “the fabricated copy of\n 9   [the Nordeens’] Note that has been presented in this court as the\n10   ‘original’ and as a ‘copy’” (the “Bogus Note”).\n11        The differences between the Genuine Note and the Bogus Note\n12   are detailed by the Nordeens as follows: 1) In the upper left\n13   hand corner of the first page of the Genuine Note, it states\n14   “Prepared by MARGARITA RUIZ;” the Bogus Note states “Prepared by\n15   REMEDIOS BROWN.”    2) The Nordeens assert that their initials are\n16   “different” and in different places on the two note exhibits.\n17   3) The “supposed signatures” on the Bogus Note “are not the\n18   same.”   4) The color of ink on the Bogus Note, presented as the\n19   original Note at the July 26th Hearing, is a “strange light\n20   blue.”   5) There are orange highlighter marks under the\n21   signatures and initials on the Bogus Note.   6) The\n22   “Certification” on the Bogus Note is allegedly different from the\n23   “Certification” on the Genuine Note, as appearing to be “in a\n24   different place and appear[ing] to be signed by a different\n25   person.”   (Actually, the only “certification” on Exhibit O that\n26   we see is the “true copy” certification on page one of Exhibit O.\n27   No such certification appears on Exhibit P.)   7) Finally,\n28   “[t]here are other variations with completely different barcodes\n\n                                     -20-\n\f 1   and redactions and punch holes that could indicate multiple\n 2   pledges or sales of this mis-represented [sic] fabricated Note\n 3   but none that are the [Nordeens’] Certified copy from closing.”\n 4   Second Amended Complaint, ¶ 96-97, pp. 26-28; Exhibits O and P.\n 5        Conspicuously absent from the Nordeens’ allegations in the\n 6   Second Amended Complaint is any allegation that the terms of the\n 7   Genuine Note and the Bogus Note are different in any respect.      In\n 8   addition, although the Nordeens cannot quite bring themselves to\n 9   state that they signed the Note in their description of the\n10   Genuine Note, they admitted earlier in the Second Amended\n11   Complaint that they signed the Note.    See Second Amended\n12   Complaint, ¶ 15, p. 6.   The Nordeens further do not deny that the\n13   initials and the signatures on the Genuine Note are theirs.    At\n14   the July 26th Hearing, counsel for the appellees addressed the\n15   differences between copies of the Note as follows:\n16        From what I can tell from looking at those notes, the\n          major differentiations were things that happen when you\n17        copy notes that have been highlighted, when you copy\n          notes where redactions have taken place, when notes get\n18        copied and placed in binders, and hole punches get put\n          through the notes.\n19             I was hoping to put all of that to rest by\n          bringing the original note with me today, and . . . .\n20\n21   July 26th, 2011 Hr’g Tr., at 29:7-13.\n22        However, whatever explanation applies with respect to the\n23   alleged discrepancies between the Genuine Note and the Bogus Note\n24   noted by the Nordeens is beside the point in this appeal.    What\n25   is important is the substance of the alleged differences, and as\n26   a bottom line matter, the Nordeens’ allegations about different\n27   Notes make no substantive difference.    See, e.g., Donaldson v.\n28   BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., 813 F. Supp. 2d 885, 894 (M.D.\n\n                                    -21-\n\f 1   Tenn. 2011) (“Plaintiff claims that the fact that [d]efendant is\n 2   able to produce multiple copies of the alleged original documents\n 3   ‘with different markings, endorsements, bar codes, signatures,\n 4   and etc.’ is evidence that it does not possess any of the\n 5   original documents. . . . The Court finds this argument to be\n 6   meritless.”).\n 7        Section 3-309 of the Uniform Commercial Code provides for\n 8   enforcement of “lost, destroyed or stolen” promissory notes by a\n 9   person not in possession of the original promissory note when the\n10   subject person was entitled to enforce the note when the loss\n11   occurred, and the terms of the note can be proved.   See Nevada\n12   Revised Statutes (“NRS”) § 104.3309.7\n13\n          7\n14          NRS § 104-3309, entitled “Enforcement of lost, destroyed\n     or stolen instrument,” provides in relevant part as follows:\n15\n          1. A person not in possession of an instrument is\n16\n          entitled to enforce the instrument if:\n17        (a) The person seeking to enforce the instrument:\n                (1) Was entitled to enforce the instrument when\n18        loss of possession occurred; or\n19              (2) Has directly or indirectly acquired ownership\n          of the instrument from a person who was entitled to\n20        enforce the instrument when loss of possession\n          occurred;\n21        . . .\n22        2. A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under\n          subsection 1 must prove the terms of the instrument and\n23        his or her right to enforce the instrument. If that\n          proof is made, NRS 104.3308 applies to the case as if\n24\n          the person seeking enforcement had produced the\n25        instrument. . . .\n26        Arizona law does not apply with respect to the Nordeens’\n27   declaratory relief claim based on the appellees’ alleged\n     fabrication of the Note. See n.7 infra. However, in any event,\n28                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                   -22-\n\f 1         Even if the original Note were lost, a point not conceded by\n 2   the appellees, no proof of the terms of the Note is required\n 3   because there is no difference in terms between the Genuine Note\n 4   and the Bogus Note.      As to the right to enforce, the Nordeens’\n 5   allegations in that regard arise from their Securitization Theory\n 6   that we previously have determined to be nonviable.      The Nordeens\n 7   do not challenge the form of the endorsement in blank on the\n 8   alleged Bogus Note.      While the Note was transferred at an early\n 9   stage from Countrywide to CWALT, the record reflects that the\n10   Nordeens have always dealt with BAC, formerly known as\n11   Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP, as their loan servicer, and\n12   ReconTrust has always served as the named trustee in the Trust\n13   Deed.       In their opening brief, the Nordeens concede that BAC has\n14   operated as their loan servicer.      Appellants’ Opening Brief, at\n15   16.\n16         The bankruptcy court raised a red herring when it gave as\n17   one of the bases for its dismissal of the declaratory judgment\n18   claim “the absence of any allegation [by the Nordeens] that they\n19   have placed funds into a segregated account in anticipation of\n20   the day when the proper payee is revealed,” but it did not err in\n21   concluding that the motivation of the Nordeens was to invalidate\n22   the Note so that any obligations reflected in the terms of the\n23   Note are unenforceable.      See Memorandum Decision, at pp. 8-9.\n24\n25\n             7\n           (...continued)\n26   Arizona Uniform Commercial Code law with respect to enforcement\n27   of “lost, destroyed or stolen” instruments is essentially the\n     same as Nevada’s. See Arizona Revised Statutes (“A.R.S.”)\n28   § 47-3309.\n\n                                        -23-\n\f 1   The Nordeens have admitted as much.   See Appellants’ Opening\n 2   Brief at 10.   However, the claim for declaratory relief in the\n 3   Second Amended Complaint is inadequate to accomplish that\n 4   objective, and the bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing it.\n 5   5) Fraud\n 6        While, as we have emphasized above, we construe pro se\n 7   pleadings liberally, Hebbe v. Pliler, 627 F.3d 338, 342 (9th Cir.\n 8   2010), Civil Rule 9(b), applicable in this adversary proceeding\n 9   under Rule 7009, requires that, “In alleging fraud or mistake, a\n10   party must state with particularity the circumstances\n11   constituting fraud or mistake.”   Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA,\n12   317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (“It is established law, in\n13   this circuit and elsewhere, that [Civil] Rule 9(b)’s\n14   particularity requirement applies to state-law causes of\n15   action.”).\n16        Under Nevada law,8 applicable in construing the Nordeens’\n17\n18        8\n            The Nordeens reside in Nevada. They signed the Note and\n19   Trust Deed in Nevada. BAC sent the Nordeens their monthly\n     billing statements and the notices of foreclosure on the Property\n20   to the Nordeens’ residence in Nevada. The Nordeens further filed\n     their bankruptcy case and the subject adversary proceeding in\n21   Nevada. In these circumstances, the bankruptcy court properly\n22   applied Nevada law, as the law of the forum, to the Nordeens’\n     nonbankruptcy state law claims that do not relate specifically to\n23   rights to foreclose with respect to the Property. See, e.g.,\n     Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 465 (1965) (“[F]ederal courts are\n24\n     to apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.”);\n25   Vacation Vill., Inc. v. Clark Cnty., Nev., 497 F.3d 902, 914 (9th\n     Cir. 2007); Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d at 1103 (“[A]\n26   federal court will examine state law to determine whether the\n27   elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of\n     action . . . .”); Rubenstein v. Ball Bros., Inc.

Reno Air, Inc., 114 Nev. 441, 446-47, 956 P.2d\n 9   1382, 1386 (Nev. 1998).   An omission to state a material fact\n10   “which a party is bound in good faith to disclose is equivalent\n11   to a false representation, since it constitutes an indirect\n12   representation that such fact does not exist.”   Nelson v. Heer,\n13   123 Nev. 217, 225, 163 P.3d 420, 426 (Nev. 2007) (internal\n14   quotation marks omitted).   “Where an essential element of a claim\n15   for relief is absent, the facts, disputed or otherwise, as to\n16   other elements are rendered immaterial,” and summary adjudication\n17   is appropriate.   Bulbman, Inc. v. Nev. Bell, 108 Nev. 105, 111,\n18   825 P.2d 588, 592 (Nev. 1992).\n19        The Nordeens’ allegations in support of their fraud claim\n20   reference various communications raising questions as to who was\n21   the Note Holder and who were the beneficiary and trustee under\n22   the Trust Deed.   The alleged communications were made at various\n23   times in 2009 and 2010.   Whatever confusion may have resulted\n24\n          8\n25         (...continued)\n     England Fish Co.), 749 F.2d 1277, 1280-81 (9th Cir. 1984) (“In\n26   deciding questions of state law, a bankruptcy court should apply\n27   the law that a court of the forum state would apply.”) (emphasis\n     added); Gen. Motors Corp. v. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. of Nev., 122\n28   Nev. 466, 473-74, 134 P.3d 111, 116 (Nev. 2006).\n\n                                      -25-\n\f 1   from the alleged communications, the Nordeens cannot have relied\n 2   on any of the alleged communications on October 21, 2005, when\n 3   they signed the Note and Trust Deed.   And since they ceased\n 4   making payments on the Note obligation in December 2008, they can\n 5   assert no damages from the alleged communications.    They have not\n 6   alleged that any of the payments they made on the Note obligation\n 7   prior to December 2008 were misapplied.   Accordingly, the\n 8   Nordeens cannot assert either that the allegedly fraudulent\n 9   communications from the appellees induced actual reliance on\n10   their parts or that damages resulted therefrom, essential\n11   elements of a fraud claim under Nevada law.\n12        The Nordeens argue that the bankruptcy court erred in\n13   applying Nevada law rather than federal law in considering their\n14   fraud claim.   We disagree.   See authorities cited in n.7 supra.\n15   However, even if federal law applied, it would not help the\n16   Nordeens.\n17        The federal standard for fraud is a five-element test:\n18   1) misrepresentation, fraudulent omission or deceptive conduct by\n19   the offending party; 2) knowledge of the falsity or deceptiveness\n20   of the statement or conduct; 3) an intent to deceive;\n21   4) justifiable reliance by the claimant on such statement or\n22   conduct; and 5) damage to the claimant proximately caused by\n23   claimant’s reliance on such statement or conduct.    Ghomeshi v.\n24   Sabban (In re Sabban), 600 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir. 2010); Oney\n25   v. Weinberg (In re Weinberg), 410 B.R. 19, 35 (9th Cir. BAP\n26   2009).   The claimant bears the burden of proof on each of those\n27   five elements.\n28        The Nordeens face the same irremediable impediments to\n\n                                     -26-\n\f 1   stating plausible claims of reliance and proximate causation of\n 2   damages under the federal fraud standard as they do under the\n 3   Nevada state law fraud standard.    Accordingly, the Nordeens’\n 4   fraud claim was properly dismissed.\n 5   6) Perjury\n 6        The Nordeens allege that appellees committed perjury by\n 7   filing a proof of claim in the Nordeens’ bankruptcy case stating\n 8   that BAC is a secured creditor.    However, no civil claim for\n 9   perjury is recognized under Nevada law.    See, e.g., Jordan v.\n10   State ex rel. Dep’t of Motor Vehicles & Public Safety, 121 Nev.\n11   44, 68 n.51, 110 P.3d 30, 47 n.51 (Nev. 2005), overruled on other\n12   grounds, Buzz Stew, LLC v. City of N. Las Vegas, 124 Nev. 224,\n13   228 n.6, 181 P.3d 670, 672 n.6 (Nev. 2008).    Any alleged perjury\n14   committed in the filing of a claim in a bankruptcy case is\n15   subject to criminal sanctions under 18 U.S.C. § 152,9 not to any\n16   private right of action by the Nordeens.    Accordingly, the\n17\n18        9\n              18 U.S.C. § 152 provides in relevant part:\n19\n          A person who –\n20             . . .\n               (3) knowingly and fraudulently makes a false\n21             declaration, certificate, verification or\n22             statement under penalty of perjury as permitted\n               under section 1746 of title 28, in or in relation\n23             to any case under title 11;\n               (4) knowingly and fraudulently presents any\n24\n               false claim for proof against the estate of a\n25             debtor, or uses any such claim in any case\n               under title 11, in a personal capacity or as\n26             or through an agent, proxy, or attorney;\n27             . . .\n          shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more\n28        than 5 years, or both.\n\n                                     -27-\n\f 1   bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing the Nordeens’ perjury\n 2   claim.\n 3   7) UCC claims\n 4        The Nordeens’ Fifth Cause of Action is confusing to say the\n 5   least.   First, the claim is titled, “Federal Laws UCC-3 UCC-9.”\n 6   “UCC” refers to the Uniform Commercial Code, which is a model\n 7   uniform act designed to harmonize the laws of sales and certain\n 8   other commercial transactions among the fifty states.     It has\n 9   been adopted, with variations, by all of the states but has not\n10   been adopted as federal law by Congress.     See, e.g., Bank of Am.\n11   Nat’l Trust & Sav. Ass’n v. United States, 552 F.2d 302, 303 n.1\n12   (9th Cir. 1977); O’Neill v. United States, 50 F.3d 677, 684 (9th\n13   Cir. 1995) (“The Uniform Commercial Code is a source of federal\n14   common law and may be relied upon in interpreting a contract to\n15   which the federal government is a party.”     (Emphasis added.)).\n16        In their Fifth Cause of Action, the Nordeens complain about\n17   various alleged misrepresentations made by the appellees “through\n18   the U.S. Mails” and presentation of the Bogus Note to the\n19   Nordeens, all following the sale of the Note to CWALT.     See\n20   Second Amended Complaint, ¶ 167-70, p. 44.     In light of those\n21   allegations, the Nordeens ask that the bankruptcy court void the\n22   Note and Trust Deed and enjoin the appellees from ever attempting\n23   to foreclose on the Property.\n24        If the Nordeens’ “UCC” claim can be interpreted as a state\n25   law Uniform Commercial Code claim, Arizona law applies.     The\n26   Property is located in Arizona, and Arizona law applies to\n27   foreclosures on Arizona property.      See Vasquez v. Saxon Mortg.,\n28   Inc. (In re Vasquez), 228 Ariz. 357, 359-60, 266 P.3d 1053, 1055-\n\n                                     -28-\n\f 1   56 (Ariz. 2011) (en banc).   However, under Arizona law, the\n 2   Nordeens’ UCC claim fails as a matter of law.\n 3        As recently concluded by the Ninth Circuit:\n 4        The Arizona Supreme Court has definitively rejected the\n          Zadroznys’ argument that a trustee must comply with UCC\n 5        provisions to pursue foreclosure proceedings. In\n          Hogan, the Arizona Supreme Court explained that “[t]he\n 6        UCC does not govern liens on real property. The trust\n          deed statutes do not require compliance with the UCC\n 7        before a trustee commences a nonjudicial foreclosure.”\n          Hogan [v. Washington Mutual Bank, N.A.], 277 P.3d\n 8        [781,] 783 [(Ariz. 2012) (en banc), as amended]\n          (citations omitted).\n 9\n10   Zadrozny v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, __ F.3d __, 2013 WL 3242528, at\n11   *6 (9th Cir. June 28, 2013).\n12        To the extent that the Nordeens’ Fifth Cause of Action\n13   relies on their Securitization Theory, we reject it for the\n14   reasons previously stated.   To the extent that it reiterates\n15   their fraud and fabricated note claims, we likewise reject it for\n16   reasons previously stated.   We discern nothing more of substance\n17   in the Nordeens’ Fifth Cause of Action and conclude that the\n18   bankruptcy court properly dismissed it.\n19   8) RICO claims\n20        RICO makes it unlawful “for any person employed by or\n21   associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of\n22   which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\n23   participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\n24   enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity\n25   or collection of unlawful debt.”    18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).   To plead\n26   a claim for relief under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a plaintiff must\n27   assert “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern\n28   (4) of racketeering activity.”    Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,\n\n                                      -29-\n\f 1   473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985); Odom v. Microsoft Corp., 486 F.3d 541,\n 2   547 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc).\n 3        For purposes of this appeal, we focus on the two elements of\n 4   “a pattern” and “racketeering activity.”      A “pattern” “requires\n 5   at least two acts of racketeering activity.”      18 U.S.C.\n 6   § 1961(5).   “Racketeering activity” encompasses “any act\n 7   indictable under several provisions of Title 18 of the United\n 8   States Code, and includes the predicate acts of mail fraud, wire\n 9   fraud and obstruction of justice.”      Turner v. Cook, 362 F.3d\n10   1219, 1229 (9th Cir. 2004).   A claimant may seek civil relief for\n11   any RICO violation(s) resulting in injury to his or her business\n12   or property.   18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).\n13        To have standing under civil RICO, [a claimant] is\n          required to show that the racketeering activity was\n14        both a but-for cause and a proximate cause of his\n          injury. See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503\n15        U.S. 258, 268 . . . (1992). Proximate causation for\n          RICO purposes requires “some direct relation between\n16        the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.”\n          Id.\n17\n18   Rezner v. Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank AG, 630 F.3d 866, 873\n19   (9th Cir. 2010).   Chaset v. Fleer/Skybox Int’l, LP, 300 F.3d\n20   1083, 1086 (9th Cir. 2002) (“First, a civil RICO plaintiff must\n21   show that his injury was proximately caused by the [prohibited]\n22   conduct.   Second, the plaintiff must show that he has suffered a\n23   concrete financial loss.”), quoting Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v.\n24   Stites, 258 F.3d 1016, 1021 (9th Cir. 2001).\n25        The Nordeens’ Sixth Cause of Action, titled “Possible\n26   Collusion, RICO Act and Possible Counterfeiting,” falls far short\n27   of those standards.   First, the Nordeens allege in conclusory\n28   fashion that “collusion or racketeering acts may have occurred.”\n\n                                      -30-\n\f 1   (Emphasis added.)   Second, the Nordeens do not allege any\n 2   “concrete financial loss” to them or their property resulting\n 3   from what the appellees may have done.     The Nordeens embellish\n 4   their claim with further fulminations against the appellees in\n 5   light of their Securitization Theory.     In their Opening Brief,\n 6   the Nordeens’ argument in support of their RICO claim is that\n 7   “the [appellees] brought an active security into the court room\n 8   and proffered it as [the Nordeens’] original Note.     You cannot\n 9   use a security as a Note when it is an active security.”\n10   Appellants’ Opening Brief, at 29.      In short, the Nordeens do not\n11   state a civil RICO claim that is remotely plausible, and their\n12   Sixth Cause of Action was appropriately dismissed.\n13   9) Truth in Lending\n14        The purpose of TILA is “to assure a meaningful disclosure of\n15   credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more\n16   readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the\n17   uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against\n18   inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.”\n19   15 U.S.C. § 1601(a).   “Accordingly, [TILA] requires creditors to\n20   provide borrowers with clear and accurate disclosures of terms\n21   dealing with things like finance charges, annual percentage rates\n22   of interest, and the borrower’s rights.”     Beach v. Ocwen Fed.\n23   Bank, 523 U.S. 410, 412 (1998).\n24        While the Nordeens’ claims do not appear to fit the TILA\n25   model, they ultimately are precluded by applicable statutes of\n26   limitations.   The general limitations period that applies with\n27   respect to TILA claims is “one year from the date of the\n28   occurrence of the violation.”   15 U.S.C. § 1640(e).    The Nordeens\n\n                                     -31-\n\f 1   did not initiate their adversary proceeding against the appellees\n 2   until March 3, 2011.   The Nordeens signed the Note and Trust Deed\n 3   on October 21, 2005, more than five years earlier.    The sale of\n 4   the Note to CWALT occurred on October 30, 2005.    If the TILA\n 5   limitations period runs from October 2005, the one-year TILA\n 6   limitations period ran years ago.\n 7        There is authority for the proposition that the TILA statute\n 8   of limitations can be equitably tolled until the borrower has\n 9   actual notice of the claimed TILA violation.    See, e.g., King v.\n10   California, 784 F.2d 910, 914-15 (9th Cir. 1986).    However, the\n11   Nordeens did not assert equitable tolling of the TILA limitations\n12   period in the Second Amended Complaint, and in any event, the\n13   Nordeens assert that they learned of the alleged “TRUE SALE” of\n14   their Note and Trust Deed “on January 16, 2009 and even more\n15   clearly on September 8, 2009,” well over one year before they\n16   filed the Initial Complaint.   Their TILA claim was not filed\n17   within the general TILA one-year statute of limitations.\n18        To the extent that the Nordeens’ TILA claim could be\n19   interpreted as a claim for rescission, a longer period of\n20   limitations applies.   Under 15 U.S.C. § 1635(f), “An obligor’s\n21   right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of\n22   consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property,\n23   whichever occurs first, notwithstanding the fact that the\n24   information and forms required under this section or any other\n25   disclosures required under this part have not been delivered to\n26   the obligor . . . .”   The Supreme Court has held that “[15\n27   U.S.C.] § 1635(f) completely extinguishes the right of rescission\n28   at the end of the 3-year period.”     Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 523\n\n                                    -32-\n\f 1   U.S. at 412.\n 2        The Ninth Circuit has held that an obligor’s rescission\n 3   under TILA is conditioned on the obligor repaying any amounts\n 4   advanced by the lender.   See, e.g., Yamamoto v. Bank of N.Y., 329\n 5   F.3d 1167, 1171 (9th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1149\n 6   (2004); LaGrone v. Johnson, 534 F.2d 1360, 1362 (9th Cir. 1976).\n 7   The Nordeens do not offer to repay any outstanding balance of the\n 8   loan evidenced by the Note for purposes of implementing a\n 9   rescission anywhere in the Second Amended Complaint, but even if\n10   they did, the three-year limitations period to exercise a right\n11   of rescission under TILA ran in 2008, before the Nordeens ceased\n12   making Note payments and years before they filed the Initial\n13   Complaint.   The bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing the\n14   Nordeens’ TILA claim as barred by applicable statutes of\n15   limitations.\n16   10) RESPA\n17        RESPA was designed to change the settlement process for the\n18   financing of purchases of residential real estate, resulting\n19        (1) in more effective advance disclosure to home buyers\n          and sellers of settlement costs;\n20        (2) in the elimination of kickbacks or referral fees\n          that tend to increase unnecessarily the costs of\n21        certain settlement services;\n          (3) in a reduction in the amounts home buyers are\n22        required to place in escrow accounts established to\n          insure the payment of real estate taxes and insurance;\n23        and\n          (4) in significant reform and modernization of local\n24        recordkeeping of land title information.\n25   12 U.S.C. § 2601(b).\n26        RESPA requires loan servicers to provide borrowers with\n27   information concerning any transfers of loan servicing.    See 12\n28   U.S.C. § 2605(a)-(d).   RESPA further requires that loan servicers\n\n                                    -33-\n\f 1   respond to borrower inquiries requesting “information relating to\n 2   the servicing of such loan[s].”    12 U.S.C. § 2605(e)(1)(A).   Such\n 3   inquiries are submitted in the form of a “qualified written\n 4   request.”   A qualified written request must contain information\n 5   that will allow the loan servicer to identify the name and\n 6   account of the borrower and “includes a statement of the reasons\n 7   for the belief of the borrower . . . that the account is in error\n 8   or provides sufficient detail to the [loan] servicer regarding\n 9   other information sought by the borrower.”    12 U.S.C.\n10   § 2605(e)(1)(B).    Accordingly, RESPA concerns and encompasses\n11   issues with respect to costs and services related to the closing\n12   of home loans and loan servicer accounting for the borrower’s\n13   loan payments and escrow charges.\n14        Nothing in the Nordeens’ Seventh Cause of Action (covering\n15   their claims under RESPA, TILA and the FDCPA) alleges how either\n16   of the appellees purportedly violated any provision of RESPA.\n17   Reading the Second Amended Complaint very broadly, the bankruptcy\n18   court interpreted the Nordeens’ RESPA claim as a further\n19   iteration of their “challenge [to] the validity of their loan,”\n20   i.e., the Note and Trust Deed, rather than as complaining about\n21   the economics of the settlement or servicing arrangements for\n22   their loan.   We consider that interpretation as giving the\n23   Nordeens the benefit of a liberal interpretation of their Second\n24   Amended Complaint, and we see no error by the bankruptcy court in\n25   dismissing the Nordeens’ RESPA claim based on that\n26   interpretation.    See, e.g., Consumer Solutions REO, LLC v.\n27   Hillery, 658 F. Supp. 2d 1002, 1014 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (RESPA claim\n28   dismissed without leave to amend where the borrower disputed the\n\n                                     -34-\n\f 1   validity of the loan rather than any aspect of its servicing);\n 2   MorEquity, Inc. v. Naeem, 118 F. Supp. 2d 885, 900-01 (N.D. Ill.\n 3   2000).\n 4   11) FDCPA\n 5        Under the FDCPA, “A debt collector may not use any false,\n 6   deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection\n 7   with the collection of any debt.”      15 U.S.C. § 1692e (emphasis\n 8   added).   Under the FDCPA, the term “debt collector” generally is\n 9   defined as,\n10        any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate\n          commerce or the mails in any business the principal\n11        purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who\n          regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or\n12        indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or\n          due another.\n13\n14   15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).\n15        The bankruptcy court dismissed the Nordeens’ FDCPA claim\n16   because the appellees were not “debt collectors” subject to\n17   liability under the FDCPA for the following reasons: BAC is the\n18   servicer of the Nordeens’ loan, and as such, BAC is not subject\n19   to liability under the FDCPA.   As Trustee under the Trust Deed,\n20   ReconTrust likewise is not subject to liability under the FDCPA,\n21   as foreclosing on real property under a deed of trust is not an\n22   act to collect a debt, as contemplated under the FDCPA.      See\n23   Hulse v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB, 195 F. Supp. 2d 1188, 1204 (D. Or.\n24   2002) (“Foreclosing on a trust deed is distinct from the\n25   collection of the obligation to pay money” and is “not an attempt\n26   to collect funds from the debtor.”).\n27        The bankruptcy court’s decision is supported by the recent\n28   published opinion of the Ninth Circuit in Schlegel v. Wells Fargo\n\n                                     -35-\n\f 1   Bank, NA, ___ F.3d ___, 2013 WL 3336727 (9th Cir. July 3, 2013).\n 2   In Schlegel, the plaintiffs sued Wells Fargo Bank, NA (“Wells\n 3   Fargo”), the assignee of the promissory note and trust deed\n 4   secured by their residence property, for alleged violations of\n 5   the FDCPA and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”).    The\n 6   district court had dismissed both claims for failure to state a\n 7   claim upon which relief could be granted.   Id., at *1, *2.   The\n 8   Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s dismissal of the\n 9   Schlegels’ ECOA claim but affirmed the dismissal of the FDCPA\n10   claim because Wells Fargo did not fit the definition of a “debt\n11   collector” under the FDCPA.\n12        The complaint fails to provide any factual basis from\n          which we could plausibly infer that the principal\n13        purpose of Wells Fargo’s business is debt collection.\n          Rather, the complaint’s factual matter, viewed in the\n14        light most favorable to the Schlegels, establishes only\n          that debt collection is some part of Wells Fargo’s\n15        business, which is insufficient to state a claim under\n          the FDCPA. See Dougherty [v. City of Covina,] 654 F.3d\n16        [892,] 900-01 [(9th Cir. 2011)].\n17   Id., at *3 (emphasis added).\n18        Since the bankruptcy court’s decision to dismiss the\n19   Nordeens’ FDCPA claim is entirely consistent with the Ninth\n20   Circuit’s analysis and conclusion that the FDCPA claim in\n21   Schlegel was appropriately dismissed, we perceive no error.\n22   12) Dismissal without leave to amend\n23        In this case, the Nordeens had three bites at the apple\n24   before the bankruptcy court dismissed their Second Amended\n25   Complaint with prejudice.   The appellees filed a motion to\n26   dismiss the Initial Complaint, which the bankruptcy court\n27   granted.   However, at the July 26th Hearing on the motion to\n28   dismiss, the bankruptcy court listened carefully to the Nordeens’\n\n                                    -36-\n\f 1   arguments and took great pains to explain to them what claims in\n 2   their Initial Complaint were not viable and what claims might be\n 3   plausibly stated.   Then, in its order, the bankruptcy court\n 4   granted the Nordeens leave to file an amended complaint for\n 5   declaratory relief.   Thereafter, the Nordeens filed a motion to\n 6   reconsider the dismissal order and filed a First Amended\n 7   Complaint that reiterated extensively the same Securitization\n 8   Theory claims that the bankruptcy court had advised them at the\n 9   July 26th Hearing were not viable.     The bankruptcy court sorted\n10   through the issues between the parties at the September 13th\n11   Hearing, reiterating to the Nordeens that their Securitization\n12   Theory claims did not work but granting them leave to file a\n13   further amended complaint seeking declaratory relief and possibly\n14   asserting further claims.    In its order denying the Nordeens\n15   motion for reconsideration, the bankruptcy court expressly\n16   authorized the Nordeens to file a second amended complaint but\n17   warned that “no further leave to file additional amended\n18   complaints shall be granted.”    The Nordeens filed their Second\n19   Amended Complaint, again based primarily on their Securitization\n20   Theory claims.   The bankruptcy court ultimately dismissed the\n21   Second Amended Complaint with prejudice in response to the\n22   Pleadings Judgment Motion.\n23        The Ninth Circuit addressed the standards for dismissing a\n24   complaint without leave to amend in its recent published opinion\n25   in Zadrozny v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, __ F.3d __, 2013 WL 3242528,\n26   at *8 (9th Cir. June 28, 2013):\n27        Because the Zadroznys’ claims . . . are factually and\n          legally implausible, denial of leave to amend lay\n28        within the district court’s discretion. See Mirmehdi\n\n                                     -37-\n\f 1        v. United States, 689 F.3d 975, 985 (9th Cir. 2012)\n          (“[A] party is not entitled to an opportunity to amend\n 2        his complaint if any potential amendment would be\n          futile. . . .”), as amended (citation omitted). This\n 3        is particularly true as the Zadroznys had a prior\n          opportunity to amend their complaint. See Cafasso,\n 4        United States ex rel. v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc.,\n          637 F.3d 1047, 1058 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The district\n 5        court’s discretion to deny leave to amend is\n          particularly broad where plaintiff has previously\n 6        amended the complaint.”) (citation and alteration\n          omitted). (Emphasis added.)\n 7\n 8   Under this standard, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did\n 9   not err in dismissing the Nordeens’ Second Amended Complaint with\n10   prejudice.   It is our perception that the bankruptcy court bent\n11   over backwards at several substantive hearings concerning the\n12   Nordeens’ various complaints to explain to them what would work\n13   to state a plausible claim in a complaint that could be tried.\n14   Despite the bankruptcy court’s best efforts, the Nordeens\n15   insisted throughout on filing complaints that shed much heat but\n16   little light on their potential claims and ultimately did not\n17   state any plausible claims under applicable law and pleading\n18   standards in a federal court.   In light of the Nordeens’ failures\n19   to state a plausible claim for relief through three prolix\n20   efforts after receiving substantial guidance from the bankruptcy\n21   court, we agree with the bankruptcy court that giving them a\n22   further opportunity to amend their complaint would be futile.\n23   The Second Amended Complaint was properly dismissed without leave\n24   to amend.\n25                             VI.   CONCLUSION\n26        Based on the foregoing analysis of the issues raised in this\n27   appeal under applicable law, we AFFIRM.\n28\n\n                                     -38-\n\f",

Loan History\n18        On October 21, 2005, the Nordeens signed a promissory note\n19   for $140,000 (the “Note”), payable to Countrywide Home Loans,\n20   Inc. (“Countrywide”).    The Note provides that: “[The Nordeens]\n21   understand that [Countrywide] may transfer this Note.\n22   [Countrywide] or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who\n23   is entitled to receive payment under this Note is called the\n24   ‘Note Holder.’”\n25        To secure their payment obligations under the Note, on\n26\n27         2\n            BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP merged with Bank of America,\n28   N.A. in July 2011.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f 1   October 21, 2005, the Nordeens also signed a deed of trust (the\n 2   “Trust Deed”) against their rental property in Surprise, Arizona\n 3   (the “Property”).   ReconTrust is the trustee named in the Trust\n 4   Deed, under which the Nordeens “irrevocably grant[ed] and\n 5   convey[ed]” the Property “in trust, with power of sale.”    The\n 6   named Trust Deed beneficiary was Mortgage Electronic Registration\n 7   Systems, Inc. (“MERS”), which was identified as “acting solely as\n 8   a nominee for [Countrywide] and [Countrywide’s] successors and\n 9   assigns.”\n10        The Trust Deed expressly provides:\n11        Borrower [the Nordeens] understands and agrees that\n          MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by\n12        Borrower in this Security Instrument, but, if necessary\n          to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for\n13        Lender [Countrywide] and Lender’s successors and\n          assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those\n14        interests, including, but not limited to, releasing and\n          canceling this Security Instrument.\n15\n          The Trust Deed further provides:\n16\n          The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together\n17        with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more\n          times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might\n18        result in a change in the entity (known as the “Loan\n          Servicer”) that collects Periodic Payments due under\n19        the Note and this Security Instrument and performs\n          other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the\n20        Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law.\n          There also might be one or more changes of the Loan\n21        Servicer unrelated to a sale of the Note. If there is\n          a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given\n22        written notice of the change which will state the name\n          and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to\n23        which payments should be made and any other information\n          RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer\n24        of servicing. If the Note is sold and thereafter the\n          Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than the\n25        purchaser of the Note, the mortgage loan servicing\n          obligations to Borrower will remain with the Loan\n26        Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer\n          and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless\n27        otherwise provided by the Note purchaser.\n28        On October 30, 2005, the Note was sold to the CWALT 2005-\n\n                                     -3-\n\f 1   73CB REMIC Trust (“CWALT”).\n 2        In December 2008, the Nordeens were unable to make their\n 3   monthly Note payment, apparently as a result of defaulting\n 4   tenants leaving the Property in such bad shape that significant,\n 5   costly repairs were required.   The Nordeens contacted Countrywide\n 6   to see “if they could work anything out,” but Countrywide’s\n 7   representative “said they could do nothing.”    On January 16,\n 8   2009, BAC mailed the Nordeens a notice of intent to accelerate\n 9   the Nordeens’ payment obligations under the Note.    The Nordeens\n10   have not made a payment on the Note obligation since December\n11   2008.\n12        On March 23, 2009, ReconTrust initiated foreclosure\n13   proceedings with respect to the Property.     On May 29, 2009, the\n14   Nordeens sent what they characterized as a Qualified Written\n15   Request under RESPA3 to BAC and ReconTrust.\n16        ReconTrust initially responded to the Nordeens’ request for\n17   information.   In its response, ReconTrust apparently included\n18\n             3\n19          For purposes of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act\n     (“RESPA”), 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2617, a “qualified written request”\n20   consists of:\n21        [W]ritten correspondence, other than notice on a\n22        payment coupon or other payment medium supplied by the\n          [loan] servicer, that–\n23        (i) includes, or otherwise enables the servicer to\n          identify, the name and account of the borrower; and\n24\n          (ii) includes a statement of the reasons for the belief\n25        of the borrower, to the extent applicable, that the\n          account is in error or provides sufficient detail to\n26        the servicer regarding other information sought by the\n27        borrower.\n\n28   12 U.S.C. § 2605(e)(1)(B).\n\n                                     -4-\n\f 1   copies of the Note and Trust Deed and a payment history\n 2   corresponding to the Nordeens’ account.   ReconTrust also\n 3   explained that, despite the Nordeens’ apparent assertions to the\n 4   contrary, the Note and Trust Deed remained enforceable as\n 5   written.   Ultimately, in response to further communications from\n 6   the Nordeens over a number of months, BAC apparently advised the\n 7   Nordeens that payments on the Note were due and owing for\n 8   December 2008 through April 2010, and a foreclosure sale was\n 9   scheduled for May 18, 2010.   No foreclosure sale of the Property\n10   has occurred to date.\n11   B.   Bankruptcy Proceedings\n12        On June 28, 2009, the Nordeens filed for protection under\n13   chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.4   On August 7, 2009, BAC filed\n14   a proof of secured claim in the Nordeens’ bankruptcy case.\n15        On March 3, 2011, the Nordeens, acting pro se, filed an\n16   adversary proceeding complaint (“Initial Complaint”) against the\n17   appellees.   In the Initial Complaint, the Nordeens asserted\n18   claims for declaratory relief, fraud, quiet title, and violations\n19   of RESPA, the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-\n20   1667f, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), 15\n21   U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692p.   A prominent feature of the Initial\n22   Complaint was the Nordeens’ theory (the “Securitization Theory”)\n23   that the securitization of the Note and sale to CWALT constituted\n24\n25\n           4\n            Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n26   references are to the federal Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-\n27   1532, and all “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of\n     Bankruptcy Procedure, Rules 1001-9037. The Federal Rules of\n28   Civil Procedure are referred to as “Civil Rules.”\n\n                                     -5-\n\f 1   a “true sale” of the Note that vitiated its effectiveness as to\n 2   them and rendered the Trust Deed unenforceable as to the\n 3   Property.   The Nordeens also argued that the appellees had\n 4   somehow fabricated the version of the Note that they were trying\n 5   to enforce against the Nordeens.\n 6        On June 6, 2011, the appellees moved to dismiss the Initial\n 7   Complaint with prejudice under Civil Rule 12(b)(6).    After a\n 8   hearing on the motion on July 26, 2011 (“July 26th Hearing”), the\n 9   bankruptcy court granted the motion to dismiss in part but\n10   granted the Nordeens leave to amend their complaint.    At the\n11   July 26th Hearing, after hearing argument from the parties, the\n12   bankruptcy court rejected the Nordeens’ Securitization Theory but\n13   granted the Nordeens leave to amend their claim for declaratory\n14   relief “so you can sort out who’s got what note.”   The Nordeens’\n15   other claims were dismissed without leave to amend.    On August 8,\n16   2011, the bankruptcy court entered its order on the appellees’\n17   motion to dismiss the Initial Complaint, providing that\n18   “Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED; IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the\n19   Plaintiffs shall have leave until August 26, 2011 to file an\n20   amended complaint to assert a declaratory relief action; . . . .”\n21        On August 8, 2011, the Nordeens moved for reconsideration of\n22   the bankruptcy court’s order on appellees’ motion to dismiss and\n23   filed a “disapproval to order on motion to dismiss that attorneys\n24   have done for the court.”   The Nordeens further filed a first\n25   amended complaint (“First Amended Complaint”) on August 26, 2011.\n26        The bankruptcy court held a hearing on September 13, 2011\n27   (“September 13th Hearing”), to consider outstanding issues\n28   between the parties, including the Nordeens’ motion for\n\n                                     -6-\n\f 1   reconsideration of the prior dismissal order.       At the September\n 2   13th Hearing, the bankruptcy court reiterated to the Nordeens\n 3   that claims based on their Securitization Theory were not viable.\n 4   They could replead a more limited declaratory relief claim based\n 5   upon their allegations that the appellees were trying to collect\n 6   on the wrong Note.       However, if the Nordeens wanted to assert\n 7   additional claims for relief, they would need to file a motion to\n 8   amend their complaint.       But, the bankruptcy court cautioned, “You\n 9   [the Nordeens] can’t bring back the causes of action I’ve already\n10   dismissed.”       Ultimately, the bankruptcy court granted the\n11   Nordeens leave to file a second amended complaint.\n12        The bankruptcy court entered an order denying the Nordeens’\n13   motion for reconsideration of the order on appellees’ original\n14   motion to dismiss (the “Reconsideration Order”) on September 21,\n15   2011.       In the Reconsideration Order, the bankruptcy court granted\n16   the Nordeens until October 11, 2011 to file their second amended\n17   complaint but further ordered that “no further leave to file\n18   additional amended complaints shall be granted.”\n19        On October 11, 2011, the Nordeens filed their second amended\n20   complaint (“Second Amended Complaint”).       In the Second Amended\n21   Complaint, the Nordeens again focused on their Securitization\n22   Theory, asserting claims under that umbrella for declaratory\n23   relief, fraud, perjury, “material facts as to contracts,\n24   securities, and as to pleading, and practice,” “federal laws UCC-\n25   3 [and] UCC-9,” “possible collusion, RICO Act5 and possible\n26\n27           5\n            The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n28   (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968.\n\n                                         -7-\n\f 1   counterfeiting,” and “housing laws.”\n 2        The appellees filed an answer to the Second Amended\n 3   Complaint on November 8, 2011.      Following substantial discovery,\n 4   on May 8, 2012, the appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings\n 5   (“Pleadings Judgment Motion”) under Civil Rule 12(c).        The\n 6   Nordeens filed an opposition to the Pleadings Judgment Motion on\n 7   May 29, 2012, to which the appellees replied on June 5, 2012.\n 8        The bankruptcy court heard the Pleadings Judgment Motion on\n 9   June 12, 2012 (“June 12th Hearing”).      At the June 12th Hearing,\n10   after hearing argument from the parties, the bankruptcy court\n11   took the Pleadings Judgment Motion under advisement.        On\n12   August 10, 2012, the bankruptcy court issued its Memorandum\n13   Decision.   On the same date, for the reasons stated in the\n14   Memorandum Decision, the bankruptcy court entered an order\n15   dismissing the Second Amended Complaint with prejudice.          The\n16   Nordeens filed a timely Notice of Appeal on August 23, 2012.\n17                               II.   JURISDICTION\n18        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n19   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(B), (K) and (O).        We have\n20   jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 158.\n21                        III.

Where the defense of failure to state a claim upon\n26   which relief can be granted is raised in a Civil Rule 12(c)\n27   motion, the legal test applied is the same as if the defense had\n28   been raised earlier in a motion to dismiss under Civil Rule\n\n                                      -10-\n\f 1   12(b)(6).

Yet,\n 3   nowhere in their Opening Brief do the Nordeens cite one example\n 4   of where the bankruptcy court erred in so characterizing their\n 5   factual allegations as legal conclusions.    We perceive no such\n 6   error in the bankruptcy court’s consideration of the Nordeens’\n 7   factual allegations in its analysis set forth in the Memorandum\n 8   Decision.\n 9\n     2) Timing of the bankruptcy court’s consideration of the\n10   Pleadings Judgment Motion\n11        Although their argument as to the timing of the bankruptcy\n12   court’s consideration of the Pleadings Judgment Motion is less\n13   than clear (see Appellants’ Opening Brief, at 1 and 11-12), the\n14   Nordeens appear to argue that the bankruptcy court erred in\n15   considering the Pleadings Judgment Motion after 1) all of the\n16   pleadings had been settled, 2) the parties had agreed on a\n17   scheduling plan and had engaged in substantial discovery, and 3)\n18   September 24, 2012 had been set as the trial date.    In essence,\n19   the argument is, after all that had been accomplished in the\n20   adversary proceeding, the bankruptcy court should have tried it\n21   rather than dismissing it in response to the Pleadings Judgment\n22   Motion.\n23        Civil Rule 12(c) provides that, “After the pleadings are\n24   closed–but early enough not to delay trial–a party may move for\n25   judgment on the pleadings.”    (Emphasis added.)   We emphasize that\n26   under Civil Rule 12(c), it was not for the bankruptcy court to\n27   raise the issue of the appropriateness of granting judgment on\n28   the pleadings sua sponte.    Under the rule, the bankruptcy court\n\n                                     -13-\n\f 1   could not consider such a motion until brought by an interested\n 2   party, in this case, the appellees.    The bankruptcy court did not\n 3   consider the Pleadings Judgment Motion until after it was filed,\n 4   the Nordeens had an opportunity to respond, and the bankruptcy\n 5   court heard argument at the June 12th Hearing.    The bankruptcy\n 6   court’s decision to grant the Pleadings Judgment Motion with\n 7   prejudice did not “delay” the trial.    Rather it avoided a trial\n 8   that the bankruptcy court determined was unwarranted because the\n 9   Nordeens had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\n10   granted.   Based on this record, we conclude that the bankruptcy\n11   court did not err in acting consistently with the provisions of\n12   Civil Rule 12(c).\n13\n     3) The bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting the Nordeens’\n14   Securitization Theory.\n15        As early as the July 26th Hearing, the bankruptcy court\n16   advised the Nordeens that their Securitization Theory was not\n17   viable and dismissed the Nordeens’ claims based on the\n18   Securitization Theory.    Yet, in every iteration of their\n19   complaint filed since then, including the Second Amended\n20   Complaint that the bankruptcy court ultimately dismissed with\n21   prejudice, the Nordeens have extensively repeated their\n22   Securitization Theory allegations in the service of their\n23   ultimate objectives: “[The Nordeens] want to restraint [sic] all\n24   parties from ever going after [the Nordeens] again and to declare\n25   this contract [the Note and the Trust Deed] void.”    Appellants’\n26   Opening Brief, at 10.    “[The Nordeens] want to prevent all\n27   parties from ever attempting to foreclose on us again.”\n28   Appellants’ Opening Brief, at 30.\n\n                                     -14-\n\f 1        The bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting and in\n 2   dismissing the Nordeens’ claims based on their Securitization\n 3   Theory, and its rulings are consistent with repeated\n 4   determinations of the district courts sitting in Nevada and\n 5   Arizona and elsewhere in the Ninth Circuit.

Now, when\n27   a vast market has been established for mortgage-backed\n28   securities, that view seems quaint.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f 1        However, home loan borrowers are not purchasing an\n 2   investment when they enter into a loan agreement to purchase or\n 3   refinance a home.   When they sign a promissory note and mortgage\n 4   or trust deed secured by their real property, they are entering\n 5   into a contract for a loan transaction on fixed terms, and any\n 6   “upside” or investment incentive to enter into the transaction is\n 7   based on a prospective increase in the value of the subject real\n 8   property.   Accordingly, the borrower’s loan contract (the Note\n 9   and Trust Deed in this appeal) is distinct and separate from any\n10   securities transaction in the “secondary market” encompassing\n11   assignment of the contract.   The Note in this case documents this\n12   distinction in its provisions that, “[The Nordeens] understand\n13   that [Countrywide] may transfer this Note.   [Countrywide] or\n14   anyone else who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled\n15   to receive payments under this Note is called the ‘Note Holder.’”\n16   Likewise, the Trust Deed provides that, “The Note or a partial\n17   interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can\n18   be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower.”\n19   (Emphasis added.)   This distinction between the “loan” contract\n20   and the “securitization” contract has been recognized by the\n21   courts that have rejected the Securitization Theory.   See, e.g.,\n22   Reyes v.

Md. 2010) (court\n 3        rejected plaintiff’s argument that he did not consent\n          to securitization because the note contained such\n 4        consent). (Emphasis added.)\n 5        As long as a borrower in such circumstances makes all of the\n 6   scheduled promissory note payments to a loan servicer, the\n 7   contract functions seamlessly (at least theoretically), and the\n 8   borrower may never know (or have any reason to know) who ends up\n 9   owning the note.   The problem arises, as in this case, when a\n10   borrower faces difficulties making loan payments and needs to\n11   enter into constructive negotiations with the lender to\n12   restructure the loan to make it work for both parties.    As the\n13   Nordeens discovered, to their increasing frustration and anguish\n14   over time, it is difficult to make contact with decision makers\n15   for a securitized loan, and the reaction of loan servicer\n16   representatives in our experience often has been exactly the\n17   response the Nordeens received to their pleas: “We can do\n18   nothing.”   Foreclosure ensues.\n19        Various attempts to amend the Bankruptcy Code to give\n20   bankruptcy courts the authority to modify mortgage or trust deed\n21   secured loans to reflect the reality of declining real property\n22   values have been made, without success to date.   That leaves\n23   parties, like the Nordeens, in the situation where they often\n24   have no legal remedy to the perceived ills and unfairness\n25   resulting from the securitization of their Note and Trust Deed.\n26   While we are sympathetic to the Nordeens’ plight, we agree with\n27   the bankruptcy court that claims based on the Nordeens’\n28   Securitization Theory are not viable in this case.   As bankruptcy\n\n                                       -18-\n\f 1   courts, unfortunately, we have no general authority to require\n 2   lenders or loan servicers to behave reasonably.\n 3        Contrary to the Nordeens’ assertion that the bankruptcy\n 4   court violated their rights to due process by not allowing them\n 5   to present securitization-based claims (see Appellants’ Opening\n 6   Brief, at 2, 22-23), the bankruptcy court properly dismissed\n 7   their Securitization Theory arguments that did not assert a\n 8   legally cognizable claim.   The bankruptcy court clearly told the\n 9   Nordeens at an early stage in the proceedings that their\n10   Securitization Theory claims were not viable and dismissed them,\n11   but the Nordeens kept pleading them anyway.\n12\n     4) The Nordeens’ further claims for declaratory relief based on\n13   alleged fabrications of the Note are not viable.\n14        At the July 26th Hearing and the September 13th Hearing, the\n15   bankruptcy court considered and allowed the Nordeens to amend and\n16   restate their claim for declaratory relief based on their\n17   expressed concerns as to whom they owed an obligation to pay and\n18   issues as to alleged fabrication of the Note.   As noted by the\n19   bankruptcy court in the Memorandum Decision, at p. 8:\n20        Declaratory relief is appropriate “(1) when the\n          judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and\n21        settling the legal relations in issue, and (2) when it\n          will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty,\n22        insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the\n          proceeding.” McGraw-Edison Co. v.

Aside\n\n                                    -19-\n\f 1   from questions relating to who is entitled to enforce the Trust\n 2   Deed obligations, discussed infra, the Nordeens rely on\n 3   allegations that the appellees have produced a “false and\n 4   fabricated” Note.   Helpfully, the Nordeens attached as Exhibit O\n 5   to the Second Amended Complaint a “Certified Copy of the Note\n 6   that [the Nordeens] closed with [and signed] on October 21, 2005\n 7   and took . . . home with them” (the “Genuine Note”), and as\n 8   Exhibit P to the Second Amended Complaint “the fabricated copy of\n 9   [the Nordeens’] Note that has been presented in this court as the\n10   ‘original’ and as a ‘copy’” (the “Bogus Note”).\n11        The differences between the Genuine Note and the Bogus Note\n12   are detailed by the Nordeens as follows: 1) In the upper left\n13   hand corner of the first page of the Genuine Note, it states\n14   “Prepared by MARGARITA RUIZ;” the Bogus Note states “Prepared by\n15   REMEDIOS BROWN.”    2) The Nordeens assert that their initials are\n16   “different” and in different places on the two note exhibits.\n17   3) The “supposed signatures” on the Bogus Note “are not the\n18   same.”   4) The color of ink on the Bogus Note, presented as the\n19   original Note at the July 26th Hearing, is a “strange light\n20   blue.”   5) There are orange highlighter marks under the\n21   signatures and initials on the Bogus Note.   6) The\n22   “Certification” on the Bogus Note is allegedly different from the\n23   “Certification” on the Genuine Note, as appearing to be “in a\n24   different place and appear[ing] to be signed by a different\n25   person.”   (Actually, the only “certification” on Exhibit O that\n26   we see is the “true copy” certification on page one of Exhibit O.\n27   No such certification appears on Exhibit P.)   7) Finally,\n28   “[t]here are other variations with completely different barcodes\n\n                                     -20-\n\f 1   and redactions and punch holes that could indicate multiple\n 2   pledges or sales of this mis-represented [sic] fabricated Note\n 3   but none that are the [Nordeens’] Certified copy from closing.”\n 4   Second Amended Complaint, ¶ 96-97, pp. 26-28; Exhibits O and P.\n 5        Conspicuously absent from the Nordeens’ allegations in the\n 6   Second Amended Complaint is any allegation that the terms of the\n 7   Genuine Note and the Bogus Note are different in any respect.      In\n 8   addition, although the Nordeens cannot quite bring themselves to\n 9   state that they signed the Note in their description of the\n10   Genuine Note, they admitted earlier in the Second Amended\n11   Complaint that they signed the Note.    See Second Amended\n12   Complaint, ¶ 15, p. 6.   The Nordeens further do not deny that the\n13   initials and the signatures on the Genuine Note are theirs.    At\n14   the July 26th Hearing, counsel for the appellees addressed the\n15   differences between copies of the Note as follows:\n16        From what I can tell from looking at those notes, the\n          major differentiations were things that happen when you\n17        copy notes that have been highlighted, when you copy\n          notes where redactions have taken place, when notes get\n18        copied and placed in binders, and hole punches get put\n          through the notes.\n19             I was hoping to put all of that to rest by\n          bringing the original note with me today, and . . . .\n20\n21   July 26th, 2011 Hr’g Tr., at 29:7-13.\n22        However, whatever explanation applies with respect to the\n23   alleged discrepancies between the Genuine Note and the Bogus Note\n24   noted by the Nordeens is beside the point in this appeal.    What\n25   is important is the substance of the alleged differences, and as\n26   a bottom line matter, the Nordeens’ allegations about different\n27   Notes make no substantive difference.

The Court finds this argument to be\n 6   meritless.”).\n 7        Section 3-309 of the Uniform Commercial Code provides for\n 8   enforcement of “lost, destroyed or stolen” promissory notes by a\n 9   person not in possession of the original promissory note when the\n10   subject person was entitled to enforce the note when the loss\n11   occurred, and the terms of the note can be proved.

A person not in possession of an instrument is\n16\n          entitled to enforce the instrument if:\n17        (a) The person seeking to enforce the instrument:\n                (1) Was entitled to enforce the instrument when\n18        loss of possession occurred; or\n19              (2) Has directly or indirectly acquired ownership\n          of the instrument from a person who was entitled to\n20        enforce the instrument when loss of possession\n          occurred;\n21        . . .\n22        2. A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under\n          subsection 1 must prove the terms of the instrument and\n23        his or her right to enforce the instrument. If that\n          proof is made, NRS 104.3308 applies to the case as if\n24\n          the person seeking enforcement had produced the\n25        instrument. . . .\n26        Arizona law does not apply with respect to the Nordeens’\n27   declaratory relief claim based on the appellees’ alleged\n     fabrication of the Note.

As to the right to enforce, the Nordeens’\n 5   allegations in that regard arise from their Securitization Theory\n 6   that we previously have determined to be nonviable.      The Nordeens\n 7   do not challenge the form of the endorsement in blank on the\n 8   alleged Bogus Note.      While the Note was transferred at an early\n 9   stage from Countrywide to CWALT, the record reflects that the\n10   Nordeens have always dealt with BAC, formerly known as\n11   Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP, as their loan servicer, and\n12   ReconTrust has always served as the named trustee in the Trust\n13   Deed.       In their opening brief, the Nordeens concede that BAC has\n14   operated as their loan servicer.      Appellants’ Opening Brief, at\n15   16.\n16         The bankruptcy court raised a red herring when it gave as\n17   one of the bases for its dismissal of the declaratory judgment\n18   claim “the absence of any allegation [by the Nordeens] that they\n19   have placed funds into a segregated account in anticipation of\n20   the day when the proper payee is revealed,” but it did not err in\n21   concluding that the motivation of the Nordeens was to invalidate\n22   the Note so that any obligations reflected in the terms of the\n23   Note are unenforceable.      See Memorandum Decision, at pp. 8-9.\n24\n25\n             7\n           (...continued)\n26   Arizona Uniform Commercial Code law with respect to enforcement\n27   of “lost, destroyed or stolen” instruments is essentially the\n     same as Nevada’s.

First, the Nordeens allege in conclusory\n28   fashion that “collusion or racketeering acts may have occurred.”\n\n                                      -30-\n\f 1   (Emphasis added.)   Second, the Nordeens do not allege any\n 2   “concrete financial loss” to them or their property resulting\n 3   from what the appellees may have done.     The Nordeens embellish\n 4   their claim with further fulminations against the appellees in\n 5   light of their Securitization Theory.     In their Opening Brief,\n 6   the Nordeens’ argument in support of their RICO claim is that\n 7   “the [appellees] brought an active security into the court room\n 8   and proffered it as [the Nordeens’] original Note.     You cannot\n 9   use a security as a Note when it is an active security.”\n10   Appellants’ Opening Brief, at 29.      In short, the Nordeens do not\n11   state a civil RICO claim that is remotely plausible, and their\n12   Sixth Cause of Action was appropriately dismissed.\n13   9) Truth in Lending\n14        The purpose of TILA is “to assure a meaningful disclosure of\n15   credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more\n16   readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the\n17   uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against\n18   inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.”\n19   15 U.S.C. § 1601(a).   “Accordingly, [TILA] requires creditors to\n20   provide borrowers with clear and accurate disclosures of terms\n21   dealing with things like finance charges, annual percentage rates\n22   of interest, and the borrower’s rights.”     Beach v.

The general limitations period that applies with\n27   respect to TILA claims is “one year from the date of the\n28   occurrence of the violation.”   15 U.S.C. § 1640(e).    The Nordeens\n\n                                     -31-\n\f 1   did not initiate their adversary proceeding against the appellees\n 2   until March 3, 2011.   The Nordeens signed the Note and Trust Deed\n 3   on October 21, 2005, more than five years earlier.    The sale of\n 4   the Note to CWALT occurred on October 30, 2005.    If the TILA\n 5   limitations period runs from October 2005, the one-year TILA\n 6   limitations period ran years ago.\n 7        There is authority for the proposition that the TILA statute\n 8   of limitations can be equitably tolled until the borrower has\n 9   actual notice of the claimed TILA violation.

However, the\n11   Nordeens did not assert equitable tolling of the TILA limitations\n12   period in the Second Amended Complaint, and in any event, the\n13   Nordeens assert that they learned of the alleged “TRUE SALE” of\n14   their Note and Trust Deed “on January 16, 2009 and even more\n15   clearly on September 8, 2009,” well over one year before they\n16   filed the Initial Complaint.   Their TILA claim was not filed\n17   within the general TILA one-year statute of limitations.\n18        To the extent that the Nordeens’ TILA claim could be\n19   interpreted as a claim for rescission, a longer period of\n20   limitations applies.   Under 15 U.S.C. § 1635(f), “An obligor’s\n21   right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of\n22   consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property,\n23   whichever occurs first, notwithstanding the fact that the\n24   information and forms required under this section or any other\n25   disclosures required under this part have not been delivered to\n26   the obligor . . . .”   The Supreme Court has held that “[15\n27   U.S.C.] § 1635(f) completely extinguishes the right of rescission\n28   at the end of the 3-year period.”     Beach v.

The bankruptcy court did not err in dismissing the\n14   Nordeens’ TILA claim as barred by applicable statutes of\n15   limitations.\n16   10) RESPA\n17        RESPA was designed to change the settlement process for the\n18   financing of purchases of residential real estate, resulting\n19        (1) in more effective advance disclosure to home buyers\n          and sellers of settlement costs;\n20        (2) in the elimination of kickbacks or referral fees\n          that tend to increase unnecessarily the costs of\n21        certain settlement services;\n          (3) in a reduction in the amounts home buyers are\n22        required to place in escrow accounts established to\n          insure the payment of real estate taxes and insurance;\n23        and\n          (4) in significant reform and modernization of local\n24        recordkeeping of land title information.\n25   12 U.S.C. § 2601(b).\n26        RESPA requires loan servicers to provide borrowers with\n27   information concerning any transfers of loan servicing.    See 12\n28   U.S.C. § 2605(a)-(d).   RESPA further requires that loan servicers\n\n                                    -33-\n\f 1   respond to borrower inquiries requesting “information relating to\n 2   the servicing of such loan[s].”    12 U.S.C. § 2605(e)(1)(A).   Such\n 3   inquiries are submitted in the form of a “qualified written\n 4   request.”   A qualified written request must contain information\n 5   that will allow the loan servicer to identify the name and\n 6   account of the borrower and “includes a statement of the reasons\n 7   for the belief of the borrower . . . that the account is in error\n 8   or provides sufficient detail to the [loan] servicer regarding\n 9   other information sought by the borrower.”    12 U.S.C.\n10   § 2605(e)(1)(B).    Accordingly, RESPA concerns and encompasses\n11   issues with respect to costs and services related to the closing\n12   of home loans and loan servicer accounting for the borrower’s\n13   loan payments and escrow charges.\n14        Nothing in the Nordeens’ Seventh Cause of Action (covering\n15   their claims under RESPA, TILA and the FDCPA) alleges how either\n16   of the appellees purportedly violated any provision of RESPA.\n17   Reading the Second Amended Complaint very broadly, the bankruptcy\n18   court interpreted the Nordeens’ RESPA claim as a further\n19   iteration of their “challenge [to] the validity of their loan,”\n20   i.e., the Note and Trust Deed, rather than as complaining about\n21   the economics of the settlement or servicing arrangements for\n22   their loan.   We consider that interpretation as giving the\n23   Nordeens the benefit of a liberal interpretation of their Second\n24   Amended Complaint, and we see no error by the bankruptcy court in\n25   dismissing the Nordeens’ RESPA claim based on that\n26   interpretation.

Under the FDCPA, the term “debt collector” generally is\n 9   defined as,\n10        any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate\n          commerce or the mails in any business the principal\n11        purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who\n          regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or\n12        indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or\n          due another.\n13\n14   15 U.S.C. § 1692a(6).\n15        The bankruptcy court dismissed the Nordeens’ FDCPA claim\n16   because the appellees were not “debt collectors” subject to\n17   liability under the FDCPA for the following reasons: BAC is the\n18   servicer of the Nordeens’ loan, and as such, BAC is not subject\n19   to liability under the FDCPA.   As Trustee under the Trust Deed,\n20   ReconTrust likewise is not subject to liability under the FDCPA,\n21   as foreclosing on real property under a deed of trust is not an\n22   act to collect a debt, as contemplated under the FDCPA.

The appellees filed a motion to\n26   dismiss the Initial Complaint, which the bankruptcy court\n27   granted.   However, at the July 26th Hearing on the motion to\n28   dismiss, the bankruptcy court listened carefully to the Nordeens’\n\n                                    -36-\n\f 1   arguments and took great pains to explain to them what claims in\n 2   their Initial Complaint were not viable and what claims might be\n 3   plausibly stated.   Then, in its order, the bankruptcy court\n 4   granted the Nordeens leave to file an amended complaint for\n 5   declaratory relief.   Thereafter, the Nordeens filed a motion to\n 6   reconsider the dismissal order and filed a First Amended\n 7   Complaint that reiterated extensively the same Securitization\n 8   Theory claims that the bankruptcy court had advised them at the\n 9   July 26th Hearing were not viable.     The bankruptcy court sorted\n10   through the issues between the parties at the September 13th\n11   Hearing, reiterating to the Nordeens that their Securitization\n12   Theory claims did not work but granting them leave to file a\n13   further amended complaint seeking declaratory relief and possibly\n14   asserting further claims.    In its order denying the Nordeens\n15   motion for reconsideration, the bankruptcy court expressly\n16   authorized the Nordeens to file a second amended complaint but\n17   warned that “no further leave to file additional amended\n18   complaints shall be granted.”    The Nordeens filed their Second\n19   Amended Complaint, again based primarily on their Securitization\n20   Theory claims.   The bankruptcy court ultimately dismissed the\n21   Second Amended Complaint with prejudice in response to the\n22   Pleadings Judgment Motion.\n23        The Ninth Circuit addressed the standards for dismissing a\n24   complaint without leave to amend in its recent published opinion\n25   in Zadrozny v.

It is our perception that the bankruptcy court bent\n11   over backwards at several substantive hearings concerning the\n12   Nordeens’ various complaints to explain to them what would work\n13   to state a plausible claim in a complaint that could be tried.\n14   Despite the bankruptcy court’s best efforts, the Nordeens\n15   insisted throughout on filing complaints that shed much heat but\n16   little light on their potential claims and ultimately did not\n17   state any plausible claims under applicable law and pleading\n18   standards in a federal court.   In light of the Nordeens’ failures\n19   to state a plausible claim for relief through three prolix\n20   efforts after receiving substantial guidance from the bankruptcy\n21   court, we agree with the bankruptcy court that giving them a\n22   further opportunity to amend their complaint would be futile.\n23   The Second Amended Complaint was properly dismissed without leave\n24   to amend.\n25                             VI.   CONCLUSION\n26        Based on the foregoing analysis of the issues raised in this\n27   appeal under applicable law, we AFFIRM.\n28\n\n                                     -38-\n\f</pre>",
