Smith, Bankruptcy Judge, Presiding\n 3\n 4   Appearances:     Richard Edwin Masson, Esq. of Masson & Fatin, LLP\n                      argued for Dolores Stout and Kaufman Group, Inc.,\n 5                    appellants in 13-1045; John Robert Armstrong, II,\n                      Esq. of Horwitz Cron & Armstrong LLP argued for\n 6                    Richard A. Marshack, Chapter 7 Trustee, appellee\n                      in 13-1045 and for James Kerchner and Steven Root,\n 7                    appellees in 13-1045 and appellants in 13-1257;\n                      Michael S. Winsten, Esq. of Winsten Law Group\n 8                    argued for Edward J. Stout, appellee in 13-1257.\n 9\n10   Before: DUNN, KIRSCHER and TAYLOR, Bankruptcy Judges.\n11\n12        We consider two related appeals arising out of the same set\n13   of facts involving the debtor, Edward Stout, his mother, Dolores\n14   Stout (“Dolores”), and her company, Kaufman Group, Inc. (“Kaufman\n15   Group”), and three of the debtor’s creditors, Jim Kerchner\n16   (“Kerchner”), Steve Root (“Root”) and Qualtech Backplanes, Inc.\n17   (“Qualtech”)(collectively, “Creditors”).\n18        The two appeals concern transfers of assets by the debtor to\n19   Dolores.    One of the appeals (BAP No. CC-13-1045) involves an\n20   adversary proceeding (AP No. 11-1026) initiated by the chapter 72\n21   trustee (“Trustee”) and Creditors (who joined as co-plaintiffs)\n22   against Dolores and Kaufman Group (together, “Dolores”) under\n23   §§ 547(b), 548(a) and 550 (“Preference Adversary”).    Trustee and\n24\n25\n          2\n            Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n26   references are to the federal Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.\n27   §§ 101-1532, and all “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules\n     of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rules 1001-9037. The Federal Rules of\n28   Civil Procedure are referred to as “Civil Rules.”\n\n                                       2\n\f 1   Creditors later moved for partial summary judgment on their\n 2   §§ 547(b) and 548(a)(1) claims against Dolores and Kaufman Group.\n 3   The bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment in favor of\n 4   Trustee and Creditors on their § 547(b) claim (“§ 547(b) partial\n 5   summary judgment order”).   Dolores appeals the bankruptcy court’s\n 6   grant of partial summary judgment.\n 7        The second appeal (BAP No. CC-13-1257) involves an adversary\n 8   proceeding (AP No. 09-1669) initiated by Creditors against the\n 9   debtor seeking to except their debt from discharge under\n10   § 523(a)(6) and to deny the debtor’s discharge under\n11   § 727(a)(2)(A)(“Discharge Adversary”).   There, the bankruptcy\n12   court ultimately ruled in the debtor’s favor on both claims.\n13   Creditors subsequently moved to set aside the findings or for a\n14   new trial (“motion for new trial”) under Civil Rules 52(a) and\n15   59(a)3 and Rules 9013-4(a)(2), (7) and (8) of the Local\n16   Bankruptcy Rules for the Central District of California.4    The\n17   bankruptcy court denied the motion for new trial (“new trial\n18   order”); the Creditors now appeal.   Creditors moreover appeal the\n19   bankruptcy court’s judgment in the debtor’s favor on their\n20   § 727(a)(2)(A) claim (“§ 727(a)(2)(A) judgment”).\n21        For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the § 547(b)\n22   partial summary judgment order, the new trial order to the extent\n23\n24        3\n            Civil Rule 52 is made applicable through Rule 7052.    Civil\n25   Rule 59 is made applicable through Rule 9023.\n26        4\n            Creditors did not specify in their motion for new trial\n27   the subsections of Civil Rules 52(a) and 59(a) that apply. Based\n     on our review of the record and briefs before us, we assume that\n28   Creditors intended Civil Rules 52(a)(6) and 59(a)(1)(B) to apply.\n\n                                      3\n\f 1   it dealt with Creditors’ § 523(a)(6) claim, and the\n 2   § 727(a)(2)(A) judgment.\n 3\n 4                                  FACTS\n 5   A.   Events prior to the debtor’s chapter 7 bankruptcy\n 6        Prepetition, the debtor wholly owned and operated Dynamic\n 7   Stamping, Inc. (“Dynamic”), Electronic Connector Service, Inc.\n 8   (“Electronic”), and Qualtech Applied Engineering Corp.\n 9   (“Applied”)(collectively, “businesses”).5   Dynamic, Electronic\n10   and Applied designed, made and/or assembled specialized\n11   electronic components.\n12        Kerchner and Root owned and operated Qualtech, a company\n13   that made and sold various electronic connectors.   It leased from\n14   Lapco Industrial Parks (“landlord”) its manufacturing and office\n15   facilities (“facility”) located in Santa Ana, California.\n16        On September 18, 2006, the debtor and Creditors entered into\n17   an asset purchase agreement (“Asset Purchase Agreement”) whereby\n18   Creditors sold Qualtech’s business to the debtor (“Qualtech\n19   sale”).   Specifically, under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the\n20   debtor purchased substantially all of Qualtech’s assets\n21   (“Qualtech Assets”)6 for $250,000 cash.\n22\n23        5\n            Applied formerly was known as Zip-Tron Corp. (“ZTC”). ZTC\n24   was incorporated in Nevada on May 1, 2000. It qualified to do\n     business in California on April 16, 2001. ZTC changed its name\n25   to “Qualtech Applied Engineering Corp.” on October 10, 2006.\n26        6\n            We use the term “Qualtech Assets” in the very limited and\n27   specific sense of the Qualtech assets sold in the Qualtech sale.\n     Assets of the debtor, Dynamic, Electronic and Applied, as\n28                                                         continue...\n\n                                      4\n\f 1        However, the debtor did not intend to own the Qualtech\n 2   Assets.   He expressed his intent in the Asset Purchase Agreement\n 3   to assign his rights and obligations under the Asset Purchase\n 4   Agreement to Applied.\n 5        Specifically, Article 2, Section 2.01 of the Asset Purchase\n 6   Agreement provided:\n 7        [The debtor] plans to assign his rights, and delegate\n          his obligations, under this [Asset Purchase Agreement],\n 8        to a legal entity to be formed. Such legal entity may\n          be a corporation or a limited liability company so long\n 9        as it is wholly owned and controlled by [the debtor].\n          In connection with such assignment and delegation, [the\n10        debtor] and such legal entity shall execute and deliver\n          an Assignment and Assumption Agreement [(“Assignment”)]\n11        . . . .\n12        The Assignment named Applied as the assignee.   Article 1,\n13   Section 1.01 of the Assignment provided:\n14        [The debtor] hereby assigns to [Applied] all of his\n          rights, and hereby delegates to [Applied] all of his\n15        duties, under the Asset Purchase Agreement. [Applied]\n          hereby accepts such assignment and delegation.\n16\n17   The Assignment further provided that Applied “will own and\n18   operate [Qualtech’s] Business after the [sale] Closing (as\n19   defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement).”   Qualtech consented to\n20   the assignment.7\n21\n22\n          6\n           ...continue\n23   relevant to this disposition, are referred to collectively as the\n24   “Business Assets.”\n          7\n25          We have taken some of the facts from a joint pretrial\n     order filed and entered on December 29, 2011, in the docket of\n26   AP No. 09-1669. We exercise our discretion to take judicial\n27   notice of documents electronically filed in the adversary\n     proceeding. See Atwood v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Co.\n28   (In re Atwood), 293 B.R. 227, 233 n.9 (9th Cir. BAP 2003).\n\n                                      5\n\f 1        Although the debtor assigned to Applied all of his rights\n 2   and obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement, “[s]uch\n 3   assignment and delegation shall not act as a release of [the\n 4   debtor] and [he] shall remain legally responsible for the\n 5   performance of all of the obligations of Buyer (as defined in the\n 6   Asset Purchase Agreement) under the Asset Purchase Agreement.”\n 7        The debtor also entered into a sublease with Qualtech to\n 8   lease its facility (“sublease”), agreeing to pay all of the rent\n 9   for the facility.   He agreed to hold Qualtech harmless from any\n10   liability arising from any failure to perform under the sublease.\n11   The landlord consented to the sublease.\n12        The debtor further entered into separate consulting\n13   agreements with Root and Kerchner whereby they each agreed to\n14   provide consulting services relating to Applied’s business in\n15   exchange for consulting fees totaling $375,000 each.   The debtor\n16   was to pay the consulting fees in equal monthly installments over\n17   five years.\n18        Qualtech expressed its intent in the Asset Purchase\n19   Agreement to cease all business activities following the sale.\n20   However, Qualtech would continue to remain obligated as the\n21   master tenant for the facility.   Qualtech became inactive on\n22   April 1, 2008.   However, Qualtech later obtained a certificate of\n23   revivor effective August 23, 2010.\n24        For several years, the debtor operated the businesses out of\n25   the facility.    The debtor’s mother, Dolores, took care of various\n26   administrative matters for the businesses.   She also was an\n27   officer and director of the businesses.\n28        Dolores helped the debtor and the businesses in other ways\n\n                                       6\n\f 1   as well.    Under two separate loan agreements, both dated June 20,\n 2   2005,8 Dolores loaned the debtor and the businesses a total of\n 3   $250,000.   According to the debtor, he needed the funds “to close\n 4   out the deal with [Root] and [Kerchner].”   As noted above, the\n 5   purchase price for the Qualtech Assets under the Asset Purchase\n 6   Agreement was $250,000.\n 7        On November 1, 2006, Applied, Electronic and the debtor\n 8   obtained a $1 million loan from Vineyard Bank.   Vineyard Bank\n 9   filed UCC-1 financing statements perfecting its security\n10   interests in the assets of Applied and Electronic in November\n11   2006.\n12        Pursuant to the loan agreements, Dolores sent the debtor a\n13   written notice of demand, dated January 8, 2008 (“demand\n14   letter”), requiring the debtor to make full payment by March 15,\n15\n16        8\n            The debtor and Dolores entered into a loan agreement,\n17   dated June 20, 2005, wherein Dolores loaned the debtor $250,000,\n     payable within 60 days of Dolores providing a written notice of\n18   demand. The debtor personally guaranteed the loan, granting\n19   Dolores a security interest in “his assets and properties until\n     this Loan is paid in full.”\n20        The businesses (i.e., Dynamic, Electronic and Applied) and\n     Dolores entered into their own loan agreement, also dated\n21   June 20, 2005, wherein Dolores loaned the businesses $250,000,\n22   payable within 60 days of Dolores providing a written notice of\n     demand. The loan to the businesses was “secured by the following\n23   equipment (the Security): All current and future assets of the\n     [businesses].” The businesses granted Dolores a security\n24\n     interest in “the Security until this Loan is paid in full.” As\n25   president and CEO of the businesses, the debtor signed the loan\n     agreement on their behalf.\n26        Notably, the two loan agreements contained nearly identical\n27   provisions. The record reflects that the two loan agreements\n     encompassed a single $250,000 loan. Dolores did not file a UCC-1\n28   financing statement to perfect her security interest at the time.\n\n                                       7\n\f 1   2008.9    When the debtor failed to comply with the demand letter,\n 2   she sent another letter, dated March 26, 2008, advising him that\n 3   she was exercising her right under the loan agreements to\n 4   repossess the Business Assets.10\n 5        The debtor and Dolores thereafter entered into a loan\n 6   resolution agreement, dated March 31, 2008.    Under the loan\n 7   resolution agreement, Dolores was to take immediate possession of\n 8   her collateral.11   No mention was made in the loan resolution\n 9   agreement of Dolores foreclosing her security interest in the\n10   Business Assets.    The loan resolution agreement further does not\n11   provide for any transfer of title or ownership of the Business\n12   Assets, and the Business Assets apparently remained in place.\n13   Dolores agreed to lease the equipment to the debtor on certain\n14   conditions, including:    1) Dolores making payments on the\n15\n          9\n16          In the demand letter, Dolores stated that she had made a\n     $250,000 loan to Dynamic. She listed both the debtor and Dynamic\n17   as addressees. However, she addressed the debtor directly and\n     sought repayment from him.\n18\n          10\n19          In the March 26, 2008 letter, Dolores advised the debtor\n     that she was going to “exercise her rights under section 6 of the\n20   agreement and take possession of the security items defined in\n     our agreement.” Dolores also stated that she was “disappointed\n21\n     that [the debtor] did not comply with her request of January 8,\n22   2008 for repayment of the $250,000 [she] loaned [the debtor] on\n     June 20, 2005.”\n23        In the March 26, 2008 letter, Dolores addressed the debtor\n24   directly (i.e., as the recipient). As in the demand letter, she\n     also listed both the debtor and Dynamic as the addressees.\n25\n          11\n            The loan resolution agreement stated that it was between\n26   the debtor and Dolores. It also stated that “[i]n exchange for\n27   the option to use this equipment, [Dolores would] lease use of it\n     to [the debtor] . . . .” The debtor did not list any equipment\n28   among his personal property assets on Schedule B.\n\n                                        8\n\f 1   debtor’s line of credit; and 2) the debtor paying Dolores $6,000\n 2   per month, starting in April 2009.\n 3        In a letter dated June 19, 2008, Dolores informed the debtor\n 4   that she was “unhappy” with the “direction and results of the\n 5   company.”   She advised him that she was “exercising her right to\n 6   demand payment in full of $165,000.”   However, to make repayment\n 7   easier for him, Dolores declined to collect interest on the loan.\n 8   She purportedly obtained a lien securing future repayment of the\n 9   loan, recognizing that “the current economic conditions of the\n10   company” made immediate repayment difficult.   There is no\n11   evidence in the record that Dolores took any action to have the\n12   “lien” attach or to perfect it; she only referenced the lien in\n13   her letter.\n14        Thereafter, on January 1, 2009, Applied defaulted under the\n15   lease by failing to pay the rent for the facility.    After\n16   notifying Applied and the debtor of the default, the landlord\n17   initiated an unlawful detainer action against Creditors, Applied\n18   and the debtor.   On March 23, 2009, the landlord obtained a\n19   $205,470.84 judgment against Creditors for past due rent and\n20   rental value damages and attorney’s fees and costs (“landlord\n21   judgment”).\n22        Contributing to the flurry of collection activity against\n23   the debtor and the businesses, Dolores sent the debtor a letter,\n24   dated April 30, 2009 (“breach of contract letter”).    In the\n25   breach of contract letter, Dolores notified the debtor that she\n26   would take immediate possession of all of Dynamic’s equipment,\n27   tools, etc., as the debtor had failed to make the monthly loan\n28   payments in breach of the loan agreement.   Again, apparently all\n\n                                      9\n\f 1   of the Business Assets remained in place.\n 2        Due to the landlord judgment against them, on May 8, 2009,\n 3   Creditors initiated a state court action against the debtor and\n 4   Applied for breach of the sublease, declaratory relief as to the\n 5   right of indemnity from Applied and the debtor on the landlord\n 6   judgment and breach of guaranty against the debtor (“state court\n 7   action”).\n 8        On June 8, 2009, the debtor and Dolores entered into a\n 9   “voluntary foreclosure and repossession agreement” (“turnover\n10   agreement”).   Under the turnover agreement, Dolores took all of\n11   the debtor’s right, title and interest in and possession of the\n12   Business Assets, which included Dynamic’s and Electronic’s\n13   machines, tools and equipment.   Specifically, the turnover\n14   agreement provided:\n15        [The debtor] hereby continuously and irrevocably\n          tenders to [Dolores] without need of judicial\n16        proceedings, all right, title and interest, and full\n          possession of, in and to all of its Asset Collateral,\n17        which [the debtor] now owns or will own as a result of\n          the daily operation of its business. All such Asset\n18        Collateral not now in [Dolores’] possession shall be\n          deemed received and held by [the debtor] in trust for\n19        and subject to the sole discretion of [Dolores] until\n          [her] acceptance of such tender of possession.\n20\n21   Notably, the turnover agreement included a list of various\n22   machines and a list of equipment.     Applied was not a party to the\n23   turnover agreement.\n24        At the time she entered into the turnover agreement, Dolores\n25   was doing business as Kaufman Group.    She soon transferred the\n26   Business Assets acquired under the turnover agreement to Kaufman\n27   Group.   Using the Business Assets, Dolores began operating out of\n28   the facility, making and selling the same products previously\n\n                                      10\n\f 1   made and sold by the businesses.\n 2        Dynamic filed a certificate of dissolution with the\n 3   California Secretary of State on June 22, 2009.    Electronic and\n 4   Applied filed certificates of dissolution with the California\n 5   Secretary of State on July 10, 2009.\n 6   B.   The debtor’s chapter 7 bankruptcy and adversary proceedings\n 7        On July 15, 2009, the debtor filed his chapter 7 bankruptcy\n 8   petition.    He listed his interests in Applied, Electronic and\n 9   Dynamic on Schedule B, but noted that they were no longer in\n10   business.    He did not list any of the Business Assets as his own.\n11   The debtor named Applied, Electronic and Dynamic as co-debtors on\n12   his Schedule H.    He listed Dolores on Schedule F with a $250,000\n13   general unsecured claim based on business debt.\n14        The debtor also scheduled Kerchner and Root with general\n15   unsecured claims each in the amount of $605,000, both based on\n16   business debts.    He also listed Vineyard Bank with a $1,165,000\n17   general unsecured claim based on trade debt.    Two months after\n18   the initial § 341(a) meeting, Trustee filed a no asset report on\n19   October 7, 2009.12\n20        1.     Preference Adversary\n21        On January 1, 2011, Trustee and Creditors filed a complaint\n22   against Dolores (AP No. 11-1026) under §§ 547, 548, 550 and 551\n23   to commence the Preference Adversary.\n24        In their complaint, Trustee and Creditors highlighted the\n25   lack of documentation for the following in their allegations:\n26   1) attachment and perfection of Dolores’ security interests and\n27\n          12\n28             The debtor received his discharge on March 25, 2013.\n\n                                        11\n\f 1   liens in the Business Assets; 2) the provision of the loan funds\n 2   to the debtor and the businesses; 3) the transfer of the Qualtech\n 3   Assets to Applied; and 4) the repossession of the Business Assets\n 4   by Dolores.   They also pointed out that the debtor, the\n 5   businesses and/or Dolores did not provide any third party notice\n 6   of the transfer of the Business Assets to Dolores.\n 7        Trustee and Creditors further alleged that there was such a\n 8   unity of interest between the debtor and Dolores and the\n 9   businesses, the businesses were their alter egos.    They cited\n10   numerous examples in support, including allegations that:\n11   1) funds were moved between the businesses without regard to the\n12   source or obligations; 2) the businesses had the same officers\n13   and directors (i.e., the debtor and Dolores); 3) Kaufman Group\n14   continued to use the trade names of Applied and Electronic and to\n15   service the same customers; and 4) the debtor received\n16   compensation (in the form of payment for his rent and the use of\n17   a Mercedes Benz for his wife) for providing consultation services\n18   to Kaufman Group.\n19        They also pointed out that the debtor scheduled Dolores as a\n20   general unsecured creditor, even though she took possession of\n21   the Business Assets prepetition and supposedly had a valid\n22   security interest in them.   Moreover, even though the debtor\n23   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores as a form of payment\n24   on the $250,000 loan, he did not characterize the transfer in his\n25   bankruptcy schedules as a credit against the debt owed to\n26   Dolores.\n27        Given these facts, Trustee and Creditors argued that the\n28   debtor and Dolores fraudulently transferred the Business Assets\n\n                                     12\n\f 1   to Dolores through their alter egos in order to thwart Creditors’\n 2   attempts to obtain judgment against the debtor, and to continue\n 3   the operations of the businesses.\n 4        Seven months after Dolores filed her answer, Trustee and\n 5   Creditors moved for partial summary judgment against them on the\n 6   §§ 547(b) and 548(a)(1) claims (“partial summary judgment\n 7   motion”).\n 8        With respect to their § 547(b) claim, Trustee and Creditors\n 9   averred that they met all of the elements for establishing an\n10   avoidable preferential transfer.       They focused on one element in\n11   particular: the Business Assets as property of the debtor and/or\n12   the bankruptcy estate.\n13        Trustee and Creditors contended that because the debtor\n14   wholly owned the businesses, they became assets of the bankruptcy\n15   estate when he filed for bankruptcy.      Under Cal. Corp. Code\n16   § 2004, corporate assets are distributed to shareholders upon\n17   dissolution of the corporation.    Here, had the debtor not\n18   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores, they would have been\n19   distributed to him as the sole shareholder.      The Business Assets\n20   then would have become part of the bankruptcy estate when he\n21   filed for bankruptcy.\n22        Alternatively, Trustee and Creditors claimed that the debtor\n23   owned the Qualtech Assets, not Applied.      He never produced\n24   documents showing that he transferred the Qualtech Assets to\n25   Applied pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and Assignment.\n26   Moreover, he treated the Business Assets as his personal assets\n27   when he pledged them as security on the personal loan.\n28        Trustee and Creditors further argued that the debtor\n\n                                       13\n\f 1   actually owned the Business Assets because the businesses were\n 2   his alter egos.   Under California law, although a corporation\n 3   typically is an entity separate and distinct from its\n 4   stockholders, it is considered an individual’s alter ego when\n 5   there is such a unity of interest between the individual and the\n 6   corporation as to negate the corporation’s separateness.   In\n 7   other words, the corporation is considered the individual’s alter\n 8   ego when he uses it for convenience to transact his business in\n 9   such a way that amounts to fraud or injustice against third\n10   parties.\n11        Here, the debtor admitted at the § 341(a) meeting that he\n12   moved funds between the businesses without regard to the source\n13   or obligations, even though he maintained separate bank accounts.\n14   Also, the debtor was the sole shareholder of the businesses.     He\n15   and Dolores were the only officers and directors of the\n16   businesses.\n17        As for the § 548(a)(1) claim, Trustee and Creditors\n18   contended that the debtor received less than reasonably\n19   equivalent value in exchange for the transfer of the Business\n20   Assets to Dolores.   Specifically, although he owed Dolores only\n21   $250,000, he transferred all of the Business Assets, which were\n22   worth more than $560,000.\n23        They also argued that, based on circumstances surrounding\n24   the transfers, the debtor had actual intent to hinder, delay or\n25   defraud creditors when he transferred the Business Assets to\n26   Dolores.   Several badges of fraud existed, demonstrating the\n27   debtor’s fraudulent intent, including:   1) as an officer and\n28   director of the businesses, Dolores was an insider; 2) the debtor\n\n                                     14\n\f 1   concealed the transfer by failing to provide public notice to\n 2   creditors and by failing to comply with California bulk sales\n 3   law; 3) the debtor transferred the Business Assets to Dolores\n 4   less than a month after being served with Creditors’ state court\n 5   complaint; and 4) the debtor became insolvent after he\n 6   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores.\n 7        Dolores opposed the partial summary judgment motion\n 8   asserting that Trustee and Creditors failed to show that no\n 9   material factual issues existed as to their §§ 547(b) and 548(a)\n10   claims.\n11        With respect to the § 547(b) claim, Dolores contended that\n12   Trustee and Creditors could not show that no material factual\n13   issue existed as to whether the transfer involved property of the\n14   debtor.   She claimed that evidence showed that the debtor never\n15   personally owned the Business Assets.   Under the Asset Purchase\n16   Agreement, Applied was the intended purchaser of the Qualtech\n17   Assets.   The debtor simply was the placeholder, holding the\n18   Qualtech Assets until Applied could be established.   The\n19   Assignment further supports this intent.\n20        Also, the Business Assets did not belong to the debtor\n21   because Dolores took possession of the Business Assets on\n22   March 31, 2008, then leased them back to the debtor and the\n23   businesses.   Neither the debtor nor the businesses owned the\n24   Business Assets after March 31, 2008; they simply were leasing\n25   them.   In other words, they held a leasehold interest in the\n26   Business Assets only, similar to holding the Business Assets in\n27   trust for Dolores.\n28        Moreover, the transfer of the Business Assets to Dolores\n\n                                     15\n\f 1   occurred outside of the statutory preference period under\n 2   § 547(b).   Section 547(b)(4)(B) requires that the transfer take\n 3   place up to one year prepetition.     Here, Dolores took possession\n 4   of the Business Assets on March 31, 2008.\n 5        She also disputed Trustee and Creditors’ allegation that the\n 6   businesses were her and the debtor’s alter egos.    Each of the\n 7   businesses filed its own tax returns, conducted separate\n 8   operations and maintained separate books and records.    Funds were\n 9   transferred between the businesses because goods and services\n10   were exchanged between them.    Further, Dolores made loans to each\n11   of the businesses and the debtor separately.    The debtor did not\n12   use all of the loans for his personal benefit.    Additionally,\n13   Dolores was not paying the debtor a consulting fee; she simply\n14   was helping his family with its expenses.\n15        Dolores further argued that Trustee and Creditors failed to\n16   show that no material factual issue existed as to whether Dolores\n17   received more than she would have under a chapter 7 liquidation.\n18   She was a secured creditor who was entitled to repayment of the\n19   entire loan.    Payment to a fully secured creditor is not\n20   preferential because it does not deplete the bankruptcy estate as\n21   such payment reduces the secured creditor’s lien in an equal\n22   amount.\n23        Dolores also raised the new value defense under § 547(c)(1),\n24   claiming that she and the debtor intended that the transfer of\n25   the Business Assets be a contemporaneous exchange for new value\n26   given to him.\n27        The bankruptcy court held a hearing on the partial summary\n28   judgment motion on September 18, 2012.    It concluded that the\n\n                                      16\n\f 1   debtor’s ownership interests in the businesses constituted\n 2   property of the estate within the meaning of § 541.    The\n 3   bankruptcy court referenced the loan agreements, the loan\n 4   resolution agreement and the turnover agreement.     It pointed out\n 5   that all of these agreements had been between the debtor and\n 6   Dolores.    The bankruptcy court acknowledged that\n 7        [S]ome other entities that [the debtor] controlled also\n          had an interest in all those assets. But it [was]\n 8        pretty clear that – you look at the agreements between\n          Dolores Stout and Edward Stout, and the reference to\n 9        the assets is the reference to him. It’s only to him\n          individually, in the body of the actual document.\n10\n11   Tr. of Sept. 18, 2012 hr’g, 6:7-12.\n12        The bankruptcy court also determined that the perfection of\n13   Dolores’s security interests, through the filing of a UCC-1\n14   financing statement on May 27, 2009, was within the preference\n15   period.    At the summary judgment hearing, the bankruptcy court\n16   wondered, “[i]f [Dolores] was the owner of the property, why on\n17   earth would she file a UCC-1 in 2009, on her own property?”\n18   Tr. of Sept. 18, 2012 h’rg, 2:22-25.    It also noted that Dolores\n19   took further steps to perfect her security interest by executing\n20   the turnover agreement, which allowed her to take possession of\n21   the Business Assets immediately.\n22        The bankruptcy court also concluded that Dolores was an\n23   insider within the meaning of § 101(31) as she was the debtor’s\n24   mother.    Consequently, the one-year reach back period of\n25   § 547(b)(4)(B) applied.    It thus granted summary judgment on the\n26   § 547(b) claim, concluding that no genuine triable factual issues\n27   existed as to that claim.\n28        The bankruptcy court denied summary judgment on the\n\n                                      17\n\f 1   § 548(a)(1) claim.    It found that triable issues of material fact\n 2   existed as to the § 548(a)(1) claim.13\n 3        On January 23, 2013, the bankruptcy court entered the\n 4   § 547(b) partial summary judgment order in favor of Creditors.\n 5   Dolores timely appealed the § 547(b) partial summary judgment\n 6   order.    The bankruptcy court entered a Rule 54(b) certification\n 7   thereafter.\n 8        2.     Discharge Adversary\n 9        On October 20, 2009, before the Preference Adversary was\n10   filed, Creditors filed a complaint (“Discharge Complaint”)\n11   against the debtor, initially asserting a claim under\n12   § 727(a)(2)(A) only.    Under a stipulation entered February 9,\n13   2010, the debtor agreed to allow Creditors to amend their\n14   complaint to include a claim under § 523(a)(6).    AP No. 09-1669\n15   Docket Nos. 9 and 10.    Creditors filed their amended complaint on\n16   March 16, 2010, including a claim under § 523(a)(6).\n17        With respect to their § 523(a)(6) claim, Creditors asserted\n18   that the businesses were the debtor’s alter egos.    They then\n19   alleged that the debtor “conspired” with Dolores “to thwart” the\n20   pending state court action and to hinder, delay and defraud them\n21   by fraudulently transferring the Business Assets to Dolores\n22   and/or Kaufman Group.    Finally, they alleged that such acts\n23   willfully and maliciously injured Creditors.\n24        Alternatively, they argued that the debtor’s discharge\n25   should be denied under § 727(a)(2)(A) because, within one year\n26\n          13\n27          Since disposition of the § 548(a)(1) claim has no\n     relevance to the disposition in this appeal, we will not refer to\n28   it further herein.\n\n                                       18\n\f 1   prior to filing for bankruptcy, he transferred the Business\n 2   Assets to Dolores and/or Kaufman Group with the intent to prevent\n 3   Creditors from obtaining and collecting a judgment against him in\n 4   the state court action.\n 5        Several months after he filed his answer to the Discharge\n 6   Complaint, the debtor moved for summary judgment (“debtor summary\n 7   judgment motion”), asserting that Creditors failed to establish\n 8   the elements of their § 727(a)(2)(A) and § 523(a)(6) claims.\n 9        With respect to the § 727(a)(2)(A) claim, the debtor argued\n10   that he never owned the Qualtech Assets at any time.    At the time\n11   of the Qualtech sale, the debtor merely held the Qualtech Assets\n12   for Applied.14    The Asset Purchase Agreement specifically\n13   contemplated that a business entity would be the “true” purchaser\n14   of the Qualtech Assets; the debtor simply was a placeholder.\n15   Moreover, Applied owned the Qualtech Assets until March 2008,\n16   when Dolores allegedly foreclosed on the Business Assets.\n17   Because the debtor never truly owned the Qualtech Assets, there\n18   could not have been a transfer within the meaning of\n19   § 727(a)(2)(A).\n20        He also maintained that the businesses never were his alter\n21   egos.     The businesses filed their own tax returns and maintained\n22   separate books and records.    They also maintained separate bank\n23   accounts; they did not commingle any funds with the debtor.\n24        The debtor further contended that the transfer of the\n25   Business Assets to Dolores occurred outside the one-year period\n26\n          14\n27           The debtor advanced a number of arguments in his summary\n     judgment motion, but we focus only on those relevant to the\n28   appeal.\n\n                                       19\n\f 1   under § 727(a)(2)(A).   Although Dolores did not file her UCC-1\n 2   financing statement until May 27, 2009, the debtor alleged that\n 3   she had a perfected security interest.   The transfers of the\n 4   Business Assets to Dolores through the attachment of her security\n 5   interest became effective on June 20, 2005 when she signed the\n 6   loan agreements.\n 7        He also contended that Creditors failed to show that he had\n 8   actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud them at the time he\n 9   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores.   She had a valid\n10   security interest in the Business Assets pursuant to the loan\n11   agreements.   Dolores acquired the Business Assets because the\n12   debtor failed to repay his debt to her, not because the debtor\n13   intended to prevent Creditors from obtaining a state court\n14   judgment against him.\n15        As to the § 523(a)(6) claim,15 the debtor argued that\n16   Creditors failed to show that he had a subjective intent to\n17   injure them when he transferred the Business Assets to Dolores.\n18   She had a valid security interest in the Business Assets; Dolores\n19\n20\n          15\n            The debtor also argued that Creditors could not assert\n21   their § 523(a)(6) claim because it was time-barred under\n22   Rule 4007(c).\n          Rule 4007(c) provides that the deadline to file a complaint\n23   to except a debt from discharge, including under § 523(a)(6), is\n     60 days after the first date set for the § 341(a) meeting of\n24\n     creditors. The initial § 341(a) meeting of creditors in the\n25   debtor’s bankruptcy case was scheduled for August 21, 2009.\n     According to Form B9A, the “Notice of Commencement of Case under\n26   the Bankruptcy Code, Meeting of Creditors and Deadlines,” that\n27   was filed and entered on July 20, 2009 in the debtor’s bankruptcy\n     case (main case docket no. 3), the deadline to file\n28   dischargeability complaints was October 20, 2009.\n\n                                     20\n\f 1   simply exercised her right to repossess them pursuant to the loan\n 2   agreements.\n 3        He also argued that the debt owed to Creditors arose out of\n 4   a breach of contract, which is not recognized as a debt excepted\n 5   from discharge under any of the provisions of § 523(a).\n 6        The debtor further sought to dismiss Qualtech as a\n 7   plaintiff.    When Creditors filed the Discharge Complaint,\n 8   Qualtech was suspended for failing to pay taxes.    Qualtech\n 9   therefore lacked the capacity to commence and prosecute the\n10   Discharge Adversary against him.\n11        Creditors filed an opposition to the debtor’s summary\n12   judgment motion.    They opposed it on procedural grounds only,\n13   contending that the debtor filed his summary judgment motion\n14   untimely.    They also argued that notice of the hearing on the\n15   summary judgment motion was defective as the notice was served\n16   untimely.\n17        Before the December 16, 2010 hearing on the summary judgment\n18   motion,16 the bankruptcy court issued a tentative ruling.      In its\n19   tentative ruling, the bankruptcy court indicated an intent to\n20   grant the debtor’s summary judgment motion as to the § 523(a)(6)\n21   claim, but to deny the summary judgment motion as to the\n22   § 727(a)(2)(A) claim.    At the summary judgment hearing, the\n23   bankruptcy court adopted its tentative ruling.\n24\n25\n          16\n            Within the Central District of California, a hearing\n26   automatically is scheduled on a motion for summary judgment,\n27   whether or not an opposition is filed. See Rule 7056-1(a) and\n     Rule 9013-1(a)(5) of the Local Bankruptcy Rules for the\n28   Bankruptcy Court of the Central District of California.\n\n                                      21\n\f 1        On March 21, 2011, the bankruptcy court entered the\n 2   § 523(a)(6) partial summary judgment order.   It granted summary\n 3   judgment in the debtor’s favor as to the § 523(a)(6) claim on two\n 4   grounds:   first, concluding that the § 523(a)(6) claim was not\n 5   timely filed and, further, determining that Creditors did not\n 6   raise any material factual issue concerning the debtor’s intent\n 7   to cause injury within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n 8        The bankruptcy court denied summary judgment on the\n 9   § 727(a)(2)(A) claim, determining that genuine material factual\n10   issues existed as to the following:   1) the significance and\n11   legal effect of the transfer of the Qualtech Assets to Applied;\n12   2) the existence of alter ego; 3) the circumstances concerning\n13   Dolores’ taking possession of the Business Assets; and 4) the\n14   debtor’s intent to hinder, delay or defraud Creditors.\n15        The bankruptcy court further determined that there was\n16   insufficient admissible evidence as to Qualtech’s legal status as\n17   of the filing of the Discharge Complaint.   It also determined\n18   that the debtor failed to address the issue involving Qualtech’s\n19   certificate of revivor.\n20        The remaining claim in the Discharge Complaint proceeded to\n21   trial.   In preparation for the trial, the debtor and Creditors\n22   submitted a joint pretrial order.\n23        In the joint pretrial order, they agreed and admitted to\n24   several facts, including that:   1) the debtor wholly owned and\n25   controlled the businesses by June 20, 2005; 2) Dolores was an\n26   officer and director of the businesses by June 20, 2005; 3) the\n27   debtor and the businesses entered into the loan agreements with\n28   Dolores; 4) the debtor or his allowed assignee was the purchaser\n\n                                      22\n\f 1   under the Asset Purchase Agreement; 5) the debtor personally\n 2   guaranteed performance under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the\n 3   sublease and the consulting agreements; 6) Dolores took\n 4   possession of the Business Assets two months before the debtor\n 5   filed his chapter 7 petition; and 7) Qualtech was under\n 6   suspension from April 1, 2008 until August 23, 2010, when it\n 7   filed its certificate of revivor.\n 8        The debtor and Creditors also listed several factual issues\n 9   remaining to be litigated, including:   1) whether the debtor was\n10   the alter ego of the businesses; 2) whether the debtor acted to\n11   transfer, conceal, destroy or remove the Business Assets; and\n12   3) whether the debtor had actual intent to defraud, delay or\n13   hinder Creditors through his actions within one year prepetition.\n14        Before the trial, the bankruptcy court addressed several\n15   pretrial motions filed by the debtor.   In one pretrial motion,\n16   the debtor again sought to dismiss Qualtech as a plaintiff for\n17   lack of standing to prosecute the Discharge Complaint (“pretrial\n18   motion”).   AP No. 09-1669 Docket No. 82.   Following a hearing,\n19   the bankruptcy court granted the pretrial motion, entering the\n20   order on May 15, 2012.   AP No. 09-1669 Docket No. 138.   It\n21   concluded that Qualtech lacked capacity to prosecute the\n22   Discharge Adversary because at the time it was filed on\n23   October 20, 2009, Qualtech was under suspension.\n24        The bankruptcy court held a four-day trial.    It issued its\n25   ruling orally on March 1, 2013 (“Trial Findings Hearing”).\n26        At the outset of the Trial Findings Hearing, the bankruptcy\n27   court stressed that it reviewed all admissible evidence\n28   independent from any other pending adversary proceeding, i.e.,\n\n                                     23\n\f 1   the Preference Adversary.   It then went on to state that\n 2   Creditors had established all but one of the elements of\n 3   § 727(a)(2)(A).\n 4        It found that the debtor transferred all of the Business\n 5   Assets to Dolores within one year of his bankruptcy filing with\n 6   the actual intent to hinder, delay and defraud Creditors.   The\n 7   bankruptcy court noted that the evidence showed that the transfer\n 8   of the Business Assets to Dolores “was designed to ensure\n 9   protection of [her] interest as a creditor to the detriment of\n10   [Creditors].”   Tr. of March 1, 2013 hr’g, 6:7-8.\n11        It inferred that the debtor had fraudulent intent in\n12   transferring the Business Assets to Dolores based on the\n13   circumstances surrounding the transfer.   The bankruptcy court\n14   pointed out that Dolores had a close relationship with the debtor\n15   because she was his mother.   It also noted that the debtor made\n16   the transfer very shortly after Creditors initiated the state\n17   court action.   The bankruptcy court further pointed out that the\n18   debtor transferred substantially all of the Business Assets to\n19   Dolores which left “other creditors with little from which to\n20   recover on their claims.”   Tr. of March 1, 2013 hr’g, 6:23-24.\n21        However, it found that Creditors failed to show that the\n22   Business Assets were the property of the debtor.    The bankruptcy\n23   court noted that Creditors seemed to rely on its earlier\n24   determination in the Preference Adversary.   There, in its partial\n25   summary judgment order entered January 23, 2013, the bankruptcy\n26   court had found that the debtor’s transfer of the Business Assets\n27   to Dolores under the turnover agreement constituted a\n28   preferential transfer under § 547(b).   It explained to Creditors\n\n                                     24\n\f 1   that its holding in the Preference Adversary had “no bearing on\n 2   [its] ruling in this matter” because:   1) the debtor was not a\n 3   party to the Preference Adversary so he could not raise a defense\n 4   or submit evidence and legal argument regarding the property\n 5   transfer’s characterization; 2) the evidence and legal arguments\n 6   presented in the Preference Adversary “were far more extensive\n 7   and compelling” than the Creditors’ presentation in the Discharge\n 8   Adversary; 3) Creditors provided no evidence showing that the\n 9   debtor was the alter ego of the businesses, even though a joint\n10   pretrial order had listed this as an issue to be determined at\n11   trial.   Tr. of March 1, 2013 hr’g, 7:10-25, 8:1-18.   See\n12   Discussion infra.   The bankruptcy court concluded that, “absent a\n13   finding of alter ego, property belonging to a debtor’s wholly-\n14   owned corporation is property of that entity and not property of\n15   the debtor within the meaning of 727(a)(2).”   Tr. of March 1,\n16   2013 hr’g, 10:8-11.\n17        On March 25, 2013, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in\n18   favor of the debtor on the § 727(a)(2)(A) claim (“§ 727(a)(2)\n19   judgment”).   Two weeks later, Creditors filed the motion for new\n20   trial.\n21        They contended that they established all of the elements of\n22   § 727(a)(2)(A).   In particular, Creditors averred that the\n23   Business Assets were property of the estate within the meaning of\n24   § 727(a)(2)(A).   Under California law, when a corporation is\n25   dissolved, all of its assets automatically are transferred to its\n26   shareholders.   When an individual files for bankruptcy, the\n27   chapter 7 trustee acquires all of his rights and interests in\n28   property.   Any property belonging to the debtor thus becomes part\n\n                                     25\n\f 1   of the bankruptcy estate.\n 2        Here, the debtor owned all of the stock in the businesses.\n 3   When the debtor dissolved the businesses shortly before he filed\n 4   his bankruptcy petition, all of their assets went to the\n 5   businesses’ shareholder – i.e., the debtor.   When he filed for\n 6   bankruptcy, Trustee succeeded to the debtor’s rights and\n 7   interests, including his ownership interest in the Business\n 8   Assets.   The Business Assets thus became part of the bankruptcy\n 9   estate.\n10        Creditors further argued that, under § 727(a)(7), a debtor’s\n11   discharge shall be denied if he is an insider of a corporation\n12   and had fraudulently transferred the corporation’s assets within\n13   the meaning of § 727(a)(2).   Here, the debtor was an officer and\n14   director and sole shareholder of the businesses, which qualified\n15   him as an insider.   Because he fraudulently transferred the\n16   Business Assets to Dolores when he was an insider of the\n17   businesses, his discharge must be denied.\n18        Creditors also maintained that the businesses were the\n19   debtor’s alter egos under California law.   In California, a\n20   person is the alter ego of his corporation if:   1) he owns all of\n21   the corporation’s stock; 2) there is such a unity of interest and\n22   ownership that the separateness of the person and the corporation\n23   has ceased; and 3) an adherence to the fiction of the separate\n24   existence of the corporation would sanction a fraud or promote\n25   injustice.   Here, Creditors averred, all three elements of alter\n26   ego were met:   1) the debtor wholly owned and controlled the\n27   businesses; 2) the debtor admitted at the § 341(a) meeting that\n28   he co-owned with the businesses the Business Assets and\n\n                                     26\n\f 1   commingled his personal assets in the Business Assets in such a\n 2   way that he could not separate them; and 3) adhering to the\n 3   fiction of the separate existence of the businesses would condone\n 4   fraud and promote injustice.\n 5        Creditors further asked the bankruptcy court to reconsider\n 6   its grant of partial summary judgment on the § 523(a)(6) claim.\n 7   Creditors contended that the facts proven at trial showed that\n 8   the debtor intended “to strip the value” from his corporate stock\n 9   by transferring the sale assets to Dolores, an insider.   In doing\n10   so, the debtor caused Creditors willful and malicious injury\n11   within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n12        Following a hearing on May 7, 2013 (“new trial hearing”),\n13   the bankruptcy court denied the motion for new trial.   It noted\n14   that Creditors did not provide any substantive analysis as to how\n15   Civil Rules 52 and 59 and Local Rule 9013-4(a) applied.\n16        The bankruptcy court determined that Creditors misapplied\n17   § 727(a)(7).   It explained that § 727(a)(7) ties together related\n18   cases so that misconduct in one case by an individual may be\n19   chargeable against him in other related cases.   Here, the\n20   businesses never filed for bankruptcy; they were nonbankruptcy\n21   insiders.\n22        Moreover, the bankruptcy court reasoned, even if § 727(a)(7)\n23   applied to nonbankruptcy insiders such as the businesses,\n24   Creditors never included their § 727(a)(7) claim in the joint\n25   pretrial order as a claim to be litigated.\n26        As for their arguments regarding alter ego, the bankruptcy\n27   court found that Creditors failed to address the lack of evidence\n28   of alter ego at trial.   They also failed to proffer appropriate\n\n                                     27\n\f 1   analysis of alter ego under Civil Rules 59 and 52.\n 2        The bankruptcy court further found unpersuasive Creditors’\n 3   argument that the debtor’s dissolution of the businesses shortly\n 4   before his bankruptcy filing required the denial of his\n 5   discharge.   It pointed out that Creditors failed to provide any\n 6   analysis as to how the assets of the debtor’s dissolved\n 7   businesses (if any at the times that the businesses were\n 8   dissolved) legally reverted to the debtor, as shareholder,\n 9   prepetition.\n10        The bankruptcy court denied Creditors’ request to reconsider\n11   its grant of partial summary judgment on their § 523(a)(6) claim\n12   because they failed to present any grounds for reconsideration.\n13   It moreover mentioned that Creditors were seeking reconsideration\n14   of an order that it issued more than two years before.\n15        On May 15, 2013, the bankruptcy court entered the new trial\n16   order.   Creditors timely appealed the new trial order.\n17\n18                              JURISDICTION\n19        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n20   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(F) and (J).    We have jurisdiction under\n21   28 U.S.C. § 158.\n22\n23                                 ISSUES\n24        1) Did the bankruptcy court err in granting partial summary\n25   judgment on the § 547(b) claim by determining that the debtor’s\n26   transfer of the Business Assets to Dolores constituted a\n27   preferential transfer?\n28        2) Did the bankruptcy court err in granting judgment in the\n\n                                     28\n\f 1   debtor’s favor on Creditor’s § 523(a)(6) claim?\n 2        3) Did the bankruptcy court err in granting judgment in the\n 3   debtor’s favor on Creditors’ § 727(a)(2)(A) claim?\n 4\n 5                           STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n 6        We review the bankruptcy court’s legal conclusions de novo.\n 7   Goodrich v. Briones (In re Schwarzkof), 526 F.3d 1032, 1034 (9th\n 8   Cir. 2010).   We also review de novo the bankruptcy court’s grant\n 9   of partial summary judgment.   White v. City of Sparks, 500 F.3d\n10   953, 955 (9th Cir. 2007).   “Summary judgment is appropriate only\n11   if, taking the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn\n12   therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\n13   there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party\n14   is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”      Smith v. Clark\n15   Cnty. Sch. Distr., 727 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir. 2013)(quoting\n16   Furnace v. Sullivan, 705 F.3d 1021, 1026 (9th Cir. 2013)).      The\n17   moving party has the initial burden of demonstrating that no\n18   material fact issues exist.    Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc.,\n19   509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007).\n20        Generally, a court cannot grant summary judgment based on\n21   its assessment of the credibility of the evidence presented.\n22   Barboza v. New Form, Inc. (In re Barboza), 545 F.3d 702, 707 (9th\n23   Cir. 2008)(quoting Agosto v. INS, 436 U.S. 748, 756 (1978)).       At\n24   the summary judgment stage, the bankruptcy court’s function is\n25   not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter.\n26   Barboza, 545 F.3d at 707 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\n27   Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)).      Rather, it simply must\n28   determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.      Barboza,\n\n                                      29\n\f 1   545 F.3d at 707 (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249).\n 2        We review the bankruptcy court’s factual findings under the\n 3   clearly erroneous standard.    United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d\n 4   1247, 1252 & n.20 (9th Cir. 2009)(en banc).   Determinations of\n 5   alter ego typically are factual findings, which we review for\n 6   clear error.   Schwarzkof, 526 F.3d at 1034 (citing Towe Antique\n 7   Ford Found. v. IRS, 999 F.2d 1891, 1897 (9th Cir. 1993)).    We\n 8   must affirm the bankruptcy court’s factual findings unless we\n 9   conclude that they are “(1) ‘illogical,’ (2) ‘implausible,’ or\n10   (3) without ‘support in inferences that may be drawn from the\n11   facts in the record.’”   Hinkson, 585 F.3d at 1252.   Clear error\n12   exists when, on the entire evidence, the reviewing court is left\n13   with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made.\n14   Oney v. Weinberg (In re Weinberg), 410 B.R. 19, 28 (9th Cir.\n15   2009); Hoopai v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (In re Hoopai),\n16   369 B.R. 506, 509 (9th Cir. BAP 2007).\n17        We may affirm on any ground supported by the record.    White,\n18   500 F.3d at 955.\n19\n20                                 DISCUSSION\n21   A.   Preference Adversary\n22        1.    Motion to Supplement Record\n23        Before we begin our analysis, we must address a procedural\n24   matter:   Dolores’ motion to supplement the record on appeal\n25   (“supplement record motion”).    All of the supplemental documents\n26   submitted for our review concern Trustee’s application to employ\n27   Creditors’ adversary counsel as his special counsel in the\n28\n\n                                       30\n\f 1   underlying bankruptcy case.17\n 2        Having reviewed the supplemental documents, we conclude that\n 3   the supplemental documents would not be helpful in our\n 4   determination of Dolores’ appeal.    We thus deny the supplement\n 5   record motion.18\n 6        2.    Appeal of the § 547(b) partial summary judgment order\n 7        Under § 547(b), the transfer of a debtor’s interest in\n 8   property made to an insider within one year prior to the debtor’s\n 9   bankruptcy filing may be avoided as a preference if six elements\n10   are met.   Sigma Micro Corp. v. Healthcentral.com\n11   (In re Healthcentral.com), 504 F.3d 775, 788 (9th Cir. 2007).      A\n12   preferential transfer consists of the following six elements:\n13   1) a transfer of the debtor’s interest in property; 2) that was\n14   to or for a creditor’s benefit; 3) that was for or on account of\n15   an antecedent debt; 4) that was made while the debtor was\n16   insolvent; 5) that was made up to one year prepetition, if such\n17   creditor was an insider; and 6) that was a transfer that enables\n18   the creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive in\n19   a chapter 7 liquidation of the bankruptcy estate.    Hansen v.\n20   MacDonald Meat Co. (In re Kemp Pac. Fisheries, Inc.), 16 F.3d\n21\n          17\n22          This same counsel also represented Creditors in the state\n     court action.\n23\n          18\n            Shortly before oral argument, the debtor, Creditors and\n24\n     Dolores each submitted additional authorities in support of their\n25   briefs. The debtor and Dolores objected to Creditors’\n     submissions and moved to strike them. We deny the debtor’s and\n26   Dolores’ motions to strike. After considering all of these\n27   submissions, however, we conclude that the supplemental\n     authorities cited by the debtor, Creditors and Dolores do not\n28   assist us materially in our dispositions of these appeals.\n\n                                     31\n\f 1   313, 315 n.1 (9th Cir. 1994).    All six of these elements must be\n 2   met, Wind Power Sys., Inc. v. Cannon Fin. Group, Inc. (In re Wind\n 3   Power Sys., Inc.), 841 F.2d 288, 290 (9th Cir. 1988)(en banc)\n 4   (citation omitted), and each must be proven by a preponderance of\n 5   the evidence.    Arrow Elecs., Inc. v. Justus (In re Kaypro),\n 6   218 F.3d 1070, 1073 (9th Cir. 2000).\n 7        Dolores claims that she provided sufficient evidence to\n 8   raise genuine material factual issues as to three of these\n 9   elements:    1) whether the transfer involved the debtor’s\n10   property; 2) whether the transfer was made within the preference\n11   period; and 3) whether Dolores, as a secured creditor, received\n12   more than she would have received in a chapter 7 liquidation.\n13               a.   Property of the debtor\n14        Dolores first argues that she submitted evidence raising\n15   questions as to whether the Business Assets ever constituted the\n16   debtor’s property.    Dolores asserts that the debtor never\n17   intended to own the Business Assets.      She references the Asset\n18   Purchase Agreement and the Assignment, both of which provided\n19   that Applied would own the Qualtech Assets when the debtor\n20   assigned his rights under the Asset Purchase Agreement and made\n21   the Assignment to Applied.\n22        Dolores contends that she presented further evidence raising\n23   material factual issues as to whether the debtor owned the\n24   Business Assets under the alter ego theory.      She provided\n25   evidence that the businesses each kept separate books and\n26   records, even though they operated out of the same facility.\n27   Dolores also submitted evidence showing that the businesses did\n28   not transfer funds between themselves without regard to source or\n\n                                      32\n\f 1   obligation, as Creditors alleged.     The businesses exchanged funds\n 2   for various goods and services they provided to one another.\n 3        However, Dolores seeks to manufacture a genuine issue of\n 4   fact out of her subjective intent, which is belied by the reality\n 5   of her documented transactions with respect to the Business\n 6   Assets.    As the bankruptcy court pointed out, Dolores relies on\n 7   documents that indicated that the debtor owned the Business\n 8   Assets.    The loan resolution agreement was between Dolores and\n 9   the debtor only.    None of the businesses was a party to the loan\n10   resolution agreement.    The loan resolution agreement further\n11   allowed Dolores to take immediate possession of collateral under\n12   her loan agreement with the debtor, but the loan resolution\n13   agreement did not provide for any transfer of title or ownership.\n14   In fact, the loan resolution agreement left the Business Assets\n15   in place with the debtor.\n16        Dynamic and Electronic along with the debtor, Dolores and\n17   Kaufman Group were parties to the turnover agreement, but Applied\n18   was not.    Two lists of transferred assets were attached to the\n19   turnover agreement, without any indication or division of\n20   respective ownership interests among the debtor, Dynamic and\n21   Electronic.    If the subject lists included any of the Qualtech\n22   Assets, to the extent Applied owned them, it was not a party, and\n23   the subject assets were not transferred, unless the debtor had a\n24   continuing ownership interest in them.19\n25        At the summary judgment hearing, the bankruptcy court\n26\n          19\n27          Nothing in the record indicates that any interest in the\n     Qualtech Assets ever was assigned or transferred from Applied to\n28   either Dynamic or Electronic.\n\n                                      33\n\f 1   highlighted certain language in the turnover agreement indicating\n 2   that the Business Assets belonged to the debtor.    The relevant\n 3   provision of the turnover agreement stated that the debtor\n 4   “continuously and irrevocably tender[ed] . . . all right, title\n 5   and interest and full possession of, in and to all its asset\n 6   collateral not [now] in [Dolores’] possession . . . .”    Such\n 7   language, the bankruptcy court reasoned, indicated that the\n 8   debtor owned the Business Assets collateral, lists of which were\n 9   attached to the turnover agreement.   Further, the bankruptcy\n10   court concluded that the turnover agreement was more “explicit,\n11   in terms of what it says,” than the loan resolution agreement.\n12   Tr. of Sept. 18, 2012 hr’g, 11:6-7.\n13        Dolores maintains that the actual transfer of the Business\n14   Assets occurred on March 31, 2008, more than a year before the\n15   debtor filed for bankruptcy protection.   Following the transfer\n16   on March 31, 2008, she asserts that she owned the Business\n17   Assets, which she then leased back to the debtor.    The debtor\n18   thus did not own the Business Assets during the preference\n19   period.\n20        As the bankruptcy court noted, if Dolores actually owned the\n21   Business Assets outside of the preference period, then it made no\n22   sense (or, as the bankruptcy court put it, was “illogical”) for\n23   Dolores to file the UCC-1 financing statement on May 27, 2009.\n24   Like the bankruptcy court, we too wonder if she truly owned the\n25   Business Assets during the preference period, “why on earth would\n26   [Dolores] file a UCC-1 in 2009, on her own property?”\n27        On the record before us and then before the bankruptcy\n28   court, there is no genuine issue that the debtor owned at least\n\n                                    34\n\f 1   some interest in the Business Assets during the insider\n 2   preference period.   However, even if the businesses owned some of\n 3   the Business Assets to an unspecified extent, as conceded by\n 4   Dolores’ counsel at oral argument, the debtor’s transfer of all\n 5   the Business Assets to Dolores drained the stock that he wholly\n 6   owned in the businesses of all value, thus constituting a\n 7   preferential transfer.\n 8        We ultimately conclude, as did the bankruptcy court, that\n 9   Dolores did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n10   whether the debtor had a property interest of some type either in\n11   or with respect to the transferred Business Assets for purposes\n12   of a determination of preferential transfer under § 547(b).\n13             b.   Preference period\n14        Dolores next argues that she provided evidence raising\n15   material factual issues as to whether the debtor transferred the\n16   Business Assets to her within one year prepetition.   She points\n17   to the loan resolution agreement, dated March 31, 2008, under\n18   which she allegedly took possession of the Business Assets.\n19   According to Dolores, the loan resolution agreement proves that\n20   the transfer occurred more than one year before the debtor filed\n21   for bankruptcy protection on July 15, 2009.\n22        We give no credence to this argument.    As noted above, and\n23   as the bankruptcy court reasoned at the partial summary judgment\n24   hearing, if Dolores truly owned the Business Assets before the\n25   preference period began, why would she file the UCC-1 financing\n26   statement on her property on May 27, 2009, and enter into the\n27   subsequent turnover agreement that transferred title and\n28   ownership of the Business Assets?    Such actions indicate that the\n\n                                     35\n\f 1   debtor had not yet transferred the Business Assets to Dolores\n 2   before the preference period began.    Also, the loan resolution\n 3   agreement does not mention foreclosure by Dolores on the Business\n 4   Assets, and no notice of the purported transfer was provided at\n 5   that time to any third parties.\n 6        We thus conclude that Dolores did not raise a genuine issue\n 7   of material fact as to whether the transfer occurred outside of\n 8   the preference period.\n 9              c.   Secured creditor status\n10        Dolores finally contends that she raised a genuine issue of\n11   material fact as to whether, as a secured creditor, she received\n12   more than she would have in a chapter 7 liquidation.    She points\n13   out that payments to a fully secured creditor are not\n14   preferential because such payments do not deplete the bankruptcy\n15   estate.   They do not diminish the value of the bankruptcy estate\n16   because, while funds are removed from the bankruptcy estate, the\n17   secured creditor’s lien is reduced in equal amount.\n18        Dolores claims that she submitted evidence showing that she\n19   was a fully secured creditor.   However, the uncontradicted\n20   evidence before the bankruptcy court established that her claimed\n21   security interests were unperfected until she filed the UCC-1\n22   financing statement on May 27, 2009 – well within the preference\n23   period.   Sheehan v. Valley Nat’l Bank (In re Shreves), 272 B.R.\n24   614, 622 (Bankr. N.D.W. Va. 2001)(“The trustee is granted the\n25   right under the Code to avoid transfers within the preference\n26   period, and the perfection of a lien within the preference period\n27   is a transfer avoidable by the trustee.”); Rouse v. Chase\n28   Manhattan Bank (In re Brown), 226 B.R. 39, 45 (W.D. Mo.\n\n                                       36\n\f 1   1998)(“The perfection of a lien within the preference period is\n 2   considered a transfer, which is avoidable by the trustee.”).\n 3        Dolores also presented evidence to raise questions as to\n 4   whether the Business Assets had a value that exceeded her secured\n 5   claim.    However, because her security interests were not\n 6   perfected until late in the preference period, such evidence was\n 7   ineffectual to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\n 8        Based on the foregoing, we determine that Dolores did not\n 9   present sufficient evidence to raise genuine factual issues as to\n10   the three contested elements for a preferential transfer under\n11   § 547(b).    We thus conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err\n12   in granting summary judgment on the § 547(b) claim.\n13   B.   Discharge Adversary\n14        According to their notice of appeal, Creditors appeal the\n15   new trial order.    But, in their appellate briefs, Creditors\n16   appear to be appealing both the § 523(a)(6) partial summary\n17   judgment order and the § 727(a)(2)(A) judgment.\n18        1.     Section 523(a)(6) claim\n19        Creditors contend that the bankruptcy court erred in\n20   refusing to except their debt from discharge under § 523(a)(6).\n21   They argue that they successfully established that the debtor\n22   intentionally and fraudulently transferred to Dolores the\n23   Business Assets because the bankruptcy court expressly found that\n24   he transferred the Business Assets to diminish his bankruptcy\n25   estate thereby defrauding his creditors.    Creditors maintain that\n26   the debtor’s intentional and fraudulent transfer constituted a\n27   “willful and malicious injury” within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n28        As noted above, the bankruptcy court granted summary\n\n                                      37\n\f 1   judgment in the debtor’s favor on Creditors’ § 523(a)(6) claim\n 2   for two reasons:    First, the § 523(a)(6) claim was not timely\n 3   filed.   Although the parties had stipulated to allow Creditors to\n 4   amend the Discharge Adversary complaint, there was no agreement\n 5   that the debtor could not assert an untimeliness defense to any\n 6   new claims that Creditors might assert in an amended complaint.\n 7   The deadline to file exception to discharge claims was\n 8   October 20, 2009.    The amended complaint asserting a § 523(a)(6)\n 9   claim for the first time was not filed until March 16, 2010.      The\n10   Creditors missed the deadline to assert their § 523(a)(6) claim.\n11   Rule 4007(c) provides that, “On motion of any party in interest\n12   after hearing on notice the court may for cause extend the time\n13   fixed under this subdivision.    The motion shall be filed before\n14   the time has expired.”    No such motion was filed by the Creditors\n15   to extend the deadline to file their § 523(a)(6) claim.     On this\n16   record, we perceive no error in the bankruptcy court dismissing\n17   the Creditors’ § 523(a)(6) claim as not timely filed.\n18        In addition, Creditors misapprehend § 523(a)(6).\n19   Section 523(a)(6) essentially encompasses intentional torts.\n20   Creditors’ claims arise out of breach of contract.    Under\n21   controlling Ninth Circuit case law, “‘a simple breach of contract\n22   is not the type of injury addressed by § 523(a)(6).’”    Petralia\n23   v. Jercich (In re Jercich), 238 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.\n24   2001)(quoting Snoke v. Riso (In re Riso), 978 F.2d 1151, 1154\n25   (9th Cir. 1992)).    The Ninth Circuit has held that “‘an\n26   intentional breach of contract is excepted from discharge under\n27   § 523(a)(6) only when it is accompanied by malicious and willful\n28   tortious conduct.’”    Jercich, 238 F.3d at 1205 (quoting Riso,\n\n                                      38\n\f 1   978 F.2d at 1154 (emphasis in original)).    Creditors only have\n 2   breach of contract claims with an after-the-fact argument that\n 3   the debtor’s alleged fraudulent transfer of the Business Assets\n 4   to Dolores constitutes a willful and malicious injury.    Their\n 5   embellished breach of contract claim does not support a willful\n 6   and malicious injury claim within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n 7   See Jercich, 238 F.3d at 1206.    We thus conclude that the\n 8   bankruptcy court did not err in determining, on an alternative\n 9   basis, that Creditors’ debt was not excepted from discharge under\n10   § 523(a)(6) due to a lack of evidence of the required subjective\n11   tortious intent.\n12        2.   Section 727(a)(2)(A) claim\n13        We now turn to Creditors’ appeal of the bankruptcy court’s\n14   determination on their § 727(a)(2)(A) claim.    Section\n15   727(a)(2)(A) provides that the bankruptcy court must deny the\n16   debtor’s discharge if the debtor, with intent to hinder, delay or\n17   defraud a creditor, transferred property of the debtor within one\n18   year prepetition.   Aubrey v. Thomas (In re Aubrey), 111 B.R. 268,\n19   273 (9th Cir. BAP 1990).   The creditor must demonstrate by a\n20   preponderance of evidence that:    1) the debtor transferred or\n21   concealed property; 2) the property belonged to the debtor;\n22   3) the transfer occurred within one year of his bankruptcy\n23   filing; and 4) the debtor made the transfer with the intent to\n24   hinder, delay or defraud a creditor.    Id. (citations omitted).\n25   The only element at issue on appeal is whether the Business\n26   Assets were property of the debtor.\n27        The bankruptcy court found in the Discharge Adversary that\n28   Creditors did not meet their burden of proof to establish that\n\n                                       39\n\f 1   the debtor owned the Business Assets for § 727(a)(2)(A) purposes.\n 2   The fact that the bankruptcy court concluded upon the more\n 3   extensive evidentiary record and legal arguments presented in the\n 4   Preference Adversary that a property interest of the debtor had\n 5   been transferred for preference purposes is not dispositive here.\n 6        Creditors argue that they established that the Business\n 7   Assets belonged to the debtor.   Creditors contend that the\n 8   businesses were the alter egos of the debtor.     Specifically, they\n 9   argue that:    1) the debtor jointly owned the Business Assets with\n10   the businesses; and 2) under California law, the shareholders of\n11   a dissolved corporation hold legal and equitable title to the\n12   dissolved corporation’s property, subject to the superior claims\n13   of its creditors.\n14        In determining whether alter ego liability applies, we must\n15   look to the law of the forum state.     Schwarzkopf, 626 F.3d at\n16   1037.   Here, California law applies.\n17        California recognizes alter ego liability:     1) “where ‘there\n18   is such a unity of interest and ownership that the individuality,\n19   or separateness, of the said person and corporation has ceased’”\n20   and 2) “where ‘adherence to the fiction of the separate existence\n21   of the corporation would . . . sanction a fraud or promote\n22   injustice.’”   Id. at 1038 (quoting Wood v. Elling Corp., 572 P.2d\n23   755, 761 n.9 (1977)).   This is a highly fact-intensive\n24   determination.   Factors suggesting an alter ego relationship\n25   include “‘[c]ommingling of funds and other assets [and] failure\n26   to segregate funds of the separate entities . . .; the treatment\n27   by an individual of the assets of the corporation as his own\n28   . . .; the disregard of legal formalities and the failure to\n\n                                      40\n\f 1   maintain arm’s length relationships among related entities . . .’\n 2   [and] the diversion [of assets from a corporation by or to a]\n 3   stockholder or other person or entity, to the detriment of\n 4   creditors, or the manipulation of assets . . . between entities\n 5   so as to concentrate the assets in one and the liabilities in\n 6   another.’”   Schwarzkopf, 626 F.3d at 1038 (quoting Associated\n 7   Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co., Inc., 26 Cal. Rptr. 806,\n 8   813-15 (1962)).\n 9        The bankruptcy court found that Creditors presented no\n10   evidence establishing that the businesses were the debtor’s alter\n11   egos, even though the joint pretrial order expressly listed this\n12   as an issue to be determined at trial.   We agree.\n13        Creditors also contend that upon dissolution of a\n14   corporation, its shareholders retain and own its assets.   But\n15   here, the dissolution of the businesses occurred after the\n16   Business Assets already had been transferred to Dolores.   By the\n17   time the businesses dissolved, they had no assets to distribute\n18   to the debtor.\n19        Based on our review of the record, we do not have a firm and\n20   definite conviction that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in\n21   finding that the Creditors had not met their burden of proof to\n22   establish that the Business Assets were the debtor’s property in\n23   the Discharge Adversary for purposes of their § 727(a)(2)(A)\n24   claim.\n25\n26                               CONCLUSION\n27        Both Dolores and Creditors contend on appeal that the\n28   bankruptcy court erred in its determinations in the adversary\n\n                                     41\n\f 1   proceedings.   Based on our review of the record, we conclude that\n 2   the bankruptcy court did not err.    Accordingly, we AFFIRM the\n 3   bankruptcy court’s rulings on appeal.\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                     42\n\f",

(“Kaufman\n15   Group”), and three of the debtor’s creditors, Jim Kerchner\n16   (“Kerchner”), Steve Root (“Root”) and Qualtech Backplanes, Inc.\n17   (“Qualtech”)(collectively, “Creditors”).\n18        The two appeals concern transfers of assets by the debtor to\n19   Dolores.    One of the appeals (BAP No. CC-13-1045) involves an\n20   adversary proceeding (AP No. 11-1026) initiated by the chapter 72\n21   trustee (“Trustee”) and Creditors (who joined as co-plaintiffs)\n22   against Dolores and Kaufman Group (together, “Dolores”) under\n23   §§ 547(b), 548(a) and 550 (“Preference Adversary”).

The Federal Rules of\n28   Civil Procedure are referred to as “Civil Rules.”\n\n                                       2\n\f 1   Creditors later moved for partial summary judgment on their\n 2   §§ 547(b) and 548(a)(1) claims against Dolores and Kaufman Group.\n 3   The bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment in favor of\n 4   Trustee and Creditors on their § 547(b) claim (“§ 547(b) partial\n 5   summary judgment order”).   Dolores appeals the bankruptcy court’s\n 6   grant of partial summary judgment.\n 7        The second appeal (BAP No. CC-13-1257) involves an adversary\n 8   proceeding (AP No. 09-1669) initiated by Creditors against the\n 9   debtor seeking to except their debt from discharge under\n10   § 523(a)(6) and to deny the debtor’s discharge under\n11   § 727(a)(2)(A)(“Discharge Adversary”).   There, the bankruptcy\n12   court ultimately ruled in the debtor’s favor on both claims.\n13   Creditors subsequently moved to set aside the findings or for a\n14   new trial (“motion for new trial”) under Civil Rules 52(a) and\n15   59(a)3 and Rules 9013-4(a)(2), (7) and (8) of the Local\n16   Bankruptcy Rules for the Central District of California.4    The\n17   bankruptcy court denied the motion for new trial (“new trial\n18   order”); the Creditors now appeal.   Creditors moreover appeal the\n19   bankruptcy court’s judgment in the debtor’s favor on their\n20   § 727(a)(2)(A) claim (“§ 727(a)(2)(A) judgment”).\n21        For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the § 547(b)\n22   partial summary judgment order, the new trial order to the extent\n23\n24        3\n            Civil Rule 52 is made applicable through Rule 7052.    Civil\n25   Rule 59 is made applicable through Rule 9023.\n26        4\n            Creditors did not specify in their motion for new trial\n27   the subsections of Civil Rules 52(a) and 59(a) that apply. Based\n     on our review of the record and briefs before us, we assume that\n28   Creditors intended Civil Rules 52(a)(6) and 59(a)(1)(B) to apply.\n\n                                      3\n\f 1   it dealt with Creditors’ § 523(a)(6) claim, and the\n 2   § 727(a)(2)(A) judgment.\n 3\n 4                                  FACTS\n 5   A.   Events prior to the debtor’s chapter 7 bankruptcy\n 6        Prepetition, the debtor wholly owned and operated Dynamic\n 7   Stamping, Inc. (“Dynamic”), Electronic Connector Service, Inc.\n 8   (“Electronic”), and Qualtech Applied Engineering Corp.\n 9   (“Applied”)(collectively, “businesses”).5   Dynamic, Electronic\n10   and Applied designed, made and/or assembled specialized\n11   electronic components.\n12        Kerchner and Root owned and operated Qualtech, a company\n13   that made and sold various electronic connectors.   It leased from\n14   Lapco Industrial Parks (“landlord”) its manufacturing and office\n15   facilities (“facility”) located in Santa Ana, California.\n16        On September 18, 2006, the debtor and Creditors entered into\n17   an asset purchase agreement (“Asset Purchase Agreement”) whereby\n18   Creditors sold Qualtech’s business to the debtor (“Qualtech\n19   sale”).   Specifically, under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the\n20   debtor purchased substantially all of Qualtech’s assets\n21   (“Qualtech Assets”)6 for $250,000 cash.\n22\n23        5\n            Applied formerly was known as Zip-Tron Corp. (“ZTC”). ZTC\n24   was incorporated in Nevada on May 1, 2000. It qualified to do\n     business in California on April 16, 2001. ZTC changed its name\n25   to “Qualtech Applied Engineering Corp.” on October 10, 2006.\n26        6\n            We use the term “Qualtech Assets” in the very limited and\n27   specific sense of the Qualtech assets sold in the Qualtech sale.\n     Assets of the debtor, Dynamic, Electronic and Applied, as\n28                                                         continue...\n\n                                      4\n\f 1        However, the debtor did not intend to own the Qualtech\n 2   Assets.   He expressed his intent in the Asset Purchase Agreement\n 3   to assign his rights and obligations under the Asset Purchase\n 4   Agreement to Applied.\n 5        Specifically, Article 2, Section 2.01 of the Asset Purchase\n 6   Agreement provided:\n 7        [The debtor] plans to assign his rights, and delegate\n          his obligations, under this [Asset Purchase Agreement],\n 8        to a legal entity to be formed. Such legal entity may\n          be a corporation or a limited liability company so long\n 9        as it is wholly owned and controlled by [the debtor].\n          In connection with such assignment and delegation, [the\n10        debtor] and such legal entity shall execute and deliver\n          an Assignment and Assumption Agreement [(“Assignment”)]\n11        . . . .\n12        The Assignment named Applied as the assignee.   Article 1,\n13   Section 1.01 of the Assignment provided:\n14        [The debtor] hereby assigns to [Applied] all of his\n          rights, and hereby delegates to [Applied] all of his\n15        duties, under the Asset Purchase Agreement. [Applied]\n          hereby accepts such assignment and delegation.\n16\n17   The Assignment further provided that Applied “will own and\n18   operate [Qualtech’s] Business after the [sale] Closing (as\n19   defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement).”   Qualtech consented to\n20   the assignment.7\n21\n22\n          6\n           ...continue\n23   relevant to this disposition, are referred to collectively as the\n24   “Business Assets.”\n          7\n25          We have taken some of the facts from a joint pretrial\n     order filed and entered on December 29, 2011, in the docket of\n26   AP No. 09-1669. We exercise our discretion to take judicial\n27   notice of documents electronically filed in the adversary\n     proceeding. See Atwood v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Co.\n28   (In re Atwood), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2014109\"><a href=\"/opinion/2014109/in-re-atwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233 n.9 (9th Cir. BAP 2003).\n\n                                      5\n\f 1        Although the debtor assigned to Applied all of his rights\n 2   and obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement, “[s]uch\n 3   assignment and delegation shall not act as a release of [the\n 4   debtor] and [he] shall remain legally responsible for the\n 5   performance of all of the obligations of Buyer (as defined in the\n 6   Asset Purchase Agreement) under the Asset Purchase Agreement.”\n 7        The debtor also entered into a sublease with Qualtech to\n 8   lease its facility (“sublease”), agreeing to pay all of the rent\n 9   for the facility.   He agreed to hold Qualtech harmless from any\n10   liability arising from any failure to perform under the sublease.\n11   The landlord consented to the sublease.\n12        The debtor further entered into separate consulting\n13   agreements with Root and Kerchner whereby they each agreed to\n14   provide consulting services relating to Applied’s business in\n15   exchange for consulting fees totaling $375,000 each.   The debtor\n16   was to pay the consulting fees in equal monthly installments over\n17   five years.\n18        Qualtech expressed its intent in the Asset Purchase\n19   Agreement to cease all business activities following the sale.\n20   However, Qualtech would continue to remain obligated as the\n21   master tenant for the facility.   Qualtech became inactive on\n22   April 1, 2008.   However, Qualtech later obtained a certificate of\n23   revivor effective August 23, 2010.\n24        For several years, the debtor operated the businesses out of\n25   the facility.    The debtor’s mother, Dolores, took care of various\n26   administrative matters for the businesses.   She also was an\n27   officer and director of the businesses.\n28        Dolores helped the debtor and the businesses in other ways\n\n                                       6\n\f 1   as well.    Under two separate loan agreements, both dated June 20,\n 2   2005,8 Dolores loaned the debtor and the businesses a total of\n 3   $250,000.   According to the debtor, he needed the funds “to close\n 4   out the deal with [Root] and [Kerchner].”   As noted above, the\n 5   purchase price for the Qualtech Assets under the Asset Purchase\n 6   Agreement was $250,000.\n 7        On November 1, 2006, Applied, Electronic and the debtor\n 8   obtained a $1 million loan from Vineyard Bank.   Vineyard Bank\n 9   filed UCC-1 financing statements perfecting its security\n10   interests in the assets of Applied and Electronic in November\n11   2006.\n12        Pursuant to the loan agreements, Dolores sent the debtor a\n13   written notice of demand, dated January 8, 2008 (“demand\n14   letter”), requiring the debtor to make full payment by March 15,\n15\n16        8\n            The debtor and Dolores entered into a loan agreement,\n17   dated June 20, 2005, wherein Dolores loaned the debtor $250,000,\n     payable within 60 days of Dolores providing a written notice of\n18   demand. The debtor personally guaranteed the loan, granting\n19   Dolores a security interest in “his assets and properties until\n     this Loan is paid in full.”\n20        The businesses (i.e., Dynamic, Electronic and Applied) and\n     Dolores entered into their own loan agreement, also dated\n21   June 20, 2005, wherein Dolores loaned the businesses $250,000,\n22   payable within 60 days of Dolores providing a written notice of\n     demand. The loan to the businesses was “secured by the following\n23   equipment (the Security): All current and future assets of the\n     [businesses].” The businesses granted Dolores a security\n24\n     interest in “the Security until this Loan is paid in full.” As\n25   president and CEO of the businesses, the debtor signed the loan\n     agreement on their behalf.\n26        Notably, the two loan agreements contained nearly identical\n27   provisions. The record reflects that the two loan agreements\n     encompassed a single $250,000 loan. Dolores did not file a UCC-1\n28   financing statement to perfect her security interest at the time.\n\n                                       7\n\f 1   2008.9    When the debtor failed to comply with the demand letter,\n 2   she sent another letter, dated March 26, 2008, advising him that\n 3   she was exercising her right under the loan agreements to\n 4   repossess the Business Assets.10\n 5        The debtor and Dolores thereafter entered into a loan\n 6   resolution agreement, dated March 31, 2008.    Under the loan\n 7   resolution agreement, Dolores was to take immediate possession of\n 8   her collateral.11   No mention was made in the loan resolution\n 9   agreement of Dolores foreclosing her security interest in the\n10   Business Assets.    The loan resolution agreement further does not\n11   provide for any transfer of title or ownership of the Business\n12   Assets, and the Business Assets apparently remained in place.\n13   Dolores agreed to lease the equipment to the debtor on certain\n14   conditions, including:    1) Dolores making payments on the\n15\n          9\n16          In the demand letter, Dolores stated that she had made a\n     $250,000 loan to Dynamic. She listed both the debtor and Dynamic\n17   as addressees. However, she addressed the debtor directly and\n     sought repayment from him.\n18\n          10\n19          In the March 26, 2008 letter, Dolores advised the debtor\n     that she was going to “exercise her rights under section 6 of the\n20   agreement and take possession of the security items defined in\n     our agreement.” Dolores also stated that she was “disappointed\n21\n     that [the debtor] did not comply with her request of January 8,\n22   2008 for repayment of the $250,000 [she] loaned [the debtor] on\n     June 20, 2005.”\n23        In the March 26, 2008 letter, Dolores addressed the debtor\n24   directly (i.e., as the recipient). As in the demand letter, she\n     also listed both the debtor and Dynamic as the addressees.\n25\n          11\n            The loan resolution agreement stated that it was between\n26   the debtor and Dolores. It also stated that “[i]n exchange for\n27   the option to use this equipment, [Dolores would] lease use of it\n     to [the debtor] . . . .” The debtor did not list any equipment\n28   among his personal property assets on Schedule B.\n\n                                        8\n\f 1   debtor’s line of credit; and 2) the debtor paying Dolores $6,000\n 2   per month, starting in April 2009.\n 3        In a letter dated June 19, 2008, Dolores informed the debtor\n 4   that she was “unhappy” with the “direction and results of the\n 5   company.”   She advised him that she was “exercising her right to\n 6   demand payment in full of $165,000.”   However, to make repayment\n 7   easier for him, Dolores declined to collect interest on the loan.\n 8   She purportedly obtained a lien securing future repayment of the\n 9   loan, recognizing that “the current economic conditions of the\n10   company” made immediate repayment difficult.   There is no\n11   evidence in the record that Dolores took any action to have the\n12   “lien” attach or to perfect it; she only referenced the lien in\n13   her letter.\n14        Thereafter, on January 1, 2009, Applied defaulted under the\n15   lease by failing to pay the rent for the facility.    After\n16   notifying Applied and the debtor of the default, the landlord\n17   initiated an unlawful detainer action against Creditors, Applied\n18   and the debtor.   On March 23, 2009, the landlord obtained a\n19   $205,470.84 judgment against Creditors for past due rent and\n20   rental value damages and attorney’s fees and costs (“landlord\n21   judgment”).\n22        Contributing to the flurry of collection activity against\n23   the debtor and the businesses, Dolores sent the debtor a letter,\n24   dated April 30, 2009 (“breach of contract letter”).    In the\n25   breach of contract letter, Dolores notified the debtor that she\n26   would take immediate possession of all of Dynamic’s equipment,\n27   tools, etc., as the debtor had failed to make the monthly loan\n28   payments in breach of the loan agreement.   Again, apparently all\n\n                                      9\n\f 1   of the Business Assets remained in place.\n 2        Due to the landlord judgment against them, on May 8, 2009,\n 3   Creditors initiated a state court action against the debtor and\n 4   Applied for breach of the sublease, declaratory relief as to the\n 5   right of indemnity from Applied and the debtor on the landlord\n 6   judgment and breach of guaranty against the debtor (“state court\n 7   action”).\n 8        On June 8, 2009, the debtor and Dolores entered into a\n 9   “voluntary foreclosure and repossession agreement” (“turnover\n10   agreement”).   Under the turnover agreement, Dolores took all of\n11   the debtor’s right, title and interest in and possession of the\n12   Business Assets, which included Dynamic’s and Electronic’s\n13   machines, tools and equipment.   Specifically, the turnover\n14   agreement provided:\n15        [The debtor] hereby continuously and irrevocably\n          tenders to [Dolores] without need of judicial\n16        proceedings, all right, title and interest, and full\n          possession of, in and to all of its Asset Collateral,\n17        which [the debtor] now owns or will own as a result of\n          the daily operation of its business. All such Asset\n18        Collateral not now in [Dolores’] possession shall be\n          deemed received and held by [the debtor] in trust for\n19        and subject to the sole discretion of [Dolores] until\n          [her] acceptance of such tender of possession.\n20\n21   Notably, the turnover agreement included a list of various\n22   machines and a list of equipment.     Applied was not a party to the\n23   turnover agreement.\n24        At the time she entered into the turnover agreement, Dolores\n25   was doing business as Kaufman Group.    She soon transferred the\n26   Business Assets acquired under the turnover agreement to Kaufman\n27   Group.   Using the Business Assets, Dolores began operating out of\n28   the facility, making and selling the same products previously\n\n                                      10\n\f 1   made and sold by the businesses.\n 2        Dynamic filed a certificate of dissolution with the\n 3   California Secretary of State on June 22, 2009.    Electronic and\n 4   Applied filed certificates of dissolution with the California\n 5   Secretary of State on July 10, 2009.\n 6   B.   The debtor’s chapter 7 bankruptcy and adversary proceedings\n 7        On July 15, 2009, the debtor filed his chapter 7 bankruptcy\n 8   petition.    He listed his interests in Applied, Electronic and\n 9   Dynamic on Schedule B, but noted that they were no longer in\n10   business.    He did not list any of the Business Assets as his own.\n11   The debtor named Applied, Electronic and Dynamic as co-debtors on\n12   his Schedule H.    He listed Dolores on Schedule F with a $250,000\n13   general unsecured claim based on business debt.\n14        The debtor also scheduled Kerchner and Root with general\n15   unsecured claims each in the amount of $605,000, both based on\n16   business debts.    He also listed Vineyard Bank with a $1,165,000\n17   general unsecured claim based on trade debt.    Two months after\n18   the initial § 341(a) meeting, Trustee filed a no asset report on\n19   October 7, 2009.12\n20        1.     Preference Adversary\n21        On January 1, 2011, Trustee and Creditors filed a complaint\n22   against Dolores (AP No. 11-1026) under §§ 547, 548, 550 and 551\n23   to commence the Preference Adversary.\n24        In their complaint, Trustee and Creditors highlighted the\n25   lack of documentation for the following in their allegations:\n26   1) attachment and perfection of Dolores’ security interests and\n27\n          12\n28             The debtor received his discharge on March 25, 2013.\n\n                                        11\n\f 1   liens in the Business Assets; 2) the provision of the loan funds\n 2   to the debtor and the businesses; 3) the transfer of the Qualtech\n 3   Assets to Applied; and 4) the repossession of the Business Assets\n 4   by Dolores.   They also pointed out that the debtor, the\n 5   businesses and/or Dolores did not provide any third party notice\n 6   of the transfer of the Business Assets to Dolores.\n 7        Trustee and Creditors further alleged that there was such a\n 8   unity of interest between the debtor and Dolores and the\n 9   businesses, the businesses were their alter egos.    They cited\n10   numerous examples in support, including allegations that:\n11   1) funds were moved between the businesses without regard to the\n12   source or obligations; 2) the businesses had the same officers\n13   and directors (i.e., the debtor and Dolores); 3) Kaufman Group\n14   continued to use the trade names of Applied and Electronic and to\n15   service the same customers; and 4) the debtor received\n16   compensation (in the form of payment for his rent and the use of\n17   a Mercedes Benz for his wife) for providing consultation services\n18   to Kaufman Group.\n19        They also pointed out that the debtor scheduled Dolores as a\n20   general unsecured creditor, even though she took possession of\n21   the Business Assets prepetition and supposedly had a valid\n22   security interest in them.   Moreover, even though the debtor\n23   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores as a form of payment\n24   on the $250,000 loan, he did not characterize the transfer in his\n25   bankruptcy schedules as a credit against the debt owed to\n26   Dolores.\n27        Given these facts, Trustee and Creditors argued that the\n28   debtor and Dolores fraudulently transferred the Business Assets\n\n                                     12\n\f 1   to Dolores through their alter egos in order to thwart Creditors’\n 2   attempts to obtain judgment against the debtor, and to continue\n 3   the operations of the businesses.\n 4        Seven months after Dolores filed her answer, Trustee and\n 5   Creditors moved for partial summary judgment against them on the\n 6   §§ 547(b) and 548(a)(1) claims (“partial summary judgment\n 7   motion”).\n 8        With respect to their § 547(b) claim, Trustee and Creditors\n 9   averred that they met all of the elements for establishing an\n10   avoidable preferential transfer.       They focused on one element in\n11   particular: the Business Assets as property of the debtor and/or\n12   the bankruptcy estate.\n13        Trustee and Creditors contended that because the debtor\n14   wholly owned the businesses, they became assets of the bankruptcy\n15   estate when he filed for bankruptcy.      Under Cal. Corp. Code\n16   § 2004, corporate assets are distributed to shareholders upon\n17   dissolution of the corporation.    Here, had the debtor not\n18   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores, they would have been\n19   distributed to him as the sole shareholder.      The Business Assets\n20   then would have become part of the bankruptcy estate when he\n21   filed for bankruptcy.\n22        Alternatively, Trustee and Creditors claimed that the debtor\n23   owned the Qualtech Assets, not Applied.      He never produced\n24   documents showing that he transferred the Qualtech Assets to\n25   Applied pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and Assignment.\n26   Moreover, he treated the Business Assets as his personal assets\n27   when he pledged them as security on the personal loan.\n28        Trustee and Creditors further argued that the debtor\n\n                                       13\n\f 1   actually owned the Business Assets because the businesses were\n 2   his alter egos.   Under California law, although a corporation\n 3   typically is an entity separate and distinct from its\n 4   stockholders, it is considered an individual’s alter ego when\n 5   there is such a unity of interest between the individual and the\n 6   corporation as to negate the corporation’s separateness.   In\n 7   other words, the corporation is considered the individual’s alter\n 8   ego when he uses it for convenience to transact his business in\n 9   such a way that amounts to fraud or injustice against third\n10   parties.\n11        Here, the debtor admitted at the § 341(a) meeting that he\n12   moved funds between the businesses without regard to the source\n13   or obligations, even though he maintained separate bank accounts.\n14   Also, the debtor was the sole shareholder of the businesses.     He\n15   and Dolores were the only officers and directors of the\n16   businesses.\n17        As for the § 548(a)(1) claim, Trustee and Creditors\n18   contended that the debtor received less than reasonably\n19   equivalent value in exchange for the transfer of the Business\n20   Assets to Dolores.   Specifically, although he owed Dolores only\n21   $250,000, he transferred all of the Business Assets, which were\n22   worth more than $560,000.\n23        They also argued that, based on circumstances surrounding\n24   the transfers, the debtor had actual intent to hinder, delay or\n25   defraud creditors when he transferred the Business Assets to\n26   Dolores.   Several badges of fraud existed, demonstrating the\n27   debtor’s fraudulent intent, including:   1) as an officer and\n28   director of the businesses, Dolores was an insider; 2) the debtor\n\n                                     14\n\f 1   concealed the transfer by failing to provide public notice to\n 2   creditors and by failing to comply with California bulk sales\n 3   law; 3) the debtor transferred the Business Assets to Dolores\n 4   less than a month after being served with Creditors’ state court\n 5   complaint; and 4) the debtor became insolvent after he\n 6   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores.\n 7        Dolores opposed the partial summary judgment motion\n 8   asserting that Trustee and Creditors failed to show that no\n 9   material factual issues existed as to their §§ 547(b) and 548(a)\n10   claims.\n11        With respect to the § 547(b) claim, Dolores contended that\n12   Trustee and Creditors could not show that no material factual\n13   issue existed as to whether the transfer involved property of the\n14   debtor.   She claimed that evidence showed that the debtor never\n15   personally owned the Business Assets.   Under the Asset Purchase\n16   Agreement, Applied was the intended purchaser of the Qualtech\n17   Assets.   The debtor simply was the placeholder, holding the\n18   Qualtech Assets until Applied could be established.   The\n19   Assignment further supports this intent.\n20        Also, the Business Assets did not belong to the debtor\n21   because Dolores took possession of the Business Assets on\n22   March 31, 2008, then leased them back to the debtor and the\n23   businesses.   Neither the debtor nor the businesses owned the\n24   Business Assets after March 31, 2008; they simply were leasing\n25   them.   In other words, they held a leasehold interest in the\n26   Business Assets only, similar to holding the Business Assets in\n27   trust for Dolores.\n28        Moreover, the transfer of the Business Assets to Dolores\n\n                                     15\n\f 1   occurred outside of the statutory preference period under\n 2   § 547(b).   Section 547(b)(4)(B) requires that the transfer take\n 3   place up to one year prepetition.     Here, Dolores took possession\n 4   of the Business Assets on March 31, 2008.\n 5        She also disputed Trustee and Creditors’ allegation that the\n 6   businesses were her and the debtor’s alter egos.    Each of the\n 7   businesses filed its own tax returns, conducted separate\n 8   operations and maintained separate books and records.    Funds were\n 9   transferred between the businesses because goods and services\n10   were exchanged between them.    Further, Dolores made loans to each\n11   of the businesses and the debtor separately.    The debtor did not\n12   use all of the loans for his personal benefit.    Additionally,\n13   Dolores was not paying the debtor a consulting fee; she simply\n14   was helping his family with its expenses.\n15        Dolores further argued that Trustee and Creditors failed to\n16   show that no material factual issue existed as to whether Dolores\n17   received more than she would have under a chapter 7 liquidation.\n18   She was a secured creditor who was entitled to repayment of the\n19   entire loan.    Payment to a fully secured creditor is not\n20   preferential because it does not deplete the bankruptcy estate as\n21   such payment reduces the secured creditor’s lien in an equal\n22   amount.\n23        Dolores also raised the new value defense under § 547(c)(1),\n24   claiming that she and the debtor intended that the transfer of\n25   the Business Assets be a contemporaneous exchange for new value\n26   given to him.\n27        The bankruptcy court held a hearing on the partial summary\n28   judgment motion on September 18, 2012.    It concluded that the\n\n                                      16\n\f 1   debtor’s ownership interests in the businesses constituted\n 2   property of the estate within the meaning of § 541.    The\n 3   bankruptcy court referenced the loan agreements, the loan\n 4   resolution agreement and the turnover agreement.     It pointed out\n 5   that all of these agreements had been between the debtor and\n 6   Dolores.    The bankruptcy court acknowledged that\n 7        [S]ome other entities that [the debtor] controlled also\n          had an interest in all those assets. But it [was]\n 8        pretty clear that – you look at the agreements between\n          Dolores Stout and Edward Stout, and the reference to\n 9        the assets is the reference to him. It’s only to him\n          individually, in the body of the actual document.\n10\n11   Tr. of Sept. 18, 2012 hr’g, 6:7-12.\n12        The bankruptcy court also determined that the perfection of\n13   Dolores’s security interests, through the filing of a UCC-1\n14   financing statement on May 27, 2009, was within the preference\n15   period.    At the summary judgment hearing, the bankruptcy court\n16   wondered, “[i]f [Dolores] was the owner of the property, why on\n17   earth would she file a UCC-1 in 2009, on her own property?”\n18   Tr. of Sept. 18, 2012 h’rg, 2:22-25.    It also noted that Dolores\n19   took further steps to perfect her security interest by executing\n20   the turnover agreement, which allowed her to take possession of\n21   the Business Assets immediately.\n22        The bankruptcy court also concluded that Dolores was an\n23   insider within the meaning of § 101(31) as she was the debtor’s\n24   mother.    Consequently, the one-year reach back period of\n25   § 547(b)(4)(B) applied.    It thus granted summary judgment on the\n26   § 547(b) claim, concluding that no genuine triable factual issues\n27   existed as to that claim.\n28        The bankruptcy court denied summary judgment on the\n\n                                      17\n\f 1   § 548(a)(1) claim.    It found that triable issues of material fact\n 2   existed as to the § 548(a)(1) claim.13\n 3        On January 23, 2013, the bankruptcy court entered the\n 4   § 547(b) partial summary judgment order in favor of Creditors.\n 5   Dolores timely appealed the § 547(b) partial summary judgment\n 6   order.    The bankruptcy court entered a Rule 54(b) certification\n 7   thereafter.\n 8        2.     Discharge Adversary\n 9        On October 20, 2009, before the Preference Adversary was\n10   filed, Creditors filed a complaint (“Discharge Complaint”)\n11   against the debtor, initially asserting a claim under\n12   § 727(a)(2)(A) only.    Under a stipulation entered February 9,\n13   2010, the debtor agreed to allow Creditors to amend their\n14   complaint to include a claim under § 523(a)(6).    AP No. 09-1669\n15   Docket Nos. 9 and 10.    Creditors filed their amended complaint on\n16   March 16, 2010, including a claim under § 523(a)(6).\n17        With respect to their § 523(a)(6) claim, Creditors asserted\n18   that the businesses were the debtor’s alter egos.    They then\n19   alleged that the debtor “conspired” with Dolores “to thwart” the\n20   pending state court action and to hinder, delay and defraud them\n21   by fraudulently transferring the Business Assets to Dolores\n22   and/or Kaufman Group.    Finally, they alleged that such acts\n23   willfully and maliciously injured Creditors.\n24        Alternatively, they argued that the debtor’s discharge\n25   should be denied under § 727(a)(2)(A) because, within one year\n26\n          13\n27          Since disposition of the § 548(a)(1) claim has no\n     relevance to the disposition in this appeal, we will not refer to\n28   it further herein.\n\n                                       18\n\f 1   prior to filing for bankruptcy, he transferred the Business\n 2   Assets to Dolores and/or Kaufman Group with the intent to prevent\n 3   Creditors from obtaining and collecting a judgment against him in\n 4   the state court action.\n 5        Several months after he filed his answer to the Discharge\n 6   Complaint, the debtor moved for summary judgment (“debtor summary\n 7   judgment motion”), asserting that Creditors failed to establish\n 8   the elements of their § 727(a)(2)(A) and § 523(a)(6) claims.\n 9        With respect to the § 727(a)(2)(A) claim, the debtor argued\n10   that he never owned the Qualtech Assets at any time.    At the time\n11   of the Qualtech sale, the debtor merely held the Qualtech Assets\n12   for Applied.14    The Asset Purchase Agreement specifically\n13   contemplated that a business entity would be the “true” purchaser\n14   of the Qualtech Assets; the debtor simply was a placeholder.\n15   Moreover, Applied owned the Qualtech Assets until March 2008,\n16   when Dolores allegedly foreclosed on the Business Assets.\n17   Because the debtor never truly owned the Qualtech Assets, there\n18   could not have been a transfer within the meaning of\n19   § 727(a)(2)(A).\n20        He also maintained that the businesses never were his alter\n21   egos.     The businesses filed their own tax returns and maintained\n22   separate books and records.    They also maintained separate bank\n23   accounts; they did not commingle any funds with the debtor.\n24        The debtor further contended that the transfer of the\n25   Business Assets to Dolores occurred outside the one-year period\n26\n          14\n27           The debtor advanced a number of arguments in his summary\n     judgment motion, but we focus only on those relevant to the\n28   appeal.\n\n                                       19\n\f 1   under § 727(a)(2)(A).   Although Dolores did not file her UCC-1\n 2   financing statement until May 27, 2009, the debtor alleged that\n 3   she had a perfected security interest.   The transfers of the\n 4   Business Assets to Dolores through the attachment of her security\n 5   interest became effective on June 20, 2005 when she signed the\n 6   loan agreements.\n 7        He also contended that Creditors failed to show that he had\n 8   actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud them at the time he\n 9   transferred the Business Assets to Dolores.   She had a valid\n10   security interest in the Business Assets pursuant to the loan\n11   agreements.   Dolores acquired the Business Assets because the\n12   debtor failed to repay his debt to her, not because the debtor\n13   intended to prevent Creditors from obtaining a state court\n14   judgment against him.\n15        As to the § 523(a)(6) claim,15 the debtor argued that\n16   Creditors failed to show that he had a subjective intent to\n17   injure them when he transferred the Business Assets to Dolores.\n18   She had a valid security interest in the Business Assets; Dolores\n19\n20\n          15\n            The debtor also argued that Creditors could not assert\n21   their § 523(a)(6) claim because it was time-barred under\n22   Rule 4007(c).\n          Rule 4007(c) provides that the deadline to file a complaint\n23   to except a debt from discharge, including under § 523(a)(6), is\n     60 days after the first date set for the § 341(a) meeting of\n24\n     creditors. The initial § 341(a) meeting of creditors in the\n25   debtor’s bankruptcy case was scheduled for August 21, 2009.\n     According to Form B9A, the “Notice of Commencement of Case under\n26   the Bankruptcy Code, Meeting of Creditors and Deadlines,” that\n27   was filed and entered on July 20, 2009 in the debtor’s bankruptcy\n     case (main case docket no. 3), the deadline to file\n28   dischargeability complaints was October 20, 2009.\n\n                                     20\n\f 1   simply exercised her right to repossess them pursuant to the loan\n 2   agreements.\n 3        He also argued that the debt owed to Creditors arose out of\n 4   a breach of contract, which is not recognized as a debt excepted\n 5   from discharge under any of the provisions of § 523(a).\n 6        The debtor further sought to dismiss Qualtech as a\n 7   plaintiff.    When Creditors filed the Discharge Complaint,\n 8   Qualtech was suspended for failing to pay taxes.    Qualtech\n 9   therefore lacked the capacity to commence and prosecute the\n10   Discharge Adversary against him.\n11        Creditors filed an opposition to the debtor’s summary\n12   judgment motion.    They opposed it on procedural grounds only,\n13   contending that the debtor filed his summary judgment motion\n14   untimely.    They also argued that notice of the hearing on the\n15   summary judgment motion was defective as the notice was served\n16   untimely.\n17        Before the December 16, 2010 hearing on the summary judgment\n18   motion,16 the bankruptcy court issued a tentative ruling.      In its\n19   tentative ruling, the bankruptcy court indicated an intent to\n20   grant the debtor’s summary judgment motion as to the § 523(a)(6)\n21   claim, but to deny the summary judgment motion as to the\n22   § 727(a)(2)(A) claim.    At the summary judgment hearing, the\n23   bankruptcy court adopted its tentative ruling.\n24\n25\n          16\n            Within the Central District of California, a hearing\n26   automatically is scheduled on a motion for summary judgment,\n27   whether or not an opposition is filed. See Rule 7056-1(a) and\n     Rule 9013-1(a)(5) of the Local Bankruptcy Rules for the\n28   Bankruptcy Court of the Central District of California.\n\n                                      21\n\f 1        On March 21, 2011, the bankruptcy court entered the\n 2   § 523(a)(6) partial summary judgment order.   It granted summary\n 3   judgment in the debtor’s favor as to the § 523(a)(6) claim on two\n 4   grounds:   first, concluding that the § 523(a)(6) claim was not\n 5   timely filed and, further, determining that Creditors did not\n 6   raise any material factual issue concerning the debtor’s intent\n 7   to cause injury within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n 8        The bankruptcy court denied summary judgment on the\n 9   § 727(a)(2)(A) claim, determining that genuine material factual\n10   issues existed as to the following:   1) the significance and\n11   legal effect of the transfer of the Qualtech Assets to Applied;\n12   2) the existence of alter ego; 3) the circumstances concerning\n13   Dolores’ taking possession of the Business Assets; and 4) the\n14   debtor’s intent to hinder, delay or defraud Creditors.\n15        The bankruptcy court further determined that there was\n16   insufficient admissible evidence as to Qualtech’s legal status as\n17   of the filing of the Discharge Complaint.   It also determined\n18   that the debtor failed to address the issue involving Qualtech’s\n19   certificate of revivor.\n20        The remaining claim in the Discharge Complaint proceeded to\n21   trial.   In preparation for the trial, the debtor and Creditors\n22   submitted a joint pretrial order.\n23        In the joint pretrial order, they agreed and admitted to\n24   several facts, including that:   1) the debtor wholly owned and\n25   controlled the businesses by June 20, 2005; 2) Dolores was an\n26   officer and director of the businesses by June 20, 2005; 3) the\n27   debtor and the businesses entered into the loan agreements with\n28   Dolores; 4) the debtor or his allowed assignee was the purchaser\n\n                                      22\n\f 1   under the Asset Purchase Agreement; 5) the debtor personally\n 2   guaranteed performance under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the\n 3   sublease and the consulting agreements; 6) Dolores took\n 4   possession of the Business Assets two months before the debtor\n 5   filed his chapter 7 petition; and 7) Qualtech was under\n 6   suspension from April 1, 2008 until August 23, 2010, when it\n 7   filed its certificate of revivor.\n 8        The debtor and Creditors also listed several factual issues\n 9   remaining to be litigated, including:   1) whether the debtor was\n10   the alter ego of the businesses; 2) whether the debtor acted to\n11   transfer, conceal, destroy or remove the Business Assets; and\n12   3) whether the debtor had actual intent to defraud, delay or\n13   hinder Creditors through his actions within one year prepetition.\n14        Before the trial, the bankruptcy court addressed several\n15   pretrial motions filed by the debtor.   In one pretrial motion,\n16   the debtor again sought to dismiss Qualtech as a plaintiff for\n17   lack of standing to prosecute the Discharge Complaint (“pretrial\n18   motion”).   AP No. 09-1669 Docket No. 82.   Following a hearing,\n19   the bankruptcy court granted the pretrial motion, entering the\n20   order on May 15, 2012.   AP No. 09-1669 Docket No. 138.   It\n21   concluded that Qualtech lacked capacity to prosecute the\n22   Discharge Adversary because at the time it was filed on\n23   October 20, 2009, Qualtech was under suspension.\n24        The bankruptcy court held a four-day trial.    It issued its\n25   ruling orally on March 1, 2013 (“Trial Findings Hearing”).\n26        At the outset of the Trial Findings Hearing, the bankruptcy\n27   court stressed that it reviewed all admissible evidence\n28   independent from any other pending adversary proceeding, i.e.,\n\n                                     23\n\f 1   the Preference Adversary.   It then went on to state that\n 2   Creditors had established all but one of the elements of\n 3   § 727(a)(2)(A).\n 4        It found that the debtor transferred all of the Business\n 5   Assets to Dolores within one year of his bankruptcy filing with\n 6   the actual intent to hinder, delay and defraud Creditors.   The\n 7   bankruptcy court noted that the evidence showed that the transfer\n 8   of the Business Assets to Dolores “was designed to ensure\n 9   protection of [her] interest as a creditor to the detriment of\n10   [Creditors].”   Tr. of March 1, 2013 hr’g, 6:7-8.\n11        It inferred that the debtor had fraudulent intent in\n12   transferring the Business Assets to Dolores based on the\n13   circumstances surrounding the transfer.   The bankruptcy court\n14   pointed out that Dolores had a close relationship with the debtor\n15   because she was his mother.   It also noted that the debtor made\n16   the transfer very shortly after Creditors initiated the state\n17   court action.   The bankruptcy court further pointed out that the\n18   debtor transferred substantially all of the Business Assets to\n19   Dolores which left “other creditors with little from which to\n20   recover on their claims.”   Tr. of March 1, 2013 hr’g, 6:23-24.\n21        However, it found that Creditors failed to show that the\n22   Business Assets were the property of the debtor.    The bankruptcy\n23   court noted that Creditors seemed to rely on its earlier\n24   determination in the Preference Adversary.   There, in its partial\n25   summary judgment order entered January 23, 2013, the bankruptcy\n26   court had found that the debtor’s transfer of the Business Assets\n27   to Dolores under the turnover agreement constituted a\n28   preferential transfer under § 547(b).   It explained to Creditors\n\n                                     24\n\f 1   that its holding in the Preference Adversary had “no bearing on\n 2   [its] ruling in this matter” because:   1) the debtor was not a\n 3   party to the Preference Adversary so he could not raise a defense\n 4   or submit evidence and legal argument regarding the property\n 5   transfer’s characterization; 2) the evidence and legal arguments\n 6   presented in the Preference Adversary “were far more extensive\n 7   and compelling” than the Creditors’ presentation in the Discharge\n 8   Adversary; 3) Creditors provided no evidence showing that the\n 9   debtor was the alter ego of the businesses, even though a joint\n10   pretrial order had listed this as an issue to be determined at\n11   trial.   Tr. of March 1, 2013 hr’g, 7:10-25, 8:1-18.   See\n12   Discussion infra.   The bankruptcy court concluded that, “absent a\n13   finding of alter ego, property belonging to a debtor’s wholly-\n14   owned corporation is property of that entity and not property of\n15   the debtor within the meaning of 727(a)(2).”   Tr. of March 1,\n16   2013 hr’g, 10:8-11.\n17        On March 25, 2013, the bankruptcy court entered judgment in\n18   favor of the debtor on the § 727(a)(2)(A) claim (“§ 727(a)(2)\n19   judgment”).   Two weeks later, Creditors filed the motion for new\n20   trial.\n21        They contended that they established all of the elements of\n22   § 727(a)(2)(A).   In particular, Creditors averred that the\n23   Business Assets were property of the estate within the meaning of\n24   § 727(a)(2)(A).   Under California law, when a corporation is\n25   dissolved, all of its assets automatically are transferred to its\n26   shareholders.   When an individual files for bankruptcy, the\n27   chapter 7 trustee acquires all of his rights and interests in\n28   property.   Any property belonging to the debtor thus becomes part\n\n                                     25\n\f 1   of the bankruptcy estate.\n 2        Here, the debtor owned all of the stock in the businesses.\n 3   When the debtor dissolved the businesses shortly before he filed\n 4   his bankruptcy petition, all of their assets went to the\n 5   businesses’ shareholder – i.e., the debtor.   When he filed for\n 6   bankruptcy, Trustee succeeded to the debtor’s rights and\n 7   interests, including his ownership interest in the Business\n 8   Assets.   The Business Assets thus became part of the bankruptcy\n 9   estate.\n10        Creditors further argued that, under § 727(a)(7), a debtor’s\n11   discharge shall be denied if he is an insider of a corporation\n12   and had fraudulently transferred the corporation’s assets within\n13   the meaning of § 727(a)(2).   Here, the debtor was an officer and\n14   director and sole shareholder of the businesses, which qualified\n15   him as an insider.   Because he fraudulently transferred the\n16   Business Assets to Dolores when he was an insider of the\n17   businesses, his discharge must be denied.\n18        Creditors also maintained that the businesses were the\n19   debtor’s alter egos under California law.   In California, a\n20   person is the alter ego of his corporation if:   1) he owns all of\n21   the corporation’s stock; 2) there is such a unity of interest and\n22   ownership that the separateness of the person and the corporation\n23   has ceased; and 3) an adherence to the fiction of the separate\n24   existence of the corporation would sanction a fraud or promote\n25   injustice.   Here, Creditors averred, all three elements of alter\n26   ego were met:   1) the debtor wholly owned and controlled the\n27   businesses; 2) the debtor admitted at the § 341(a) meeting that\n28   he co-owned with the businesses the Business Assets and\n\n                                     26\n\f 1   commingled his personal assets in the Business Assets in such a\n 2   way that he could not separate them; and 3) adhering to the\n 3   fiction of the separate existence of the businesses would condone\n 4   fraud and promote injustice.\n 5        Creditors further asked the bankruptcy court to reconsider\n 6   its grant of partial summary judgment on the § 523(a)(6) claim.\n 7   Creditors contended that the facts proven at trial showed that\n 8   the debtor intended “to strip the value” from his corporate stock\n 9   by transferring the sale assets to Dolores, an insider.   In doing\n10   so, the debtor caused Creditors willful and malicious injury\n11   within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n12        Following a hearing on May 7, 2013 (“new trial hearing”),\n13   the bankruptcy court denied the motion for new trial.   It noted\n14   that Creditors did not provide any substantive analysis as to how\n15   Civil Rules 52 and 59 and Local Rule 9013-4(a) applied.\n16        The bankruptcy court determined that Creditors misapplied\n17   § 727(a)(7).   It explained that § 727(a)(7) ties together related\n18   cases so that misconduct in one case by an individual may be\n19   chargeable against him in other related cases.   Here, the\n20   businesses never filed for bankruptcy; they were nonbankruptcy\n21   insiders.\n22        Moreover, the bankruptcy court reasoned, even if § 727(a)(7)\n23   applied to nonbankruptcy insiders such as the businesses,\n24   Creditors never included their § 727(a)(7) claim in the joint\n25   pretrial order as a claim to be litigated.\n26        As for their arguments regarding alter ego, the bankruptcy\n27   court found that Creditors failed to address the lack of evidence\n28   of alter ego at trial.   They also failed to proffer appropriate\n\n                                     27\n\f 1   analysis of alter ego under Civil Rules 59 and 52.\n 2        The bankruptcy court further found unpersuasive Creditors’\n 3   argument that the debtor’s dissolution of the businesses shortly\n 4   before his bankruptcy filing required the denial of his\n 5   discharge.   It pointed out that Creditors failed to provide any\n 6   analysis as to how the assets of the debtor’s dissolved\n 7   businesses (if any at the times that the businesses were\n 8   dissolved) legally reverted to the debtor, as shareholder,\n 9   prepetition.\n10        The bankruptcy court denied Creditors’ request to reconsider\n11   its grant of partial summary judgment on their § 523(a)(6) claim\n12   because they failed to present any grounds for reconsideration.\n13   It moreover mentioned that Creditors were seeking reconsideration\n14   of an order that it issued more than two years before.\n15        On May 15, 2013, the bankruptcy court entered the new trial\n16   order.   Creditors timely appealed the new trial order.\n17\n18                              JURISDICTION\n19        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n20   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(F) and (J).

Property of the debtor\n14        Dolores first argues that she submitted evidence raising\n15   questions as to whether the Business Assets ever constituted the\n16   debtor’s property.    Dolores asserts that the debtor never\n17   intended to own the Business Assets.      She references the Asset\n18   Purchase Agreement and the Assignment, both of which provided\n19   that Applied would own the Qualtech Assets when the debtor\n20   assigned his rights under the Asset Purchase Agreement and made\n21   the Assignment to Applied.\n22        Dolores contends that she presented further evidence raising\n23   material factual issues as to whether the debtor owned the\n24   Business Assets under the alter ego theory.      She provided\n25   evidence that the businesses each kept separate books and\n26   records, even though they operated out of the same facility.\n27   Dolores also submitted evidence showing that the businesses did\n28   not transfer funds between themselves without regard to source or\n\n                                      32\n\f 1   obligation, as Creditors alleged.     The businesses exchanged funds\n 2   for various goods and services they provided to one another.\n 3        However, Dolores seeks to manufacture a genuine issue of\n 4   fact out of her subjective intent, which is belied by the reality\n 5   of her documented transactions with respect to the Business\n 6   Assets.    As the bankruptcy court pointed out, Dolores relies on\n 7   documents that indicated that the debtor owned the Business\n 8   Assets.    The loan resolution agreement was between Dolores and\n 9   the debtor only.    None of the businesses was a party to the loan\n10   resolution agreement.    The loan resolution agreement further\n11   allowed Dolores to take immediate possession of collateral under\n12   her loan agreement with the debtor, but the loan resolution\n13   agreement did not provide for any transfer of title or ownership.\n14   In fact, the loan resolution agreement left the Business Assets\n15   in place with the debtor.\n16        Dynamic and Electronic along with the debtor, Dolores and\n17   Kaufman Group were parties to the turnover agreement, but Applied\n18   was not.    Two lists of transferred assets were attached to the\n19   turnover agreement, without any indication or division of\n20   respective ownership interests among the debtor, Dynamic and\n21   Electronic.    If the subject lists included any of the Qualtech\n22   Assets, to the extent Applied owned them, it was not a party, and\n23   the subject assets were not transferred, unless the debtor had a\n24   continuing ownership interest in them.19\n25        At the summary judgment hearing, the bankruptcy court\n26\n          19\n27          Nothing in the record indicates that any interest in the\n     Qualtech Assets ever was assigned or transferred from Applied to\n28   either Dynamic or Electronic.\n\n                                      33\n\f 1   highlighted certain language in the turnover agreement indicating\n 2   that the Business Assets belonged to the debtor.    The relevant\n 3   provision of the turnover agreement stated that the debtor\n 4   “continuously and irrevocably tender[ed] . . . all right, title\n 5   and interest and full possession of, in and to all its asset\n 6   collateral not [now] in [Dolores’] possession . . . .”    Such\n 7   language, the bankruptcy court reasoned, indicated that the\n 8   debtor owned the Business Assets collateral, lists of which were\n 9   attached to the turnover agreement.   Further, the bankruptcy\n10   court concluded that the turnover agreement was more “explicit,\n11   in terms of what it says,” than the loan resolution agreement.\n12   Tr. of Sept. 18, 2012 hr’g, 11:6-7.\n13        Dolores maintains that the actual transfer of the Business\n14   Assets occurred on March 31, 2008, more than a year before the\n15   debtor filed for bankruptcy protection.   Following the transfer\n16   on March 31, 2008, she asserts that she owned the Business\n17   Assets, which she then leased back to the debtor.    The debtor\n18   thus did not own the Business Assets during the preference\n19   period.\n20        As the bankruptcy court noted, if Dolores actually owned the\n21   Business Assets outside of the preference period, then it made no\n22   sense (or, as the bankruptcy court put it, was “illogical”) for\n23   Dolores to file the UCC-1 financing statement on May 27, 2009.\n24   Like the bankruptcy court, we too wonder if she truly owned the\n25   Business Assets during the preference period, “why on earth would\n26   [Dolores] file a UCC-1 in 2009, on her own property?”\n27        On the record before us and then before the bankruptcy\n28   court, there is no genuine issue that the debtor owned at least\n\n                                    34\n\f 1   some interest in the Business Assets during the insider\n 2   preference period.   However, even if the businesses owned some of\n 3   the Business Assets to an unspecified extent, as conceded by\n 4   Dolores’ counsel at oral argument, the debtor’s transfer of all\n 5   the Business Assets to Dolores drained the stock that he wholly\n 6   owned in the businesses of all value, thus constituting a\n 7   preferential transfer.\n 8        We ultimately conclude, as did the bankruptcy court, that\n 9   Dolores did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n10   whether the debtor had a property interest of some type either in\n11   or with respect to the transferred Business Assets for purposes\n12   of a determination of preferential transfer under § 547(b).\n13             b.   Preference period\n14        Dolores next argues that she provided evidence raising\n15   material factual issues as to whether the debtor transferred the\n16   Business Assets to her within one year prepetition.   She points\n17   to the loan resolution agreement, dated March 31, 2008, under\n18   which she allegedly took possession of the Business Assets.\n19   According to Dolores, the loan resolution agreement proves that\n20   the transfer occurred more than one year before the debtor filed\n21   for bankruptcy protection on July 15, 2009.\n22        We give no credence to this argument.    As noted above, and\n23   as the bankruptcy court reasoned at the partial summary judgment\n24   hearing, if Dolores truly owned the Business Assets before the\n25   preference period began, why would she file the UCC-1 financing\n26   statement on her property on May 27, 2009, and enter into the\n27   subsequent turnover agreement that transferred title and\n28   ownership of the Business Assets?    Such actions indicate that the\n\n                                     35\n\f 1   debtor had not yet transferred the Business Assets to Dolores\n 2   before the preference period began.    Also, the loan resolution\n 3   agreement does not mention foreclosure by Dolores on the Business\n 4   Assets, and no notice of the purported transfer was provided at\n 5   that time to any third parties.\n 6        We thus conclude that Dolores did not raise a genuine issue\n 7   of material fact as to whether the transfer occurred outside of\n 8   the preference period.\n 9              c.   Secured creditor status\n10        Dolores finally contends that she raised a genuine issue of\n11   material fact as to whether, as a secured creditor, she received\n12   more than she would have in a chapter 7 liquidation.    She points\n13   out that payments to a fully secured creditor are not\n14   preferential because such payments do not deplete the bankruptcy\n15   estate.   They do not diminish the value of the bankruptcy estate\n16   because, while funds are removed from the bankruptcy estate, the\n17   secured creditor’s lien is reduced in equal amount.\n18        Dolores claims that she submitted evidence showing that she\n19   was a fully secured creditor.   However, the uncontradicted\n20   evidence before the bankruptcy court established that her claimed\n21   security interests were unperfected until she filed the UCC-1\n22   financing statement on May 27, 2009 – well within the preference\n23   period.

However, because her security interests were not\n 6   perfected until late in the preference period, such evidence was\n 7   ineffectual to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\n 8        Based on the foregoing, we determine that Dolores did not\n 9   present sufficient evidence to raise genuine factual issues as to\n10   the three contested elements for a preferential transfer under\n11   § 547(b).    We thus conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err\n12   in granting summary judgment on the § 547(b) claim.\n13   B.   Discharge Adversary\n14        According to their notice of appeal, Creditors appeal the\n15   new trial order.    But, in their appellate briefs, Creditors\n16   appear to be appealing both the § 523(a)(6) partial summary\n17   judgment order and the § 727(a)(2)(A) judgment.\n18        1.     Section 523(a)(6) claim\n19        Creditors contend that the bankruptcy court erred in\n20   refusing to except their debt from discharge under § 523(a)(6).\n21   They argue that they successfully established that the debtor\n22   intentionally and fraudulently transferred to Dolores the\n23   Business Assets because the bankruptcy court expressly found that\n24   he transferred the Business Assets to diminish his bankruptcy\n25   estate thereby defrauding his creditors.    Creditors maintain that\n26   the debtor’s intentional and fraudulent transfer constituted a\n27   “willful and malicious injury” within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n28        As noted above, the bankruptcy court granted summary\n\n                                      37\n\f 1   judgment in the debtor’s favor on Creditors’ § 523(a)(6) claim\n 2   for two reasons:    First, the § 523(a)(6) claim was not timely\n 3   filed.   Although the parties had stipulated to allow Creditors to\n 4   amend the Discharge Adversary complaint, there was no agreement\n 5   that the debtor could not assert an untimeliness defense to any\n 6   new claims that Creditors might assert in an amended complaint.\n 7   The deadline to file exception to discharge claims was\n 8   October 20, 2009.    The amended complaint asserting a § 523(a)(6)\n 9   claim for the first time was not filed until March 16, 2010.      The\n10   Creditors missed the deadline to assert their § 523(a)(6) claim.\n11   Rule 4007(c) provides that, “On motion of any party in interest\n12   after hearing on notice the court may for cause extend the time\n13   fixed under this subdivision.    The motion shall be filed before\n14   the time has expired.”    No such motion was filed by the Creditors\n15   to extend the deadline to file their § 523(a)(6) claim.     On this\n16   record, we perceive no error in the bankruptcy court dismissing\n17   the Creditors’ § 523(a)(6) claim as not timely filed.\n18        In addition, Creditors misapprehend § 523(a)(6).\n19   Section 523(a)(6) essentially encompasses intentional torts.\n20   Creditors’ claims arise out of breach of contract.    Under\n21   controlling Ninth Circuit case law, “‘a simple breach of contract\n22   is not the type of injury addressed by § 523(a)(6).’”    Petralia\n23   v. Jercich (In re Jercich), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771939\"><a href=\"/opinion/771939/in-re-george-jercich-debtor-james-a-petralia-v-george-jercich/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205 (9th Cir.\n24   2001)(quoting Snoke v. Riso (In re Riso), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593973\"><a href=\"/opinion/593973/in-re-mark-riso-shelly-riso-debtors-gary-l-snoke-v-mark-riso-shelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1154\n25   (9th Cir. 1992)).    The Ninth Circuit has held that “‘an\n26   intentional breach of contract is excepted from discharge under\n27   § 523(a)(6) only when it is accompanied by malicious and willful\n28   tortious conduct.’”    Jercich, 238 F.3d at 1205 (quoting Riso,\n\n                                      38\n\f 1   978 F.2d at 1154 (emphasis in original)).    Creditors only have\n 2   breach of contract claims with an after-the-fact argument that\n 3   the debtor’s alleged fraudulent transfer of the Business Assets\n 4   to Dolores constitutes a willful and malicious injury.    Their\n 5   embellished breach of contract claim does not support a willful\n 6   and malicious injury claim within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n 7   See Jercich, 238 F.3d at 1206.    We thus conclude that the\n 8   bankruptcy court did not err in determining, on an alternative\n 9   basis, that Creditors’ debt was not excepted from discharge under\n10   § 523(a)(6) due to a lack of evidence of the required subjective\n11   tortious intent.\n12        2.   Section 727(a)(2)(A) claim\n13        We now turn to Creditors’ appeal of the bankruptcy court’s\n14   determination on their § 727(a)(2)(A) claim.    Section\n15   727(a)(2)(A) provides that the bankruptcy court must deny the\n16   debtor’s discharge if the debtor, with intent to hinder, delay or\n17   defraud a creditor, transferred property of the debtor within one\n18   year prepetition.   Aubrey v. Thomas (In re Aubrey), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1960523\"><a href=\"/opinion/1960523/in-re-aubrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n19   273 (9th Cir. BAP 1990).   The creditor must demonstrate by a\n20   preponderance of evidence that:    1) the debtor transferred or\n21   concealed property; 2) the property belonged to the debtor;\n22   3) the transfer occurred within one year of his bankruptcy\n23   filing; and 4) the debtor made the transfer with the intent to\n24   hinder, delay or defraud a creditor.    Id. (citations omitted).\n25   The only element at issue on appeal is whether the Business\n26   Assets were property of the debtor.\n27        The bankruptcy court found in the Discharge Adversary that\n28   Creditors did not meet their burden of proof to establish that\n\n                                       39\n\f 1   the debtor owned the Business Assets for § 727(a)(2)(A) purposes.\n 2   The fact that the bankruptcy court concluded upon the more\n 3   extensive evidentiary record and legal arguments presented in the\n 4   Preference Adversary that a property interest of the debtor had\n 5   been transferred for preference purposes is not dispositive here.\n 6        Creditors argue that they established that the Business\n 7   Assets belonged to the debtor.   Creditors contend that the\n 8   businesses were the alter egos of the debtor.     Specifically, they\n 9   argue that:    1) the debtor jointly owned the Business Assets with\n10   the businesses; and 2) under California law, the shareholders of\n11   a dissolved corporation hold legal and equitable title to the\n12   dissolved corporation’s property, subject to the superior claims\n13   of its creditors.\n14        In determining whether alter ego liability applies, we must\n15   look to the law of the forum state.     Schwarzkopf, 626 F.3d at\n16   1037.   Here, California law applies.\n17        California recognizes alter ego liability:     1) “where ‘there\n18   is such a unity of interest and ownership that the individuality,\n19   or separateness, of the said person and corporation has ceased’”\n20   and 2) “where ‘adherence to the fiction of the separate existence\n21   of the corporation would . . . sanction a fraud or promote\n22   injustice.’”   Id. at 1038 (quoting Wood v. Elling Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   755, 761 n.9 (1977)).   This is a highly fact-intensive\n24   determination.   Factors suggesting an alter ego relationship\n25   include “‘[c]ommingling of funds and other assets [and] failure\n26   to segregate funds of the separate entities . . .; the treatment\n27   by an individual of the assets of the corporation as his own\n28   . . .; the disregard of legal formalities and the failure to\n\n                                      40\n\f 1   maintain arm’s length relationships among related entities . . .’\n 2   [and] the diversion [of assets from a corporation by or to a]\n 3   stockholder or other person or entity, to the detriment of\n 4   creditors, or the manipulation of assets . . . between entities\n 5   so as to concentrate the assets in one and the liabilities in\n 6   another.’”   Schwarzkopf, 626 F.3d at 1038 (quoting Associated\n 7   Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n 8   813-15 (1962)).\n 9        The bankruptcy court found that Creditors presented no\n10   evidence establishing that the businesses were the debtor’s alter\n11   egos, even though the joint pretrial order expressly listed this\n12   as an issue to be determined at trial.   We agree.\n13        Creditors also contend that upon dissolution of a\n14   corporation, its shareholders retain and own its assets.   But\n15   here, the dissolution of the businesses occurred after the\n16   Business Assets already had been transferred to Dolores.   By the\n17   time the businesses dissolved, they had no assets to distribute\n18   to the debtor.\n19        Based on our review of the record, we do not have a firm and\n20   definite conviction that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in\n21   finding that the Creditors had not met their burden of proof to\n22   establish that the Business Assets were the debtor’s property in\n23   the Discharge Adversary for purposes of their § 727(a)(2)(A)\n24   claim.\n25\n26                               CONCLUSION\n27        Both Dolores and Creditors contend on appeal that the\n28   bankruptcy court erred in its determinations in the adversary\n\n                                     41\n\f 1   proceedings.   Based on our review of the record, we conclude that\n 2   the bankruptcy court did not err.    Accordingly, we AFFIRM the\n 3   bankruptcy court’s rulings on appeal.\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                     42\n\f</pre>",
