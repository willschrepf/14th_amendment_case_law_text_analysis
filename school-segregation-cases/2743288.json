The Comptroller’s Letter Ruling also indicated that, due to previous correspondence from the Comptroller’s office, Bell might have been misled as to whether the Comptroller viewed access service charges as charges for an intrastate or interstate service.  The Comptroller made the following concession:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Therefore, we will not set up the access charges in Accounts 508 or 509 in the audits we have in progress.  </span>\n<span>However, this letter should put you on notice that we consider this to be a taxable receipt, and for franchise tax purposes, includable in the next tax return due on June 15, 1989.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(emphasis added).  åãæ</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>25Texas Public Utility Commission defines the term “services,” in pertinent part, as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Has its broadest and most inclusive meaning.  The term includes any act  performed, anything supplied, and </span>\n<span>any facilities used or supplied by a public utility in the performance of the utility’s duties . . . to its patrons . . . and the public</span>\n<span>.  The term also includes the interchange or facilities between two or more public utilities. . . .</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>26 Tex.

 apportionment of LEC “access charges.”  Thus, any possible reliance by Bell on the Comptroller’s past decisions would not require a different result.  This is particularly so where Bell received

Iowa Utilities Bd.</span>\n<span>, 525 U.S. 366, 414, 119 S.Ct. 721, 142 L.Ed.2d 835 (1999).  AT&amp;T and its corporate affiliates, known as the “Bell System,” virtually controlled all long-distance telephone service, most local telephone service, and a substantial amount of all telephone equipment manufacturing.  </span>\n<span>See United States v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </span>\n<span>552 F.Supp. 131, 222-23 (D.D.C. 1982), </span>\n<span>aff’d sub nom. Maryland v. United States</span>\n<span>, 460 U.S. 1001, 103 S.Ct. 1240, 75 L.Ed.2d 472 (1983).  However, in 1982, AT&amp;T entered into an antitrust consent decree, known as the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) that ended its industry dominance.  552 F.Supp. at 160-170, 222-234.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Under the MFJ, AT&amp;T was required to divest itself of local exchange subsidiaries and was grouped into regional operating companies which became known as the “Bell Operating Companies (BOCs).”  </span>\n<span>See </span>\n<span>47 U.S.C. § 153 (4) (2001); </span>\n<span>SBC Communications, Inc. v. F.C.C., </span>\n<span>154 F.3d 226, 230 (5</span>\n<span>th</span>\n<span> Cir. 1998).  Bell was a BOC and provided telecommunications services for customers physically located in Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Texas.  The United States was then divided into 161 Local Access Transport Areas (LATAs)</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 3)</sup><span> within which BOCs were permitted to operate and provide local telephone service.  154 F.3d at 231.  Within each LATA were local exchange carriers (LECs)</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 4)</sup><span> that connected their customers’ telephones to their  networks and facilities.  Bell operates as an LEC in LATAs in Texas and other states.</span>\n<span>   \t</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Because the MFJ permitted BOCs and/or LECs to retain their state-regulated, local service monopolies, they became subject to various restrictions on their lines of business.  The restrictions were intended to ensure that the BOCs would not use their monopoly control over LECs to impede competition in other markets.  </span>\n<span>United States v. Western Elec. Co.</span>\n<span>, 12 F.3d 225, 229 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  For instance, an LEC might find it particularly easy to attract local customers to contract for its long distance service and use its control of local service to place its long distance competitors at a disadvantage.  </span>\n<span>Iowa Utilities Board, </span>\n<span>525 U.S. at 416.  Thus, one such restriction prohibited LECs from offering any long distance service between LATAs, or interLATA service.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 5)</sup><span>  </span>\n<span>See Id.; SBC Communications, </span>\n<span>154 F.3d at 230</span>\n<span>; </span>\n<span>Western Elec. Co., </span>\n<span>12 F.3d at 228.  Thus, during the relevant time period, Bell was prohibited from providing any long distance telephone services.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 6)</sup><span>  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>II.\tLong Distance Telephone Service</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Because LECs such as Bell were prohibited from providing long distance telephone service, long distance calls or interLATA calls were transmitted by interexchange carriers (IXCs).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 7)</sup><span>  </span>\n<span>AT&amp;T Communications of Texas, L.P. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</span>\n<span>, </span>\n<span>186 S.W.3d 517, 521-22 (Tex. 2006)</span>\n<span>.  Under the MFJ, each LEC was allowed to transmit telecommunications information only between points within a single LATA, providing what is, basically, the traditional local telephone service.  The MFJ required LECs to provide their customers and IXCs equal exchange access</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 8)</sup><span> to their network facilities for the purpose of permitting IXCs to carry on their long distance telephone business. \t</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Thus, when a customer dialed a number in another LATA, the customer’s LEC would first transmit the signal to an IXC’s Point of Presence (POP).  In a typical interLATA long distance call, the originating caller’s LEC transports the signal from the caller’s telephone over the local loop</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 9)</sup><span> to the LEC’s central office where the call is switched and transported by a trunk line to the IXC’s POP.  This occurs nearly instantaneously. </span>\n<span> </span>\n<span>Typically, the LEC has switched the caller to their IXC before the caller has completed dialing the long distance number.  Once the signal reaches the IXC’s long distance switch, the IXC then switches the signal to its trunk facilities for transmission out-of-state to the local switch of a second LEC serving the receiving party.  The second LEC switches the signal to its local loop and ultimately the call is received.  The second LEC then reverses the process and a circuit is established over which the two parties can communicate.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>III.\tAccess and Operator Charges</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>An IXC’s cost of replicating Bell’s local network and facilities to provide long distance service from the LEC’s premises was prohibitive.  Thus, IXCs needed access to Bell’s network in order to sell long distance services to their customers, and the IXC’s customers needed access to the LEC’s network to complete long distance services purchased from IXCs. </span>\n<span> To recompense Bell for costs associated with maintaining its facilities and equipment utilized by IXCs and the IXCs’ customers, the Federal Communications Commission</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 10)</sup><span>  adopted uniform access charge rules.  The FCC’s rules required LECs to record their revenues in accordance with specified accounting rules and deposit accounts, determine what fraction of the LEC’s regulated expenses and investments in its facilities or network should be allocated to providing interstate access, and set charges or tariffs</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 11)</sup><span> Bell could charge its customers and IXCs.  </span>\n<span>See </span>\n<span>Access Charge Reform, CC Docket No. 96-262, First Report and Order, 12 FCC Red 15982, 15998-99 (1997) (</span>\n<span>Access Charge Reform Order</span>\n<span>), </span>\n<span>aff’d</span>\n<span>, </span>\n<span>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v.

National Bancshares Corp., </span>\n<span>584 S.W.2d 268, 270 (Tex. 1979), </span>\n<span>cert. denied</span>\n<span>, 444 U.S. 1016, 100 S.Ct. 667, 62 L.Ed.2d 645 (1980).  The Texas franchise tax is a tax on the value of this privilege.  </span>\n<span>Id. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>During calender years 1995-2001, Bell was an LEC in a number of states including Texas.  Because Bell conducted business inside and outside of Texas, its franchise tax was calculated by an apportionment formula.  Its company-wide taxable capital (net worth) and taxable earned surplus (net income) were apportioned between Bell’s business done in Texas and business done elsewhere to obtain a correct assessment of Texas franchise taxes.  This calculation and the resulting effect of having a larger proportion of gross receipts from business done in Texas may be stated as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Simply described, “net taxable earned surplus” is determined by (1) adjusting the amount of a corporate taxpayer’s federal taxable income to yield “taxable earned surplus,” (2) “apportioning” or attributing the taxable earned surplus to Texas; and (3) subtracting various allowable deductions from the apportioned taxable earned surplus.  Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.110(a) (West Supp. 2004). . . .</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Under tax code sections 171.106 and 171.110(2), taxable earned surplus is to be “apportioned” to Texas by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the corporation’s “gross receipts from business done in this state,” as determined under section 171.1032, tax code, and the denominator of which is the corporation’s “gross receipts from its entire business,” as determined under section 171.1051.  Id. at §§ 171.106(b), 171.110(a)(2). [footnote omitted].  Thus, the larger the corporation’s “gross receipts from business done in this state,” the larger the apportionment factor, and the larger percentage of its taxable earned surplus is subject to the franchise tax.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Anderson-Clayton Bros. Funeral Home, Inc. v. Strayhorn, </span>\n<span>149 S.W.3d 166, 169 (Tex.App.–Austin 2004, pet. denied).</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>As in </span>\n<span>Anderson-Clayton, </span>\n<span>the center of the present dispute is the apportionment of Bell’s receipts as either Texas or non-Texas receipts.  If Bell shows that more of its receipts in any tax year were not “gross receipts for business done in Texas” or were subject to an exemption from apportionment as Texas receipts, then the lesser the apportionment factor and consequently the lesser percentage of its taxable earned surplus is subject to the Texas franchise tax, </span>\n<span>i.e.,</span>\n<span> Bell owes less state franchise taxes.  Conversely, if the opposite is true, then the larger the apportionment factor and the greater its taxable earned surplus subject to the Texas franchise tax.  D</span>\n<span>oing more business in Texas generally results in higher franchise taxes. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The earned surplus apportionment statute in existence between 1995-2001 provided that Texas receipts are from “business done in Texas” as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>171.1032.  Determination of Gross Receipts From Business Done in this State for Taxable Earned Surplus</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(a) Except for the gross receipts of a corporation that are subject to the provisions of Section 171.1061, in apportioning taxable earned surplus, the gross receipts of a corporation from its business done in this state is the sum of the corporation’s receipts from:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(1) each sale of tangible personal property if the property is delivered or shipped to a buyer in this state regardless of the FOB point or another condition of the sale, and each sale of tangible personal property shipped from this state to a purchaser in another state in which the seller is not subject to any tax on, or measured by, net income, without regard to whether the tax is imposed;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(2) each service performed in this state;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(3) each rental of property situated in this state;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(4) each royalty for the use of a patent or copyright in this state; and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(5) other business done in this state.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Section 171.1032</span>\n<span>.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 16)</sup></p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In addition to this “gross receipts” statute, the Comptroller had adopted rules that exempted certain telephone company receipts from apportionment as Texas receipts for franchise tax purposes.  The Comptroller established the following exemption when apportioning the taxable capital (net worth) component of the franchise tax for telephone companies as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Telephone company receipts.  All receipts for calls of a telephone company in Texas are Texas receipts, </span>\n<span>except for receipts from interstate calls.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>34 Tex.

Admin. Code § 3.549(e)(43); § 3.557(e)(39).  Bell next asserts that apportioning its access and operator assistance charges as Texas receipts violates equal protection guarantees because Bell does not receive preferential tax treatment received by IXCs and transportation companies under the Comptroller’s Rules.  Finally, Bell contends that the trial court improperly excluded some of its summary judgment evidence. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>I.\tStandard of Review</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>When, as here, parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, each party in support of its motion necessarily takes the position that there is no genuine issue of fact in the case and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  </span>\n<span>City of Pflugerville v.

Tex. Att’y Gen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  The domestic companies operated wholly within Texas and provided long distance service to their customers.  They transmitted interstate long distance calls over their lines to the Texas border where their calls were picked up by another company who transmitted the calls to an out-of-state recipient.  The domestic company was paid for the use of their lines within Texas, and the out-of-state company was paid a commission for completing the call outside Texas.  </span>\n<span>Id. </span>\n<span>at 2.  In determining that the charges were “interstate” in nature and not subject to state tax, the Attorney General stated:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Under the facts here, the “gross receipts” sought to be taxed, were derived not from tolls on calls originating and ending within the confines of the State of Texas, but rather from tolls on calls originating in Texas and terminating in other states, or vice versa,  – in other words, in interstate commerce.  The fact that the telephone company in question receives only such part of the tolls as represents payment for the facilities and services furnished by it in transmitting the call from or to the borders of the State does not prevent such receipts from being stamped with the interstate commerce feature.      </span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Id. </span>\n<span>at 4.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In January 1952, the Attorney General was asked for a determination whether the gross receipts of a domestic telephone company from calls that were routed from points in Texas through New Mexico and back to Texas were subject to the Texas gross receipts tax.  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 1 (1952).  The Attorney General determined that the calls routed through New Mexico had to be “treated as transactions constituting interstate commerce”; </span>\n<span>id. </span>\n<span>at 5, and opined that the gross receipts tax was inapplicable because the tax was not apportioned between the interstate and intrastate segments of the call.  </span>\n<span>Id. </span>\n<span>at 6-7.  The 1952 Opinion also indicated that, if there was apportionment, access services could be subject to a state tax as follows:  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Although the gross receipts derived from the interstate business are not subject to this tax, that portion of the receipts representing wholly intrastate business which can be separated or segregated from the gross receipts is subject to the tax.  51 Am. Jur. 777, 779, 804, Taxation, Secs. 872, 874, 907, 908.  Therefore, the receipts from “loop services” and from charges </span>\n<span>received under contracts or agreements for the use of lines, equipment or facilities in Texas </span>\n<span>are subject to the tax even though such services may be incidental to an interstate communication.

Tex. Att’y Gen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  Because completion of the service owed by the domestic telephone company was interstate in nature,</span>\n<span> </span>\n<span>its revenues were considered derived from interstate commerce.  </span>\n<span>Id.</span>\n<span> at 4. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In the 1952 Opinion, the Attorney General recognized that, although the domestic telephone company’s calls were interstate transactions, a portion of its receipts would be taxable as Texas receipts if the state’s tax apportioned the company’s  “receipts from ‘loop services’ and from charges received </span>\n<span>under contracts or agreements for the use of lines, equipment or facilities in Texas</span>\n<span>.”  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 6-7 (1952).  In the 1952</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Opinion, the Attorney General did not describe a contract for a service to be delivered in another state but a contract for the use of facilities and/or equipment located in Texas.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>2.\t1972-2000 – Comptroller’s Rules and Policies </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In 1972, the Comptroller adopted an adjudicatory rule that “revenues from interstate toll charges are not ‘business done in Texas.’” </span>\n<span> See </span>\n<span>Comptroller Hearing No. 5587 (1972).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 32)</sup><span>  In Hearing No. 5587, four telephone companies sought a refund of franchise tax payments determined by apportioning charges from their long distance telephone service as Texas receipts.  All the telephone companies provided both local and long distance service to their customers.  After considering the 1940 and 1952 </span>\n<span>Opinions and relevant case law, the Comptroller held that “[r]evenues from interstate toll charges are not ‘business done in Texas.’”  In 1975, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule identical in its import to the Rule applicable here, </span>\n<span>i.e.,</span>\n<span> “[r]eceipts of a telephone company in Texas from interstate calls are not Texas receipts.”  Comptroller Rule 3.51 (1976).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 33)</sup><span>  </span>\n<span>Accord </span>\n<span>Comptroller Rule 3.403(c)(2) (1979).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 34)</sup><span>  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In 1983, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule similar to the 1952 Opinion as follows:  “[b]usiness within this state also includes fixed periodic access and equipment charges for equipment located in Texas whether used for intrastate or interstate communications.” </span>\n<span>See </span>\n<span>Comptroller Rule 3.56 (1983).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 35)</sup><span>  </span>\n<span>And, in conformity therewith, the Comptroller responded to a request by Bell for clarification in 1989 with a Letter Ruling stating:   “access charges [are] for intrastate service, for access to the local network by the long distance carrier.  These are not charges for interstate service provided by Southwestern Bell.”  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1989).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 36)</sup></p>\n<p><span>\tIn three successive Letter Rulings, the Comptroller adhered to its policy that access service charges for use of a telephone company’s local network and facilities were Texas receipts.  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1998); Comptroller Letter Ruling (1994); Comproller Letter Ruling (1992).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 37)</sup><span>  Thus, since the adoption of Franchise Tax Rule 3.56 in 1983, the Comptroller consistently treated access charges as intrastate services—Texas receipts.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>However, in 2000, the Comptroller differentiated between the apportionment of access charges paid by IXCs and EUCLs for franchise tax purposes finding that access charges paid to LECs by IXCs were non-Texas receipts while access charges paid to LECs by end users, EUCLs, remained Texas receipts.  </span>\n<span>See</span>\n<span> Tex. Comp. Pub. Acct’s. Hearing No. 35,677 (2000).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 38)</sup><span>  In an earlier unrelated proceeding, Hearing No. 35,677, the Comptroller determined that, under a literal translation of Rule 3.557(e)(39), access charges paid by IXCs to LECs were “revenue from an interstate telephone call” because IXCs incurred an access charge when an actual interstate telephone call was made,</span>\n<span> i.e., </span>\n<span>the access charge was based on the interstate minutes of use of the LEC’s network by the IXC.  *19-20.  On the other hand, the Comptroller determined EUCLs paid by end users to LECs were not “revenue from an interstate telephone call” because LECs billed EUCLs even if no interstate telephone call was made by or to the customer,</span>\n<span> i.e., </span>\n<span>the EUCL was a fixed charge to all telephone customers to compensate LECs for use of the network to be able to place and receive interstate telephone calls. *19-20.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 39)</sup></p>\n<p><span>\tThus, in 1972, the Comptroller initially recognized the policy that revenues from interstate long distance calls were not “business done in Texas,” and, in 1975, adopted a conforming franchise tax Rule, </span>\n<span>i.e.</span>\n<span>, receipts “from interstate calls are not Texas receipts.”  Since 1983, the Comptroller consistently recognized through Rule, Letter Rulings, and adjudication that EUCLs were not “revenue from an interstate telephone call” but apportionable under the franchise tax statutes as Texas receipts.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 40)</sup><span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>3.\t</span>\n<span>Interstate Commerce – Analogous Texas and Federal Cases</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Analogous case law also supports the proposition originally stated in the 1952 Opinion that underlies the Comptroller’s subsequent Rules, Letter Rulings, and Adjudicatory Ruling related to EUCLs.  That is, where a service contract is for the use of telephone facilities located in Texas, performance of the contract is intrastate</span>\n<span>.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>For instance, in </span>\n<span>Clark v. Atlantic Pipe Line Co.</span>\n<span>, 134 S.W.2d 322 (Tex.Civ.App.–Austin 1939, writ ref’d), oil shippers contracted directly with Atlantic Pipe Line (“Atlantic”) to ship oil from locations in Texas and other states to Texas Gulf ports where the oil was to be loaded onto ocean-going vessels and shipped to other states or foreign countries.  </span>\n<span>Id.</span>\n<span> at 324-25.  Although recognizing that the phrase “business done in Texas” was “broad enough to include that segregated portion of interstate business which is wholly performed within the State,” the </span>\n<span>court held that Texas could not tax Atlantic’s proceeds from shipping oil in, or through, Texas because the oil’s shipment would not be completed until it reached another state or foreign country. </span>\n<span> Id</span>\n<span>. at 328.  The court held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>We hold that the language, “business done in Texas,” as employed in this statute was intended to mean business begun and completed in Texas, and not business begun in Texas and completed in some other state or foreign nation, or vice versa.  In other words, that it means intrastate business.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Id.</span>\n<span>  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Thus, Atlantic engaged in “interstate business” by contracting directly with oil shippers to ship their oil through its pipeline located in Texas to an ocean vessel destined for delivery in another state or foreign country.  Atlantic’s “business” was not providing the oil shippers with access to, or leasing, its pipeline in order for the oil shippers to ship the oil themselves.  In the first instance, Atlantic is engaged in interstate commerce because the “business” of shipping the oil is not complete until the oil is delivered in another state or country.  In the second instance, Atlantic would be engaged in intrastate commerce because the “business” of providing access to, or leasing, facilities in Texas begins and ends with the facilities in Texas.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Bullock v. Enserch Exploration, Inc.</span>\n<span>, 614 S.W.2d 215 (Tex.Civ.App.–Austin 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.), </span>\n<span>cert. denied</span>\n<span>, 455 U.S. 946, 102 S.Ct. 1445, 71 L.Ed.2d 659 (1982), is also instructive.  In </span>\n<span>Bullock</span>\n<span>,  the “critical issue [was] whether [Enserch’s] sale of natural gas with deliveries [by pipeline] in Texas to interstate companies for resale outside of Texas constituted “business done in Texas.”  </span>\n<span>Id. </span>\n<span>at 216.  The </span>\n<span>court </span>\n<span>held that the sale of gas by a Texas gas company to an interstate pipeline company for resale outside of Texas represented “gross receipts from its business in Texas.”  614 S.W.2d at 217.  Enserch had neither a contract for the sale of gas to an out-of-state purchaser nor a contract to ship gas produced in Texas out of state.  There simply was no interstate component to Enserch’s business – Texas gas was shipped and sold in Texas.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>  </span>\n<span>\tUnited States Supreme Court opinions determining what business constitutes “interstate commerce” are also instructive.  </span>\n<span>See Atlantic Pipe Line Co.</span>\n<span>, 134 S.W.2d at 327.  For instance, in </span>\n<span>People of State of New York ex rel. Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Knight, </span>\n<span>192 U.S. 21, 24 S.Ct. 202, 48 L.Ed. 325 (1904), a company operating a ferry located in New York established a cab stand at the ferry station whose sole business was to bring the company’s passengers to and from the ferry. </span>\n<span> </span>\n<span>192 U.S. at 22 .  Charges for the taxi service were separate from the company’s charges for further transportation by ferry across state lines, and no part of the receipts from the cab service were received as compensation for any service outside the State of New York.  </span>\n<span>Id.  </span>\n<span>The </span>\n<span>Knight </span>\n<span>court held that the cab service was “an independent local service, preliminary or subsequent to any interstate transportation” constituting intrastate commerce. </span>\n<span> Id.</span>\n<span> </span>\n<span>at  26-28.  The </span>\n<span>Knight </span>\n<span>court reasoned as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>As we have seen, the cab service is rendered wholly within the state, and has no contractual or necessary relation to interstate transportation.  It is either preliminary or subsequent thereto.  It is independently contracted for, and not necessarily connected therewith.  But when service is wholly within a state, it is presumably subject to state control.  The burden is on him who asserts that, though actually within, it is legally outside, the state; and unless the interstate character is established, locality determines the questions of jurisdiction.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Id.</span>\n<span> at 27.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Here, like </span>\n<span>Knight</span>\n<span>, Bell’s access services are independently contracted for and wholly performed in Texas.  Moreover, because Bell was required to provide network access to all its customers seeking local or long distance service, it was legally prohibited at the time from engaging in </span>\n<span>any </span>\n<span>long distance service or competing with any long distance carrier and charged its customers EUCLs whether they made or received any long distance calls, its service did not bear any necessary relation or connection to the provision of any interstate long distance telephone service.  Bell’s network facilities were mere instrumentalities of commerce whereby Bell exacted a fee for its customers’ use of its lines and switches located in Texas to complete their long distance telephone business with an IXC.  As such, Bell’s service is intrastate; </span>\n<span>see Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corporation Tax Appeal Board of Michigan</span>\n<span>, 294 U.S. 83, 85, 55 S.Ct. 332, 79 L.Ed. 777 (1935) (toll bridge is an “instrumentality which others may use in conducting foreign commerce”); </span>\n<span>Henderson Bridge Co. v. Kentucky</span>\n<span>, 166 U.S. 150, 153-54, 17 S.Ct. 532, 41 L.Ed. 953 (1897),</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 41)</sup><span> </span>\n<span>i.e.</span>\n<span>, Bell’s  local service customers and IXCs merely paid Bell for the privilege of using its Texas facilities so that they, in turn, could engage in interstate commerce</span>\n<span>.  Id.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 42)</sup><span>  </span>\n<span>Accordingly, we find as reasonable the Comptroller’s </span>\n<span>ad hoc </span>\n<span>rule recognized in the 2000 Hearing and applied here</span>\n<span>.    </span>\n<span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In addition, where, as here, </span>\n<span>the Comptroller has adopted an </span>\n<span>ad hoc </span>\n<span>rule that has a retroactive effect, </span>\n<span>Grocers Supply Company, Inc. v. Sharp, </span>\n<span>978 S.W.2d 638, 643-44 (Tex.App.–Austin 1998, pet. denied), “the reviewing court must also determine whether application of the new policy to a party who relied on the old is so unfair as to be arbitrary and capricious.”  </span>\n<span>Microcomputer Technology Institute v. Riley</span>\n<span>, 139 F.3d 1044, 1050 (5</span>\n<span>th</span>\n<span> Cir. 1998) (citing 1 K. Davis &amp; R. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 3.5 at 120 (1994)).  Because the Comptroller’s </span>\n<span>ad hoc </span>\n<span>rule is consistent with the Attorney General’s longstanding interpretation rendered in the 1952 Opinion, agency policy interpretations since 1983 and applicable state and federal caselaw, we find the retroactive application of the </span>\n<span>ad hoc </span>\n<span>rule regarding LECs non-exempt status for access charges is not “so unfair as to be arbitrary and capricious.”  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Bell contends the access charges are “revenues from interstate calls” because an interstate long distance call cannot originate or terminate without access to Bell’s local loop and long distance calls are by nature uninterrupted transmissions of an electronic signal.  However, under these circumstances, whether a voice transmission may be uninterrupted is a distinction without a difference</span>\n<span>.  See Knight</span>\n<span>, 192 U.S. at 26-28; </span>\n<span>Bullock</span>\n<span>, 613 S.W.2d at 216-17. When state taxation of activities or property within a state is at issue, “[i]t is no longer a question of actual interruption of the operation of commerce,” </span>\n<span>and the fact that the interstate activities could not be conducted without the local activities is not conclusive.  </span>\n<span>Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone, </span>\n<span>335 U.S. 80, 95-96, 68 S.Ct. 1475, 92 L.Ed.2d 1832 (1948).  “Rather, a prohibited tax exaction is one beyond the power of the state because the taxable event is outside its boundaries or for a privilege the state cannot grant.”  </span>\n<span>Id</span>\n<span>.  Here, the privilege to conduct business in Texas is a privilege Texas can grant and the taxable event is confined to Texas – payment of a service charge to Bell by a Texas customer for the use of, or access to, Bell’s facilities located in Texas. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span> Moreover, the FCC’s interpretation of the nature of the “interconnection” provided by Bell when granting access to its network also supports this result.  As discussed earlier, during the relevant time period, Bell was required to provide local telephone service and/or offer local access for long-distance service.  </span>\n<span>See </span>\n<span>47 U.S.C. § 153 (2001).  This duty included providing for an “interconnection” between Bell’s network and the “facilities and equipment” of IXCs.  </span>\n<span>See</span>\n<span> </span>\n<span>id. </span>\n<span>at § 15.  The FCC has interpreted the term “interconnection” to be the “physical linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.”  </span>\n<span>Competitive Telecommunications Ass’n v. F.C.C.</span>\n<span>, 117 F.3d 1068, 1071-72 (8</span>\n<span>th</span>\n<span> Cir. 1997).  </span>\n<span>See Southwestern Bell Telephone, L.P. v. Missouri Public Service Com’n</span>\n<span>, 530 F.3d 676, 684 (8</span>\n<span>th</span>\n<span> Cir. 2008).  </span>\n<span>The FCC’s interpretation of the term “interconnection” does not include the transmission or routing of telephone calls.  </span>\n<span>Competitive Telecommunications Ass’n, </span>\n<span>117 F.3d at 1071-72.  Thus, Bell offers IXCs access to its telephone exchange service or facilities “for the </span>\n<span>purpose</span>\n<span> of origination and termination of telephone toll service.”  47 U.S.C. § 153(a)(16) (2001) (emphasis added).  Although the access service Bell offers to its local customers may also include the transmission of their calls over its local network to the IXC’s POP,</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 43)</sup><span> for practical and business purposes, Bell’s transmission ceases when its service is completed at the IXC’s POP where Bell “interconnects” with the IXC’s long distance facilities.  Thus, the EUCLs and special access charges are local charges for a service that begins at the local customers’ premises and ends at the IXC’s POP in Texas, </span>\n<span>i.e</span>\n<span>., begins and ends in Texas.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Although the parties acknowledge that an “interstate telephone call is a complete end-to-end communication that crosses state lines,” Bell’s access service is not a part of the interstate service provided by the IXC.  In a business and practical sense, Bell leases its network to its customer for the purpose of originating and terminating long distance calls. Moreover, Bell supplies no more than an “interconnection” at the IXC’s POP and does not transmit or share in the IXC’s transmission of the call across state lines.  Bell’s access service is completed when its local customer’s call reaches the IXC’s POP, and again, when Bell’s lines pick up the return signal at the IXC’s POP and transports the signal to the customer’s premises.  As such, Bell’s role is prepatory and incidental to any interstate commerce being conducted between the IXC and its customer.  Although the telecommunications industry is highly technical, we must not lose sight of the fact that “taxation is a practical matter, and that what constitutes commerce, manufacture, or production is to be determined upon practical considerations.”  </span>\n<span>Utah Power &amp; Light Co.</span>\n<span>, 286 U.S. at 178-79. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Bell also asserts the access charges are interstate rather than intrastate because access charges are federally tariffed charges created under the auspices of the FCC.  However, there is no federal mandate giving the FCC exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation or taxation of telecommunications companies.  Simply because the FCC regulates telephone companies does not mean that the regulated activities are solely, or necessarily, interstate.  Congress may regulate purely intrastate telephone activity to protect interstate commerce.  </span>\n<span>See United States v. Lopez</span>\n<span>, 514 U.S. 549, 558, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995); </span>\n<span>United States v. Gilbert</span>\n<span>, 181 F.3d 152, 158 (1</span>\n<span>st</span>\n<span> Cir. 1999)</span>\n<span> (discussing the “long standing” line of cases holding Congress may regulate purely intrastate telephone activity under the Commerce Clause).  Moreover, the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 disclaims authority over state taxation.  110 Stat. 56, 144 (“nothing in this Act . . . shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede . . . any State or local law pertaining to taxation”).  “Federal regulation does not preclude state taxation and state taxation does not preclude federal regulation.”  </span>\n<span>Polish Nat.

N.L.R.B.</span>\n<span>, 322 U.S. 643, 649, 64 S.Ct. 1196, 88 L.Ed. 1509 (1944).  Thus, we decline to disturb the Comptroller’s determination that, while the FCC’s regulation and classification of access charges is informative, it is not determinative.  </span>\n<span>See </span>\n<span>Comp.

Rylander</span>\n<span>, 38 S.W.3d 600, 609 (Tex.App.–Austin 2000, pet. denied).  Although all persons falling within the same class must be taxed alike</span>\n<span>, a classification will not be found deficient unless it has no rational basis.</span>\n<span>  Upjohn</span>\n<span>, 38 S.W.3d at 609</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Despite that LECs and IXCs may utilize similar equipment and facilities to transmit telephone calls, Bell has failed to establish the lack of any rational basis for distinguishing between LECs and IXCs for tax purposes.  The business activities of LECs and IXCs are dissimilar because each operates in separate and distinct areas.  LECs charge local customers </span>\n<span>and </span>\n<span>IXCs</span>\n<span> </span>\n<span>for access to, or use of, its intrastate facilities and equipment to transmit the call from the customer’s premises to an IXC’s POP.  Once the call reaches the IXC’s POP, the IXC then utilizes its facilities and equipment to transmit its customer’s call out of state. The customer contracts with the LEC for local service and access service to complete long distance calls and independently contracts with an IXC for long distance service.  That Bell provides a different service than the IXC and Bell’s service is intrastate rather than interstate establishes rational bases for distinguishing an LEC such as Bell from IXCs for franchise tax classification purposes.  </span>\n<span>See Westcott Communications, Inc.</span>\n<span>, 104 S.W.3d 141, 150 (Tex.App.–Austin 2003, pet. denied).  Moreover, an LEC cannot engage in the service supplied by the IXC.  Because Bell was permitted to maintain its monopoly on “local” telephone service, it was legally prohibited from providing any interstate long distance service to its local customers. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Regarding transportation companies, the differences are even more striking.  Not only do the two industries offer different services that neither can engage in on their own, they do not utilize similar equipment or facilities.  Moreover, that telephone services may be analogous to transportation services in the abstract is an insufficient basis for contending there is no rational basis for differing tax classifications.  </span>\n<span>See Westcott, </span>\n<span>104 S.W.3d at 150.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 48)</sup></p>\n<p><span>\tTo the extent Bell contends it is treated differently from IXCs because these services are classified by the Comptroller as intrastate rather than interstate, we have already addressed the issue.  </span>\n<span>Accordingly, Bell has failed to establish that the Comptroller makes an arbitrary and unreasonable distinction between these taxpayers and issue two is also overruled.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>V.\tSummary Judgment Evidence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Bell contends the trial court improperly excluded non-expert testimony in the summary judgment proceedings below.  While Bell notes the Comptroller objected to “selected testimony” of two witnesses, Bell does not identify the specific testimony improperly excluded by the trial court and states, “[t]he trial court improperly sustained </span>\n<span>some</span>\n<span> of these objections.”  Bell did not file a written response to the Comptroller’s objections nor move for reconsideration of the trial court’s decision to sustain the Comptroller’s objections to the affidavits of the two witnesses.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>An appellant bears the burden of bringing forth a record that demonstrates the trial court abused its discretion when it sustained an appellee’s objections to the summary judgment evidence</span>\n<span>.  Cantu v. Horany</span>\n<span>, 195 S.W.3d 867, 871 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2006, no pet.)  Where the record fails to show that a party objected to the trial court’s ruling sustaining an opponent’s objection to his or her summary judgment evidence, the party has not preserved the right to complain on appeal about the trial court’s ruling. </span>\n<span> Id</span>\n<span>.   </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Because Bell objects to “some” but not all of the possible grounds for the trial court’s ruling that sustained the objection, Bell has waived the issue.  </span>\n<span>See Malone v. Foster</span>\n<span>, 956 S.W.2d 573, 579 (Tex.App.–Dallas 1997), </span>\n<span>aff’d</span>\n<span>, 977 S.W.2d 562 (1998).  Moreover, there is nothing in the record to show that Bell filed a written response to the Comptroller’s written Objections to Plaintiff’s Summary Judgment Evidence nor filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court’s order sustaining the Comptroller’s objections.  Neither were Bell’s issues preserved.  Bell’s third issue is also overruled.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>CONCLUSION</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Having overruled Southwestern Bell Telephone Company’s issues, the trial court’s judgment is affirmed.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Patrick A.

Tax Code Ann. § 171.110(a) (West Supp. 2004). . . .</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Under tax code sections 171.106 and 171.110(2), taxable earned surplus is to be “apportioned” to Texas by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the corporation’s “gross receipts from business done in this state,” as determined under section 171.1032, tax code, and the denominator of which is the corporation’s “gross receipts from its entire business,” as determined under section 171.1051.  Id. at §§ 171.106(b), 171.110(a)(2). [footnote omitted].  Thus, the larger the corporation’s “gross receipts from business done in this state,” the larger the apportionment factor, and the larger percentage of its taxable earned surplus is subject to the franchise tax.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Anderson-Clayton Bros.

Admin. Code § 3.549(e)(43); § 3.557(e)(39).  Bell next asserts that apportioning its access and operator assistance charges as Texas receipts violates equal protection guarantees because Bell does not receive preferential tax treatment received by IXCs and transportation companies under the Comptroller’s Rules.  Finally, Bell contends that the trial court improperly excluded some of its summary judgment evidence. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>I.\tStandard of Review</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>When, as here, parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, each party in support of its motion necessarily takes the position that there is no genuine issue of fact in the case and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  </span>\n<span>City of Pflugerville v.

Tex. Att’y Gen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  The domestic companies operated wholly within Texas and provided long distance service to their customers.  They transmitted interstate long distance calls over their lines to the Texas border where their calls were picked up by another company who transmitted the calls to an out-of-state recipient.  The domestic company was paid for the use of their lines within Texas, and the out-of-state company was paid a commission for completing the call outside Texas.  </span>\n<span>Id. </span>\n<span>at 2.  In determining that the charges were “interstate” in nature and not subject to state tax, the Attorney General stated:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Under the facts here, the “gross receipts” sought to be taxed, were derived not from tolls on calls originating and ending within the confines of the State of Texas, but rather from tolls on calls originating in Texas and terminating in other states, or vice versa,  – in other words, in interstate commerce.  The fact that the telephone company in question receives only such part of the tolls as represents payment for the facilities and services furnished by it in transmitting the call from or to the borders of the State does not prevent such receipts from being stamped with the interstate commerce feature.      </span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Id. </span>\n<span>at 4.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In January 1952, the Attorney General was asked for a determination whether the gross receipts of a domestic telephone company from calls that were routed from points in Texas through New Mexico and back to Texas were subject to the Texas gross receipts tax.  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 1 (1952).  The Attorney General determined that the calls routed through New Mexico had to be “treated as transactions constituting interstate commerce”; </span>\n<span>id. </span>\n<span>at 5, and opined that the gross receipts tax was inapplicable because the tax was not apportioned between the interstate and intrastate segments of the call.  </span>\n<span>Id. </span>\n<span>at 6-7.  The 1952 Opinion also indicated that, if there was apportionment, access services could be subject to a state tax as follows:  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Although the gross receipts derived from the interstate business are not subject to this tax, that portion of the receipts representing wholly intrastate business which can be separated or segregated from the gross receipts is subject to the tax.  51 Am. Jur. 777, 779, 804, Taxation, Secs. 872, 874, 907, 908.  Therefore, the receipts from “loop services” and from charges </span>\n<span>received under contracts or agreements for the use of lines, equipment or facilities in Texas </span>\n<span>are subject to the tax even though such services may be incidental to an interstate communication.

Tex. Att’y Gen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  Because completion of the service owed by the domestic telephone company was interstate in nature,</span>\n<span> </span>\n<span>its revenues were considered derived from interstate commerce.  </span>\n<span>Id.</span>\n<span> at 4. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In the 1952 Opinion, the Attorney General recognized that, although the domestic telephone company’s calls were interstate transactions, a portion of its receipts would be taxable as Texas receipts if the state’s tax apportioned the company’s  “receipts from ‘loop services’ and from charges received </span>\n<span>under contracts or agreements for the use of lines, equipment or facilities in Texas</span>\n<span>.”  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 6-7 (1952).  In the 1952</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Opinion, the Attorney General did not describe a contract for a service to be delivered in another state but a contract for the use of facilities and/or equipment located in Texas.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>2.\t1972-2000 – Comptroller’s Rules and Policies </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In 1972, the Comptroller adopted an adjudicatory rule that “revenues from interstate toll charges are not ‘business done in Texas.’” </span>\n<span> See </span>\n<span>Comptroller Hearing No. 5587 (1972).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 32)</sup><span>  In Hearing No. 5587, four telephone companies sought a refund of franchise tax payments determined by apportioning charges from their long distance telephone service as Texas receipts.  All the telephone companies provided both local and long distance service to their customers.  After considering the 1940 and 1952 </span>\n<span>Opinions and relevant case law, the Comptroller held that “[r]evenues from interstate toll charges are not ‘business done in Texas.’”  In 1975, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule identical in its import to the Rule applicable here, </span>\n<span>i.e.,</span>\n<span> “[r]eceipts of a telephone company in Texas from interstate calls are not Texas receipts.”  Comptroller Rule 3.51 (1976).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 33)</sup><span>  </span>\n<span>Accord </span>\n<span>Comptroller Rule 3.403(c)(2) (1979).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 34)</sup><span>  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In 1983, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule similar to the 1952 Opinion as follows:  “[b]usiness within this state also includes fixed periodic access and equipment charges for equipment located in Texas whether used for intrastate or interstate communications.” </span>\n<span>See </span>\n<span>Comptroller Rule 3.56 (1983).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 35)</sup><span>  </span>\n<span>And, in conformity therewith, the Comptroller responded to a request by Bell for clarification in 1989 with a Letter Ruling stating:   “access charges [are] for intrastate service, for access to the local network by the long distance carrier.  These are not charges for interstate service provided by Southwestern Bell.”  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1989).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 36)</sup></p>\n<p><span>\tIn three successive Letter Rulings, the Comptroller adhered to its policy that access service charges for use of a telephone company’s local network and facilities were Texas receipts.  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1998); Comptroller Letter Ruling (1994); Comproller Letter Ruling (1992).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 37)</sup><span>  Thus, since the adoption of Franchise Tax Rule 3.56 in 1983, the Comptroller consistently treated access charges as intrastate services—Texas receipts.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>However, in 2000, the Comptroller differentiated between the apportionment of access charges paid by IXCs and EUCLs for franchise tax purposes finding that access charges paid to LECs by IXCs were non-Texas receipts while access charges paid to LECs by end users, EUCLs, remained Texas receipts.  </span>\n<span>See</span>\n<span> Tex. Comp. Pub. Acct’s. Hearing No. 35,677 (2000).</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 38)</sup><span>  In an earlier unrelated proceeding, Hearing No. 35,677, the Comptroller determined that, under a literal translation of Rule 3.557(e)(39), access charges paid by IXCs to LECs were “revenue from an interstate telephone call” because IXCs incurred an access charge when an actual interstate telephone call was made,</span>\n<span> i.e., </span>\n<span>the access charge was based on the interstate minutes of use of the LEC’s network by the IXC.  *19-20.  On the other hand, the Comptroller determined EUCLs paid by end users to LECs were not “revenue from an interstate telephone call” because LECs billed EUCLs even if no interstate telephone call was made by or to the customer,</span>\n<span> i.e., </span>\n<span>the EUCL was a fixed charge to all telephone customers to compensate LECs for use of the network to be able to place and receive interstate telephone calls. *19-20.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 39)</sup></p>\n<p><span>\tThus, in 1972, the Comptroller initially recognized the policy that revenues from interstate long distance calls were not “business done in Texas,” and, in 1975, adopted a conforming franchise tax Rule, </span>\n<span>i.e.</span>\n<span>, receipts “from interstate calls are not Texas receipts.”  Since 1983, the Comptroller consistently recognized through Rule, Letter Rulings, and adjudication that EUCLs were not “revenue from an interstate telephone call” but apportionable under the franchise tax statutes as Texas receipts.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 40)</sup><span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>3.\t</span>\n<span>Interstate Commerce – Analogous Texas and Federal Cases</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Analogous case law also supports the proposition originally stated in the 1952 Opinion that underlies the Comptroller’s subsequent Rules, Letter Rulings, and Adjudicatory Ruling related to EUCLs.  That is, where a service contract is for the use of telephone facilities located in Texas, performance of the contract is intrastate</span>\n<span>.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>For instance, in </span>\n<span>Clark v. Atlantic Pipe Line Co.</span>\n<span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3968101\"><a href=\"/opinion/4197444/clark-v-atlantic-pipe-line-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span> (Tex.Civ.App.–Austin 1939, writ ref’d), oil shippers contracted directly with Atlantic Pipe Line (“Atlantic”) to ship oil from locations in Texas and other states to Texas Gulf ports where the oil was to be loaded onto ocean-going vessels and shipped to other states or foreign countries.  </span>\n<span>Id.</span>\n<span> at 324-25.  Although recognizing that the phrase “business done in Texas” was “broad enough to include that segregated portion of interstate business which is wholly performed within the State,” the </span>\n<span>court held that Texas could not tax Atlantic’s proceeds from shipping oil in, or through, Texas because the oil’s shipment would not be completed until it reached another state or foreign country. </span>\n<span> Id</span>\n<span>. at 328.  The court held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>We hold that the language, “business done in Texas,” as employed in this statute was intended to mean business begun and completed in Texas, and not business begun in Texas and completed in some other state or foreign nation, or vice versa.  In other words, that it means intrastate business.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Id.</span>\n<span>  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Thus, Atlantic engaged in “interstate business” by contracting directly with oil shippers to ship their oil through its pipeline located in Texas to an ocean vessel destined for delivery in another state or foreign country.  Atlantic’s “business” was not providing the oil shippers with access to, or leasing, its pipeline in order for the oil shippers to ship the oil themselves.  In the first instance, Atlantic is engaged in interstate commerce because the “business” of shipping the oil is not complete until the oil is delivered in another state or country.  In the second instance, Atlantic would be engaged in intrastate commerce because the “business” of providing access to, or leasing, facilities in Texas begins and ends with the facilities in Texas.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Bullock v.

Moreover, Bell supplies no more than an “interconnection” at the IXC’s POP and does not transmit or share in the IXC’s transmission of the call across state lines.  Bell’s access service is completed when its local customer’s call reaches the IXC’s POP, and again, when Bell’s lines pick up the return signal at the IXC’s POP and transports the signal to the customer’s premises.  As such, Bell’s role is prepatory and incidental to any interstate commerce being conducted between the IXC and its customer.  Although the telecommunications industry is highly technical, we must not lose sight of the fact that “taxation is a practical matter, and that what constitutes commerce, manufacture, or production is to be determined upon practical considerations.”  </span>\n<span>Utah Power &amp; Light Co.</span>\n<span>, 286 U.S. at 178-79. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Bell also asserts the access charges are interstate rather than intrastate because access charges are federally tariffed charges created under the auspices of the FCC.  However, there is no federal mandate giving the FCC exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation or taxation of telecommunications companies.  Simply because the FCC regulates telephone companies does not mean that the regulated activities are solely, or necessarily, interstate.  Congress may regulate purely intrastate telephone activity to protect interstate commerce.  </span>\n<span>See United States v.

XIV.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 46)</sup><span>  Bell asserts that, although it is similarly situated, IXCs and transportation companies receive preferential treatment because their receipts from intrastate “legs” of interstate telephone service and/or transportation are not apportioned as Texas receipts.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 47)</sup><span>  Bell also contends that LECs are similar to IXCs because they both participate in the transmission of an interstate phone call utilizing like equipment and facilities located in Texas.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Although states generally have broad powers to impose and collect taxes, classifications among taxpayers may not be arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.</span>\n<span>  See Hurt v.

The customer contracts with the LEC for local service and access service to complete long distance calls and independently contracts with an IXC for long distance service.  That Bell provides a different service than the IXC and Bell’s service is intrastate rather than interstate establishes rational bases for distinguishing an LEC such as Bell from IXCs for franchise tax classification purposes.  </span>\n<span>See Westcott Communications, Inc.</span>\n<span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span>, 150 (Tex.App.–Austin 2003, pet. denied).  Moreover, an LEC cannot engage in the service supplied by the IXC.  Because Bell was permitted to maintain its monopoly on “local” telephone service, it was legally prohibited from providing any interstate long distance service to its local customers. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Regarding transportation companies, the differences are even more striking.  Not only do the two industries offer different services that neither can engage in on their own, they do not utilize similar equipment or facilities.  Moreover, that telephone services may be analogous to transportation services in the abstract is an insufficient basis for contending there is no rational basis for differing tax classifications.  </span>\n<span>See Westcott, </span>\n<span>104 S.W.3d at 150.</span>\n<sup>(footnote: 48)</sup></p>\n<p><span>\tTo the extent Bell contends it is treated differently from IXCs because these services are classified by the Comptroller as intrastate rather than interstate, we have already addressed the issue.  </span>\n<span>Accordingly, Bell has failed to establish that the Comptroller makes an arbitrary and unreasonable distinction between these taxpayers and issue two is also overruled.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>V.\tSummary Judgment Evidence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Bell contends the trial court improperly excluded non-expert testimony in the summary judgment proceedings below.  While Bell notes the Comptroller objected to “selected testimony” of two witnesses, Bell does not identify the specific testimony improperly excluded by the trial court and states, “[t]he trial court improperly sustained </span>\n<span>some</span>\n<span> of these objections.”  Bell did not file a written response to the Comptroller’s objections nor move for reconsideration of the trial court’s decision to sustain the Comptroller’s objections to the affidavits of the two witnesses.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>An appellant bears the burden of bringing forth a record that demonstrates the trial court abused its discretion when it sustained an appellee’s objections to the summary judgment evidence</span>\n<span>.  Cantu v.
