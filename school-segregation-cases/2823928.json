Goldstein, GOLDSTEIN, HANDLER\n& WHITE, P.C., Bethesda, Maryland, for Appellant. Charles W.\nThompson, Jr., County Attorney, Linda B. Thall, Senior Assistant\nCounty Attorney, Rockville, Maryland, for Appellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nHALL, Circuit Judge:\n\nJeffrey T. Rosen, who is deaf, sued Montgomery County, Mary-\nland, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nfor injuries suffered during and as a result of his arrest for drunk driv-\ning. The district court granted summary judgment to the County on\nall claims, and Rosen appealed. We affirm.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nIn 1994, Rosen was stopped by a County policeman for erratic\ndriving. He failed a field sobriety test and, after signing a consent\nform, failed a breath test. He was then arrested and taken to the sta-\ntion house, where he signed a form that explained his rights and gave\nconsent to a chemical test. The test registered a reading indicating a\nblood-alcohol content above the legal limit. He was then driven home.\nHe claims that the police made no attempt to communicate in writing\nand that they ignored his requests for an interpreter and for a TTY\ntelephone so he could call a lawyer.\n\nB\n\nRosen met with Donald McGean, a County employee, to discuss\nthe possibility of enrolling in REDDO,1 a diversionary program\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 REDDO is an acronym for \"Rehabilitation and Education for Drink-\ning Driver Offender.\" Under the REDDO program, the County refers\n\n                     2\n\foffered to first-time offenders. The County provided an interpreter for\nthis meeting. Rosen alleges that McGean told him that he (Rosen)\nwould have to provide his own interpreter for a local REDDO pro-\ngram or have the judge order the County to provide one, but that in\nany event the County would not pay for an interpreter. McGean testi-\nfied in a deposition that he was \"pretty sure\" that he told Rosen about\na private contractor, Family Service Foundation (FSF), that provided\na program to hearing-impaired persons in neighboring Prince\nGeorge's County. Rosen signed a form that stated that he agreed to\nparticipate in an \"alcohol education program,\" to which was added in\nhandwriting, \"in sign language.\" Rosen asserts that McGean never\ntold him about the FSF program.\n\nC\n\nWhen he appeared in state court to answer the drunk driving\ncharge, Rosen requested that the court order the County to provide an\ninterpreter so he could attend a REDDO program. The judge denied\nthe request, and Rosen pleaded guilty. He was given probation before\njudgment, fined, and ordered to attend six Alcoholics Anonymous\nmeetings as a condition of having his conviction expunged. Rosen did\nattend the AA meetings, though without an interpreter.\n\nII\n\nRosen brought his ADA claim2 under the \"public services\" sub-\nchapter, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. Section 12132 provides:\n_________________________________________________________________\nfirst-time offenders to various privately operated alcohol treatment and\neducation programs. The County does not run any such education pro-\ngrams itself. The cost of these programs to the clients is based on their\nincome.\n2 Rosen's Rehabilitation Act claims parallel the ADA claims. For con-\nvenience' sake, we combine the analysis of the two statutes. See Shafer\nv. Preston Memorial Hosp. Corp., 107 F.3d 274, 276 n.3 (4th Cir. 1997).\nRosen's § 1983 claim is that the County failed to adequately train its\npolice officers regarding the ADA's requirements and that this failure-to-\ntrain resulted in a denial of his due process and equal protection rights\nunder the 14th Amendment. We agree with the district court that this\nclaim hinges on, at the minimum, a ruling that Rosen's ADA rights were\nviolated.\n\n                    3\n\f          [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\n          of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be\n          denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of\n          a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any\n          such entity.\n\nThe County is a public entity within the meaning of§ 12131(a), and\nRosen has adduced sufficient evidence that he has a\"disability\" as\nthat term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Rosen's claim comprises\ntwo distinct parts, the arrest and the REDDO program.\n\nThe district court ruled that the ADA does not require the police\nto provide interpreters or TTY telephones to arrestees. In addition, the\ncourt found that the policemen were trained to communicate with deaf\npersons and, in any event, that the arresting officers reasonably\nthought that they could communicate with Rosen without auxiliary\naids.\n\nWith regard to the REDDO claim, the court ruled that Rosen had\ncreated no genuine dispute about two factual components. First, the\ncourt found that the County refers all hearing-impaired persons eligi-\nble for REDDO to FSF and that Rosen had been informed about the\nFSF program by McGean. Second, the court rejected Rosen's argu-\nment that the County was obligated to provide a REDDO program\n\"accommodating the time and location preferences of the Plaintiff.\"\n\nWe review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\nSee Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 863 F.2d 1162, 1167\n(4th Cir. 1988). We affirm the judgment below, though under an anal-\nysis that is slightly different in a few respects. See Shafer, 107 F.3d\nat 275 n.1 (\"We have consistently recognized that we may affirm a\ndistrict court's decision on different grounds than those employed by\nthe district court.\") (citations omitted). We will treat the arrest and\nREDDO portions of Rosen's claim separately.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 As a preliminary matter, we reject the County's first argument that\nthere is no respondeat superior liability under the ADA and that the\nCounty can only be held for a policy of discrimination. Under the ADA\nand similar statutes, liability may be imposed on a principal for the statu-\ntory violations of its agent. See, e.g., Birbeck v. Marvel Lighting Corp.,\n30 F.3d 507, 510-11 (4th Cir. 1994) (ADEA); EEOC v. AIC Sec. Investi-\ngations, Ltd., 55 F.3d 1276, 1279 (7th Cir. 1995) (ADA); Bonner v.\nLewis, 857 F.2d 559, 566-567 (9th Cir. 1988) (Rehabilitation Act).\n\n                    4\n\fIII\n\nIn his \"Statement of Material Facts in Dispute,\" filed in opposition\nto the County's motion for summary judgment, Rosen pointed out\nthat there remained factual disputes as to whether the police ignored\nhis requests for writing materials or an interpreter, whether he under-\nstood the policeman's instructions, and whether the police received\nadequate training in dealing with deaf persons. The claimed violation\nof the ADA is the failure of the police to have and use \"auxiliary aids\nand services\" on the street and at the stationhouse \"for use in stop-\nping, detaining and/or arresting individuals with hearing impair-\nments,\" and the claimed injury is the humiliation and embarrassment\nhe suffered by not being able to communicate with the police officers.\nAppellant's brief at 9. His argument is weak on a number of fronts.\n\nA\n\nThe most obvious problem is fitting an arrest into the ADA at all.\nSection 12131(b) defines \"[q]ualified individual with a disability\" as\n\"an individual with a disability who, with or without . . . the provision\nof auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility require-\nments for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or\nactivities provided by a public entity.\" Rosen clearly has a disability,\nbut calling a drunk driving arrest a \"program or activity\" of the\nCounty, the \"essential eligibility requirements\" of which (in this case)\nare weaving in traffic and being intoxicated, strikes us as a stretch of\nthe statutory language and of the underlying legislative intent. See\nGorman v. Bartch, 925 F.Supp. 653, 655 (W.D.Mo. 1996) (\"It\nstretches the statute to talk about the Plaintiff's`eligibility' to be\narrested and taken to jail or to participate in being arrested . . . .\"); cf.\nTorcasio v. Murray, 57 F.3d 1340, 1347 (4th Cir. 1995) (\"The terms\n`eligible' and `participate' imply voluntariness on the part of an appli-\ncant who seeks a benefit from the State; they do not bring to mind\nprisoners who are being held against their will.\"), cert. denied, 116\nS.Ct. 772 (1996).\n\nRosen points to nothing in the ADA itself or in the regulations that\nspecifically bring arrests within the ADA's ambit, despite the fact that\nsuch \"program or activity\" is one that is\"participated in\" by millions\nof persons every year. The closest he can come to an express inclu-\n\n                      5\n\fsion of arrests is a 1980 \"analysis of final rule,\" issued in conjunction\nwith the regulations under the Rehabilitation Act, that notes that \"law\nenforcement agencies should provide for the availability of qualified\ninterpreters to assist the agencies when dealing with hearing impaired\npersons.\" 45 Fed. Reg. 37629-30 (June 3, 1980). The analysis also\nnotes that Miranda warnings should be given on a written form\n\"where there is no qualified interpreter immediately available and\ncommunication is otherwise adequate\" and that a free interpreter\nshould be offered and interrogation deferred until one is obtained. Id.\nThese \"requirements\" are obviously aimed at complementing the con-\nstitutional protections that are aimed at insuring that confessions are\nvoluntarily and intelligently given. Rosen, however, does not contend\nthat his consent to the intoxication tests was the product of his inabil-\nity to understand the police.\n\nRosen was in no way \"denied the benefits of\" his arrest. As far as\nthe police officers were concerned, Rosen adequately participated in\nthe various tests for intoxication, and the officers obtained the infor-\nmation they needed to complete the booking process. Rosen was sim-\nply not \"discriminated against\" just because he could not follow\neverything the officers were telling him.\n\nIf we assume, however, that the police were required to provide\nauxiliary aids at some point in the process, that point certainly cannot\nbe placed before the arrival at the stationhouse. The police do not\nhave to get an interpreter before they can stop and shackle a fleeing\nbank robber, and they do not have to do so to stop a suspected drunk\ndriver, conduct a field sobriety test, and make an arrest.\n\nIf Rosen signed the consent forms because he felt, as he asserts in\nhis complaint, \"intimidated,\" the criminal justice system has ample\nprotections to guard against such pressures. For example, if a deaf\nindividual in Rosen's situation could demonstrate that the police\nfailed to communicate in certain material respects or that such failure\nto communicate constituted undue coercion, the evidence obtained\nmight well have to be suppressed in the context of any criminal\naction. Rosen is simply unable to point to any tangible adverse conse-\nquences resulting from the manner of his arrest. 4 Moreover, he does\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 A Department of Motor Vehicles administrative hearing officer dis-\nmissed the license revocation proceeding on the ground that the arresting\nofficers did not communicate with him effectively.\n\n                     6\n\fnot claim that the officers' refusal to use auxiliary aids led in any way\nto his guilty plea. Our decision to affirm, however, is based on an\neven more fundamental infirmity: the lack of any discernible injury.\n\nB\n\nWhat the policemen should have done is beside the point, unless\nRosen can show that he was somehow damaged by their failure to\ncommunicate. Rosen does not assert that better communication would\nhave changed events one iota, and, in the end, he is forced to fall back\non his claim that he was \"humiliated and embarrassed.\" But these are\nemotions experienced by almost every person stopped and arrested\nfor drunk driving. Rosen, who is a lawyer, failed a field test, signed\na form, failed another test, was arrested, signed another form, and\nfailed another test. Without some better indication of precisely what\nit was that he did not understand, we cannot find an injury that would\nsuffice to invoke the ADA's protections.\n\nIV\n\nThe other part of Rosen's ADA claim involves the County's\nalleged failure to provide interpreter services for the alcohol educa-\ntion programs or to inform him that alternative services were avail-\nable. This claim, however, evaporated before Rosen left the\ncourtroom where he was sentenced.\n\nThe evidence is that the County, including the police department,\nmade fairly extensive use of interpreters.5 Rosen's own evidence dem-\nonstrates that the FSF program was offered to other deaf persons prior\nto his discussion with McGean.6 Nevertheless, even if we assume that\nthere is a genuine issue of fact regarding what McGean told him or\ndid not tell him,7 the fact is not a material one. Again, we need first\nto determine what the violation and injury being claimed are.\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 For instance, in 1994, the year in which Rosen was arrested, the\nCounty spent $98,253 on interpreter services. J.A. 416.\n6 See deposition of Carol Rose Ethridge, J.A. 266, which was offered\nby Rosen in support of his summary judgment motion.\n7 The following factors throw doubt on Rosen's version. He met with\nMcGean for two hours with an interpreter, but the interpreter's version\n\n                     7\n\fRosen's argument seems to be that had the County provided a free\ninterpreter or, alternatively, had he at least known of the FSF pro-\ngram, he could have represented to the state court he was qualified for\na treatment program. The court then would have likely have placed\nhis case on the inactive docket for a year, after which time the case\nwould have been dismissed upon proof that he had completed the\ntreatment program. As it turned out, the court refused to order that the\nCounty provide an interpreter and instead required Rosen to attend\nAA meetings under a \"probation before judgment\" program. The end\nresult is essentially the same either way; he has no drunk driving\nrecord, and he makes no effort to explain how the legal consequences\ndiffer.\n\nRosen seems to be arguing that the ADA requires the County to\nprovide an interpreter at every privately operated education program\nthat is part of REDDO. See appellant's brief 27 (\"ADA requires the\nCounty to make its REDDO program accessible to deaf individuals.\").\nHowever, he has made no effort to show that FSF is segregated,\ninconvenient (or even less convenient), more expensive, or anyhow\ninferior to other REDDO programs operated in Montgomery County.\nTo the extent, then, that Rosen is insisting that the County be required\nto provide him with an interpreter so that he can participate in the par-\nticular program he desires, we have held that the Rehabilitation Act\nsays otherwise. See Barnett v. Fairfax County School Bd., 927 F.2d\n146, 154 (4th Cir. 1991) (school board not required to \"provide every\nhearing-impaired student with his interpreter of choice at his base\nschool, instead of at mainstreamed but centralized locations . . . . \").8\n_________________________________________________________________\nof what happened is not in the record. Prior to his meeting, he had spo-\nken to Mauro Ramos, a clinical supervisor at the County DWI Treatment\nServices Program, which administers the REDDO program. Ramos\nstated in a deposition that \"[a]t all times relevant herein, our office has\nprovided alcohol treatment and counseling to deaf and hearing impaired\nclients through [FSF].\" J.A. 418-19. Finally, Rosen worked with William\nEthridge, the father of a woman who had been arrested in 1993 for drunk\ndriving in the County and who had been offered the FSF program with\na counselor who could sign. J.A. 266; J.A. 272. It is difficult to believe\nthat not one of these people ever mentioned the FSF program to Rosen.\n8 At appellant's brief at 31, Rosen comments that \"disputed issues of\nfact exist as to the scope of the FSF program, its location, hours, cost,\n\n                    8\n\fThe only claim left would be that (1) McGean forgot to tell him\nabout FSF, therefore (2) he could not tell the court that he had been\naccepted into a program in which he could fully participate, and,\ntherefore, (3) he ended up at AA, where (4) he was denied the bene-\nfits of full and meaningful participation in some educational program.\nThis claim depends entirely on the unwarranted assumption that the\ncourt would have placed the case on the inactive docket and would\nhave required Rosen to attend either FSF as the diversionary program\n(had that program been brought to the court's attention) or another\nREDDO program for which the County was providing an interpreter.\n\nFinally, Rosen might be complaining about having to suffer the\nembarrassment of attending the court-ordered AA meetings without\nan interpreter. If this is the case, his claim would be against the court,\nan entity over which the County exercises no control whatsoever.\n\nV\n\nWith regard to the alleged ADA violations arising from the arrest,\nwe affirm because Rosen has failed to demonstrate that he was\ninjured by such violations. His REDDO-related claim fails because\nthe possibility of any ADA violation blossoming into a claim evapo-\nrated when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced by the state court.\n\nAFFIRMED\n_________________________________________________________________\nand accessibility to public transportation.\" However, in his \"Statement of\nDisputed Facts\", which was filed in opposition to the County's motion\nfor summary judgment, there is nothing about FSF's program. Neverthe-\nless, the record does contain basic information about the program. J.A.\n456-57.\n\n                     9\n\f\f",

The claimed violation\nof the ADA is the failure of the police to have and use \"auxiliary aids\nand services\" on the street and at the stationhouse \"for use in stop-\nping, detaining and/or arresting individuals with hearing impair-\nments,\" and the claimed injury is the humiliation and embarrassment\nhe suffered by not being able to communicate with the police officers.\nAppellant's brief at 9. His argument is weak on a number of fronts.\n\nA\n\nThe most obvious problem is fitting an arrest into the ADA at all.\nSection 12131(b) defines \"[q]ualified individual with a disability\" as\n\"an individual with a disability who, with or without . . . the provision\nof auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility require-\nments for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or\nactivities provided by a public entity.\" Rosen clearly has a disability,\nbut calling a drunk driving arrest a \"program or activity\" of the\nCounty, the \"essential eligibility requirements\" of which (in this case)\nare weaving in traffic and being intoxicated, strikes us as a stretch of\nthe statutory language and of the underlying legislative intent.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996).\n\nRosen points to nothing in the ADA itself or in the regulations that\nspecifically bring arrests within the ADA's ambit, despite the fact that\nsuch \"program or activity\" is one that is\"participated in\" by millions\nof persons every year. The closest he can come to an express inclu-\n\n                      5\n\fsion of arrests is a 1980 \"analysis of final rule,\" issued in conjunction\nwith the regulations under the Rehabilitation Act, that notes that \"law\nenforcement agencies should provide for the availability of qualified\ninterpreters to assist the agencies when dealing with hearing impaired\npersons.\" 45 Fed. Reg. 37629-30 (June 3, 1980). The analysis also\nnotes that Miranda warnings should be given on a written form\n\"where there is no qualified interpreter immediately available and\ncommunication is otherwise adequate\" and that a free interpreter\nshould be offered and interrogation deferred until one is obtained. Id.\nThese \"requirements\" are obviously aimed at complementing the con-\nstitutional protections that are aimed at insuring that confessions are\nvoluntarily and intelligently given. Rosen, however, does not contend\nthat his consent to the intoxication tests was the product of his inabil-\nity to understand the police.\n\nRosen was in no way \"denied the benefits of\" his arrest. As far as\nthe police officers were concerned, Rosen adequately participated in\nthe various tests for intoxication, and the officers obtained the infor-\nmation they needed to complete the booking process. Rosen was sim-\nply not \"discriminated against\" just because he could not follow\neverything the officers were telling him.\n\nIf we assume, however, that the police were required to provide\nauxiliary aids at some point in the process, that point certainly cannot\nbe placed before the arrival at the stationhouse. The police do not\nhave to get an interpreter before they can stop and shackle a fleeing\nbank robber, and they do not have to do so to stop a suspected drunk\ndriver, conduct a field sobriety test, and make an arrest.\n\nIf Rosen signed the consent forms because he felt, as he asserts in\nhis complaint, \"intimidated,\" the criminal justice system has ample\nprotections to guard against such pressures. For example, if a deaf\nindividual in Rosen's situation could demonstrate that the police\nfailed to communicate in certain material respects or that such failure\nto communicate constituted undue coercion, the evidence obtained\nmight well have to be suppressed in the context of any criminal\naction. Rosen is simply unable to point to any tangible adverse conse-\nquences resulting from the manner of his arrest. 4 Moreover, he does\n_________________________________________________________________\n4 A Department of Motor Vehicles administrative hearing officer dis-\nmissed the license revocation proceeding on the ground that the arresting\nofficers did not communicate with him effectively.\n\n                     6\n\fnot claim that the officers' refusal to use auxiliary aids led in any way\nto his guilty plea. Our decision to affirm, however, is based on an\neven more fundamental infirmity: the lack of any discernible injury.\n\nB\n\nWhat the policemen should have done is beside the point, unless\nRosen can show that he was somehow damaged by their failure to\ncommunicate. Rosen does not assert that better communication would\nhave changed events one iota, and, in the end, he is forced to fall back\non his claim that he was \"humiliated and embarrassed.\" But these are\nemotions experienced by almost every person stopped and arrested\nfor drunk driving. Rosen, who is a lawyer, failed a field test, signed\na form, failed another test, was arrested, signed another form, and\nfailed another test. Without some better indication of precisely what\nit was that he did not understand, we cannot find an injury that would\nsuffice to invoke the ADA's protections.\n\nIV\n\nThe other part of Rosen's ADA claim involves the County's\nalleged failure to provide interpreter services for the alcohol educa-\ntion programs or to inform him that alternative services were avail-\nable. This claim, however, evaporated before Rosen left the\ncourtroom where he was sentenced.\n\nThe evidence is that the County, including the police department,\nmade fairly extensive use of interpreters.5 Rosen's own evidence dem-\nonstrates that the FSF program was offered to other deaf persons prior\nto his discussion with McGean.6 Nevertheless, even if we assume that\nthere is a genuine issue of fact regarding what McGean told him or\ndid not tell him,7 the fact is not a material one. Again, we need first\nto determine what the violation and injury being claimed are.\n_________________________________________________________________\n5 For instance, in 1994, the year in which Rosen was arrested, the\nCounty spent $98,253 on interpreter services. J.A. 416.\n6 See deposition of Carol Rose Ethridge, J.A. 266, which was offered\nby Rosen in support of his summary judgment motion.\n7 The following factors throw doubt on Rosen's version. He met with\nMcGean for two hours with an interpreter, but the interpreter's version\n\n                     7\n\fRosen's argument seems to be that had the County provided a free\ninterpreter or, alternatively, had he at least known of the FSF pro-\ngram, he could have represented to the state court he was qualified for\na treatment program. The court then would have likely have placed\nhis case on the inactive docket for a year, after which time the case\nwould have been dismissed upon proof that he had completed the\ntreatment program. As it turned out, the court refused to order that the\nCounty provide an interpreter and instead required Rosen to attend\nAA meetings under a \"probation before judgment\" program. The end\nresult is essentially the same either way; he has no drunk driving\nrecord, and he makes no effort to explain how the legal consequences\ndiffer.\n\nRosen seems to be arguing that the ADA requires the County to\nprovide an interpreter at every privately operated education program\nthat is part of REDDO. See appellant's brief 27 (\"ADA requires the\nCounty to make its REDDO program accessible to deaf individuals.\").\nHowever, he has made no effort to show that FSF is segregated,\ninconvenient (or even less convenient), more expensive, or anyhow\ninferior to other REDDO programs operated in Montgomery County.\nTo the extent, then, that Rosen is insisting that the County be required\nto provide him with an interpreter so that he can participate in the par-\nticular program he desires, we have held that the Rehabilitation Act\nsays otherwise. See Barnett v. Fairfax County School Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556661\"><a href=\"/opinion/556661/michael-w-barnett-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-james-e-and-cynthia-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 (4th Cir. 1991) (school board not required to \"provide every\nhearing-impaired student with his interpreter of choice at his base\nschool, instead of at mainstreamed but centralized locations . . . . \").8\n_________________________________________________________________\nof what happened is not in the record. Prior to his meeting, he had spo-\nken to Mauro Ramos, a clinical supervisor at the County DWI Treatment\nServices Program, which administers the REDDO program. Ramos\nstated in a deposition that \"[a]t all times relevant herein, our office has\nprovided alcohol treatment and counseling to deaf and hearing impaired\nclients through [FSF].\" J.A. 418-19. Finally, Rosen worked with William\nEthridge, the father of a woman who had been arrested in 1993 for drunk\ndriving in the County and who had been offered the FSF program with\na counselor who could sign. J.A. 266; J.A. 272. It is difficult to believe\nthat not one of these people ever mentioned the FSF program to Rosen.\n8 At appellant's brief at 31, Rosen comments that \"disputed issues of\nfact exist as to the scope of the FSF program, its location, hours, cost,\n\n                    8\n\fThe only claim left would be that (1) McGean forgot to tell him\nabout FSF, therefore (2) he could not tell the court that he had been\naccepted into a program in which he could fully participate, and,\ntherefore, (3) he ended up at AA, where (4) he was denied the bene-\nfits of full and meaningful participation in some educational program.\nThis claim depends entirely on the unwarranted assumption that the\ncourt would have placed the case on the inactive docket and would\nhave required Rosen to attend either FSF as the diversionary program\n(had that program been brought to the court's attention) or another\nREDDO program for which the County was providing an interpreter.\n\nFinally, Rosen might be complaining about having to suffer the\nembarrassment of attending the court-ordered AA meetings without\nan interpreter. If this is the case, his claim would be against the court,\nan entity over which the County exercises no control whatsoever.\n\nV\n\nWith regard to the alleged ADA violations arising from the arrest,\nwe affirm because Rosen has failed to demonstrate that he was\ninjured by such violations. His REDDO-related claim fails because\nthe possibility of any ADA violation blossoming into a claim evapo-\nrated when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced by the state court.\n\nAFFIRMED\n_________________________________________________________________\nand accessibility to public transportation.\" However, in his \"Statement of\nDisputed Facts\", which was filed in opposition to the County's motion\nfor summary judgment, there is nothing about FSF's program. Neverthe-\nless, the record does contain basic information about the program. J.A.\n456-57.\n\n                     9\n\f\f</pre>",
