Civil Action No. 87-3349 (CKK)\n U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY, et al.,\n\n    Defendants.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                                     (January 18, 2017)\n\n       Carl Oglesby filed suit in 1987 challenging several agencies’ responses to a Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request Mr. Oglesby submitted in August 1985. It is now 2017. Over\n\nthe past twenty years, this case has gone through numerous rounds of summary judgment briefing\n\nand reached the United States Court of Appeals three times. Mr. Ogelsby himself died in 2011,\n\nbut his daughter and the administrator of his estate have since been substituted as Plaintiffs and\n\ncontinue his efforts. After a very limited remand from the Court of Appeals in 2015, the latest\n\nround of cross-motions for summary judgment are currently before the Court.\n\n       Upon consideration of the pleadings, 1 the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a\n\nwhole, the Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all remaining\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The Court’s analysis has focused on the following documents: Defs.’ Renewed Mot. for\nSumm. J. (“Defs.’ Mot.”), ECF No. [327]; Pls.’ Renewed Mot. for Partial Summ. J. and Other\nRelief and Reply to Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Partial Summ. J. and Other Relief (“Pls.’ Mot.”),\nECF No. [330]; Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Renewed Mot. for Partial Summ. J. and Reply in Support of\nDefs.’ Renewed Mot. for Summ. J. (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. [335]; Pls.’ Reply to Defs.’ Opp’n\nto Second Renewed Mot. for Partial Summ. J., Etc. (“Pls.’ Reply”), ECF No. [339]. In an exercise\nof its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action would not be of assistance\nin rendering a decision. See LCvR 7(f).\n\fissues. The Court finds that Defendants have satisfied their burden of showing that the minimal\n\nredactions made to the documents that were released to Plaintiffs during the latest appeal are\n\njustified under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3. The Court also rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that the\n\ndocuments produced during the appeal indicate that any Defendant has not completed an adequate\n\nsearch for responsive documents. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ [327] Renewed\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment and DENIES Plaintiffs’ [330] Renewed Motion for Partial\n\nSummary Judgment and Other Relief.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Since the early 1970s, [Carl] Oglesby has relentlessly pursued the story of General\n       Reinhard Gehlen, who served as chief of a Nazi spy ring during World War II and\n       who allegedly later negotiated an agreement with the United States which allowed\n       his spy network to continue in existence despite post-war de-nazification programs.\n       After World War II, his group, then known as the Gehlen Organization, was\n       reportedly reconstituted as a functioning espionage network under U.S. command.\n       According to Oglesby, control of the Gehlen Organization shifted back to the\n       newly-sovereign West German Federal Republic as the BND (for\n       Bundesnachrichtendienst, or “the Federal Intelligence Service”) after ten years of\n       U.S. control.\n\nOglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army (“Oglesby II”), 79 F.3d 1172, 1175 (D.C. Cir. 1996). 2 To that end,\n\nbetween August 21 and September 19, 1985, Carl Oglesby submitted nearly identical Freedom of\n\nInformation Act requests to the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States Departments of the\n\nArmy and State, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”). See Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army\n\n(“Oglesby I”), 920 F.2d 57, 60 (D.C. Cir. 1990). “[W]ith minor variations,” Oglesby sought the\n\nfollowing records from each agency:\n\n\n       2\n         Given the lengthy proceedings in this case to date, the background of this case has been\ndescribed in a number of prior opinions. The Court sees no reason to reinvent the wheel here.\nAccordingly, the first portion of the background section in this Memorandum Opinion is largely\nderived from the Court’s September 26, 2013 Memorandum Opinion.\n                                                2\n\f       (1) records on General Gehlen during the period 1944 through 1956;\n\n       (2) records on meetings held at Fort Hunt, Virginia, in the summer of 1945 between\n       General Gehlen and U.S. Army General George Strong and Office of Strategic\n       Services (“OSS”) officer Allen Dulles;\n\n       (3) records on the U.S. Army’s “Operation Rusty,” carried out in Europe between\n       1945 and 1948;\n\n       (4) records on post-war Nazi German underground organizations such as “Odessa,”\n       “Kamaradenwerk,” “Bruderschaft,” “Werewolves” and “Die Spinne”;\n\n       (5) records on the OSS’s “Operation Sunrise” carried out in 1945; and\n\n       (6) records on Gehlen’s relationship with William J. Donovan and Allen Dulles of\n       the OSS, records on Operation Rusty and Gehlen collected by the Central\n       Intelligence Group (“CIG”), and records on the Nazi underground organization “La\n       Arana.”\n\nId. The agencies released a total of 384 pages, many with redactions, and withheld other\n\nresponsive documents. Id. The Army, CIA, NARA, and NSA denied Mr. Oglesby’s request for\n\na fee waiver. Id. at 61.\n\n       Mr. Oglesby filed suit on December 11, 1987. The District Court, per Judge Norma\n\nHolloway Johnson, granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants. 5/22/1989 Mem. Op.\n\n& Order. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit found that Oglesby had failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies with respect to his requests to the Army, CIA, FBI, NSA, and NARA, but had\n\nconstructively exhausted his administrative remedies concerning his request to the Department of\n\nState. Oglesby I, 920 F.2d at 59-60. The court remanded the case, instructing Oglesby to exhaust\n\nhis remedies, and leaving for the District Court the issue of whether the Department of State\n\nconducted an adequate search in response to Oglesby’s request. Id.\n\n       Following the Oglesby I decision, Oglesby exhausted his administrative remedies, and once\n\nagain challenged the Defendants’ responses. Oglesby II, 79 F.3d at 1176. The District Court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants, concluding that each Defendant agency\n\n                                               3\n\fconducted an adequate search for documents and properly withheld information pursuant to\n\nvarious FOIA exemptions. Id. Mr. Oglesby appealed, challenging (1) NARA’s refusal to grant\n\nOglesby a fee waiver; (2) the adequacy of the searches conducted by the Army, CIA, FBI, NSA,\n\nand State Department; (3) the adequacy of the Vaughn indices submitted by the Army, CIA, and\n\nNSA; and (4) the CIA’s and Army’s withholding of certain responsive documents. Id. at 1175.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit agreed that the CIA and the Army failed to show that they conducted adequate\n\nsearches, and that the CIA, Army, and NSA failed to adequately justify their withholdings. Id.\n\nThe court affirmed the District Court in all other respects. Id. Upon remand, the Army, CIA, and\n\nNSA eventually filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. 9/25/97 Mot. for Summ. J., ECF\n\nNo. [129]. Just short of one year later, Oglesby filed an opposition to the Defendants’ motion and\n\ncross-moved for summary judgment. 9/14/98 Cross Mot., ECF No. [176].3\n\n       On October 8, 1998, President William Clinton signed into law the “Nazi War Crimes\n\nDisclosure Act,” or “NWCDA.” P.L. 105-246, 5 U.S.C. § 552 note. The act “required the U.S.\n\nGovernment to locate, declassify, and release in their entirety, with few exceptions, remaining\n\nclassified records about war crimes committed by Nazi Germany and its allies.” Nazi War Crimes\n\n& Japanese Imperial Gov’t Records Interagency Working Group, Final Report to the United States\n\nCongress 1 (Apr. 2007), ECF No. [244-1] (“Final Report”). To oversee the implementation of\n\nNWCDA and the Japanese-Imperial Government Disclosure Act of 2000, the President created an\n\nInteragency Working Group (“IWG” or “the working group”), consisting of the Archivist of the\n\nUnited States, designated representatives of the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Council, the\n\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Departments of Defense, Justice, and State, as well as\n\n\n       3\n          Pleadings and orders submitted prior to 2006 are not on the electronic docket, but can be\nlocated in the case file maintained by the Clerk of Court.\n\n                                                4\n\fthree public members. Id. Although General Gehlen is not considered a Nazi war criminal, “the\n\nCIA pledged to acknowledge the intelligence relationship with General Gehlen in records\n\nprocessed for release under the [NWCDA].” Id. at 48. Accordingly, “the CIA approved the release\n\nof the 2,100-page Army Gehlen file, and in addition released nearly 2,100 pages of materials\n\nrelating to Gehlen from its own files as well as files on many of Gehlen’s personnel and agents—\n\nincluding the operational information in all of these files.” Id.\n\n        While the parties’ cross-motions were pending, the Defendants submitted a declaration\n\nfrom William H. McNair, the Information Review Officer for the Directorate of Operations for the\n\nCIA, indicating that the Director of Central Intelligence declassified the relationship between the\n\nUnited States Government and the Gehlen Organization. Decl. of William H. McNair, ECF No.\n\n[242-1], at ¶ 9. In light of the declassification, the CIA indicated it needed to reprocess its previous\n\nreleases to Oglesby and its referrals to the CIA from other agencies “because additional\n\ninformation may now be appropriate for release.” 10/31/00 Status Report, ECF No. [211], at 3.\n\nUnsure of what effect the declassification might have on the Defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment with respect to the NSA and the Army, the Defendants withdrew the pending motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Id. at 6. Oglesby noted that his cross-motion may also be moot due to the\n\nclassification.   11/17/00 Order, ECF No. [214], at 2.          The Court accordingly ordered the\n\nDefendants to file a status report by no later than December 11, 2000, indicating “how much time\n\nis needed to complete its review of responsive material” and “how much time is needed to prepare\n\nand file a Vaughn declaration and accompanying motion for summary judgment.” Id.\n\n        Pursuant to the Court’s November 2000 Order, the Defendants submitted a status report\n\nindicating that “recent CIA searches conducted in response to the portion of the plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequest regarding General Gehlen have resulted in locating approximately 251 boxes of material,\n\n                                                   5\n\fand 2,901 folders, with documents that likely contain records regarding General Gehlen.” 4\n\n12/11/00 Status Report, ECF No. [215], at 1-2. The Defendants explained that “CIA reviewers\n\nprocessing documents for release under the NWCDA [would] be most familiar with the material\n\nat issue in plaintiff’s FOIA request,” therefore the CIA proposed “incorporat[ing] the processing\n\nof plaintiff’s FOIA request into the processing of the documents to be reviewed pursuant to the\n\nNWCDA.” Id. at 2. The Defendants suggested this approach would benefit Mr. Oglesby because\n\n“the CIA [would] release responsive documents to the plaintiff as they [were] released under the\n\nNWCDA, instead of waiting until all documents are processed,” as was the CIA’s general\n\nprocedure in FOIA cases. Id. The Defendants estimated that the processing of all responsive\n\ndocuments under the NWCDA would be completed “within a year,” but that “additional\n\ndocuments that go beyond the scope of the Act—which the CIA anticipates locating—will also\n\nneed to be processed.” Id. Accordingly, the CIA requested two years in which to complete its\n\nreview of documents and to file a Vaughn index. Id. at 3. The parties discussed many of the issues\n\nraised in the Defendants’ status report during a status hearing on January 9, 2001. Noting that\n\nmany of the documents were likely to be in German and thus need translating before processing,\n\nthe Court asked the Defendants to submit a further status report in approximately three weeks.\n\n1/9/01 Tr. 18:21-19:2. The Court anticipated that the Defendants would file additional status\n\nreports as the documents were being processed, but advised Plaintiffs’ counsel that if he was\n\ndissatisfied with the pace at which documents were reviewed or produced, he should contact the\n\nCourt and request another status hearing. Id. 20:15-21.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         During the status hearing on January 9, 2001, the Defendants estimated that the 251\nboxes might contain between 251,000 and 775,000 pages of material. 1/9/01 Tr. 4:15-23.\n                                             6\n\f       In a further status report submitted on February 5, 2001, the Defendants explained that the\n\nCIA had identified “numerous code words associated with Gehlen and the Gehlen Organization,\n\nand conducted a search of the applicable records systems using these code words,” identifying “a\n\npotential universe of over 25,000 responsive documents.” 2/5/01 Status Report, ECF No. [216] at\n\n2. The CIA intended to conduct another search “within the next two months” using additional\n\nsearch terms. Id. at 3-4. The agency estimated that the review of all potentially responsive\n\ndocuments, including referrals to other agencies as necessary, would take two years to complete,\n\n“but because of the many variables, the CIA suggest[ed] that it provide interim status reports on\n\nthe CIA’s Progress every four to six months.” Id. at 4. The Court did not issue any orders in\n\nresponse to the February 2001 status report. In fact, between February 2001 and December 2011,\n\nneither party submitted any documentation to the Court, save notice of change of addresses for\n\ncounsel and notices of substitution of counsel for the Defendants.\n\n       Nearly eleven years after the Defendants’ last status report, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to\n\nsubstitute Ms. DiBacco and Ms. Webster as Plaintiffs, which Judge James E. Boasberg granted in\n\nhis capacity as the motions Judge. 12/1/11 Mot., ECF No. [224]; 1/5/12 Minute Order. The\n\nPlaintiffs then moved to compel the Defendants to, among other things, describe the searches\n\nconducted for potentially responsive documents, provide copies of all draft status reports created\n\nafter February 2001, provide copies of all Vaughn indices submitted to the Plaintiffs since February\n\n2001, “[l]ist and provide copies of all correspondence which was sent to Carl Oglesby or his\n\nattorney regarding this case subsequent to the February 5, 2001 status report,” and “[l]ist and\n\nprovide copies of all records released pursuant to this lawsuit subsequent to the February 5, 2001\n\nstatus report.” Pls.’ Mot. to Compel, ECF No. [227]. Once the Plaintiffs’ motion was fully briefed,\n\nthe case was randomly reassigned to the undersigned. 5/30/12 Reassignment of Civil Case, ECF\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. [237]. The Court promptly denied the Plaintiffs’ motion to compel, and ordered the parties to\n\nsubmit a proposed briefing schedule for dispositive motions. 5/30/12 Minute Order.\n\n       The parties then filed and briefed new cross motions for summary judgment.             On\n\nSeptember 26, 2013, the Court granted Defendants’ [240] Renewed Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and denied Plaintiffs’ [241] Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. 9/26/2013 Order,\n\nECF No. [256]. The Court held that Defendants had met their burden of showing, through detailed\n\ndeclarations and Vaughn indices, that the CIA and the Army conducted adequate searches for\n\nresponsive records, and that the NSA, the CIA, and the Army properly withheld certain\n\ninformation pursuant to various FOIA exemptions. 9/26/2013 Mem. Op., ECF No. [257], at 2.\n\n       Plaintiffs appealed this Court’s decision, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. DiBacco v.\n\nU.S. Army, 795 F.3d 178 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The Court of Appeals agreed that the Army had\n\nconducted an adequate search for responsive records. Id. at 188-92. It also rejected Plaintiffs’\n\nargument that summary judgment was not proper because the Army had transferred responsive\n\ndocuments to NARA, finding that the Army had transferred those documents in order “to fulfill\n\nthe Army’s obligations under the Disclosure Act,” not to evade its FOIA obligations. Id. at 192.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also found that the CIA had conducted an adequate search for records under\n\nFOIA, id. at 195, and had satisfied its burden of showing that it had properly withheld certain\n\ninformation pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, id. at 195-99.\n\n       However, the Court of Appeals remanded the case back to this Court “to address in the first\n\ninstance DiBacco’s and Webster’s challenges to redactions in a batch of records that the Army\n\ndisclosed to them while this appeal was pending.” Id. at 183. At oral argument, Plaintiffs argued\n\nthat the Army’s transfer of its records to NARA deprived Plaintiffs of the benefit of the Army’s\n\nfee waiver for their FOIA requests. Defs.’ Stmt. of Material Facts as to Which There is No\n\n                                                8\n\fGenuine Issue, ECF No. [327] (“Defs.’ Stmt.”) at ¶ 10; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. of Material Facts\n\nNot in Genuine Dispute, ECF No. [332] (“Pls.’ Resp.”) at ¶ 10. The Court of Appeals asked\n\nPlaintiffs’ counsel to identify any NARA documents the contents of which counsel did not know.\n\nDefs.’ Stmt. ¶ 13; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 13. Plaintiffs’ counsel identified documents\n\nreferenced in paragraph 17 of a declaration from NARA’s Chief of Special Access and Freedom\n\nof Information Act Branch, Research Services, Martha Wagner Murphy.               Id.   Defendants\n\nrepresented to the Court of Appeals that arrangements would be made to provide to Plaintiffs a\n\ncopy of those documents. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 15; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 15. A copy of those\n\ndocuments was eventually provided, but the Court of Appeals noted in its Opinion that some of\n\nthe documents “were redacted or indicated that pages had been removed, with no accompanying\n\njustification for that withholding of information.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 194. The Court of Appeals\n\n“accordingly remand[ed] to allow the parties to create a record and the district court to decide in\n\nthe first instance the narrow question of whether those withholdings were permissible under\n\nFOIA.” Id. The Court of Appeals expressed that the “remand is limited to issues arising from the\n\nArmy’s release to DiBacco during the appeal of responsive but redacted Army documents that had\n\nbeen held by the National Archives.” Id. at 200.\n\n       There are a total of 2,863 pages of digitized records discussed in paragraph 17 of Ms.\n\nMurphy’s declaration. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 26; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 26. Of those 2,863,\n\nDefendants had originally made redactions to 11 pages pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3.\n\nDefs.’ Stmt. ¶¶ 25, 28; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶¶ 25, 28.

Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 33; Pls.’ Resp.\n\nto Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 33.\n\n       Following the Court of Appeals’ remand, on October 21, 2015, the Court ordered the\n\nparties to meet and confer and to file a joint status report regarding how they proposed proceeding\n\nin this matter. 10/21/2015 Order, ECF No. [277]. The parties did so, and subsequently filed and\n\nbriefed a new round of cross-motions for summary judgment. Those cross-motions are now fully\n\nbriefed and ripe for resolution.\n\n                                    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, in order to “pierce the\n\nveil of administrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.” Dep’t of\n\nAir Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976) (citation omitted). Congress remained sensitive to\n\nthe need to achieve balance between these objectives and the potential that “legitimate\n\ngovernmental and private interests could be harmed by release of certain types of information.”\n\nCritical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 975 F.2d 871, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1992)\n\n(en banc) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 984 (1993). To that end, FOIA “requires federal\n\nagencies to make Government records available to the public, subject to nine exemptions for\n\ncategories of material.” Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 131 S.Ct. 1259, 1261-62 (2011). Ultimately,\n\n“disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the act.” Rose, 425 U.S. at 361. For this\n\nreason, the “exemptions are explicitly made exclusive, and must be narrowly construed.” Milner,\n\n131 S.Ct. at 1262 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f       When presented with a motion for summary judgment in this context, the district court\n\nmust conduct a “de novo” review of the record, which requires the court to “ascertain whether the\n\nagency has sustained its burden of demonstrating that the documents requested . . . are exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under the FOIA.” Multi Ag. Media LLC v. Dep’t of Agriculture, 515 F.3d 1224,\n\n1227 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). The burden is on the agency to justify its response to the\n\nplaintiff’s request. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). “An agency may sustain its burden by means of\n\naffidavits, but only if they contain reasonable specificity of detail rather than merely conclusory\n\nstatements, and if they are not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record or by\n\nevidence of agency bad faith.” Multi Ag Media, 515 F.3d at 1227 (citation omitted). “If an\n\nagency’s affidavit describes the justifications for withholding the information with specific detail,\n\ndemonstrates that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not\n\ncontradicted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of the agency’s bad faith, then\n\nsummary judgment is warranted on the basis of the affidavit alone.” Am. Civil Liberties Union v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Defense, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). “Uncontradicted,\n\nplausible affidavits showing reasonable specificity and a logical relation to the exemption are\n\nlikely to prevail.” Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 641 F.3d 504, 509 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2011) (citation omitted). Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, the discovery\n\nmaterials on file, and any affidavits or declarations “show[] that there is no genuine dispute as to\n\nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\nWith these principles in mind, the Court turns to the merits of the parties’ cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f                                        III. DISCUSSION\n\n       The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment cover two main areas of dispute: (A)\n\nwhether the Army has conducted an adequate search for records and (B) whether the redactions\n\nDefendants made to the Army records released to Plaintiffs during the course of the latest appeal\n\nwere proper under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\n\nboth issues. The Court will address each in turn, and then (C) conclude by addressing certain\n\nmiscellaneous points raised in the parties’ briefs.\n\nA. Adequacy of the Army’s Search for Records\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the records released during the latest appeal show that the Army—in\n\nconjunction with NARA—has not conducted an adequate search for records responsive to\n\nOglesby’s FOIA requests. 5 “In order to obtain summary judgment the agency must show that it\n\nmade a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can\n\nbe reasonably expected to produce the information requested.” Oglesby I, 920 F.2d at 68. “[T]he\n\nissue to be resolved is not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to\n\nthe request, but rather whether the search for those documents was adequate.” Weisberg v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (emphasis in original). “In determining\n\nthe adequacy of a FOIA search, the Court is guided by principles of reasonableness.” Riccardi v.\n\nUnited States Dep’t of Justice, 32 F. Supp. 3d 59, 63 (D.D.C. 2014).\n\n       Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this issue. This Court has already\n\nanalyzed the more-than-reasonable search for records undertaken by the Army, in conjunction with\n\n\n       5\n        NARA is no longer a defendant in this case, but the Army has transferred its records\nthat would be responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests to NARA, who has accepted full\nresponsibility for them and “conducted the most recent searches of those files for records\nresponsive to Oglesby’s FOIA request.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 189-90.\n\n                                                 12\n\fNARA, and determined that it was adequate for the purposes of FOIA. DiBacco, 983 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 62-64. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals. DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 188-92. The\n\nCourt will not repeat that analysis here, although it incorporates it by reference into this\n\nMemorandum Opinion. It is sufficient for the purposes of the pending cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment to state that nothing in the records produced to Plaintiffs during the course of the latest\n\nappeal of this case undermines the Court’s previous conclusions with respect to the adequacy of\n\nthose searches. 6\n\n        First, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ contention that the presence of “Top Secret\n\nReplacement Sheets” in the recently-provided Army records shows that Defendants have not\n\nconducted an adequate search. These “Replacement Sheets” indicate that certain “Top Secret”\n\ndocuments were removed from the records Defendants were able to locate in the immediate\n\naftermath of World War II, roughly 70 years ago. Decl. of Joanne Benear, ECF No. [327-1]\n\n(“Benear Decl.”), at ¶¶ 11-12. These records were microfilmed at the Army’s Counter\n\nIntelligence Corps in Europe at that time. Id. Defendants now avow that, regardless of what\n\nPlaintiffs refer to as the “plethora of information” on these sheets, Pls.’ Mot. at 37, Defendants\n\ndo not know where these documents might have been taken or stored so many years ago, or\n\nwhere, so many years later, they could even begin looking for them beyond the locations they\n\nhave already searched. Benear Decl. at ¶ 14. The Court finds this claim reasonable. Although\n\n“there may be times when an agency’s inability to retrieve documents known or thought to be in\n\n\n\n        6\n          The Court notes that, as part of their argument that the Army has not conducted\nadequate searches, Plaintiffs request the Court “consider using its discretion to conduct in\ncamera review of a selected sample of the records that remain withheld” and “appoint a Special\nMaster.” Pls.’ Mot. at 42-43; see also Pls.’ Reply at 15. Because the Court herein rejects\nPlaintiffs’ attempts to challenge the adequacy of the Army’s searches, and reaffirms its finding\nthat adequate searches have been conducted, the Court will take neither of these steps.\n                                                   13\n\fits files is inherently unbelievable,” Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1983), given the considerable amount of years that have passed since these documents were\n\nmicrofilmed, this is not one of those times.\n\n       Regardless of whether Defendants can say definitively what particular documents were\n\nreplaced by these “Replacement Sheets,” whether those documents still exist, or where those\n\ndocuments are, the relevant question remains, as in all FOIA cases, merely whether the Army has\n\nconducted an adequate search for responsive documents. As the Court of Appeals has\n\nconcluded, “[t]he declarations from the Army and the National Archives describe searches of\n\nArmy records reasonably calculated to discover all documents responsive to Oglesby’s request,”\n\nand, in fact, “[t]hose searches have looked further and wider than FOIA requires.” DiBacco, 795\n\nF.3d at 191. Accordingly, if the documents replaced by these “Replacement Sheets” still exist,\n\nand if they are in fact responsive to Oglesby’s FOIA requests, the Army presumably would have\n\nfound them in its searches, which it has declared covered all “locations that might contain\n\nresponsive records.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 190. This is all FOIA requires of the Army. 7\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs argue that the production of the 2,863 pages at issue here indicates an\n\ninadequate search because “[t]here were 9,000 Army records that were produced before year\n\n2000.” Pls.’ Mot. at 41-42. Plaintiffs argue that “the Army and NARA need to account for why\n\nthese records have not been given to DiBacco as part of the NWCDA release.” Id. at 42.\n\nDefendants have, however, accounted for this perceived discrepancy. The reason why Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         To the extent Plaintiffs contend Defendants have any additional duty to produce these\ndocuments simply because they were referenced in the records produced to Plaintiffs, they are\nwrong. “[O]ur Court of Appeals has made clear that agencies do not need to examine every\ncrossreferenced document uncovered after an initial disclosure.” Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v.\nUnited States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 117 F. Supp. 3d 46, 58 (D.D.C. 2015).\n                                               14\n\fwere only provided 2,863 pages in this latest production is because the files referenced in\n\nparagraph 17 of Martha Wagner Murphy’s declaration, which were the records provided to\n\nPlaintiffs during the latest appeal and the only records at issue here, consisted only of digitized\n\nfiles. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 22; Decl. of Martha Wagner Murphy, ECF No. [240-2] (“Murphy Decl.”), at\n\n¶¶ 12-17. Digitized files constituted only a small portion of the overall universe of Army records\n\nthat were transferred to NARA, Final Report at 52-54, and the 9,000 records referenced by\n\nPlaintiffs apparently were not limited to digitized files. Accordingly, the discrepancy\n\nhighlighted by Plaintiffs has been explained, is justified, and is not a reason to deny summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Army needs to run additional searches because “[t]he\n\nGovernment has conceded that Army had a copy, indeed multiple copies” of records that it\n\ntransferred to NARA. Pls.’ Mot. at 42. This is also not a reason to deny summary judgment on\n\nthe search issue. Apparently the Army did keep a copy of the documents it had selected as\n\nresponsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests at a much earlier stage in this litigation, before\n\ntransferring all of its original Investigative Records Repository (“IRR”) records to NARA.\n\nDefs.’ Stmt. ¶¶ 17-18; Pls.’ Ex. 5, ECF No. [330-5] (December 19, 2014 Letter from Ronald C.\n\nMachen Jr. to Mark J. Langer); Benear Decl. ¶¶ 5-6 . But this fact is of no help to Plaintiffs. If\n\nall that the Army has maintained is a copy of the set of documents it already located and\n\ndetermined were responsive to Oglesby’s requests, there are no additional original documents for\n\nthe Army to search.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs raise a number of challenges that do not appear to relate in any way to\n\nthe release of redacted Army records during the latest appeal, and are accordingly outside of the\n\nscope of the remand in this case. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants should have searched certain\n\n                                                 15\n\f“dossiers” listed in a book written by Linda Hunt, that NARA has not searched for certain\n\nproject files or archival materials stored in Arlington, Virginia, and that “it is unclear whether the\n\nCIA has ever accounted for” certain materials the FBI referred to the CIA “when the FBI was\n\nstill active in this case.” Pls.’ Mot. at 38. The Court need not resolve these arguments. The\n\nCourt of Appeals’ mandate to this Court stated that “[t]he remand is limited to the issues arising\n\nfrom the Army’s release to DiBacco during the appeal of responsive but redacted Army\n\ndocuments that had been held by the National Archives.” Mandate, ECF No. [275]. Because\n\nthese miscellaneous arguments regarding the adequacy of various Defendants’ searches are not\n\nwithin this mandate, they are not properly before the Court. 8\n\n       Accordingly, having found that none of Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the adequacy of\n\nthe Army’s search—in conjunction with NARA—have merit, the Court grants Defendants\n\nsummary judgment on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          In a letter to the Court of Appeals during the latest appeal, Plaintiffs raised a number of\nadditional miscellaneous deficiencies they perceived with the copy of digitized Army records\nthey had received. Ex. A to Defs.’ Response to the Court’s Order of November 20, 2015, ECF\nNo. [296-1] (April 8, 2015 Letter from James H. Lesar to Mark J. Langer). It is unclear whether\nPlaintiffs continue to press those arguments in their cross-motion for summary judgment, but the\nCourt notes that they would similarly not be grounds for denying Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment. Defendants have provided uncontested explanations for these perceived\nproblems. For example, the backside of certain documents appear to not have been microfilmed\ndue to an error of the microfilmer long before the passage of the FOIA, Benear Decl. ¶ 15, and\nwhat appeared to Plaintiffs to be redactions on certain documents were in fact the effect of\nstaples being photocopied, id. ¶ 9. These minor and explainable issues regarding the quality of\ndocuments microfilmed long ago clearly has no effect on the adequacy of Defendants’ search, or\nany other legal issue in this case. Additionally, Plaintiffs at times throughout this and prior\nbriefing have suggested that certain “dossiers” show that there is responsive material that has not\nbeen provided to them, but Plaintiffs present no adequate explanation of, or support for, this\nassertion, which the Court accordingly rejects.\n                                                  16\n\fB. Redactions on Army Records Produced During Appeal\n\n        The records released to Plaintiffs after the oral argument before the Court of Appeals in\n\n2014 include 2,863 pages. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 26; Murphy Decl. ¶ 17. Of those 2,863, redactions now\n\nappear on the face of 10 pages. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 33; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 33. The redactions\n\nhave been made at the request of the CIA, and are made pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3.\n\nSee generally Decl. of Mary E. Wilson, ECF No. [296-4] (“Wilson Decl.”). Most of the redactions\n\nare very minimal. See Wilson Decl., Ex. A. Despite the minimal nature of these redactions,\n\nhowever, Plaintiffs contend that the FOIA exemptions have been misapplied and that summary\n\njudgment for Defendants is still not warranted. The Court considers Defendants’ showing and\n\nPlaintiffs’ arguments with respect to each exemption in turn.\n\n        1. Exemption 1\n\n        Several redactions to the 10 pages still at issue have been justified by Defendants, in part,\n\nas properly withheld under FOIA Exemption 1. Exemption 1 provides that agencies may withhold\n\nrecords that are “(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be\n\nkept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified\n\npursuant to such Executive order.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1). The parties apparently agree that the\n\nrelevant Executive Order for the purposes of Defendants’ current Exemption 1 withholdings is\n\nExecutive Order 13526. Pls.’ Mot. at 19; Defs.’ Mot. at 26. Executive Order 13526 “sets forth\n\nboth substantive and procedural criteria for classification.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nDef., 715 F.3d 937, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have failed to satisfy\n\ntheir burden of showing that the redacted information is properly classified under either the Order’s\n\nsubstantive or its procedural criteria. Pls.’ Mot. at 19.\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\f           a. Whether The Withheld Information Is Properly Classified Substantively\n\n       First, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ various attempts to undermine Defendants’ showing\n\nthat the documents were properly classified under Executive Order 13526’s substantive criteria.\n\nThat criteria requires that classified information pertain to at least one of the Executive Order’s\n\nsubject-matter classification categories and that “disclosure of that information [ ] reasonably be\n\nexpected to cause some degree of harm to national security.” Judicial Watch, 715 F.3d at 941.\n\n       Defendants have provided the declaration of Mary E. Wilson to carry their burden of\n\nshowing that the withheld information was properly classified. Wilson Decl. Ms. Wilson states\n\nthat she is the Acting Information Review Officer for the Litigation Information Review Office\n\nat the CIA. Id. ¶ 1. In that role, Ms. Wilson holds original classification authority. Id. ¶ 3.\n\n       Ms. Wilson states that she has reviewed the documents and “determined that some of the\n\ninformation contained in the documents at issue is currently and properly classified.” Id. ¶ 9.\n\nAttached to Ms. Wilson’s declaration is a copy of each document with labels indicating what\n\nportions of the document are classified. Id., Ex. A. Ms. Wilson states that the information that\n\nremains redacted falls within Executive Order 13526’s classification categories, including\n\n“intelligence activities . . . intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology,” or “foreign relations\n\nor foreign activities of the United States.” Id. ¶ 14. Ms. Wilson also states that the\n\n“unauthorized disclosure of the information “would reasonably be expected to result in serious\n\ndamage to the U.S. national security.” Id. Specifically, Ms. Wilson explains that the withheld\n\ninformation “pertains to specific CIA intelligence methods still in use, including cover\n\nmechanisms; information regarding foreign liaison relationships; and cities and countries in\n\nwhich CIA maintained covert CIA installations,” and that the release of such information would\n\nresult in the harm described in the previous declaration of Martha M. Lutz. Id. ¶ 15. In a\n\n                                                  18\n\fdeclaration filed earlier in this litigation, Ms. Lutz, the then-Chief of the Litigation Support Unit\n\nof the CIA, explained in detail the harm that results from disclosure of such classified CIA\n\ninformation. Decl. of Martha M. Lutz, ECF No. [240-5] (“Lutz Decl.”). Ms. Lutz explained that\n\nrevealing intelligence sources, even years later, makes it more difficult for the United States to\n\ncreate and maintain confidential intelligence relationships. Id. ¶¶ 36-40. Revealing intelligence\n\nmethods or the information produced by those methods reduces their effectiveness and allows\n\nhostile entities to penetrate, detect, prevent, damage or otherwise neutralize United States\n\nintelligence operations. Id. ¶¶ 41-52. The Court is satisfied by this articulation of potential harm\n\nfrom disclosure. See Am. Civil Liberties, 628 F.3d at 626 (approving of similar explanations of\n\nharm from the release of CIA information in support of Exemption 1 claim).\n\n       Accordingly, based on the explanation provided by Ms. Wilson and Ms. Lutz, the general\n\nnature of the records at issue, and the non-redacted context in those records, and bearing in mind\n\nthat “in the context of national security concerns, courts must accord substantial weight to an\n\nagency’s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record,” Wolf v.\n\nC.I.A., 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (internal quotations omitted), the Court finds that\n\nDefendants have satisfied their burden of showing that the minimal amount of withheld\n\ninformation is properly classified under Executive Order 13526’s substantive criteria.\n\n       None of Plaintiffs’ numerous arguments on this point changes the Court’s conclusion.\n\nFirst, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have not provided enough “context” or information\n\nabout the documents for Plaintiffs to be able to assess whether the withheld information warrants\n\nclassification. For example, Plaintiffs fault the Wilson declaration for not indicating whether the\n\nredacted intelligence mechanisms are known to foreign governments, whether installations are\n\nknown to the countries in which they are installed, and whether human intelligence sources are\n\n                                                 19\n\fstill alive. Pls.’ Mot. at 31. Plaintiffs also fault the Wilson declaration for not providing the\n\ntopics discussed at a certain meeting, the minutes of which are mostly redacted from one of the\n\nrecently-provided Army documents. Id. at 28. The Court accepts that some of this information\n\ncould be relevant in a Vaughn index relating to classified CIA information, but the Court is not\n\npersuaded that Ms. Wilson’s failure to include all of this information renders her declaration\n\ninsufficient. “If an agency’s statements supporting exemption contain reasonable specificity of\n\ndetail as to demonstrate that the withheld information logically falls within the claimed\n\nexemption and evidence in the record does not suggest otherwise . . . the court should not\n\nconduct a more detailed inquiry to test the agency’s judgment and expertise or to evaluate\n\nwhether the court agrees with the agency’s opinions.” Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857,\n\n865 (D.C. Cir. 2009). As discussed above, Defendants have provided declarations that\n\nadequately explain why the withheld information is properly classified under Executive Order\n\n13526, and therefore exempt under Exemption 1. None of the information Plaintiffs fault\n\nDefendant for not providing was required to accomplish this, and accordingly the absence of this\n\ninformation does not preclude summary judgment for Defendants.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs argue that by releasing additional information after the most recent\n\nreview of the records at issue conducted by Ms. Wilson, Defendants have implicitly undermined\n\nthe redactions originally made by Ms. Lutz. Pls.’ Mot. at 25. Plaintiffs argue that the “clear\n\nimplication” is that another round of review would result in the disclosure of even more\n\ninformation. Id. This argument is baseless and ignores the reasonable explanation for the further\n\nrelease of information Defendants have already provided. Ms. Wilson explained that these\n\nfurther releases were the result of the fact that at the time the former CIA Information Review\n\nOfficer, Ms. Lutz, had conducted her review of the documents, Executive Order 13526’s 50-year\n\n                                                  20\n\fmandatory declassification provision had not yet come into effect. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 30; Pls.’ Resp.\n\nto Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 30. That provision had come into effect by the time Ms. Wilson conducted her\n\nreview. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 31; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 31. It was for this reason that more\n\ninformation could be released after Ms. Wilson’s review. This in no way indicates that another\n\nreview would result in the disclosure of even more information. Plaintiffs cast no serious doubt\n\non this explanation, which the Court accepts as accurate. See Hodge v. F.B.I., 703 F.3d 575, 582\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (rejecting plaintiff’s argument that the fact that “documents contained fewer\n\nredactions when released to [plaintiff] a second time . . . demonstrates that the FBI is improperly\n\nwithholding material”).\n\n       Third, Plaintiffs argue that the credibility of Ms. Wilson’s classification of the records at\n\nissue as “Secret” is undermined by “the fact that she claims that the information is so super-\n\ndamaging to national security that it qualifies for exemption from automatic declassification.”\n\nPls.’ Mot. at 26. In other words, Plaintiffs contend that information being classified as “Secret”\n\nis inconsistent with that same information being exempted from automatic declassification after\n\n50 years under Executive Order 13526. Id. Again, this argument is misguided. Plaintiffs point\n\nto no basis in Executive Order 13526 for the argument that the CIA may not propose to exempt\n\nfrom automatic declassification information that is only classified as “Secret.” Executive Order\n\n13526 merely states that “[i]n extraordinary cases, agency heads may, within 5 years of the onset\n\nof automatic declassification, propose to exempt additional specific information from\n\ndeclassification at 50 years,” so long as the agency head or other senior agency official notifies\n\nthe Director of the Information Security Oversight Office of such a proposal, and it is approved.\n\nE.O. 13526 §§ 3.3(h)(2), 3.3(j). Here, the Director of the CIA proposed to exempt additional\n\ninformation in a “CIA Declassification Guide” dated September 26, 2012. Wilson Decl. ¶ 16.\n\n                                                 21\n\fThe Guide specifically called for the exemption of information that “could reveal: a relationship\n\nor a former relationship with an intelligence or security service of a foreign government or\n\ninternational organization, a nonhuman intelligence source in active use, or an intelligence\n\nmethod in active use.” Id. ¶ 17. The Guide was approved through an appeals process provided\n\nfor in Executive Order 13526. Ms. Wilson states that the withheld information—which relates to\n\nCIA foreign liaison relationships and cities and countries in which the CIA maintained covert\n\ninstallations—is exempt from automatic disclosure pursuant to these approved categories of\n\nexemption. Id. ¶ 20. Accordingly, Defendants have sufficiently shown that the redacted\n\ninformation continues to be properly classified despite the automatic disclosure requirements of\n\nExecutive Order 13526, and the fact that it is classified as “Secret” is irrelevant to this analysis.\n\n       Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that if the redacted information was indeed exempted from\n\nautomatic declassification under Executive Order 13526, section 3.3(j)(1) of that Order required\n\nthat “an agency head or senior agency official [ ] notify the Director of the Information Security\n\nOversight Office . . . of any specific information that the agency proposes to exempt.” Pls.’ Mot.\n\nat 27. That notification was required to include a detailed description of the proposed-exempt\n\ninformation, an explanation of why it should be exempt, and a specific date or event upon which\n\nthe agency proposes automatic declassification eventually to occur. E.O. 13526 § 3.3(j)(1).\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Ms. Wilson’s declaration does not provide all of this information. Id.\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument misses the point of section 3.3(j)(1). This section requires the agency head\n\nor other senior agency official to provide the listed information to the Director of the Information\n\nSecurity Oversight Office as part of the notification process for proposals of additional categories\n\nof information to exempt from automatic disclosure after 50 years. It does not require that this\n\ninformation be given to Plaintiffs or any other individuals who request the exempted documents.\n\n                                                  22\n\fDefendants were, of course, required to provide Plaintiffs and the Court with a reasonably\n\ndetailed explanation of why the redacted information was properly classified and therefore\n\nwithheld, Am. Civil Liberties, 628 F.3d at 619, but that does not require Ms. Wilson to include in\n\nher declaration all of the information the CIA provided to the Director as part of its proposal to\n\nexempt information under section 3.3(j). Ms. Wilson states, and Plaintiffs do not meaningfully\n\nrebut, that such a proposal was made, and that it was eventually approved. This is sufficient.\n\n       Fifth, Plaintiffs contend that “if the withheld material is of such super-importance that its\n\nwithholding must be prolonged beyond even the current 56 years, then one is surprised that the\n\namount of material withheld is so minimal. This is inconsistent with what one would expect.”\n\nPls.’ Mot. at 29. Little need be said about this argument. The fact that only minimal redactions\n\nhave been made to the records is completely irrelevant to the question of whether the information\n\nredacted is properly classified under Executive Order 13526. “Minimal” amounts of information\n\ncan, of course, be significant and properly classified. As Plaintiffs themselves point out, the\n\nredactions in this case “are ‘minimal’ in terms of size, but not in terms of significance.” Pls.’\n\nMot. at 28 n.13. If anything, the minimal nature of the redactions evinces a careful,\n\ndiscriminating review and suggests that Defendants took seriously their obligation to release\n\nnon-exempt and reasonably segregable portions of documents.\n\n       Having rejected all of Plaintiffs’ arguments on these points, the Court concludes that\n\nDefendants have satisfied their burden of showing that the redacted material is properly\n\nclassified under the substantive criteria of Executive Order 13526.\n\n           b. Whether The Withheld Information Is Properly Classified Procedurally\n\n       Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants failed to show that the redacted information was\n\nclassified according to the procedural requirements of Executive Order 13526. Pls.’ Mot. at 19.\n\n                                                 23\n\fIn addition to satisfying an Executive Order’s substantive criteria, “[t]o be classified properly, a\n\ndocument must be classified in accordance with the procedural criteria of the governing Executive\n\nOrder.” Lesar v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 636 F.2d 472, 483 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe information here was not properly classified under the procedural requirements of Executive\n\nOrder 13526 because the redacted documents “do not show any of the classification markings that\n\nshould have been applied as a result of a review under either E.O. 12958 or E.O. 13526.” Pls.’\n\nMot. at 19.\n\n       Although more substantial than Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding Executive Order 13526’s\n\nsubstantive criteria, this argument also fails.       Defendants appear to concede that certain\n\nclassification markings are missing on these documents, Defs.’ Mot. at 31, but claim that, under\n\nthe circumstances, these procedural errors do not prevent Defendants from claiming protection\n\nunder Exemption 1. The Court agrees. As an initial matter, the first sentence of section 1.6(f) of\n\nExecutive Order 13526 expressly states that “[i]nformation assigned a level of classification under\n\nthis or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the\n\nomission of other required markings.” E.O. 13526 § 1.6(f) (emphasis added). As has been\n\ndescribed earlier in this litigation, the records at issue in this case were classified many years ago\n\npursuant to past Executive Orders. According to the plain language of Executive Order 13526\n\nthen, the omission of markings on these documents that would be required under the present\n\nExecutive Order is not controlling. 9\n\n\n\n       9\n         This conclusion is not affected by the second sentence of section 1.6(f), which reads that\n“[w]henever such information is used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed for\npossible declassification, holders of such information shall coordinate with an appropriate\nclassification authority for the application omitted markings.” E.O. 13526 § 1.6(f). Plaintiffs\nargue that because Ms. Wilson does not state that any such coordination or retroactive\napplication of omitted markings has occurred, the lack of markings renders the classification of\n                                                  24\n\f       Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that certain unspecified markings required under\n\npast Executive Orders are missing, the Court finds that such procedural error would not undermine\n\nDefendants’ classification decision so as to preclude reliance on Exemption 1. Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the Court cannot excuse any absence of markings because “interpreting Exemption 1\n\naccording to the plain meaning of the statute requires that an agency meet its burden under\n\nExemption 1(A) and 1(B) separately.” Pls.’ Mot. at 21. By this Plaintiffs appear to mean that to\n\nexcuse any procedural errors in the classification of records would be to ignore part (B) of\n\nExemption 1, which requires that information withheld have been “in fact properly classified\n\npursuant to such Executive order.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1). The Court disagrees that any procedural\n\nerror nullifies the classification of information for the purposes of claiming protection under\n\nExemption 1. As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, “the consequences of particular violations may\n\nvary . . . [f]or procedural violations, some may be of such importance to reflect adversely on the\n\nagency’s overall classification decision, requiring a remand to the district court for in camera\n\ninspection; while others may be insignificant, undermining not at all the agency’s classification\n\ndecision.” Lesar, 636 F.2d at 485. In Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., the D.C. Circuit\n\ndetermined that the absence of required markings on classified documents did not prevent the court\n\nfrom finding that said documents were properly classified, and accordingly withheld under\n\nExemption 1, where the documents fit within the substantive standards of the Executive Order and\n\n“a person with original classification authority has approved the classification decision.” Judicial\n\n\n\nthe documents ineffective. Defendants argue that, to the contrary, the second sentence of section\n1.6(f) is merely a “procedural requirement for correcting an error in marking classified\ninformation.” Defs.’ Mot. at 32. Defendants have the better argument. The Court does not\ninterpret the second sentence of section 1.6(f) as providing that failure to coordinate and correct\nthe errors undermines the classification of the information, which the first sentence of the Order\nstates is effective despite omitted markings.\n                                                 25\n\fWatch, 715 F.3d at 944. In such a situation, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the alleged procedural\n\nerror “would not ‘reflect adversely on the agency’s overall classification decision.’” Id. (quoting\n\nLesar, 636 F. 2d at 484, 485). 10\n\n       Here, as discussed above, the Court has found that the redacted information fits within the\n\nsubstantive criteria of Executive Order 13526. The original classification process appears to have\n\noccurred decades ago and, to the extent certain markings were not applied correctly at that time,\n\nMs. Wilson—who has original classification authority—has now stated that she has reviewed the\n\ninformation and determined that it is properly classified at the “Secret” level under Executive\n\nOrder 13526 as of today. Wilson Decl. ¶ 9. In this situation, the Court is not persuaded that any\n\nmarkings Plaintiffs claim have been omitted reflect adversely on the agency’s classification\n\ndecision such that the Court should find that the redacted information was improperly withheld.\n\nSee Canning v. United States Dep’t of State, 134 F. Supp. 3d 490, 503 (D.D.C. 2015) (“In light of\n\nthe Hackett declarations, which confirm that the withheld documents are properly classified\n\npursuant to EO 13526, the Court is not persuaded that the absence of unspecified markings would\n\naffect the application of Exemption 1 to those documents.”); Bigwood v. United States Dep’t of\n\nDef., 132 F. Supp. 3d 124, 151 (D.D.C. 2015) (“as long as the agency assures the Court that a\n\nperson with original classification authority has approved the classification decision, the agency’s\n\n\n\n\n       10\n           Plaintiffs do not seriously engage with this case law, opting instead to block quote large\nportions of the dissenting opinion from a 1978 case, Goland v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 607\nF.2d 339 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Defendants contend that, even if the quoted language from the\ndissent in Goland were binding law, Plaintiffs’ reliance on that language is misplaced because\nthat opinion addressed a different type of procedural error than is at issue here. Defs.’ Reply at\n5. It is sufficient for the Court to say that the quoted portion of Goland is from a dissenting\nopinion which predates Lesar and Judicial Watch, which are binding D.C. Circuit case law on\nthis subject. Accordingly, to the extent Lesar and Judicial Watch are inconsistent with the\nGoland dissent, the Court’s analysis has been guided by the former opinions.\n                                                   26\n\ffailure to comply with Section 1.6 of E.O. 13,526 should not ‘reflect adversely on the agency’s\n\noverall classification decision.’”) (quoting Judicial Watch, 715 F.3d at 944). 11\n\n        In sum, Ms. Wilson’s declaration—incorporating in part Ms. Lutz’s prior declaration—\n\nestablishes with a reasonable level of specificity that the information at issue was properly\n\nclassified under Executive Order 13526, and thus was properly withheld under FOIA Exemption\n\n1. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\n        2. Exemption 3\n\n        Even if the redactions had not been properly made pursuant to Exemption 1, summary\n\njudgment for Defendants would nevertheless be appropriate because Defendants have satisfied\n\ntheir burden of showing that all redactions at issue were also proper under FOIA Exemption 3.\n\nExemption 3 permits an agency to withhold information “specifically exempted from disclosure\n\nby statute (other than section 552b of this title),” if the relevant statute\n\n        (A)     (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as\n        to leave no discretion on the issue; or\n\n                (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types\n                of matters to be withheld; and\n\n        (B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009,\n        specifically cites to this paragraph.\n\nId. § 552(b)(3). “When analyzing whether the defendant is entitled to invoke Exemption 3, the\n\ncourt need not examine ‘the detailed factual contents of specific documents’ withheld; rather, ‘the\n\n\n\n        11\n         To the extent Plaintiffs also argue that the information was not properly classified\nprocedurally because the CIA did not follow the procedures to exempt the information from\nautomatic disclosure after 50 years, this argument mirrors Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding\nExecutive Order 13526’s substantive criteria and has already been addressed above. Ms. Wilson\nhas explained in reasonable detail that the CIA did in fact seek and receive permission to exempt\nadditional categories of information from automatic disclosure after 50 years, and the redacted\ninformation falls within those additional categories.\n                                                 27\n\fsole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of withheld material\n\nwithin the statute's coverage.’” James Madison Project v. C.I.A., 605 F. Supp. 2d 99, 113-14\n\n(D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Morley v. C.I.A., 508 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). Here, the CIA\n\nargues that it properly withheld certain information as provided by the National Security Act of\n\n1947, as amended, 50 U.S.C. § 3024(i)(1), and the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, 50\n\nU.S.C. § 3507 (“CIA Act”). The National Security Act provides that “[t]he Director of National\n\nIntelligence shall protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.” 50\n\nU.S.C. § 3024(i)(1). The relevant provision of the CIA Act provides that the CIA shall be exempt\n\nfrom disclosing “the organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries, or numbers of\n\npersonnel employed by the Agency.” 50 U.S.C. § 3507. Both the National Security Act and the\n\nCIA Act qualify as Exemption 3 statutes. See Subh v. C.I.A., 760 F. Supp. 2d 66, 70 (D.D.C. 2011)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n       Ms. Wilson states that she has reviewed the withheld information and determined that it is\n\nexempt from disclosure under these statutes. Wilson Decl. ¶ 21. Ms. Wilson explains that the\n\ninformation that has been redacted from the documents at issue include “the names of CIA\n\nemployees; information regarding CIA intelligence methods; information regarding covert CIA\n\ninstallations, including names and locations of these covert installations; signatures of CIA\n\nemployees; and internal CIA organizational information.” Id. ¶ 27. The Court has reviewed the\n\nredacted documents and, based on the context provided by the non-redacted portions and the\n\ngeneral nature of the documents, is persuaded that Ms. Wilson’s assertions are true and accurate.\n\nThe Court notes in particular that it is apparent that the majority of redactions cover only names\n\nor signatures. Based on its own review and Ms. Wilson’s declaration, and especially considering\n\n“the special deference owed to agency affidavits on national security matters,” Morley, 508 F.3d\n\n                                                 28\n\fat 1126, the Court concludes that Defendants have carried their burden of showing that Exemption\n\n3 exempts the redacted information from disclosure because it falls within the purview of either\n\nthe National Security Act or the CIA Act.\n\n       Plaintiffs make a number of arguments in an attempt to discredit Defendants’ Exemption\n\n3 claims, but none have merit. First, with respect to the National Security Act, Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the Court should have “considerable skepticism” about these claims of exemption because it\n\nis “well-established that both the KGB and MI-6 had thoroughly infiltrated the Gehlen\n\nOrganization.” Pls.’ Mot. at 35. Plaintiffs apparently suggest that the CIA is merely attempting\n\nto keep the redacted information secret to protect itself from the embarrassment that would ensue\n\nif this infiltration became public. Id. As support, Plaintiffs point to portions of the IWG Final\n\nReport which criticized the CIA for not being forthcoming with Congress with regard to CIA\n\nactivity after World War II. Id.\n\n       This vague assertion of “skepticism,” Pls.’ Mot. at 36, regarding Defendants’ Exemption\n\n3 claims is far from sufficient grounds upon which to deny Defendants summary judgment. The\n\nmere fact that the Final Report claims that the CIA had acted uncooperatively in the past is clearly\n\ninsufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to the CIA’s statements regarding withholdings in\n\nthis case. Moreover, Plaintiffs present an incomplete and misleading depiction of the Final Report.\n\nThe only portions of the Final Report cited by Plaintiffs that discuss CIA conduct with any\n\nsignificant degree of disapproval concern the CIA’s cooperation with Congress in the 1980s and\n\n1990s. Final Report at 18. The Final Report, which was published in 2007, goes on to conclude\n\nthat “[u]ltimately, the IWG convinced the CIA to be forthcoming to an unprecedented extent in\n\nreleasing information.” Id. at 45. Accordingly, even if the Court were to read as much into the\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fFinal Report as Plaintiffs request, that report shows, if anything, that the CIA has been forthcoming\n\nand cooperative in the present era.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have misapplied the CIA Act because that Act\n\napplies only to “personnel information.” Pls.’ Mot. at 32-33. Plaintiffs claim that “[t]he Wilson\n\nDeclaration does not state that the documents she addresses are personnel documents, and a review\n\nof the records indicates that they are not personnel records but the kind of records normally\n\ngenerated in gathering and disseminating intelligence.” Id. at 33. This argument misses the mark.\n\nIt is true that the CIA Act does not allow the CIA “to refuse to provide any information at all about\n\nanything it does.” Phillippi v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 546 F.2d 1009, 1015 (D.C. Cir. 1976).\n\nInstead, “[o]nly the specific information on the CIA’s personnel and internal structure that is listed\n\nin the statute will obtain protection from disclosure.” Baker v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 580 F.2d\n\n664, 670 (D.C. Cir. 1978); see also Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. C.I.A., 960 F. Supp. 2d 101, 175\n\n(D.D.C. 2013) (the Act “only protects ‘information on the CIA’s personnel and internal structure,’\n\nsuch as the names of personnel, the titles and salaries of personnel, or how personnel are organized\n\nwithin the CIA.”) (quoting Baker, 580 F.2d at 670). These limitations do not, however, provide\n\nany support for Plaintiffs’ argument that the CIA Act redactions in this case are improper because\n\nthe redacted records are not “personnel records.” Pls.’ Mot. at 33 (emphasis added). Clearly,\n\npersonnel “information,” such as the “the names of personnel, the titles and salaries of personnel,\n\nor how personnel are organized within the CIA,” Nat’l Sec. Counselors, 960 F. Supp. 2d at 175,\n\ncan exist on documents that are not “personnel records.” Accordingly, the fact that the redactions\n\nare made on the “the kind of records normally generated in gathering and disseminating\n\nintelligence information” does not show that the redacted information is not protected from\n\ndisclosure under the CIA Act.\n\n                                                 30\n\f       Third, Plaintiffs contend that “a deceased employee is not an employee under the statute”\n\nand that “[e]ven assuming that some of the withheld information is personnel material, no showing\n\nhas been made by Lutz that these persons are still employed by the CIA.” Pls.’ Mot. at 34.\n\nPlaintiffs point to no support for the proposition that a deceased employee is not covered by the\n\nCIA Act, and it finds no support in the plain language of the statute or case law. The statute states\n\nthat the CIA shall be exempt from disclosing “the organization, functions, names, official titles,\n\nsalaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency.” 12 50 U.S.C. § 3507. This language\n\nis not limited to information related to individuals currently employed by the CIA. To the contrary,\n\nthe Court finds that “deceased former employees still fall within the plain language of [§ 3507] as\n\nhaving been ‘employed’ by the CIA.” Hall v. C.I.A., 881 F. Supp. 2d 38, 66 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\n       Finally, in this section of Plaintiffs’ cross-motion Plaintiffs makes various references to the\n\n2013 Lutz Declaration and corresponding Vaughn index, and challenge certain redactions\n\nexplained therein. For example, Plaintiffs state that “[w]hat is true of the withholdings addressed\n\nby Wilson is also true of the material withheld under this Exemption 3 claim in the Vaughn indices\n\nattached to the Lutz declarations.” Pls.’ Mot. at 33. Plaintiffs also fault Defendants for not\n\nresponding to Plaintiffs’ “citation of the first entry in the Lutz Vaughn index as a misuse of the\n\nNSA Act ‘sources and methods’ claim.” Id. at 36. These arguments are irrelevant because they\n\nare outside the scope of the Court of Appeals’ remand in this case. As discussed above, the Court\n\nof Appeals’ mandate to this Court stated that “[t]he remand is limited to the issues arising from\n\nthe Army’s release to DiBacco during the appeal of responsive but redacted Army documents that\n\n\n       12\n          Plaintiffs argue in their Reply that the plain language of the statute supports their\ninterpretation because “the plain meaning of ‘employee’ is a person who is working for\nsomeone.” Pls.’ Reply at 9. But the relevant statutory language refers not to “employees” but to\n“personnel employed by the Agency.” 50 U.S.C. § 3507 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                 31\n\fhad been held by the National Archives.” Mandate, ECF No. 275.             Because the redactions\n\ndiscussed in the Lutz declaration are not within this mandate, they are not before the Court.\n\n       In sum, the Court finds that Defendants have carried their burden of showing that the\n\nredacted material is exempt from disclosure under Exemption 3 pursuant to the National Security\n\nAct and the CIA Act. Defendants are accordingly entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\n       3. Segregability\n\n       Finally, the Court finds that Defendants have satisfied their burden of demonstrating that\n\nno nonexempt and reasonably segregable information has been withheld. “[E]ven if the agency\n\nestablishes an exemption, it must nonetheless disclose all reasonably segregable, nonexempt\n\nportions of the requested record(s).” Roth v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 642 F.3d 1161, 1167 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011) (citation omitted). “Agencies are entitled to a presumption that they complied with the\n\nobligation to disclose reasonably segregable material.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d\n\n1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n       Defendants have submitted a declaration from Antoinette B. Shiner, the Information\n\nReview Officer for the Litigation Information Review Office at the CIA—an individual who holds\n\noriginal classification authority—in which Ms. Shiner states that she has “conducted a document-\n\nby-document and line-by-line review of the records at issue in this case and ha[s] determined that\n\nall reasonably segregable nonexempt information has been released to plaintiffs.” Decl. of\n\nAntoinette B. Shiner, ECF No. [344-1] (“Shiner Decl.”), at ¶ 5. The Court notes that Plaintiffs\n\nargued in their opposition to Defendants’ Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment that Ms.\n\nWilson’s declaration did “not state, much less show, that there are no segregable portions\n\nremaining.”   Pls.’ Mot. at 31.     Accordingly, the Court ordered Defendants to provide a\n\nsupplemental declaration specifically addressing segregability, which Defendants did by filing the\n\n                                                32\n\fShiner Declaration on January 11, 2017. The Court gave Plaintiffs the opportunity to respond to\n\nthe Shiner Declaration, which they did on January 13, 2017. Pls.’ Resp. to Court’s Order of\n\nJanuary 11, 2017, ECF No. [345]. Plaintiffs raised a number of arguments regarding the adequacy\n\nof Ms. Shiner’s declaration, none of which were persuasive. Plaintiffs argued that Defendants had\n\nnot proffered a “plausible explanation” as to why this declaration was submitted by Ms. Shiner, as\n\nopposed to Ms. Wilson submitting a supplemental declaration. Id. at 1-2. But Defendants have\n\noffered such an explanation: Ms. Shiner replaced Ms. Wilson as Information Review Officer\n\nshortly after Ms. Wilson executed the declaration discussed elsewhere in this Memorandum\n\nOpinion. The Court also rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that Ms. Shiner’s declaration does not comply\n\nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, given that Ms. Shiner declares that her statements are\n\nbased on her own line-by-line review of the documents at issue. Shiner Decl. ¶ 5. The remainder\n\nof Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the adequacy of the Shiner Declaration simply rehash points\n\nmade in Plaintiffs’ other pleadings, which have been addressed as necessary in this Opinion.\n\nMostly, Plaintiffs fault Ms. Shiner for not addressing all of the various substantive issues related\n\nto Defendants’ claims under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, but this argument ignores the fact that the\n\nShiner Declaration was submitted in response to a Court order that only requested from Defendants\n\na narrow declaration on their position as to the segregability of any nonexempt information\n\nredacted from the records at issue. 1/5/2017 Minute Order.\n\n       The Court concludes that the Shiner Declaration, in concert with Ms. Wilson’s declaration\n\nwhich was submitted by Defendants to act as a Vaughn index, and the Court’s review of the narrow\n\nredactions at issue, is sufficient to persuade the Court that no nonexempt and reasonably segregable\n\ninformation has been withheld. See Johnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Attorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 776\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (“The combination of the Vaughn index and the affidavits of Gay and Davis are\n\n                                                33\n\fsufficient to fulfill the agency’s obligation to show with ‘reasonable specificity’ why a document\n\ncannot be further segregated.”); Mobley v. C.I.A., 924 F. Supp. 2d 24, 73 (D.D.C. 2013), aff’d, 806\n\nF.3d 568 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“an agency may satisfy its segregability obligations by (1) providing a\n\nVaughn index that adequately describes each withheld document and the exemption under which\n\nit was withheld; and (2) submitting a declaration attesting that the agency released all segregable\n\nmaterial.”).\n\n       Plaintiffs offer no evidence or persuasive argument to rebut the presumption that no\n\nreasonably segregable information has been withheld. Plaintiffs’ only arguments that the Court\n\ninterprets as relating to segregability focus on a document containing minutes from a June 15, 1960\n\nmeeting of BND officials, found at page 30 of Exhibit A to the Wilson Declaration. Although\n\nconsiderably more information has been withheld from this document than has been withheld from\n\nthe other documents at issue, the extent of the redactions itself is not sufficient to overcome the\n\npresumption of compliance with the agency’s obligation to produce reasonably segregable\n\ninformation. Indeed, the Court finds that, in this case, “given the sensitive nature” of the\n\ndocuments at issue, “it is unsurprising that [the] document[ ] would be heavily redacted.” Hodge,\n\n703 F.3d at 582. Beyond the mere fact that a fairly substantial portion of the document has been\n\nredacted, Plaintiffs’ attempts to show that the document contains some redacted nonexempt\n\ninformation are unpersuasive. For example, the document apparently contains the “significant\n\npoints discussed” at the meeting, and the author of the document recommends not raising point\n\n‘b’—which is redacted—with “top officials.” Wilson Decl., Ex. A at 30. From this, Plaintiffs\n\nderive that the author believed that the redacted point ‘b’ was “more sensitive” than a redacted\n\npoint ‘a,’ and therefore, Plaintiffs argue, it is suspicious that both points would be classified at the\n\nsame level. Pls.’ Mot. at 30. It is not. Even accepting Plaintiffs’ unfounded assumption that the\n\n                                                  34\n\fauthor’s recommendation of not bringing one of the redacted points to the attention of “top\n\nofficials” was driven by his or her belief that that point was “more sensitive” than the other,\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument fails because of course both points could still be properly classified or\n\nwithheld under the standards of Exemptions 1 or 3 regardless of their varying degrees of\n\n“sensitivity.” In short, none of Plaintiffs’ arguments alter the Court’s conclusion that Defendants\n\nhave satisfied their burden of showing that no reasonably segregable nonexempt information has\n\nbeen withheld, from this or any other document at issue.\n\nC. Miscellaneous Points\n\n       Finally, the Court briefly addresses some miscellaneous points raised by the parties in\n\ntheir briefing. First, Plaintiffs have included in their cross-motion for summary judgment and\n\nreply brief lengthy descriptions of their theory that a German double agent, Werner von\n\nAlvensleben, was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Pls.’ Mot. a 4-10;\n\nPls.’ Reply at 1-4. Plaintiffs claim that von Alvensleben learned the trade of political\n\nassassination from his father, a member of the Prussian noble Junker family, and later conspired\n\nto kill President Kennedy with the owner of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Id.\n\nThis lengthy discussion is irrelevant to the factual and legal issues raised by the pending motions\n\nand accordingly is not helpful to the Court. The Court rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that these\n\nassertions—most of which are not supported by any factual citation—make summary judgment\n\n“inappropriate.” Pls.’ Mot. at 10. Plaintiffs complain that they have not received records related\n\nto von Alvensleben, but Plaintiffs do not explain why such records would be responsive to\n\nOglesby’s FOIA requests, which requested information from a different time frame and related\n\nto different individuals. Moreover, even if they were responsive, “the fact that a particular\n\ndocument was not found does not demonstrate the inadequacy of a search,” Boyd v. Criminal\n\n                                                35\n\fDiv. of U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 475 F.3d 381, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and accordingly the Court\n\nwould not find that any Defendants’ searches were inadequate simply because Plaintiffs are\n\ndisappointed that they did not receive documents pertaining to this individual. Finally, as with\n\nother miscellaneous issues raised by Plaintiffs, this issue is clearly not within the Court of\n\nAppeals’ narrow remand. The Court will also not “order the government to investigate the\n\ninformation on this topic provided by plaintiffs and report back to the Court and the parties.”\n\nPls.’ Mot. at 45. Ordering the investigation of a particular theory regarding President Kennedy’s\n\nassassination is, of course, not the Court’s proper role under the FOIA. See Mobley, 924 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 51-52 (“[I]t is not the Court’s proper place to decide who should or should not be the\n\nsubject of intelligence gathering activities.”).\n\n        The Court also acknowledges that the parties dispute whether the continuation of this\n\ncase benefits the public and serves the purposes of the FOIA. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\n\nhave not recently made efforts to share the documents they have received with the public, and\n\ncomplain that this case has veered off track, with Plaintiffs now raising arguments about various\n\nsubstantive issues irrelevant in a FOIA case. Defs.’ Mot. at 38-41; Defs.’ Opp’n at 2-5, 7-8.\n\nPlaintiffs respond that prior-Plaintiff Oglesby had been reviewing the documents released in this\n\ncase as late as 2008, and “had been in contact with the undersigned counsel about his work on\n\nthe Gehlen Org” in 2011. Pls.’ Mot. at 43. Plaintiffs also claim that “undersigned counsel has\n\npersonally distributed copies of the released materials to researchers deeply interested in the\n\nsubject.” Id. The Court acknowledges that this case has persisted for a lengthy period and that,\n\nas discussed above, certain portions of Plaintiffs’ briefing are irrelevant to the legal issues\n\nactually remaining before the Court. Accordingly, the Court has only herein addressed those\n\npoints that are necessary to resolve the remaining arguments regarding the minimal redactions\n\n                                                   36\n\fstill at issue in this case and bring this dispute to a close. The Court has not, however, rested its\n\ndecision to grant summary judgment for Defendants on the duration or perceived lack of public\n\nbenefit of this case.\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary\n\njudgment on all remaining issues. The documents that were released to Plaintiffs during the\n\nlatest appeal do not demonstrate that Defendants’ search for responsive documents was\n\ninadequate, and the minimal redactions made to those documents are justified under FOIA\n\nExemptions 1 and 3. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ [327] Renewed Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment and DENIES Plaintiffs’ [330] Renewed Motion for Partial Summary\n\nJudgment and Other Relief. An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nDated: January 18, 2017\n                                                          /s/\n                                                       COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                                       United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                  37\n\f",

It is now 2017. Over\n\nthe past twenty years, this case has gone through numerous rounds of summary judgment briefing\n\nand reached the United States Court of Appeals three times. Mr. Ogelsby himself died in 2011,\n\nbut his daughter and the administrator of his estate have since been substituted as Plaintiffs and\n\ncontinue his efforts. After a very limited remand from the Court of Appeals in 2015, the latest\n\nround of cross-motions for summary judgment are currently before the Court.\n\n       Upon consideration of the pleadings, 1 the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a\n\nwhole, the Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all remaining\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The Court’s analysis has focused on the following documents: Defs.’ Renewed Mot. for\nSumm.

In an exercise\nof its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action would not be of assistance\nin rendering a decision. See LCvR 7(f).\n\fissues. The Court finds that Defendants have satisfied their burden of showing that the minimal\n\nredactions made to the documents that were released to Plaintiffs during the latest appeal are\n\njustified under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3. The Court also rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that the\n\ndocuments produced during the appeal indicate that any Defendant has not completed an adequate\n\nsearch for responsive documents. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ [327] Renewed\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment and DENIES Plaintiffs’ [330] Renewed Motion for Partial\n\nSummary Judgment and Other Relief.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Since the early 1970s, [Carl] Oglesby has relentlessly pursued the story of General\n       Reinhard Gehlen, who served as chief of a Nazi spy ring during World War II and\n       who allegedly later negotiated an agreement with the United States which allowed\n       his spy network to continue in existence despite post-war de-nazification programs.\n       After World War II, his group, then known as the Gehlen Organization, was\n       reportedly reconstituted as a functioning espionage network under U.S. command.\n       According to Oglesby, control of the Gehlen Organization shifted back to the\n       newly-sovereign West German Federal Republic as the BND (for\n       Bundesnachrichtendienst, or “the Federal Intelligence Service”) after ten years of\n       U.S. control.\n\nOglesby v.

Cir. 1996). 2 To that end,\n\nbetween August 21 and September 19, 1985, Carl Oglesby submitted nearly identical Freedom of\n\nInformation Act requests to the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States Departments of the\n\nArmy and State, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”). See Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army\n\n(“Oglesby I”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552329\"><a href=\"/opinion/552329/carl-oglesby-v-the-united-states-department-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (D.C. Cir. 1990). “[W]ith minor variations,” Oglesby sought the\n\nfollowing records from each agency:\n\n\n       2\n         Given the lengthy proceedings in this case to date, the background of this case has been\ndescribed in a number of prior opinions. The Court sees no reason to reinvent the wheel here.\nAccordingly, the first portion of the background section in this Memorandum Opinion is largely\nderived from the Court’s September 26, 2013 Memorandum Opinion.\n                                                2\n\f       (1) records on General Gehlen during the period 1944 through 1956;\n\n       (2) records on meetings held at Fort Hunt, Virginia, in the summer of 1945 between\n       General Gehlen and U.S. Army General George Strong and Office of Strategic\n       Services (“OSS”) officer Allen Dulles;\n\n       (3) records on the U.S. Army’s “Operation Rusty,” carried out in Europe between\n       1945 and 1948;\n\n       (4) records on post-war Nazi German underground organizations such as “Odessa,”\n       “Kamaradenwerk,” “Bruderschaft,” “Werewolves” and “Die Spinne”;\n\n       (5) records on the OSS’s “Operation Sunrise” carried out in 1945; and\n\n       (6) records on Gehlen’s relationship with William J. Donovan and Allen Dulles of\n       the OSS, records on Operation Rusty and Gehlen collected by the Central\n       Intelligence Group (“CIG”), and records on the Nazi underground organization “La\n       Arana.”\n\nId. The agencies released a total of 384 pages, many with redactions, and withheld other\n\nresponsive documents. Id. The Army, CIA, NARA, and NSA denied Mr. Oglesby’s request for\n\na fee waiver. Id. at 61.\n\n       Mr. Oglesby filed suit on December 11, 1987. The District Court, per Judge Norma\n\nHolloway Johnson, granted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants. 5/22/1989 Mem. Op.\n\n& Order. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit found that Oglesby had failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies with respect to his requests to the Army, CIA, FBI, NSA, and NARA, but had\n\nconstructively exhausted his administrative remedies concerning his request to the Department of\n\nState. Oglesby I, 920 F.2d at 59-60. The court remanded the case, instructing Oglesby to exhaust\n\nhis remedies, and leaving for the District Court the issue of whether the Department of State\n\nconducted an adequate search in response to Oglesby’s request. Id.\n\n       Following the Oglesby I decision, Oglesby exhausted his administrative remedies, and once\n\nagain challenged the Defendants’ responses. Oglesby II, 79 F.3d at 1176. The District Court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the Defendants, concluding that each Defendant agency\n\n                                               3\n\fconducted an adequate search for documents and properly withheld information pursuant to\n\nvarious FOIA exemptions. Id. Mr. Oglesby appealed, challenging (1) NARA’s refusal to grant\n\nOglesby a fee waiver; (2) the adequacy of the searches conducted by the Army, CIA, FBI, NSA,\n\nand State Department; (3) the adequacy of the Vaughn indices submitted by the Army, CIA, and\n\nNSA; and (4) the CIA’s and Army’s withholding of certain responsive documents. Id. at 1175.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit agreed that the CIA and the Army failed to show that they conducted adequate\n\nsearches, and that the CIA, Army, and NSA failed to adequately justify their withholdings. Id.\n\nThe court affirmed the District Court in all other respects. Id. Upon remand, the Army, CIA, and\n\nNSA eventually filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. 9/25/97 Mot. for Summ. J., ECF\n\nNo. [129]. Just short of one year later, Oglesby filed an opposition to the Defendants’ motion and\n\ncross-moved for summary judgment. 9/14/98 Cross Mot., ECF No. [176].3\n\n       On October 8, 1998, President William Clinton signed into law the “Nazi War Crimes\n\nDisclosure Act,” or “NWCDA.” P.L. 105-246, 5 U.S.C. § 552 note. The act “required the U.S.\n\nGovernment to locate, declassify, and release in their entirety, with few exceptions, remaining\n\nclassified records about war crimes committed by Nazi Germany and its allies.” Nazi War Crimes\n\n& Japanese Imperial Gov’t Records Interagency Working Group, Final Report to the United States\n\nCongress 1 (Apr. 2007), ECF No. [244-1] (“Final Report”). To oversee the implementation of\n\nNWCDA and the Japanese-Imperial Government Disclosure Act of 2000, the President created an\n\nInteragency Working Group (“IWG” or “the working group”), consisting of the Archivist of the\n\nUnited States, designated representatives of the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Council, the\n\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Departments of Defense, Justice, and State, as well as\n\n\n       3\n          Pleadings and orders submitted prior to 2006 are not on the electronic docket, but can be\nlocated in the case file maintained by the Clerk of Court.\n\n                                                4\n\fthree public members. Id. Although General Gehlen is not considered a Nazi war criminal, “the\n\nCIA pledged to acknowledge the intelligence relationship with General Gehlen in records\n\nprocessed for release under the [NWCDA].” Id. at 48. Accordingly, “the CIA approved the release\n\nof the 2,100-page Army Gehlen file, and in addition released nearly 2,100 pages of materials\n\nrelating to Gehlen from its own files as well as files on many of Gehlen’s personnel and agents—\n\nincluding the operational information in all of these files.” Id.\n\n        While the parties’ cross-motions were pending, the Defendants submitted a declaration\n\nfrom William H. McNair, the Information Review Officer for the Directorate of Operations for the\n\nCIA, indicating that the Director of Central Intelligence declassified the relationship between the\n\nUnited States Government and the Gehlen Organization. Decl. of William H. McNair, ECF No.\n\n[242-1], at ¶ 9. In light of the declassification, the CIA indicated it needed to reprocess its previous\n\nreleases to Oglesby and its referrals to the CIA from other agencies “because additional\n\ninformation may now be appropriate for release.” 10/31/00 Status Report, ECF No. [211], at 3.\n\nUnsure of what effect the declassification might have on the Defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment with respect to the NSA and the Army, the Defendants withdrew the pending motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Id. at 6. Oglesby noted that his cross-motion may also be moot due to the\n\nclassification.   11/17/00 Order, ECF No. [214], at 2.          The Court accordingly ordered the\n\nDefendants to file a status report by no later than December 11, 2000, indicating “how much time\n\nis needed to complete its review of responsive material” and “how much time is needed to prepare\n\nand file a Vaughn declaration and accompanying motion for summary judgment.” Id.\n\n        Pursuant to the Court’s November 2000 Order, the Defendants submitted a status report\n\nindicating that “recent CIA searches conducted in response to the portion of the plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequest regarding General Gehlen have resulted in locating approximately 251 boxes of material,\n\n                                                   5\n\fand 2,901 folders, with documents that likely contain records regarding General Gehlen.” 4\n\n12/11/00 Status Report, ECF No. [215], at 1-2. The Defendants explained that “CIA reviewers\n\nprocessing documents for release under the NWCDA [would] be most familiar with the material\n\nat issue in plaintiff’s FOIA request,” therefore the CIA proposed “incorporat[ing] the processing\n\nof plaintiff’s FOIA request into the processing of the documents to be reviewed pursuant to the\n\nNWCDA.” Id. at 2. The Defendants suggested this approach would benefit Mr. Oglesby because\n\n“the CIA [would] release responsive documents to the plaintiff as they [were] released under the\n\nNWCDA, instead of waiting until all documents are processed,” as was the CIA’s general\n\nprocedure in FOIA cases. Id. The Defendants estimated that the processing of all responsive\n\ndocuments under the NWCDA would be completed “within a year,” but that “additional\n\ndocuments that go beyond the scope of the Act—which the CIA anticipates locating—will also\n\nneed to be processed.” Id. Accordingly, the CIA requested two years in which to complete its\n\nreview of documents and to file a Vaughn index. Id. at 3. The parties discussed many of the issues\n\nraised in the Defendants’ status report during a status hearing on January 9, 2001. Noting that\n\nmany of the documents were likely to be in German and thus need translating before processing,\n\nthe Court asked the Defendants to submit a further status report in approximately three weeks.\n\n1/9/01 Tr. 18:21-19:2. The Court anticipated that the Defendants would file additional status\n\nreports as the documents were being processed, but advised Plaintiffs’ counsel that if he was\n\ndissatisfied with the pace at which documents were reviewed or produced, he should contact the\n\nCourt and request another status hearing. Id. 20:15-21.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         During the status hearing on January 9, 2001, the Defendants estimated that the 251\nboxes might contain between 251,000 and 775,000 pages of material. 1/9/01 Tr. 4:15-23.\n                                             6\n\f       In a further status report submitted on February 5, 2001, the Defendants explained that the\n\nCIA had identified “numerous code words associated with Gehlen and the Gehlen Organization,\n\nand conducted a search of the applicable records systems using these code words,” identifying “a\n\npotential universe of over 25,000 responsive documents.” 2/5/01 Status Report, ECF No. [216] at\n\n2. The CIA intended to conduct another search “within the next two months” using additional\n\nsearch terms. Id. at 3-4. The agency estimated that the review of all potentially responsive\n\ndocuments, including referrals to other agencies as necessary, would take two years to complete,\n\n“but because of the many variables, the CIA suggest[ed] that it provide interim status reports on\n\nthe CIA’s Progress every four to six months.” Id. at 4. The Court did not issue any orders in\n\nresponse to the February 2001 status report. In fact, between February 2001 and December 2011,\n\nneither party submitted any documentation to the Court, save notice of change of addresses for\n\ncounsel and notices of substitution of counsel for the Defendants.\n\n       Nearly eleven years after the Defendants’ last status report, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to\n\nsubstitute Ms. DiBacco and Ms. Webster as Plaintiffs, which Judge James E. Boasberg granted in\n\nhis capacity as the motions Judge. 12/1/11 Mot., ECF No. [224]; 1/5/12 Minute Order. The\n\nPlaintiffs then moved to compel the Defendants to, among other things, describe the searches\n\nconducted for potentially responsive documents, provide copies of all draft status reports created\n\nafter February 2001, provide copies of all Vaughn indices submitted to the Plaintiffs since February\n\n2001, “[l]ist and provide copies of all correspondence which was sent to Carl Oglesby or his\n\nattorney regarding this case subsequent to the February 5, 2001 status report,” and “[l]ist and\n\nprovide copies of all records released pursuant to this lawsuit subsequent to the February 5, 2001\n\nstatus report.” Pls.’ Mot. to Compel, ECF No. [227]. Once the Plaintiffs’ motion was fully briefed,\n\nthe case was randomly reassigned to the undersigned. 5/30/12 Reassignment of Civil Case, ECF\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. [237]. The Court promptly denied the Plaintiffs’ motion to compel, and ordered the parties to\n\nsubmit a proposed briefing schedule for dispositive motions. 5/30/12 Minute Order.\n\n       The parties then filed and briefed new cross motions for summary judgment.             On\n\nSeptember 26, 2013, the Court granted Defendants’ [240] Renewed Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and denied Plaintiffs’ [241] Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. 9/26/2013 Order,\n\nECF No. [256]. The Court held that Defendants had met their burden of showing, through detailed\n\ndeclarations and Vaughn indices, that the CIA and the Army conducted adequate searches for\n\nresponsive records, and that the NSA, the CIA, and the Army properly withheld certain\n\ninformation pursuant to various FOIA exemptions. 9/26/2013 Mem. Op., ECF No. [257], at 2.\n\n       Plaintiffs appealed this Court’s decision, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

It also rejected Plaintiffs’\n\nargument that summary judgment was not proper because the Army had transferred responsive\n\ndocuments to NARA, finding that the Army had transferred those documents in order “to fulfill\n\nthe Army’s obligations under the Disclosure Act,” not to evade its FOIA obligations. Id. at 192.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also found that the CIA had conducted an adequate search for records under\n\nFOIA, id. at 195, and had satisfied its burden of showing that it had properly withheld certain\n\ninformation pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, id. at 195-99.\n\n       However, the Court of Appeals remanded the case back to this Court “to address in the first\n\ninstance DiBacco’s and Webster’s challenges to redactions in a batch of records that the Army\n\ndisclosed to them while this appeal was pending.” Id. at 183. At oral argument, Plaintiffs argued\n\nthat the Army’s transfer of its records to NARA deprived Plaintiffs of the benefit of the Army’s\n\nfee waiver for their FOIA requests.

The Court of Appeals\n\n“accordingly remand[ed] to allow the parties to create a record and the district court to decide in\n\nthe first instance the narrow question of whether those withholdings were permissible under\n\nFOIA.” Id.

DISCUSSION\n\n       The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment cover two main areas of dispute: (A)\n\nwhether the Army has conducted an adequate search for records and (B) whether the redactions\n\nDefendants made to the Army records released to Plaintiffs during the course of the latest appeal\n\nwere proper under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\n\nboth issues. The Court will address each in turn, and then (C) conclude by addressing certain\n\nmiscellaneous points raised in the parties’ briefs.\n\nA. Adequacy of the Army’s Search for Records\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the records released during the latest appeal show that the Army—in\n\nconjunction with NARA—has not conducted an adequate search for records responsive to\n\nOglesby’s FOIA requests. 5 “In order to obtain summary judgment the agency must show that it\n\nmade a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can\n\nbe reasonably expected to produce the information requested.” Oglesby I, 920 F.2d at 68. “[T]he\n\nissue to be resolved is not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to\n\nthe request, but rather whether the search for those documents was adequate.” Weisberg v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442963\"><a href=\"/opinion/442963/harold-weisberg-v-us-department-of-justice-two-cases-harold-weisberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1485 (D.C.

Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (D.D.C. 2014).\n\n       Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this issue. This Court has already\n\nanalyzed the more-than-reasonable search for records undertaken by the Army, in conjunction with\n\n\n       5\n        NARA is no longer a defendant in this case, but the Army has transferred its records\nthat would be responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests to NARA, who has accepted full\nresponsibility for them and “conducted the most recent searches of those files for records\nresponsive to Oglesby’s FOIA request.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 189-90.\n\n                                                 12\n\fNARA, and determined that it was adequate for the purposes of FOIA. DiBacco, 983 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 62-64. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals. DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 188-92. The\n\nCourt will not repeat that analysis here, although it incorporates it by reference into this\n\nMemorandum Opinion. It is sufficient for the purposes of the pending cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment to state that nothing in the records produced to Plaintiffs during the course of the latest\n\nappeal of this case undermines the Court’s previous conclusions with respect to the adequacy of\n\nthose searches. 6\n\n        First, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ contention that the presence of “Top Secret\n\nReplacement Sheets” in the recently-provided Army records shows that Defendants have not\n\nconducted an adequate search. These “Replacement Sheets” indicate that certain “Top Secret”\n\ndocuments were removed from the records Defendants were able to locate in the immediate\n\naftermath of World War II, roughly 70 years ago. Decl. of Joanne Benear, ECF No. [327-1]\n\n(“Benear Decl.”), at ¶¶ 11-12. These records were microfilmed at the Army’s Counter\n\nIntelligence Corps in Europe at that time. Id. Defendants now avow that, regardless of what\n\nPlaintiffs refer to as the “plethora of information” on these sheets, Pls.’ Mot. at 37, Defendants\n\ndo not know where these documents might have been taken or stored so many years ago, or\n\nwhere, so many years later, they could even begin looking for them beyond the locations they\n\nhave already searched. Benear Decl. at ¶ 14. The Court finds this claim reasonable. Although\n\n“there may be times when an agency’s inability to retrieve documents known or thought to be in\n\n\n\n        6\n          The Court notes that, as part of their argument that the Army has not conducted\nadequate searches, Plaintiffs request the Court “consider using its discretion to conduct in\ncamera review of a selected sample of the records that remain withheld” and “appoint a Special\nMaster.” Pls.’ Mot. at 42-43; see also Pls.’ Reply at 15. Because the Court herein rejects\nPlaintiffs’ attempts to challenge the adequacy of the Army’s searches, and reaffirms its finding\nthat adequate searches have been conducted, the Court will take neither of these steps.\n                                                   13\n\fits files is inherently unbelievable,” Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1351 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1983), given the considerable amount of years that have passed since these documents were\n\nmicrofilmed, this is not one of those times.\n\n       Regardless of whether Defendants can say definitively what particular documents were\n\nreplaced by these “Replacement Sheets,” whether those documents still exist, or where those\n\ndocuments are, the relevant question remains, as in all FOIA cases, merely whether the Army has\n\nconducted an adequate search for responsive documents. As the Court of Appeals has\n\nconcluded, “[t]he declarations from the Army and the National Archives describe searches of\n\nArmy records reasonably calculated to discover all documents responsive to Oglesby’s request,”\n\nand, in fact, “[t]hose searches have looked further and wider than FOIA requires.” DiBacco, 795\n\nF.3d at 191. Accordingly, if the documents replaced by these “Replacement Sheets” still exist,\n\nand if they are in fact responsive to Oglesby’s FOIA requests, the Army presumably would have\n\nfound them in its searches, which it has declared covered all “locations that might contain\n\nresponsive records.” DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 190. This is all FOIA requires of the Army. 7\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs argue that the production of the 2,863 pages at issue here indicates an\n\ninadequate search because “[t]here were 9,000 Army records that were produced before year\n\n2000.” Pls.’ Mot. at 41-42. Plaintiffs argue that “the Army and NARA need to account for why\n\nthese records have not been given to DiBacco as part of the NWCDA release.” Id. at 42.\n\nDefendants have, however, accounted for this perceived discrepancy. The reason why Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         To the extent Plaintiffs contend Defendants have any additional duty to produce these\ndocuments simply because they were referenced in the records produced to Plaintiffs, they are\nwrong. “[O]ur Court of Appeals has made clear that agencies do not need to examine every\ncrossreferenced document uncovered after an initial disclosure.” Elec.

Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 22; Decl. of Martha Wagner Murphy, ECF No. [240-2] (“Murphy Decl.”), at\n\n¶¶ 12-17. Digitized files constituted only a small portion of the overall universe of Army records\n\nthat were transferred to NARA, Final Report at 52-54, and the 9,000 records referenced by\n\nPlaintiffs apparently were not limited to digitized files. Accordingly, the discrepancy\n\nhighlighted by Plaintiffs has been explained, is justified, and is not a reason to deny summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Army needs to run additional searches because “[t]he\n\nGovernment has conceded that Army had a copy, indeed multiple copies” of records that it\n\ntransferred to NARA. Pls.’ Mot. at 42. This is also not a reason to deny summary judgment on\n\nthe search issue. Apparently the Army did keep a copy of the documents it had selected as\n\nresponsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests at a much earlier stage in this litigation, before\n\ntransferring all of its original Investigative Records Repository (“IRR”) records to NARA.\n\nDefs.’ Stmt. ¶¶ 17-18; Pls.’ Ex. 5, ECF No. [330-5] (December 19, 2014 Letter from Ronald C.\n\nMachen Jr. to Mark J. Langer); Benear Decl. ¶¶ 5-6 . But this fact is of no help to Plaintiffs. If\n\nall that the Army has maintained is a copy of the set of documents it already located and\n\ndetermined were responsive to Oglesby’s requests, there are no additional original documents for\n\nthe Army to search.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs raise a number of challenges that do not appear to relate in any way to\n\nthe release of redacted Army records during the latest appeal, and are accordingly outside of the\n\nscope of the remand in this case. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants should have searched certain\n\n                                                 15\n\f“dossiers” listed in a book written by Linda Hunt, that NARA has not searched for certain\n\nproject files or archival materials stored in Arlington, Virginia, and that “it is unclear whether the\n\nCIA has ever accounted for” certain materials the FBI referred to the CIA “when the FBI was\n\nstill active in this case.” Pls.’ Mot. at 38. The Court need not resolve these arguments. The\n\nCourt of Appeals’ mandate to this Court stated that “[t]he remand is limited to the issues arising\n\nfrom the Army’s release to DiBacco during the appeal of responsive but redacted Army\n\ndocuments that had been held by the National Archives.” Mandate, ECF No. [275]. Because\n\nthese miscellaneous arguments regarding the adequacy of various Defendants’ searches are not\n\nwithin this mandate, they are not properly before the Court. 8\n\n       Accordingly, having found that none of Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the adequacy of\n\nthe Army’s search—in conjunction with NARA—have merit, the Court grants Defendants\n\nsummary judgment on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          In a letter to the Court of Appeals during the latest appeal, Plaintiffs raised a number of\nadditional miscellaneous deficiencies they perceived with the copy of digitized Army records\nthey had received. Ex. A to Defs.’ Response to the Court’s Order of November 20, 2015, ECF\nNo. [296-1] (April 8, 2015 Letter from James H. Lesar to Mark J. Langer). It is unclear whether\nPlaintiffs continue to press those arguments in their cross-motion for summary judgment, but the\nCourt notes that they would similarly not be grounds for denying Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment. Defendants have provided uncontested explanations for these perceived\nproblems. For example, the backside of certain documents appear to not have been microfilmed\ndue to an error of the microfilmer long before the passage of the FOIA, Benear Decl. ¶ 15, and\nwhat appeared to Plaintiffs to be redactions on certain documents were in fact the effect of\nstaples being photocopied, id. ¶ 9. These minor and explainable issues regarding the quality of\ndocuments microfilmed long ago clearly has no effect on the adequacy of Defendants’ search, or\nany other legal issue in this case. Additionally, Plaintiffs at times throughout this and prior\nbriefing have suggested that certain “dossiers” show that there is responsive material that has not\nbeen provided to them, but Plaintiffs present no adequate explanation of, or support for, this\nassertion, which the Court accordingly rejects.\n                                                  16\n\fB. Redactions on Army Records Produced During Appeal\n\n        The records released to Plaintiffs after the oral argument before the Court of Appeals in\n\n2014 include 2,863 pages. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 26; Murphy Decl. ¶ 17. Of those 2,863, redactions now\n\nappear on the face of 10 pages. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 33; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 33. The redactions\n\nhave been made at the request of the CIA, and are made pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3.\n\nSee generally Decl. of Mary E. Wilson, ECF No. [296-4] (“Wilson Decl.”). Most of the redactions\n\nare very minimal. See Wilson Decl., Ex. A. Despite the minimal nature of these redactions,\n\nhowever, Plaintiffs contend that the FOIA exemptions have been misapplied and that summary\n\njudgment for Defendants is still not warranted. The Court considers Defendants’ showing and\n\nPlaintiffs’ arguments with respect to each exemption in turn.\n\n        1. Exemption 1\n\n        Several redactions to the 10 pages still at issue have been justified by Defendants, in part,\n\nas properly withheld under FOIA Exemption 1. Exemption 1 provides that agencies may withhold\n\nrecords that are “(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be\n\nkept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified\n\npursuant to such Executive order.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1). The parties apparently agree that the\n\nrelevant Executive Order for the purposes of Defendants’ current Exemption 1 withholdings is\n\nExecutive Order 13526. Pls.’ Mot. at 19; Defs.’ Mot. at 26.

Pls.’ Mot. at 19.\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\f           a. Whether The Withheld Information Is Properly Classified Substantively\n\n       First, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ various attempts to undermine Defendants’ showing\n\nthat the documents were properly classified under Executive Order 13526’s substantive criteria.\n\nThat criteria requires that classified information pertain to at least one of the Executive Order’s\n\nsubject-matter classification categories and that “disclosure of that information [ ] reasonably be\n\nexpected to cause some degree of harm to national security.” Judicial Watch, 715 F.3d at 941.\n\n       Defendants have provided the declaration of Mary E. Wilson to carry their burden of\n\nshowing that the withheld information was properly classified. Wilson Decl. Ms. Wilson states\n\nthat she is the Acting Information Review Officer for the Litigation Information Review Office\n\nat the CIA. Id. ¶ 1. In that role, Ms. Wilson holds original classification authority. Id. ¶ 3.\n\n       Ms. Wilson states that she has reviewed the documents and “determined that some of the\n\ninformation contained in the documents at issue is currently and properly classified.” Id. ¶ 9.\n\nAttached to Ms. Wilson’s declaration is a copy of each document with labels indicating what\n\nportions of the document are classified. Id., Ex. A. Ms. Wilson states that the information that\n\nremains redacted falls within Executive Order 13526’s classification categories, including\n\n“intelligence activities . . . intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology,” or “foreign relations\n\nor foreign activities of the United States.” Id. ¶ 14. Ms. Wilson also states that the\n\n“unauthorized disclosure of the information “would reasonably be expected to result in serious\n\ndamage to the U.S. national security.” Id. Specifically, Ms. Wilson explains that the withheld\n\ninformation “pertains to specific CIA intelligence methods still in use, including cover\n\nmechanisms; information regarding foreign liaison relationships; and cities and countries in\n\nwhich CIA maintained covert CIA installations,” and that the release of such information would\n\nresult in the harm described in the previous declaration of Martha M. Lutz. Id. ¶ 15. In a\n\n                                                  18\n\fdeclaration filed earlier in this litigation, Ms. Lutz, the then-Chief of the Litigation Support Unit\n\nof the CIA, explained in detail the harm that results from disclosure of such classified CIA\n\ninformation. Decl. of Martha M. Lutz, ECF No. [240-5] (“Lutz Decl.”). Ms. Lutz explained that\n\nrevealing intelligence sources, even years later, makes it more difficult for the United States to\n\ncreate and maintain confidential intelligence relationships. Id. ¶¶ 36-40. Revealing intelligence\n\nmethods or the information produced by those methods reduces their effectiveness and allows\n\nhostile entities to penetrate, detect, prevent, damage or otherwise neutralize United States\n\nintelligence operations. Id. ¶¶ 41-52. The Court is satisfied by this articulation of potential harm\n\nfrom disclosure. See Am. Civil Liberties, 628 F.3d at 626 (approving of similar explanations of\n\nharm from the release of CIA information in support of Exemption 1 claim).\n\n       Accordingly, based on the explanation provided by Ms. Wilson and Ms. Lutz, the general\n\nnature of the records at issue, and the non-redacted context in those records, and bearing in mind\n\nthat “in the context of national security concerns, courts must accord substantial weight to an\n\nagency’s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record,” Wolf v.\n\nC.I.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186834\"><a href=\"/opinion/186834/wolf-paul-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (D.C.

For example, Plaintiffs fault the Wilson declaration for not indicating whether the\n\nredacted intelligence mechanisms are known to foreign governments, whether installations are\n\nknown to the countries in which they are installed, and whether human intelligence sources are\n\n                                                 19\n\fstill alive. Pls.’ Mot. at 31. Plaintiffs also fault the Wilson declaration for not providing the\n\ntopics discussed at a certain meeting, the minutes of which are mostly redacted from one of the\n\nrecently-provided Army documents. Id. at 28. The Court accepts that some of this information\n\ncould be relevant in a Vaughn index relating to classified CIA information, but the Court is not\n\npersuaded that Ms. Wilson’s failure to include all of this information renders her declaration\n\ninsufficient. “If an agency’s statements supporting exemption contain reasonable specificity of\n\ndetail as to demonstrate that the withheld information logically falls within the claimed\n\nexemption and evidence in the record does not suggest otherwise . . . the court should not\n\nconduct a more detailed inquiry to test the agency’s judgment and expertise or to evaluate\n\nwhether the court agrees with the agency’s opinions.” Larson v. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187372\"><a href=\"/opinion/187372/larson-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n865 (D.C. Cir. 2009). As discussed above, Defendants have provided declarations that\n\nadequately explain why the withheld information is properly classified under Executive Order\n\n13526, and therefore exempt under Exemption 1. None of the information Plaintiffs fault\n\nDefendant for not providing was required to accomplish this, and accordingly the absence of this\n\ninformation does not preclude summary judgment for Defendants.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs argue that by releasing additional information after the most recent\n\nreview of the records at issue conducted by Ms. Wilson, Defendants have implicitly undermined\n\nthe redactions originally made by Ms. Lutz. Pls.’ Mot. at 25. Plaintiffs argue that the “clear\n\nimplication” is that another round of review would result in the disclosure of even more\n\ninformation. Id. This argument is baseless and ignores the reasonable explanation for the further\n\nrelease of information Defendants have already provided. Ms. Wilson explained that these\n\nfurther releases were the result of the fact that at the time the former CIA Information Review\n\nOfficer, Ms. Lutz, had conducted her review of the documents, Executive Order 13526’s 50-year\n\n                                                  20\n\fmandatory declassification provision had not yet come into effect. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 30; Pls.’ Resp.\n\nto Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 30. That provision had come into effect by the time Ms. Wilson conducted her\n\nreview. Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 31; Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Stmt. ¶ 31. It was for this reason that more\n\ninformation could be released after Ms. Wilson’s review. This in no way indicates that another\n\nreview would result in the disclosure of even more information. Plaintiffs cast no serious doubt\n\non this explanation, which the Court accepts as accurate. See Hodge v. F.B.I., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">703</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (rejecting plaintiff’s argument that the fact that “documents contained fewer\n\nredactions when released to [plaintiff] a second time . . . demonstrates that the FBI is improperly\n\nwithholding material”).\n\n       Third, Plaintiffs argue that the credibility of Ms. Wilson’s classification of the records at\n\nissue as “Secret” is undermined by “the fact that she claims that the information is so super-\n\ndamaging to national security that it qualifies for exemption from automatic declassification.”\n\nPls.’ Mot. at 26. In other words, Plaintiffs contend that information being classified as “Secret”\n\nis inconsistent with that same information being exempted from automatic declassification after\n\n50 years under Executive Order 13526. Id. Again, this argument is misguided. Plaintiffs point\n\nto no basis in Executive Order 13526 for the argument that the CIA may not propose to exempt\n\nfrom automatic declassification information that is only classified as “Secret.” Executive Order\n\n13526 merely states that “[i]n extraordinary cases, agency heads may, within 5 years of the onset\n\nof automatic declassification, propose to exempt additional specific information from\n\ndeclassification at 50 years,” so long as the agency head or other senior agency official notifies\n\nthe Director of the Information Security Oversight Office of such a proposal, and it is approved.\n\nE.O. 13526 §§ 3.3(h)(2), 3.3(j). Here, the Director of the CIA proposed to exempt additional\n\ninformation in a “CIA Declassification Guide” dated September 26, 2012. Wilson Decl. ¶ 16.\n\n                                                 21\n\fThe Guide specifically called for the exemption of information that “could reveal: a relationship\n\nor a former relationship with an intelligence or security service of a foreign government or\n\ninternational organization, a nonhuman intelligence source in active use, or an intelligence\n\nmethod in active use.” Id. ¶ 17. The Guide was approved through an appeals process provided\n\nfor in Executive Order 13526. Ms. Wilson states that the withheld information—which relates to\n\nCIA foreign liaison relationships and cities and countries in which the CIA maintained covert\n\ninstallations—is exempt from automatic disclosure pursuant to these approved categories of\n\nexemption. Id. ¶ 20. Accordingly, Defendants have sufficiently shown that the redacted\n\ninformation continues to be properly classified despite the automatic disclosure requirements of\n\nExecutive Order 13526, and the fact that it is classified as “Secret” is irrelevant to this analysis.\n\n       Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that if the redacted information was indeed exempted from\n\nautomatic declassification under Executive Order 13526, section 3.3(j)(1) of that Order required\n\nthat “an agency head or senior agency official [ ] notify the Director of the Information Security\n\nOversight Office . . . of any specific information that the agency proposes to exempt.” Pls.’ Mot.\n\nat 27. That notification was required to include a detailed description of the proposed-exempt\n\ninformation, an explanation of why it should be exempt, and a specific date or event upon which\n\nthe agency proposes automatic declassification eventually to occur. E.O. 13526 § 3.3(j)(1).\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Ms. Wilson’s declaration does not provide all of this information. Id.\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument misses the point of section 3.3(j)(1). This section requires the agency head\n\nor other senior agency official to provide the listed information to the Director of the Information\n\nSecurity Oversight Office as part of the notification process for proposals of additional categories\n\nof information to exempt from automatic disclosure after 50 years. It does not require that this\n\ninformation be given to Plaintiffs or any other individuals who request the exempted documents.\n\n                                                  22\n\fDefendants were, of course, required to provide Plaintiffs and the Court with a reasonably\n\ndetailed explanation of why the redacted information was properly classified and therefore\n\nwithheld, Am. Civil Liberties, 628 F.3d at 619, but that does not require Ms. Wilson to include in\n\nher declaration all of the information the CIA provided to the Director as part of its proposal to\n\nexempt information under section 3.3(j). Ms. Wilson states, and Plaintiffs do not meaningfully\n\nrebut, that such a proposal was made, and that it was eventually approved. This is sufficient.\n\n       Fifth, Plaintiffs contend that “if the withheld material is of such super-importance that its\n\nwithholding must be prolonged beyond even the current 56 years, then one is surprised that the\n\namount of material withheld is so minimal. This is inconsistent with what one would expect.”\n\nPls.’ Mot. at 29. Little need be said about this argument. The fact that only minimal redactions\n\nhave been made to the records is completely irrelevant to the question of whether the information\n\nredacted is properly classified under Executive Order 13526. “Minimal” amounts of information\n\ncan, of course, be significant and properly classified. As Plaintiffs themselves point out, the\n\nredactions in this case “are ‘minimal’ in terms of size, but not in terms of significance.” Pls.’\n\nMot. at 28 n.13. If anything, the minimal nature of the redactions evinces a careful,\n\ndiscriminating review and suggests that Defendants took seriously their obligation to release\n\nnon-exempt and reasonably segregable portions of documents.\n\n       Having rejected all of Plaintiffs’ arguments on these points, the Court concludes that\n\nDefendants have satisfied their burden of showing that the redacted material is properly\n\nclassified under the substantive criteria of Executive Order 13526.\n\n           b. Whether The Withheld Information Is Properly Classified Procedurally\n\n       Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants failed to show that the redacted information was\n\nclassified according to the procedural requirements of Executive Order 13526. Pls.’ Mot. at 19.\n\n                                                 23\n\fIn addition to satisfying an Executive Order’s substantive criteria, “[t]o be classified properly, a\n\ndocument must be classified in accordance with the procedural criteria of the governing Executive\n\nOrder.” Lesar v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 483 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe information here was not properly classified under the procedural requirements of Executive\n\nOrder 13526 because the redacted documents “do not show any of the classification markings that\n\nshould have been applied as a result of a review under either E.O. 12958 or E.O. 13526.” Pls.’\n\nMot. at 19.\n\n       Although more substantial than Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding Executive Order 13526’s\n\nsubstantive criteria, this argument also fails.       Defendants appear to concede that certain\n\nclassification markings are missing on these documents, Defs.’ Mot. at 31, but claim that, under\n\nthe circumstances, these procedural errors do not prevent Defendants from claiming protection\n\nunder Exemption 1. The Court agrees. As an initial matter, the first sentence of section 1.6(f) of\n\nExecutive Order 13526 expressly states that “[i]nformation assigned a level of classification under\n\nthis or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the\n\nomission of other required markings.” E.O. 13526 § 1.6(f) (emphasis added). As has been\n\ndescribed earlier in this litigation, the records at issue in this case were classified many years ago\n\npursuant to past Executive Orders. According to the plain language of Executive Order 13526\n\nthen, the omission of markings on these documents that would be required under the present\n\nExecutive Order is not controlling. 9\n\n\n\n       9\n         This conclusion is not affected by the second sentence of section 1.6(f), which reads that\n“[w]henever such information is used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed for\npossible declassification, holders of such information shall coordinate with an appropriate\nclassification authority for the application omitted markings.” E.O. 13526 § 1.6(f). Plaintiffs\nargue that because Ms. Wilson does not state that any such coordination or retroactive\napplication of omitted markings has occurred, the lack of markings renders the classification of\n                                                  24\n\f       Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that certain unspecified markings required under\n\npast Executive Orders are missing, the Court finds that such procedural error would not undermine\n\nDefendants’ classification decision so as to preclude reliance on Exemption 1. Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the Court cannot excuse any absence of markings because “interpreting Exemption 1\n\naccording to the plain meaning of the statute requires that an agency meet its burden under\n\nExemption 1(A) and 1(B) separately.” Pls.’ Mot. at 21. By this Plaintiffs appear to mean that to\n\nexcuse any procedural errors in the classification of records would be to ignore part (B) of\n\nExemption 1, which requires that information withheld have been “in fact properly classified\n\npursuant to such Executive order.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1). The Court disagrees that any procedural\n\nerror nullifies the classification of information for the purposes of claiming protection under\n\nExemption 1. As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, “the consequences of particular violations may\n\nvary . . . [f]or procedural violations, some may be of such importance to reflect adversely on the\n\nagency’s overall classification decision, requiring a remand to the district court for in camera\n\ninspection; while others may be insignificant, undermining not at all the agency’s classification\n\ndecision.” Lesar, 636 F.2d at 485. In Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., the D.C. Circuit\n\ndetermined that the absence of required markings on classified documents did not prevent the court\n\nfrom finding that said documents were properly classified, and accordingly withheld under\n\nExemption 1, where the documents fit within the substantive standards of the Executive Order and\n\n“a person with original classification authority has approved the classification decision.” Judicial\n\n\n\nthe documents ineffective. Defendants argue that, to the contrary, the second sentence of section\n1.6(f) is merely a “procedural requirement for correcting an error in marking classified\ninformation.” Defs.’ Mot. at 32. Defendants have the better argument. The Court does not\ninterpret the second sentence of section 1.6(f) as providing that failure to coordinate and correct\nthe errors undermines the classification of the information, which the first sentence of the Order\nstates is effective despite omitted markings.\n                                                 25\n\fWatch, 715 F.3d at 944. In such a situation, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the alleged procedural\n\nerror “would not ‘reflect adversely on the agency’s overall classification decision.’” Id. (quoting\n\nLesar, 636 F. 2d at 484, 485). 10\n\n       Here, as discussed above, the Court has found that the redacted information fits within the\n\nsubstantive criteria of Executive Order 13526. The original classification process appears to have\n\noccurred decades ago and, to the extent certain markings were not applied correctly at that time,\n\nMs. Wilson—who has original classification authority—has now stated that she has reviewed the\n\ninformation and determined that it is properly classified at the “Secret” level under Executive\n\nOrder 13526 as of today. Wilson Decl. ¶ 9. In this situation, the Court is not persuaded that any\n\nmarkings Plaintiffs claim have been omitted reflect adversely on the agency’s classification\n\ndecision such that the Court should find that the redacted information was improperly withheld.\n\nSee Canning v.

Circuit case law on\nthis subject. Accordingly, to the extent Lesar and Judicial Watch are inconsistent with the\nGoland dissent, the Court’s analysis has been guided by the former opinions.\n                                                   26\n\ffailure to comply with Section 1.6 of E.O. 13,526 should not ‘reflect adversely on the agency’s\n\noverall classification decision.’”) (quoting Judicial Watch, 715 F.3d at 944). 11\n\n        In sum, Ms. Wilson’s declaration—incorporating in part Ms. Lutz’s prior declaration—\n\nestablishes with a reasonable level of specificity that the information at issue was properly\n\nclassified under Executive Order 13526, and thus was properly withheld under FOIA Exemption\n\n1. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\n        2. Exemption 3\n\n        Even if the redactions had not been properly made pursuant to Exemption 1, summary\n\njudgment for Defendants would nevertheless be appropriate because Defendants have satisfied\n\ntheir burden of showing that all redactions at issue were also proper under FOIA Exemption 3.\n\nExemption 3 permits an agency to withhold information “specifically exempted from disclosure\n\nby statute (other than section 552b of this title),” if the relevant statute\n\n        (A)     (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as\n        to leave no discretion on the issue; or\n\n                (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types\n                of matters to be withheld; and\n\n        (B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009,\n        specifically cites to this paragraph.\n\nId. § 552(b)(3). “When analyzing whether the defendant is entitled to invoke Exemption 3, the\n\ncourt need not examine ‘the detailed factual contents of specific documents’ withheld; rather, ‘the\n\n\n\n        11\n         To the extent Plaintiffs also argue that the information was not properly classified\nprocedurally because the CIA did not follow the procedures to exempt the information from\nautomatic disclosure after 50 years, this argument mirrors Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding\nExecutive Order 13526’s substantive criteria and has already been addressed above.

First, with respect to the National Security Act, Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat the Court should have “considerable skepticism” about these claims of exemption because it\n\nis “well-established that both the KGB and MI-6 had thoroughly infiltrated the Gehlen\n\nOrganization.” Pls.’ Mot. at 35. Plaintiffs apparently suggest that the CIA is merely attempting\n\nto keep the redacted information secret to protect itself from the embarrassment that would ensue\n\nif this infiltration became public. Id. As support, Plaintiffs point to portions of the IWG Final\n\nReport which criticized the CIA for not being forthcoming with Congress with regard to CIA\n\nactivity after World War II. Id.\n\n       This vague assertion of “skepticism,” Pls.’ Mot. at 36, regarding Defendants’ Exemption\n\n3 claims is far from sufficient grounds upon which to deny Defendants summary judgment. The\n\nmere fact that the Final Report claims that the CIA had acted uncooperatively in the past is clearly\n\ninsufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to the CIA’s statements regarding withholdings in\n\nthis case. Moreover, Plaintiffs present an incomplete and misleading depiction of the Final Report.\n\nThe only portions of the Final Report cited by Plaintiffs that discuss CIA conduct with any\n\nsignificant degree of disapproval concern the CIA’s cooperation with Congress in the 1980s and\n\n1990s. Final Report at 18. The Final Report, which was published in 2007, goes on to conclude\n\nthat “[u]ltimately, the IWG convinced the CIA to be forthcoming to an unprecedented extent in\n\nreleasing information.” Id. at 45. Accordingly, even if the Court were to read as much into the\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fFinal Report as Plaintiffs request, that report shows, if anything, that the CIA has been forthcoming\n\nand cooperative in the present era.\n\n       Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have misapplied the CIA Act because that Act\n\napplies only to “personnel information.” Pls.’ Mot. at 32-33.

These limitations do not, however, provide\n\nany support for Plaintiffs’ argument that the CIA Act redactions in this case are improper because\n\nthe redacted records are not “personnel records.” Pls.’ Mot. at 33 (emphasis added). Clearly,\n\npersonnel “information,” such as the “the names of personnel, the titles and salaries of personnel,\n\nor how personnel are organized within the CIA,” Nat’l Sec. Counselors, 960 F. Supp. 2d at 175,\n\ncan exist on documents that are not “personnel records.” Accordingly, the fact that the redactions\n\nare made on the “the kind of records normally generated in gathering and disseminating\n\nintelligence information” does not show that the redacted information is not protected from\n\ndisclosure under the CIA Act.\n\n                                                 30\n\f       Third, Plaintiffs contend that “a deceased employee is not an employee under the statute”\n\nand that “[e]ven assuming that some of the withheld information is personnel material, no showing\n\nhas been made by Lutz that these persons are still employed by the CIA.” Pls.’ Mot. at 34.\n\nPlaintiffs point to no support for the proposition that a deceased employee is not covered by the\n\nCIA Act, and it finds no support in the plain language of the statute or case law. The statute states\n\nthat the CIA shall be exempt from disclosing “the organization, functions, names, official titles,\n\nsalaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency.” 12 50 U.S.C. § 3507. This language\n\nis not limited to information related to individuals currently employed by the CIA. To the contrary,\n\nthe Court finds that “deceased former employees still fall within the plain language of [§ 3507] as\n\nhaving been ‘employed’ by the CIA.” Hall v. C.I.A., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\n       Finally, in this section of Plaintiffs’ cross-motion Plaintiffs makes various references to the\n\n2013 Lutz Declaration and corresponding Vaughn index, and challenge certain redactions\n\nexplained therein. For example, Plaintiffs state that “[w]hat is true of the withholdings addressed\n\nby Wilson is also true of the material withheld under this Exemption 3 claim in the Vaughn indices\n\nattached to the Lutz declarations.” Pls.’ Mot. at 33. Plaintiffs also fault Defendants for not\n\nresponding to Plaintiffs’ “citation of the first entry in the Lutz Vaughn index as a misuse of the\n\nNSA Act ‘sources and methods’ claim.” Id. at 36. These arguments are irrelevant because they\n\nare outside the scope of the Court of Appeals’ remand in this case. As discussed above, the Court\n\nof Appeals’ mandate to this Court stated that “[t]he remand is limited to the issues arising from\n\nthe Army’s release to DiBacco during the appeal of responsive but redacted Army documents that\n\n\n       12\n          Plaintiffs argue in their Reply that the plain language of the statute supports their\ninterpretation because “the plain meaning of ‘employee’ is a person who is working for\nsomeone.” Pls.’ Reply at 9. But the relevant statutory language refers not to “employees” but to\n“personnel employed by the Agency.” 50 U.S.C. § 3507 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                 31\n\fhad been held by the National Archives.” Mandate, ECF No. 275.             Because the redactions\n\ndiscussed in the Lutz declaration are not within this mandate, they are not before the Court.\n\n       In sum, the Court finds that Defendants have carried their burden of showing that the\n\nredacted material is exempt from disclosure under Exemption 3 pursuant to the National Security\n\nAct and the CIA Act. Defendants are accordingly entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n\n       3. Segregability\n\n       Finally, the Court finds that Defendants have satisfied their burden of demonstrating that\n\nno nonexempt and reasonably segregable information has been withheld. “[E]ven if the agency\n\nestablishes an exemption, it must nonetheless disclose all reasonably segregable, nonexempt\n\nportions of the requested record(s).” Roth v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219828\"><a href=\"/opinion/219828/roth-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1167 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011) (citation omitted). “Agencies are entitled to a presumption that they complied with the\n\nobligation to disclose reasonably segregable material.” Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186972\"><a href=\"/opinion/186972/sussman-v-us-marshals-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n       Defendants have submitted a declaration from Antoinette B. Shiner, the Information\n\nReview Officer for the Litigation Information Review Office at the CIA—an individual who holds\n\noriginal classification authority—in which Ms. Shiner states that she has “conducted a document-\n\nby-document and line-by-line review of the records at issue in this case and ha[s] determined that\n\nall reasonably segregable nonexempt information has been released to plaintiffs.” Decl. of\n\nAntoinette B. Shiner, ECF No. [344-1] (“Shiner Decl.”), at ¶ 5. The Court notes that Plaintiffs\n\nargued in their opposition to Defendants’ Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment that Ms.\n\nWilson’s declaration did “not state, much less show, that there are no segregable portions\n\nremaining.”   Pls.’ Mot. at 31.     Accordingly, the Court ordered Defendants to provide a\n\nsupplemental declaration specifically addressing segregability, which Defendants did by filing the\n\n                                                32\n\fShiner Declaration on January 11, 2017. The Court gave Plaintiffs the opportunity to respond to\n\nthe Shiner Declaration, which they did on January 13, 2017. Pls.’ Resp. to Court’s Order of\n\nJanuary 11, 2017, ECF No. [345]. Plaintiffs raised a number of arguments regarding the adequacy\n\nof Ms. Shiner’s declaration, none of which were persuasive. Plaintiffs argued that Defendants had\n\nnot proffered a “plausible explanation” as to why this declaration was submitted by Ms. Shiner, as\n\nopposed to Ms. Wilson submitting a supplemental declaration. Id. at 1-2. But Defendants have\n\noffered such an explanation: Ms. Shiner replaced Ms. Wilson as Information Review Officer\n\nshortly after Ms. Wilson executed the declaration discussed elsewhere in this Memorandum\n\nOpinion. The Court also rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that Ms. Shiner’s declaration does not comply\n\nwith Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, given that Ms. Shiner declares that her statements are\n\nbased on her own line-by-line review of the documents at issue. Shiner Decl. ¶ 5. The remainder\n\nof Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the adequacy of the Shiner Declaration simply rehash points\n\nmade in Plaintiffs’ other pleadings, which have been addressed as necessary in this Opinion.\n\nMostly, Plaintiffs fault Ms. Shiner for not addressing all of the various substantive issues related\n\nto Defendants’ claims under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, but this argument ignores the fact that the\n\nShiner Declaration was submitted in response to a Court order that only requested from Defendants\n\na narrow declaration on their position as to the segregability of any nonexempt information\n\nredacted from the records at issue. 1/5/2017 Minute Order.\n\n       The Court concludes that the Shiner Declaration, in concert with Ms. Wilson’s declaration\n\nwhich was submitted by Defendants to act as a Vaughn index, and the Court’s review of the narrow\n\nredactions at issue, is sufficient to persuade the Court that no nonexempt and reasonably segregable\n\ninformation has been withheld.

Office for U.S. Attorneys, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185805\"><a href=\"/opinion/185805/johnson-neil-v-exec-off-us-atty/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776\n\n(D.C.

C.I.A., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (D.D.C. 2013), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“an agency may satisfy its segregability obligations by (1) providing a\n\nVaughn index that adequately describes each withheld document and the exemption under which\n\nit was withheld; and (2) submitting a declaration attesting that the agency released all segregable\n\nmaterial.”).\n\n       Plaintiffs offer no evidence or persuasive argument to rebut the presumption that no\n\nreasonably segregable information has been withheld. Plaintiffs’ only arguments that the Court\n\ninterprets as relating to segregability focus on a document containing minutes from a June 15, 1960\n\nmeeting of BND officials, found at page 30 of Exhibit A to the Wilson Declaration. Although\n\nconsiderably more information has been withheld from this document than has been withheld from\n\nthe other documents at issue, the extent of the redactions itself is not sufficient to overcome the\n\npresumption of compliance with the agency’s obligation to produce reasonably segregable\n\ninformation. Indeed, the Court finds that, in this case, “given the sensitive nature” of the\n\ndocuments at issue, “it is unsurprising that [the] document[ ] would be heavily redacted.” Hodge,\n\n703 F.3d at 582. Beyond the mere fact that a fairly substantial portion of the document has been\n\nredacted, Plaintiffs’ attempts to show that the document contains some redacted nonexempt\n\ninformation are unpersuasive. For example, the document apparently contains the “significant\n\npoints discussed” at the meeting, and the author of the document recommends not raising point\n\n‘b’—which is redacted—with “top officials.” Wilson Decl., Ex. A at 30. From this, Plaintiffs\n\nderive that the author believed that the redacted point ‘b’ was “more sensitive” than a redacted\n\npoint ‘a,’ and therefore, Plaintiffs argue, it is suspicious that both points would be classified at the\n\nsame level. Pls.’ Mot. at 30. It is not. Even accepting Plaintiffs’ unfounded assumption that the\n\n                                                  34\n\fauthor’s recommendation of not bringing one of the redacted points to the attention of “top\n\nofficials” was driven by his or her belief that that point was “more sensitive” than the other,\n\nPlaintiffs’ argument fails because of course both points could still be properly classified or\n\nwithheld under the standards of Exemptions 1 or 3 regardless of their varying degrees of\n\n“sensitivity.” In short, none of Plaintiffs’ arguments alter the Court’s conclusion that Defendants\n\nhave satisfied their burden of showing that no reasonably segregable nonexempt information has\n\nbeen withheld, from this or any other document at issue.\n\nC. Miscellaneous Points\n\n       Finally, the Court briefly addresses some miscellaneous points raised by the parties in\n\ntheir briefing. First, Plaintiffs have included in their cross-motion for summary judgment and\n\nreply brief lengthy descriptions of their theory that a German double agent, Werner von\n\nAlvensleben, was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Pls.’ Mot. a 4-10;\n\nPls.’ Reply at 1-4. Plaintiffs claim that von Alvensleben learned the trade of political\n\nassassination from his father, a member of the Prussian noble Junker family, and later conspired\n\nto kill President Kennedy with the owner of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Id.\n\nThis lengthy discussion is irrelevant to the factual and legal issues raised by the pending motions\n\nand accordingly is not helpful to the Court. The Court rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that these\n\nassertions—most of which are not supported by any factual citation—make summary judgment\n\n“inappropriate.” Pls.’ Mot. at 10. Plaintiffs complain that they have not received records related\n\nto von Alvensleben, but Plaintiffs do not explain why such records would be responsive to\n\nOglesby’s FOIA requests, which requested information from a different time frame and related\n\nto different individuals. Moreover, even if they were responsive, “the fact that a particular\n\ndocument was not found does not demonstrate the inadequacy of a search,” Boyd v. Criminal\n\n                                                35\n\fDiv. of U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186862\"><a href=\"/opinion/186862/boyd-willie-e-v-cr-div-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and accordingly the Court\n\nwould not find that any Defendants’ searches were inadequate simply because Plaintiffs are\n\ndisappointed that they did not receive documents pertaining to this individual. Finally, as with\n\nother miscellaneous issues raised by Plaintiffs, this issue is clearly not within the Court of\n\nAppeals’ narrow remand. The Court will also not “order the government to investigate the\n\ninformation on this topic provided by plaintiffs and report back to the Court and the parties.”\n\nPls.’ Mot. at 45. Ordering the investigation of a particular theory regarding President Kennedy’s\n\nassassination is, of course, not the Court’s proper role under the FOIA. See Mobley, 924 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 51-52 (“[I]t is not the Court’s proper place to decide who should or should not be the\n\nsubject of intelligence gathering activities.”).\n\n        The Court also acknowledges that the parties dispute whether the continuation of this\n\ncase benefits the public and serves the purposes of the FOIA. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\n\nhave not recently made efforts to share the documents they have received with the public, and\n\ncomplain that this case has veered off track, with Plaintiffs now raising arguments about various\n\nsubstantive issues irrelevant in a FOIA case. Defs.’ Mot. at 38-41; Defs.’ Opp’n at 2-5, 7-8.\n\nPlaintiffs respond that prior-Plaintiff Oglesby had been reviewing the documents released in this\n\ncase as late as 2008, and “had been in contact with the undersigned counsel about his work on\n\nthe Gehlen Org” in 2011. Pls.’ Mot. at 43. Plaintiffs also claim that “undersigned counsel has\n\npersonally distributed copies of the released materials to researchers deeply interested in the\n\nsubject.” Id. The Court acknowledges that this case has persisted for a lengthy period and that,\n\nas discussed above, certain portions of Plaintiffs’ briefing are irrelevant to the legal issues\n\nactually remaining before the Court. Accordingly, the Court has only herein addressed those\n\npoints that are necessary to resolve the remaining arguments regarding the minimal redactions\n\n                                                   36\n\fstill at issue in this case and bring this dispute to a close. The Court has not, however, rested its\n\ndecision to grant summary judgment for Defendants on the duration or perceived lack of public\n\nbenefit of this case.\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary\n\njudgment on all remaining issues. The documents that were released to Plaintiffs during the\n\nlatest appeal do not demonstrate that Defendants’ search for responsive documents was\n\ninadequate, and the minimal redactions made to those documents are justified under FOIA\n\nExemptions 1 and 3. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ [327] Renewed Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment and DENIES Plaintiffs’ [330] Renewed Motion for Partial Summary\n\nJudgment and Other Relief. An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\nDated: January 18, 2017\n                                                          /s/\n                                                       COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                                       United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                  37\n\f</pre>",
