Adams and Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Company, L.L.C. appeal from a judgment\r\nrendered in favor of David Bruce McFadden as Independent Executor of the Estate of Freida H.\r\nMcFadden.<sup> (1)</sup>  We affirm the judgment with regard to liability and damages.  We reverse that portion\r\nof the judgment awarding attorneys' fees and remand for a new trial on that issue.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>FACTUAL SUMMARY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn1982 or 1983, Freida McFadden purchased Ellyson Abstract and Title Company with\r\noffices located in Fort Stockton and Alpine, Texas.  For the majority of this time period, it was the\r\nonly title company in Fort Stockton.  Joy Adams worked for Freida in the Alpine office for two or\r\nthree years and Freida sold Joy the Alpine office in 1986 or 1987.  In 1999, Joy discussed purchasing\r\nthe Fort Stockton office for $300,000 but the transaction was not consummated.  Around November\r\n2000, Joy learned through a third party that Freida wanted to sell the Fort Stockton company for\r\n$150,000.  Joy called Freida and agreed to purchase Ellyson Abstract for that price.  Joy contacted\r\nan attorney Freida had recommended to draft the documents.  On December 22, 2000, Joy and Freida\r\nexecuted an Improved Property Commercial Contract conveying the real property to Joy and her\r\nhusband, E.P. \"Apache\" Adams, for the purchase price of $150,000.  On January 5, 2001, Freida\r\nexecuted a bill of sale conveying to Joy and Apache all of the personal property situated at the offices\r\nof Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Company in Fort Stockton, including but not limited to \"all furniture,\r\nfixtures, computers including all soft ware and any records contained in the hard drive, all files, all\r\ncard files of legal transactions, typewriters, calculators, adding machines, copiers, telephones, all\r\noffice supplies, and any and all other personal property situated at the location of Ellyson Abstract\r\nand Title Company.\"  At the time of sale, there were two title insurance commitments with pending\r\nclosings.  These commitments related to large tracts of land and were referred to as the \"Windfarm\r\nProjects.\"  One was referred to as the Chicago Abstract Project and the other as the Stewart Title\r\nProject.  Only the Stewart Title project eventually closed through Ellyson Abstract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcFadden alleged--and the jury found--that Freida and Joy had an oral agreement that Freida\r\nwould receive the proceeds from the two pending title commitments because they had been written\r\nbefore the sale.  In the year following Joy's purchase of the business, Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Co.,\r\nL.L.C., received $416,475.30 from the Stewart Title deal.  Joy did not notify Freida that the money\r\nhad been received and she threatened the employees at Ellyson Abstract with termination if any of\r\nthem informed Freida about it.  Freida's attorney wrote a letter to Joy demanding that she pay her\r\nthe proceeds received on the Windfarm Project, but Joy did not do so.  Freida died on July 19, 2003\r\nand her son, Bruce McFadden, in his capacity as executor of his mother's estate, filed suit against\r\nJoy Adams, E.P. Adams, and Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Company, L.L.C., asserting claims for breach\r\nof contract, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and common law fraud.  A jury found in\r\nMcFadden's favor on the breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion claims but\r\nfound in favor of Joy on the fraud claim.  The jury awarded actual damages in the amount of\r\n$169,036.32 and reasonable attorneys' fees in the amount of $205,000.  The jury also found that Joy\r\nintentionally breached her fiduciary duty, but it did not award exemplary damages.  The trial court\r\nentered judgment in favor of McFadden based on the jury's verdict.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ILLEGALITY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issue One, Appellants contend that an oral agreement requiring Joy to pay the proceeds\r\nfrom the premium issued on the title policy is illegal as a matter of law because at the time the\r\nproceeds were received Freida no longer had a license to conduct insurance business, and therefore,\r\nJoy could not legally pay her the premium.  For the same reason, Appellants also argue that the\r\ncontract is unenforceable as a matter of law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the conclusion of McFadden's case-in-chief, Appellants moved for an instructed verdict\r\non the ground that the oral contract, if it existed, was illegal.  In support of their motion, Appellants\r\nasked the trial court to take judicial notice of their motion for summary judgment and the attached\r\nrecords from the Texas Department of Insurance showing that the licenses of Ellyson Abstract were\r\ncancelled on June 14, 2001 and Freida's license was cancelled on June 22, 2001.<sup> (2)</sup>  The court inquired\r\nwhy it should take judicial notice and asked Appellants whether they wished to introduce the\r\nevidence before the jury.  Appellants insisted it was a question of law.  The trial court did not\r\naffirmatively take judicial notice but simply instructed counsel to proceed.  The court overruled the\r\nmotion for instructed verdict on the ground of illegality.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants did not request the submission of any questions to the jury on their affirmative\r\ndefense of illegality<sup> (3)</sup> or their defense of impossibility of performance.  Appellants raised the issue\r\nagain in their motion for new trial.  In the section of their motion challenging the legal and factual\r\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's finding that Joy breached the oral agreement,\r\nAppellants stated:  \"As a matter of law, Joy Adams could not share proceeds of a title insurance\r\npremium with Freida McFadden and could not therefore have breached any agreement which may\r\nhave existed.  As more fully stated in Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, any such\r\nagreement is rendered void because such a contract would violate the law and by the doctrine of\r\nimpossibility.\"  Appellants also filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Citing\r\nSections 2502.051<sup> (4)</sup> and 2502.053<sup> (5)</sup> of the Texas Insurance Code, they alleged that McFadden's causes\r\nof action were \"barred as a matter of law\" because any oral agreement for Joy to pay Freida proceeds\r\nfrom the title policies was void and unenforceable.  The trial court overruled both motions.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe validity of a contract is generally a question of law.  <em>Farah v. Mafrige &amp; Kormanik, P.C.</em>,\r\n927 S.W.2d 663, 678 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ).  An illegal contract is one in\r\nwhich the parties undertake what the law forbids.  <em>Franklin v. Jackson</em>, 847 S.W.2d 306, 309\r\n(Tex.App.--El Paso 1992, writ denied).  A contract to do a thing which cannot be performed without\r\na violation of the law is void.  <em>Id</em>.  Because the contract violates the law, it imposes no legal\r\nobligation on the parties.  <em>Miller v. Long-Bell Lumber Co.</em>, 148 Tex. 160, 222 S.W.2d 244, 246 (Tex.\r\n1949); <em>Franklin</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 309.   However, a contract which could have been performed in a\r\nlegal manner will not be declared void simply because it may have been performed in an illegal\r\nmanner.  <em>Franklin</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 309, <em>citing Lewis v. Davis</em>, 145 Tex. 468, 199 S.W.2d 146, 148-49\r\n(1947); <em>Wade v. Jones</em>, 526 S.W.2d 160, 162-63 (Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas 1975, no writ).  The law\r\npresumes that contracts are legal, and the burden to prove illegality is on the party asserting it, in this\r\ncase, Appellants.  <em>See Franklin</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 310.  Unless the face of the contract shows it is\r\nillegal, the party asserting illegality must present evidence demonstrating the illegality before a court\r\nmay declare the contract void.<em>  See Lewis</em>, 199 S.W.2d at 149; <em>Franklin</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 310.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe begin with the presumption that the contract is legal.  Appellants did not introduce any\r\nevidence establishing that the contract was illegal at the time it was made.  Nor do they allege that\r\nFreida did not hold the appropriate licenses at the time of the oral agreement that Joy would pay her\r\nthe proceeds received from the two Windfarm Projects.  Because the contract could have been\r\nperformed in a legal fashion at the time it was made, Appellants had the burden to introduce\r\nevidence proving illegality.  This they failed to do.  We overrule Issue One.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>UNENFORCEABILITY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their second issue, Appellants maintain that the oral agreement is unenforceable because\r\nthe written agreement is unambiguous and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties.  Appellants\r\ncontend that Joy acquired the right to the premiums earned from the windmill projects when she\r\npurchased the business because Freida conveyed the \"files\" to her as part of the transaction, which\r\nincluded the right to those premiums.  In their reply brief, Appellants have expanded upon this\r\nargument.  Pointing to an integration clause in the written contract, they allege that the oral\r\nagreement is unenforceable and the written agreement must be enforced as written and cannot be\r\nadded to or varied by parol evidence. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive contract law, not evidence.  <em>Hubacek v. Ennis\r\nState Bank</em>, 159 Tex. 166, 317 S.W.2d 30, 31 (1958); <em>DeClaire v. G &amp; B McIntosh Family Limited\r\nPartnership</em>, 260 S.W.3d 34, 45 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet. h.).  We review parol\r\nevidence questions <em>de novo</em>, as questions of law.  <em>DeClaire</em>, 260 S.W.3d at 45.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen the parties have concluded a valid, integrated agreement, the parol evidence rule\r\nprecludes enforcement of a prior or contemporaneous inconsistent agreement.  <em>Edascio, L.L.C. v.\r\nNextiraOne L.L.C.</em>, 264 S.W.3d 786, 796 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. filed); <em>ISG State\r\nOperations, Inc. v. National Heritage Insurance Company</em>, 234 S.W.3d 711, 719 (Tex.App.--Eastland 2007, pet. denied).  The execution of a written contract presumes that all prior negotiations\r\nand agreements relating to the transaction have been merged into the written contract.  <em>Edascio</em>, 264\r\nS.W.3d at 796;<em> ISG State Operations</em>, 234 S.W.3d at 719.  Consequently, the agreement will be\r\nenforced as written and cannot be added to, varied, or contradicted by parol evidence.  <em>Edascio</em>, 264\r\nS.W.3d at 796;<em> ISG State Operations</em>, 234 S.W.3d at 719.  The parol evidence rule is particularly\r\napplicable when the written contract contains a recital that it contains the entire agreement between\r\nthe parties or a similarly-worded merger provision.  <em>Edascio</em>, 264 S.W.3d at 796.  Evidence that\r\nviolates the rule is incompetent and without probative force, and cannot properly be given legal\r\neffect.  <em>Garner v. Fidelity Bank, N.A.</em>, 244 S.W.3d 855, 859 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2008, no pet.).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tParol evidence may be admissible to show collateral, contemporaneous agreements that are\r\nconsistent with the underlying agreement.  <em>Gary E. Patterson &amp; Associates, P.C. v. Holub</em>, 264\r\nS.W.3d 180, 197 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied); <em>DeClaire</em>, 260 S.W.3d at 45. \r\nBut this exception does not permit parol evidence that varies or contradicts either the express terms\r\nor the implied terms of the written agreement.  <em>Gary E. Patterson</em>, 264 S.W.3d at 197;  <em>DeClaire</em>,\r\n260 S.W.3d at 45.  A collateral agreement is one the parties might naturally make separately, i.e.,\r\none not ordinarily expected to be embodied in, or integrated with the written agreement and not so\r\nclearly connected with the principal transaction as to be part and parcel of it.  <em>Garner</em>, 244 S.W.3d\r\nat 859. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn agreement is integrated if the parties intended a writing to be a final and complete\r\nexpression of agreed terms.  <em>Morgan Buildings and Spas, Inc. v. Humane Society of Southeast Texas</em>,\r\n249 S.W.3d 480, 486 (Tex.App.--Beaumont 2008, no pet.).  The inclusion of a merger or integration\r\nclause does not conclusively establish that the written contract is fully integrated.  <em>Id.  </em>A fully\r\nintegrated written agreement is a final and complete expression of all the terms agreed upon by the\r\nparties.  <em>Id</em>.  A partially integrated agreement is a final and complete expression of all the terms\r\naddressed in that written agreement, but is not a final and complete expression of all the terms the\r\nparties have agreed upon. <em> Id</em>.  A court considers the surrounding circumstances in determining\r\nwhether, and to what degree, an agreement is integrated.  <em>Id. </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJoy and Freida did not have a written agreement whereby Freida sold Ellyson Abstract to Joy. \r\nInstead, Freida sold Joy the real property, including improvements, the abstract plant, and the\r\npersonal property located on the business premises.  Joy and Freida signed the improved property\r\ncommercial contract on December 22, 2000, whereby Freida agreed to convey the real property to\r\nJoy for $150,000.  Section 11 of the contract, entitled \"Special Provisions\" provided as follows: \r\n\"This sale shall include the real estate and all improvements located thereon; All equipment,\r\ncomputers, supplies, abstract plant, copiers, fax machines, Seller will net $150,000.00.\"  The\r\ncontract also included an integration clause in Section 22(C):  \"This contract contains the entire\r\nagreement of the parties and may not be changed except by written agreement.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDespite the real property contract's recitation that it contains the entire agreement of the\r\nparties, it did not set forth all the terms of the sale and transfer of personal property.  On January 5,\r\n2001, Freida executed a \"Bill of Sale\" which recited the sale of certain personal property to E.P.\r\nAdams and Joy B. Adams, effective January 30, 2001.  The Bill of Sale includes the following\r\ndescription of the property:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAll of the personal property situated at the offices of Ellyson Abstract and Title\r\nCompany at 117 South Main, Fort Stockton, Pecos County, Texas, 79735 . . .\r\nincluding but not limited to all furniture, fixtures, computers including all soft ware\r\nand any records contained in the hard drive, all files, all card files of legal\r\ntransactions, typewriters, calculators, adding machines, copiers, telephones, all office\r\nsupplies, and any and all other personal property situated at the location of Ellyson\r\nAbstract and Title Company.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The Bill of Sale sets forth the terms of the personal property transferred from Freida to Joy and it\r\nlisted items that were not included in the real property contract.  Appellants claim that the orders for\r\ntitle commitments were personal property and were included in the Bill of Sale as \"files.\"  A\r\n\"commitment for title insurance\" is defined by the Texas Insurance Code to mean a title insurance\r\nform under which a title insurance company offers to issue a title insurance policy subject to stated\r\nexceptions, requirements, and terms.  Tex.Ins.Code Ann. § 2701.001(a)(Vernon 2009).  A\r\ncommitment for title insurance constitutes a statement of the terms and conditions on which a title\r\ninsurance company is willing to issue its policy.  Tex.Ins.Code Ann. § 2701.001(b)(Vernon 2009). \r\nThe real property contract and the bill of sale are silent with respect to the right to the premiums\r\nfrom the Windfarm Projects, neither of which had closed at the time of the sale.  In support of their\r\nargument that \"files,\" as used in the Bill of Sale, meant orders for commitments, Appellants point\r\nto the testimony of Brenda Faubion, a former employee of Ellyson Abstract.  During Appellants'\r\ncross-examination, counsel asked Faubion what makes up a title plant, and she responded \"[t]he\r\nrecords, the equipment, the files.\"  She explained that an abstract plant is comprised of the records\r\nwhich show property title.  The following exchange then occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Appellants' counsel]:  What do you mean by 'files'?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Faubion]:  I mean the existing files that were left there.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Appellants' counsel]:  People that had asked for commitments.  Right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Faubion]:  Right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Appellants' counsel]:  Pending work.  Right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[McFadden's counsel]:  Object as to form.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Appellants' counsel]:  Pending work.  Right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Faubion]:  Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Faubion's testimony as to the meaning of the term \"files\" is incompetent parol evidence because\r\nAppellants, who have asserted throughout trial and appeal that the contracts are unambiguous,\r\noffered it to explain the meaning of the term \"files\" in the Bill of Sale.  <em>Swinnea v. ERI Consulting\r\nEngineers, Inc.</em>, 236 S.W.3d 825, 835 (Tex.App.--Tyler 2007, pet. filed)(parol evidence rule\r\nprohibits the admission of extrinsic evidence to vary or explain the terms or contradict the legal\r\neffect of an unambiguous written instrument in the absence of a showing of fraud, accident, or\r\nmistake in its preparation).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven if Faubion's testimony on the subject of the meaning of the term \"files\" is competent\r\nevidence, it does not address who had the right to the premiums.  There is no language in the real\r\nproperty contract or the bill of sale by which Freida unambiguously expressed an intent to transfer\r\nto Joy the right to the premiums from the Windfarm Projects as part of the sale.  Considering the\r\nsurrounding circumstances, we conclude that the real property contract is only partially integrated\r\nbecause it does not fully address the transfer of personal property and it does not address at all the\r\nright to the premiums from the pending title commitment orders.  McFadden's expert witness, Bert\r\nMassey, expressed an expert opinion that he would have expected the contract between the parties\r\nto address accounts receivable, accounts payable, and work in progress, but it did not.  He went on\r\nto explain that he would have expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to outstanding\r\nobligations of Ellyson Abstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which had not yet\r\nbeen received, and what value to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed.  Referring\r\nto the two outstanding orders for title commitments, Massey expected to see something in an\r\nagreement relating to what compensation, if any, the prior owner would receive for the work that was\r\ndone but not paid for up until the time the transaction closed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe parties' oral agreement that Joy would pay Freida the premiums when the Windfarm\r\nProjects closed does not contradict the written agreement.  Therefore, the evidence regarding the oral\r\ncontract is competent evidence and the oral contract does not violate the merger doctrine.  Issue Two\r\nis overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issue Three, Appellants challenge the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\r\nsupporting the jury's finding that Joy Adams entered into an oral agreement with Freida McFadden\r\nto pay her the proceeds resulting from title policies issued in connection with the Windfarm Projects. \r\n<center><em>Legal Sufficiency</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA \"no evidence\" or legal insufficiency point is a question of law which challenges the legal\r\nsufficiency of the evidence to support a particular fact finding.  <em>Serrano v. Union Planters Bank</em>,\r\nN.A., 162 S.W.3d 576, 579 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2004, pet. denied).  There are two separate \"no\r\nevidence\" claims.  <em>Id</em>.  When the party having the burden of proof suffers an unfavorable finding,\r\nthe point of error challenging the legal sufficiency of the evidence should be that the fact or issue was\r\nestablished as \"a matter of law.\"  <em>Id</em>.  When the party without the burden of proof suffers an\r\nunfavorable finding, the challenge on appeal is one of \"no evidence to support the finding.\"  <em>Id</em>.;<em> In\r\nre Estate of Livingston</em>, 999 S.W.2d 874, 879 (Tex.App.--El Paso 1999, no pet.).

Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex. 2005); <em>El Paso Independent\r\nSchool District v. Pabon</em>, 214 S.W.3d 37, 41 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.).  In conducting our\r\nreview, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every\r\nreasonable inference that would support it.  <em>City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 822.  Even if evidence is\r\nundisputed, it is the province of the trier of fact to draw from it whatever inferences it wishes so long\r\nas more than one inference is possible.  <em>Id</em>. at 821.

If the\r\nevidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions, then\r\nthe trier of fact must be allowed to do so.  <em>Id</em>. at 822.  So long as the evidence falls within this zone\r\nof reasonable disagreement, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the trier-of-fact.  <em>Id</em>.

Before his\r\nmother died, Bruce McFadden asked employees at Ellyson Abstract on several occasions whether\r\nthe Windfarm Projects had closed.  Each time, the employees said they had not.  While driving along\r\nI-10 in July 2002, Bruce saw that the windfarm had gone up.  Consequently, he called Joy and asked\r\nher if the Windfarm Projects had closed.  She said they had, and Bruce asked when his mother was\r\ngoing to get her money.  Joy replied, \"I've been beating myself about the head and shoulders trying\r\nto figure out a way to get her paid.\"  Joy revealed that she had been speaking to the Texas Insurance\r\nCommission and they would not allow Joy to pay her.  Bruce told Joy that it was his mother's\r\nretirement money and she was counting on it.  He then asked Joy whether she had used his mother's\r\nmoney to buy the new $65,000 Cadillac Escalade he had seen sitting in the parking lot.  Joy replied,\r\n\"Bruce, I haven't spent one dime of your mother's money on that car.\"  Bruce told Joy he would call\r\nher the next day and they hung up.  Bruce called her a couple of days later and Joy advised him that\r\nshe had an attorney and Bruce should call him.  Bruce also testified that after the sale of Ellyson\r\nAbstract, his mother had retained an Ellyson Abstract escrow account to receive the premiums from\r\nthe Windfarm Projects.  According to him, there would have been no other reason for her to keep\r\nan escrow account.  His mother kept the account open until the day she died.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJack McIntyre, an independent businessman, spoke with Freida in July or August of 2000\r\nabout purchasing Ellyson Abstract.  Freida said the sale would include the building and the business\r\nbut she clearly indicated to him that she would retain two \"windmill contracts.\"  She did not\r\nspecifically tell McIntyre what the contracts were worth but he understood that it was a substantial\r\namount of money.  McIntyre did not purchase the business because he could not afford it at the time. \r\n\tBrenda Faubion worked for both Freida and Joy at Ellyson Abstract.  On March 30, 2001,\r\nEllyson Abstract remitted two cashier's checks to \"Freida McFadden dba Ellyson Abstract,\" one in\r\nthe amount of $4,405.87 and the other in the amount of $6,567.83.  On August 8, 2001, Rosie\r\nCausey, an Ellyson Abstract employee, sent a check to Freida in the amount of $5,631 with the\r\nnotation \"Woodward Mtn TWP-06-03.\"  Causey attached a note which stated, \"Freida, I know this\r\nisn't exactly what you were expecting, but we've had to separate the charges for Cielo and Chicago\r\nTitle.  Cielo is paying for their charges but we have not received anything from Chicago.\"  Freida\r\ncalled Ellyson Abstract and spoke with Faubion about these checks.  Faubion told Freida that Joy\r\nhad instructed them to send the checks to her.  Freida asked her whether the main part of the\r\ntransaction had closed and Faubion told her it had not.  Freida said that she was not going to cash\r\nthe checks because she believed the deal was going to close and she did not want it to appear that\r\nshe was agreeing to take the lesser amount of money.  Freida indicated to Faubion she expected to\r\nreceive the money when the deal closed because they had done 90 percent of the work.\r\nApproximately six months after the sale of Ellyson Abstract, Faubion spoke with Bruce McFadden. \r\nHe asked her whether the Windfarm Projects had closed.  She told him they had not.  Two weeks\r\nlater, Bruce went to the office and spoke with Faubion about uncashed checks he had found. \r\nAccording to Faubion, some of the checks were for title policy premiums that had been collected\r\nafter Joy had purchased Ellyson Abstract.  Faubion assumed that those checks had not been cashed\r\nbecause they had been misplaced.  Three or four other checks were from Cielo Land on the Chicago\r\nTitle transaction.  Faubion knew from her prior conversation with Freida that she purposely had not\r\ncashed those checks.  Faubion recalled that after Ellyson Abstract received the money for the Stewart\r\nTitle policy, Joy told her that she did not know whether she would be able to give Freida any of the\r\nmoney.  Joy explained that she had contacted Stewart Title in San Antonio and they questioned\r\nwhether it was legal for Joy to disburse any of it to Freida.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMelody Tijerina, a former employee of Ellyson Abstract, testified that Joy warned the\r\nemployees if <em>any</em> of them told Freida that the money from the Windfarm Projects had come in, she\r\nwould fire <em>all</em> of them.  It was because of this threat that Tijerina never told Freida that the money\r\nhad been received.  Tijerina knew Joy's threat was related to a condition of the sale of Ellyson\r\nAbstract to Joy.  Tijerina quit working for Ellyson Abstract in 2001 because of Joy's conduct and\r\nshe moved to Idaho.  Tijerina regretted never telling Freida that the money from the Windfarm\r\nProjects had been received in July of 2001, but she told Bruce in January of 2006 what she knew. \r\n\tFinally, McFadden offered expert testimony to prove the existence of an oral agreement. \r\nBert Massey is a Texas attorney who practices real estate law and has owned a title insurance agency\r\nsince 1980.  Massey is also a licensed escrow officer and is an approved examining attorney of real\r\nestate titles for five title insurance underwriting companies who do business in Texas.  Massey has\r\nqualified as an expert on title insurance in proceedings before the  State Insurance Board and State\r\nInsurance Commission.  In preparation for his testimony, Massey reviewed a large amount of\r\ndocuments, including the order sheets on two potential title insurance transactions and the documents\r\nrelated to the sale of Ellyson Abstract to Joy.  He also reviewed McFadden's trial exhibit notebooks. \r\nIn Massey's opinion, there was an oral agreement between the parties.  He based his opinion on the\r\nissuance of checks from Ellyson Abstract  to Freida, the former owner.  He stated there had to\r\nbe an agreement relating to some matters that were going to happen after the closing because there\r\nwould have been no need for the payments to be made after the business was sold.  In connection\r\nwith his review of the documents pertaining to the sale of Ellyson Abstract to Joy, Massey testified\r\nthat the written contracts did not address accounts receivable, accounts payable, and work in\r\nprogress.  He explained that he would have expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to\r\noutstanding obligations of Ellyson Abstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which\r\nhad not yet been received, and what value to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed. \r\nReferring to the two outstanding orders for title commitments related to the Windfarm Projects,\r\nMassey expected to see something in an agreement relating to what compensation, if any, the prior\r\nowner would receive for the work that was done but not paid for up until the time the transaction\r\nclosed.  The written agreements did not address any of these matters.  Massey concluded that the\r\nparties must have had an oral agreement because Ellyson Abstract paid monies to Freida after the\r\nsale.  In his thirty-six years in the title insurance business, Massey had never worked on any title\r\ncommitments as valuable as the Windfarm Projects.  In his opinion, there was no question that most\r\nrural title insurance companies would consider these to be the deals of a lifetime.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to expert testimony, there was other evidence relevant to the existence of an oral\r\ncontract.  Freida offered to sell the business to Jack McIntyre but made clear to him that the sale\r\nwould not include the Windfarm Projects.  Joy purchased the business for one-half of the price she\r\nhad been quoted two years earlier.  After purchasing Ellyson Abstract, Joy threatened to fire her\r\nemployees if any of them told Freida that Ellyson Abstract had received the money from the\r\nWindfarm Projects.  Melody Tijerina knew that Joy's threat was related to a condition of the sale of\r\nEllyson Abstract.  Joy had Ellyson Abstract employees forward checks to Freida several months after\r\nthe sale.  After Ellyson Abstract received the proceeds from the Stewart Title deal, Joy told Brenda\r\nFaubion that she did not know whether she would be able to give the money to Freida.  This is\r\ncontrary to her position at trial that Freida did not retain any right to the premiums when she sold the\r\nbusiness.  Similarly, when Bruce McFadden called Joy in July 2001 about the closing of the\r\nWindfarm Projects and his mother's money, Joy did not indicate any surprise or disagreement that\r\nFreida expected to receive money in connection with the closing of the Windfarm Projects but\r\ninstead said she was trying to figure out a way for his mother to get \"her money.\"  When Bruce asked\r\nJoy whether she had purchased a new vehicle with his mother's money, Joy again referred to the\r\nmoney as Freida's money and insisted she had not spent one penny of \"your mother's money.\" \r\nWhen viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the foregoing evidence supports a conclusion\r\nthat Freida retained the right to the premiums from the Windfarm Projects when she sold the\r\nbusiness to Joy, and Joy and Freida had an oral agreement that Freida would receive the premiums\r\nwhen Windfarm Projects closed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><em>Factual Sufficiency</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a challenge to the factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting a vital fact, we\r\nmust consider, weigh, and examine all of the evidence in the record, both supporting and against the\r\nfinding, to decide whether the verdict should be set aside.  <em>Plas-Tex, Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp.</em>, 772\r\nS.W.2d 442, 445 (Tex. 1989).  When a party attacks the factual sufficiency of an adverse finding on\r\nan issue on which the opposing party has the burden of proof, we should set aside the verdict only\r\nif the evidence supporting the jury finding is so weak as to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust. \r\n<em>See Cain v. Bain</em>, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).  We are not permitted to substitute our\r\njudgment for that of the jury.  <em>Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson</em>, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761-62 (Tex.\r\n2003).  Further, we bear in mind that the jury is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and the\r\nweight to be given to their testimony.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs noted in our discussion of the legal sufficiency challenge, Joy denied the existence of an\r\noral agreement.  Appellants challenged the credibility of the witnesses who testified in support of\r\na finding that an oral agreement existed.  Joy explained that the two checks sent to Freida in March \r\n2001 were funds Freida left in Ellyson Abstract's escrow account.  She said Freida was entitled to\r\nthe check issued by Cielo Land in connection with the Chicago Title deal because it was a\r\nreimbursement for her expenses.  It was the jury's task to determine credibility and resolve conflicts\r\nin the evidence.  The record does not demonstrate that the evidence supporting the jury's finding is\r\nso weak as to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust.  We overrule Issue Three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONVERSION AND BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issues Four and Five, Appellants raise sufficiency challenges to the jury's findings on the\r\nconversion and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action.  It is unnecessary to address these issues\r\nbecause the jury's finding on the breach of contract cause of action will support the judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CHARGE ERROR</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issue Six, Appellants assert that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the various\r\nelements of damages recoverable in connection with the breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty\r\nand conversion causes of action.<sup> (6)</sup>  Question 7 in the court's charge asked the following:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhat sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly and reasonably\r\ncompensate <em>The Estate of Freida McFadden</em> for its damages, if any, for the conduct\r\ndescribed in Questions 2, 4, 5, or 6?  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The instructions accompanying this question did not include any instructions on the proper measure\r\nof damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDamages must be measured by a legal standard and that standard must be used to guide the\r\nfact finder in determining what sum would compensate the injured party.  <em>Jackson v. Fontaine's\r\nClinics, Inc.</em>, 499 S.W.2d 87, 90 (Tex. 1973).  A jury question which fails to guide the jury on any\r\nproper legal measure of damages is fatally defective.  <em>Id.</em>  To preserve error, the complaining party\r\nmust object to the charge and tender the instructions in substantially correct form.  Tex.R.Civ.P.\r\n278;<sup> (7)</sup> <em>Jim Howe Homes, Inc. v. Rogers</em>, 818 S.W.2d 901, 903 (Tex.App.--Austin 1991, no writ). \r\nWhile Appellants objected at the charge conference that Question 7 did not include instructions on\r\nthe measure of damages for the various legal theories, they did not submit in writing a request for\r\nan instruction.  Consequently, this issue is waived.  We overrule Issue Six.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>SEGREGATION OF ATTORNEYS' FEES</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issue Seven, Appellants argue that McFadden failed to segregate attorneys' fees.  A party\r\nseeking attorneys' fees must show that the fees were incurred on a claim that allows recovery of such\r\nfees, and thus is ordinarily required to segregate fees incurred on claims allowing recovery of fees\r\nfrom those that do not.  <em>Stewart Title Guaranty Company v.  Aiello</em>, 941 S.W.2d 68, 73 (Tex.  1997). \r\nThere is an exception to this rule.<sup> (8)</sup>  When discrete legal services advance both recoverable claims\r\nand unrecoverable claims, attorneys are not required to segregate fees to recover the total amount\r\ncovering all claims.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 299, 313 (Tex. 2006);\r\n<em>CA Partners v. Spears</em>, 274 S.W.3d 51, 81 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied).  In\r\n<em>Tony Gullo Motors</em>, the Supreme Court eliminated the exception to the segregation requirement for\r\nfees incurred solely on a separate but intertwined claim.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14. \r\nIf any attorneys' fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, the claimant\r\nmust segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.  <em>Id.</em> at 313.  This standard does not require\r\nattorneys to keep separate time records when they draft the breach of contract and fraud paragraphs\r\nof a petition.  <em>See id.</em> at 314.  The amount of recoverable attorneys' fees is sufficiently segregated if,\r\nfor example, the attorney testifies that a given percentage of the drafting time would have been\r\nnecessary even if the claim for which attorneys' fees are recoverable had not been asserted.  <em>Id. </em> at\r\n314; <em>see CA Partners</em>, 274 S.W.3d at 82; <em>7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v. Dollar Rent A Car Systems,\r\nInc.</em>, 245 S.W.3d 488, 509 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).  The need to\r\nsegregate attorneys' fees is a question of law, while the extent to which claims can or cannot be\r\nsegregated is a mixed question of law and fact.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 312-13; <em>CA\r\nPartners</em>, 274 S.W.3d at 82.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcFadden asserts that Appellants waived the error by failing to object to counsel's testimony\r\non attorney's fees.  Appellants preserved their complaint by objecting to the charge.<em>  See Hong Kong\r\nDevelopment, Inc. v. Nguyen</em>, 229 S.W.3d 415, 454 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no\r\npet.)(objection to charge preserved error related to unsegregated attorney's fees); <em>Young v.\r\nNeatherlin</em>, 102 S.W.3d 415, 420 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.)(holding that\r\nobjection to charge preserved challenge, even though party had not objected to testimony on\r\nunsegregated fees); <em>see also McCalla v. Ski River Dev., Inc.</em>, 239 S.W.3d 374, 383 (Tex.App.--Waco\r\n2007, no pet.)(to preserve complaint that the opposing party failed to segregate its attorney's fees,\r\n\"[g]enerally, such an issue is preserved by objection during testimony offered in support of attorney's\r\nfees or an objection to the jury question on attorney's fees\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe turn now to the issue of whether McFadden was required to segregate.  McFadden argues\r\nthat Appellants failed to ask any questions during cross-examination regarding the need to segregate. \r\nAppellants were not required to cross-examine on the issue because it was McFadden's burden to\r\nprove that fee segregation is not required.  <em>See CA Partners</em>, 274 S.W.3d at 82.  It cannot be disputed\r\nthat a portion of counsel's time was spent drafting the pleadings related to the tort claims.  While\r\nMcFadden might argue that this time is nominal, unrecoverable fees are not rendered recoverable\r\nmerely because they are nominal.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 313; <em>CA Partners</em>, 274\r\nS.W.3d at 84.  Consequently, we find that McFadden was required to segregate.  <em>See CA Partners</em>,\r\n274 S.W.3d at 84.  We sustain Issue Seven.  McFadden did not forfeit his right to recover attorney's\r\nfees by failing to segregate them because the evidence he presented regarding the total amount\r\nconstitutes some evidence of what the segregated amount should be.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212\r\nS.W.3d at 314; <em>CA Partners</em>, 274 S.W.3d at 84.  Therefore, a remand for a new trial on recoverable\r\nattorney's fees is the appropriate remedy.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ADMISSION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issue Eight, Appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the\r\nexpert testimony of Bert Massey.  There are two parts to this issue.  First, Appellants assert that\r\nMassey's opinion on this subject was not disclosed during discovery.  Second, Appellants argue that\r\nMassey's opinion on this subject is unreliable.  We will address the latter issue first.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhether to admit or exclude evidence is within the trial court's sound discretion.  <em>National\r\nLiability and Fire Insurance Company v. Allen</em>, 15 S.W.3d 525, 527 (Tex. 2000).  Accordingly, we\r\nreview the admission of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.  <em>Helena Chemical Company v.\r\nWilkins</em>, 47 S.W.3d 486, 499 (Tex. 2001).  The trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is\r\narbitrary, unreasonable, or without reference to any guiding rules or legal principles.<em>  K-Mart Corp.\r\nv.

For an expert's testimony to be admissible, the expert must be qualified and the\r\nexpert's opinion must be relevant to the issues in the case and based upon a reliable foundation. \r\n<em>Exxon Pipeline Company v. Zwahr</em>, 88 S.W.3d 623, 628 (Tex. 2002); <em>Helena Chemical Company\r\nv. Wilkins</em>, 47 S.W.3d 486, 499 (Tex. 2001).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants have not challenged Massey's qualifications as an expert or the relevance of his\r\ntestimony.  They assail only one aspect of his testimony, namely, his conclusion that an oral\r\nagreement existed, and they contend that his conclusion is unreliable.  Unreliable evidence is of no\r\nassistance to the trier of fact and is therefore inadmissible under Rule 702.  <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours\r\n&amp; Co. v. Robinson</em>, 923 S.W.2d 549, 557 (Tex. 1995); <em>Greenberg Traurig of New York, P.C. v.\r\nMoody</em>, 161 S.W.3d 56, 93 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.).  The reliability\r\nrequirement focuses on the principles, research, and methodology underlying an expert's\r\nconclusions.  <em>Zwahr</em>, 88 S.W.3d at 629.  But because it is impossible to set the criteria for evaluating\r\nthe reliability of expert testimony in non-scientific cases such as this, it is within the trial court's\r\ndiscretion to determine how to assess reliability.  <em>Greenberg Traurig of New York, P.C. v. Moody</em>,\r\n161 S.W.3d at 93.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants assert that Massey's opinion is unreliable because it is based on the existence of\r\npayments to Freida after the sale and there were other explanations for those payments, including\r\nthat some of the payments were from Freida's own escrow account.  Those were not the only\r\npayments made to Freida and the existence of the payments was not the only basis for Massey's\r\nopinion.  By virtue of his experience, Massey was familiar with the operations of a title company and\r\nwith what is involved when such a business is sold.  Massey found it unusual that the written\r\ndocuments did not address accounts receivable, accounts payable, and work in progress.  He would\r\nhave expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to outstanding obligations of Ellyson\r\nAbstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which had not yet been received, and what\r\nvalue to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed.  Under these circumstances,\r\nMassey concluded that there must have been an oral agreement.  We find no abuse its discretion in\r\nthe trial court's determination that Massey's testimony was reliable.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><em>Failure to Supplement Discovery Response</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants also complain that Massey's opinion on the existence of an oral agreement should\r\nhave been excluded because McFadden did not disclose it.  A party must disclose a testifying\r\nexpert's mental impressions and opinions and any methods used to derive them.  Tex.R.Civ.P.\r\n192.3(e)(4).  A party may request disclosure of the general substance of the testifying expert's mental\r\nimpressions and opinions and a brief summary of the basis for them.  Tex.R.Civ.P. 194.2(f)(3).  The\r\nRules of Civil Procedure impose on a party an ongoing duty to supplement or amend its discovery\r\nresponses.  <em>See</em> Tex.R. Civ. P. 193.5.  Under Rule 193.6(a):</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party who fails to make, amend, or supplement a discovery response in a timely\r\nmanner may not introduce in evidence the material or information that was not timely\r\ndisclosed, or offer the testimony of a witness (other than a named party) who was not\r\ntimely identified, unless the court finds that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(1) there was good cause for the failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the\r\ndiscovery response; or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(2) the failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the discovery response will not\r\nunfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice the other parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex.R.Civ.P. 193.6(a).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcFadden disclosed in a supplemental discovery response that Massey would testify \"to the\r\nfactors, customs and practices generally involved in developing, assessing and conveying the assets\r\nof an abstract plant, as well as his opinions as to the reasonable considerations and practical\r\nimplementation of transfer of files and accounting for premiums when an abstract plant is being\r\nconveyed, especially as these factors apply to the facts of this case.\"  This broad designation certainly\r\ncovered Massey's testimony regarding what he expected to see in an agreement conveying an\r\nabstract plant.  Massey expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to outstanding\r\nobligations of Ellyson Abstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which had not yet\r\nbeen received, and what value to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed.  Although\r\nit was not specifically stated, Massey's conclusion that the parties had an oral agreement about these\r\nmatters falls within the disclosure.  The trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling\r\nAppellants' objection and admitting the testimony.  Issue Eight is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>LIABILITY OF ELLYSON ABSTRACT</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their final issue, Appellants complain that the trial court erred by entering judgment against\r\nEllyson Abstract &amp; Title Company, L.L.C. because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence\r\nshowing that it was liable to McFadden.  Appellants contend that the pleadings and evidence do not\r\nsupport piercing the corporate veil.  They additionally assert that Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Company,\r\nL.L.C. is a limited liability <em>company</em>, not a limited liability<em> corporation.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the original petition, McFadden named as defendants Joy B. and E. P. Adams<sup> (9)</sup> d/b/a\r\nEllyson Abstract &amp; Title Co.  Appellants indicated in a discovery response that \"Ellyson Abstract\r\n&amp; Title L.L.C.\" is a potential party to the suit.  McFadden amended the petition to include Ellyson\r\nAbstract &amp; Title Co., L.L.C. as a defendant.  The petition alleged that Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Co.,\r\nL.L.C. is a limited liability corporation licensed to do business in Texas.  Contrary to Appellants'\r\ncontention on appeal that Ellyson Abstract is a limited liability <em>company</em>, Joy testified that Ellyson\r\nAbstract &amp; Title Co., L.L.C. is a limited liability <em>corporation </em>and she is the president and sole\r\nstockholder.  She formed the L.L.C. in 1999 prior to purchasing Ellyson Abstract from Freida. \r\nAccording to Joy, the L.L.C. owns the abstract plant and the equipment while she and her husband\r\npersonally own the building.  The evidence at trial showed that the L.L.C. received the premiums\r\nfrom the Stewart Title project.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA person's status as a vice-principal of the corporation is sufficient to impute liability to the\r\ncorporation.  <em>GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce</em>, 998 S.W.2d 605, 618 (Tex. 1999); <em>DaimlerChrysler Ins.\r\nCo. v. Apple</em>, 265 S.W.3d 52, 64 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. filed).  Corporations can\r\nact only through their agents.  <em>GTE Southwest</em>, 998 S.W.2d at 618.  A vice-principal represents the\r\ncorporation in its corporate capacity.  <em>Id</em>.  When actions are taken by a vice-principal of a\r\ncorporation, those acts may be deemed to be the acts of the corporation itself.  <em>Id.</em>  A vice-principal\r\nencompasses four classes of corporate agents: (a) corporate officers; (b) those who have authority\r\nto employ, direct, and discharge servants of the master; (c) those engaged in the performance of\r\nnondelegable or absolute duties of the master; and (d) those to whom a master has confided the\r\nmanagement of the whole or a department or division of his business.  <em> Hammerly Oaks, Inc. v.\r\nEdwards</em>, 958 S.W.2d 387, 391 (Tex. 1997).  Courts use the vice-principal doctrine to distinguish\r\nbetween the acts of the corporation itself and that of a mere servant or employee.  <em>Id.</em>  Acts of a\r\n\"mere servant or employee\" are the basis for corporate liability based on the doctrine of <em>respondeat\r\nsuperior</em>.  <em>Id.</em>  The liability of the master for the negligent acts of his vice principal is placed upon\r\nvery different grounds, namely, that the negligent acts of the vice principal are the very acts of the\r\ncorporation itself.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe undisputed evidence established that Joy is a vice-principal of Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title\r\nCo., L.L.C , and the monies which McFadden sought to recover were received by the L.L.C. and\r\nwere not paid to Freida.  Consequently, Joy's acts are the acts of the corporation.  The jury's findings\r\nare sufficient to impute liability to the L.L.C.  We overrule Issue Nine.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaving sustained Issue Seven, we reverse that portion of the judgment awarding attorneys'\r\nfees.  Finding no other error, we affirm the remainder of the judgment.

The record before us does not reflect whether the trial court ruled on the motion for summary judgment.  \r\n</p><p>3.   Illegality is an affirmative defense.  Tex.R.Civ.P. 94.  \r\n</p><p>4.   Section 2502.051 of the Texas Insurance Code provides that \"[a] commission, rebate, discount, portion of\r\na title insurance premium, or other thing of value may not be directly or indirectly paid, allowed, or permitted by a person\r\nengaged in the business of title insurance or received or accepted by a person for engaging in the business of title\r\ninsurance or for soliciting or referring title insurance business.\"  Tex.Ins.Code Ann. § 2502.051 (Vernon 2009).\r\n</p><p>5.   Section 2502.051 does not prohibit:  (1) payment for services actually performed by a title insurance\r\ncompany, title insurance agent, or direct operation in connection with title examination or with closing the transaction\r\nor furnishing title evidence if:  (A) the payment does not exceed the percentage of premium or other amount established\r\nby the commissioner for the payment; and (B) the person receiving the payment is licensed as provided by this title. \r\nTex.Ins.Code Ann. § 2502.053(1)(Vernon 2009).\r\n</p><p>6.   In their reply brief, Appellants contend the trial court failed to submit separate damages questions for each\r\ncause of action.  Citing <em>Harris County v.  Smith</em>, 96 S.W.3d 230 (Tex.  2002), Appellants argue that the error is harmful\r\nbecause the single broad-form damages question included both valid and invalid measures of damages. Appellants did\r\nnot raise these arguments in their initial brief but instead restricted their complaint to the absence of an instruction on\r\nthe proper measure of damages.  The Rules of Appellate Procedure do not allow an appellant to include in a reply brief\r\na new issue not raised by its original brief.  Tex.R.App.P. 38.3.  Accordingly, we will not address the arguments raised\r\nfor the first time in the reply brief.  <em>See Few v.

Rule 278 provides:  \"Failure to submit a definition or instruction shall not be deemed a ground for reversal\r\nof the judgment unless a substantially correct definition or instruction has been requested in writing and tendered by the\r\nparty complaining of the judgment.\"\r\n</p><p>8.   Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Tony Gullo Motors</em>, the exception applied when two or more claims\r\nwere dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances and thus were intertwined to the point of being inseparable. \r\n<em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 311 (discussing exception created by <em>Stewart Title Guaranty Company v. \r\nSterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11-12 (Tex.  1991).  Courts referred to the claims as being \"inextricably intertwined\" and fee\r\nsegregation was not required.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 311.  Noting that the exception threatened to\r\nswallow the rule, the Supreme Court eliminated this formulation of the exception.  <em>Id</em>., 212 S.W.3d at 312-13.\r\n</p><p>9.   The claims against E.

We reverse that portion\r\nof the judgment awarding attorneys' fees and remand for a new trial on that issue.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>FACTUAL SUMMARY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn1982 or 1983, Freida McFadden purchased Ellyson Abstract and Title Company with\r\noffices located in Fort Stockton and Alpine, Texas.  For the majority of this time period, it was the\r\nonly title company in Fort Stockton.  Joy Adams worked for Freida in the Alpine office for two or\r\nthree years and Freida sold Joy the Alpine office in 1986 or 1987.  In 1999, Joy discussed purchasing\r\nthe Fort Stockton office for $300,000 but the transaction was not consummated.  Around November\r\n2000, Joy learned through a third party that Freida wanted to sell the Fort Stockton company for\r\n$150,000.  Joy called Freida and agreed to purchase Ellyson Abstract for that price.  Joy contacted\r\nan attorney Freida had recommended to draft the documents.  On December 22, 2000, Joy and Freida\r\nexecuted an Improved Property Commercial Contract conveying the real property to Joy and her\r\nhusband, E.P. \"Apache\" Adams, for the purchase price of $150,000.  On January 5, 2001, Freida\r\nexecuted a bill of sale conveying to Joy and Apache all of the personal property situated at the offices\r\nof Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Company in Fort Stockton, including but not limited to \"all furniture,\r\nfixtures, computers including all soft ware and any records contained in the hard drive, all files, all\r\ncard files of legal transactions, typewriters, calculators, adding machines, copiers, telephones, all\r\noffice supplies, and any and all other personal property situated at the location of Ellyson Abstract\r\nand Title Company.\"  At the time of sale, there were two title insurance commitments with pending\r\nclosings.  These commitments related to large tracts of land and were referred to as the \"Windfarm\r\nProjects.\"  One was referred to as the Chicago Abstract Project and the other as the Stewart Title\r\nProject.  Only the Stewart Title project eventually closed through Ellyson Abstract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMcFadden alleged--and the jury found--that Freida and Joy had an oral agreement that Freida\r\nwould receive the proceeds from the two pending title commitments because they had been written\r\nbefore the sale.  In the year following Joy's purchase of the business, Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Co.,\r\nL.L.C., received $416,475.30 from the Stewart Title deal.  Joy did not notify Freida that the money\r\nhad been received and she threatened the employees at Ellyson Abstract with termination if any of\r\nthem informed Freida about it.  Freida's attorney wrote a letter to Joy demanding that she pay her\r\nthe proceeds received on the Windfarm Project, but Joy did not do so.  Freida died on July 19, 2003\r\nand her son, Bruce McFadden, in his capacity as executor of his mother's estate, filed suit against\r\nJoy Adams, E.P. Adams, and Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Company, L.L.C., asserting claims for breach\r\nof contract, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and common law fraud.  A jury found in\r\nMcFadden's favor on the breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion claims but\r\nfound in favor of Joy on the fraud claim.  The jury awarded actual damages in the amount of\r\n$169,036.32 and reasonable attorneys' fees in the amount of $205,000.  The jury also found that Joy\r\nintentionally breached her fiduciary duty, but it did not award exemplary damages.  The trial court\r\nentered judgment in favor of McFadden based on the jury's verdict.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ILLEGALITY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issue One, Appellants contend that an oral agreement requiring Joy to pay the proceeds\r\nfrom the premium issued on the title policy is illegal as a matter of law because at the time the\r\nproceeds were received Freida no longer had a license to conduct insurance business, and therefore,\r\nJoy could not legally pay her the premium.  For the same reason, Appellants also argue that the\r\ncontract is unenforceable as a matter of law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the conclusion of McFadden's case-in-chief, Appellants moved for an instructed verdict\r\non the ground that the oral contract, if it existed, was illegal.  In support of their motion, Appellants\r\nasked the trial court to take judicial notice of their motion for summary judgment and the attached\r\nrecords from the Texas Department of Insurance showing that the licenses of Ellyson Abstract were\r\ncancelled on June 14, 2001 and Freida's license was cancelled on June 22, 2001.<sup> (2)</sup>  The court inquired\r\nwhy it should take judicial notice and asked Appellants whether they wished to introduce the\r\nevidence before the jury.  Appellants insisted it was a question of law.  The trial court did not\r\naffirmatively take judicial notice but simply instructed counsel to proceed.  The court overruled the\r\nmotion for instructed verdict on the ground of illegality.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants did not request the submission of any questions to the jury on their affirmative\r\ndefense of illegality<sup> (3)</sup> or their defense of impossibility of performance.  Appellants raised the issue\r\nagain in their motion for new trial.  In the section of their motion challenging the legal and factual\r\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's finding that Joy breached the oral agreement,\r\nAppellants stated:  \"As a matter of law, Joy Adams could not share proceeds of a title insurance\r\npremium with Freida McFadden and could not therefore have breached any agreement which may\r\nhave existed.  As more fully stated in Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, any such\r\nagreement is rendered void because such a contract would violate the law and by the doctrine of\r\nimpossibility.\"  Appellants also filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Citing\r\nSections 2502.051<sup> (4)</sup> and 2502.053<sup> (5)</sup> of the Texas Insurance Code, they alleged that McFadden's causes\r\nof action were \"barred as a matter of law\" because any oral agreement for Joy to pay Freida proceeds\r\nfrom the title policies was void and unenforceable.  The trial court overruled both motions.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe validity of a contract is generally a question of law.  <em>Farah v.

However, a contract which could have been performed in a\r\nlegal manner will not be declared void simply because it may have been performed in an illegal\r\nmanner.  <em>Franklin</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 309, <em>citing Lewis v.

The law\r\npresumes that contracts are legal, and the burden to prove illegality is on the party asserting it, in this\r\ncase, Appellants.  <em>See Franklin</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 310.  Unless the face of the contract shows it is\r\nillegal, the party asserting illegality must present evidence demonstrating the illegality before a court\r\nmay declare the contract void.<em>  See Lewis</em>, 199 S.W.2d at 149; <em>Franklin</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 310.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe begin with the presumption that the contract is legal.  Appellants did not introduce any\r\nevidence establishing that the contract was illegal at the time it was made.  Nor do they allege that\r\nFreida did not hold the appropriate licenses at the time of the oral agreement that Joy would pay her\r\nthe proceeds received from the two Windfarm Projects.  Because the contract could have been\r\nperformed in a legal fashion at the time it was made, Appellants had the burden to introduce\r\nevidence proving illegality.  This they failed to do.  We overrule Issue One.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>UNENFORCEABILITY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their second issue, Appellants maintain that the oral agreement is unenforceable because\r\nthe written agreement is unambiguous and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties.  Appellants\r\ncontend that Joy acquired the right to the premiums earned from the windmill projects when she\r\npurchased the business because Freida conveyed the \"files\" to her as part of the transaction, which\r\nincluded the right to those premiums.  In their reply brief, Appellants have expanded upon this\r\nargument.  Pointing to an integration clause in the written contract, they allege that the oral\r\nagreement is unenforceable and the written agreement must be enforced as written and cannot be\r\nadded to or varied by parol evidence. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive contract law, not evidence.  <em>Hubacek v.

Joy and Freida signed the improved property\r\ncommercial contract on December 22, 2000, whereby Freida agreed to convey the real property to\r\nJoy for $150,000.  Section 11 of the contract, entitled \"Special Provisions\" provided as follows: \r\n\"This sale shall include the real estate and all improvements located thereon; All equipment,\r\ncomputers, supplies, abstract plant, copiers, fax machines, Seller will net $150,000.00.\"  The\r\ncontract also included an integration clause in Section 22(C):  \"This contract contains the entire\r\nagreement of the parties and may not be changed except by written agreement.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDespite the real property contract's recitation that it contains the entire agreement of the\r\nparties, it did not set forth all the terms of the sale and transfer of personal property.  On January 5,\r\n2001, Freida executed a \"Bill of Sale\" which recited the sale of certain personal property to E.P.\r\nAdams and Joy B. Adams, effective January 30, 2001.  The Bill of Sale includes the following\r\ndescription of the property:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAll of the personal property situated at the offices of Ellyson Abstract and Title\r\nCompany at 117 South Main, Fort Stockton, Pecos County, Texas, 79735 . . .\r\nincluding but not limited to all furniture, fixtures, computers including all soft ware\r\nand any records contained in the hard drive, all files, all card files of legal\r\ntransactions, typewriters, calculators, adding machines, copiers, telephones, all office\r\nsupplies, and any and all other personal property situated at the location of Ellyson\r\nAbstract and Title Company.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The Bill of Sale sets forth the terms of the personal property transferred from Freida to Joy and it\r\nlisted items that were not included in the real property contract.  Appellants claim that the orders for\r\ntitle commitments were personal property and were included in the Bill of Sale as \"files.\"  A\r\n\"commitment for title insurance\" is defined by the Texas Insurance Code to mean a title insurance\r\nform under which a title insurance company offers to issue a title insurance policy subject to stated\r\nexceptions, requirements, and terms.  Tex.Ins.Code Ann. § 2701.001(a)(Vernon 2009).  A\r\ncommitment for title insurance constitutes a statement of the terms and conditions on which a title\r\ninsurance company is willing to issue its policy.  Tex.Ins.Code Ann. § 2701.001(b)(Vernon 2009). \r\nThe real property contract and the bill of sale are silent with respect to the right to the premiums\r\nfrom the Windfarm Projects, neither of which had closed at the time of the sale.  In support of their\r\nargument that \"files,\" as used in the Bill of Sale, meant orders for commitments, Appellants point\r\nto the testimony of Brenda Faubion, a former employee of Ellyson Abstract.  During Appellants'\r\ncross-examination, counsel asked Faubion what makes up a title plant, and she responded \"[t]he\r\nrecords, the equipment, the files.\"  She explained that an abstract plant is comprised of the records\r\nwhich show property title.  The following exchange then occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Appellants' counsel]:  What do you mean by 'files'?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Faubion]:  I mean the existing files that were left there.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Appellants' counsel]:  People that had asked for commitments.

Right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Faubion]:  Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Faubion's testimony as to the meaning of the term \"files\" is incompetent parol evidence because\r\nAppellants, who have asserted throughout trial and appeal that the contracts are unambiguous,\r\noffered it to explain the meaning of the term \"files\" in the Bill of Sale.  <em>Swinnea v.

There is no language in the real\r\nproperty contract or the bill of sale by which Freida unambiguously expressed an intent to transfer\r\nto Joy the right to the premiums from the Windfarm Projects as part of the sale.  Considering the\r\nsurrounding circumstances, we conclude that the real property contract is only partially integrated\r\nbecause it does not fully address the transfer of personal property and it does not address at all the\r\nright to the premiums from the pending title commitment orders.  McFadden's expert witness, Bert\r\nMassey, expressed an expert opinion that he would have expected the contract between the parties\r\nto address accounts receivable, accounts payable, and work in progress, but it did not.  He went on\r\nto explain that he would have expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to outstanding\r\nobligations of Ellyson Abstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which had not yet\r\nbeen received, and what value to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed.  Referring\r\nto the two outstanding orders for title commitments, Massey expected to see something in an\r\nagreement relating to what compensation, if any, the prior owner would receive for the work that was\r\ndone but not paid for up until the time the transaction closed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe parties' oral agreement that Joy would pay Freida the premiums when the Windfarm\r\nProjects closed does not contradict the written agreement.  Therefore, the evidence regarding the oral\r\ncontract is competent evidence and the oral contract does not violate the merger doctrine.

Before his\r\nmother died, Bruce McFadden asked employees at Ellyson Abstract on several occasions whether\r\nthe Windfarm Projects had closed.  Each time, the employees said they had not.  While driving along\r\nI-10 in July 2002, Bruce saw that the windfarm had gone up.  Consequently, he called Joy and asked\r\nher if the Windfarm Projects had closed.  She said they had, and Bruce asked when his mother was\r\ngoing to get her money.  Joy replied, \"I've been beating myself about the head and shoulders trying\r\nto figure out a way to get her paid.\"  Joy revealed that she had been speaking to the Texas Insurance\r\nCommission and they would not allow Joy to pay her.  Bruce told Joy that it was his mother's\r\nretirement money and she was counting on it.  He then asked Joy whether she had used his mother's\r\nmoney to buy the new $65,000 Cadillac Escalade he had seen sitting in the parking lot.  Joy replied,\r\n\"Bruce, I haven't spent one dime of your mother's money on that car.\"  Bruce told Joy he would call\r\nher the next day and they hung up.  Bruce called her a couple of days later and Joy advised him that\r\nshe had an attorney and Bruce should call him.  Bruce also testified that after the sale of Ellyson\r\nAbstract, his mother had retained an Ellyson Abstract escrow account to receive the premiums from\r\nthe Windfarm Projects.  According to him, there would have been no other reason for her to keep\r\nan escrow account.  His mother kept the account open until the day she died.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJack McIntyre, an independent businessman, spoke with Freida in July or August of 2000\r\nabout purchasing Ellyson Abstract.  Freida said the sale would include the building and the business\r\nbut she clearly indicated to him that she would retain two \"windmill contracts.\"  She did not\r\nspecifically tell McIntyre what the contracts were worth but he understood that it was a substantial\r\namount of money.  McIntyre did not purchase the business because he could not afford it at the time. \r\n\tBrenda Faubion worked for both Freida and Joy at Ellyson Abstract.  On March 30, 2001,\r\nEllyson Abstract remitted two cashier's checks to \"Freida McFadden dba Ellyson Abstract,\" one in\r\nthe amount of $4,405.87 and the other in the amount of $6,567.83.  On August 8, 2001, Rosie\r\nCausey, an Ellyson Abstract employee, sent a check to Freida in the amount of $5,631 with the\r\nnotation \"Woodward Mtn TWP-06-03.\"  Causey attached a note which stated, \"Freida, I know this\r\nisn't exactly what you were expecting, but we've had to separate the charges for Cielo and Chicago\r\nTitle.  Cielo is paying for their charges but we have not received anything from Chicago.\"  Freida\r\ncalled Ellyson Abstract and spoke with Faubion about these checks.  Faubion told Freida that Joy\r\nhad instructed them to send the checks to her.  Freida asked her whether the main part of the\r\ntransaction had closed and Faubion told her it had not.  Freida said that she was not going to cash\r\nthe checks because she believed the deal was going to close and she did not want it to appear that\r\nshe was agreeing to take the lesser amount of money.  Freida indicated to Faubion she expected to\r\nreceive the money when the deal closed because they had done 90 percent of the work.\r\nApproximately six months after the sale of Ellyson Abstract, Faubion spoke with Bruce McFadden. \r\nHe asked her whether the Windfarm Projects had closed.  She told him they had not.  Two weeks\r\nlater, Bruce went to the office and spoke with Faubion about uncashed checks he had found. \r\nAccording to Faubion, some of the checks were for title policy premiums that had been collected\r\nafter Joy had purchased Ellyson Abstract.  Faubion assumed that those checks had not been cashed\r\nbecause they had been misplaced.  Three or four other checks were from Cielo Land on the Chicago\r\nTitle transaction.  Faubion knew from her prior conversation with Freida that she purposely had not\r\ncashed those checks.  Faubion recalled that after Ellyson Abstract received the money for the Stewart\r\nTitle policy, Joy told her that she did not know whether she would be able to give Freida any of the\r\nmoney.  Joy explained that she had contacted Stewart Title in San Antonio and they questioned\r\nwhether it was legal for Joy to disburse any of it to Freida.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMelody Tijerina, a former employee of Ellyson Abstract, testified that Joy warned the\r\nemployees if <em>any</em> of them told Freida that the money from the Windfarm Projects had come in, she\r\nwould fire <em>all</em> of them.  It was because of this threat that Tijerina never told Freida that the money\r\nhad been received.  Tijerina knew Joy's threat was related to a condition of the sale of Ellyson\r\nAbstract to Joy.  Tijerina quit working for Ellyson Abstract in 2001 because of Joy's conduct and\r\nshe moved to Idaho.  Tijerina regretted never telling Freida that the money from the Windfarm\r\nProjects had been received in July of 2001, but she told Bruce in January of 2006 what she knew. \r\n\tFinally, McFadden offered expert testimony to prove the existence of an oral agreement. \r\nBert Massey is a Texas attorney who practices real estate law and has owned a title insurance agency\r\nsince 1980.  Massey is also a licensed escrow officer and is an approved examining attorney of real\r\nestate titles for five title insurance underwriting companies who do business in Texas.  Massey has\r\nqualified as an expert on title insurance in proceedings before the  State Insurance Board and State\r\nInsurance Commission.  In preparation for his testimony, Massey reviewed a large amount of\r\ndocuments, including the order sheets on two potential title insurance transactions and the documents\r\nrelated to the sale of Ellyson Abstract to Joy.  He also reviewed McFadden's trial exhibit notebooks. \r\nIn Massey's opinion, there was an oral agreement between the parties.  He based his opinion on the\r\nissuance of checks from Ellyson Abstract  to Freida, the former owner.  He stated there had to\r\nbe an agreement relating to some matters that were going to happen after the closing because there\r\nwould have been no need for the payments to be made after the business was sold.  In connection\r\nwith his review of the documents pertaining to the sale of Ellyson Abstract to Joy, Massey testified\r\nthat the written contracts did not address accounts receivable, accounts payable, and work in\r\nprogress.  He explained that he would have expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to\r\noutstanding obligations of Ellyson Abstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which\r\nhad not yet been received, and what value to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed. \r\nReferring to the two outstanding orders for title commitments related to the Windfarm Projects,\r\nMassey expected to see something in an agreement relating to what compensation, if any, the prior\r\nowner would receive for the work that was done but not paid for up until the time the transaction\r\nclosed.  The written agreements did not address any of these matters.  Massey concluded that the\r\nparties must have had an oral agreement because Ellyson Abstract paid monies to Freida after the\r\nsale.  In his thirty-six years in the title insurance business, Massey had never worked on any title\r\ncommitments as valuable as the Windfarm Projects.  In his opinion, there was no question that most\r\nrural title insurance companies would consider these to be the deals of a lifetime.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to expert testimony, there was other evidence relevant to the existence of an oral\r\ncontract.  Freida offered to sell the business to Jack McIntyre but made clear to him that the sale\r\nwould not include the Windfarm Projects.  Joy purchased the business for one-half of the price she\r\nhad been quoted two years earlier.  After purchasing Ellyson Abstract, Joy threatened to fire her\r\nemployees if any of them told Freida that Ellyson Abstract had received the money from the\r\nWindfarm Projects.  Melody Tijerina knew that Joy's threat was related to a condition of the sale of\r\nEllyson Abstract.  Joy had Ellyson Abstract employees forward checks to Freida several months after\r\nthe sale.  After Ellyson Abstract received the proceeds from the Stewart Title deal, Joy told Brenda\r\nFaubion that she did not know whether she would be able to give the money to Freida.  This is\r\ncontrary to her position at trial that Freida did not retain any right to the premiums when she sold the\r\nbusiness.  Similarly, when Bruce McFadden called Joy in July 2001 about the closing of the\r\nWindfarm Projects and his mother's money, Joy did not indicate any surprise or disagreement that\r\nFreida expected to receive money in connection with the closing of the Windfarm Projects but\r\ninstead said she was trying to figure out a way for his mother to get \"her money.\"  When Bruce asked\r\nJoy whether she had purchased a new vehicle with his mother's money, Joy again referred to the\r\nmoney as Freida's money and insisted she had not spent one penny of \"your mother's money.\" \r\nWhen viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the foregoing evidence supports a conclusion\r\nthat Freida retained the right to the premiums from the Windfarm Projects when she sold the\r\nbusiness to Joy, and Joy and Freida had an oral agreement that Freida would receive the premiums\r\nwhen Windfarm Projects closed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><em>Factual Sufficiency</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a challenge to the factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting a vital fact, we\r\nmust consider, weigh, and examine all of the evidence in the record, both supporting and against the\r\nfinding, to decide whether the verdict should be set aside.  <em>Plas-Tex, Inc. v.

A party\r\nseeking attorneys' fees must show that the fees were incurred on a claim that allows recovery of such\r\nfees, and thus is ordinarily required to segregate fees incurred on claims allowing recovery of fees\r\nfrom those that do not.  <em>Stewart Title Guaranty Company v.

In\r\n<em>Tony Gullo Motors</em>, the Supreme Court eliminated the exception to the segregation requirement for\r\nfees incurred solely on a separate but intertwined claim.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14. \r\nIf any attorneys' fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, the claimant\r\nmust segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.  <em>Id.</em> at 313.  This standard does not require\r\nattorneys to keep separate time records when they draft the breach of contract and fraud paragraphs\r\nof a petition.  <em>See id.</em> at 314.  The amount of recoverable attorneys' fees is sufficiently segregated if,\r\nfor example, the attorney testifies that a given percentage of the drafting time would have been\r\nnecessary even if the claim for which attorneys' fees are recoverable had not been asserted.  <em>Id. </em> at\r\n314; <em>see CA Partners</em>, 274 S.W.3d at 82; <em>7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v.

McFadden argues\r\nthat Appellants failed to ask any questions during cross-examination regarding the need to segregate. \r\nAppellants were not required to cross-examine on the issue because it was McFadden's burden to\r\nprove that fee segregation is not required.  <em>See CA Partners</em>, 274 S.W.3d at 82.  It cannot be disputed\r\nthat a portion of counsel's time was spent drafting the pleadings related to the tort claims.  While\r\nMcFadden might argue that this time is nominal, unrecoverable fees are not rendered recoverable\r\nmerely because they are nominal.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 313; <em>CA Partners</em>, 274\r\nS.W.3d at 84.  Consequently, we find that McFadden was required to segregate.  <em>See CA Partners</em>,\r\n274 S.W.3d at 84.  We sustain Issue Seven.  McFadden did not forfeit his right to recover attorney's\r\nfees by failing to segregate them because the evidence he presented regarding the total amount\r\nconstitutes some evidence of what the segregated amount should be.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212\r\nS.W.3d at 314; <em>CA Partners</em>, 274 S.W.3d at 84.  Therefore, a remand for a new trial on recoverable\r\nattorney's fees is the appropriate remedy.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ADMISSION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Issue Eight, Appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the\r\nexpert testimony of Bert Massey.

Those were not the only\r\npayments made to Freida and the existence of the payments was not the only basis for Massey's\r\nopinion.  By virtue of his experience, Massey was familiar with the operations of a title company and\r\nwith what is involved when such a business is sold.  Massey found it unusual that the written\r\ndocuments did not address accounts receivable, accounts payable, and work in progress.  He would\r\nhave expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to outstanding obligations of Ellyson\r\nAbstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which had not yet been received, and what\r\nvalue to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed.  Under these circumstances,\r\nMassey concluded that there must have been an oral agreement.

A party must disclose a testifying\r\nexpert's mental impressions and opinions and any methods used to derive them.  Tex.R.Civ.P.\r\n192.3(e)(4).  A party may request disclosure of the general substance of the testifying expert's mental\r\nimpressions and opinions and a brief summary of the basis for them.  Tex.R.Civ.P. 194.2(f)(3).  The\r\nRules of Civil Procedure impose on a party an ongoing duty to supplement or amend its discovery\r\nresponses.  <em>See</em> Tex.R. Civ. P. 193.5.

Massey expected the parties to have an agreement pertaining to outstanding\r\nobligations of Ellyson Abstract, to income that the seller expected to receive but which had not yet\r\nbeen received, and what value to place on transactions in progress that had not yet closed.  Although\r\nit was not specifically stated, Massey's conclusion that the parties had an oral agreement about these\r\nmatters falls within the disclosure.

Appellants contend that the pleadings and evidence do not\r\nsupport piercing the corporate veil.  They additionally assert that Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Company,\r\nL.L.C. is a limited liability <em>company</em>, not a limited liability<em> corporation.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the original petition, McFadden named as defendants Joy B. and E.

McFadden amended the petition to include Ellyson\r\nAbstract &amp; Title Co., L.L.C. as a defendant.  The petition alleged that Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title Co.,\r\nL.L.C. is a limited liability corporation licensed to do business in Texas.  Contrary to Appellants'\r\ncontention on appeal that Ellyson Abstract is a limited liability <em>company</em>, Joy testified that Ellyson\r\nAbstract &amp; Title Co., L.L.C. is a limited liability <em>corporation </em>and she is the president and sole\r\nstockholder.  She formed the L.L.C. in 1999 prior to purchasing Ellyson Abstract from Freida. \r\nAccording to Joy, the L.L.C. owns the abstract plant and the equipment while she and her husband\r\npersonally own the building.  The evidence at trial showed that the L.L.C. received the premiums\r\nfrom the Stewart Title project.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA person's status as a vice-principal of the corporation is sufficient to impute liability to the\r\ncorporation.  <em>GTE Southwest, Inc. v.

When actions are taken by a vice-principal of a\r\ncorporation, those acts may be deemed to be the acts of the corporation itself.  <em>Id.</em>  A vice-principal\r\nencompasses four classes of corporate agents: (a) corporate officers; (b) those who have authority\r\nto employ, direct, and discharge servants of the master; (c) those engaged in the performance of\r\nnondelegable or absolute duties of the master; and (d) those to whom a master has confided the\r\nmanagement of the whole or a department or division of his business.  <em> Hammerly Oaks, Inc. v.\r\nEdwards</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1578192\"><a href=\"/opinion/1578192/hammerly-oaks-inc-v-edwards/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 391 (Tex. 1997).  Courts use the vice-principal doctrine to distinguish\r\nbetween the acts of the corporation itself and that of a mere servant or employee.  <em>Id.</em>  Acts of a\r\n\"mere servant or employee\" are the basis for corporate liability based on the doctrine of <em>respondeat\r\nsuperior</em>.  <em>Id.</em>  The liability of the master for the negligent acts of his vice principal is placed upon\r\nvery different grounds, namely, that the negligent acts of the vice principal are the very acts of the\r\ncorporation itself.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe undisputed evidence established that Joy is a vice-principal of Ellyson Abstract &amp; Title\r\nCo., L.L.C , and the monies which McFadden sought to recover were received by the L.L.C. and\r\nwere not paid to Freida.

Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Tony Gullo Motors</em>, the exception applied when two or more claims\r\nwere dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances and thus were intertwined to the point of being inseparable. \r\n<em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 311 (discussing exception created by <em>Stewart Title Guaranty Company v. \r\nSterling</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 11-12 (Tex.  1991).  Courts referred to the claims as being \"inextricably intertwined\" and fee\r\nsegregation was not required.  <em>See Tony Gullo Motors</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 311.  Noting that the exception threatened to\r\nswallow the rule, the Supreme Court eliminated this formulation of the exception.  <em>Id</em>., 212 S.W.3d at 312-13.\r\n</p><p>9.   The claims against E.
