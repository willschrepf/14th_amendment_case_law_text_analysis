GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:\n\n     In this age discrimination case, the question is whether the\n\nMississippi River pilot associations are “employers” of the member\n\npilots for the purposes of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 621, et. seq.          The question is difficult and\n\nyields no straightforward answer.           The defendant associations are\n\nlong-standing, peculiarly conducted institutions recognized by\n\nstatute, owned and governed by their member pilots, and serving as\n\na sort of clearinghouse and dispatching service for the river\n\npilots.     There is no doubt that if the plaintiff suffered age\n\ndiscrimination, it was administered by the hands of the defendant\n\nassociations because of their age-restrictive policies. Yet, there\n\nis an absence of any traditional employer relationship, traditional\n\nindependent-contractor relationship, hiring-hall relationship, or\n\nemployment-agency relationship between the associations and the\n\npilots.\n\n     Terry Coleman (“Coleman”), born October 1, 1951, brought suit\n\nagainst the New Orleans & Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association\n\n(“NOBRA”)    and    the    Crescent    River   Port      Pilot’s   Association\n\n(“Crescent”),      as     well   as   the   Board   of    River    Port   Pilot\n\nCommissioners (the “Crescent Board”), alleging that these entities\n\nunlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his age in\n\nviolation of the ADEA.           They did so, he claims, by refusing to\n\nelect him into their respective pilot apprenticeship programs\n\nbecause he was too old under their membership qualifications.               The\n\n                                        2\n\fDistrict Court granted summary judgment in these separately filed\n\nactions to NOBRA, Crescent, and the Crescent Board, holding that\n\nthese entities are not “employers” within the meaning of the ADEA\n\nand therefore cannot be held liable under the ADEA.               Because both\n\ncases present similar legal issues, we consider them together in\n\nthis opinion.\n\n      We hold that NOBRA, Crescent, and the Crescent Board are not\n\n“employers” of river pilots within the meaning of the ADEA.               These\n\nentities are therefore not subject to the ADEA’s prohibitions on\n\nage discrimination in employment.            Accordingly, we AFFIRM the\n\nDistrict Court’s grants of summary judgment to NOBRA, Crescent, and\n\nthe Crescent Board.\n\n                                     I\n\n      In our effort to determine whether any of the defendants meet\n\nthe   definition   of   “employer”   under    the   ADEA,    we    must   first\n\nunderstand Louisiana’s body of rules and regulations governing the\n\nlicensing of Mississippi River pilots and the relationship among\n\npilots, boards of examiners, and pilots’ associations in the\n\noperation of the pilot apprenticeship programs.             Only then can we\n\nfully understand the organizational structure of the defendant\n\npilots’ associations and its bearing on the question of liability\n\nunder the ADEA.\n\n                                     A\n\n      Louisiana state law requires that local pilots guide foreign\n\nships along Louisiana waterways, including the Mississippi River.\n\n                                     3\n\fThe Louisiana portion of the Mississippi River is divided into\n\nthree zones.         See generally Hendrix v. Louisiana Public Service\n\nCommission, 263 So.2d 343, 345 (1972). “Bar pilots” or “associated\n\nbranch pilots” guide vessels in and out of the entrance of the\n\nMississippi River between Pilottown and the Gulf of Mexico.1                    LA.\n\nREV. STAT. § 34:941, et. seq.           “River port pilots” guide vessels\n\nbetween Pilottown and New Orleans. LA. REV. STAT. § 34:991, et. seq.\n\n“New Orleans and Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots” guide seagoing\n\nvessels from the port of New Orleans to the port of Baton Rouge and\n\nintermediate        ports.      LA. REV. STAT.   §    34:1041,    et.   seq.     An\n\nindividual who wishes to serve as a pilot in any of these zones\n\nmust receive a commission from the Governor of Louisiana entitling\n\nhim to work as a pilot on a particular stretch of the river.\n\nReceiving a commission is a multi-step process.\n\n       Regulation of the process of applying to be a pilot is mainly\n\nthe responsibility of the state regulatory boards created for this\n\nspecific purpose.            The Board of River Port Pilot Commissioners\n\n(“Crescent Board”) is authorized by statute to “hold examinations\n\nunder such rules and regulations, and with such requirements as\n\nthey       shall   have   provided,”   to   certify    to   the   Governor     that\n\napplicants are qualified to be river port pilots.                 LA. REV. STAT. §\n\n34:991, 993.        The Board of Examiners for the New Orleans and Baton\n\nRouge Steamship Pilots (“NOBRA Board”) is similarly authorized to\n\n       1\n           Bar pilots and their association are not at issue in this\ncase.\n\n                                        4\n\fcertify qualified applicants to the Governor to be New Orleans and\n\nBaton Rouge Steamship Pilots.         LA. REV. STAT. § 34:1042, 1045.             Each\n\nof these boards is comprised of three citizens holding commissions\n\nfor the appropriate stretch of the river.            LA. REV. STAT. § 34:991,\n\n1042.     The     Governor   appoints       individuals    to    serve       on   the\n\ncommissions.      Id.\n\n      An individual must first petition the appropriate board for a\n\ndetermination of his qualifications.2           A few specific requirements\n\nfor qualified pilots are set out by statute.              Before the Crescent\n\nBoard may certify the candidate to the Governor for commissioning,\n\nriver port pilots are required to (1) be of good moral character,\n\n(2) be a voter of the state of Louisiana, and (3) have completed an\n\napproved apprenticeship program.             LA. REV. STAT. § 34:993.             New\n\nOrleans and Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots are required by statute to\n\n(1) be of good moral character, (2) be a voter of the state of\n\nLouisiana, (3) have a first class pilot license issued by the\n\nUnited    States    Coast    Guard,    and     (4)   complete         a    six-month\n\napprenticeship.     LA. REV. STAT. § 34:1045.\n\n      The Crescent Board and the NOBRA Board are authorized by\n\nstatute to provide additional requirements for individuals seeking\n\nto   become     pilots.      Among    myriad    licensing       and       educational\n\nrequirements, the Crescent Board requires that the individual “must\n\n      2\n      This exact process does not appear to be mandated by statute,\nbut rather the result of the regulations promulgated by the boards\nof commissioners/examiners and the respective pilots’ association\nfor the particular stretch of the river.\n\n                                        5\n\fnot have reached his fortieth birthday prior to the first day of\n\nballoting on apprentices by the river port pilots.” LA. ADMIN. CODE\n\ntit. 46 § 3201(C) (2003) (emphasis added).                      The NOBRA Board\n\nrequires that the individual “shall not have reached his or her\n\nforty-fifth birthday before being commissioned.”                     LA. ADMIN. CODE\n\ntit. 46, § 6107 (2003) (emphasis added).\n\n     An individual applying to be an apprentice first submits his\n\napplication to the appropriate board of commissioners/examiners for\n\ncertification    that      the    individual    is   a   qualified      apprentice\n\ncandidate.     Because apprenticeships must be completed under the\n\nsupervision of a commissioned pilot, and because only a limited\n\nnumber of pilots are allowed by law, certification by the board as\n\na qualified candidate does not guarantee an individual a place in\n\nthe apprenticeship program. The individual must then be elected to\n\napprenticeship by a majority vote of the pilots’ association for\n\nthe respective stretch of the river.\n\n     Once    elected,      the   candidate     completes    a    board-certified\n\napprenticeship       program     under   the   supervision      of    commissioned\n\npilots.      The boards retain the right to require satisfactory\n\ncompletion      of     the       apprenticeship      program,         extend     the\n\napprenticeship,       or   terminate     the   apprenticeship         when     deemed\n\nnecessary.      LA. ADMIN. CODE tit. 46, § 6107(L) (2003).                      Upon\n\ncompletion of the apprenticeship program, the boards examine the\n\napprentices as to their knowledge of pilotage and their proficiency\n\nand capability to serve as commissioned pilots.              LA. ADMIN. CODE tit.\n\n                                         6\n\f46, § 6107(M)(2) (2003).         If the board deems the apprentice\n\nqualified, the board certifies the apprentice to the Governor for\n\ncommissioning.    The Governor may then appoint, in his discretion,\n\nthe individual to an existing vacancy.           LA. REV. STAT. §§ 34:993,\n\n1045.\n\n                                     B\n\n     The   pilots’     associations       that   elect   individuals      to\n\napprenticeships exist pursuant to Louisiana law giving pilots the\n\nright to “form themselves into an association or associations as to\n\nthem may seem fit, not in conflict with law . . . .”         LA. REV. STAT.\n\n§ 34:995; LA. REV. STAT. § 1047.         Crescent and NOBRA periodically\n\nhold elections for apprenticeship when each respectively determines\n\nthat a need exists for new pilots.         The associations select only\n\nthe number of apprenticeship candidates commensurate with the\n\nnumber of new pilots needed.3\n\n     Crescent    and   NOBRA   are   incorporated    under   the   laws   of\n\n     3\n      The NOBRA Board’s regulations provide that an applicant “must\nhave been duly elected an apprentice in the New Orleans and Baton\nRouge Steamship Pilots Association as per Association rules in\neffect as of such application.” LA. ADMIN. CODE tit. 46, § 6107\n(2003). The legal source of this voting process for the Crescent\nBoard and Crescent is unclear. We have found nothing in the law\nrequiring only so many individuals be apprenticed as there are open\nseats, although this does make practical sense. Similarly, we have\nfound nothing in the law requiring that the association elect\napprentices by majority vote, although the fact that, as a\npractical matter, all pilots are association members makes this\nprocess sensible and efficient. What is clear, however, is that\nthis process is long-standing and a matter of tradition for the\npilots. See generally Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Com’rs\nfor Port of New Orleans, 25 So.2d 527, 755-58 (1946), aff’d 330\nU.S. 552 (1947).\n\n                                     7\n\fLouisiana as non-profit corporations.       LA. REV. STAT. § 12:201 et\n\nseq.   Crescent’s Charter provides that the objects and purposes of\n\nthe corporation are, in relevant part:\n\n           To provide efficient means for dispatching\n           Crescent River Port Pilots to ships and\n           vessels assigned and requiring the services of\n           such pilots on an equitable basis, providing\n           for the collection and disbursement of fees\n           and charges of whatsoever nature and kind\n           incident to the performance of such services,\n           and making distribution thereof among the\n           shareholders   of   this   corporation   after\n           deducting all legitimate and approved expenses\n           of the operation of same.\n\n           To provide for a pension and welfare plan for\n           retired shareholders of this corporation, and\n           for their families.\n\n           ***\n\n           To inculcate, secure and maintain skill,\n           discipline, merit and efficiency in the pilots\n           engaged in piloting vessels over the pilotage\n           waters assigned to the Crescent River Port\n           Pilots, promoting and assisting the commerce\n           and prosperity of the Port of New Orleans.\n\nNOBRA’s   Charter   similarly   provides,   albeit   with   much   less\n\nspecificity, that the purpose of the association is\n\n           To carry on the business of piloting sea-going\n           and other vessels on the Mississippi River,\n           between the Mississippi River Ports of New\n           Orleans and Baton Rouge and return, for fees,\n           and to shift vessels in the harbors of\n           Harahan, Avondale, St. Rose, Destrehan, Good\n           Hope, Norco, Reserve, Burnside, Gramercy and\n           other harbors to and including Baton Rouge,\n           Louisiana, in accordance with Act 291 of the\n           Legislature of 1942 of the State of Louisiana\n           (Louisiana   Revised   Statutes  34:1041,   et\n           sequitur); and to inculcate, secure and\n           maintain   skill,    discipline,   merit   and\n           efficiency in the pilots engaged in this\n\n                                  8\n\f           business, and to thereby promote and assist\n           the commerce and prosperity of said ports and\n           intermediate ports.\n\nEach association is owned by its members; each member pilot holds\n\none share of the association’s stock.\n\n     The primary business of both associations is to receive\n\nrequests for pilotage from ship agents and dispatch pilots to those\n\nvessels.   The associations also collect the fees from the shipping\n\ncompanies for the pilotage work performed.     The receipts, minus\n\ngeneral overhead expenses, are remitted monthly to member pilots in\n\naccordance with an established formula based on the number of days\n\neach individual was available for piloting.    The associations do\n\nnot withhold tax or FICA on the monies distributed to pilot\n\nmembers, and pilots’ pay is reflected on IRS Form 1099, rather than\n\nIRS Form W-2.\n\n     Membership in an association is not required by law, but most,\n\nif not all, pilots currently commissioned in the NOBRA and Crescent\n\nstretches of the river are members of the appropriate association.\n\n\n\n                                 II\n\n                                 A\n\n     Despite the complexity of the interrelationships and the\n\nworking arrangements among the associations and the pilots, the\n\nfacts underlying Coleman’s claims are simple.     Coleman, born on\n\nOctober 6, 1951, is an experienced ship captain who sought to\n\nbecome a commissioned pilot on the NOBRA and Crescent stretches of\n\n                                 9\n\fthe Mississippi River.\n\n     Coleman   submitted   an   application    for   the   apprenticeship\n\nprogram to the NOBRA Board in 1996.      NOBRA held an election for\n\napprentices in 2001, but Coleman’s name did not appear on the\n\nballot as a certified candidate for apprenticeship. At the time of\n\nthe NOBRA election, Coleman was forty-nine years old.              NOBRA\n\nrequires that an applicant “not [have] reached his forty-fifth\n\n(45th) birth date.”\n\n     Coleman also submitted an application for the apprenticeship\n\nprogram to the Crescent Board in 1999.        Crescent held an election\n\nthat same year, but Coleman’s name did not appear on the ballot as\n\na certified candidate for apprenticeship.            At the time of the\n\nCrescent election, Coleman was forty-seven years old.4        Crescent’s\n\nCharter requires that an applicant “shall not have reached his\n\nfortieth birthday prior to the day of the first ballot for his\n\nelection as an apprentice.”\n\n                                   B\n\n     After filing an EEOC charge against NOBRA and receiving a\n\nright-to-sue letter, Coleman filed an action against NOBRA alleging\n\n\n     4\n      Additional facts are alleged by Coleman and the defendants.\nThese facts, however, are not relevant to the question whether\nthese entities are “employers”, but rather are relevant only to the\nestablishment of a prima facie case of age discrimination and the\nsubsequent McDonnell Douglas analysis.     See generally McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973); Machinchick v. PB\nPower, Inc., 398 F.3d 345, 349-53 (5th Cir. 2005). The District\nCourt did not address whether Coleman established a prima facie\ncase of age discrimination.\n\n                                   10\n\fthat the association unlawfully discriminated against him on the\n\nbasis of his age in violation of the ADEA by failing to elect him\n\ninto the river pilot apprenticeship program.       NOBRA moved for\n\nsummary judgment asserting that it is not an “employer” under the\n\nADEA.   The District Court granted NOBRA summary judgment, finding\n\nthat Coleman did not present a genuine issue of material fact with\n\nrespect to whether NOBRA is an “employer” of river pilots within\n\nthe meaning of the ADEA.      Coleman v. New Orleans Baton Rouge\n\nSteamship Pilots Association, 2004 WL 1237447 (E.D. La. June 1,\n\n2004). The District Court summarily adopted the reasoning of Ehret\n\nv. State of Louisiana, 862 F.Supp. 1546 (E.D. La. 1992), a case\n\nholding that Crescent lacked control over its member pilots and\n\ntherefore was not their employer.      Ehret, in turn, had found\n\npersuasive the analysis in the tort case McKeithen v. The SS\n\nFROSTA, 441 F.Supp. 1213 (E.D.La.1977), which held that NOBRA was\n\nnot vicariously liable as an employer because it exerted no control\n\nover a pilot once he took the helm of a vessel.   McKeithen likened\n\nNOBRA to other professional associations and found NOBRA pilots to\n\nbe independent contractors.\n\n     Coleman also received right-to-sue letters from the EEOC for\n\nhis charges against Crescent and the Crescent Board.   Coleman then\n\nfiled separate actions alleging violations of the ADEA against\n\nCrescent and the Crescent Board, which were consolidated before the\n\nDistrict Court.   Crescent and the Crescent Board both moved for\n\nsummary judgment arguing in part that they are not “employers” or\n\n                                11\n\f“joint employers.” Relying on the same reasoning as the opinion in\n\nthe NOBRA proceeding, the District Court granted Crescent and the\n\nCrescent Board summary judgment.         Coleman v. Crescent River Port\n\nPilot’s Association, Inc., 2004 WL 1278005 (E.D. La. June 8, 2004).\n\n      Coleman now appeals both judgments.5         Thus, we have before us\n\nthe two appeals presenting mutually dispositive issues.\n\n                                   III\n\n      We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same\n\nstandard applied by the District Court.       Hall v. Gillman, Inc., 81\n\nF.3d 35, 36 (5th Cir. 1996).      Summary judgment is appropriate “if\n\nthe   pleadings,   depositions,    answers    to    interrogatories,   and\n\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”          FED. R.\n\nCIV. P. 56(c).\n\n                                    A\n\n                                   (1)\n\n      A primary purpose of the ADEA is to prohibit arbitrary age\n\ndiscrimination in employment.     29 U.S.C. § 621(b).       To accomplish\n\nthis purpose, the ADEA prohibits certain practices by employers,\n\n\n      5\n      Coleman also appeals the District Court’s denial of his\nmotions for reconsideration of the summary judgment motions, or in\nthe alternative new trial.     We do not discuss these issues on\nappeal because Coleman’s argument is underdeveloped, simply arguing\nthat his motions should have been granted to correct the manifest\ninjustice of the District Court’s error in granting summary\njudgment to defendants.\n\n                                   12\n\femployment agencies, and labor organizations.           29 U.S.C. § 623(a)-\n\n(c).   In relevant part, the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer\n\n              to otherwise fail or refuse to hire or to\n              discharge    any    individual    or   otherwise\n              discriminate against any individual with\n              respect    to     his    compensation,    terms,\n              conditions,    or   privileges   of   employment\n              because of such individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1).        An employment agency may not\n\n              fail or refuse to refer for employment, or\n              otherwise   to  discriminate  against,   any\n              individual because of such individual’s age,\n              or to classify or refer for employment any\n              individual on the basis of such individual’s\n              age.\n\n29   U.S.C.    §   623(b).     Finally,   it   is    unlawful   for   a   labor\n\norganization\n\n              (1) to exclude or expel from its membership,\n              or otherwise to discriminate against, any\n              individual because of his age;\n\n              (2) to limit, segregate, or classify its\n              membership, or to classify or fail or refuse\n              to refer for employment any individual, in any\n              way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n              individual of employment opportunities, or\n              would limit such employment opportunities or\n              otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n              employee or as an applicant for employment,\n              because of such individual’s age;\n\n              (3) to cause or attempt to cause an employer\n              to discriminate against an individual in\n              violation of this section.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(c).          Although the prohibitions of the ADEA are\n\nbroad in scope, the reach of the ADEA is limited by the statute’s\n\nown definitions of “employer,” “employment agency,” and “labor\n\norganization.”       See 29 U.S.C. § 630.           If an entity is not an\n\n                                     13\n\femployer, employment agency, or labor organization, it is not\n\nsubject to the prohibitions of the ADEA against age discrimination\n\nin employment.\n\n     The question that confronts us is whether Crescent6 and NOBRA\n\nare entities that are subject to the prohibitions of the ADEA.               The\n\nanswer to this question is not immediately apparent.                We begin by\n\nconsidering each possibility of coverage under the ADEA.\n\n                                       (2)\n\n     We first observe that NOBRA and Crescent cannot be considered\n\n“employment agencies” or “labor organizations” under the ADEA.\n\nColeman has not made such an assertion, but at first glance, NOBRA\n\nand Crescent share characteristics with employment agencies and\n\nlabor    organizations     as   they    are    commonly     understood.      The\n\ndispatching function of the associations, matching pilots with\n\nvessels needing piloting, may be analogized in a general way to the\n\nusual purpose    of   an   employment        agency   or   union   hiring   hall.\n\nHowever, we must deal specifically with the definitions in the\n\nADEA.    NOBRA and Crescent are not labor organizations because they\n\ndo not exist for the “purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with\n\nemployers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of\n\npay, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment . . . .”               29\n\nU.S.C. § 630(d).      Although the ADEA refers to hiring halls, its\n\n\n     6\n      Coleman does not assert that the Crescent Board is an\nemployer standing alone, but rather that the Crescent Board is only\nsubject to the ADEA as a joint employer with Crescent.\n\n                                       14\n\freference is only to explain that a labor organization is “deemed\n\nto be in an industry affecting commerce if (1) it maintains or\n\noperates a hiring hall or hiring office which procures employees\n\nfor an employer or procures for employees opportunities to work for\n\nan employer . . . .”   29 U.S.C. § 630(e).\n\n     Moreover, labor organizations interact with the employer of\n\nthe members of the organization.     A shipowner or charterer is not\n\nthe hired pilot’s employer in the sense relevant here, for it\n\nexercises no control over the pilot’s navigation of the vessel.   We\n\ncan find no argument or authority for deeming pilots anything other\n\nthan independent contractors of the vessels they are hired to\n\nnavigate.   Thus, this term “employer” prevents our finding that\n\nNOBRA and Crescent are employment agencies, which are defined as\n\n“any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to\n\nprocure employees for an employer and includes an agent of such\n\nperson . . . .”   29 U.S.C. § 630(c) (emphasis added).\n\n     Despite the functional similarities between the associations\n\nand labor organizations/employment agencies, because of the ADEA\n\ndefinitions of the two types of entities, we are left to consider\n\nonly whether NOBRA and Crescent are employers of their member\n\npilots.   The ADEA defines an “employer” as “a person engaged in an\n\nindustry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees for\n\neach working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the\n\ncurrent or preceding calendar year. . . .”      29 U.S.C. § 630(b).\n\nThis definition, however, provides little guidance in determining\n\n                                15\n\fwhether a particular entity is in fact an employer; the statute\n\nsimply   defines   “employee”   as   “an   individual   employed   by   any\n\nemployer . . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 630(f).7\n\n     The circular language defining “employer” at least states\n\nclearly that an entity must employ twenty or more employees to\n\nsatisfy the ADEA definition of employer. Whether Crescent or NOBRA\n\nhas more than twenty employees depends entirely on whether the\n\npilots are considered to be employees of the associations.         We are\n\nthus left with the sole question whether the pilots are the\n\nassociations’ employees, a term not substantively defined by the\n\nstatute.8\n\n     7\n      The terms “employer” and “employee” have been identically\ntreated under the ADEA and Title VII. Thus, cases interpreting the\nterms under either statute may be considered in determining whether\nthe defendants are employers for the purposes of the ADEA.      See\nFields v. Hallsville Indep. School Dist., 906 F.2d 1017, 1020 n.7\n(5th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1026 (1991).\n     8\n      As noted above, the District Court relied on Ehret’s multi-\nfactor right-to-control analysis to hold that the pilots are not\nemployees of the associations. Coleman asserts that Ehret is no\nlonger controlling law because the post-Ehret promulgation of 29\nC.F.R. § 1625.21 clarified that NOBRA and Crescent are employers at\nleast with respect to the apprenticeship program. Coleman notes\nthat the EEOC specifically referred to 29 C.F.R. § 1625.21 in\nfinding that cause existed to believe that Coleman was\ndiscriminated against because of his age. Coleman also notes that\ncourts have allowed plaintiffs to proceed against operators of\nsimilar apprenticeship programs for violations of the ADEA. See\nEEOC v. Joint Apprenticeship Committee, 186 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.\n1999).\n\n     We think Coleman misreads the scope of 29 C.F.R. § 1625.21.\nWe agree with the District Court that the regulation “expands the\ncoverage of the ADEA to applicants for apprenticeship programs, but\ndoes not expand the classes of persons liable pursuant to the ADEA\nas set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 623.” Coleman v. New Orleans Baton\n\n                                     16\n\f                                      (3)\n\n      We have come all this way to arrive at the point suggested by\n\nthe   previous   cases   and   indeed       by   the   District   Court:     the\n\ntouchstone of our analysis centers around the common-law notion of\n\ncontrol of the individual. Our approach to the question of control\n\ntakes   a   somewhat     different    path,       however.        In   Clackamas\n\nGastroenterology Associates, P.C. v. Wells, 538 U.S. 440 (2003),\n\nthe Supreme Court approved the EEOC’s gloss on the control standard\n\nin questioning whether a partner, officer, major shareholder, or\n\ndirector qualifies as an employee.           Given the relationship between\n\nthe pilots and the associations, which we have earlier described in\n\ndetail, we find such an analysis specifically appropriate.                   The\n\nEEOC framed the issue as “whether the individual acts independently\n\nand participates in managing the organization, or whether the\n\nindividual is subject to the organization’s control.”                  Id. at 448\n\n(internal citation omitted).         The Court specifically embraced the\n\nEEOC’s proposed six factors relevant to determining whether a\n\nshareholder/director is an employee of the organization:\n\n\nRouge Steamship Pilots Ass’n, 2004 WL 1237447, at *3 (E.D. La. June\n1, 2004). Section 1625.21 did not alter 29 C.F.R. § 1625.1, which\nprovides that “the terms person, employer, employment agency, labor\norganization, and employee shall have the meanings set forth in §\n11 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended,\n29 U.S.C. 621 et. seq. . . . .” The regulation itself makes clear\nthat it does not expand liability beyond “employers” by\nspecifically referencing the “prohibitions of Section IV of the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. §\n623.”    The Second Circuit’s decision in Joint Apprenticeship\nCommittee is not to the contrary because it simply assumed that an\nemployer-employee relationship existed. 186 F.3d at 115.\n\n                                      17\n\f     (1)   Whether the organization can hire or fire the individual\n\n           or set the rules and regulations of the individual’s work\n\n     (2)   Whether, and if so, to what extent the organization\n\n           supervises the individual’s work\n\n     (3)   Whether the individual reports to someone higher in the\n\n           organization\n\n     (4)   Whether, and if so, to what extent the individual is able\n\n           to influence the organization\n\n     (5)   Whether the parties intended that the individual be an\n\n           employee, as expressed in written agreements or contracts\n\n     (6)   Whether the individual shares in the profits, losses, and\n\n           liabilities of the organization.\n\nId. at 449-50.     We now apply these Supreme Court/EEOC factors to\n\nthe pilots’ relationship to the defendant associations.\n\n     The   first   factor   we   consider   is   whether   the   pilots’\n\nassociations hire and fire the member pilots.         Despite Coleman’s\n\narguments to the contrary, they do not.          Certainly, the pilots’\n\nassociations do have the power to elect apprentices and to admit\n\npilots into their membership.      The associations, however, do not\n\nhave the power to grant commissions that permit the pilot to work\n\nin the profession; pilots receive their commissions from the\n\nGovernor, and the associations cannot decommission a pilot.         With\n\nrespect to the actual job performed -- piloting -- the role of the\n\nassociations is essentially that of dispatching pilots to the ships\n\nneeding them; the vessel engages the pilot and the master of the\n\n                                   18\n\fvessel can refuse the services of a particular pilot.          This first\n\nfactor weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.\n\n     The   second   and   third    factors    ask   whether   the    pilots’\n\nassociations supervise the individual pilot’s work and whether the\n\npilot reports to someone “higher” in the association.               As noted\n\nearlier, the primary business of the associations is to receive\n\nrequests for pilotage, dispatch pilots to the vessels, and collect\n\nand disburse pilotage fees.       The associations do not supervise the\n\npilots in their work, nor is there a chain of command in the\n\nperformance of their work -- the individual pilot gives navigation\n\nadvice independently according to his own professional judgment.\n\nThese two factors therefore weigh against labeling the pilots ADEA\n\nemployees.\n\n     The fourth factor asks to what extent the pilots are able to\n\ninfluence the pilots’ associations.       Pilots constitute the entire\n\nbody of shareholders of their respective associations.          Each pilot\n\nholds an equal share and participates in the election of directors\n\nof the association and in shareholder-approval votes.           Thus, the\n\npilots exert substantial influence over the general management of\n\nthe association as well as the promulgation of association rules\n\nand regulations specifically.        This factor, too, weighs against\n\nlabeling the pilots ADEA employees.\n\n     The fifth factor asks whether the parties intended that the\n\nindividual pilot be an employee.             Clearly not.     Each of the\n\ncharters of NOBRA and Crescent makes unequivocal that no employment\n\n                                     19\n\frelationship is intended; these charters expressly define the\n\nrelationship   between     the   pilots      and    the   association   as    an\n\nassociation for the mutual benefit of the member pilots.                   This\n\nfactor also weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.\n\n     The sixth factor asks whether the pilots share in the profits,\n\nlosses, and liabilities of the association.               Pilots share in the\n\n“profits” of the association (and the “losses” if times are not\n\ngood) by receiving a share of collected fees according to a set\n\nformula agreed upon by the shareholder pilots themselves.               At the\n\nsame time, the associations have no respondeat superior liability\n\nfor the conduct of the pilots, which emphasizes the lack of control\n\nover the work of the pilot.         Consistent with the fact that pilots\n\nact independently according to their own professional judgment in\n\npiloting a vessel, pilots remain personally liable for their own\n\nnegligence.    See McKeithen, supra.           Further, the associations’\n\ncharters    specifically     state    that    the     associations   are     not\n\nresponsible for debts or faults of their members.            This factor also\n\nweighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.\n\n     We    conclude   that    the    EEOC’s    six     factors,   though     not\n\nnecessarily exhaustive, are decisive here.                Each factor weighs\n\nagainst finding that the pilot is an employee of the association.\n\nThe associations obviously are the most important and determinative\n\nfactor in the work life of a pilot; yet the elements of employer\n\ncontrol over an employee fail to describe the character of the\n\npower that the associations exercise.              It is certainly true that\n\n                                      20\n\fthe associations, along with the NOBRA and Crescent Boards and the\n\ngovernor,     play     an      almost     monopolistic               gate-keeper      role    in\n\ndetermining who will ultimately work as a river pilot; it is also\n\ntrue that the associations (through their members) set rules and\n\nregulations directly affecting the daily work of each pilot.\n\nNevertheless,        if        Clackamas        is        our        guide,     the    central\n\ncharacteristics of employer control over the pilot are lacking.\n\nThe   associations        do     not    hire       or    fire    pilots,      nor     can    they\n\ndecommission them; they do not supervise the pilots in their work;\n\nand   their     charters          create       relationships             that       cannot    be\n\ncharacterized as employee/employer.                        The pilots do their work\n\nindependently according to their own professional judgment; they\n\nhave ultimate control over the associations’ rules and regulations\n\nthat bind them; and they retain personal liability for their own\n\nnegligence,     with        no    vicarious             liability       attaching      to    the\n\nassociations.        Until the United States Supreme Court adopts a\n\nwholly different analytical approach from the one provided by\n\nClackamas, we think it clear that the pilots are not employees of\n\nthe associations.           It follows that neither of the associations,\n\nwith fewer     than       twenty       employees,         is    an    employer    within     the\n\ndefinition of the ADEA.\n\n      Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in\n\ngranting NOBRA and Crescent summary judgment.\n\n                                               B\n\n      Coleman does not assert that the Crescent Board itself is an\n\n                                               21\n\f“employer.”    See Camacho v. Puerto Rico Ports Authority, 369 F.3d\n\n570 (1st Cir. 2004).       Instead, Coleman argues that the Crescent\n\nBoard is a joint employer with Crescent.          Because we hold that\n\nCrescent is not an employer of pilots under the ADEA, it follows\n\nthat the Crescent Board cannot be a joint employer with Crescent.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in\n\ngranting summary judgment to the Crescent Board because it is not\n\nan employer under the meaning of the ADEA.\n\n                                      IV\n\n     Based     on   the   foregoing    considerations,   which   are,   of\n\nnecessity, narrowly bound to the unique qualities of the pilots’\n\nassociations presented here, the District Court’s grants of summary\n\njudgment are\n\n                                                                 AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      22\n\f",

The defendant associations are long-standing, peculiarly conducted institutions recognized by statute, owned and governed by their member pilots, and serving as a sort of clearinghouse and dispatching service for the river pilots. There is no doubt that if the plaintiff suffered age discrimination, it was administered by the hands of the defendant associations because of their age-restrictive policies. Yet, there is an absence of any traditional employer relationship, traditional independent-contractor relationship, hiring-hall relationship, or employment-agency relationship between the associations and the pilots.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Terry Coleman (\"Coleman\"), born October 1, 1951, brought suit against the New Orleans &amp; Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association (\"NOBRA\") and the Crescent River Port Pilot's Association (\"Crescent\"), as well as the Board of River Port Pilot Commissioners (the \"Crescent Board\"), alleging that these entities unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his age in violation of the ADEA. They did so, he claims, by refusing to elect him into their respective pilot apprenticeship programs because he was too old under their membership qualifications. The District Court granted summary judgment in these separately filed actions to NOBRA, Crescent, and the Crescent Board, holding that these entities are not \"employers\" within the meaning of the ADEA and therefore cannot be held liable under the ADEA. Because both cases present similar legal issues, we consider them together in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that NOBRA, Crescent, and the Crescent Board are not \"employers\" of river pilots within the meaning of the ADEA. These entities are therefore not subject to the ADEA's prohibitions on age discrimination in employment. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court's grants of summary judgment to NOBRA, Crescent, and the Crescent Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In our effort to determine whether any of the defendants meet the definition of \"employer\" under the ADEA, we must first understand Louisiana's body of rules and regulations governing the licensing of Mississippi River pilots and the relationship among pilots, boards of examiners, and pilots' associations in the operation of the pilot apprenticeship programs. Only then can we fully understand the organizational structure of the defendant pilots' associations and its bearing on the question of liability under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Louisiana state law requires that local pilots guide foreign ships along Louisiana waterways, including the Mississippi River.

Because apprenticeships must be completed under the supervision of a commissioned pilot, and because only a limited number of pilots are allowed by law, certification by the board as a qualified candidate does not guarantee an individual a place in the apprenticeship program. The individual must then be elected to apprenticeship by a majority vote of the pilots' association for the respective stretch of the river.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once elected, the candidate completes a board-certified apprenticeship program under the supervision of commissioned pilots.

Upon completion of the apprenticeship program, the boards examine the apprentices as to their knowledge of pilotage and their proficiency and capability to serve as commissioned pilots. LA. ADMIN. CODE tit. 46, &#167; 6107(M)(2) (2003). If the board deems the apprentice qualified, the board certifies the apprentice to the Governor for commissioning.

NOBRA moved for summary judgment asserting that it is not an \"employer\" under the ADEA. The District Court granted NOBRA summary judgment, finding that Coleman did not present a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether NOBRA is an \"employer\" of river pilots within the meaning of the ADEA. <i>Coleman v. New Orleans Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association,</i> 2004 WL 1237447 (E.D.La. June 1, 2004). The District Court summarily adopted the reasoning of <i>Ehret v. State of Louisiana,</i> 862 F.Supp. 1546 (E.D.La.1992), a case holding that Crescent lacked control over its member pilots and therefore was not their employer. <i>Ehret,</i> in turn, had found persuasive the analysis in the tort case <i>McKeithen v. The SS FROSTA,</i> 441 F.Supp. 1213 (E.D.La.1977), which held that NOBRA was not vicariously liable as an employer because it exerted no control over a pilot once he took the helm of a vessel. <i>McKeithen</i> likened NOBRA to other professional associations and found NOBRA pilots to be independent contractors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coleman also received right-to-sue letters from the EEOC for his charges against Crescent and the Crescent Board. Coleman then filed separate actions alleging violations of the ADEA against Crescent and the Crescent Board, which were consolidated before the District Court. Crescent and the Crescent Board both moved for summary judgment arguing in part that they are not \"employers\" or \"joint employers.\" Relying on the same reasoning as the opinion in the NOBRA proceeding, the District Court granted Crescent and the Crescent Board summary judgment. <i>Coleman v.

Although the prohibitions of the ADEA are broad in scope, the reach of the ADEA is limited by the statute's own definitions of \"employer,\" \"employment agency,\" and \"labor organization.\" <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630. If an entity is not an employer, employment agency, or labor organization, it is not subject to the prohibitions of the ADEA against age discrimination in employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question that confronts us is whether Crescent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and NOBRA are entities that are subject to the prohibitions of the ADEA. The answer to this question is not immediately apparent. We begin by considering each possibility of coverage under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>(2)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first observe that NOBRA and Crescent cannot be considered \"employment agencies\" or \"labor organizations\" under the ADEA. Coleman has not made such an assertion, but at first glance, NOBRA and Crescent share characteristics with employment agencies and labor organizations as they are commonly understood. The dispatching function of the associations, matching pilots with vessels needing piloting, may be analogized in a general way to the usual purpose of an employment agency or union hiring hall. However, we must deal specifically with the definitions in the ADEA. NOBRA and Crescent are not labor organizations because they do not exist for the \"purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(d). Although the ADEA refers to hiring halls, its reference is only to explain that a labor organization is \"deemed to be in an industry affecting commerce if (1) it maintains or operates a hiring hall or hiring office which procures employees for an employer or procures for employees opportunities to work for an employer....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, labor organizations interact with the <i>employer</i> of the members of the organization. A shipowner or charterer is not the hired pilot's employer in the sense relevant here, for it exercises no control over the pilot's navigation of the vessel. We can find no argument or authority for deeming pilots anything other than independent contractors of the vessels they are hired to navigate. Thus, this term \"employer\" prevents our finding that NOBRA and Crescent are employment agencies, which are defined as \"any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure employees for an <i>employer</i> and includes an agent of such person....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the functional similarities between the associations and labor organization/employment agencies, because of the ADEA definitions of the two types of entities, we are left to consider only whether NOBRA and Crescent are <i>employers</i> of their member pilots. The ADEA defines an \"employer\" as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(b). This definition, however, provides little guidance in determining whether a particular entity is in fact an employer; the statute simply defines \"employee\" as \"an individual employed by any employer....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circular language defining \"employer\" at least states clearly that an entity must employ twenty or more employees to satisfy the ADEA definition of employer. Whether Crescent or NOBRA has more than twenty employees depends entirely on whether the pilots are considered to be employees of the associations. We are thus left with the sole question whether the pilots are the associations' employees, a term not substantively defined by the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>(3)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have come all this way to arrive at the point suggested by the previous cases and indeed by the District Court: the touchstone of our analysis centers around the common-law notion of control of the individual. Our approach to the question of control takes a somewhat different path, however. In <i>Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P.C. v. Wells,</i> 538 U.S. 440, 123 S.Ct. 1673, 155 L.Ed.2d 615 (2003), the Supreme Court approved the EEOC's gloss on the control standard in questioning whether a partner, officer, major shareholder, or director qualifies as an employee. Given the relationship between the pilots and the associations, which we have earlier described in detail, we find such an analysis specifically appropriate. The EEOC framed the issue as \"whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the organization, or whether the individual is subject to the organization's control.\" <i>Id.</i> at 448, 123 S.Ct. 1673 (internal citation omitted). The Court specifically embraced the EEOC's proposed six factors relevant to determining whether a shareholder/director is an employee of the organization:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Whether the organization can hire or fire the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individual's work</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Whether, and if so, to what extent the organization supervises the individual's work</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Whether the individual reports to someone higher in the organization</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Whether, and if so, to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Whether the parties intended that the individual be an employee, as expressed in written agreements or contracts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) Whether the individual shares in the profits, losses, and liabilities of the organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 449-50, 123 S.Ct. 1673. We now apply these Supreme Court/EEOC factors to the pilots' relationship to the defendant associations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first factor we consider is whether the pilots' associations hire and fire the member pilots. Despite Coleman's arguments to the contrary, they do not. Certainly, the pilots' associations do have the power to elect apprentices and to admit pilots into their membership. The associations, however, do not have the power to grant commissions that permit the pilot to work in the profession; pilots receive their commissions from the Governor, and the associations cannot decommission a pilot. With respect to the actual job performed &#8212; piloting &#8212; the role of the associations is essentially that of dispatching pilots to the ships needing them; the vessel engages the pilot and the master of the vessel can refuse the services of a particular pilot. This first factor weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third factors ask whether the pilots' associations supervise the individual pilot's work and whether the pilot reports to someone \"higher\" in the association. As noted earlier, the primary business of the associations is to receive requests for pilotage, dispatch pilots to the vessels, and collect and disburse pilotage fees. The associations do not supervise the pilots in their work, nor is there a chain of command in the performance of their work &#8212; the individual pilot gives navigation advice independently according to his own professional judgment. These two factors therefore weigh against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth factor asks to what extent the pilots are able to influence the pilots' associations. Pilots constitute the entire body of shareholders of their respective associations. Each pilot holds an equal share and participates in the election of directors of the association and in shareholder-approval votes. Thus, the pilots exert substantial influence over the general management of the association as well as the promulgation of association rules and regulations specifically. This factor, too, weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth factor asks whether the parties intended that the individual pilot be an employee. Clearly not. Each of the charters of NOBRA and Crescent makes unequivocal that no employment relationship is intended; these charters expressly define the relationship between the pilots and the association as an association for the mutual benefit of the member pilots. This factor also weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sixth factor asks whether the pilots share in the profits, losses, and liabilities of the association. Pilots share in the \"profits\" of the association (and the \"losses\" if times are not good) by receiving a share of collected fees according to a set formula agreed upon by the shareholder pilots themselves. At the same time, the associations have no <i>respondeat superior</i> liability for the conduct of the pilots, which emphasizes the lack of control over the work of the pilot. Consistent with the fact that pilots act independently according to their own professional judgment in piloting a vessel, pilots remain personally liable for their own negligence. <i>See McKeithen, supra.</i> Further, the associations' charters specifically state that the associations are not responsible for debts or faults of their members. This factor also weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the EEOC's six factors, though not necessarily exhaustive, are decisive here. Each factor weighs against finding that the pilot is an employee of the association. The associations obviously are the most important and determinative factor in the work life of a pilot; yet the elements of employer control over an employee fail to describe the character of the power that the associations exercise. It is certainly true that the associations, along with the NOBRA and Crescent Boards and the governor, play an almost monopolistic gate-keeper role in determining who will ultimately work as a river pilot; it is also true that the associations (through their members) set rules and regulations directly affecting the daily work of each pilot. Nevertheless, if <i>Clackamas</i> is our guide, the central characteristics of employer control over the pilot are lacking. The associations do not hire or fire pilots, nor can they decommission them; they do not supervise the pilots in their work; and their charters create relationships that cannot be characterized as employee/employer. The pilots do their work independently according to their own professional judgment; they have ultimate control over the associations' rules and regulations that bind them; and they retain personal liability for their own negligence, with no vicarious liability attaching to the associations. Until the United States Supreme Court adopts a wholly different analytical approach from the one provided by <i>Clackamas,</i> we think it clear that the pilots are not employees of the associations. It follows that neither of the associations, with fewer than twenty employees, is an employer within the definition of the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting NOBRA and Crescent summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coleman does not assert that the Crescent Board itself is an \"employer.\" <i>See Camacho v. Puerto Rico Ports Authority,</i> 369 F.3d 570 (1st Cir.2004). Instead, Coleman argues that the Crescent Board is a joint employer with Crescent. Because we hold that Crescent is not an employer of pilots under the ADEA, it follows that the Crescent Board cannot be a joint employer with Crescent. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Crescent Board because it is not an employer under the meaning of the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing considerations, which are, of necessity, narrowly bound to the unique qualities of the pilots' associations presented here, the District Court's grants of summary judgment are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Bar pilots and their association are not at issue in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This exact process does not appear to be mandated by statute, but rather the result of the regulations promulgated by the boards of commissioners/examiners and the respective pilots' association for the particular stretch of the river</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The NOBRA Board's regulations provide that an applicant \"must have been duly elected an apprentice in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association as per Association rules in effect as of such application.\" LA. ADMIN. CODE tit. 46, &#167; 6107 (2003). The legal source of this voting process for the Crescent Board and Crescent is unclear. We have found nothing in the law requiring only so many individuals be apprenticed as there are open seats, although this does make practical sense. Similarly, we have found nothing in the law requiring that the association elect apprentices by majority vote, although the fact that, as a practical matter, all pilots are association members makes this process sensible and efficient. What is clear, however, is that this process is long-standing and a matter of tradition for the pilots<i>See generally Kotch v.

These facts, however, are not relevant to the question whether these entities are \"employers\", but rather are relevant only to the establishment of a<i>prima facie</i> case of age discrimination and the subsequent <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> analysis. <i>See generally McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <i>Machinchick v. PB Power, Inc.,</i> 398 F.3d 345, 349-53 (5th Cir.2005).

Coleman asserts that <i>Ehret</i> is no longer controlling law because the post-<i>Ehret</i> promulgation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.21 clarified that NOBRA and Crescent are employers at least with respect to the apprenticeship program. Coleman notes that the EEOC specifically referred to 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.21 in finding that cause existed to believe that Coleman was discriminated against because of his age. Coleman also notes that courts have allowed plaintiff's to proceed against operators of similar apprenticeship programs for violations of the ADEA. <i>See EEOC v. Joint Apprenticeship Committee,</i> 186 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We think Coleman misreads the scope of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.21. We agree with the District Court that the regulation \"expands the coverage of the ADEA to applicants for apprenticeship programs, but does not expand the classes of persons liable pursuant to the ADEA as set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623.\" <i>Coleman v. New Orleans Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Ass'n,</i> 2004 WL 1237447, at *3 (E.D.La. June 1, 2004). Section 1625.21 did not alter 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.1, which provides that \"the terms person, employer, employment agency, labor organization, and employee shall have the meanings set forth in &#167; 11 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 621 <i>et seq</i>.....\" The regulation itself makes clear that it does not expand liability beyond \"employers\" by specifically referencing the \"prohibitions of Section IV of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623.\" The Second Circuit's decision in <i>Joint Apprenticeship Committee</i> is not to the contrary because it simply assumed that an employer-employee relationship existed. 186 F.3d at 115.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The defendant associations are long-standing, peculiarly conducted institutions recognized by statute, owned and governed by their member pilots, and serving as a sort of clearinghouse and dispatching service for the river pilots. There is no doubt that if the plaintiff suffered age discrimination, it was administered by the hands of the defendant associations because of their age-restrictive policies. Yet, there is an absence of any traditional employer relationship, traditional independent-contractor relationship, hiring-hall relationship, or employment-agency relationship between the associations and the pilots.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Terry Coleman (\"Coleman\"), born October 1, 1951, brought suit against the New Orleans &amp; Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association (\"NOBRA\") and the Crescent River Port Pilot's Association (\"Crescent\"), as well as the Board of River Port Pilot Commissioners (the \"Crescent Board\"), alleging that these entities unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his age in violation of the ADEA. They did so, he claims, by refusing to elect him into their respective pilot apprenticeship programs because he was too old under their membership qualifications. The District Court granted summary judgment in these separately filed actions to NOBRA, Crescent, and the Crescent Board, holding that these entities are not \"employers\" within the meaning of the ADEA and therefore cannot be held liable under the ADEA. Because both cases present similar legal issues, we consider them together in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that NOBRA, Crescent, and the Crescent Board are not \"employers\" of river pilots within the meaning of the ADEA.

The District Court granted NOBRA summary judgment, finding that Coleman did not present a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether NOBRA is an \"employer\" of river pilots within the meaning of the ADEA. <i>Coleman v.

Although the prohibitions of the ADEA are broad in scope, the reach of the ADEA is limited by the statute's own definitions of \"employer,\" \"employment agency,\" and \"labor organization.\" <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630. If an entity is not an employer, employment agency, or labor organization, it is not subject to the prohibitions of the ADEA against age discrimination in employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question that confronts us is whether Crescent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and NOBRA are entities that are subject to the prohibitions of the ADEA. The answer to this question is not immediately apparent. We begin by considering each possibility of coverage under the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>(2)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first observe that NOBRA and Crescent cannot be considered \"employment agencies\" or \"labor organizations\" under the ADEA. Coleman has not made such an assertion, but at first glance, NOBRA and Crescent share characteristics with employment agencies and labor organizations as they are commonly understood. The dispatching function of the associations, matching pilots with vessels needing piloting, may be analogized in a general way to the usual purpose of an employment agency or union hiring hall. However, we must deal specifically with the definitions in the ADEA. NOBRA and Crescent are not labor organizations because they do not exist for the \"purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(d). Although the ADEA refers to hiring halls, its reference is only to explain that a labor organization is \"deemed to be in an industry affecting commerce if (1) it maintains or operates a hiring hall or hiring office which procures employees for an employer or procures for employees opportunities to work for an employer....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, labor organizations interact with the <i>employer</i> of the members of the organization. A shipowner or charterer is not the hired pilot's employer in the sense relevant here, for it exercises no control over the pilot's navigation of the vessel. We can find no argument or authority for deeming pilots anything other than independent contractors of the vessels they are hired to navigate. Thus, this term \"employer\" prevents our finding that NOBRA and Crescent are employment agencies, which are defined as \"any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure employees for an <i>employer</i> and includes an agent of such person....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the functional similarities between the associations and labor organization/employment agencies, because of the ADEA definitions of the two types of entities, we are left to consider only whether NOBRA and Crescent are <i>employers</i> of their member pilots. The ADEA defines an \"employer\" as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(b). This definition, however, provides little guidance in determining whether a particular entity is in fact an employer; the statute simply defines \"employee\" as \"an individual employed by any employer....\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 630(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circular language defining \"employer\" at least states clearly that an entity must employ twenty or more employees to satisfy the ADEA definition of employer. Whether Crescent or NOBRA has more than twenty employees depends entirely on whether the pilots are considered to be employees of the associations. We are thus left with the sole question whether the pilots are the associations' employees, a term not substantively defined by the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>(3)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have come all this way to arrive at the point suggested by the previous cases and indeed by the District Court: the touchstone of our analysis centers around the common-law notion of control of the individual. Our approach to the question of control takes a somewhat different path, however. In <i>Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P.C. v. Wells,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127911\"><a href=\"/opinion/127911/clackamas-gastroenterology-associates-pc-v-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127911\"><a href=\"/opinion/127911/clackamas-gastroenterology-associates-pc-v-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span> (2003), the Supreme Court approved the EEOC's gloss on the control standard in questioning whether a partner, officer, major shareholder, or director qualifies as an employee. Given the relationship between the pilots and the associations, which we have earlier described in detail, we find such an analysis specifically appropriate. The EEOC framed the issue as \"whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the organization, or whether the individual is subject to the organization's control.\" <i>Id.</i> at 448, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127911\"><a href=\"/opinion/127911/clackamas-gastroenterology-associates-pc-v-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span>. We now apply these Supreme Court/EEOC factors to the pilots' relationship to the defendant associations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first factor we consider is whether the pilots' associations hire and fire the member pilots. Despite Coleman's arguments to the contrary, they do not. Certainly, the pilots' associations do have the power to elect apprentices and to admit pilots into their membership. The associations, however, do not have the power to grant commissions that permit the pilot to work in the profession; pilots receive their commissions from the Governor, and the associations cannot decommission a pilot. With respect to the actual job performed &#8212; piloting &#8212; the role of the associations is essentially that of dispatching pilots to the ships needing them; the vessel engages the pilot and the master of the vessel can refuse the services of a particular pilot. This first factor weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third factors ask whether the pilots' associations supervise the individual pilot's work and whether the pilot reports to someone \"higher\" in the association. As noted earlier, the primary business of the associations is to receive requests for pilotage, dispatch pilots to the vessels, and collect and disburse pilotage fees. The associations do not supervise the pilots in their work, nor is there a chain of command in the performance of their work &#8212; the individual pilot gives navigation advice independently according to his own professional judgment. These two factors therefore weigh against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth factor asks to what extent the pilots are able to influence the pilots' associations. Pilots constitute the entire body of shareholders of their respective associations. Each pilot holds an equal share and participates in the election of directors of the association and in shareholder-approval votes. Thus, the pilots exert substantial influence over the general management of the association as well as the promulgation of association rules and regulations specifically. This factor, too, weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth factor asks whether the parties intended that the individual pilot be an employee. Clearly not. Each of the charters of NOBRA and Crescent makes unequivocal that no employment relationship is intended; these charters expressly define the relationship between the pilots and the association as an association for the mutual benefit of the member pilots. This factor also weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sixth factor asks whether the pilots share in the profits, losses, and liabilities of the association. Pilots share in the \"profits\" of the association (and the \"losses\" if times are not good) by receiving a share of collected fees according to a set formula agreed upon by the shareholder pilots themselves. At the same time, the associations have no <i>respondeat superior</i> liability for the conduct of the pilots, which emphasizes the lack of control over the work of the pilot. Consistent with the fact that pilots act independently according to their own professional judgment in piloting a vessel, pilots remain personally liable for their own negligence. <i>See McKeithen, supra.</i> Further, the associations' charters specifically state that the associations are not responsible for debts or faults of their members. This factor also weighs against labeling the pilots ADEA employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the EEOC's six factors, though not necessarily exhaustive, are decisive here. Each factor weighs against finding that the pilot is an employee of the association. The associations obviously are the most important and determinative factor in the work life of a pilot; yet the elements of employer control over an employee fail to describe the character of the power that the associations exercise. It is certainly true that the associations, along with the NOBRA and Crescent Boards and the governor, play an almost monopolistic gate-keeper role in determining who will ultimately work as a river pilot; it is also true that the associations (through their members) set rules and regulations directly affecting the daily work of each pilot. Nevertheless, if <i>Clackamas</i> is our guide, the central characteristics of employer control over the pilot are lacking. The associations do not hire or fire pilots, nor can they decommission them; they do not supervise the pilots in their work; and their charters create relationships that cannot be characterized as employee/employer. The pilots do their work independently according to their own professional judgment; they have ultimate control over the associations' rules and regulations that bind them; and they retain personal liability for their own negligence, with no vicarious liability attaching to the associations. Until the United States Supreme Court adopts a wholly different analytical approach from the one provided by <i>Clackamas,</i> we think it clear that the pilots are not employees of the associations. It follows that neither of the associations, with fewer than twenty employees, is an employer within the definition of the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting NOBRA and Crescent summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coleman does not assert that the Crescent Board itself is an \"employer.\" <i>See Camacho v. Puerto Rico Ports Authority,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201027\"><a href=\"/opinion/201027/camacho-v-puerto-rico-ports/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004). Instead, Coleman argues that the Crescent Board is a joint employer with Crescent. Because we hold that Crescent is not an employer of pilots under the ADEA, it follows that the Crescent Board cannot be a joint employer with Crescent. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Crescent Board because it is not an employer under the meaning of the ADEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing considerations, which are, of necessity, narrowly bound to the unique qualities of the pilots' associations presented here, the District Court's grants of summary judgment are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Bar pilots and their association are not at issue in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This exact process does not appear to be mandated by statute, but rather the result of the regulations promulgated by the boards of commissioners/examiners and the respective pilots' association for the particular stretch of the river</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The NOBRA Board's regulations provide that an applicant \"must have been duly elected an apprentice in the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association as per Association rules in effect as of such application.\" LA. ADMIN. CODE tit. 46, &#167; 6107 (2003). The legal source of this voting process for the Crescent Board and Crescent is unclear. We have found nothing in the law requiring only so many individuals be apprenticed as there are open seats, although this does make practical sense. Similarly, we have found nothing in the law requiring that the association elect apprentices by majority vote, although the fact that, as a practical matter, all pilots are association members makes this process sensible and efficient. What is clear, however, is that this process is long-standing and a matter of tradition for the pilots<i>See generally Kotch v.

Coleman asserts that <i>Ehret</i> is no longer controlling law because the post-<i>Ehret</i> promulgation of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.21 clarified that NOBRA and Crescent are employers at least with respect to the apprenticeship program. Coleman notes that the EEOC specifically referred to 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.21 in finding that cause existed to believe that Coleman was discriminated against because of his age. Coleman also notes that courts have allowed plaintiff's to proceed against operators of similar apprenticeship programs for violations of the ADEA. <i>See EEOC v. Joint Apprenticeship Committee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765478\"><a href=\"/opinion/765478/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-plaintiff-appellant-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We think Coleman misreads the scope of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.21. We agree with the District Court that the regulation \"expands the coverage of the ADEA to applicants for apprenticeship programs, but does not expand the classes of persons liable pursuant to the ADEA as set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623.\" <i>Coleman v.

June 1, 2004). Section 1625.21 did not alter 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1625.1, which provides that \"the terms person, employer, employment agency, labor organization, and employee shall have the meanings set forth in &#167; 11 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 621 <i>et seq</i>.....\" The regulation itself makes clear that it does not expand liability beyond \"employers\" by specifically referencing the \"prohibitions of Section IV of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623.\" The Second Circuit's decision in <i>Joint Apprenticeship Committee</i> is not to the contrary because it simply assumed that an employer-employee relationship existed. 186 F.3d at 115.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
