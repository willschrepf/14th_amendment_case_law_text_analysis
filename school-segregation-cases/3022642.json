          "plain_text": "                               UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                               FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n RYAN BAGWELL,\n\n                        Plaintiff,\n\n                        v.                          Case No. 15-cv-00531 (CRC)\n\n UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n JUSTICE,\n                Defendant.\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\n       Plaintiff Ryan Bagwell, a Pennsylvania State University alumnus, seeks to uncover public\n\nrecords related to the University’s role in the child-sex-abuse scandal surrounding its former\n\nassistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. Compl. ¶ 3. On April 30, 2014, Bagwell lodged a\n\nFreedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request with the Executive Office for United States\n\nAttorneys (“EOUSA”), requesting “access to any and all records of investigations between\n\nNovember 1, 2011 and [April 30, 2014] that pertain to allegations of child sexual abuse that\n\noccurred on the campus of The Pennsylvania State University.” Id. ¶ 5. Bagwell’s interest in these\n\nparticular records stems from a now-closed federal criminal investigation of the Sandusky matter\n\nand an independent investigation into the school’s handling of it conducted by former FBI Director\n\nLouis J. Freeh and his law firm. Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1–2.\n\n       After some back-and-forth involving Bagwell, EOUSA’s FOIA/Privacy Act office, and\n\nDOJ’s Office of Information Policy (“OIP”), EOUSA provided Bagwell with a final response to his\n\nFOIA request on July 8, 2015, several months after Bagwell filed this action. It released 517 pages\n\nof records and withheld 104 pages in full. Id. at 4. It also withheld over 2,700 pages of records and\n\n86 gigabytes of electronic information that it never reviewed but instead categorically labeled\n\n“grand jury information” or “grand jury material.” Id.; Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 8–9.\n\fDOJ has now moved for summary judgment, contending that it has produced all of the responsive\n\nrecords to which Bagwell is entitled, and Bagwell has cross-moved for summary judgment,\n\ncontending that DOJ has not met its burden to show that the withheld records are exempt from\n\nFOIA’s disclosure requirements. Because the Court cannot determine—based on the declarations\n\nand Vaughn Index provided by DOJ—whether the search for responsive records was adequate or to\n\nwhat degree any FOIA exemptions shield the withheld documents from disclosure, it will defer\n\nresolution of the motions to allow DOJ an opportunity to supplement its documentation.\n\n       I.      Standard of Review\n\n       Congress passed FOIA “to pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency\n\naction to the light of public scrutiny.” Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 655 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The statute imposes a general obligation on the government to provide\n\nrecords to the public. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a). Although FOIA provides for exceptions to this general\n\nobligation to disclose, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b), “[t]he basic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an informed\n\ncitizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check against corruption and to\n\nhold the governors accountable to the governed,” NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S.\n\n214, 242 (1978). Thus, FOIA “‘exemptions are explicitly made exclusive,’” Milner v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011) (citing EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 79 (1973)), and they “must be\n\n‘narrowly construed,’” id. (citing FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982)).\n\n       FOIA cases are appropriately decided on cross-motions for summary judgment. See\n\nBrayton v. Office of U.S. Trade Rep., 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011). In deciding a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the Court assumes the truth of the non-movant’s evidence and draws all\n\nreasonable inferences in the non-movant’s favor. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n\n242, 255 (1986). The government bears the burden to establish that its claimed exemptions apply to\n\neach document for which it invokes an exemption. Am. Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\n                                                  2\n\fDef., 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The government cannot satisfy this burden with\n\naffidavits that are vague or conclusory, or merely parrot the statutory standard. Consumer Fed’n of\n\nAm. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 455 F.3d 283, 287 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The declarations must describe\n\nthe justifications for withholding in “specific detail, demonstrat[ing] that the information withheld\n\nlogically falls within the claimed exemption.” Am. Civil Liberties Union, 628 F.3d at 619. “When\n\ndemonstrating that a FOIA exemption applies to some portion of a document withheld, the agency\n\nmust also provide a detailed justification for its non-segregability,” Johnson v. Exec. Office for U.S.\n\nAttorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (emphasis added), and the agency should “describe\n\nwhat portion of the information is non-exempt and how that material is dispersed throughout the\n\ndocument,” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\n\n       II.     Analysis\n\n       Both parties’ motions for summary judgment revolve around four main issues: (1) whether\n\nDOJ’s search for responsive records was adequate; (2) whether DOJ is operating under the correct\n\nlegal standard for withholding “grand jury material”; (3) whether DOJ’s Vaughn Index is adequate;\n\nand (4) whether DOJ has satisfied its segregability obligations. The Court will discuss each in turn.\n\n               A.      Adequacy of the Search\n\n       The Court cannot conclude, based on the record before it, that DOJ’s search for responsive\n\nrecords was adequate. “[A]n agency responding to a FOIA request must ‘conduct[] a search\n\nreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents,’ and, if challenged, must demonstrate\n\n‘beyond material doubt’ that the search was reasonable.” Truitt v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 897 F.2d\n\n540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (alteration in original) (quoting Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 705\n\nF.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). “‘The issue is not whether any further documents might\n\nconceivably exist but rather whether the government’s search for responsive documents was\n\nadequate.’ The adequacy of an agency’s search is measured by a ‘standard of reasonableness,’ and\n\n                                                   3\n\fis ‘dependent upon the circumstances of the case.’” Id. (quoting Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351). “If,\n\nhowever, the record leaves substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the search, summary judgment\n\nfor the agency is not proper.” Id. Furthermore, “[i]n order to establish the adequacy of a search,\n\nagency affidavits must be . . . ‘relatively detailed and non-conclusory, and . . . submitted in good\n\nfaith.’” SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (quoting Ground\n\nSaucer Watch, Inc. v. CIA, 692 F.2d 770, 771 (D.C. Cir. 1981)). These “affidavits are accorded a\n\npresumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by ‘purely speculative claims about the\n\nexistence and discoverability of other documents.’” Id. (quoting SafeCard Servs., 926 at 1200).\n\n       At present, DOJ has failed to demonstrate beyond material doubt that it has conducted a\n\nsearch reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. First, the FOIA contact person for\n\nthe United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (“USAO/MDPA”)\n\nattests to having searched “all systems of records located within the USAO/MDPA that were likely\n\nto contain responsive records to Plaintiff’s request,” Decl. of Jodi Matuszewski ¶ 15, but does not\n\nindicate whether this search included the office’s email system. Clearly, DOJ considered certain\n\nemails to be responsive to Bagwell’s request, as it acknowledged in its Vaughn Index that it\n\nwithheld some “email conversations among Assistant United States Attorneys.” Vaughn Index –\n\nEOUSA, ECF No. 12-5. The Court has no way of knowing, however, the method by which DOJ\n\nsearched for and located those particular emails and thus cannot determine whether the search was\n\nlikely to have captured all responsive emails. Second, the Court’s confusion over the status of any\n\nemail search is heightened by the public remarks of former FBI Director Freeh, who conducted the\n\nindependent investigation into the Sandusky matter “in parallel with several other active\n\ninvestigations by agencies and governmental authorities, including the . . . United States Attorney\n\n[for the Middle District of Pennsylvania].” Remarks of Louis Freeh, July 12, 2012, ECF No. 13-8.\n\nMr. Freeh stated that he “continuously interfaced and cooperated with those agencies and\n\n                                                   4\n\fauthorities,” id., which at least suggests that a record of communication may exist between his firm\n\nand USAO/MDPA regarding the investigation. While “an agency’s failure to find a particular\n\ndocument does not necessarily indicate that its search was inadequate,” North v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 774 F. Supp. 2d 217, 222 (D.D.C. 2011), in this instance the search’s apparent failure to\n\nuncover any material along these lines raises a legitimate question as to thoroughness of the search.\n\nThe current record thus leaves the Court in substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of DOJ’s search.\n\n               B.      Grand Jury Material\n\n       DOJ has also failed adequately to justify its invocation of FOIA Exemption (b)(3),\n\nspecifically as it relates to what DOJ labels “grand jury material.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ.\n\nJ. 9. This exemption “permits an agency to withhold material ‘specifically exempted from\n\ndisclosure by statute . . . provided that such statute [requires withholding] in such a manner as to\n\nleave no discretion on the issue.’ 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3).” Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico on Behalf of Judiciary Comm. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 823 F.2d 574, 582 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\nAs relevant here, “[t]he Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in turn, prohibit . . . disclosure of\n\n‘matters occurring before [a] grand jury.’ Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2). Relying on the incorporation of\n\nRule 6(e) within exemption (b)(3),” id., DOJ here contends that “grand jury material is categorically\n\nexempt,” and claims that “it is the customary practice of EOUSA when it receives requests for ‘all\n\nrecords’ as in this case, to inform the USAO to respond with all responsive records except for\n\nmaterials related to the grand jury, which are exempt as a matter of law.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot.\n\nSumm. J. 9. Not all material that relates to a grand jury, however, is exempt as a matter of law.\n\n       The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has held that “[t]here is no per se rule against\n\ndisclosure of any and all information which has reached the grand jury chambers.” Rather,\n\n       [t]he touchstone is whether disclosure would tend to reveal some secret aspect of the\n       grand jury’s investigation[—]such matters as the identities of witnesses or jurors, the\n       substance of testimony, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the deliberations\n\n                                                   5\n\f       or questions of jurors, and the like. The disclosure of information coincidentally\n       before the grand jury [which can] be revealed in such a manner that its revelation\n       would not elucidate the inner workings of the grand jury is not prohibited.\n\nSenate of Puerto Rico, 823 F.2d at 582 (internal quotation marks omitted). This approach makes\n\nsense from a policy perspective as well: “Automatically sealing all that a grand jury sees or hears\n\nwould enable the government to shield any information from public view indefinitely by the simple\n\nexpedient of presenting it to the grand jury.” Id.\n\n       This Court “recognize[s] the importance of maintaining the secrecy of grand jury\n\nproceedings, and acknowledge[s] the ‘necessarily broad’ scope of Rule 6(e).” Id. at 584 (quoting\n\nFund for Constitutional Gov’t v. Nat’l Archives & Records Serv., 656 F.2d 856, 866 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1981)). And “[i]t may turn out, in this case, that most, or even all, of the material withheld pursuant\n\nto exemption (b)(3) cannot be disclosed without compromising the secrecy of a grand jury’s\n\ndeliberations.” Id. But as in Senate of Puerto Rico, DOJ has “not yet supplied the information a\n\ncourt must have in order to intelligently make that judgment.” Id. DOJ does provide some\n\ninformation on this front, but not enough. For instance, it asserts that it “invoked Exemption 3 to\n\nwithhold names of grand jury witnesses,” correctly observing that “Exemption 3 applies to the\n\nidentities of” those witnesses. Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 9. It also implies that it withheld\n\na draft indictment, which “is most assuredly a document that reveals the strategy and direction of a\n\ngrand jury investigation.” Id. Without any additional specificity as to what documents and files it\n\nwithheld, however, DOJ has not demonstrated—and the Court cannot determine—that all 2,700\n\npages and 86 gigabytes of withheld material would reveal some secret aspect of the grand jury’s\n\nproceedings or deliberations. The Court is further troubled by the possibility that no review was\n\never conducted of the “records related to the grand jury proceedings” in the first place.\n\nMatuszewski Decl. ¶ 14. Without such a review, it is unclear how EOUSA could determine that the\n\nexemption applies, let alone “suppl[y] the information a court must have in order to intelligently\n\n                                                     6\n\fmake [the] judgment” that the material it withheld would reveal some secret aspect of the grand\n\njury’s inner workings or investigation. Senate of Puerto Rico, 823 F.2d at 584.\n\n       Under Senate of Puerto Rico, it is insufficient for an agency to withhold documents merely\n\nbecause those documents had been the subject of a subpoena or at some point were before a grand\n\njury. Id. “[U]nless” the fact that “material has been presented to the grand jury . . . automatically\n\nexempts the material [from disclosure], a position [the D.C. Circuit] reject[s], it is incumbent upon\n\n[a court] to require some affirmative demonstration of a nexus between disclosure and revelation of\n\na protected aspect of the grand jury’s investigation.” Id. Unless and until DOJ makes that\n\naffirmative demonstration, it cannot rely on Exemption (b)(3) to shield from disclosure everything\n\nit considers to be in some way “related” to the grand jury’s proceedings.\n\n               C.      DOJ’s Vaughn Index\n\n       “The measure of a Vaughn index is its descriptive accuracy,” King v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\n830 F.2d 210, 225 (D.C. Cir. 1987), and DOJ’s Vaughn Index fails to measure up. To achieve the\n\nnecessary level of descriptive accuracy, “[a] withholding agency [generally] must describe each\n\ndocument or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of\n\ndisclosing the sought-after information.” Id. at 223–24 (D.C. Cir. 1987). “Vaughn’s call for\n\nspecificity imposes on the agency the burden of demonstrating applicability of the exemptions\n\ninvoked as to each document or segment withheld.” Id. at 224. Most importantly, “[c]ategorical\n\ndescription of redacted material coupled with categorical indication of anticipated consequences of\n\ndisclosure is clearly inadequate.” Id.\n\n       Therefore, “[i]f the government chooses to submit a short Vaughn Index containing\n\nabbreviated descriptions, it must supplement the index with detailed affidavits that do more than\n\nmerely repeat the same generalized categorization of content.” Am. Immigration Council v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 950 F. Supp. 2d 221, 236-37 (D.D.C. 2013) (emphasis added) (citing\n\n                                                   7\n\fJudicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 146 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Coastal States Gas Corp. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 861 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (index identifying ‘who wrote the\n\nmemorandum, to whom it was addressed, its date, and a brief description of the memorandum,’\n\naccompanied by affidavits drafted in ‘conclusory terms’ deemed insufficient)). So “[w]hile the\n\ngovernment need not furnish repetitive descriptions of the same type of document and may describe\n\ncommonalities among its withholdings, it must avoid resorting to explanation in generalities.” Id.\n\nAt the same time, a “‘document-by-document’ description in the Vaughn Index may not always be\n\nnecessary, particularly when the withholdings comprise multiple, duplicative records and when the\n\ngovernment’s supporting affidavits are ‘sufficiently detailed to allow the district court to fairly\n\nevaluate’ the application of a claimed exemption to distinct categories of documents.” Id. (quoting\n\nGallant v. NLRB, 26 F.3d 168, 173 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).\n\n       The four-page Vaughn Index DOJ submits is plainly insufficient under the King standard.\n\nIn addition to being exceptionally short, its descriptions of withheld documents are quite general\n\nand vague, and it links categories of withheld documents to corresponding FOIA exemptions in a\n\npurely conclusory manner. The affidavits, too, merely parrot the statutory standards that\n\ncorrespond to each exemption rather than provide any new detail. When an agency’s “declarations\n\nand Vaughn index recite the general elements of the [claimed FOIA exemption] without explaining\n\nin relative detail how they apply to the documents in question,” it has not met its burden to\n\ndemonstrate that it withheld each document properly. Envtl. Integrity Project v. Small Bus.\n\nAdmin., No. 1:13-CV-01962-CRC, 2015 WL 4647926, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 5, 2015) (emphasis\n\nadded). DOJ has failed to meet its burden here. 1\n\n\n\n       1\n        The Court is mindful, with respect to grand jury material, that listing individual records in\na Vaughn Index could defeat the very secrecy interests that Rule 6(e) is designed to protect. DOJ\nmay, therefore, describe the specific types of grand jury material it ultimately decides to withhold\n\n                                                    8\n\f        Because the Court finds that DOJ’s “Vaughn Index and explanations of the withholdings are\n\ninsufficient as a whole,” it cannot grant summary judgment for the agency. Id. As in American\n\nImmigration Council, if DOJ “does not produce the contested records, [it] must submit revised\n\ndocumentation that is sufficiently detailed and comprehensive to meet the evidentiary standards set\n\nout in King, 830 F.2d at 224, as well as the exemption-specific standards . . . .” Id.\n\n                D.      DOJ’s Demonstration of Nonsegregability\n\n        Under FOIA, an agency is required to provide “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a\n\nrecord . . . to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt\n\nunder this subsection.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). A “District Court ha[s] an affirmative duty to consider\n\nthe segregability issue” and make a segregability finding. Trans-Pac. Policing Agreement v. U.S.\n\nCustoms Serv., 177 F.3d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999). DOJ contends that it has fulfilled its\n\nsegregability obligation because one of its employees “attested that no reasonably segregable\n\ninformation has been withheld.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 20–21. Without a sufficient\n\nVaughn Index or more-detailed declarations, however, the Court cannot conclude that DOJ has\n\nfulfilled its segregability obligation.\n\n        “In order to demonstrate that all reasonably segregable material has been released, the\n\nagency must provide a ‘detailed justification’ for its non-segregability. However, the agency is not\n\nrequired to provide so much detail that the exempt material would be effectively disclosed.”\n\nJohnson v. Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Mead\n\nData, 566 F.2d at 261). When an agency provides a requestor with a “combination” of affidavits\n\nstating that all reasonably segregable information has been released, along with “a comprehensive\n\n\n\n\non a categorical basis either in a revised declaration or in a more-thorough Vaughn Index. What is\nmost important is that DOJ actually review the materials against the standards set forth in Senate of\nPuerto Rico and make the required affirmative showing.\n\n                                                   9\n\fVaughn index, describing each document withheld, as well as the exemption under which it was\n\nwithheld,” then it has taken action “sufficient to fulfill the agency’s obligation to show with\n\n‘reasonable specificity’ why a document cannot be further segregated.” Id. Here, however, all the\n\nCourt has before it is the vague declaration of an employee. The Court lacks both an adequate\n\n“Vaughn ind[ex] and copies of the redacted records,” Higgins v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 919 F. Supp.\n\n2d 131, 152 (D.D.C. 2013), which limits its ability to find that “all reasonably segregable records\n\nand portions of records have been released to [the] plaintiff,” id.

Compl. ¶ 3. On April 30, 2014, Bagwell lodged a\n\nFreedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request with the Executive Office for United States\n\nAttorneys (“EOUSA”), requesting “access to any and all records of investigations between\n\nNovember 1, 2011 and [April 30, 2014] that pertain to allegations of child sexual abuse that\n\noccurred on the campus of The Pennsylvania State University.” Id. ¶ 5. Bagwell’s interest in these\n\nparticular records stems from a now-closed federal criminal investigation of the Sandusky matter\n\nand an independent investigation into the school’s handling of it conducted by former FBI Director\n\nLouis J. Freeh and his law firm. Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1–2.\n\n       After some back-and-forth involving Bagwell, EOUSA’s FOIA/Privacy Act office, and\n\nDOJ’s Office of Information Policy (“OIP”), EOUSA provided Bagwell with a final response to his\n\nFOIA request on July 8, 2015, several months after Bagwell filed this action. It released 517 pages\n\nof records and withheld 104 pages in full. Id. at 4. It also withheld over 2,700 pages of records and\n\n86 gigabytes of electronic information that it never reviewed but instead categorically labeled\n\n“grand jury information” or “grand jury material.” Id.; Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 8–9.\n\fDOJ has now moved for summary judgment, contending that it has produced all of the responsive\n\nrecords to which Bagwell is entitled, and Bagwell has cross-moved for summary judgment,\n\ncontending that DOJ has not met its burden to show that the withheld records are exempt from\n\nFOIA’s disclosure requirements. Because the Court cannot determine—based on the declarations\n\nand Vaughn Index provided by DOJ—whether the search for responsive records was adequate or to\n\nwhat degree any FOIA exemptions shield the withheld documents from disclosure, it will defer\n\nresolution of the motions to allow DOJ an opportunity to supplement its documentation.\n\n       I.

Analysis\n\n       Both parties’ motions for summary judgment revolve around four main issues: (1) whether\n\nDOJ’s search for responsive records was adequate; (2) whether DOJ is operating under the correct\n\nlegal standard for withholding “grand jury material”; (3) whether DOJ’s Vaughn Index is adequate;\n\nand (4) whether DOJ has satisfied its segregability obligations. The Court will discuss each in turn.\n\n               A.      Adequacy of the Search\n\n       The Court cannot conclude, based on the record before it, that DOJ’s search for responsive\n\nrecords was adequate. “[A]n agency responding to a FOIA request must ‘conduct[] a search\n\nreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents,’ and, if challenged, must demonstrate\n\n‘beyond material doubt’ that the search was reasonable.” Truitt v.

(quoting Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351). “If,\n\nhowever, the record leaves substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the search, summary judgment\n\nfor the agency is not proper.” Id. Furthermore, “[i]n order to establish the adequacy of a search,\n\nagency affidavits must be . . . ‘relatively detailed and non-conclusory, and . . . submitted in good\n\nfaith.’” SafeCard Servs., Inc. v.

(quoting SafeCard Servs., 926 at 1200).\n\n       At present, DOJ has failed to demonstrate beyond material doubt that it has conducted a\n\nsearch reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. First, the FOIA contact person for\n\nthe United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (“USAO/MDPA”)\n\nattests to having searched “all systems of records located within the USAO/MDPA that were likely\n\nto contain responsive records to Plaintiff’s request,” Decl. of Jodi Matuszewski ¶ 15, but does not\n\nindicate whether this search included the office’s email system. Clearly, DOJ considered certain\n\nemails to be responsive to Bagwell’s request, as it acknowledged in its Vaughn Index that it\n\nwithheld some “email conversations among Assistant United States Attorneys.” Vaughn Index –\n\nEOUSA, ECF No. 12-5. The Court has no way of knowing, however, the method by which DOJ\n\nsearched for and located those particular emails and thus cannot determine whether the search was\n\nlikely to have captured all responsive emails. Second, the Court’s confusion over the status of any\n\nemail search is heightened by the public remarks of former FBI Director Freeh, who conducted the\n\nindependent investigation into the Sandusky matter “in parallel with several other active\n\ninvestigations by agencies and governmental authorities, including the . . . United States Attorney\n\n[for the Middle District of Pennsylvania].” Remarks of Louis Freeh, July 12, 2012, ECF No. 13-8.\n\nMr. Freeh stated that he “continuously interfaced and cooperated with those agencies and\n\n                                                   4\n\fauthorities,” id., which at least suggests that a record of communication may exist between his firm\n\nand USAO/MDPA regarding the investigation. While “an agency’s failure to find a particular\n\ndocument does not necessarily indicate that its search was inadequate,” North v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477627\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477627/north-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (D.D.C. 2011), in this instance the search’s apparent failure to\n\nuncover any material along these lines raises a legitimate question as to thoroughness of the search.\n\nThe current record thus leaves the Court in substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of DOJ’s search.\n\n               B.      Grand Jury Material\n\n       DOJ has also failed adequately to justify its invocation of FOIA Exemption (b)(3),\n\nspecifically as it relates to what DOJ labels “grand jury material.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ.\n\nJ. 9. This exemption “permits an agency to withhold material ‘specifically exempted from\n\ndisclosure by statute . . . provided that such statute [requires withholding] in such a manner as to\n\nleave no discretion on the issue.’ 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3).” Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico on Behalf of Judiciary Comm. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491446\"><a href=\"/opinion/491446/senate-of-the-commonwealth-of-puerto-rico-on-behalf-of-judiciary-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\nAs relevant here, “[t]he Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in turn, prohibit . . . disclosure of\n\n‘matters occurring before [a] grand jury.’ Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2). Relying on the incorporation of\n\nRule 6(e) within exemption (b)(3),” id., DOJ here contends that “grand jury material is categorically\n\nexempt,” and claims that “it is the customary practice of EOUSA when it receives requests for ‘all\n\nrecords’ as in this case, to inform the USAO to respond with all responsive records except for\n\nmaterials related to the grand jury, which are exempt as a matter of law.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot.\n\nSumm. J. 9. Not all material that relates to a grand jury, however, is exempt as a matter of law.\n\n       The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has held that “[t]here is no per se rule against\n\ndisclosure of any and all information which has reached the grand jury chambers.” Rather,\n\n       [t]he touchstone is whether disclosure would tend to reveal some secret aspect of the\n       grand jury’s investigation[—]such matters as the identities of witnesses or jurors, the\n       substance of testimony, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the deliberations\n\n                                                   5\n\f       or questions of jurors, and the like. The disclosure of information coincidentally\n       before the grand jury [which can] be revealed in such a manner that its revelation\n       would not elucidate the inner workings of the grand jury is not prohibited.\n\nSenate of Puerto Rico, 823 F.2d at 582 (internal quotation marks omitted). This approach makes\n\nsense from a policy perspective as well: “Automatically sealing all that a grand jury sees or hears\n\nwould enable the government to shield any information from public view indefinitely by the simple\n\nexpedient of presenting it to the grand jury.” Id.\n\n       This Court “recognize[s] the importance of maintaining the secrecy of grand jury\n\nproceedings, and acknowledge[s] the ‘necessarily broad’ scope of Rule 6(e).” Id. at 584 (quoting\n\nFund for Constitutional Gov’t v. Nat’l Archives & Records Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393165\"><a href=\"/opinion/393165/fund-for-constitutional-government-v-national-archives-and-records-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 866 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1981)). And “[i]t may turn out, in this case, that most, or even all, of the material withheld pursuant\n\nto exemption (b)(3) cannot be disclosed without compromising the secrecy of a grand jury’s\n\ndeliberations.” Id. But as in Senate of Puerto Rico, DOJ has “not yet supplied the information a\n\ncourt must have in order to intelligently make that judgment.” Id. DOJ does provide some\n\ninformation on this front, but not enough. For instance, it asserts that it “invoked Exemption 3 to\n\nwithhold names of grand jury witnesses,” correctly observing that “Exemption 3 applies to the\n\nidentities of” those witnesses. Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 9. It also implies that it withheld\n\na draft indictment, which “is most assuredly a document that reveals the strategy and direction of a\n\ngrand jury investigation.” Id. Without any additional specificity as to what documents and files it\n\nwithheld, however, DOJ has not demonstrated—and the Court cannot determine—that all 2,700\n\npages and 86 gigabytes of withheld material would reveal some secret aspect of the grand jury’s\n\nproceedings or deliberations. The Court is further troubled by the possibility that no review was\n\never conducted of the “records related to the grand jury proceedings” in the first place.\n\nMatuszewski Decl. ¶ 14. Without such a review, it is unclear how EOUSA could determine that the\n\nexemption applies, let alone “suppl[y] the information a court must have in order to intelligently\n\n                                                     6\n\fmake [the] judgment” that the material it withheld would reveal some secret aspect of the grand\n\njury’s inner workings or investigation. Senate of Puerto Rico, 823 F.2d at 584.\n\n       Under Senate of Puerto Rico, it is insufficient for an agency to withhold documents merely\n\nbecause those documents had been the subject of a subpoena or at some point were before a grand\n\njury. Id. “[U]nless” the fact that “material has been presented to the grand jury . . . automatically\n\nexempts the material [from disclosure], a position [the D.C. Circuit] reject[s], it is incumbent upon\n\n[a court] to require some affirmative demonstration of a nexus between disclosure and revelation of\n\na protected aspect of the grand jury’s investigation.” Id. Unless and until DOJ makes that\n\naffirmative demonstration, it cannot rely on Exemption (b)(3) to shield from disclosure everything\n\nit considers to be in some way “related” to the grand jury’s proceedings.\n\n               C.      DOJ’s Vaughn Index\n\n       “The measure of a Vaughn index is its descriptive accuracy,” King v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495205\"><a href=\"/opinion/495205/cynthia-king-v-united-states-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 225 (D.C. Cir. 1987), and DOJ’s Vaughn Index fails to measure up. To achieve the\n\nnecessary level of descriptive accuracy, “[a] withholding agency [generally] must describe each\n\ndocument or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of\n\ndisclosing the sought-after information.” Id. at 223–24 (D.C. Cir. 1987). “Vaughn’s call for\n\nspecificity imposes on the agency the burden of demonstrating applicability of the exemptions\n\ninvoked as to each document or segment withheld.” Id. at 224. Most importantly, “[c]ategorical\n\ndescription of redacted material coupled with categorical indication of anticipated consequences of\n\ndisclosure is clearly inadequate.” Id.\n\n       Therefore, “[i]f the government chooses to submit a short Vaughn Index containing\n\nabbreviated descriptions, it must supplement the index with detailed affidavits that do more than\n\nmerely repeat the same generalized categorization of content.” Am.

So “[w]hile the\n\ngovernment need not furnish repetitive descriptions of the same type of document and may describe\n\ncommonalities among its withholdings, it must avoid resorting to explanation in generalities.” Id.\n\nAt the same time, a “‘document-by-document’ description in the Vaughn Index may not always be\n\nnecessary, particularly when the withholdings comprise multiple, duplicative records and when the\n\ngovernment’s supporting affidavits are ‘sufficiently detailed to allow the district court to fairly\n\nevaluate’ the application of a claimed exemption to distinct categories of documents.” Id.

When an agency’s “declarations\n\nand Vaughn index recite the general elements of the [claimed FOIA exemption] without explaining\n\nin relative detail how they apply to the documents in question,” it has not met its burden to\n\ndemonstrate that it withheld each document properly.

Small Bus.\n\nAdmin., No. 1:13-CV-01962-CRC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4647926</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 5, 2015) (emphasis\n\nadded). DOJ has failed to meet its burden here. 1\n\n\n\n       1\n        The Court is mindful, with respect to grand jury material, that listing individual records in\na Vaughn Index could defeat the very secrecy interests that Rule 6(e) is designed to protect. DOJ\nmay, therefore, describe the specific types of grand jury material it ultimately decides to withhold\n\n                                                    8\n\f        Because the Court finds that DOJ’s “Vaughn Index and explanations of the withholdings are\n\ninsufficient as a whole,” it cannot grant summary judgment for the agency. Id. As in American\n\nImmigration Council, if DOJ “does not produce the contested records, [it] must submit revised\n\ndocumentation that is sufficiently detailed and comprehensive to meet the evidentiary standards set\n\nout in King, 830 F.2d at 224, as well as the exemption-specific standards . . . .” Id.\n\n                D.      DOJ’s Demonstration of Nonsegregability\n\n        Under FOIA, an agency is required to provide “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a\n\nrecord . . . to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt\n\nunder this subsection.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). A “District Court ha[s] an affirmative duty to consider\n\nthe segregability issue” and make a segregability finding. Trans-Pac. Policing Agreement v. U.S.\n\nCustoms Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184907\"><a href=\"/opinion/184907/trans-pac-policing-v-us-customs-svc/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999). DOJ contends that it has fulfilled its\n\nsegregability obligation because one of its employees “attested that no reasonably segregable\n\ninformation has been withheld.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 20–21. Without a sufficient\n\nVaughn Index or more-detailed declarations, however, the Court cannot conclude that DOJ has\n\nfulfilled its segregability obligation.\n\n        “In order to demonstrate that all reasonably segregable material has been released, the\n\nagency must provide a ‘detailed justification’ for its non-segregability. However, the agency is not\n\nrequired to provide so much detail that the exempt material would be effectively disclosed.”\n\nJohnson v. Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185805\"><a href=\"/opinion/185805/johnson-neil-v-exec-off-us-atty/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Mead\n\nData, 566 F.2d at 261). When an agency provides a requestor with a “combination” of affidavits\n\nstating that all reasonably segregable information has been released, along with “a comprehensive\n\n\n\n\non a categorical basis either in a revised declaration or in a more-thorough Vaughn Index. What is\nmost important is that DOJ actually review the materials against the standards set forth in Senate of\nPuerto Rico and make the required affirmative showing.\n\n                                                   9\n\fVaughn index, describing each document withheld, as well as the exemption under which it was\n\nwithheld,” then it has taken action “sufficient to fulfill the agency’s obligation to show with\n\n‘reasonable specificity’ why a document cannot be further segregated.” Id. Here, however, all the\n\nCourt has before it is the vague declaration of an employee. The Court lacks both an adequate\n\n“Vaughn ind[ex] and copies of the redacted records,” Higgins v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 131, 152 (D.D.C. 2013), which limits its ability to find that “all reasonably segregable records\n\nand portions of records have been released to [the] plaintiff,” id. As a result, the Court is unable to\n\nmake a segregability finding at this time.\n\n        III.   Conclusion\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\n\n        ORDERED that Defendant shall conduct any necessary additional searches, and file a\n\nsupplemental memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment, including additional\n\naffidavits and a revised Vaughn index, on or before January 29, 2016.\n\n        ORDERED that Plaintiff shall respond to Defendant’s supplemental submissions on or\n\nbefore February 12, 2016.\n\n        SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              CHRISTOPHER R.
