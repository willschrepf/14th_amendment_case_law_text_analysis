J.W. is eligible to receive\n\nspecial education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of\n\n2004, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487. A Hearing Officer found that the individualized educational\n\nprogram (IEP) that the District of Columbia created for J.W. complied with the statute, but that\n\nthe IEP should be amended to include a residential school placement based on a psychiatrist’s\n\nrecommendation. The District of Columbia moves for summary judgment, seeking to vacate\n\npartially the Hearing Officer’s Decision. The District was unaware of the psychiatrist’s\n\nrecommendation at the time it created the IEP. Mr. Walker seeks to affirm the Hearing Officer’s\n\nDecision and to compel the District of Columbia to reimburse him for J.W.’s residential\n\nplacement at a boarding school, the Asheville Academy for Girls.\n\n                                            I. FACTS\n\n               A. Statutory Framework\n\n               The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400 et seq., “aims to ensure that every child has a meaningful opportunity to benefit from\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fpublic education.” Boose v. District of Columbia, No. 14-7086, 2015 WL 3371818, at *1 (D.C.\n\nCir. May 26, 2015). The statute ensures that “all children with disabilities have available to them\n\na free appropriate public education [or FAPE] that emphasizes special education and related\n\nservices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,\n\nemployment, and independent living.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). Under IDEA, school systems\n\nmust promptly identify, locate, and evaluate every child with disabilities residing in the district\n\nwho is in need of special education and related services. Id. § 1412(a)(3)(A). When a disabled\n\nchild is identified, the child’s parents, teachers, school officials, and other professionals\n\ncollaborate in an “IEP team” to develop an individualized educational program (IEP) to meet the\n\nchild’s unique needs. See id. §§ 1412(a)(4), 1414(d)(1)(B). The IEP is a written statement that\n\nincludes goals and instructional objectives for the student’s education, services to be provided,\n\nprojections regarding the dates on which such services are to be offered, and criteria for\n\nevaluating whether instructional objectives are met. Id. §§ 1401(14), 1414(d)(1)(A). The IEP\n\nteam may determine that in order to benefit from special education, the student requires “related\n\nservices”––i.e., non-educational, supportive services such as physical and occupational therapy\n\nand psychological counseling. See id. § 1414(d)(1)(B); 34 C.F.R. § 300.24(a). “[T]he IEP must,\n\nat a minimum, provide personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the\n\nchild to benefit educationally from that instruction . . . . If no suitable public school is available,\n\nthe [school system] must pay the costs of sending the child to an appropriate private school.”\n\nReid ex rel. Reid v. District of Columbia, 401 F.3d 516, 519 (D.C. Cir. 2005). A disabled child\n\ncan be reevaluated if the school determines it is warranted to meet the child’s needs or if the\n\nchild’s parent or teacher requests a reevaluation. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(2)(A). A reevaluation\n\n“shall occur (1) not more frequently than once a year, unless the parent and the [school] agree\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fotherwise; and at least once every 3 years, unless the parent and the [school] agree that a\n\nreevaluation is unnecessary.” Id. § 1414(a)(2)(B).\n\n                To determine whether a FAPE has been provided, courts must determine whether:\n\n(1) the school complied with the IDEA’s procedures; and (2) the IEP developed through those\n\nprocedures was reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive educational benefits.\n\nLoren F. v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., 349 F.3d 1309, 1312 (11th Cir. 2003). While the District of\n\nColumbia is required to provide disabled students a FAPE, it is not required to, and does not\n\nguarantee, any particular outcome or any particular level of academic success. See Bd. of Educ.\n\nof Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 192 (1982); Dorros v. District\n\nof Columbia, 510 F. Supp. 2d 97, 100 (D.D.C. 2007). If a parent objects to the identification,\n\nevaluation, or educational placement of a disabled child, or whether she is receiving a FAPE, the\n\nparent may seek a due process hearing before a D.C. Hearing Officer, who issues a determination\n\nknown as a Hearing Officer Decision or HOD. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(b)(6), 1415(f)(1)(A). If a\n\nparty is dissatisfied with that decision, it may appeal to a state court or a federal district court.\n\nSee id. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n                B. Background\n\n                J.W. is an eleven-year-old student with significant social emotional issues; she\n\nhas had five psychiatric hospitalizations since October 2012. Administrative Record (AR) [Dkt.\n\n5] at 7-8. The October 2012 hospitalization was precipitated by an incident during which J.W.\n\nexperienced command hallucinations to harm herself and her younger twin brothers and she\n\nattempted to push the twins down a flight of stairs. AR at 7. At the beginning of the 2013-14\n\nschool year, J.W. attended St. Patrick’s Episcopal Day School, a private non-special education\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fschool in the District of Columbia. 1 Id. at 8. Due to significant psychiatric issues, her father\n\nobtained an independent psychological evaluation and, on September 18, 2013, J.W. was\n\ndiagnosed with “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Disruptive Mood Disorder, Specific Learning\n\nDisorder with Impairment in Mathematics with impaired accuracy and fluency of calculations,\n\nmoderate severity, Language Disorder, and Reactive Attachment Disorder.” Id.\n\n                  Based on this psychological evaluation, on November 20, 2013, Mr. Walker\n\nrequested that the District identify J.W. as a student with a disability and provide her with an\n\nIEP. Id. Soon thereafter, J.W.’s mental health deteriorated and she was hospitalized. After her\n\nrelease from the hospital, on January 23, 2014, Mr. Walker unilaterally placed J.W. at a private\n\nboarding school, Asheville Academy for Girls, located Asheville, North Carolina. Id. The\n\nAsheville Academy has not been approved by the D.C. Office of the State Superintendent of\n\nEducation (OSSE) as a residential treatment facility, and it has not been approved by its own\n\nstate, North Carolina, for special education placement. HOD 10/14/14 [Dkt. 6-1] at 8.\n\n                 On March 24, 2014, Mr. Walker filed a due process complaint against District of\n\nColumbia Public Schools (DCPS), alleging that the District failed to identify J.W. as a disabled\n\nstudent in need of educational services. Compl. [Dkt. 1] ¶ 10. The due process complaint\n\nresulted in a May 28, 2014 Hearing Officer Decision, which ordered the District to determine\n\nJ.W.’s eligibility and to develop an IEP by June 30, 2014. See id. ¶ 14; HOD 5/28/14 [Dkt. 6-2]\n\nat 10.\n\n                 On June 16, 2014, the parties convened an eligibility meeting, and J.W. was found\n\nto be disabled and eligible for services under IDEA. Compl. ¶ 16. On June 27, 2014, three days\n\nbefore the June 30 deadline, the District developed an IEP for J.W. The IEP consisted of goals,\n\n\n1\n    J.W. has never attended a District of Columbia Public School. Compl. [Dkt. 1] ¶ 7.\n\n                                                  4\n\fservices, and accommodations, including 26.5 hours of specialized instruction outside of a\n\ngeneral education setting and 240 minutes of counseling per month. Id. ¶ 17; HOD 10/14/14 at\n\n2. DCPS proposed to place J.W. in a program for students with emotional and behavioral\n\ndifficulties located at a DCPS middle school. HOD 10/14/14 at 2. On July 8 and again on July\n\n28, 2014, Mr. Walker wrote to the District, complaining that J.W.’s placement was inappropriate.\n\nId. He sent the District a July 22, 2014, letter from J.W.’s treating psychiatrist in Asheville, Dr.\n\nSarah Wells. In her letter, Dr. Wells stated:\n\n                [I]t is my strong opinion that [J.W.] requires ongoing residential\n                treatment. She has had numerous behavioral concerns and issues\n                with medication compliance. She has also suffered from psychotic\n                symptoms and dissociation. . . . She was unable to maintain normal\n                functioning in an outpatient environment, and she continues to need\n                a higher level of care.\n\nAR at 147.\n\n                On August 13, 2014, Mr. Walker filed a due process complaint, claiming that the\n\nnon-residential placement constituted a denial of FAPE because J.W. can only access her\n\neducation in a residential setting. Id. at 11; HOD 10/14/14 at 2-3. The Hearing Officer held a\n\npre-hearing conference on August 29, 2014, and issued an order on September 4, 2014, setting\n\nforth the issues to be litigated:\n\n                (1) Whether the District denied J.W. a FAPE by failing to provide\n                her an appropriate IEP or placement at the June 27, 2014 meeting;\n                and\n\n                (2) Whether Mr. Walker should be awarded compensation for delays\n                in providing J.W. with a proper placement.\n\nId. at 3. The Hearing Officer restated the issues at the beginning of the due process hearing on\n\nSeptember 29, 2014, and the parties agreed that these were the issued to be litigated. Id. at 3 n.3.\n\nThe due process hearing was continued on October 6, and the Hearing Officer rendered a\n\nDecision on October 14, 2014. Id. at 1.\n\n                                                  5\n\f               The Hearing Officer determined that Mr. Walker did not sustain his burden of\n\nproving that the IEP developed for J.W. at the June 27, 2014 meeting was not reasonably\n\ncalculated to provide the student educational benefit at the time it was developed. 2 However, the\n\nHearing Officer also decided, based on evidence presented at the hearing that was not available\n\nto the IEP team, that J.W. was in need of a residential placement. Id. at 9-13. The Hearing\n\nOfficer found that Dr. Wells testified credibly at the due process hearing, and that while J.W.’s\n\ncondition had improved since she began attending the Asheville Academy in January 2014, she\n\nrequired “ongoing residential treatment because of her behavioral concerns and issues with\n\nmedication compliance and she would be unable to maintain normal functioning in an outpatient\n\nenvironment and a full time day program without any significant safety risks.” HOD 10/14/14 at\n\n9. As a result, the Hearing Officer ordered DCPS to amend J.W.’s IEP to include residential\n\nplacement. He further ordered DCPS to (1) find a residential placement or assist Asheville\n\nAcademy in obtaining OSSE-approval to serve as J.W.’s residential placement and (2) reimburse\n\nMr. Walker for the costs of J.W.’s attendance at the Asheville Academy. Id. at 13-14.\n\n               The District of Columbia appealed, arguing that the Hearing Officer erroneously\n\ndecided issues outside those identified for adjudication. The District moved for a temporary\n\nrestraining order and preliminary injunction staying the October 14, 2014 HOD. Mr. Walker\n\nobjected. The Court held a hearing on December 4, 2014, and granted in part and denied in part\n\nthe request for injunction. See Order 12/4/14 [Dkt. 9].\n\n\n\n2\n  The Hearing Officer also found that Mr. Walker should be awarded $3,600 in compensation for\nthe delay in providing an appropriate placement. Because the parties agreed that the Hearing\nOfficer erred in ordering $3,600 in reimbursement for the student’s tuition and related services\nfor June 2014, the Court stayed the $3,600 reimbursement requirement. See Order 12/4/14 [Dkt.\n9]; see also Order 1/16/15 [Dkt. 14]. The reimbursement requirement of $3,600 will be vacated\nwith the Order accompanying this Opinion.\n\n                                                 6\n\f               At the December 4 injunction hearing, counsel for Mr. Walker argued that J.W.\n\ncurrently required a residential placement. Counsel represented she was making progress at the\n\nAsheville Academy, and that there was no appropriate residential placement available in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia. To preserve the status quo pending a decision on the merits, the Court\n\n(1) took under advisement the District’s request to stay its reimbursement for tuition and costs of\n\nAsheville Academy and (2) ordered the District of Columbia to convene a meeting of the IEP\n\nTeam and determine the educational placement for J.W. by January 6, 2015. See Order 12/4/14\n\n[Dkt. 9]. The Court directed that an appropriate residential placement would be “presumptively\n\nthe correct placement” for J.W., unless the IEP Team were to articulate why a residential\n\nplacement is not required. Id. at 2.\n\n               An IEP meeting was convened on December 18, 2014. The Asheville Academy\n\nprogram director, Bryan Tomes, and J.W.’s therapist at Asheville, Heidi Anderson, attended the\n\nmeeting by phone. See Notes [Dkt. 11-3] at 1. Mr. Tomes and Ms. Anderson indicated that J.W.\n\nwas receiving about nine hours of therapy per week. Id. at 2. When J.W. first came to the\n\nAcademy in January 2014, the therapist had to intervene about once per week due to J.W.’s\n\nbehavioral issues; as of December 2014, the therapist found she needed to intervene only once\n\nper month. See Notes [Dkt. 11-2] at 2. Mr. Walker submitted a December 16, 2014 letter from\n\nDr. Wells stating that J.W. “continues to work through difficult issues related to her trauma\n\nhistory, and needs the close proximity of support staff and her therapist . . . Given her symptoms,\n\nshe is unable to access her educational needs outside a residential treatment setting. . . . I feel\n\nthat she would not be able to function well in the outpatient/home environment at this time.”\n\nNotes [Dkt. 11-3] at 5. Despite Dr. Wells’ opinion, the District took the position that it could\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fmeet J.W.’s needs in a full time day setting, in a program with a maximum of ten students, a\n\nteacher, a behavior technician, and an aide. 3 Id. at 4.\n\n               As a result of the meeting, J.W.’s IEP remained unchanged and the District\n\noffered placement in a non-residential program at Whittier Education Campus, a D.C. public\n\nschool with the programming to meet J.W.’s needs. See Letter to Parent 12/23/14 [Dkt. 11-6].\n\nMr. Walker rejected this placement and opted to maintain J.W.’s enrollment at Asheville\n\nAcademy.\n\n               The Court held a status conference on January 7, 2015. 4 Afterward, the parties\n\nmet and conferred. They agreed that the District’s motion to stay the October 14, 2014 HOD\n\nshould be granted in part and denied in part and that the District would partially reimburse Mr.\n\nWalker for J.W.’s placement at the Asheville Academy pending resolution of this case on the\n\nmerits. See Supplement 1/14/2015 [Dkt. 13]. The Court entered an Order effectuating the\n\nparties’ agreement and ordering the District of Columbia to reimburse Mr. Walker for the\n\nstudent’s tuition and related services at Asheville Academy going forward, less $500.00 for each\n\nschool year, unless and until an appropriate OSSE-approved residential school is identified and a\n\nreasonably comprehensive transition plan is developed. Order 1/16/15 [Dkt. 14] at 1-2. The\n\nCourt expressly recognized that the District’s appeal of the October 12, 2014 HOD was not\n\nrendered moot, and ordered the parties to finish briefing on the District’s motion for summary\n\n\n\n\n3\n The IEP team considered little in the way of current facts regarding the student––Dr. Wells did\nnot provide any facts to support her opinion, and no one from DCPS met J.W. or conducted an\nevaluation.\n4\n  At that hearing, the District represented that it had earlier offered J.W. a residential placement\nat Devereaux, a behavioral healthcare center in the District of Columbia, but Mr. Walker rejected\nthe placement as too restrictive.\n\n                                                  8\n\fjudgment. Id. The motion for summary judgment is now fully briefed and ready for decision.\n\nSee Mot. for Summ. J. (MSJ) [Dkt. 6]; Opp’n [Dkt. 12]; Reply [Dkt. 15].\n\n                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n               Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment must\n\nbe granted when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986); see also Diamond v. Atwood, 43 F.3d\n\n1538, 1540 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Moreover, summary judgment is properly granted against a party\n\nwho “after adequate time for discovery and upon motion . . . fails to make a showing sufficient to\n\nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will\n\nbear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).\n\n               In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must draw all justifiable\n\ninferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the mere\n\nexistence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252. In addition, the\n\nnonmoving party may not rely solely on allegations or conclusory statements. Greene v. Dalton,\n\n164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Rather, the nonmoving party must present specific facts that\n\nwould enable a reasonable jury to find in its favor. Id. If the evidence “is merely colorable, or is\n\nnot significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n               In an IDEA case, a court must review the administrative record and it may hear\n\nadditional evidence at the request of a party; the court bases its decision on the preponderance of\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fthe evidence, granting such relief it deems appropriate. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii). A court\n\ngives “due weight” to the HOD and does not substitute its own view of sound educational policy\n\nfor that of the hearing officer. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206. Moreover, the burden of proof is\n\nwith the party challenging the administrative determination, who must “at least take on the\n\nburden of persuading the court that the hearing officer was wrong.” Reid, 401 F.3d at 521\n\n(quoting Kerkam v. McKenzie, 862 F.2d 884, 887 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). If neither party requests that\n\nthe court hear additional evidence, then the court may determine the case based on the\n\nadministrative record on summary judgment. Heather S. v. Wisconsin, 125 F.3d 1045, 1052 (7th\n\nCir. 1997). Here, neither party has requested that the Court hear additional evidence; thus, the\n\nCourt bases its decision on a review of the administrative record. See AR [Dkt. 5].\n\n                                         III. ANALYSIS\n\n               When reviewing an administrative decision under the IDEA, a court must\n\ndetermine whether the procedural requirements were met and whether the IEP, including the\n\nstudent’s placement, was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\n\nbenefits. Shaw v. Dist. of Columbia, 238 F. Supp. 2d 127, 134 (D.D.C. 2002) (citing Rowley,\n\n458 U.S. at 206-07). The IDEA establishes a “basic floor of opportunity”; it does not require\n\nthat a school provide the very best educational experience. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 201. School\n\ndistricts must provide “an educational benefit” by providing an appropriate education. Id.\n\n“[P]arents who unilaterally change their child’s placement during the pendency of review\n\nproceedings, without the consent of state or local school officials, do so at their own financial\n\nrisk.” Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep’t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 373-74 (1985). If the court\n\ndetermines that the IEP and placement proposed by school officials was appropriate, the parent is\n\nnot entitled to reimbursement for the unilateral placement of the child at a private school. Id. at\n\n374.\n                                                 10\n\f               In this case, the Hearing Officer determined that Mr. Walker did not meet his\n\nburden of proving that J.W. was in need of a residential placement at the time the IEP was\n\nformulated on June 27, 2014. However, the Hearing Officer also determined that, at the time of\n\nthe HOD, the IEP placement in a day school was inappropriate because J.W. needed residential\n\nplacement. HOD 10/14/14 at 9. The Hearing Officer credited Dr. Wells’ testimony. Id.\n\n               The Hearing Officer’s ruling was beyond the issue that the parties agreed to\n\nlitigate, i.e., whether the District denied J.W. a FAPE by failing to provide her an appropriate\n\nIEP or placement at the time the June 27, 2014 IEP was formulated. The due process complaint\n\ndescribed the issue as whether DCPs denied J.W. a FAPE by failing to provide her an\n\nappropriate IEP or placement at the June 27, 2014 meeting or thereafter. AR at 10. However,\n\nthe phrase “or thereafter” was dropped at the pre-hearing conference, and the parties agreed to\n\nthe change. HOD 10/14/14 at 3 n.3.\n\n               The issue was properly defined at the pre-hearing conference because the\n\nadequacy of an IEP can be measured only at the time it is formulated, not in hindsight. “[T]he\n\nmeasure and adequacy of an IEP can only be determined as of the time it is offered to the\n\nstudent. Neither the statute nor reason countenance ‘Monday Morning Quarterbacking’ in\n\nevaluating the appropriateness of a child’s placement.” S.S. ex rel. Schank v. Howard Road\n\nAcademy, 585 F. Supp. 2d 56, 66 (D.D.C. 2008) (quoting Thompson R2-J Sch. Dist. v. Luke P.,\n\n540 F.3d 1143, 1149 (10th Cir. 2008)). An IEP “should be reasonably calculated to enable the\n\nchild to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 204. “An\n\nIEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective. In striving for ‘appropriateness,’ an IEP must take into\n\naccount what was, and was not, objectively reasonable when the snapshot was taken, that is at\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fthe time the IEP was promulgated.” Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 992 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n               The Hearing Officer found that Mr. Walker did not sustain his burden of proving\n\nthat the June 27 IEP was not reasonably calculated to provide J.W. an educational benefit at that\n\ntime. See HOD 10/14/14 at 9. Mr. Walker does not challenge this finding. Instead, he asserts\n\nthat the IEP was inappropriate based on subsequent evidence, i.e., Dr. Wells July 22, 2014 letter\n\nand her testimony at the due process hearing. Because an IEP must be evaluated as of the date it\n\nwas created, the Hearing Officer erred when he relied on evidence that was not presented to the\n\nIEP Team. Based on the evidence presented to the IEP Team, the IEP was appropriate in June\n\n2014. 5 Id.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated above, the Court will grant the District of Columbia’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment [Dkt. 6], and judgment will be entered in favor of the District.\n\nThe October 14, 2014 Hearing Officer Decision will be affirmed in part and vacated in part as\n\nfollows: The HOD finding that the June 27, 2014 IEP was reasonably calculated to provide J.W.\n\nan adequate education at the time the IEP was formulated will be affirmed, and the $3,600\n\n\n\n5\n  Residential placement may be necessary to provide a student a FAPE under the IDEA. To\ndetermine whether a residential placement is appropriate, a court must analyze “whether full time\nplacement may be considered necessary for educational purposes, or whether the residential\nplacement is a response to medical, social or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process.” McKenzie v. Smith, 771 F.2d 1527, 1534 (D.C. Cir. 1985). “Residential\nplacement may be necessary when the disabled child needs a highly structured environment in\norder to obtain any kind of educational benefit. . . . School districts are not, however, financially\nresponsible for the placement of students who need twenty-four-hour supervision for medical,\nsocial, or emotional reasons, and receive only an incidental educational benefit from that\nplacement.” Munir v. Pottsville Area Sch. Dist., 723 F. 3d 423, 431 (3d Cir. 2013). This issue\nwas not raised before the IEP team, was not addressed by the Hearing Officer, and is not before\nthis Court.\n\n                                                 12\n\freimbursement requirement set forth in the HOD will be vacated. The requirement that the\n\nDistrict reimburse Mr. Walker partially for tuition and costs at Asheville Academy, as set forth\n\nin the Order [Dkt. 14], shall cease to have effect as of as this date. The District (via the IEP\n\nteam) shall reevaluate J.W. based on current information and shall consider (1) whether the IEP\n\nrequires modification and (2) whether residential placement is appropriate. 6 The parties shall file\n\na status report as directed by Court Order. This Opinion is accompanied by a memorializing\n\nOrder.\n\n\n\nDate: June 12, 2015                                          /s/\n                                               ROSEMARY M.

J.W. is eligible to receive\n\nspecial education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of\n\n2004, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487. A Hearing Officer found that the individualized educational\n\nprogram (IEP) that the District of Columbia created for J.W. complied with the statute, but that\n\nthe IEP should be amended to include a residential school placement based on a psychiatrist’s\n\nrecommendation. The District of Columbia moves for summary judgment, seeking to vacate\n\npartially the Hearing Officer’s Decision. The District was unaware of the psychiatrist’s\n\nrecommendation at the time it created the IEP. Mr. Walker seeks to affirm the Hearing Officer’s\n\nDecision and to compel the District of Columbia to reimburse him for J.W.’s residential\n\nplacement at a boarding school, the Asheville Academy for Girls.\n\n                                            I. FACTS\n\n               A. Statutory Framework\n\n               The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400 et seq., “aims to ensure that every child has a meaningful opportunity to benefit from\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fpublic education.” Boose v. District of Columbia, No. 14-7086, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3371818</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (D.C.\n\nCir. May 26, 2015). The statute ensures that “all children with disabilities have available to them\n\na free appropriate public education [or FAPE] that emphasizes special education and related\n\nservices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,\n\nemployment, and independent living.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). Under IDEA, school systems\n\nmust promptly identify, locate, and evaluate every child with disabilities residing in the district\n\nwho is in need of special education and related services. Id. § 1412(a)(3)(A). When a disabled\n\nchild is identified, the child’s parents, teachers, school officials, and other professionals\n\ncollaborate in an “IEP team” to develop an individualized educational program (IEP) to meet the\n\nchild’s unique needs. See id. §§ 1412(a)(4), 1414(d)(1)(B). The IEP is a written statement that\n\nincludes goals and instructional objectives for the student’s education, services to be provided,\n\nprojections regarding the dates on which such services are to be offered, and criteria for\n\nevaluating whether instructional objectives are met. Id. §§ 1401(14), 1414(d)(1)(A). The IEP\n\nteam may determine that in order to benefit from special education, the student requires “related\n\nservices”––i.e., non-educational, supportive services such as physical and occupational therapy\n\nand psychological counseling. See id. § 1414(d)(1)(B); 34 C.F.R. § 300.24(a). “[T]he IEP must,\n\nat a minimum, provide personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the\n\nchild to benefit educationally from that instruction . . . . If no suitable public school is available,\n\nthe [school system] must pay the costs of sending the child to an appropriate private school.”\n\nReid ex rel. Reid v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186398\"><a href=\"/opinion/186398/reid-gwendolyn-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519 (D.C. Cir. 2005). A disabled child\n\ncan be reevaluated if the school determines it is warranted to meet the child’s needs or if the\n\nchild’s parent or teacher requests a reevaluation. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(2)(A). A reevaluation\n\n“shall occur (1) not more frequently than once a year, unless the parent and the [school] agree\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fotherwise; and at least once every 3 years, unless the parent and the [school] agree that a\n\nreevaluation is unnecessary.” Id. § 1414(a)(2)(B).\n\n                To determine whether a FAPE has been provided, courts must determine whether:\n\n(1) the school complied with the IDEA’s procedures; and (2) the IEP developed through those\n\nprocedures was reasonably calculated to enable the student to receive educational benefits.\n\nLoren F. v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76390\"><a href=\"/opinion/76390/loren-f-v-atlanta-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1312 (11th Cir. 2003). While the District of\n\nColumbia is required to provide disabled students a FAPE, it is not required to, and does not\n\nguarantee, any particular outcome or any particular level of academic success. See Bd. of Educ.\n\nof Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (1982); Dorros v.

If a parent objects to the identification,\n\nevaluation, or educational placement of a disabled child, or whether she is receiving a FAPE, the\n\nparent may seek a due process hearing before a D.C. Hearing Officer, who issues a determination\n\nknown as a Hearing Officer Decision or HOD. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(b)(6), 1415(f)(1)(A). If a\n\nparty is dissatisfied with that decision, it may appeal to a state court or a federal district court.\n\nSee id. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n                B. Background\n\n                J.W. is an eleven-year-old student with significant social emotional issues; she\n\nhas had five psychiatric hospitalizations since October 2012. Administrative Record (AR) [Dkt.\n\n5] at 7-8. The October 2012 hospitalization was precipitated by an incident during which J.W.\n\nexperienced command hallucinations to harm herself and her younger twin brothers and she\n\nattempted to push the twins down a flight of stairs. AR at 7. At the beginning of the 2013-14\n\nschool year, J.W. attended St. Patrick’s Episcopal Day School, a private non-special education\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fschool in the District of Columbia. 1 Id. at 8. Due to significant psychiatric issues, her father\n\nobtained an independent psychological evaluation and, on September 18, 2013, J.W. was\n\ndiagnosed with “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Disruptive Mood Disorder, Specific Learning\n\nDisorder with Impairment in Mathematics with impaired accuracy and fluency of calculations,\n\nmoderate severity, Language Disorder, and Reactive Attachment Disorder.” Id.\n\n                  Based on this psychological evaluation, on November 20, 2013, Mr. Walker\n\nrequested that the District identify J.W. as a student with a disability and provide her with an\n\nIEP. Id. Soon thereafter, J.W.’s mental health deteriorated and she was hospitalized. After her\n\nrelease from the hospital, on January 23, 2014, Mr. Walker unilaterally placed J.W. at a private\n\nboarding school, Asheville Academy for Girls, located Asheville, North Carolina. Id. The\n\nAsheville Academy has not been approved by the D.C. Office of the State Superintendent of\n\nEducation (OSSE) as a residential treatment facility, and it has not been approved by its own\n\nstate, North Carolina, for special education placement. HOD 10/14/14 [Dkt. 6-1] at 8.\n\n                 On March 24, 2014, Mr. Walker filed a due process complaint against District of\n\nColumbia Public Schools (DCPS), alleging that the District failed to identify J.W. as a disabled\n\nstudent in need of educational services. Compl. [Dkt. 1] ¶ 10. The due process complaint\n\nresulted in a May 28, 2014 Hearing Officer Decision, which ordered the District to determine\n\nJ.W.’s eligibility and to develop an IEP by June 30, 2014. See id. ¶ 14; HOD 5/28/14 [Dkt. 6-2]\n\nat 10.\n\n                 On June 16, 2014, the parties convened an eligibility meeting, and J.W. was found\n\nto be disabled and eligible for services under IDEA. Compl. ¶ 16. On June 27, 2014, three days\n\nbefore the June 30 deadline, the District developed an IEP for J.W. The IEP consisted of goals,\n\n\n1\n    J.W. has never attended a District of Columbia Public School. Compl. [Dkt. 1] ¶ 7.\n\n                                                  4\n\fservices, and accommodations, including 26.5 hours of specialized instruction outside of a\n\ngeneral education setting and 240 minutes of counseling per month. Id. ¶ 17; HOD 10/14/14 at\n\n2. DCPS proposed to place J.W. in a program for students with emotional and behavioral\n\ndifficulties located at a DCPS middle school. HOD 10/14/14 at 2. On July 8 and again on July\n\n28, 2014, Mr. Walker wrote to the District, complaining that J.W.’s placement was inappropriate.\n\nId. He sent the District a July 22, 2014, letter from J.W.’s treating psychiatrist in Asheville, Dr.\n\nSarah Wells. In her letter, Dr. Wells stated:\n\n                [I]t is my strong opinion that [J.W.] requires ongoing residential\n                treatment. She has had numerous behavioral concerns and issues\n                with medication compliance. She has also suffered from psychotic\n                symptoms and dissociation. . . . She was unable to maintain normal\n                functioning in an outpatient environment, and she continues to need\n                a higher level of care.\n\nAR at 147.\n\n                On August 13, 2014, Mr. Walker filed a due process complaint, claiming that the\n\nnon-residential placement constituted a denial of FAPE because J.W. can only access her\n\neducation in a residential setting. Id. at 11; HOD 10/14/14 at 2-3. The Hearing Officer held a\n\npre-hearing conference on August 29, 2014, and issued an order on September 4, 2014, setting\n\nforth the issues to be litigated:\n\n                (1) Whether the District denied J.W. a FAPE by failing to provide\n                her an appropriate IEP or placement at the June 27, 2014 meeting;\n                and\n\n                (2) Whether Mr. Walker should be awarded compensation for delays\n                in providing J.W. with a proper placement.\n\nId. at 3. The Hearing Officer restated the issues at the beginning of the due process hearing on\n\nSeptember 29, 2014, and the parties agreed that these were the issued to be litigated. Id. at 3 n.3.\n\nThe due process hearing was continued on October 6, and the Hearing Officer rendered a\n\nDecision on October 14, 2014. Id. at 1.\n\n                                                  5\n\f               The Hearing Officer determined that Mr. Walker did not sustain his burden of\n\nproving that the IEP developed for J.W. at the June 27, 2014 meeting was not reasonably\n\ncalculated to provide the student educational benefit at the time it was developed. 2 However, the\n\nHearing Officer also decided, based on evidence presented at the hearing that was not available\n\nto the IEP team, that J.W. was in need of a residential placement. Id. at 9-13. The Hearing\n\nOfficer found that Dr. Wells testified credibly at the due process hearing, and that while J.W.’s\n\ncondition had improved since she began attending the Asheville Academy in January 2014, she\n\nrequired “ongoing residential treatment because of her behavioral concerns and issues with\n\nmedication compliance and she would be unable to maintain normal functioning in an outpatient\n\nenvironment and a full time day program without any significant safety risks.” HOD 10/14/14 at\n\n9. As a result, the Hearing Officer ordered DCPS to amend J.W.’s IEP to include residential\n\nplacement. He further ordered DCPS to (1) find a residential placement or assist Asheville\n\nAcademy in obtaining OSSE-approval to serve as J.W.’s residential placement and (2) reimburse\n\nMr. Walker for the costs of J.W.’s attendance at the Asheville Academy. Id. at 13-14.\n\n               The District of Columbia appealed, arguing that the Hearing Officer erroneously\n\ndecided issues outside those identified for adjudication. The District moved for a temporary\n\nrestraining order and preliminary injunction staying the October 14, 2014 HOD. Mr. Walker\n\nobjected. The Court held a hearing on December 4, 2014, and granted in part and denied in part\n\nthe request for injunction. See Order 12/4/14 [Dkt. 9].\n\n\n\n2\n  The Hearing Officer also found that Mr. Walker should be awarded $3,600 in compensation for\nthe delay in providing an appropriate placement. Because the parties agreed that the Hearing\nOfficer erred in ordering $3,600 in reimbursement for the student’s tuition and related services\nfor June 2014, the Court stayed the $3,600 reimbursement requirement. See Order 12/4/14 [Dkt.\n9]; see also Order 1/16/15 [Dkt. 14]. The reimbursement requirement of $3,600 will be vacated\nwith the Order accompanying this Opinion.\n\n                                                 6\n\f               At the December 4 injunction hearing, counsel for Mr. Walker argued that J.W.\n\ncurrently required a residential placement. Counsel represented she was making progress at the\n\nAsheville Academy, and that there was no appropriate residential placement available in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia. To preserve the status quo pending a decision on the merits, the Court\n\n(1) took under advisement the District’s request to stay its reimbursement for tuition and costs of\n\nAsheville Academy and (2) ordered the District of Columbia to convene a meeting of the IEP\n\nTeam and determine the educational placement for J.W. by January 6, 2015. See Order 12/4/14\n\n[Dkt. 9]. The Court directed that an appropriate residential placement would be “presumptively\n\nthe correct placement” for J.W., unless the IEP Team were to articulate why a residential\n\nplacement is not required. Id. at 2.\n\n               An IEP meeting was convened on December 18, 2014. The Asheville Academy\n\nprogram director, Bryan Tomes, and J.W.’s therapist at Asheville, Heidi Anderson, attended the\n\nmeeting by phone. See Notes [Dkt. 11-3] at 1. Mr. Tomes and Ms. Anderson indicated that J.W.\n\nwas receiving about nine hours of therapy per week. Id. at 2. When J.W. first came to the\n\nAcademy in January 2014, the therapist had to intervene about once per week due to J.W.’s\n\nbehavioral issues; as of December 2014, the therapist found she needed to intervene only once\n\nper month. See Notes [Dkt. 11-2] at 2. Mr. Walker submitted a December 16, 2014 letter from\n\nDr. Wells stating that J.W. “continues to work through difficult issues related to her trauma\n\nhistory, and needs the close proximity of support staff and her therapist . . . Given her symptoms,\n\nshe is unable to access her educational needs outside a residential treatment setting. . . . I feel\n\nthat she would not be able to function well in the outpatient/home environment at this time.”\n\nNotes [Dkt. 11-3] at 5. Despite Dr. Wells’ opinion, the District took the position that it could\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fmeet J.W.’s needs in a full time day setting, in a program with a maximum of ten students, a\n\nteacher, a behavior technician, and an aide. 3 Id. at 4.\n\n               As a result of the meeting, J.W.’s IEP remained unchanged and the District\n\noffered placement in a non-residential program at Whittier Education Campus, a D.C. public\n\nschool with the programming to meet J.W.’s needs. See Letter to Parent 12/23/14 [Dkt. 11-6].\n\nMr. Walker rejected this placement and opted to maintain J.W.’s enrollment at Asheville\n\nAcademy.\n\n               The Court held a status conference on January 7, 2015. 4 Afterward, the parties\n\nmet and conferred. They agreed that the District’s motion to stay the October 14, 2014 HOD\n\nshould be granted in part and denied in part and that the District would partially reimburse Mr.\n\nWalker for J.W.’s placement at the Asheville Academy pending resolution of this case on the\n\nmerits. See Supplement 1/14/2015 [Dkt. 13]. The Court entered an Order effectuating the\n\nparties’ agreement and ordering the District of Columbia to reimburse Mr. Walker for the\n\nstudent’s tuition and related services at Asheville Academy going forward, less $500.00 for each\n\nschool year, unless and until an appropriate OSSE-approved residential school is identified and a\n\nreasonably comprehensive transition plan is developed. Order 1/16/15 [Dkt. 14] at 1-2. The\n\nCourt expressly recognized that the District’s appeal of the October 12, 2014 HOD was not\n\nrendered moot, and ordered the parties to finish briefing on the District’s motion for summary\n\n\n\n\n3\n The IEP team considered little in the way of current facts regarding the student––Dr. Wells did\nnot provide any facts to support her opinion, and no one from DCPS met J.W. or conducted an\nevaluation.\n4\n  At that hearing, the District represented that it had earlier offered J.W. a residential placement\nat Devereaux, a behavioral healthcare center in the District of Columbia, but Mr. Walker rejected\nthe placement as too restrictive.\n\n                                                  8\n\fjudgment. Id. The motion for summary judgment is now fully briefed and ready for decision.\n\nSee Mot. for Summ. J. (MSJ) [Dkt. 6]; Opp’n [Dkt. 12]; Reply [Dkt. 15].\n\n                                     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n               Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment must\n\nbe granted when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (1986); see also Diamond v.

Cir. 1995). Moreover, summary judgment is properly granted against a party\n\nwho “after adequate time for discovery and upon motion . . . fails to make a showing sufficient to\n\nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will\n\nbear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322 (1986).\n\n               In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must draw all justifiable\n\ninferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the mere\n\nexistence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252. In addition, the\n\nnonmoving party may not rely solely on allegations or conclusory statements. Greene v. Dalton,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Rather, the nonmoving party must present specific facts that\n\nwould enable a reasonable jury to find in its favor. Id. If the evidence “is merely colorable, or is\n\nnot significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n               In an IDEA case, a court must review the administrative record and it may hear\n\nadditional evidence at the request of a party; the court bases its decision on the preponderance of\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fthe evidence, granting such relief it deems appropriate. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii). A court\n\ngives “due weight” to the HOD and does not substitute its own view of sound educational policy\n\nfor that of the hearing officer. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206. Moreover, the burden of proof is\n\nwith the party challenging the administrative determination, who must “at least take on the\n\nburden of persuading the court that the hearing officer was wrong.” Reid, 401 F.3d at 521\n\n(quoting Kerkam v. McKenzie, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 887 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). If neither party requests that\n\nthe court hear additional evidence, then the court may determine the case based on the\n\nadministrative record on summary judgment. Heather S. v. Wisconsin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746767\"><a href=\"/opinion/746767/heather-s-by-her-natural-parent-and-next-friend-kathy-s-v-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1045</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1052 (7th\n\nCir. 1997). Here, neither party has requested that the Court hear additional evidence; thus, the\n\nCourt bases its decision on a review of the administrative record. See AR [Dkt. 5].\n\n                                         III. ANALYSIS\n\n               When reviewing an administrative decision under the IDEA, a court must\n\ndetermine whether the procedural requirements were met and whether the IEP, including the\n\nstudent’s placement, was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\n\nbenefits. Shaw v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418083\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418083/shaw-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 (D.D.C. 2002) (citing Rowley,\n\n458 U.S. at 206-07). The IDEA establishes a “basic floor of opportunity”; it does not require\n\nthat a school provide the very best educational experience. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 201. School\n\ndistricts must provide “an educational benefit” by providing an appropriate education. Id.\n\n“[P]arents who unilaterally change their child’s placement during the pendency of review\n\nproceedings, without the consent of state or local school officials, do so at their own financial\n\nrisk.” Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep’t of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111420\"><a href=\"/opinion/111420/burlington-school-comm-v-mass-dept-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373-74 (1985). If the court\n\ndetermines that the IEP and placement proposed by school officials was appropriate, the parent is\n\nnot entitled to reimbursement for the unilateral placement of the child at a private school. Id. at\n\n374.\n                                                 10\n\f               In this case, the Hearing Officer determined that Mr. Walker did not meet his\n\nburden of proving that J.W. was in need of a residential placement at the time the IEP was\n\nformulated on June 27, 2014. However, the Hearing Officer also determined that, at the time of\n\nthe HOD, the IEP placement in a day school was inappropriate because J.W. needed residential\n\nplacement. HOD 10/14/14 at 9. The Hearing Officer credited Dr. Wells’ testimony. Id.\n\n               The Hearing Officer’s ruling was beyond the issue that the parties agreed to\n\nlitigate, i.e., whether the District denied J.W. a FAPE by failing to provide her an appropriate\n\nIEP or placement at the time the June 27, 2014 IEP was formulated. The due process complaint\n\ndescribed the issue as whether DCPs denied J.W. a FAPE by failing to provide her an\n\nappropriate IEP or placement at the June 27, 2014 meeting or thereafter. AR at 10. However,\n\nthe phrase “or thereafter” was dropped at the pre-hearing conference, and the parties agreed to\n\nthe change. HOD 10/14/14 at 3 n.3.\n\n               The issue was properly defined at the pre-hearing conference because the\n\nadequacy of an IEP can be measured only at the time it is formulated, not in hindsight. “[T]he\n\nmeasure and adequacy of an IEP can only be determined as of the time it is offered to the\n\nstudent. Neither the statute nor reason countenance ‘Monday Morning Quarterbacking’ in\n\nevaluating the appropriateness of a child’s placement.” S.S. ex rel. Schank v. Howard Road\n\nAcademy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1406711\"><a href=\"/opinion/1406711/ss-ex-rel-shank-v-howard-road-academy/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

An IEP “should be reasonably calculated to enable the\n\nchild to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 204. “An\n\nIEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective. In striving for ‘appropriateness,’ an IEP must take into\n\naccount what was, and was not, objectively reasonable when the snapshot was taken, that is at\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fthe time the IEP was promulgated.” Roland M. v.

See HOD 10/14/14 at 9. Mr. Walker does not challenge this finding. Instead, he asserts\n\nthat the IEP was inappropriate based on subsequent evidence, i.e., Dr. Wells July 22, 2014 letter\n\nand her testimony at the due process hearing. Because an IEP must be evaluated as of the date it\n\nwas created, the Hearing Officer erred when he relied on evidence that was not presented to the\n\nIEP Team. Based on the evidence presented to the IEP Team, the IEP was appropriate in June\n\n2014. 5 Id.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated above, the Court will grant the District of Columbia’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment [Dkt. 6], and judgment will be entered in favor of the District.\n\nThe October 14, 2014 Hearing Officer Decision will be affirmed in part and vacated in part as\n\nfollows: The HOD finding that the June 27, 2014 IEP was reasonably calculated to provide J.W.\n\nan adequate education at the time the IEP was formulated will be affirmed, and the $3,600\n\n\n\n5\n  Residential placement may be necessary to provide a student a FAPE under the IDEA. To\ndetermine whether a residential placement is appropriate, a court must analyze “whether full time\nplacement may be considered necessary for educational purposes, or whether the residential\nplacement is a response to medical, social or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process.” McKenzie v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457815\"><a href=\"/opinion/457815/floretta-mckenzie-superintendent-dc-public-schools-v-christopher-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1534 (D.C. Cir. 1985). “Residential\nplacement may be necessary when the disabled child needs a highly structured environment in\norder to obtain any kind of educational benefit. . . . School districts are not, however, financially\nresponsible for the placement of students who need twenty-four-hour supervision for medical,\nsocial, or emotional reasons, and receive only an incidental educational benefit from that\nplacement.” Munir v.
