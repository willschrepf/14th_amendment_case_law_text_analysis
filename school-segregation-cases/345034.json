Mr. Townsend contends that the state's use of community-based services to provide essential long term care to some disabled Medicaid recipients but not others violates Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and a Department of Justice regulation implementing the ADA and mandating that public entities administer and deliver government services to qualified disabled persons in \"the most integrated setting\" possible. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132; 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that the Secretary's refusal to offer community-based in-home nursing services to some disabled persons may violate the ADA, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Secretary. In consideration of the Secretary's arguments that extending eligibility for in-home nursing services to all the state's disabled Medicaid recipients may fundamentally alter the state's Medicaid program, not addressed by the district court, we remand this case for further factual findings and development of the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Medicaid in Washington State</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal Medicaid program \"provid[es] federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.\" <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980). Participation by states in the Medicaid program is optional, but a state receiving Medicaid funds must comply with the requirements of the Medicaid Act. <i>Id.; see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a. An exception to this rule is the Medicaid waiver program, under which the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to waive certain Medicaid requirements for innovative or experimental state health care programs. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396n; 42 C.F.R. &#167; 430.25(b). The programs encouraged by the waiver program include increased provision of home and community based health care to Medicaid recipients who would otherwise qualify for nursing home care. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396n(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Medicaid Act groups needy persons into two categories, usually distinguished by income level: the \"categorically needy\" and the \"medically needy.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 C.F.R. &#167; 435.4; <i>Schweiker v. Hogan,</i> 457 U.S. 569, 572-73, 102 S.Ct. 2597, 73 L.Ed.2d 227 (1982). A participating state must provide certain types of services to categorically needy persons. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396d(a)(1)-(5), (17), (21). For medically needy persons, the state is only obligated to establish \"reasonable standards\" consistent with the purposes of the Medicaid Act for determining the extent of assistance it will offer. <i>Beal v. Doe,</i> 432 U.S. 438, 441, 97 S.Ct. 2366, 53 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(17).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Washington receives Medicaid funding and funds the provision of long-term medical care and living assistance in nursing home settings to both the categorically and the medically needy. Categorically needy Washington state residents, however, have the additional option of receiving long-term living assistance and medical care in their own homes or adult family homes in the community through a Medicaid waiver program: Community Options Program Entry Services (\"COPES\"). Medically needy persons must receive Medicaid-funded long term living and medical assistance in a nursing home setting or not at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Plaintiffs and Procedural History of this Case</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levi Townsend, the lead plaintiff in this case, is in his eighties, has diabetic peripheral vascular disease, and is a bilateral amputee. In addition to medical treatment, he requires assistance preparing meals, performing housework, bathing, dressing, and attending to other personal hygiene needs. Mr. Townsend is eligible for Medicaid services administered by DSHS because he is a person with a limited income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before July 1999, Mr. Townsend's income placed him among the \"categorically needy\" who qualified for COPES assistance. Rather than move to a nursing home, Mr. Townsend chose to receive COPES services in a community-based adult family home setting. This arrangement enabled Mr. Townsend to remain in his own community, near friends and family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Washington, persons whose income is at or below three-hundred percent of the Social Security Income Federal Benefit Rate (\"SSI FBR\") are deemed categorically needy. <i>See</i> Wash. Admin. Code &#167; 388-513-1301. In July 1999, Mr. Townsend's income increased to approximately forty-six dollars above three hundred percent of the SSI FBR. This increase meant that Mr. Townsend was no longer \"categorically needy,\" but, instead, only \"medically needy.\" DSHS informed Mr. Townsend that he would have to move to a nursing home within 30 days or lose his Medicaid benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Mr. Townsend filed suit on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated Medicaid recipients certified by the district court, seeking to enjoin the requirement that he move to a nursing home as a condition of receiving needed, available Medicaid services. Mr. Townsend alleged that DSHS's denial of community-based long term care to medically needy disabled persons violated the ADA by (1) discriminating on the basis of disability; and (2) contravening the principles expressed in <i>Olmstead v. L.C.,</i> 527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999), and the ADA's \"integration regulation,\" which require that public entities administer services \"in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment for the DSHS Secretary. The court held that the exclusion of medically needy persons from COPES did not discriminate on the basis of Medicaid recipients' disability, but instead permissibly allocated services according to recipients' income levels. Characterizing COPES as a distinct program through which \"Washington state has sought to provide additional services for the most needy individuals,\" the court further held that modifying the income-based restrictions on COPES eligibility for disabled medically needy persons would \"fundamentally alter\" the program by \"merging the two distinct classes of categorically needy and medically needy individuals.\" Because the ADA ordinarily does not require fundamental alterations to state programs, the court found that exclusion of medically needy disabled persons from COPES did not violate the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to plaintiffs' separate argument that the Secretary was violating the ADA's integration mandate by not providing services to medically needy disabled persons in the most integrated setting possible, the court relied on <i>Rodriguez v. City of New York,</i> 197 F.3d 611 (2d Cir.1999), in which the Second Circuit stated that the ADA does not require the state to provide services that it does not already provide to the disabled. In the court's view, requiring the state to provide long term care in community-based settings as well as nursing homes would mean developing and funding a new program of services for the disabled. The court concluded that \"because Washington state does not provide community-based programs to the medically needy, the integration mandate does not require their creation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Townsend appeals the court's grant of summary judgment on his claim that the state's failure to provide long-term care to the medically needy disabled in a community-based setting violates the ADA principles expressed in <i>Olmstead</i> and the integration regulation implementing those principles. He does not appeal the grant of summary judgment on his claim that exclusion from COPES discriminated against class members on the basis of disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The ADA's Integration Mandate</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In adopting the ADA, Congress recognized that \"historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem,\" and that \"individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, ... failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, ... [and] segregation.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(2), (5). Congress aimed to eliminate this unjustified segregation and isolation of disabled persons through, among other provisions of the ADA, Title II, which provides that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Justice's integration regulation implements the isolation and segregation concerns that, in part, underlie Title II. The regulation states: \"A public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified persons with disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(d). Another regulation provides: \"A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(b)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Olmstead v. L.C.,</i> the Supreme Court applied the integration and anti-isolation principles, interpreting discrimination forbidden under Title II of the ADA to include \"[u]njustified isolation of the disabled.\" <i>Olmstead,</i> 527 U.S. at 597, 119 S.Ct. 2176. <i>Olmstead</i> held that Georgia's practice of institutionalizing mentally disabled persons rather than providing them with community-based treatment would violate the ADA unless Georgia could demonstrate that modifying state programs to provide community-based care would fundamentally alter the nature of the services it offered the mentally disabled. The Court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognition that unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination reflects two evident judgments. First, institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.... Second, confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 600-01, 119 S.Ct. 2176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of the integration regulation, coupled with the reasoning and holding of <i>Olmstead,</i> direct our analysis in this case. To prove that a public service or program violates Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must show \"(1) he is a `qualified individual with a disability'; (2) he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity's services, programs, or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of his disability.\" <i>Duvall v. County of Kitsap,</i> 260 F.3d 1124, 1135 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that Mr. Townsend is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. As a person within the \"medically needy\" category of Medicaid recipients, Mr. Townsend is qualified to receive long-term medical care and living assistance through Washington's Medicaid program. As shown by Mr. Townsend's benefit from, and preference for, receiving this care through the COPES program, community-based services are appropriate for his needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Olmstead,</i> the Supreme Court interpreted the failure to provide Medicaid services in a community-based setting as a form of discrimination on the basis of disability. When a state's policies discriminate against the disabled in violation of the ADA, the ADA's regulations mandate reasonable modifications to those policies in order to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, at least when such modification would not fundamentally alter the nature of the services provided by the state. <i>Lovell v. Chandler,</i> 303 F.3d 1039, 1054 (9th Cir.2002) (citing <i>Crowder v. Kitagawa,</i> 81 F.3d 1480 (9th Cir.1996)). Because DSHS does not allow Mr. Townsend to receive the services for which he is qualified in a community-based, rather than nursing home, setting, Mr. Townsend can prove that the Secretary has violated Title II of the ADA, unless the Secretary can demonstrate that provision of community-based services to Mr. Townsend and members of the class would fundamentally alter the nature of the services DSHS provides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied on <i>Rodriguez v. City of New York,</i> 197 F.3d 611 (2d Cir. 1999) to distinguish this case from <i>Olmstead.</i> In <i>Rodriguez,</i> a class of Medicaid recipients challenged New York's failure to provide safety monitoring services as part of its Medicaid program providing personal care services (such as assistance bathing, dressing, and toileting) to financially needy disabled individuals. <i>Id.</i> at 613-14. The <i>Rodriguez</i> court found that the plaintiff class was demanding a separate service, one not already provided by the City, and that \"[t]he ADA requires only that a particular service provided to some not be denied to disabled people.... New York cannot have unlawfully discriminated against appellees by denying a benefit that it provides to no one.\" <i>Id.</i> at 618. The <i>Rodriguez</i> court found <i>Olmstead</i> inapposite because \"[i]n <i>Olmstead,</i> the parties disputed only &#8212; and the Court addressed only &#8212; <i>where</i> Georgia should provide treatment, not <i>whether</i> it must provide it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 619 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reliance on <i>Rodriguez</i> in support of its determination that Mr. Townsend is requesting new benefits not currently provided by the state's Medicaid program is misplaced. As <i>Rodriguez</i> makes clear, where the issue is the <i>location</i> of services, not <i>whether</i> services will be provided, <i>Olmstead</i> controls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the precise issue is not whether the state must provide the long term care services sought by Mr. Townsend and the class members &#8212; the state is already providing these services &#8212; but in what location these services will be provided. Mr. Townsend simply requests that the services he is already eligible to receive under an existing state program (assistance in dressing, bathing, preparing meals, taking medications, and so on) be provided in the community-based adult home where he lives, rather than the nursing home setting the state requires. <i>See Helen L. v. DiDario,</i> 46 F.3d 325, 337-39 (3d Cir.1995) (state violated the ADA's integration mandate by not providing state-funded attendant care services for which plaintiff was eligible in her own home, rather than a nursing home).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Characterizing community-based provision of services as a new program of services not currently provided by the state fails to account for the fact that the state is already providing those very same services. If services were determined to constitute distinct programs based solely on the location in which they were provided, <i>Olmstead</i> and the integration regulation would be effectively gutted. States could avoid compliance with the ADA simply by characterizing services offered in one isolated location as a program distinct from the provision of the same services in an integrated location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the language of the statute and of the integration regulation and the Supreme Court's mandate and reasoning in <i>Olmstead,</i> we conclude that DSHS is in violation of Title II of the ADA by failing to provide long term care services it currently provides to medically needy disabled persons in integrated settings, unless it can show that providing services in community-based settings would fundamentally alter the nature of the services it currently dispenses to medically needy Medicaid recipients in Washington.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Fundamental Alteration</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the language of Title II and the integration regulation that public entities are not required to create new programs that provide heretofore unprovided services to assist disabled persons. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 197 F.3d 611; <i>see also Alexander v. Choate,</i> 469 U.S. 287, 303, 105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985) (\"Medicaid programs do not guarantee that each recipient will receive that level of health care precisely tailored to his or her particular needs.... [T]he benefit provided remains the individual services offered &#8212; not `adequate health care.'\") Nor, ordinarily, must public entities make modifications that would fundamentally alter existing programs and services administered pursuant to policies that do not facially discriminate against the disabled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A public entity shall make <i>reasonable modifications</i> in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, <i>unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(b)(7) (emphasis added). As the regulatory language makes clear, entities are required only to make <i>reasonable</i> changes in existing policies in order to accommodate individuals' disabilities. <i>Olmstead,</i> 527 U.S. at 603, 119 S.Ct. 2176. Plaintiffs do not challenge the applicability of a fundamental alteration defense in this case, so we assume it applies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary contends that a decision that the state must offer community-based long term care services to disabled medically needy persons would fundamentally alter Congress's and the state legislature's considered policy decisions to provide long term care services to medically needy persons only in nursing homes. But policy choices that isolate the disabled cannot be upheld solely because offering integrated services would change the segregated way in which existing services are provided. <i>Olmstead</i> makes that clear, for precisely that alteration was at issue in <i>Olmstead,</i> and <i>Olmstead</i> did not regard the transfer of services to a community setting, without more, as a <i>fundamental</i> alteration. Indeed, such a broad reading of fundamental alteration regulation would render the protection against isolation of the disabled substanceless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Secretary's argument fails to account for the explicit policy preferences for home- and community-based care contained in recent federal and state Medicaid statutes. Through the Medicaid waiver program, Congress has encouraged states to experiment with providing medical care in community &#8212; and home-based settings for the categorically needy. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396n(c); <i>cf. Olmstead,</i> 527 U.S. at 601, 119 S.Ct. 2176. In addition, the Washington state legislature has itself declared that \"the public interest would best be served by a broad array of long-term care services that support persons who need such services at home or in the community whenever practicable and that promote individual autonomy, dignity, and choice.\" Wash. Rev.Code &#167; 74.39A.005. In recognition of these important goals, the Washington legislature has taken steps to establish a Medicaid waiver program through which some medically needy persons may receive the same sort of community-based services provided only to the categorically needy under the current COPES program. <i>See</i> Wash. Rev.Code &#167; 74.39.041(1).

At the same time, even if extension of community-based long term care services to the medically needy were to generate greater expenses for the state's Medicaid program, it is unclear whether these extra costs would, in fact, compel cutbacks in services to other Medicaid recipients. <i>See Olmstead,</i> 527 U.S. at 604, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (\"Sensibly construed, the fundamental-alteration component of the reasonable-modifications regulation would allow the State to show that, in the allocation of available resources, immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot tell on the present record whether the concerns raised by the Secretary are valid ones.

The court's opinion to the contrary effectively submerges several sections of the Medicaid Act under the perceived force of the integration mandate. Today's opinion casts aside the conscious choices Congress made in permitting, but not requiring, states to provide community care for the benefit of the disabled. Under <i>Traynor</i> this result is to be avoided if an alternate approach would continue to give effect to both the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Medicaid Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Recognizing that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not address the state of Washington's <i>initial</i> decision whether or not to create a community care program provides just such an alternate approach. Recognizing limits on the ADA in the community care context still leaves the ADA with significant force in regulating the provision of community care to the disabled. Once a state decides to offer community care to a given Medicaid category, states must administer their community care waiver programs in a manner that complies with the integration mandate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> Following <i>Traynor's</i> requirement that we adopt the interpretation that gives a narrow statute like the Medicaid Act full meaning, I would conclude that the ADA does not address Washington's discretion in creating community care programs as the Medicaid Act provides the governing principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Americans with Disabilities Act simply does not reach the question posed in this case, the state of Washington's refusal to create a community care program for medically needy disabled recipients is not discrimination based on disability.

The court held that the exclusion of medically needy persons from COPES did not discriminate on the basis of Medicaid recipients' disability, but instead permissibly allocated services according to recipients' income levels. Characterizing COPES as a distinct program through which \"Washington state has sought to provide additional services for the most needy individuals,\" the court further held that modifying the income-based restrictions on COPES eligibility for disabled medically needy persons would \"fundamentally alter\" the program by \"merging the two distinct classes of categorically needy and medically needy individuals.\" Because the ADA ordinarily does not require fundamental alterations to state programs, the court found that exclusion of medically needy disabled persons from COPES did not violate the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to plaintiffs' separate argument that the Secretary was violating the ADA's integration mandate by not providing services to medically needy disabled persons in the most integrated setting possible, the court relied on <i>Rodriguez v.

In the court's view, requiring the state to provide long term care in community-based settings as well as nursing homes would mean developing and funding a new program of services for the disabled.

[and] segregation.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(2), (5). Congress aimed to eliminate this unjustified segregation and isolation of disabled persons through, among other provisions of the ADA, Title II, which provides that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Justice's integration regulation implements the isolation and segregation concerns that, in part, underlie Title II. The regulation states: \"A public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified persons with disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(d). Another regulation provides: \"A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(b)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Olmstead v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2176</span></a></span>. <i>Olmstead</i> held that Georgia's practice of institutionalizing mentally disabled persons rather than providing them with community-based treatment would violate the ADA unless Georgia could demonstrate that modifying state programs to provide community-based care would fundamentally alter the nature of the services it offered the mentally disabled. The Court reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognition that unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination reflects two evident judgments. First, institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.... Second, confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 600-01, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To prove that a public service or program violates Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must show \"(1) he is a `qualified individual with a disability'; (2) he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity's services, programs, or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of his disability.\" <i>Duvall v.

As a person within the \"medically needy\" category of Medicaid recipients, Mr. Townsend is qualified to receive long-term medical care and living assistance through Washington's Medicaid program. As shown by Mr. Townsend's benefit from, and preference for, receiving this care through the COPES program, community-based services are appropriate for his needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Olmstead,</i> the Supreme Court interpreted the failure to provide Medicaid services in a community-based setting as a form of discrimination on the basis of disability. When a state's policies discriminate against the disabled in violation of the ADA, the ADA's regulations mandate reasonable modifications to those policies in order to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, at least when such modification would not fundamentally alter the nature of the services provided by the state. <i>Lovell v.

Because DSHS does not allow Mr. Townsend to receive the services for which he is qualified in a community-based, rather than nursing home, setting, Mr. Townsend can prove that the Secretary has violated Title II of the ADA, unless the Secretary can demonstrate that provision of community-based services to Mr. Townsend and members of the class would fundamentally alter the nature of the services DSHS provides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied on <i>Rodriguez v.

The <i>Rodriguez</i> court found that the plaintiff class was demanding a separate service, one not already provided by the City, and that \"[t]he ADA requires only that a particular service provided to some not be denied to disabled people....

He therefore believes that Washington must create a community care program for the disabled who fall within the medically needy category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state of Washington counters that the Medicaid Act does not require it to provide community care to <i>anyone</i> within the medically needy category. The state further contends that it would be unreasonable and a fundamental alteration of its Medicaid program to require the state to create an entirely new community care program for medically needy disabled individuals like Townsend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Townsend's claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act should not succeed. It is necessary to address the interaction between the Medicaid Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act to see why Townsend's claim fails. A proper reconciliation of these two statutes leads to the conclusion that Washington is not required by the Americans with Disabilities Act to provide community care coverage for disabled Medicaid recipients who fall into the medically needy classification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever two federal statutes may be in tension or conflict, we are required to reconcile the two statutes.

The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these instructions, we should conclude that Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act cannot require Washington to offer community care for disabled medically needy Medicaid recipients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Medicaid Act establishes a comprehensive framework regulating the Medicaid program. It is a narrow statute that informs states about what medical services must be provided and what medical services are optional. The Medicaid Act also establishes procedural rules governing the provision of these services. Because the Medicaid Act is a narrow, comprehensive statute, we must apply the <i>Traynor</i> analysis in evaluating the impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act on the Medicaid Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Medicaid Act leaves the creation of community care programs to the broad discretion of the states.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> The only significant limitation on this discretion is that states are forbidden from creating community care programs for the disabled without prior federal approval.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> There is no statute or regulation that requires states to create community care programs. Community care is the only form of long term care that the Medicaid Act does not require under any set of circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> A requirement that states provide community care programs to the disabled is inconsistent with the Medicaid Act's text and structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Congress consciously chose not to link community care for the disabled to the provision of nursing home care.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> In the same legislation that established the community care waiver program, Congress made the coverage of home care mandatory for any Medicaid group that receives coverage for nursing home care.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> At that time Congress opted merely to encourage the creation of community care programs and to do so without regard to the existence or non-existence of nursing home care programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> Congress has not seen fit to replace the waiver program with a mandatory requirement over the course of the last two decades, leaving the waiver program's optional approach to community care programs for the disabled in force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying <i>Traynor,</i> the Americans with Disabilities Act should not transform Washington's exercise of congressionally-conferred discretion into discrimination. The court's opinion to the contrary effectively submerges several sections of the Medicaid Act under the perceived force of the integration mandate. Today's opinion casts aside the conscious choices Congress made in permitting, but not requiring, states to provide community care for the benefit of the disabled. Under <i>Traynor</i> this result is to be avoided if an alternate approach would continue to give effect to both the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Medicaid Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Recognizing that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not address the state of Washington's <i>initial</i> decision whether or not to create a community care program provides just such an alternate approach. Recognizing limits on the ADA in the community care context still leaves the ADA with significant force in regulating the provision of community care to the disabled. Once a state decides to offer community care to a given Medicaid category, states must administer their community care waiver programs in a manner that complies with the integration mandate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> Following <i>Traynor's</i> requirement that we adopt the interpretation that gives a narrow statute like the Medicaid Act full meaning, I would conclude that the ADA does not address Washington's discretion in creating community care programs as the Medicaid Act provides the governing principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Americans with Disabilities Act simply does not reach the question posed in this case, the state of Washington's refusal to create a community care program for medically needy disabled recipients is not discrimination based on disability. The state need not entertain Townsend's proposed modification to its Medicaid program because no modification is needed to \"avoid discrimination based on disability.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looked at another way, even if Washington's failure to create a community care program for the medically disabled could be considered discriminatory, Townsend's proposal, which requires the creation of a community care program, would not be a reasonable modification.
