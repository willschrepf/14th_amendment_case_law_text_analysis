In his complaint, Bonner contended that the appellees\nviolated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights while he was a pretrial\n\n\n       * Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH\nCIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 14-10179    Document: 00512947997    Page: 2   Date Filed: 02/25/2015\n\n\n                                No. 14-10179\n\ndetainee when, without a hearing, he was placed in administrative segregation\nand was required to wear restraints during his criminal trial. He also asserted\nthat his placement in administrative segregation and confinement in an\nunsanitary cell, where he was allegedly denied certain privileges and was\nprevented from contacting his family and attorney, violated the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments.       Finally, he contended that his administrative\nsegregation and placement in restraints violated his equal protection rights.\n      The district court determined that Bonner’s claims concerning his\nconfinement in an unsanitary cell and the denial of privileges and contact with\nfamily and counsel were unexhausted. The district court held further that,\nbecause Bonner failed to present evidence of constitutional violations, the\nappellees were entitled to qualified immunity on his remaining claims.\n      We review a district court’s order granting a Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo, using the same\nstandards applied to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. In re Great Lakes\nDredge & Dock Co., 624 F.3d 201, 209-10 (5th Cir. 2010). “The court shall grant\nsummary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to\nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\nFED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). When, as here, the defendant officials plead qualified\nimmunity, the plaintiff bears the burden of rebutting the defense by\nestablishing a genuine dispute as to whether the officials’ conduct violated a\nconstitutional right of the plaintiff and whether that right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the violation. Brown v. Callahan, 623 F.3d 249, 253\n(5th Cir. 2010).\n      Bonner argues that the district court erred in finding that his claim\nregarding the unsanitary condition of his cell was unexhausted. Under the\nPLRA, “[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\f    Case: 14-10179    Document: 00512947997     Page: 3   Date Filed: 02/25/2015\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10179\n\nsection 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in\nany jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative\nremedies as are available are exhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Bonner did\nnot follow the required grievance process by presenting his allegations\nregarding the unsanitary condition of his cell in both steps of the Johnson\nCounty Jail two-step grievance process, and he consequently failed to exhaust\nthat process. See Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90 (2006).\n      With regard to his claim regarding his placement in administrative\nsegregation, this court has held that “absent extraordinary circumstances,\nadministrative segregation as such, being an incident to the ordinary life as a\nprisoner, will never be a ground for a constitutional claim.” Pichardo v. Kinker,\n73 F.3d 612, 612-13 (5th Cir. 1996).        The summary judgment evidence\nestablished that Bonner was moved to administrative segregation out of a\nconcern for his safety due to the nature of the charges against him and his\nimpending trial and for the legitimate penological concerns of jail security. See\nMcCord v. Maggio, 910 F.2d 1248, 1251 (5th Cir. 1990).\n      Bonner avers that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his\nsafety when they placed him in administrative segregation. This deliberate\nindifference claim and attendant specific factual allegations are raised for the\nfirst time on appeal; the claim is not considered. See Stewart Glass & Mirror,\nInc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Centers, Inc., 200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.\n2000). To the extent that Bonner made any allegations in the district court\nconcerning deliberate indifference, his contentions did not show that prison\nofficials “knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to [his] health or safety.”\nGibbs v. Grimmette, 254 F.3d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 2001).\n      Bonner’s claim regarding his placement in restraints is without merit.\nThe summary judgment evidence showed that Tony Ray was not personally\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\f    Case: 14-10179    Document: 00512947997     Page: 4   Date Filed: 02/25/2015\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10179\n\ninvolved in the decision to place him in restraints. See Johnson v. Dallas\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 38 F.3d 198, 200 (5th Cir. 1994). Although Bob Alford\nrecommended to the trial court that Bonner be fitted with restraints due to the\nnature of the charges pending against him and security concerns that existed\nas a result of these charges, the ultimate decision to place Bonner in restraints\nremained with the trial court. See United States v. Fields, 483 F.3d 313, 356-\n57 (5th Cir. 2007). Accordingly, this claim is not legally supportable against\nAlford.\n      We also find without merit Bonner’s equal protection claim. Bonner\nfailed to state a “class of one” equal protection claim because his allegations\ndid not identify any similarly situated prisoners, nor did his allegations show\nthat he was intentionally treated differently from any other prisoners absent\na rational basis. See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564-65\n(2000).\n      Because Bonner has failed to show that the appellees violated a clearly\nestablished constitutional right, the appellees were entitled to qualified\nimmunity on Bonner’s claims. See Lytle v. Bexar County, Tex., 560 F.3d 404,\n409 (5th Cir. 2009). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f",
