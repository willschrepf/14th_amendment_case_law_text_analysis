Vukovich\nHon. Gene Donofrio\n\n\n                                                         Dated: March 31, 2010\n\n        DEGENARO, Judge.\n\f                                                                                          -2-\n\n\n       {¶ 1} This timely appeal comes for consideration upon the record in the trial\n\ncourt, the parties' briefs, and their oral arguments before this court. Appellant, Michael\nKaufman, appeals the March 25, 2008 decision of the Mahoning County Court of\nCommon Pleas that sentenced him to five consecutive life sentences and four\nconsecutive five-year sentences, subsequent to a jury finding him guilty of four counts\nof rape, four counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual\npenetration.\n       {¶ 2} Kaufman argues on appeal that his convictions were against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence and that the force specifications for his rape convictions were\nbased on insufficient evidence. Kaufman also contends that the trial court provided\nimproper jury instructions, erroneously allowed irrelevant expert testimony, improperly\nprovided assistance to the state, and limited Kaufman's right to cross-examine a\nwitness. Kaufman further contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying\nhis motion to continue, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, and\nthat the state committed prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, Kaufman argues that the\ntrial court erroneously allowed the improper joinder of victims and offenses.\n       {¶ 3} The force specifications for Kaufman's rape convictions were based on\n\nsufficient evidence under State v. Eskridge (1988), 33 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304.\nAlthough the evidence supporting Kaufman's convictions was not terribly strong given\nthe weakened credibility of one of the victims, his convictions were not against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence. The trial court's decisions regarding jury instructions,\nadmission of expert testimony, and limitation of cross-examination were proper.\nKaufman did not demonstrate that the state's objectionable statements deprived him of\nhis right to a fair trial. Finally, the trial court's decision not to sever the charges against\nKaufman for the two separate victims was an abuse of discretion, where the testimony\n\f                                                                                     -3-\n\n\nof each victim would not have been admissible in separate trials under Evid.R. 404(B),\nand the offenses committed against each victim were too similar and inflammatory to\nrealistically avoid fostering the erroneous belief that the distinct offenses corroborated\none another. Kaufman's remaining assignments of error regarding assistance to the\nstate, denial of motions to continue ,and ineffective assistance of counsel are moot.\n      {¶ 4} Accordingly, the trial court's decision will be reversed and remanded for\n\nnew trials.\n                            Facts and Procedural History\n      {¶ 5} On November 1, 2007, a grand jury indicted Kaufman on eight counts of\n\nrape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b); five counts of gross sexual imposition, in\nviolation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4); and one count of felonious sexual penetration, in\nviolation of R.C. 2907.12(A)(1)(b). The counts encompassed offenses against three\ndifferent victims, JB, DC, and KC. JB was born on October 4, 1987, DC was born on\nApril 22, 1991, and KC was born on December 21, 1992, and all victims were minors\nunder the age of 13 at the time of the indicted offenses.\n      {¶ 6} Kaufman was charged with committing offenses against the three victims\n\nas follows: For offenses against victim JB between October 4, 1995, and October 3,\n1998, Kaufman was charged with three of the counts of rape, three counts of gross\nsexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual penetration. For offenses against\nvictim DC between January 1, 2002, and September 7, 2002, Kaufman was charged\nwith one count of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition. For offenses against\nvictim KC between January 1, 2001, and August 31, 2003, Kaufman was charged with\nthe remaining four counts of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition.\n      {¶ 7} On November 7, 2007, Kaufman entered a plea of not guilty, and the trial\n\ncourt appointed John B. Juhasz as counsel after finding Kaufman to be indigent. The\n\f                                                                                     -4-\n\n\ntrial court scheduled the trial for December 17, 2007. On December 6, 2007, Kaufman\nfiled a motion to continue, noting that counsel had sustained a back injury on\nNovember 13, 2007, and that counsel for the state had failed to complete its responses\nto discovery requests. The trial court granted Kaufman's motion and the trial was\nrescheduled to take place on January 7, 2008. On December 20, 2007, Kaufman filed\nanother motion to continue due to a conflict with another trial. The trial court\nrescheduled the trial to January 22, 2008. On January 9, 2008, the parties filed a joint\nmotion for continuance due to scheduling conflicts, which the trial court overruled. On\nJanuary 16, 2008, Kaufman filed another motion to continue, stating that counsel's\nback injury, untimely discovery responses from the state, and investigation difficulties\nrendered counsel unable to provide effective assistance of counsel at such a close trial\ndate. During a January 18, 2008 hearing on Kaufman's motion, the trial court asked\ndefense counsel to pick a continuance date well in the future in order to ensure that\nsuch time constraints would not cause any further problems with this trial. The trial\ncourt granted Kaufman's motion and continued the trial to March 17, 2008.\n      {¶ 8} On February 19, 2008, the state filed a supplemental disclosure of\n\nevidence regarding a fourth victim, RT, not included in the indictment. On March 3,\n2008, Kaufman filed a motion for relief from prejudicial joinder, asking for three\nseparate trials for the three separate victims. Kaufman also filed another motion to\ncontinue the trial. The trial court overruled the motion to continue and set a hearing for\nthe motion for relief from prejudicial joinder. Additionally, Kaufman filed a motion to\ndismiss charges 7, 8, and 11 for lack of jurisdiction, because the offenses were alleged\nto have occurred outside of Mahoning County. The state filed a motion to introduce\nevidence of other acts, requesting that the trial court allow testimony from RT, the\nvictim not included in the indictment.\n\f                                                                                  -5-\n\n\n      {¶ 9} Subsequent to a hearing on March 11, 2008, the trial court denied\n\nKaufman's request to sever trials and denied the state's motion to admit other acts\nevidence regarding the fourth victim. The trial court sustained Kaufman's motion to\ndismiss three of the charges, which left 11 charges against two victims remaining on\nthe indictment. Kaufman repeated his request for severance throughout his trial, but\neach request was overruled.\n      {¶ 10} On March 12, 2008, the state filed a motion in limine, asking the trial\n\ncourt to allow KC to testify about acts that had occurred outside the trial court's\njurisdiction. On March 13, 2008, Kaufman filed a supplemental motion to continue,\nrepeating his request for an enlarged amount of time to prepare. The trial court\noverruled both motions.\n      {¶ 11} On March 17, 2008, the state filed a second motion in limine, asking the\n\ntrial court to disallow any reference to a 1993 report by JB's mother of suspected\nsexual abuse of JB by an unspecified person and a 2000 report that JB had molested his\nlittle brother, RT, which the trial court sustained. The state filed a third motion in\nlimine, asking to admit the testimony of DC (the third victim in the dismissed counts)\nas other-acts evidence and asking that KC be permitted to testify about acts not\nincluded in the indictment for the purpose of explaining the background behind the\noffenses actually charged. The trial court disallowed the other-acts evidence of DC,\nbut sustained the state's motion regarding KC.\n      {¶ 12} During the course of the proceedings, the trial court dismissed Counts 1\n\nand 13, due to errors in the indictment. Pursuant to Kaufman's motion, the indictment\nwas amended to renumber the remaining nine counts. The counts remaining were as\nfollows: For offenses against victim JB between October 4, 1995, and October 3,\n1998, Kaufman was charged with two of the counts of rape, three counts of gross\n\f                                                                                     -6-\n\n\nsexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual penetration (Counts 1 through 5\nand 9); and for offenses against victim KC between January 1, 2002, and August 31,\n2003, Kaufman was charged with two counts of rape and one count of gross sexual\nimposition (Counts 6 through 8). During proceedings, the state successfully moved the\ntrial court to provide an Eskridge definition of force in the jury instructions and to\ninclude the additional finding of force or threat of force for each of the rape and\nfelonious-sexual-penetration charges. See Eskridge, 38 Ohio St.3d at 58.\n      {¶ 13} At trial, the state presented the testimony of KC, Karen, JB, Officer\n\nSuzanne Doni-Ellis, and Dr. Paul McPherson. Kaufman presented his own testimony\nand the testimony of Officer Doug Flara, Donna, and Tracey. An initial explanation\nof the parties' relationships with each other will clarify the parties' testimony.\n      {¶ 14} Tracey was married to Frederick from approximately 1987 to 1991. The\n\ncouple had a son, JB, on October 4, 1987. Tracey was married to Reginald from\napproximately 1995 to 1999, though they gave birth to a son, RT, in 1994. Reginald\nworked at Long Bar Trucking (“LBT”). Kaufman also worked at LBT, starting in\n1991. Tracey and Kaufman were married in 2001 and had a son in 2005. Kaufman's\nmother, Donna, lives in Boardman. Donna's sister, Karen, lives in Wisconsin, but\nvisited Donna in Boardman during most summers. On past visits to Donna, Karen\nwould bring her grandchildren and step-grandchildren along, one of whom is KC, born\nDecember 21, 1992.\n      {¶ 15} KC testified that he met Kaufman when Kaufman was visiting family in\n\nWisconsin in 2002 and that he saw Kaufman three other times during KC's short visits\nto Donna's house in Ohio during the summers of 2002 to 2004.\n      {¶ 16} KC testified that he and other family members met up with Kaufman in\n\nthe early summer of 2002 and stayed in a motel together, with the males staying in one\n\f                                                                                  -7-\n\n\nroom and the females in another room. KC testified that as he was getting out of\nKaufman's car in a parking lot of the motel, he scratched the car next to him with the\ndoor of Kaufman's car. KC stated that Kaufman \"said that he would call the sheriff\nand tell them that I scratched the car next to me, or I could receive punishment.\"\nDuring that night at the motel, Kaufman woke KC and \"said it was time for the\npunishment,\" by which he meant performing oral sex on Kaufman. KC also stated that\nhe did not tell anyone what happened at that time because he was scared that Kaufman\n\"might do something\" or get KC in trouble for scratching the car.\n      {¶ 17} During the summer of 2002 and 2003, when KC was in Ohio visiting\n\nextended family at Donna's house, Kaufman would get KC alone and continue the\n\"punishment,\" which involved striking KC's testicles, digitally penetrating KC's anus,\nor performing fellatio on one another. There were eight or nine people, along with two\nlarge dogs, staying in Donna's house during KC's family visits. KC testified that\nKaufman got KC alone in the attic, the basement, or the second floor bathroom in order\nto commit the abuse. On cross-examination, KC stated that he did not remember\nKaufman locking any doors when they were in the basement or the attic, but he\nremembered Kaufman locking the second-story bathroom door.\n      {¶ 18} KC testified to three or more incidents of Kaufman striking his testicles,\n\ntwo instances of digital-anal penetration, two instances of Kaufman performing fellatio\non KC, and one instance of KC performing fellatio on Kaufman in 2002. KC also\ntestified that Kaufman once used a hand-held video recorder to tape KC in the garage\nwhile Kaufman was touching KC's penis. KC testified to two instances of Kaufman\nstriking his testicles, one instance of digital-anal penetration, and two instances of\nfellatio in 2003.\n      {¶ 19} KC testified that at first, he did not tell anyone about what Kaufman did\n\f                                                                                     -8-\n\n\nduring the summer incidents because KC was scared and did not want to get in trouble.\nShortly before the family's summer 2004 visit, KC told his step-siblings about the\nabuse.\n         {¶ 20} KC testified that during the summer 2004 visit, Kaufman asked KC if he\n\nhad told anyone about their sexual interactions and that Kaufman \"seemed kind of\nangry.\" KC denied telling anyone because he was afraid of what Kaufman would do.\nKC and his step-brother, JT, took a tape recorder from Karen and Donna and used it to\ntry to catch an instance of Kaufman's abuse, but the adults repeatedly found the\nrecorder and took it back. JT told Karen about the abuse during this visit, and Karen\ntook the grandchildren back to Wisconsin.\n         {¶ 21} On cross-examination, KC testified that Kaufman did not threaten to hurt\n\nhim. KC testified that Karen was the adult in charge of him during the summer trips to\nDonna's house, not Kaufman, and that KC called Kaufman \"Uncle Mikey.\" However,\nKC also testified that Kaufman was an authority figure in Donna's house.\n         {¶ 22} KC testified that Kaufman had been driving a red Firebird during his 2002\n\ntrip to Wisconsin. When asked about the purpose of Kaufman's Wisconsin visit, which\nwas to pick up furniture from Kaufman's recently deceased grandmother, KC agreed\nthat Kaufman would not be able to move a lot of furniture in a Firebird. KC stated that\nhe did not remember what car Kaufman was driving when KC scratched the car door in\nthe parking lot of the motel. KC did not remember Tracey's presence during the 2002\nWisconsin trip.\n         {¶ 23} When KC was interviewed by social workers in Wisconsin after the 2004\n\ndisclosure, he did not tell them about the video-taping incident in the garage of Donna's\nhouse.\n         {¶ 24} Karen testified that she would visit her sister, Donna, in Ohio during\n\f                                                                                    -9-\n\n\nsummer breaks from school and that she brought KC along in 2002 to 2004. Karen\nbrought a tape recorder with her during the 2004 trip, and after it disappeared a few\ntimes, one of the grandchildren disclosed Kaufman's abuse of KC. The adults\nconfronted Kaufman about the abuse, and Kaufman denied the allegations.\n      {¶ 25} On cross-examination, Karen described renting motel rooms for family\n\ngatherings in Wisconsin in February and April 2002, but did not remember whether the\nfamily had all stayed together in motel rooms during Kaufman's trip to Wisconsin to\npick up furniture. On redirect examination, Karen stated that when the family stayed at\na motel, they always had one room for the women and one room for the men.\n      {¶ 26} Kaufman did not live at or stay overnight at Donna's house when KC was\n\nvisiting, but he would spend time there with the family after work, during weekends,\nand sometimes in the morning. He would come over to the house by himself or with\nTracey. When describing the layout and sleeping arrangements at Donna's house,\nKaren noted that the door to the second-story bathroom did not shut all the way. Karen\ndescribed Donna's house as a little hectic when all the adults, children, and dogs are\nthere. Karen testified that she had authority over her grandchildren when she brought\nthem on the trips to Donna's house, but also stated that all of the adults were authority\nfigures for the children at Donna's house.\n      {¶ 27} JB, born October 4, 1987, testified that he and Kaufman were good\n\nfriends before Tracey and Kaufman \"got together.\" Tracey, Reginald, and Kaufman all\nworked at LBT, and Tracey became friends with Kaufman while Reginald was away\non truck-driving jobs. Tracey married Reginald when JB was six, divorced when JB\nwas ten, and married Kaufman when JB was fifteen.\n      {¶ 28} Tracey frequently sent JB to Kaufman's house to spend time with him.\n\nDuring those visits, Kaufman was the only adult in the house and was in charge of JB.\n\f                                                                                  - 10 -\n\n\nWhen JB stayed with Kaufman in south Youngstown, Kaufman would pick JB up at\nhis school in Niles. JB sometimes stayed with Kaufman only during the day, then\nstarted staying with him over weekends, and then overnights during the week.\n         {¶ 29} JB testified that his friendship with Kaufman became inappropriate when\n\nhe was approximately five or six years old. JB stated that inappropriate sexual conduct\nbegan when he was six or seven years old and physical abuse began when he was ten.\nKaufman began to digitally penetrate JB's anus starting at the age of eight, and did so\nat least once every three months, usually when JB was in Kaufman's bathroom.\nBetween the ages of eight and 11, JB estimated that Kaufman had digitally penetrated\nhis anus 12 to 14 times and had JB perform fellatio two times. JB specified that one\ninstance of fellatio happened in the spring of 1997 and the other during the fall of\n1998.\n         {¶ 30} On cross-examination, JB testified that Kaufman began to touch JB\n\ninappropriately around the age of six and that the first instance occurred at Donna's\nhouse. JB testified that he told his mother about Kaufman rubbing his buttocks right\nafterwards, but Tracey did nothing. JB also testified that Kaufman touched him\ninappropriately at age 11 while washing him after JB had broken his arm in a bicycle\naccident at a location in New Springfield, Ohio.\n         {¶ 31} JB testified that he only disclosed Kaufman's abuse recently because he\n\nwants to become comfortable with himself so that he can start his own family. JB did\nnot report the sexual abuse to anyone besides Tracey and the police, though he said that\nReginald was made aware of Kaufman's physical abuse of JB at some unspecified\npoint.\n         {¶ 32} JB first spoke with the police in November 2006 and made an official\n\nreport of sexual abuse to the police in June 2007, after having been out of Ohio. JB\n\f                                                                                    - 11 -\n\n\nadmitted that he did not report the instances of fellatio or the inappropriate touching in\nNew Springfield to the police and said that he did not feel comfortable reporting all of\nit. JB admitted that he had told the police that the inappropriate touching started at age\nfive rather than six, but said he had just given the police an approximate date and was\nvery ill during the reporting process. On further cross, JB agreed that the touching\nstarted at age five. JB stated that Kaufman began penetrating his anus when he was six\nor seven years old, at Kaufman's house on Berkshire in Youngstown. On further cross,\nJB agreed that no anal penetration occurred prior to 1997 (which would have been\nwhen he was nine and ten years old). On redirect, JB testified that Kaufman's\ninappropriate touching began at age five or six, anal penetration began at age eight, and\nthe sexual abuse stopped by the time JB was twelve.\n      {¶ 33} Officer Suzanne Doni-Ellis of the Youngstown Police Department\n\ntestified that JB filed a police report with her on June 4, 2007, and stated that\nKaufman's inappropriate touching began at age five, anal penetration began at age\neight, and the abuse stopped by the time JB was 11 or twelve. Ellis did not gather\nphysical evidence due to the remote dates of abuse. During her investigation, Ellis\nprocured reports from police departments in Boardman and Wisconsin regarding KC's\n2004 allegations.\n      {¶ 34} Dr. Paul McPherson was proffered by the state as an expert regarding\n\nallegations of sex abuse by children. McPherson did not interview the victims and\ntestified about his general academic knowledge and professional experience with child\nsexual-abuse victims. McPherson testified that it is common for child victims to delay\ndisclosure of the abuse or to partially disclose the abuse and that it is not common for\nanal penetration to result in permanent scars. Kaufman cross-examined McPherson on\nstatistics regarding false allegations and hypothetical questions about anal trauma.\n\f                                                                                - 12 -\n\n\n      {¶ 35} Once the state rested, Kaufman renewed his motion for relief from\n\nprejudicial joinder and entered a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, both of which the\ntrial court denied. For Kaufman's case in chief, Officer Doug Flara of the Boardman\nPolice Department Youth and Family Services Division testified that he received a\nreport of sexual abuse from the Milwaukee Department of Child Welfare regarding KC\nin 2004. Flara interviewed Donna and Kaufman and spoke with Jennifer (KC's step-\nmother) via telephone. Flara took the case to the prosecutor's office in 2004, but no\naction was taken on the case until JB's report in 2007.\n      {¶ 36} Donna testified that she moved to Boardman, Ohio in 1996 and lived in\n\nMichigan prior to that. Donna testified that Kaufman drove her up to Wisconsin for\nher mother's funeral (in February 2002) in her white Buick. Kaufman and KC were\nboth at the bereavement luncheon. Donna stayed up in Wisconsin to deal with her\nmother's estate, until Kaufman returned in late April 2002 with Tracey, in a moving\ntruck. After a group family dinner, Kaufman and Tracey drove KC and two other boys\nto the motel where they were staying. Donna testified that the family got two rooms\nand that Kaufman, Tracey, KC, and KC's step-brother slept in one room. The door\nbetween the two adjoining motel rooms was left open, and Donna did not notice\nanything strange that night.\n      {¶ 37} When Karen and the grandchildren came to visit Donna in the summers of\n\n2002 to 2004, eight people stayed at Donna's house, and additional people, including\nKaufman and Tracey, would spend time there during the day. Donna testified that the\nbathroom doors at her house could not shut due to mistakes made during remodeling.\nDuring the family visits to Donna's house in 2002 to 2004, Donna had not noticed any\nstrange behavior and was shocked by KC's allegations in 2004.\n      {¶ 38} Tracey testified that she was married to Frederick from 1987 to 1991, and\n\f                                                                                 - 13 -\n\n\nhad one child with him, JB. She had one child, RT, with Reginald in 1994 and was\nmarried to Reginald from 1995 to 1999.\n       {¶ 39} Tracey testified that she met Kaufman in early 1996 and that she began to\n\nwork for LBT in late 1996. Tracey testified that Kaufman met JB in the fall of 1997\nand that she would send JB to stay with Kaufman when she was having marital\ndifficulties with Reginald. JB did not report any abuse to her, and Tracey first found\nout about the abuse when JB made the police report in 2007. JB would stay with\nKaufman a few times a month, only on the weekends, and Kaufman never drove JB to\nschool in Niles.\n       {¶ 40} In 2000, Tracey moved in to Kaufman's house on Berkshire. Tracey\n\ntestified that the shower at Kaufman's house did not work and was never fixed. Tracey\nand Kaufman were married in 2001 and had a son in 2005.\n       {¶ 41} Tracey provided testimony identical to Donna's regarding the family trip\n\nto Wisconsin in late April 2002, though Tracey stated that the door between the two\nadjoining motel rooms did not stay open the entire time. Tracey stated that she got up\nduring the night at the motel and did not notice anything strange.\n       {¶ 42} In Tracey's description of the family visits to Donna's house in the\n\nsummers of 2002 to 2004, Tracey said that she stayed close to Kaufman the whole\ntime, because she did not know his family very well.\n       {¶ 43} Kaufman testified that he started working at LBT in 1991. He bought his\n\nhouse on Berkshire Drive in Youngstown in April 1996. Kaufman's exhibit 14, an\ninspection report on the Berkshire house, stated that there was one bathroom in the\nhouse, and that \"Shower head is damaged. Shower head replacement is recommended.\nNo water pressure to shower. (Repairs needed.)\" Kaufman never fixed the shower and\ntestified that it still does not work.\n\f                                                                                   - 14 -\n\n\n      {¶ 44} Kaufman testified that he met JB in the fall of 1997, when JB was nine or\n\nten. Kaufman testified that he still lived in Austintown when he first started spending\ntime with JB and would have JB stay the night one or two times a month. Kaufman\nhad a \"big brother/little brother\" relationship with JB from 1997 to 1999 and started to\nspend time with JB and Tracey \"as a family\" in 1999.\n      {¶ 45} Kaufman's testimony addressed JB's claim that Kaufman had touched him\n\ninappropriately after JB had broken his arm in a bicycle accident. Kaufman stated that\nthe bike accident occurred during a camping trip in Pennsylvania and that JB had never\nbeen to New Springfield, Ohio. Kaufman's testimony otherwise generally duplicated\nmost of the defense testimony already presented, and Kaufman denied ever having\ntouched either victim inappropriately.\n      {¶ 46} At the close of trial, Kaufman renewed his motions for acquittal and relief\n\nfrom prejudicial joinder, which the trial court denied. After a day of deliberations, the\njury returned a guilty verdict for each of the nine counts against Kaufman. On March\n24, 2008, the trial court held a sentencing hearing and imposed four consecutive life\nsentences for the rape convictions, an additional consecutive life sentence for the\nfelonious-sexual-penetration conviction, and four consecutive five-year sentences for\nthe gross-sexual-imposition convictions.\n      {¶ 47} Kaufman timely filed the present appeal, asserting ten assignments of\n\nerror. We will address Kaufman's assignments of error in an order that facilitates our\nanalysis of the issues raised therein.\n                                Insufficient Evidence\n      {¶ 48} In his fourth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 49} \"Appellant Was Denied Due Process and the Liberties Secured by the\n\nUnited States Constitution and Ohio Const. Art. I, §§ 1, 2, 10 and 16 When He Was\n\f                                                                                     - 15 -\n\n\nConvicted of the Life Offenses of Rape upon Insufficient Evidence.\"\n       {¶ 50} Kaufman argues that his special felony rape convictions were based on\n\ninsufficient evidence because the state did not provide proof of force.\n       {¶ 51} In reviewing a challenge of insufficient evidence, \"the inquiry is, after\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, whether any\nreasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" State v. Jenks (1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d\n492, superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds. The court does\nnot examine the credibility of the witnesses, nor does it weigh the evidence in this\nprocess. State v. Goff (1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 139, 694 N.E.2d 916. Sufficiency of\nthe evidence is a test of adequacy, used to determine whether the case may go to the\njury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter\nof law. State v. Thompkins (1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541, citing\nBlack's Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 1433. This is a burden of production, not of\npersuasion. Thompkins at 390. A reviewing court should not disturb the decision\nbelow unless it finds that reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by\nthe trier of fact. Jenks at 273.\n       {¶ 52} Kaufman was convicted of four counts of rape of a person under 13, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), the elements of which are not argued in this\nassignment of error. Pursuant to the version of R.C. 2907.02(B) in effect at the time of\nthe commission of the offenses, a conviction of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) is sentenced as\na first degree felony, but carries a mandatory life sentence if there is a finding that the\noffender \"purposely compels the victim to submit by force or threat of force.\"\n       {¶ 53} The force element is defined as follows: \"Force means any violence,\n\ncompulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or\n\f                                                                                    - 16 -\n\n\nthing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). Force or the threat of force \"can be inferred from the\ncircumstances surrounding sexual conduct.\" State v. Schaim (1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51,\n600 N.E.2d 661, at paragraph one of the syllabus. In order to make a finding of force\nunder R.C. 2907.02, \"some amount of force must be proven beyond that force inherent\nin the crime itself.\" State v. Dye (1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 695 N.E.2d 763.\nHowever, the Ohio Supreme Court has explained that the force necessary to commit\nrape depends upon the respective age, size, and strength of the parties and their relation\nto each other. Eskridge, 38 Ohio St.3d at 58, 526 N.E.2d 304. Thus, the context of the\nrape will also affect our inferences regarding the additional element of force or threats\nof force. In the case of a child victim, a person in a position of authority over the\nvictim can be convicted of rape with the force specification \"without evidence of\nexpress threat of harm or evidence of significant physical restraint.\" Dye at syllabus.\n      {¶ 54} Kaufman argues that his rape convictions were based on insufficient\n\nevidence because the state did not provide evidence that Kaufman had used force or\nthreats of force against either victim. Kaufman also contends that the inference of\npsychological force in Eskridge and Dye does not apply in this case because Kaufman\nwas not an authority or parent figure for either of the victims. Kaufman contends that\nhe was merely \"an adult who had met these boys.\"\n      {¶ 55} It is true that the law does not impute an authoritative relationship merely\n\nbecause the victim is a child and the defendant is an adult. See State v. Drayer, 10th\nDist. No. 03AP-1033, 2004-Ohio-5061, at ¶31, vacated on other grounds by State v.\nDrayer, 159 Ohio App.3d 189, 2004-Ohio-6120, 823 N.E.2d 492. However, an adult\nneed not be the child's parent in order to establish that the child felt obligated to obey\nhim. Dye, supra. In Dye, the defendant was merely the victim's neighbor, but there\nwas direct proof that the defendant was acting in loco parentis, as there was testimony\n\f                                                                                   - 17 -\n\n\nthat the victim's mother specifically instructed the victim to obey the defendant when in\nhis charge or else she would bring him home. Dye, 82 Ohio St.3d at 328-329. In other\ncases, the child's belief that he must obey the adult has been established even without\nspecific instruction from the victim's parent that the defendant was to be obeyed in\nplace of the parent. See, e.g., State v. Milam, 8th Dist. No. 86268, 2006-Ohio-4742\n(defendant was in a position of authority with regard to the victim because he was the\nfather of one of the victim's friends, the victim spent many nights at the defendant's\nhome, and the victim testified that the defendant was \"in charge\" of him while at the\ndefendant's home); State v. Haschenburger, 7th Dist. No. 05 MA 192, 2007-Ohio-1562\n(defendant manipulated his relationship as a family friend to condition the victim to\nthink that she should comply with his demands).\n      {¶ 56} In this case, Kaufman had a long-standing relationship with JB's mother,\n\nfirst as a friend, then live-in boyfriend, then husband, though the marriage occurred\nafter the dates of the charged offenses for JB. JB's mother testified that she would send\nJB to stay overnight at Kaufman's house when she was experiencing difficulties with\nher previous husband, Reginald. JB testified that he would have to obey Kaufman if\nKaufman told him what to do. JB did not respect Kaufman as an authority figure, but\nspecified that Kaufman was in charge when JB was in his care. JB stated that he was\nfrightened of Kaufman.\n      {¶ 57} In addition to ongoing incidents of sexual touching and digital-anal\n\npenetration, JB testified that on two specific occasions, during the time periods of each\nof rape counts, \"I was in the process of getting out of the shower, and [Kaufman]\ngrabbed me and pulled my head down * * * [and] I was forced to suck his penis.\" JB\nalso testified to a specific incident, during the time period of the second rape count,\nwhere Kaufman both physically assaulted JB and forcefully penetrated his anus for an\n\f                                                                                   - 18 -\n\n\nextended period of time, causing him to bleed.\n         {¶ 58} The foregoing testimony indicates that Kaufman was an authority figure\n\nto JB. He was repeatedly entrusted to care for JB by JB's mother, and JB felt obligated\nto obey Kaufman. The sexual acts occurred either while JB was under Kaufman's sole\nsupervision, or during a period when Kaufman was living with JB and his mother,\nTracey. JB repeatedly described being \"forced\" by Kaufman to perform sexual acts\nwith him and described at least one incident of Kaufman inflicting physical violence on\nJB in conjunction with a sexual act. The state therefore presented sufficient evidence\nthat Kaufman was in a position of authority over JB, that JB's will was overcome by\nfear or duress, and that JB's will was overcome on at least one occasion by physical\nviolence. Given the totality of the evidence presented by the state, reasonable minds\ncould conclude that the rape counts against JB were committed with force or threat of\nforce.\n         {¶ 59} As for the force specifications on Counts 6 and 8, Kaufman did not have a\n\nsimilar long-standing relationship with KC. KC testified that he had first met Kaufman\nwhen Kaufman was visiting in Wisconsin in 2002 and saw Kaufman three other times,\nduring KC's short visits to Kaufman's mother's house in Ohio during the summers of\n2002 to 2004. Kaufman's mother was KC's step-mother's aunt, and KC called Kaufman\n\"Uncle Mikey.\" KC testified that Kaufman was not one of the adults responsible for\ntelling KC what he could or could not do when he was staying at Kaufman's mother's\nhouse. However, KC also testified that Kaufman was an authority figure in Kaufman's\nmother's house. Kaufman did not live at or stay overnight at his mother's house when\nKC was there, but he would visit with the family after work or during weekends. KC's\nstep-grandmother, Karen, testified that \"all of the adults\" were the authority figures at\nDonna's house when the family got together there.\n\f                                                                                    - 19 -\n\n\n      {¶ 60} KC described the first incident in 2002 with Kaufman, which was outside\n\nthe jurisdiction of the trial court and not included in the counts in this case, but\nexplained the background of his relationship with Kaufman. KC testified that as he\nwas getting out of Kaufman's car in a parking lot of the motel where they were staying\nand scratched the car next to him with the door of Kaufman's car, Kaufman \"said that\nhe would call the sheriff and tell them that I scratched the car next to me, or I could\nreceive punishment [from Kaufman]. And I was scared because I didn't really want to\nbe in trouble with the police, so -- I was a little kid. I didn't know. And so I chose the\npunishment because I thought it would be a lot easier. I didn't know what it was.\"\nDuring that night at the motel, Michael woke KC and \"said it was time for the\npunishment,\" which was to perform oral sex on Kaufman. KC testified that he was\nafraid of Kaufman. KC also stated that he did not tell anyone what happened at that\ntime because he was scared that Kaufman \"might do something\" or get KC in trouble\nfor scratching the car.\n      {¶ 61} During the summer of 2002 and 2003, when KC was in Ohio visiting his\n\nextended family, Kaufman would get KC alone and continue the \"punishment,\" which\ninvolved striking KC's testicles, digitally penetrating KC's anus, or KC and Kaufman\nperforming fellatio on one another. KC testified that it was Kaufman who removed\nKC's pants during each incident. KC stated that he did what Kaufman said because he\nwas scared and did not want to get in trouble. KC also said that he did not tell anyone\nabout what Kaufman did during the summer 2002 incidents because KC was scared.\nShortly before the summer 2004 visit, KC told his step-siblings about the abuse. KC\ntestified that Kaufman asked KC during his 2004 visit if he had told anyone about their\nsexual interactions and that Kaufman \"seemed kind of angry.\" KC denied telling\nanyone because he was afraid of what Kaufman would do.\n\f                                                                                   - 20 -\n\n\n      {¶ 62} Based solely on their distant familial relationship, the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to allow the court to use the Eskridge inference of psychological force.\nSee 38 Ohio St.3d at 58. Kaufman was never in charge of caring for KC, nor was he\nacting in loco parentis at any point, and was instead merely one of the adults at the\nhouse during family gatherings. However, Kaufman placed himself in a position of\nauthority over KC when he said that he would punish KC for damaging the car and that\nif KC did not acquiesce to Kaufman's punishment, then Kaufman would get him into\neven more trouble. This is coupled with the fact that KC was of tender years and small\nfor his age during the two offenses charged.\n      {¶ 63} Additionally, Kaufman did in fact physically harm KC by repeatedly\n\nstriking him in the testicles. It appears that striking his testicles was not intended to\nsubdue KC for the purpose of committing other sexual acts, but was one of the sexual\nacts in and of itself. Nonetheless, the physical violence, the age disparity between the\nparties, the threats of worse punishment, and Kaufman's assertion of authority as an\nadult who had the power to discipline KC all indicate that KC's will was overcome by\nfear and duress, and he felt compelled to submit. Given the totality of the evidence\npresented by the state, reasonable minds could conclude that the rape counts against\nKC were committed with force or threat of force.\n      {¶ 64} The force element in each of Kaufman's rape convictions was based on\n\nsufficient evidence; thus, Kaufman's fourth assignment of error is meritless.\n                          Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n      {¶ 65} In his third of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 66} \"The trial court denied Appellant due process under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment in that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence and\nthe jury's verdict was inconsistent with the evidence and testimony presented.\"\n\f                                                                                     - 21 -\n\n\n       {¶ 67} Kaufman argues that the convictions were against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence due to the number of contradictions in testimonial evidence and the lack\nof physical evidence of the crimes.\n       {¶ 68} When a court conducts a manifest-weight analysis, it weighs all of the\n\nevidence and reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of each witness, and\ndetermines whether the fact-finders clearly lost their way in resolving conflicts in the\nevidence to the point that they \"created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the\nconviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\" Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at\n387. The factors that a reviewing court may consider in a manifest-weight analysis\ninclude whether the evidence was incredible; whether the evidence was uncontradicted;\nwhether a witness was impeached; what was not proved; the certainty of the evidence;\nthe reliability of the evidence; whether any witness's testimony was self-serving; and\nwhether the evidence was vague, uncertain, conflicting, fragmentary, or illogical. State\nv. Brown, 7th Dist. No. 03 MA 231, 2005-Ohio-4502, at ¶35-45. See also State v.\nApanovitch (1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 23-24, 514 N.E.2d 394, citing State v. Mattison\n(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 23 OBR 43, 490 N.E.2d 926, syllabus.\n       {¶ 69} The manifest-weight analysis is a broader inquiry into the original trial,\n\nbut allows for a reversal only in exceptional circumstances. Thompkins at 387. This is\nbecause the trier of fact was in the best position to determine the credibility of the\nwitnesses and the weight due to the evidence. State v. DeHass (1967), 10 Ohio St.2d\n230, 231, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212. Thus the reviewing court must determine\nwhether the appellant or the appellee provided the more believable evidence, but must\nnot completely substitute its judgment for that of the original trier of fact \"unless it is\npatently apparent that the factfinder lost its way.\" State v. Woulard, 158 Ohio App.3d\n31, 2004-Ohio-3395, 813 N.E.2d 964, at ¶81.\n\f                                                                                  - 22 -\n\n\n      {¶ 70} Kaufman lists three main factors as going against the weight of the\n\nevidence: the lack of physical evidence to corroborate the claims, contradictions of the\ndetails of KC's testimony, and contradictions of the details of JB's testimony.\n      {¶ 71} As for the physical evidence argument, there is no requirement that\n\ntestimonial evidence of sexual abuse must be corroborated by physical or other\nevidence. See In re Hollobaugh, 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797, at ¶21. The\nlack of physical evidence in this case is understandable, given that this case was\nprosecuted years after the abusive acts were alleged to have occurred.\n      {¶ 72} As for KC's testimony, Kaufman points to conflicting testimony about\n\ncertain details during the first instance of abuse in Wisconsin and whether or not the\nbathroom door at Donna's house could be shut or locked.\n      {¶ 73} KC testified that Kaufman had been driving a red Firebird during a trip to\n\nWisconsin, but defense witnesses testified that Kaufman had been driving a moving\ntruck and a white Buick. There also were conflicts as to which trips to Wisconsin were\nmade, when they were made, and which people stayed in which hotel rooms. These\nconflicts surround events that were not charged against Kaufman and were only\ndescribed as background information. Thus, these conflicts were not material to the\ncase against Kaufman and at most would have spoken to KC's overall credibility.\n      {¶ 74} KC described Kaufman as having abused him during the weeks that he\n\nvisited Donna in Ohio and described the abuse as happening in the attic, the basement,\nand the second-floor bathroom. On cross-examination, KC stated that he did not\nremember Kaufman locking any doors when they were in the basement or the attic, but\nthat he remembered Kaufman locking the second-story bathroom door. Witnesses for\nboth the state and the defense testified that the door to the second-story bathroom did\nnot shut all the way and could not be locked.\n\f                                                                                   - 23 -\n\n\n      {¶ 75} Kaufman has pointed out a few inconsistencies in KC's testimony, but KC\n\notherwise gave detailed testimony about all of the events pertinent to the case and\nprovided consistent testimony as to the facts that satisfied the elements of the offenses\ncharged against Kaufman. Taking into account inconsistencies or conflicting evidence\nwhile weighing the credibility of an individual witness is well within the province of\nthe jury. Kaufman has not demonstrated that the evidence as it pertained to KC was so\ninconsistent that no reasonable jury could have believed him. The convictions\nregarding KC were therefore not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n      {¶ 76} As for JB's testimony, Kaufman points to inconsistencies in his\n\ndescription of events that occurred before, during, and after the time periods of the\ncharges in order to argue that JB's overall credibility was undermined. Kaufman also\nspecifically argues that the conflicting testimony of other witnesses as to when JB first\nmet Kaufman rendered Counts 3 and 9 to be factually impossible and therefore against\nthe manifest weight of the evidence. The three time periods of the convictions are\nOctober 1995 to 1996 (Counts 3 and 9), October 1996 to 1997 (Counts 1 and 4), and\nOctober 1997 to 1998 (Counts 2 and 5).\n      {¶ 77} JB testified that Kaufman began to touch JB inappropriately around the\n\nage of 6 (October 1993 to 1994) and that the first instance occurred at Kaufman's\nmother's (Donna) house. Kaufman and Donna testified that Donna lived in Michigan\nat that time and did not move to Ohio until 1996. JB also testified that Kaufman\ntouched him inappropriately at age 11 (October 1998 to 1999) while washing him after\nJB had broken his arm in a bicycle accident at a location in New Springfield, Ohio.\nTracey and Kaufman testified that JB had fractured his arm in a bicycle accident during\na camping trip in Pennsylvania and that JB had not been to New Springfield.\nAdditionally, Kaufman points out that JB agreed during cross-examination that no anal\n\f                                                                                - 24 -\n\n\npenetration occurred before 1997. However, JB also testified on direct and redirect\nexamination that the first instance of anal penetration occurred when he was eight\nyears old, which would have been between October 1995 and October 1996.\n      {¶ 78} JB testified that his mother Tracey met Kaufman through LBT. JB's ex-\n\nstepfather, Reginald, worked for LBT. No one testified as to when they thought\nReginald started working at LBT, though he started some time before Tracey did, and\npossibly before Kaufman did, though the testimony is unclear. Kaufman started\nworking at LBT in 1991. JB did not testify as to when he thought his mother started\nworking at LBT, though he said that Tracey and Kaufman became friends while\nReginald was \"on the road\" working for LBT.\n      {¶ 79} Tracey testified that she met Kaufman in early 1996, that she began to\n\nwork for LBT in late 1996, and that she became friends with Kaufman at that time.\nTracey and Kaufman testified that Kaufman had met JB in the fall of 1997. However,\nKaufman also testified that he had met JB while Kaufman was living in Austintown,\nbefore he had the house on Berkshire Drive in Youngstown, which occurred in April\n1996. Although the defense testimony severely undermines JB's credibility regarding\nhis descriptions of Kaufman's abuse from 1993 to 1995, Kaufman's own testimony\ncould support the contention that Kaufman knew JB during all of the dates between\n1995 and 1998 in the indictment.\n      {¶ 80} Thus, although Kaufman claims that the defense testimony that JB met\n\nKaufman in 1997 proved that the counts in October 1995 to 1996 were factually\nimpossible, the testimony offered by both sides was incomplete, inconsistent, and\nvague. The matter comes down to a question of overall credibility, which the jury\napparently resolved in favor of JB.\n      {¶ 81} Kaufman further points to inconsistencies in JB's testimony to argue that\n\f                                                                                   - 25 -\n\n\nthe remainder of the convictions against Kaufman involving JB, were against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Kaufman asserts that JB's claims that most of the\nmolestation occurred during or after getting out of the shower at the house on\nBerkshire were impossible because the shower did not work. Kaufman's Exhibit 14, an\ninspection report on the Berkshire house, stated that there was one bathroom in the\nhouse, and that \"Shower head is damaged. Shower head replacement is recommended.\nNo water pressure to shower. (Repairs needed.)\" Tracey and Kaufman both testified\nthat the shower did not work and was never fixed.\n      {¶ 82} However, given that there was only one bathroom in Kaufman's house on\n\nBerkshire, it does not necessarily follow that JB's claims were factually impossible.\nAlthough Kaufman offered testimony that contradicted JB's testimony, the defense did\nnot unequivocally impeach JB's testimony regarding abuse that occurred in 1995 to\n1996 or abuse that occurred in the bathroom of Kaufman's house.\n      {¶ 83} Kaufman was able to strongly call into question the accuracy or\n\nbelievability of JB's testimony as compared to KC's testimony. But JB otherwise gave\ndetailed testimony about all of the events pertinent to the case, and provided consistent\ntestimony as to the facts that satisfied the elements of the offenses charged against\nKaufman. Moreover, a defendant \"is not entitled to reversal on manifest weight\ngrounds merely because inconsistent evidence was offered at trial, 'as \"[t]he trier of\nfact is free to believe or disbelieve any or all of the testimony presented.'\" State v.\nFavor, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-215, 2008-Ohio-5371, at ¶10. The jury was permitted to\nbelieve or disbelieve any of the testimony presented, and we still must give deference\nto the jury's determination of the credibility of the witnesses. Kaufman has not\ndemonstrated that JB's testimony was so inconsistent that no reasonable jury could\nhave believed him. A jury could have found JB to be the more credible witness\n\f                                                                                     - 26 -\n\n\nwithout having lost its way.\n      {¶ 84} Although the issue is close given that the overall credibility of JB was\n\nextremely questionable, this is not one of the exceptional cases in which the evidence\nweighs heavily against the defendant's convictions, warranting reversal. Therefore,\nKaufman's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and his\nthird assignment of error is meritless.\n  Limitation of Cross-Examination in Violation of the Confrontation Clause\n      {¶ 85} In his second of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 86} \"The Trial Court Erred in Limiting the Scope of Cross Examination\n\nThereby Depriving Appellant of His Constitutional Right Of Confrontation and Cross\nExamination in Violation of U.S. Const. Amend V, VI, XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I\n§10 &16.\"\n      {¶ 87} Kaufman asserts that the trial court violated his right to confront witnesses\n\nby not allowing Kaufman to cross-examine JB regarding his juvenile adjudication for\nthe molestation of his step-brother, RT. The state counters that the elicitation of such\ntestimony was barred by Evid.R. 609(D), R.C. 2151.357(H), and R.C. 2907.02(D).\n      {¶ 88} A trial court enjoys broad discretion regarding the admissibility of\n\nevidence. Thus, an appellate court should not disturb the trial court's decision absent\nan abuse of discretion. State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900\nN.E.2d 565, at ¶66; State v. Shoop (1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 462, 469, 622 N.E.2d 665.\nBecause JB's adjudication involved matters of a sexual nature, the limitations of the\nrape-shield statute applied. Pursuant to the rape-shield statute, evidence of specific\ninstances of a victim's sexual activity is inadmissible \"unless it involves evidence of the\norigin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or the victim's past sexual activity with the\noffender, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a\n\f                                                                                   - 27 -\n\n\nfact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not\noutweigh its probative value.\" R.C. 2907.02(D).\n      {¶ 89} The rape-shield statutes were designed to prohibit evidence that is\n\nextremely inflammatory and prejudicial and only marginally probative. State v.\nGardner (1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 14, 17, 13 O.O.3d 8, 391 N.E.2d 337. \"The court, in\ndetermining whether prior acts should be admitted, must balance the interests of the\nvictim, which the statute is designed to protect, and the defendant's right to confront\nand cross-examine the state's witnesses. State v. Williams (1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 33, 21\nOBR 320, 487 N.E.2d 560. If the evidence in question is merely being used to impeach\nthe victim's credibility, it is not of probative value as to the alleged rape itself and\nshould not be admitted. Id. However, if the evidence has probative value to the\ndeterminative issue of fact -- i.e., whether the victim was raped by the defendant on the\ndate alleged -- then the probative value of the testimony outweighs any interest the\nstate has in exclusion. Id. at 36.\" State v. Yenser, 176 Ohio App.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-\n1145, 889 N.E.2d 581, at ¶4. See also State v. Gardner (1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 14, 18,\n13 O.O.3d 8, 391 N.E.2d 337; State v. Ferguson (1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 5 OBR 380,\n450 N.E.2d 265; State v. Guthrie (1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 465, 621 N.E.2d 551.\n      {¶ 90} On cross-examination, JB stated that he hated Kaufman starting from the\n\ntime he, JB, was no longer allowed to see his family. Counsel asked JB to specify, to\nwhich JB responded, \"Soon after I had moved in with my father, I was no longer\nallowed to come over, nor was I permitted to call my mother.\" Counsel continued:\n      {¶ 91} \"Q: What you were complaining about is that you were not able to see\n\nyour stepbrother [RT]; is that right?\n      {¶ 92} \"A: And my mother.\n\n      {¶ 93} \"Q: And you're attributing that to Michael Kaufman; is that right?\n\f                                                                                  - 28 -\n\n\n      {¶ 94} \"A: Yes.\"\n\n      {¶ 95} Counsel then had a side bar and asked to bring in extrinsic evidence of\n\nJB's juvenile adjudication for the molestation of RT, in order to impeach his testimony.\nCounsel intended to show that JB was removed from his mother and Kaufman's house\ndue to the adjudication. The state asserted that JB did not make claims as to why he\nhad to move out of the home, and moreover, it was Tracey's decision to kick JB out of\nthe house, not any order from the juvenile court. Additionally, the state noted that\nallowing the evidence would open the door for the state to introduce testimony\nregarding Kaufman's alleged sexual abuse of RT, whose testimony had previously been\nbarred as \"other acts\" evidence. The trial court decided that the matter was collateral\nand did not allow Kaufman to bring in extrinsic evidence of the adjudication. Upon\nfurther questioning, counsel asked JB why his mother and Kaufman wanted him out of\nthe house, and JB responded that he did not know why. Counsel renewed his motion,\nand the trial court stated that Kaufman was stuck with the answer he received.\n      {¶ 96} The question of exactly why JB hated Kaufman or what events led to JB\n\nbeing kicked out of his mother’s and Kaufman's home are issues collateral to the case.\nThe admission of evidence that JB had been adjudicated for the molestation of his\nyounger brother would not help to prove or disprove any of the elements of any\ncharges against Kaufman. It would have served only to impeach JB's credibility.\nBecause the evidence served only to impeach JB and did not have any probative value\nregarding a material issue in the case, the evidence was inadmissible. The trial court's\ndecision to bar such cross-examination was therefore not in error, let alone an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n      {¶ 97} Additionally, although the topic of JB's adjudication was raised during\n\npretrial discussions, Kaufman did not request a hearing or otherwise move the court to\n\f                                                                                   - 29 -\n\n\nconsider the admissibility of such evidence three or more days before trial as dictated\nby the rape-shield statute. R.C. 2907.02(E). Because Kaufman failed to give the\nstatutorily required notice and request for hearing, he has waived the issue.\n      {¶ 98} Finally, even if JB's adjudication had not involved evidence of JB's prior\n\nsexual activity, the evidence nonetheless would have been barred by Evid.R. 609(D),\nwhich provides that evidence of a juvenile adjudication is not admissible for\nimpeachment except as provided by statute. In his argument on appeal, Kaufman has\nnot provided any statutory justification for the introduction of JB's adjudication, aside\nfrom R.C. 2151.357(H), which explicitly states that adjudication cannot be used for the\npurpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness. As discussed above, proof that JB\nhad been adjudicated at age 13 for molesting RT did not go to a material issue to\nKaufman's case, and thus the attempted use was only for the purpose of impeaching\nJB's credibility. Again, the decision to prohibit the introduction of JB's juvenile\nadjudication was not error. Accordingly, Kaufman's second assignment of error is\nmeritless.\n                            Improper Jury Instructions\n      {¶ 99} In his fifth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 100} \"Appellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties\n\nSecured by the United States Constitution Amend. V & XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I, §§\n10 and 16 When the Trial Court Gave a Jury Instruction Which Eliminated the States\nObligation to Prove Each Element of the Offense of Rape.\"\n      {¶ 101} Kaufman argues that the trial court improperly provided the jury with\n\nthe Eskridge definition of psychological force, given that the state did not provide\nsufficient evidence that Kaufman was in a position of trust or authority over the\nvictims. See 38 Ohio St.3d at 58.\n\f                                                                                   - 30 -\n\n\n      {¶ 102} A trial court is obligated pursuant to Crim.R. 30(A) to provide all jury\n\ninstructions that are relevant and necessary for the jury to weigh the evidence and\ndischarge its duty as a fact-finder.

An abuse of discretion\nconnotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies an attitude on the part of the\ncourt that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams (1980), 62\nOhio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.\n      {¶ 104} The state moved the trial court to include the Eskridge definition of\n\nforce during jury instructions. See 38 Ohio St.3d at 58. The trial court provided the\nfollowing information on the force specifications:\n      {¶ 105} \"The purpose to compel someone to submit must be by force or threat of\n\nforce. Force means any violence, compulsion or constraint, physically exerted by any\nmeans upon or against any person or thing.\n      {¶ 106} \"Threat includes any direct threat or any indirect threat.\n\n      {¶ 107} \"Resistance, the prosecutor need not prove that the victim physically\n\nresisted the defendant.\n      {¶ 108} \"The court instructs you that when the relationship between the victim\n\f                                                                                     - 31 -\n\n\nand the defendant is one of child and parent or stepparent or steprelative or other\nsimilar authority figure, the element of force need not be openly displayed or\nphysically brutal. It can be subtle or slight or psychological or emotionally powerful.\nEvidence of an expressed threat of harm, or evidence of significant physical restraint is\nnot required.\n      {¶ 109} \"If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that under the circumstances in\n\nthe evidence, the victim's will was overcome by fear or duress or intimidation, then the\nelement of force has been proved.\"\n      {¶ 110} Kaufman does not take issue with any of the wording of the trial court's\n\ninstructions. Kaufman simply contends that the Eskridge portion of the instruction as a\nwhole should not have been included because of his insufficient-evidence claim.\nPursuant to our analysis in Kaufman's fourth assignment of error, the state presented\nsufficient evidence that Kaufman was in a position of authority over the victims.\nMoreover, the language of the instructions indicates that the trial court did not tell the\njury that they must find Kaufman to have been in a position of authority over the\nvictims. Instead, the trial court explained that a finding of an authoritative relationship\nwas a condition precedent for the use of the relaxed \"psychological force\" standard.\nThe jury was free to use either force definition provided, depending on their findings\nregarding the relationship between Kaufman and the victims.\n      {¶ 111} There was sufficient evidence for the trial court to present the question\n\nof Kaufman's position of authority over the victims and thus the Eskridge definition of\nforce. The trial court properly instructed the jury, and Kaufman's fifth assignment is\nmeritless.\n                  Abuse of Discretion to Allow Expert Testimony\n      {¶ 112} In his sixth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\f                                                                                    - 32 -\n\n\n      {¶ 113} \"It was An Abuse of Discretion for The Trial Court to Permit ‘Expert’\n\nTestimony Without the Expert having Any Factual Basis for the Testimony Offered.\nThereby denying Appellant's Right to Due Process Guaranteed by the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, 16 of the Ohio\nConstitution.\"\n      {¶ 114} Kaufman argues that the expert testimony of Dr. Paul McPherson should\n\nnot have been admitted because it merely bolstered the credibility of the victims, the\ngeneral nature of the testimony rendered it irrelevant to the case, it involved\ninformation within the general knowledge of the jury, and it was not based on\nMcPherson's first-hand knowledge about the victims.\n      {¶ 115} A trial court's determination of the admissibility of expert testimony is\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. Valentine v. Conrad, 110 Ohio St.3d 42, 2006-Ohio-\n3561, 850 N.E.2d 683, at ¶9. An abuse of discretion \"suggests unreasonableness,\narbitrariness, or unconscionability. Without those elements, it is not the role of this\ncourt to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\" Id. See also State v. Adams\n(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.\n      {¶ 116} Courts should favor the admissibility of expert testimony whenever it is\n\nrelevant and the criteria of Evid.R. 702 are met. State v. Nemeth (1998), 82 Ohio St.3d\n202, 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332, citing State v. Williams (1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 4 OBR\n144, 446 N.E.2d 444, syllabus. Evid.R. 702 provides that a witness may testify as an\nexpert if all of the following apply:\n      {¶ 117} \"(A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the\n\nknowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common\namong lay persons;\n      {¶ 118} \"(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge,\n\f                                                                                    - 33 -\n\n\nskill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;\n      {¶ 119} \"(C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or\n\nother specialized information.\"\n      {¶ 120} Additionally, Evid. R.703 provides as follows:\n\n      {¶ 121} \"The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an\n\nopinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the\nhearing.\"\n      {¶ 122} Thus, according to Evid.R. 702 and 703, McPherson's testimony must be\n\nneeded to assist the jury, he must be adequately qualified as an expert on the specific\nsubject matter, his testimony must be based on reliable information, and the\ninformation or opinion that he shares must be based on admitted evidence or on facts\nthat McPherson has perceived.\n      {¶ 123} Kaufman does not raise issue with McPherson's general qualifications\n\nand seems to concede that it was not error to qualify McPherson as an expert in his\nfield. McPherson was allowed to testify regarding his academic knowledge and\nprofessional experience with child sexual-abuse victims. McPherson testified that it is\ncommon for child victims to delay disclosure of the abuse or to partially disclose the\nabuse and that it is not common for anal penetration to result in permanent scars. The\nparties do not dispute that McPherson did not interview either victim or testify as to the\nspecific facts regarding either victim. Further, the parties do not dispute the fact that\nMcPherson did not give any opinion regarding JB's or KC's credibility or the veracity\nof their testimony. The court limited McPherson's testimony to general information\nand refused to allow specific hypothetical examples. Kaufman extensively cross-\nexamined McPherson on statistics of false allegations and hypothetical questions about\nanal trauma.\n\f                                                                                     - 34 -\n\n\n      {¶ 124} As his first argument, Kaufman contends that McPherson's testimony\n\nwas inadmissible because he merely functioned as an advocate and bolstered the\ncredibility of the victims. Kaufman cites State v. Butcher, 170 Ohio App.3d 52, 2007-\nOhio-118, 866 N.E.2d 13, in support of his argument. However, in Butcher, the\nwitness’s testimony was inadmissible because it was a violation of the rules against\nhearsay. Id. at ¶66. The trial court in Butcher permitted the witness's testimony of the\nvictim's statements through the medical hearsay exception. Id. at ¶52. The appellate\ncourt found that the context of the medical interview was to collect evidence, not to\ndiagnose, and there had been no voir dire of the victims. Id. at ¶66-71. Because that\nwitness was a manufactured witness for the state, the hearsay testimony was not\ninherently reliable under the medical hearsay exception. In the case at hand, the trial\ncourt was not concerned with the inherent reliability of McPherson's hearsay\nstatements because McPherson offered no hearsay testimony. As for Kaufman's\ncontention that McPherson merely acted to bolster the credibility of the victims, it is\nwell established that expert testimony that bolsters a victim's credibility is permissible.\nState v. Jordan, 7th Dist. No. 06 HA 586, 2007-Ohio-3333, at ¶24, citing State v.\nStowers (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 262, 690 N.E.2d. 881.\n      {¶ 125} Kaufman's argument attempts to create an expert-advocate dichotomy\n\nout of the medical professional-advocate dichotomy under Evid.R. 803(4). Such a\ndichotomy does not exist under the rules of evidence applicable to this case,\nEvid.R.702 and 703. An expert witness's first-hand testimony, like any other witness's\nfirst-hand testimony, can be believed or disbelieved by the finder of fact and there is no\nrequirement that all experts only provide \"inherently reliable\" testimony. Kaufman's\nfirst argument is therefore not well taken.\n      {¶ 126} As his second argument, Kaufman contends that McPherson's testimony\n\f                                                                                  - 35 -\n\n\nwas so general that it did not make the existence of any material fact in the case more\nor less probable and was thus inadmissible pursuant to Evid.R. 401 and 402. However,\nevidence that impeaches or bolsters witness credibility \"is of consequence to the action\nbecause it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.\" State v.\nMoore (1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65, 531 N.E.2d 691. Moreover, an expert witness is\npermitted to testify about general information which allows the finder of fact to draw\nits own conclusion. See, e.g., State v. Buell (1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 131, 22 OBR\n203, 489 N.E.2d 795 (allowing expert testimony concerning factors that might impair\nthe accuracy of a typical eyewitness identification). The Ohio Supreme Court has\nspecifically stated that testimony from a qualified expert on the general behavioral\ncharacteristics of sexually abused children is admissible. State v. Stowers (1998), 81\nOhio St.3d 260, 262, 690 N.E.2d. 881. As Kaufman himself argued, McPherson's\ntestimony functioned to bolster the credibility of the victims, specifically the common\npatterns of disclosure of child sex-abuse victims. McPherson's testimony was therefore\nnot inadmissible due to relevancy issues. Kaufman's second argument is therefore not\nwell taken.\n      {¶ 127} As his third argument, Kaufman argues that McPherson's testimony was\n\ninadmissible under Evid.R. 702(A) because he offered no specialized knowledge\noutside the realm of the common knowledge of the jury. Kaufman primarily relies on\nState v. Roquemore (1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 448, 620 N.E.2d 110, in support of his\nargument. The expert testimony in Roquemore was an opinion on whether a violent\n\"type\" of person would have committed the crime in question based on a crime-scene\nphotograph assessment and comparison with statistics on other violent crimes. Id. at\n453-454. In essence, the expert witness testified that because the crime scene was\ndisorganized, the crime was committed in a violent rage. Id. at 454. Such testimony\n\f                                                                                    - 36 -\n\n\nnot only contravened Evid.R. 702(A) because the jury was able to determine whether\nsomething violent had happened at the scene, but the testimony was also questionable\nunder Evid.R. 705 for a lack of statistical reliability, under Evid.R. 403(A) for the\nprejudicial way in which the defendant was profiled or stereotyped, and under Evid.R.\n404(A) for imputing a violent character to the defendant without the issue of the\ndefendant's character having been raised. Id. at 454-456. Such issues are not\napplicable in this case.\n         {¶ 128} Instead, it is established in Ohio law that the average fact-finder may\n\nrequire assistance in understanding the \"behavioral characteristics of minor victims of\nsexual abuse.\" State v. Bell, 176 Ohio App.3d 378, 2008-Ohio-2578, 891 N.E.2d\n1280, at ¶56, discussing Stowers, supra. This includes the characteristics of typical\nchild victims in regard to their disclosure of the abuse. See State v. McGlown, 6th\nDist. No. L-07-1163, 2009-Ohio-2160, at ¶41; State v. Bortner, 9th Dist. No.\n02CA008189, 2003-Ohio-3508, at ¶46. The trial court in this case allowed McPherson\nto testify to help the jury better understand the behavioral characteristics of child sex-\nabuse victims that a layperson might not normally take into account, provided that\nMcPherson did not testify as to the veracity of the victims' statements. The trial court\nallowed the testimony in accordance with current Ohio case law and with Evid.R.\n702(A) and was thus not an abuse of discretion. Kaufman's third argument is not well\ntaken.\n         {¶ 129} As a fourth argument, Kaufman argues that McPherson's testimony was\n\ninadmissible pursuant to Evid.R. 703 because he had no first-hand knowledge about\nthe victims. Kaufman relies on cases in which experts testified regarding the\nconsistency of the particular victim's behavior with that generally observed in other\nvictims. Kaufman argues that those cases should not apply here, because McPherson\n\f                                                                                - 37 -\n\n\nhad no information about JB and KC. It is true that McPherson's testimony would\nhave been inadmissible had he offered specific conclusions about JB and KC without\nbeing given any information about them. However, McPherson did not provide any\nspecific conclusions about JB and KC.\n      {¶ 130} Evid.R. 703, as it applies to this case, does require that McPherson\n\ntestify only about facts that he has perceived. However, it does not require that he\ntestify on facts specific to the case. As noted above, an expert witness is allowed to\ntestify about general background information that might assist the fact-finder. Buell,\nsupra. See also, e.g., Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp. (1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 431, 437-\n438, 715 N.E.2d 546 (providing general statistics on railroad crossings); State v.\nDrummond, 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038 (providing general\nexpert testimony regarding gang culture). The Rules of Evidence do not require that an\nexpert witness provide a factual link between his general testimony and the specific\nfacts of a case. As to the information imparted by McPherson, Kaufman does not\nargue that his statistics were unfounded or that he gave inaccurate information\nregarding his personal professional experience with children making allegations of\nsexual abuse. Thus, McPherson's testimony was admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 703,\nand Kaufman's fourth argument is not well taken.\n      {¶ 131} In summary, McPherson's testimony was within the permissible bounds\n\nof the Rules of Evidence. McPherson testified about characteristics of sexually abused\nchildren. He made no comparison between those generalities within his expertise and\nthe victims in question. He offered no opinion as to whether JB and KC had in fact\nbeen sexually abused, whether he believed the testimony of JB and KC, or whether JB\nand KC were credible witnesses. McPherson only provided information regarding\ncommon patterns of child-abuse victims in order to assist the jury in their assessment\n\f                                                                                     - 38 -\n\n\nof JB and KC's credibility. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\nallowing McPherson to testify, Kaufman's sixth assignment of error is meritless.\n                              Prosecutorial Misconduct\n      {¶ 132} In his tenth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 133} \"Appellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties\n\nSecured by the United States Constitution Amend. XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I, §§ 10\nand 16 As a Result of the Improper Questions and Arguments of the Prosecutor.\"\n      {¶ 134} Kaufman contends that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by\n\nasking inflammatory questions during cross-examination, making unsupported attacks\non Kaufman's character during closing statements, and imputing a lack of credibility to\nKaufman by inappropriately inserting into evidence that the state's witnesses had left\nOhio prior to the commencement of Kaufman's case in chief.\n      {¶ 135} In reviewing the state's alleged misconduct, a court should look at\n\nwhether the state's remarks were improper and whether the prosecutor's remarks\naffected substantial rights of the appellant. State v. Smith (1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14,\n14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. An appellate court should not find reversible error\nunless, in the context of the entire proceedings, it appears that the misconduct deprived\nthe appellant of a fair trial. State v. Fears (1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 332, 715 N.E.2d\n136; State v. Schwab, 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 78, 2009-Ohio-1312, at ¶25, citing State v.\nLott (1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166, 555 N.E.2d 293. \"The touchstone of analysis 'is\nthe fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.'\" State v. Diar, 120 Ohio\nSt.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, at ¶140, quoting Smith v. Phillips (1982),\n455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.\n      {¶ 136} As his first argument, Kaufman contends that the state asked improper\n\nquestions during the cross-examination of Tracey and Kaufman in order to imply that\n\f                                                                                - 39 -\n\n\nthey were bad people. During Tracey's cross-examination, the state asked the\nfollowing:\n      {¶ 137} \"Q: You understand that [JB] loves you; right?\n\n      {¶ 138} \"A: Yes.\n\n      {¶ 139} \"Q: And if he had complained to you about sexual abuse, and you didn't\n\ndo anything about it, that would make you a pretty bad mother, wouldn't it?\n      {¶ 140} \"A: Yes it would.\"\n\n      {¶ 141} During Kaufman's cross examination, the state asked the following:\n\n      {¶ 142} \"Q: And if you [committed the offenses charged], that would make you\n\na bad person, wouldn't it?\n      {¶ 143} * * *\n\n      {¶ 144} \"A: I would think so.\n\n      {¶ 145} * * *\n\n      {¶ 146} \"Q: A really sick person; right?\n\n      {¶ 147} * * *\n\n      {¶ 148} \"A: Yes.\"\n\n      {¶ 149} Kaufman contends that these two exchanges were only for the purpose\n\nof attacking the witness's character. The general scope of the questioning of Tracey\nwas appropriate, given that her direct examination included repeated testimony that JB\nhad not disclosed the abuse to her at any point. However, the form of the questions\nposed to Tracey and to Kaufman was inappropriate. The state seems to have worded\nthe questions merely to have the witnesses assent to questions with the words \"bad\nmother\" and \"sick person\" in them, even though the hypothetical nature of the\nquestions added nothing to the evidence.\n      {¶ 150} Kaufman's argument indicates that he is taking issue with these two\n\f                                                                                    - 40 -\n\n\nquestions because of the general impression that the mere utterance of the questions\nwould leave in the jury's mind. However, we cannot conclude that the jury decided\nthat Tracey was a bad mother and that Kaufman was a sick person due to the state's\nhypothetical questions which elicited obvious answers. While it would have been\npreferable for the state to have refrained from adding such superfluous questions, the\nquestions did not rise to the level of prejudicial error in the context of the entirety of\ntestimony presented at trial. See, e.g., State v. Gillard (1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 230,\n533 N.E.2d 272 (noting that the reference to the defendant's nickname as originating\nfrom shooting a sleeping woman in the head, while improper, was insignificant\ncompared to the weight of the evidence presented). Within the larger scope of the\ncross-examinations, the witnesses answered the questions in a way that indicated that\nthey did not share the qualities of the sick or bad people described. Kaufman was not\ndenied a fair trial merely because the state asked the foregoing questions.\n      {¶ 151} As his second argument, Kaufman contends that the state committed\n\nprosecutorial misconduct by stating during closing argument that Kaufman was \"a liar,\na con artist, and a child molester.\" Again, Kaufman asserts that the state improperly\nimpugned his character.\n      {¶ 152} Because the statements were made during the state's closing arguments,\n\n\"we must keep in mind the latitude counsel is given during closing arguments and that\nthe closing must be viewed in its entirety in determining whether the complained of\nremarks were prejudicial.\" State v. Morris, 7th Dist. No. 08 CO 7, 2009-Ohio-3326, at\n¶133, citing State v. Byrd (1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 79, 82, 512 N.E.2d 611; State v. Smith\n(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. An appellate court must\n\"view the state's closing argument in its entirety to determine whether the allegedly\nimproper remarks were prejudicial.\" State v. Treesh (2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 466,\n\f                                                                                     - 41 -\n\n\n739 N.E.2d 749. A conviction should be reversed due to improper statements in\nclosing only if the jury would have found the defendant not guilty but for the improper\nstatements. State v. Benge (1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 136, 141, 661 N.E.2d 1019.\n      {¶ 153} The state has the duty to pursue the convictions of guilty defendants\n\nwith all appropriate zeal. However, the state's arguments to the jury cannot extend\nbeyond reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence presented. A\nprosecutor may state his opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial. Diar,\n120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, at ¶213. For example, in State v. Carter, 7th\nDist. No. 05 JE 7, 2007-Ohio-3502, this court noted that a prosecutor may state in\nclosing arguments that the defendant is \"someone who kills people,\" as a conclusion\nbased on the evidence presented during trial that the defendant had killed someone. Id.\nat ¶47.\n      {¶ 154} The state presented evidence during trial that Kaufman had manipulated\n\nthe victims into submitting to his sexual abuse, violating their trust and the trust of the\nother family members involved in the victims' lives at the time. Although \"'a\nconviction based solely on the inflammation of fears and passions, rather than proof of\nguilt, requires reversal' * * *, '[r]ealism compels us to recognize that criminal trials\ncannot be squeezed dry of all feeling.'\" Carter, at ¶45, quoting State v. Williams\n(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 23 OBR 13, 490 N.E.2d 906, and State v. Keenan\n(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 409, 613 N.E.2d 203. Although the state's choice of words\ncould be seen as hyperbolic, the depiction of Kaufman was based on evidence\npresented at trial and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. Moreover, any potential\nerror from the statement would have been corrected by the trial court's instructions that\nthe arguments of counsel were not evidence. Diar at ¶211, citing State v. Waddy\n(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 436, 588 N.E.2d 819. Thus the state's single description of\n\f                                                                                   - 42 -\n\n\nKaufman as \"a liar, a con artist, and a child molester\" in its closing argument was\npermissible.\n      {¶ 155} Finally, Kaufman argues that the state committed prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct by inserting into evidence the fact that all witnesses for the state were gone\nand could not be called back to provide rebuttal testimony. Kaufman points out that\nthe state further exploited this evidence during closing arguments by implying that\nKaufman waited for the witnesses to leave as part of his trial strategy.\n      {¶ 156} As noted above, the state had some latitude to make broad statements or\n\ninferences during its closing argument. However, a prosecutor is not permitted to go\nbeyond the admissible evidence in a trial. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 OBR 317, 470\nN.E.2d 883. The state should avoid insinuations, which are not supported by\nadmissible evidence, which are used to mislead a jury. Id. at 14. In Smith, the\nprosecution stated during closing arguments that the entirety of the defense's evidence\nwas fabricated, and implied that defense counsel had committed perjury by\nintentionally manufacturing the allegedly false evidence presented. Id. The Ohio\nSupreme Court found that the prosecutor's misconduct was flagrant and overarching to\nthe point of depriving the defendant of a fair trial. Id.\n      {¶ 157} Some parallel could be drawn between Smith and this case in that the\n\nstate in this case made an unsupported inference regarding Kaufman's trial strategy in\norder to undermine his credibility. However, during the state's closing statements, the\nstate appears to be undermining Kaufman's credibility specifically regarding\nconflicting testimony regarding whether or not Donna's bathroom door could be\nlocked. The state did not make the kind of flagrant overarching comments that were at\nissue in Smith. The testimony regarding the bathroom door was pertinent to whether or\nnot KC was a credible witness, or specifically whether KC's testimony regarding one\n\f                                                                                   - 43 -\n\n\nparticular instance of abuse was credible.\n      {¶ 158} The state's insinuation was not terribly strong: Kaufman testified that he\n\nthought the state's witnesses would still be available at the time of his testimony.\nKaufman specifically argued against the state's claim that he \"conveniently\" waited\nuntil the state rested to introduce the fact that the bathroom door did not lock and\npointed out that the evidence was in fact discussed before the state rested. The jury\nfound that KC was, overall, credible despite the strong evidence that he was mistaken\nas to whether Donna's second floor bathroom could be locked. The jury's finding of\ncredibility could have been based on the other consistent and credible testimony\noffered by KC or perhaps based on the fact that the bathroom door was a relatively\nsmall and collateral piece of evidence. It is less likely that the jury would have\nacquitted Kaufman but for the state's improper but relatively weak statements. Given\nthe entirety of the evidence presented and the context of the state's statements, the\nstate's misconduct did not prejudice Kaufman so as to deprive him of a fair trial.\n      {¶ 159} In conclusion, counsel for the state did exceed the boundaries of\n\npropriety a few times during cross-examination and closing statements. However \"[i]f\nevery remark made by counsel outside of the testimony were ground for a reversal,\ncomparatively few verdicts would stand, since in the ardor of advocacy, and in the\nexcitement of trial, even the most experienced of counsel are occasionally carried away\nby this temptation.\" State v. Maurer (1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267, 15 OBR 379, 473\nN.E.2d 768, quoting Dunlop v. United States (1897), 165 U.S. 487, 498, 17 S.Ct. 375,\n41 L.Ed. 799. The few instances of misconduct by the state did not pervade Kaufman's\ntrial to the point that he was denied his due process right to a fair trial. Accordingly,\nKaufman's tenth assignment of error is meritless.\n                          Improper Joinder in Indictment\n\f                                                                                     - 44 -\n\n\n       {¶ 160} In his first of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n       {¶ 161} \"The Trial Court Erred by Denying relief from Improper Joinder of the\n\nIndictment Thereby Depriving Appellant a Fair Trial in Violation of U.S. CONST.\nAmend. VI, and XIV; and OHIO CONST. Art. §§1, 9, 10, and 16.\"\n       {¶ 162} Kaufman contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\n\nhis motion for relief from prejudicial joinder. Kaufman asserts that the trial court\nshould have granted separate trials for each of the two victims in the complaints against\nhim.\n       {¶ 163} Crim.R. 8(A) provides that \"[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in\n\nthe same indictment, information or complaint in a separate count for each offense if\nthe offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character, or are based on the\nsame act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected\ntogether or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of\ncriminal conduct.\" The law favors joinder because a single trial will conserve time and\nexpense and may minimize the potentially disparate outcomes that can result from\nsuccessive trials before different juries. State v. Schiebel (1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 86-\n87, 564 N.E.2d 54; State v. Torres (1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421\nN.E.2d 1288; State v. Thomas (1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 225, 15 O.O.3d 234, 400\nN.E.2d 401.\n       {¶ 164} However, the interest in joint trials is not unrestricted. Crim.R. 14\n\nprotects parties from prejudicial joinder and states, \"If it appears that a defendant * * *\nis prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * the court shall order an election or separate\ntrial of counts * * *, or provide such other relief as justice requires.\" Severance may\nbe warranted if the trial court finds a serious risk that a joint trial would prevent the\njury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence. United States v. Zafiro\n\f                                                                                 - 45 -\n\n\n(1993), 506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317.\n      {¶ 165} \"When a defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the joinder of\n\nmultiple offenses, a court must determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes\nwould be admissible even if the counts were severed, and (2) if not, whether the\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct.\" State v. Schaim (1992), 65 Ohio St.3d\n51, 59, 600 N.E.2d 661. The first determination, known as the \"other acts test,\" may\nnegate prejudice from joinder if the state could have introduced evidence of one\noffense in a separate trial of another offense under the other- acts portion of Evid.R.\n404(B). State v. Franklin (1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1. The second\ndetermination, known as the \"joinder test,\" only requires a showing that the evidence\nof each of the joined offenses is simple and direct. Id.\n      {¶ 166} It is the defendant who bears the burden of affirmatively showing that\n\nhis rights were prejudiced by joinder. State v. Clifford (1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 207,\n211, 733 N.E.2d 621, citing Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340. Absent a clear showing of\nabuse of discretion, a trial court's decision regarding joinder will not be disturbed.\nTorres; Clifford. The term \"abuse of discretion\" connotes more than an error of law or\nof judgment; it implies that the trial court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or\nunconscionable. State v. Adams (1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 158, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404\nN.E.2d 144.\n      {¶ 167} Kaufman argues that neither the other-acts test nor the joinder test was\n\nsatisfied in this case. Kaufman first argues that the evidence from each victim would\nbe inadmissible as other-acts evidence in separate trials under Evid.R. 404(B) and the\nrape-shield statute. Kaufman states that the alleged pattern of committing sex offenses\nagainst children in a secretive manner is not evidence of a unique modus operandi, but\ninstead simply multiple offenses. The state argues that the evidence would have been\n\f                                                                                   - 46 -\n\n\nadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) because the offenses were committed with the same\nmodus operandi and showed motive, opportunity, intent, plan, knowledge, and/or\nabsence of mistake or accident.\n      {¶ 168} During the March 11, 2008 hearing on Kaufman's motion to sever and\n\nthe state's motion to admit other-acts testimony for unindicted offenses against RT,\nwhich the trial court denied, the state's position on both motions was that Kaufman's\nsimilar modus operandi with each victim justified the admission of other victims'\nevidence in all of the charged offenses. Although there was much discussion by\ncounsel regarding the motions, the trial court did not provide reasoning on the record\nas to why it specifically overruled Kaufman's motion to sever. In the written judgment\nentry, the trial court stated only that Kaufman failed to demonstrate that he would be\nprejudiced by the joinder of the offenses and quoted the language of Crim.R. 8(A) that\nthe offenses \"are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or\ntransaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or\nconstituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal\nconduct.\" Thus, although the state argued in favor of joinder only under the other-acts\ntest, the trial court did not indicate whether it had overruled Kaufman's motion for the\nsame reason.\n      {¶ 169} Looking first at the \"other acts test,\" we analyze whether evidence from\n\neach victim would have been admissible in other trials if they had been severed as\nrequested. We note that \"[t]he admissibility of other acts evidence is carefully limited\nbecause of the substantial danger that the jury will convict the defendant solely because\nit assumes that the defendant has a propensity to commit criminal acts, or deserves\npunishment regardless of whether he or she committed the crime charged in the\nindictment.\" Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 59, citing State v. Curry (1975), 43 Ohio St.2d\n\f                                                                                   - 47 -\n\n\n66, 68, 72 O.O.2d 37, 330 N.E.2d 720.\n          {¶ 170} Had there been separate trials for the offenses against the different\n\nvictims, a request to admit testimony from other victims would need to have survived\nboth Evid.R. 404 and the rape-shield statutes. Evid.R. 404 states that \"[e]vidence of a\nperson's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving\naction in conformity therewith on a particular occasion\" and that \"[e]vidence of other\ncrimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to\nshow action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other\npurposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\nidentity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" Evid.R. 404 notes that exceptions apply\npursuant to rape and gross sexual imposition statutes. The exception language in both\nthe rape and gross-sexual-imposition statutes, R.C. 2907.02(D) and 2907.05(E) is\nidentical and states:\n          {¶ 171} \"Evidence of specific instances of the defendant's sexual activity,\n\nopinion evidence of the defendant's sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the\ndefendant's sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves\nevidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, the defendant's past sexual\nactivity with the victim, or is admissible against the defendant under section 2945.59 of\nthe Revised Code, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is\nmaterial to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature\ndoes not outweigh its probative value.\"\n          {¶ 172} Because we are looking at the admission of sexual-activity evidence\n\nfrom two different victims that do not involve the origin of semen, pregnancy, or\ndisease, the other-acts evidence must be admissible pursuant to R.C. 2945.59, which\nstates:\n\f                                                                                   - 48 -\n\n\n      {¶ 173} \"In any criminal case in which the defendant's motive or intent, the\n\nabsence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan, or system\nin doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or\nintent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan,\nor system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are\ncontemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof\nmay show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\"\n      {¶ 174} Thus there are only a few limited circumstances under which other-acts\n\ninvolving sexual activity would be admissible in a separate case. The state's objective\nof showing that Kaufman had committed the offenses with the same pattern would\nonly fall under the \"scheme, plan, or system\" category of R.C. 2945.59. However,\nsuch \"pattern\" evidence is only relevant in a case under two scenarios:\n      {¶ 175} The first scenario exists in a case when \"the 'other acts' form part of the\n\nimmediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime\ncharged in the indictment. In such cases, it would be virtually impossible to prove that\nthe accused committed the crime charged without also introducing evidence of the\nother acts. To be admissible pursuant to this sub-category of 'scheme, plan or system'\nevidence, the 'other acts' testimony must concern events which are inextricably related\nto the alleged criminal act.\" Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d at 73.\n      {¶ 176} An example of inextricably related acts might involve overlapping time\n\nand place of the offenses against different victims, such as occurred in In re\nHollobaugh, 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797, at ¶35: \"For instance, victim B\nrelated that he stood look out for appellant during an assault on victim A, which assault\nwas previously described by victim A. * * * Victim B also disclosed that he and his\nbrother once gave appellant oral sex at the same time.\" However, when the acts\n\f                                                                                     - 49 -\n\n\nagainst separate victims are \"chronologically and factually separate occurrences, they\nare generally not inextricably related.\" State v. Smith (1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 647,\n667, 617 N.E.2d 1160, citing State v. Eubank (1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 183, 14 O.O.3d\n416, 398 N.E.2d 567. In the case at hand, the offenses alleged occurred at temporally\ndistinct times against victims who did not know one another. Neither victim's evidence\nwas necessary for the background or explanation of the other victim's allegations.\nThus, the evidence from other victims could not be admitted as other-acts evidence\nunder this first scenario.\n      {¶ 177} The second scenario exists in a case when the identity of the perpetrator\n\nof a crime is at issue. See, e.g., State v. Coley (2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 259-260, 754\nN.E.2d 1129; State v. Williams (1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 157-159, 652 N.E.2d 721.\n\"Identity is in issue when the fact of the crime is open and evident but the perpetrator is\nunknown and the accused denies that he committed the crime.\" Smith, at 666. See also\nSchaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at fn. 11. As is often the case in offenses of a sexual nature,\nwhether or not the crime actually occurred is in issue and is thus not open and evident.\nHere, the identity of the offender is not disputed. Like the facts in Schaim, there is no\ndispute that if the victims were telling the truth, Kaufman was the perpetrator. See\nSchaim at 61. This indicates that witness credibility rather than identity is the material\nissue in the case. Thus the evidence from other victims should not be admitted as\nother-acts evidence under this second scenario.\n      {¶ 178} More importantly, in the same hearing on Kaufman's motion for relief\n\nfrom prejudicial joinder, the trial court denied the state's motion to admit evidence of\nother acts through the testimony of RT, the victim not included in the original\nindictment. The state had requested the admission of evidence from the additional\nvictim for the same reason: in order to demonstrate that Kaufman committed additional\n\f                                                                                    - 50 -\n\n\noffenses in the same manner against the same type of victim. The trial court noted the\nextremely prejudicial nature of other-acts evidence during that hearing and during later\ndiscussion on the matter at trial. Given the trial court's decision on a different alleged\nvictim on the same other- acts issue, the trial court could not have denied Kaufman's\nmotion for relief from prejudicial joinder on the same grounds.\n      {¶ 179} Based on the foregoing, it is clear that joinder was not possible under the\n\nother-acts test. Thus the only way joinder would have been permissible in this case\nwould have been through satisfaction of the broader joinder test.\n      {¶ 180} The joinder test only requires that the evidence of each joined offense is\n\nsimple and distinct and ensures that a jury would be capable of segregating the proof\nrequired for each offense. Schaim at 62; State v. Brinkley, 105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-\nOhio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, at ¶37; State v. Mills (1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 362, 582\nN.E.2d 972.\n      {¶ 181} On this point, Kaufman argues that the evidence was not simple and\n\ndistinct because the inflammatory nature of the offenses prevented the jury from being\nable to segregate the evidence as it applied to each victim. The state counters that the\nevidence was simple and distinct because the testimony of each victim was separate\nand uncomplicated. The state relies primarily on State v. Bell, 7th Dist. No. 06 MA\n189, 2008-Ohio-3959, and In re Hollobaugh, 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797,\nto support this contention.\n      {¶ 182} It is true that Hollobaugh and Bell survived the \"simple and direct\n\nevidence\" analysis on the joinder issues raised therein. However, the joinder issue in\nboth of those cases was resolved under a plain-error standard of review due to waiver.\nHere, Kaufman timely moved for relief from prejudicial joinder and renewed his\nmotion repeatedly during trial in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Additionally,\n\f                                                                                    - 51 -\n\n\nBell and Hollobaugh are both factually distinguishable.\n      {¶ 183} In Bell, the presence of DNA evidence linked the perpetrator to the\n\noffenses. Bell at ¶21-22. Due to the immediate reporting of the victims and the\npresence of DNA evidence, the fact of the crimes in Bell was open and evident, which\nindicates that the testimony otherwise may have been admissible pursuant to the\nsecond scenario of the other-acts test as described above. In Hollobaugh, this court\nrelied on the fact that the case was tried under the Juvenile Rules, and at a bench trial\nrather than to a jury, in order to conclude that the risk of prejudice from multiple\ninflammatory accusations was low. Hollobaugh at ¶34. This court also pointed out the\ninextricable nature of the victims' testimony, which indicates that the testimony\notherwise may have been admissible pursuant to the first scenario of the other-acts test.\nId. at ¶35. Thus, although the factual backgrounds of these two cases may be similar\nto the one at hand, they do not support a finding of nonprejudicial joinder in this case\ndue to additional factors at play.\n      {¶ 184} Focusing entirely on the simplicity versus complexity of evidence, this\n\ncase could be appropriate for joinder at first blush. The offenses took place during\ndifferent time periods, in different places, against different victims. Each victim gave\nclear testimony as to his allegations, and the testimony offered by one victim did not\ncontradict or overlap with the testimony of the other victim. We have no reason to\npresume that the jury confused which offenses Kaufman committed against KC and\nwhich offenses Kaufman committed against JB.\n      {¶ 185} However, complexity of information is not the only consideration in this\n\nanalysis. This inquiry at hand \"focuses on whether the trier of fact is likely to consider\n'evidence of one [offense] as corroborative of the other.'\" State v. Wiles (1991), 59\nOhio St.3d 71, 571 N.E.2d 97, quoting Dunaway v. United States (C.A.D.C.1953), 205\n\f                                                                                 - 52 -\n\n\nF.2d 23, 27. The risk of the jury erroneously using one victim's evidence to\ncorroborate the other victim's testimony is not only possible through the confusion of\nfacts, but also through mistakenly presuming that the numerous similarities between\nunrelated offenses make it more likely that the offenses occurred.\n      {¶ 186} As stated in Torres, \"[j]oinder may be prejudicial when the offenses are\n\nunrelated and the evidence as to each is very weak, but it is otherwise when the\nevidence is direct and uncomplicated and can reasonably be separated as to each\noffense.\" (Emphasis added.) Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d at 343. In Schaim, the defendant\nhad been convicted of rape and gross sexual imposition stemming from offenses\nagainst his adopted daughter and a younger daughter. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 52.\nThe Ohio Supreme Court rejected the state's argument that the evidence against Schaim\nwas simple and direct enough to avoid prejudice. After pointing out that even the\nappellate court had confused the testimony of two of the victims, the Ohio Supreme\nCourt concluded that \"[g]iven the highly inflammatory nature of the offenses, the\nsimilarities between portions of [the victims'] testimony, and the fact that joinder\nallowed the state to circumvent the prohibition on other acts testimony, we conclude\nthat the defendant was prejudiced by the consolidated trial.\" Id. at 62-63. Thus,\nprejudice can occur with offenses which are highly inflammatory in nature and involve\nsimilar victim testimony. When such prejudice was demonstrated in Schaim, the trial\ncourt \"abused its discretion in refusing to sever these counts, particularly when its\nreasons for doing so were based on the fact that committing one of these crimes shows\na propensity to commit another – an inference that a jury is forbidden to draw.\" Id. at\n63. Although Kaufman's offenses against victims JB and KC were distinct in terms of\ntime and place, the similarities between the sexual abuses committed against each\nvictim, the inflammatory nature of the offenses, and the weakness of the evidence,\n\f                                                                                     - 53 -\n\n\nespecially in regards to JB, all indicate that the risk of prejudice from joinder in this\ncase was extremely high.\n      {¶ 187} Because there is an especially high danger that the jury may cumulate\n\nthe evidence of separate offenses that are jointly tried, \"both the trial court and counsel\nmust conduct such a trial with 'vigilant precision in speech and action far beyond that\nrequired in the ordinary trial.'\" State v. Garrett, 12th Dist. No. CA2008-08-075, 2009-\nOhio-5442, at ¶49, quoting Drew v. United States (C.A.D.C.1964), 331 F.2d 85, 94.\n      {¶ 188} Such \"precision in speech and action\" was not conducted here and is\n\nmost clearly exemplified by the state's following remarks during closing arguments:\n\"There are no eyewitnesses to these types of crimes. They happen in private with the\ndefendant or any other defendant, and the victim. But what you have here is even\nstronger than if there were eyewitnesses, because you have two independent victims,\nseparate and apart. * * * That is stronger than an eyewitness. That is independent\ncorroboration. They both said what happened to them, and they corroborate each\nother's stories, because what happened to one is essentially the mirror image of what\nhappened to the other.\" (Emphasis added). This statement elucidates the risk of\nprejudice from erroneously considering the separate evidence of JB and KC\ncumulatively, especially in light of the weakness of the evidence regarding victim JB.\nAs in Schaim, we find that Kaufman was prejudiced by the joinder of multiple victims,\ngiven the inflammatory nature of the offenses, the similar victim testimony, and the\nfact that the state was able to use the \"joinder test\" as a back door to present an \"other\nacts\" and propensity argument.\n      {¶ 189} Our conclusion is not meant to imply that any offenses of a sexual\n\nnature must be severed for fear that a fact-finder will erroneously use the evidence of\none crime to corroborate the other. A good example of when multiple sexual offenses\n\f                                                                                     - 54 -\n\n\ndo not call for severance is in this court's recent decision in State v. Dew, 7th Dist. No.\n08 MA 62, 2009-Ohio-6537. In Dew, the defendant requested separate trials for two\ngroups of victims, one group of victims who were minors at the time of the offenses\nand one group of victims who were adults. Id. at ¶6, 89. The circumstances of Dew's\noffenses against the two groups of victims, as well as his relationships with the two\ngroups of victims, were rather different: Dew had been a gymnastics coach for the\nminors, had a great amount of control over their lives, was an authority figure and even\na father figure to the victims, and groomed the victims over a number of years. Id. at\n¶5-22.     As for the adult victims, they received unnecessary and inappropriate\nchiropractic treatments by Dew. Id. at ¶31-40. There was no indication in Dew that\neach victim's allegation was used in order to argue that the victims' claims\nindependently corroborated one another and, by implication, made it more likely that\nthe offenses occurred. There was further indication that the jury was in fact able to\nsegregate the evidence regarding each victim, as the jury acquitted Dew on a number\nof counts. Id. at ¶ 95, citing State v. Schiebel (1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 88, 564 N.E.2d\n54.\n         {¶ 190} When keeping in mind the policies promoted by the rape-shield statute,\n\nwhich must be equally applied to protect both the victims and the defendants, the\ntendency for a jury to use one victim's testimony to corroborate the other's is too likely\ngiven the particular facts presented at Kaufman's trial. Although it may not have been\nan abuse of discretion for the trial court to initially deny Kaufman's motion for relief\nfrom prejudicial joinder, the trial court abused its discretion by summarily denying the\nmotion when Kaufman renewed his motion both after the state's case in chief and at the\nclose of trial. Accordingly, Kaufman's first assignment of error is meritorious.\n                          Remaining Assignments of Error\n\f                                                                                 - 55 -\n\n\n      {¶ 191} In his seventh, eighth and ninth assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 192} \"Appellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties\n\nSecured by the United States Constitution Amend. V & XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I, §§\n10 and 16 When the Trial Court Provided assistance to the State to Insure All Evidence\nof all Elements had been Presented.\"\n      {¶ 193} \"The Trial Court Abused its Discretion in Denying a Request for\n\nContinuance When Defense Counsel CanNot Provide Effective Assistance of Counsel\nand Additional time is Needed to Prepare.\"\n      {¶ 194} \"Appellant's Convictions and Sentences Are in Violation of the State\n\nand Federal Constitutions Because Appellant Was Denied the Effective Assistance of\nCounsel. U.S. CONST., amend. VI and XIV; OHIO CONST., art. I, §§1, 10 and 16.\"\n      {¶ 195} Given our disposition of Kaufman's first assignment of error, Kaufman's\n\nseventh, eighth, and ninth assignments of error are moot.\n      {¶ 196} In conclusion, Kaufman's assertions regarding sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, manifest weight of the evidence, cross-examination, jury instructions, expert\ntestimony, and prosecutorial misconduct are meritless. However, Kaufman's assertion\nof prejudicial joinder is well taken and his first assignment of error is meritorious.\nKaufman's remaining assignments of error are rendered moot due to the resolution of\nthe first assignment of error. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed\nand remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n                                                     Judgment accordingly.\n      DONOFRIO, J., concurs.\n      VUKOVICH, P.J., dissents.\n                               __________________\n\f                                                                                      - 56 -\n\n\n       VUKOVICH, Presiding Judge, dissenting:\n\n       {¶ 197} I dissent from the decision to reverse appellant’s conviction merely\n\nbecause sexual offenses committed against two child-victims were joined in one trial. I\nbelieve that the defendant has not met his burden of establishing prejudice under the\n“joinder test.” As a result, the “other acts” test is irrelevant. State v. Johnson (2000),\n88 Ohio St.3d 95, 109.\n       {¶ 198} As the majority points out, joinder is favored in the law. The joinder\n\ntest is “less stringent” than the “stricter” other-acts test. Id. at 109; State v. LeMar, 95\nOhio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, ¶50. Thus, policy reasons for the other-acts test\nshould not seep into the application of the joinder test.\n       {¶ 199} A claim of prejudice can be negated if the evidence of each joined\n\noffense is simple and direct. LeMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181 at ¶50, 52. Thus, where the\nproof of the joined offenses was separate and distinct and the jury was not likely to be\nconfused as to which evidence proved which offense, a trial court does not abuse its\ndiscretion in refusing to sever the offenses. State v. Coley (2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253,\n260.\n       {¶ 200} As for references to the strength of the evidence and the relatedness of\n\nthe offenses, I believe the majority misinterprets the following test:\n       {¶ 201} “Joinder may be prejudicial when the offenses are unrelated and the\n\nevidence as to each is very weak, but it is otherwise when the evidence is direct and\nuncomplicated and can reasonably be separated as to each offense.” State v. Torres\n(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343-344.\n       {¶ 202} This statement clearly means that if the second part of this sentence is\n\nsatisfied, there is no prejudice regardless of the first part. Here, the evidence was\n\f                                                                                     - 57 -\n\n\ndirect and uncomplicated and could be reasonably and readily separated as to each\noffense. See State v. Skatzes, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, ¶34. As the\nmajority acknowledges, the offenses against each of the two victims were separated in\ntime and place. Each victim testified as to their various allegations against appellant.\nThere was no apparent confusion as to which acts were committed against which\nvictim. The evidence was simple.\n      {¶ 203} In any event, I would not characterize the evidence as “very weak.” See\n\nTorres, 66 Ohio St.2d at 343-344. The trial court, whose discretion is being evaluated\nhere, heard and viewed the witnesses as they testified; this court did not. Furthermore,\nthe offenses are not unrelated as they involved the sexual abuse of two young male\nchildren by a person in a position of authority.\n      {¶ 204} Nor do I agree that the “inflammatory” nature of the allegations require\n\nseverance. In Johnson, the Supreme Court had no problem with joinder of a\nkidnapping/robbery victim with a death-penalty aggravated murder that occurred two\nmonths apart, focusing on the simplicity and directness of the evidence and the fact\nthat it was unlikely that the jury confused the evidence proving the separate charges.\nJohnson, 88 Ohio St.3d at 110. Cf. State v. Schaim (1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 63\n(finding that jury was not capable of segregating very similar evidence because even\nthe three appellate judges could not keep the facts of each victim straight). Finally, this\ncourt recently upheld joinder where minor gymnast victims and adult chiropractic\nvictims were joined for one trial where all allegations were sexual in nature. State v.\nDew, 7th Dist. No. 08MA62, 2009-Ohio-6537, ¶95-96.\n      {¶ 205} Accordingly, I would overrule appellant’s first assignment of error\n\ndealing with joinder. I would then overrule all other assignments of error (including\nnumbers seven through nine, which the majority found to be moot) and uphold\n\f                           - 58 -\n\n\nappellant’s convictions.\n\f",

Gene Donofrio\n\n\n                                                         Dated: March 31, 2010\n\n        DEGENARO, Judge.\n\f                                                                                          -2-\n\n\n       {¶ 1} This timely appeal comes for consideration upon the record in the trial\n\ncourt, the parties' briefs, and their oral arguments before this court. Appellant, Michael\nKaufman, appeals the March 25, 2008 decision of the Mahoning County Court of\nCommon Pleas that sentenced him to five consecutive life sentences and four\nconsecutive five-year sentences, subsequent to a jury finding him guilty of four counts\nof rape, four counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual\npenetration.\n       {¶ 2} Kaufman argues on appeal that his convictions were against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence and that the force specifications for his rape convictions were\nbased on insufficient evidence. Kaufman also contends that the trial court provided\nimproper jury instructions, erroneously allowed irrelevant expert testimony, improperly\nprovided assistance to the state, and limited Kaufman's right to cross-examine a\nwitness. Kaufman further contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying\nhis motion to continue, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, and\nthat the state committed prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, Kaufman argues that the\ntrial court erroneously allowed the improper joinder of victims and offenses.\n       {¶ 3} The force specifications for Kaufman's rape convictions were based on\n\nsufficient evidence under State v. Eskridge (1988), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nAlthough the evidence supporting Kaufman's convictions was not terribly strong given\nthe weakened credibility of one of the victims, his convictions were not against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence. The trial court's decisions regarding jury instructions,\nadmission of expert testimony, and limitation of cross-examination were proper.\nKaufman did not demonstrate that the state's objectionable statements deprived him of\nhis right to a fair trial. Finally, the trial court's decision not to sever the charges against\nKaufman for the two separate victims was an abuse of discretion, where the testimony\n\f                                                                                     -3-\n\n\nof each victim would not have been admissible in separate trials under Evid.R. 404(B),\nand the offenses committed against each victim were too similar and inflammatory to\nrealistically avoid fostering the erroneous belief that the distinct offenses corroborated\none another. Kaufman's remaining assignments of error regarding assistance to the\nstate, denial of motions to continue ,and ineffective assistance of counsel are moot.\n      {¶ 4} Accordingly, the trial court's decision will be reversed and remanded for\n\nnew trials.\n                            Facts and Procedural History\n      {¶ 5} On November 1, 2007, a grand jury indicted Kaufman on eight counts of\n\nrape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b); five counts of gross sexual imposition, in\nviolation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4); and one count of felonious sexual penetration, in\nviolation of R.C. 2907.12(A)(1)(b). The counts encompassed offenses against three\ndifferent victims, JB, DC, and KC. JB was born on October 4, 1987, DC was born on\nApril 22, 1991, and KC was born on December 21, 1992, and all victims were minors\nunder the age of 13 at the time of the indicted offenses.\n      {¶ 6} Kaufman was charged with committing offenses against the three victims\n\nas follows: For offenses against victim JB between October 4, 1995, and October 3,\n1998, Kaufman was charged with three of the counts of rape, three counts of gross\nsexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual penetration. For offenses against\nvictim DC between January 1, 2002, and September 7, 2002, Kaufman was charged\nwith one count of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition. For offenses against\nvictim KC between January 1, 2001, and August 31, 2003, Kaufman was charged with\nthe remaining four counts of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition.\n      {¶ 7} On November 7, 2007, Kaufman entered a plea of not guilty, and the trial\n\ncourt appointed John B. Juhasz as counsel after finding Kaufman to be indigent. The\n\f                                                                                     -4-\n\n\ntrial court scheduled the trial for December 17, 2007. On December 6, 2007, Kaufman\nfiled a motion to continue, noting that counsel had sustained a back injury on\nNovember 13, 2007, and that counsel for the state had failed to complete its responses\nto discovery requests. The trial court granted Kaufman's motion and the trial was\nrescheduled to take place on January 7, 2008. On December 20, 2007, Kaufman filed\nanother motion to continue due to a conflict with another trial. The trial court\nrescheduled the trial to January 22, 2008. On January 9, 2008, the parties filed a joint\nmotion for continuance due to scheduling conflicts, which the trial court overruled. On\nJanuary 16, 2008, Kaufman filed another motion to continue, stating that counsel's\nback injury, untimely discovery responses from the state, and investigation difficulties\nrendered counsel unable to provide effective assistance of counsel at such a close trial\ndate. During a January 18, 2008 hearing on Kaufman's motion, the trial court asked\ndefense counsel to pick a continuance date well in the future in order to ensure that\nsuch time constraints would not cause any further problems with this trial. The trial\ncourt granted Kaufman's motion and continued the trial to March 17, 2008.\n      {¶ 8} On February 19, 2008, the state filed a supplemental disclosure of\n\nevidence regarding a fourth victim, RT, not included in the indictment. On March 3,\n2008, Kaufman filed a motion for relief from prejudicial joinder, asking for three\nseparate trials for the three separate victims. Kaufman also filed another motion to\ncontinue the trial. The trial court overruled the motion to continue and set a hearing for\nthe motion for relief from prejudicial joinder. Additionally, Kaufman filed a motion to\ndismiss charges 7, 8, and 11 for lack of jurisdiction, because the offenses were alleged\nto have occurred outside of Mahoning County. The state filed a motion to introduce\nevidence of other acts, requesting that the trial court allow testimony from RT, the\nvictim not included in the indictment.\n\f                                                                                  -5-\n\n\n      {¶ 9} Subsequent to a hearing on March 11, 2008, the trial court denied\n\nKaufman's request to sever trials and denied the state's motion to admit other acts\nevidence regarding the fourth victim. The trial court sustained Kaufman's motion to\ndismiss three of the charges, which left 11 charges against two victims remaining on\nthe indictment. Kaufman repeated his request for severance throughout his trial, but\neach request was overruled.\n      {¶ 10} On March 12, 2008, the state filed a motion in limine, asking the trial\n\ncourt to allow KC to testify about acts that had occurred outside the trial court's\njurisdiction. On March 13, 2008, Kaufman filed a supplemental motion to continue,\nrepeating his request for an enlarged amount of time to prepare. The trial court\noverruled both motions.\n      {¶ 11} On March 17, 2008, the state filed a second motion in limine, asking the\n\ntrial court to disallow any reference to a 1993 report by JB's mother of suspected\nsexual abuse of JB by an unspecified person and a 2000 report that JB had molested his\nlittle brother, RT, which the trial court sustained. The state filed a third motion in\nlimine, asking to admit the testimony of DC (the third victim in the dismissed counts)\nas other-acts evidence and asking that KC be permitted to testify about acts not\nincluded in the indictment for the purpose of explaining the background behind the\noffenses actually charged. The trial court disallowed the other-acts evidence of DC,\nbut sustained the state's motion regarding KC.\n      {¶ 12} During the course of the proceedings, the trial court dismissed Counts 1\n\nand 13, due to errors in the indictment. Pursuant to Kaufman's motion, the indictment\nwas amended to renumber the remaining nine counts. The counts remaining were as\nfollows: For offenses against victim JB between October 4, 1995, and October 3,\n1998, Kaufman was charged with two of the counts of rape, three counts of gross\n\f                                                                                     -6-\n\n\nsexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual penetration (Counts 1 through 5\nand 9); and for offenses against victim KC between January 1, 2002, and August 31,\n2003, Kaufman was charged with two counts of rape and one count of gross sexual\nimposition (Counts 6 through 8). During proceedings, the state successfully moved the\ntrial court to provide an Eskridge definition of force in the jury instructions and to\ninclude the additional finding of force or threat of force for each of the rape and\nfelonious-sexual-penetration charges. See Eskridge, 38 Ohio St.3d at 58.\n      {¶ 13} At trial, the state presented the testimony of KC, Karen, JB, Officer\n\nSuzanne Doni-Ellis, and Dr. Paul McPherson. Kaufman presented his own testimony\nand the testimony of Officer Doug Flara, Donna, and Tracey. An initial explanation\nof the parties' relationships with each other will clarify the parties' testimony.\n      {¶ 14} Tracey was married to Frederick from approximately 1987 to 1991. The\n\ncouple had a son, JB, on October 4, 1987. Tracey was married to Reginald from\napproximately 1995 to 1999, though they gave birth to a son, RT, in 1994. Reginald\nworked at Long Bar Trucking (“LBT”). Kaufman also worked at LBT, starting in\n1991. Tracey and Kaufman were married in 2001 and had a son in 2005. Kaufman's\nmother, Donna, lives in Boardman. Donna's sister, Karen, lives in Wisconsin, but\nvisited Donna in Boardman during most summers. On past visits to Donna, Karen\nwould bring her grandchildren and step-grandchildren along, one of whom is KC, born\nDecember 21, 1992.\n      {¶ 15} KC testified that he met Kaufman when Kaufman was visiting family in\n\nWisconsin in 2002 and that he saw Kaufman three other times during KC's short visits\nto Donna's house in Ohio during the summers of 2002 to 2004.\n      {¶ 16} KC testified that he and other family members met up with Kaufman in\n\nthe early summer of 2002 and stayed in a motel together, with the males staying in one\n\f                                                                                  -7-\n\n\nroom and the females in another room. KC testified that as he was getting out of\nKaufman's car in a parking lot of the motel, he scratched the car next to him with the\ndoor of Kaufman's car. KC stated that Kaufman \"said that he would call the sheriff\nand tell them that I scratched the car next to me, or I could receive punishment.\"\nDuring that night at the motel, Kaufman woke KC and \"said it was time for the\npunishment,\" by which he meant performing oral sex on Kaufman. KC also stated that\nhe did not tell anyone what happened at that time because he was scared that Kaufman\n\"might do something\" or get KC in trouble for scratching the car.\n      {¶ 17} During the summer of 2002 and 2003, when KC was in Ohio visiting\n\nextended family at Donna's house, Kaufman would get KC alone and continue the\n\"punishment,\" which involved striking KC's testicles, digitally penetrating KC's anus,\nor performing fellatio on one another. There were eight or nine people, along with two\nlarge dogs, staying in Donna's house during KC's family visits. KC testified that\nKaufman got KC alone in the attic, the basement, or the second floor bathroom in order\nto commit the abuse. On cross-examination, KC stated that he did not remember\nKaufman locking any doors when they were in the basement or the attic, but he\nremembered Kaufman locking the second-story bathroom door.\n      {¶ 18} KC testified to three or more incidents of Kaufman striking his testicles,\n\ntwo instances of digital-anal penetration, two instances of Kaufman performing fellatio\non KC, and one instance of KC performing fellatio on Kaufman in 2002. KC also\ntestified that Kaufman once used a hand-held video recorder to tape KC in the garage\nwhile Kaufman was touching KC's penis. KC testified to two instances of Kaufman\nstriking his testicles, one instance of digital-anal penetration, and two instances of\nfellatio in 2003.\n      {¶ 19} KC testified that at first, he did not tell anyone about what Kaufman did\n\f                                                                                     -8-\n\n\nduring the summer incidents because KC was scared and did not want to get in trouble.\nShortly before the family's summer 2004 visit, KC told his step-siblings about the\nabuse.\n         {¶ 20} KC testified that during the summer 2004 visit, Kaufman asked KC if he\n\nhad told anyone about their sexual interactions and that Kaufman \"seemed kind of\nangry.\" KC denied telling anyone because he was afraid of what Kaufman would do.\nKC and his step-brother, JT, took a tape recorder from Karen and Donna and used it to\ntry to catch an instance of Kaufman's abuse, but the adults repeatedly found the\nrecorder and took it back. JT told Karen about the abuse during this visit, and Karen\ntook the grandchildren back to Wisconsin.\n         {¶ 21} On cross-examination, KC testified that Kaufman did not threaten to hurt\n\nhim. KC testified that Karen was the adult in charge of him during the summer trips to\nDonna's house, not Kaufman, and that KC called Kaufman \"Uncle Mikey.\" However,\nKC also testified that Kaufman was an authority figure in Donna's house.\n         {¶ 22} KC testified that Kaufman had been driving a red Firebird during his 2002\n\ntrip to Wisconsin. When asked about the purpose of Kaufman's Wisconsin visit, which\nwas to pick up furniture from Kaufman's recently deceased grandmother, KC agreed\nthat Kaufman would not be able to move a lot of furniture in a Firebird. KC stated that\nhe did not remember what car Kaufman was driving when KC scratched the car door in\nthe parking lot of the motel. KC did not remember Tracey's presence during the 2002\nWisconsin trip.\n         {¶ 23} When KC was interviewed by social workers in Wisconsin after the 2004\n\ndisclosure, he did not tell them about the video-taping incident in the garage of Donna's\nhouse.\n         {¶ 24} Karen testified that she would visit her sister, Donna, in Ohio during\n\f                                                                                    -9-\n\n\nsummer breaks from school and that she brought KC along in 2002 to 2004. Karen\nbrought a tape recorder with her during the 2004 trip, and after it disappeared a few\ntimes, one of the grandchildren disclosed Kaufman's abuse of KC. The adults\nconfronted Kaufman about the abuse, and Kaufman denied the allegations.\n      {¶ 25} On cross-examination, Karen described renting motel rooms for family\n\ngatherings in Wisconsin in February and April 2002, but did not remember whether the\nfamily had all stayed together in motel rooms during Kaufman's trip to Wisconsin to\npick up furniture. On redirect examination, Karen stated that when the family stayed at\na motel, they always had one room for the women and one room for the men.\n      {¶ 26} Kaufman did not live at or stay overnight at Donna's house when KC was\n\nvisiting, but he would spend time there with the family after work, during weekends,\nand sometimes in the morning. He would come over to the house by himself or with\nTracey. When describing the layout and sleeping arrangements at Donna's house,\nKaren noted that the door to the second-story bathroom did not shut all the way. Karen\ndescribed Donna's house as a little hectic when all the adults, children, and dogs are\nthere. Karen testified that she had authority over her grandchildren when she brought\nthem on the trips to Donna's house, but also stated that all of the adults were authority\nfigures for the children at Donna's house.\n      {¶ 27} JB, born October 4, 1987, testified that he and Kaufman were good\n\nfriends before Tracey and Kaufman \"got together.\" Tracey, Reginald, and Kaufman all\nworked at LBT, and Tracey became friends with Kaufman while Reginald was away\non truck-driving jobs. Tracey married Reginald when JB was six, divorced when JB\nwas ten, and married Kaufman when JB was fifteen.\n      {¶ 28} Tracey frequently sent JB to Kaufman's house to spend time with him.\n\nDuring those visits, Kaufman was the only adult in the house and was in charge of JB.\n\f                                                                                  - 10 -\n\n\nWhen JB stayed with Kaufman in south Youngstown, Kaufman would pick JB up at\nhis school in Niles. JB sometimes stayed with Kaufman only during the day, then\nstarted staying with him over weekends, and then overnights during the week.\n         {¶ 29} JB testified that his friendship with Kaufman became inappropriate when\n\nhe was approximately five or six years old. JB stated that inappropriate sexual conduct\nbegan when he was six or seven years old and physical abuse began when he was ten.\nKaufman began to digitally penetrate JB's anus starting at the age of eight, and did so\nat least once every three months, usually when JB was in Kaufman's bathroom.\nBetween the ages of eight and 11, JB estimated that Kaufman had digitally penetrated\nhis anus 12 to 14 times and had JB perform fellatio two times. JB specified that one\ninstance of fellatio happened in the spring of 1997 and the other during the fall of\n1998.\n         {¶ 30} On cross-examination, JB testified that Kaufman began to touch JB\n\ninappropriately around the age of six and that the first instance occurred at Donna's\nhouse. JB testified that he told his mother about Kaufman rubbing his buttocks right\nafterwards, but Tracey did nothing. JB also testified that Kaufman touched him\ninappropriately at age 11 while washing him after JB had broken his arm in a bicycle\naccident at a location in New Springfield, Ohio.\n         {¶ 31} JB testified that he only disclosed Kaufman's abuse recently because he\n\nwants to become comfortable with himself so that he can start his own family. JB did\nnot report the sexual abuse to anyone besides Tracey and the police, though he said that\nReginald was made aware of Kaufman's physical abuse of JB at some unspecified\npoint.\n         {¶ 32} JB first spoke with the police in November 2006 and made an official\n\nreport of sexual abuse to the police in June 2007, after having been out of Ohio. JB\n\f                                                                                    - 11 -\n\n\nadmitted that he did not report the instances of fellatio or the inappropriate touching in\nNew Springfield to the police and said that he did not feel comfortable reporting all of\nit. JB admitted that he had told the police that the inappropriate touching started at age\nfive rather than six, but said he had just given the police an approximate date and was\nvery ill during the reporting process. On further cross, JB agreed that the touching\nstarted at age five. JB stated that Kaufman began penetrating his anus when he was six\nor seven years old, at Kaufman's house on Berkshire in Youngstown. On further cross,\nJB agreed that no anal penetration occurred prior to 1997 (which would have been\nwhen he was nine and ten years old). On redirect, JB testified that Kaufman's\ninappropriate touching began at age five or six, anal penetration began at age eight, and\nthe sexual abuse stopped by the time JB was twelve.\n      {¶ 33} Officer Suzanne Doni-Ellis of the Youngstown Police Department\n\ntestified that JB filed a police report with her on June 4, 2007, and stated that\nKaufman's inappropriate touching began at age five, anal penetration began at age\neight, and the abuse stopped by the time JB was 11 or twelve. Ellis did not gather\nphysical evidence due to the remote dates of abuse. During her investigation, Ellis\nprocured reports from police departments in Boardman and Wisconsin regarding KC's\n2004 allegations.\n      {¶ 34} Dr. Paul McPherson was proffered by the state as an expert regarding\n\nallegations of sex abuse by children. McPherson did not interview the victims and\ntestified about his general academic knowledge and professional experience with child\nsexual-abuse victims. McPherson testified that it is common for child victims to delay\ndisclosure of the abuse or to partially disclose the abuse and that it is not common for\nanal penetration to result in permanent scars. Kaufman cross-examined McPherson on\nstatistics regarding false allegations and hypothetical questions about anal trauma.\n\f                                                                                - 12 -\n\n\n      {¶ 35} Once the state rested, Kaufman renewed his motion for relief from\n\nprejudicial joinder and entered a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, both of which the\ntrial court denied. For Kaufman's case in chief, Officer Doug Flara of the Boardman\nPolice Department Youth and Family Services Division testified that he received a\nreport of sexual abuse from the Milwaukee Department of Child Welfare regarding KC\nin 2004. Flara interviewed Donna and Kaufman and spoke with Jennifer (KC's step-\nmother) via telephone. Flara took the case to the prosecutor's office in 2004, but no\naction was taken on the case until JB's report in 2007.\n      {¶ 36} Donna testified that she moved to Boardman, Ohio in 1996 and lived in\n\nMichigan prior to that. Donna testified that Kaufman drove her up to Wisconsin for\nher mother's funeral (in February 2002) in her white Buick. Kaufman and KC were\nboth at the bereavement luncheon. Donna stayed up in Wisconsin to deal with her\nmother's estate, until Kaufman returned in late April 2002 with Tracey, in a moving\ntruck. After a group family dinner, Kaufman and Tracey drove KC and two other boys\nto the motel where they were staying. Donna testified that the family got two rooms\nand that Kaufman, Tracey, KC, and KC's step-brother slept in one room. The door\nbetween the two adjoining motel rooms was left open, and Donna did not notice\nanything strange that night.\n      {¶ 37} When Karen and the grandchildren came to visit Donna in the summers of\n\n2002 to 2004, eight people stayed at Donna's house, and additional people, including\nKaufman and Tracey, would spend time there during the day. Donna testified that the\nbathroom doors at her house could not shut due to mistakes made during remodeling.\nDuring the family visits to Donna's house in 2002 to 2004, Donna had not noticed any\nstrange behavior and was shocked by KC's allegations in 2004.\n      {¶ 38} Tracey testified that she was married to Frederick from 1987 to 1991, and\n\f                                                                                 - 13 -\n\n\nhad one child with him, JB. She had one child, RT, with Reginald in 1994 and was\nmarried to Reginald from 1995 to 1999.\n       {¶ 39} Tracey testified that she met Kaufman in early 1996 and that she began to\n\nwork for LBT in late 1996. Tracey testified that Kaufman met JB in the fall of 1997\nand that she would send JB to stay with Kaufman when she was having marital\ndifficulties with Reginald. JB did not report any abuse to her, and Tracey first found\nout about the abuse when JB made the police report in 2007. JB would stay with\nKaufman a few times a month, only on the weekends, and Kaufman never drove JB to\nschool in Niles.\n       {¶ 40} In 2000, Tracey moved in to Kaufman's house on Berkshire. Tracey\n\ntestified that the shower at Kaufman's house did not work and was never fixed. Tracey\nand Kaufman were married in 2001 and had a son in 2005.\n       {¶ 41} Tracey provided testimony identical to Donna's regarding the family trip\n\nto Wisconsin in late April 2002, though Tracey stated that the door between the two\nadjoining motel rooms did not stay open the entire time. Tracey stated that she got up\nduring the night at the motel and did not notice anything strange.\n       {¶ 42} In Tracey's description of the family visits to Donna's house in the\n\nsummers of 2002 to 2004, Tracey said that she stayed close to Kaufman the whole\ntime, because she did not know his family very well.\n       {¶ 43} Kaufman testified that he started working at LBT in 1991. He bought his\n\nhouse on Berkshire Drive in Youngstown in April 1996. Kaufman's exhibit 14, an\ninspection report on the Berkshire house, stated that there was one bathroom in the\nhouse, and that \"Shower head is damaged. Shower head replacement is recommended.\nNo water pressure to shower. (Repairs needed.)\" Kaufman never fixed the shower and\ntestified that it still does not work.\n\f                                                                                   - 14 -\n\n\n      {¶ 44} Kaufman testified that he met JB in the fall of 1997, when JB was nine or\n\nten. Kaufman testified that he still lived in Austintown when he first started spending\ntime with JB and would have JB stay the night one or two times a month. Kaufman\nhad a \"big brother/little brother\" relationship with JB from 1997 to 1999 and started to\nspend time with JB and Tracey \"as a family\" in 1999.\n      {¶ 45} Kaufman's testimony addressed JB's claim that Kaufman had touched him\n\ninappropriately after JB had broken his arm in a bicycle accident. Kaufman stated that\nthe bike accident occurred during a camping trip in Pennsylvania and that JB had never\nbeen to New Springfield, Ohio. Kaufman's testimony otherwise generally duplicated\nmost of the defense testimony already presented, and Kaufman denied ever having\ntouched either victim inappropriately.\n      {¶ 46} At the close of trial, Kaufman renewed his motions for acquittal and relief\n\nfrom prejudicial joinder, which the trial court denied. After a day of deliberations, the\njury returned a guilty verdict for each of the nine counts against Kaufman. On March\n24, 2008, the trial court held a sentencing hearing and imposed four consecutive life\nsentences for the rape convictions, an additional consecutive life sentence for the\nfelonious-sexual-penetration conviction, and four consecutive five-year sentences for\nthe gross-sexual-imposition convictions.\n      {¶ 47} Kaufman timely filed the present appeal, asserting ten assignments of\n\nerror. We will address Kaufman's assignments of error in an order that facilitates our\nanalysis of the issues raised therein.\n                                Insufficient Evidence\n      {¶ 48} In his fourth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 49} \"Appellant Was Denied Due Process and the Liberties Secured by the\n\nUnited States Constitution and Ohio Const.

Jenks at 273.\n       {¶ 52} Kaufman was convicted of four counts of rape of a person under 13, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), the elements of which are not argued in this\nassignment of error. Pursuant to the version of R.C. 2907.02(B) in effect at the time of\nthe commission of the offenses, a conviction of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) is sentenced as\na first degree felony, but carries a mandatory life sentence if there is a finding that the\noffender \"purposely compels the victim to submit by force or threat of force.\"\n       {¶ 53} The force element is defined as follows: \"Force means any violence,\n\ncompulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or\n\f                                                                                    - 16 -\n\n\nthing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(1).

Thus, the context of the\nrape will also affect our inferences regarding the additional element of force or threats\nof force. In the case of a child victim, a person in a position of authority over the\nvictim can be convicted of rape with the force specification \"without evidence of\nexpress threat of harm or evidence of significant physical restraint.\" Dye at syllabus.\n      {¶ 54} Kaufman argues that his rape convictions were based on insufficient\n\nevidence because the state did not provide evidence that Kaufman had used force or\nthreats of force against either victim. Kaufman also contends that the inference of\npsychological force in Eskridge and Dye does not apply in this case because Kaufman\nwas not an authority or parent figure for either of the victims. Kaufman contends that\nhe was merely \"an adult who had met these boys.\"\n      {¶ 55} It is true that the law does not impute an authoritative relationship merely\n\nbecause the victim is a child and the defendant is an adult. See State v. Drayer, 10th\nDist. No. 03AP-1033, 2004-Ohio-5061, at ¶31, vacated on other grounds by State v.\nDrayer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3688088\"><a href=\"/opinion/3940333/state-v-drayer/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2004-Ohio-6120, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3688088\"><a href=\"/opinion/3940333/state-v-drayer/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. However, an adult\nneed not be the child's parent in order to establish that the child felt obligated to obey\nhim. Dye, supra. In Dye, the defendant was merely the victim's neighbor, but there\nwas direct proof that the defendant was acting in loco parentis, as there was testimony\n\f                                                                                   - 17 -\n\n\nthat the victim's mother specifically instructed the victim to obey the defendant when in\nhis charge or else she would bring him home. Dye, 82 Ohio St.3d at 328-329. In other\ncases, the child's belief that he must obey the adult has been established even without\nspecific instruction from the victim's parent that the defendant was to be obeyed in\nplace of the parent. See, e.g., State v. Milam, 8th Dist. No. 86268, 2006-Ohio-4742\n(defendant was in a position of authority with regard to the victim because he was the\nfather of one of the victim's friends, the victim spent many nights at the defendant's\nhome, and the victim testified that the defendant was \"in charge\" of him while at the\ndefendant's home); State v. Haschenburger, 7th Dist. No. 05 MA 192, 2007-Ohio-1562\n(defendant manipulated his relationship as a family friend to condition the victim to\nthink that she should comply with his demands).\n      {¶ 56} In this case, Kaufman had a long-standing relationship with JB's mother,\n\nfirst as a friend, then live-in boyfriend, then husband, though the marriage occurred\nafter the dates of the charged offenses for JB. JB's mother testified that she would send\nJB to stay overnight at Kaufman's house when she was experiencing difficulties with\nher previous husband, Reginald. JB testified that he would have to obey Kaufman if\nKaufman told him what to do. JB did not respect Kaufman as an authority figure, but\nspecified that Kaufman was in charge when JB was in his care. JB stated that he was\nfrightened of Kaufman.\n      {¶ 57} In addition to ongoing incidents of sexual touching and digital-anal\n\npenetration, JB testified that on two specific occasions, during the time periods of each\nof rape counts, \"I was in the process of getting out of the shower, and [Kaufman]\ngrabbed me and pulled my head down * * * [and] I was forced to suck his penis.\" JB\nalso testified to a specific incident, during the time period of the second rape count,\nwhere Kaufman both physically assaulted JB and forcefully penetrated his anus for an\n\f                                                                                   - 18 -\n\n\nextended period of time, causing him to bleed.\n         {¶ 58} The foregoing testimony indicates that Kaufman was an authority figure\n\nto JB. He was repeatedly entrusted to care for JB by JB's mother, and JB felt obligated\nto obey Kaufman. The sexual acts occurred either while JB was under Kaufman's sole\nsupervision, or during a period when Kaufman was living with JB and his mother,\nTracey. JB repeatedly described being \"forced\" by Kaufman to perform sexual acts\nwith him and described at least one incident of Kaufman inflicting physical violence on\nJB in conjunction with a sexual act. The state therefore presented sufficient evidence\nthat Kaufman was in a position of authority over JB, that JB's will was overcome by\nfear or duress, and that JB's will was overcome on at least one occasion by physical\nviolence. Given the totality of the evidence presented by the state, reasonable minds\ncould conclude that the rape counts against JB were committed with force or threat of\nforce.\n         {¶ 59} As for the force specifications on Counts 6 and 8, Kaufman did not have a\n\nsimilar long-standing relationship with KC. KC testified that he had first met Kaufman\nwhen Kaufman was visiting in Wisconsin in 2002 and saw Kaufman three other times,\nduring KC's short visits to Kaufman's mother's house in Ohio during the summers of\n2002 to 2004. Kaufman's mother was KC's step-mother's aunt, and KC called Kaufman\n\"Uncle Mikey.\" KC testified that Kaufman was not one of the adults responsible for\ntelling KC what he could or could not do when he was staying at Kaufman's mother's\nhouse. However, KC also testified that Kaufman was an authority figure in Kaufman's\nmother's house. Kaufman did not live at or stay overnight at his mother's house when\nKC was there, but he would visit with the family after work or during weekends. KC's\nstep-grandmother, Karen, testified that \"all of the adults\" were the authority figures at\nDonna's house when the family got together there.\n\f                                                                                    - 19 -\n\n\n      {¶ 60} KC described the first incident in 2002 with Kaufman, which was outside\n\nthe jurisdiction of the trial court and not included in the counts in this case, but\nexplained the background of his relationship with Kaufman. KC testified that as he\nwas getting out of Kaufman's car in a parking lot of the motel where they were staying\nand scratched the car next to him with the door of Kaufman's car, Kaufman \"said that\nhe would call the sheriff and tell them that I scratched the car next to me, or I could\nreceive punishment [from Kaufman]. And I was scared because I didn't really want to\nbe in trouble with the police, so -- I was a little kid. I didn't know. And so I chose the\npunishment because I thought it would be a lot easier. I didn't know what it was.\"\nDuring that night at the motel, Michael woke KC and \"said it was time for the\npunishment,\" which was to perform oral sex on Kaufman. KC testified that he was\nafraid of Kaufman. KC also stated that he did not tell anyone what happened at that\ntime because he was scared that Kaufman \"might do something\" or get KC in trouble\nfor scratching the car.\n      {¶ 61} During the summer of 2002 and 2003, when KC was in Ohio visiting his\n\nextended family, Kaufman would get KC alone and continue the \"punishment,\" which\ninvolved striking KC's testicles, digitally penetrating KC's anus, or KC and Kaufman\nperforming fellatio on one another. KC testified that it was Kaufman who removed\nKC's pants during each incident. KC stated that he did what Kaufman said because he\nwas scared and did not want to get in trouble. KC also said that he did not tell anyone\nabout what Kaufman did during the summer 2002 incidents because KC was scared.\nShortly before the summer 2004 visit, KC told his step-siblings about the abuse. KC\ntestified that Kaufman asked KC during his 2004 visit if he had told anyone about their\nsexual interactions and that Kaufman \"seemed kind of angry.\" KC denied telling\nanyone because he was afraid of what Kaufman would do.\n\f                                                                                   - 20 -\n\n\n      {¶ 62} Based solely on their distant familial relationship, the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to allow the court to use the Eskridge inference of psychological force.\nSee 38 Ohio St.3d at 58. Kaufman was never in charge of caring for KC, nor was he\nacting in loco parentis at any point, and was instead merely one of the adults at the\nhouse during family gatherings. However, Kaufman placed himself in a position of\nauthority over KC when he said that he would punish KC for damaging the car and that\nif KC did not acquiesce to Kaufman's punishment, then Kaufman would get him into\neven more trouble. This is coupled with the fact that KC was of tender years and small\nfor his age during the two offenses charged.\n      {¶ 63} Additionally, Kaufman did in fact physically harm KC by repeatedly\n\nstriking him in the testicles. It appears that striking his testicles was not intended to\nsubdue KC for the purpose of committing other sexual acts, but was one of the sexual\nacts in and of itself. Nonetheless, the physical violence, the age disparity between the\nparties, the threats of worse punishment, and Kaufman's assertion of authority as an\nadult who had the power to discipline KC all indicate that KC's will was overcome by\nfear and duress, and he felt compelled to submit. Given the totality of the evidence\npresented by the state, reasonable minds could conclude that the rape counts against\nKC were committed with force or threat of force.\n      {¶ 64} The force element in each of Kaufman's rape convictions was based on\n\nsufficient evidence; thus, Kaufman's fourth assignment of error is meritless.\n                          Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n      {¶ 65} In his third of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 66} \"The trial court denied Appellant due process under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment in that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence and\nthe jury's verdict was inconsistent with the evidence and testimony presented.\"\n\f                                                                                     - 21 -\n\n\n       {¶ 67} Kaufman argues that the convictions were against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence due to the number of contradictions in testimonial evidence and the lack\nof physical evidence of the crimes.\n       {¶ 68} When a court conducts a manifest-weight analysis, it weighs all of the\n\nevidence and reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of each witness, and\ndetermines whether the fact-finders clearly lost their way in resolving conflicts in the\nevidence to the point that they \"created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the\nconviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\" Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at\n387. The factors that a reviewing court may consider in a manifest-weight analysis\ninclude whether the evidence was incredible; whether the evidence was uncontradicted;\nwhether a witness was impeached; what was not proved; the certainty of the evidence;\nthe reliability of the evidence; whether any witness's testimony was self-serving; and\nwhether the evidence was vague, uncertain, conflicting, fragmentary, or illogical.

See In re Hollobaugh, 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797, at ¶21. The\nlack of physical evidence in this case is understandable, given that this case was\nprosecuted years after the abusive acts were alleged to have occurred.\n      {¶ 72} As for KC's testimony, Kaufman points to conflicting testimony about\n\ncertain details during the first instance of abuse in Wisconsin and whether or not the\nbathroom door at Donna's house could be shut or locked.\n      {¶ 73} KC testified that Kaufman had been driving a red Firebird during a trip to\n\nWisconsin, but defense witnesses testified that Kaufman had been driving a moving\ntruck and a white Buick. There also were conflicts as to which trips to Wisconsin were\nmade, when they were made, and which people stayed in which hotel rooms. These\nconflicts surround events that were not charged against Kaufman and were only\ndescribed as background information. Thus, these conflicts were not material to the\ncase against Kaufman and at most would have spoken to KC's overall credibility.\n      {¶ 74} KC described Kaufman as having abused him during the weeks that he\n\nvisited Donna in Ohio and described the abuse as happening in the attic, the basement,\nand the second-floor bathroom. On cross-examination, KC stated that he did not\nremember Kaufman locking any doors when they were in the basement or the attic, but\nthat he remembered Kaufman locking the second-story bathroom door. Witnesses for\nboth the state and the defense testified that the door to the second-story bathroom did\nnot shut all the way and could not be locked.\n\f                                                                                   - 23 -\n\n\n      {¶ 75} Kaufman has pointed out a few inconsistencies in KC's testimony, but KC\n\notherwise gave detailed testimony about all of the events pertinent to the case and\nprovided consistent testimony as to the facts that satisfied the elements of the offenses\ncharged against Kaufman. Taking into account inconsistencies or conflicting evidence\nwhile weighing the credibility of an individual witness is well within the province of\nthe jury. Kaufman has not demonstrated that the evidence as it pertained to KC was so\ninconsistent that no reasonable jury could have believed him. The convictions\nregarding KC were therefore not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n      {¶ 76} As for JB's testimony, Kaufman points to inconsistencies in his\n\ndescription of events that occurred before, during, and after the time periods of the\ncharges in order to argue that JB's overall credibility was undermined. Kaufman also\nspecifically argues that the conflicting testimony of other witnesses as to when JB first\nmet Kaufman rendered Counts 3 and 9 to be factually impossible and therefore against\nthe manifest weight of the evidence. The three time periods of the convictions are\nOctober 1995 to 1996 (Counts 3 and 9), October 1996 to 1997 (Counts 1 and 4), and\nOctober 1997 to 1998 (Counts 2 and 5).\n      {¶ 77} JB testified that Kaufman began to touch JB inappropriately around the\n\nage of 6 (October 1993 to 1994) and that the first instance occurred at Kaufman's\nmother's (Donna) house. Kaufman and Donna testified that Donna lived in Michigan\nat that time and did not move to Ohio until 1996. JB also testified that Kaufman\ntouched him inappropriately at age 11 (October 1998 to 1999) while washing him after\nJB had broken his arm in a bicycle accident at a location in New Springfield, Ohio.\nTracey and Kaufman testified that JB had fractured his arm in a bicycle accident during\na camping trip in Pennsylvania and that JB had not been to New Springfield.\nAdditionally, Kaufman points out that JB agreed during cross-examination that no anal\n\f                                                                                - 24 -\n\n\npenetration occurred before 1997. However, JB also testified on direct and redirect\nexamination that the first instance of anal penetration occurred when he was eight\nyears old, which would have been between October 1995 and October 1996.\n      {¶ 78} JB testified that his mother Tracey met Kaufman through LBT. JB's ex-\n\nstepfather, Reginald, worked for LBT. No one testified as to when they thought\nReginald started working at LBT, though he started some time before Tracey did, and\npossibly before Kaufman did, though the testimony is unclear. Kaufman started\nworking at LBT in 1991. JB did not testify as to when he thought his mother started\nworking at LBT, though he said that Tracey and Kaufman became friends while\nReginald was \"on the road\" working for LBT.\n      {¶ 79} Tracey testified that she met Kaufman in early 1996, that she began to\n\nwork for LBT in late 1996, and that she became friends with Kaufman at that time.\nTracey and Kaufman testified that Kaufman had met JB in the fall of 1997. However,\nKaufman also testified that he had met JB while Kaufman was living in Austintown,\nbefore he had the house on Berkshire Drive in Youngstown, which occurred in April\n1996. Although the defense testimony severely undermines JB's credibility regarding\nhis descriptions of Kaufman's abuse from 1993 to 1995, Kaufman's own testimony\ncould support the contention that Kaufman knew JB during all of the dates between\n1995 and 1998 in the indictment.\n      {¶ 80} Thus, although Kaufman claims that the defense testimony that JB met\n\nKaufman in 1997 proved that the counts in October 1995 to 1996 were factually\nimpossible, the testimony offered by both sides was incomplete, inconsistent, and\nvague. The matter comes down to a question of overall credibility, which the jury\napparently resolved in favor of JB.\n      {¶ 81} Kaufman further points to inconsistencies in JB's testimony to argue that\n\f                                                                                   - 25 -\n\n\nthe remainder of the convictions against Kaufman involving JB, were against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Kaufman asserts that JB's claims that most of the\nmolestation occurred during or after getting out of the shower at the house on\nBerkshire were impossible because the shower did not work. Kaufman's Exhibit 14, an\ninspection report on the Berkshire house, stated that there was one bathroom in the\nhouse, and that \"Shower head is damaged. Shower head replacement is recommended.\nNo water pressure to shower. (Repairs needed.)\" Tracey and Kaufman both testified\nthat the shower did not work and was never fixed.\n      {¶ 82} However, given that there was only one bathroom in Kaufman's house on\n\nBerkshire, it does not necessarily follow that JB's claims were factually impossible.\nAlthough Kaufman offered testimony that contradicted JB's testimony, the defense did\nnot unequivocally impeach JB's testimony regarding abuse that occurred in 1995 to\n1996 or abuse that occurred in the bathroom of Kaufman's house.\n      {¶ 83} Kaufman was able to strongly call into question the accuracy or\n\nbelievability of JB's testimony as compared to KC's testimony. But JB otherwise gave\ndetailed testimony about all of the events pertinent to the case, and provided consistent\ntestimony as to the facts that satisfied the elements of the offenses charged against\nKaufman. Moreover, a defendant \"is not entitled to reversal on manifest weight\ngrounds merely because inconsistent evidence was offered at trial, 'as \"[t]he trier of\nfact is free to believe or disbelieve any or all of the testimony presented.'\" State v.\nFavor, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-215, 2008-Ohio-5371, at ¶10. The jury was permitted to\nbelieve or disbelieve any of the testimony presented, and we still must give deference\nto the jury's determination of the credibility of the witnesses. Kaufman has not\ndemonstrated that JB's testimony was so inconsistent that no reasonable jury could\nhave believed him. A jury could have found JB to be the more credible witness\n\f                                                                                     - 26 -\n\n\nwithout having lost its way.\n      {¶ 84} Although the issue is close given that the overall credibility of JB was\n\nextremely questionable, this is not one of the exceptional cases in which the evidence\nweighs heavily against the defendant's convictions, warranting reversal. Therefore,\nKaufman's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and his\nthird assignment of error is meritless.\n  Limitation of Cross-Examination in Violation of the Confrontation Clause\n      {¶ 85} In his second of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 86} \"The Trial Court Erred in Limiting the Scope of Cross Examination\n\nThereby Depriving Appellant of His Constitutional Right Of Confrontation and Cross\nExamination in Violation of U.S. Const. Amend V, VI, XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I\n§10 &16.\"\n      {¶ 87} Kaufman asserts that the trial court violated his right to confront witnesses\n\nby not allowing Kaufman to cross-examine JB regarding his juvenile adjudication for\nthe molestation of his step-brother, RT. The state counters that the elicitation of such\ntestimony was barred by Evid.R. 609(D), R.C. 2151.357(H), and R.C. 2907.02(D).\n      {¶ 88} A trial court enjoys broad discretion regarding the admissibility of\n\nevidence.

Counsel asked JB to specify, to\nwhich JB responded, \"Soon after I had moved in with my father, I was no longer\nallowed to come over, nor was I permitted to call my mother.\" Counsel continued:\n      {¶ 91} \"Q: What you were complaining about is that you were not able to see\n\nyour stepbrother [RT]; is that right?\n      {¶ 92} \"A: And my mother.\n\n      {¶ 93} \"Q: And you're attributing that to Michael Kaufman; is that right?\n\f                                                                                  - 28 -\n\n\n      {¶ 94} \"A: Yes.\"\n\n      {¶ 95} Counsel then had a side bar and asked to bring in extrinsic evidence of\n\nJB's juvenile adjudication for the molestation of RT, in order to impeach his testimony.\nCounsel intended to show that JB was removed from his mother and Kaufman's house\ndue to the adjudication. The state asserted that JB did not make claims as to why he\nhad to move out of the home, and moreover, it was Tracey's decision to kick JB out of\nthe house, not any order from the juvenile court. Additionally, the state noted that\nallowing the evidence would open the door for the state to introduce testimony\nregarding Kaufman's alleged sexual abuse of RT, whose testimony had previously been\nbarred as \"other acts\" evidence. The trial court decided that the matter was collateral\nand did not allow Kaufman to bring in extrinsic evidence of the adjudication. Upon\nfurther questioning, counsel asked JB why his mother and Kaufman wanted him out of\nthe house, and JB responded that he did not know why. Counsel renewed his motion,\nand the trial court stated that Kaufman was stuck with the answer he received.\n      {¶ 96} The question of exactly why JB hated Kaufman or what events led to JB\n\nbeing kicked out of his mother’s and Kaufman's home are issues collateral to the case.\nThe admission of evidence that JB had been adjudicated for the molestation of his\nyounger brother would not help to prove or disprove any of the elements of any\ncharges against Kaufman. It would have served only to impeach JB's credibility.\nBecause the evidence served only to impeach JB and did not have any probative value\nregarding a material issue in the case, the evidence was inadmissible. The trial court's\ndecision to bar such cross-examination was therefore not in error, let alone an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n      {¶ 97} Additionally, although the topic of JB's adjudication was raised during\n\npretrial discussions, Kaufman did not request a hearing or otherwise move the court to\n\f                                                                                   - 29 -\n\n\nconsider the admissibility of such evidence three or more days before trial as dictated\nby the rape-shield statute. R.C. 2907.02(E). Because Kaufman failed to give the\nstatutorily required notice and request for hearing, he has waived the issue.\n      {¶ 98} Finally, even if JB's adjudication had not involved evidence of JB's prior\n\nsexual activity, the evidence nonetheless would have been barred by Evid.R. 609(D),\nwhich provides that evidence of a juvenile adjudication is not admissible for\nimpeachment except as provided by statute. In his argument on appeal, Kaufman has\nnot provided any statutory justification for the introduction of JB's adjudication, aside\nfrom R.C. 2151.357(H), which explicitly states that adjudication cannot be used for the\npurpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness. As discussed above, proof that JB\nhad been adjudicated at age 13 for molesting RT did not go to a material issue to\nKaufman's case, and thus the attempted use was only for the purpose of impeaching\nJB's credibility. Again, the decision to prohibit the introduction of JB's juvenile\nadjudication was not error. Accordingly, Kaufman's second assignment of error is\nmeritless.\n                            Improper Jury Instructions\n      {¶ 99} In his fifth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 100} \"Appellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties\n\nSecured by the United States Constitution Amend.

Kaufman simply contends that the Eskridge portion of the instruction as a\nwhole should not have been included because of his insufficient-evidence claim.\nPursuant to our analysis in Kaufman's fourth assignment of error, the state presented\nsufficient evidence that Kaufman was in a position of authority over the victims.\nMoreover, the language of the instructions indicates that the trial court did not tell the\njury that they must find Kaufman to have been in a position of authority over the\nvictims. Instead, the trial court explained that a finding of an authoritative relationship\nwas a condition precedent for the use of the relaxed \"psychological force\" standard.\nThe jury was free to use either force definition provided, depending on their findings\nregarding the relationship between Kaufman and the victims.\n      {¶ 111} There was sufficient evidence for the trial court to present the question\n\nof Kaufman's position of authority over the victims and thus the Eskridge definition of\nforce.

However, in Butcher, the\nwitness’s testimony was inadmissible because it was a violation of the rules against\nhearsay. Id. at ¶66. The trial court in Butcher permitted the witness's testimony of the\nvictim's statements through the medical hearsay exception. Id. at ¶52. The appellate\ncourt found that the context of the medical interview was to collect evidence, not to\ndiagnose, and there had been no voir dire of the victims. Id. at ¶66-71. Because that\nwitness was a manufactured witness for the state, the hearsay testimony was not\ninherently reliable under the medical hearsay exception. In the case at hand, the trial\ncourt was not concerned with the inherent reliability of McPherson's hearsay\nstatements because McPherson offered no hearsay testimony. As for Kaufman's\ncontention that McPherson merely acted to bolster the credibility of the victims, it is\nwell established that expert testimony that bolsters a victim's credibility is permissible.\nState v.

Such a\ndichotomy does not exist under the rules of evidence applicable to this case,\nEvid.R.702 and 703. An expert witness's first-hand testimony, like any other witness's\nfirst-hand testimony, can be believed or disbelieved by the finder of fact and there is no\nrequirement that all experts only provide \"inherently reliable\" testimony. Kaufman's\nfirst argument is therefore not well taken.\n      {¶ 126} As his second argument, Kaufman contends that McPherson's testimony\n\f                                                                                  - 35 -\n\n\nwas so general that it did not make the existence of any material fact in the case more\nor less probable and was thus inadmissible pursuant to Evid.R. 401 and 402.

As Kaufman himself argued, McPherson's\ntestimony functioned to bolster the credibility of the victims, specifically the common\npatterns of disclosure of child sex-abuse victims. McPherson's testimony was therefore\nnot inadmissible due to relevancy issues. Kaufman's second argument is therefore not\nwell taken.\n      {¶ 127} As his third argument, Kaufman argues that McPherson's testimony was\n\ninadmissible under Evid.R. 702(A) because he offered no specialized knowledge\noutside the realm of the common knowledge of the jury. Kaufman primarily relies on\nState v. Roquemore (1993), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3683135\"><a href=\"/opinion/3935878/state-v-roquemore/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3683135\"><a href=\"/opinion/3935878/state-v-roquemore/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in support of his\nargument. The expert testimony in Roquemore was an opinion on whether a violent\n\"type\" of person would have committed the crime in question based on a crime-scene\nphotograph assessment and comparison with statistics on other violent crimes. Id. at\n453-454. In essence, the expert witness testified that because the crime scene was\ndisorganized, the crime was committed in a violent rage. Id. at 454. Such testimony\n\f                                                                                    - 36 -\n\n\nnot only contravened Evid.R. 702(A) because the jury was able to determine whether\nsomething violent had happened at the scene, but the testimony was also questionable\nunder Evid.R. 705 for a lack of statistical reliability, under Evid.R. 403(A) for the\nprejudicial way in which the defendant was profiled or stereotyped, and under Evid.R.\n404(A) for imputing a violent character to the defendant without the issue of the\ndefendant's character having been raised. Id. at 454-456. Such issues are not\napplicable in this case.\n         {¶ 128} Instead, it is established in Ohio law that the average fact-finder may\n\nrequire assistance in understanding the \"behavioral characteristics of minor victims of\nsexual abuse.\" State v.

Bortner, 9th Dist. No.\n02CA008189, 2003-Ohio-3508, at ¶46. The trial court in this case allowed McPherson\nto testify to help the jury better understand the behavioral characteristics of child sex-\nabuse victims that a layperson might not normally take into account, provided that\nMcPherson did not testify as to the veracity of the victims' statements. The trial court\nallowed the testimony in accordance with current Ohio case law and with Evid.R.\n702(A) and was thus not an abuse of discretion. Kaufman's third argument is not well\ntaken.\n         {¶ 129} As a fourth argument, Kaufman argues that McPherson's testimony was\n\ninadmissible pursuant to Evid.R. 703 because he had no first-hand knowledge about\nthe victims. Kaufman relies on cases in which experts testified regarding the\nconsistency of the particular victim's behavior with that generally observed in other\nvictims. Kaufman argues that those cases should not apply here, because McPherson\n\f                                                                                - 37 -\n\n\nhad no information about JB and KC. It is true that McPherson's testimony would\nhave been inadmissible had he offered specific conclusions about JB and KC without\nbeing given any information about them. However, McPherson did not provide any\nspecific conclusions about JB and KC.\n      {¶ 130} Evid.R. 703, as it applies to this case, does require that McPherson\n\ntestify only about facts that he has perceived. However, it does not require that he\ntestify on facts specific to the case. As noted above, an expert witness is allowed to\ntestify about general background information that might assist the fact-finder. Buell,\nsupra. See also, e.g., Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp.

The Rules of Evidence do not require that an\nexpert witness provide a factual link between his general testimony and the specific\nfacts of a case. As to the information imparted by McPherson, Kaufman does not\nargue that his statistics were unfounded or that he gave inaccurate information\nregarding his personal professional experience with children making allegations of\nsexual abuse. Thus, McPherson's testimony was admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 703,\nand Kaufman's fourth argument is not well taken.\n      {¶ 131} In summary, McPherson's testimony was within the permissible bounds\n\nof the Rules of Evidence. McPherson testified about characteristics of sexually abused\nchildren. He made no comparison between those generalities within his expertise and\nthe victims in question. He offered no opinion as to whether JB and KC had in fact\nbeen sexually abused, whether he believed the testimony of JB and KC, or whether JB\nand KC were credible witnesses. McPherson only provided information regarding\ncommon patterns of child-abuse victims in order to assist the jury in their assessment\n\f                                                                                     - 38 -\n\n\nof JB and KC's credibility.

During Tracey's cross-examination, the state asked the\nfollowing:\n      {¶ 137} \"Q: You understand that [JB] loves you; right?\n\n      {¶ 138} \"A: Yes.\n\n      {¶ 139} \"Q: And if he had complained to you about sexual abuse, and you didn't\n\ndo anything about it, that would make you a pretty bad mother, wouldn't it?\n      {¶ 140} \"A: Yes it would.\"\n\n      {¶ 141} During Kaufman's cross examination, the state asked the following:\n\n      {¶ 142} \"Q: And if you [committed the offenses charged], that would make you\n\na bad person, wouldn't it?\n      {¶ 143} * * *\n\n      {¶ 144} \"A: I would think so.\n\n      {¶ 145} * * *\n\n      {¶ 146} \"Q: A really sick person; right?\n\n      {¶ 147} * * *\n\n      {¶ 148} \"A: Yes.\"\n\n      {¶ 149} Kaufman contends that these two exchanges were only for the purpose\n\nof attacking the witness's character. The general scope of the questioning of Tracey\nwas appropriate, given that her direct examination included repeated testimony that JB\nhad not disclosed the abuse to her at any point. However, the form of the questions\nposed to Tracey and to Kaufman was inappropriate. The state seems to have worded\nthe questions merely to have the witnesses assent to questions with the words \"bad\nmother\" and \"sick person\" in them, even though the hypothetical nature of the\nquestions added nothing to the evidence.\n      {¶ 150} Kaufman's argument indicates that he is taking issue with these two\n\f                                                                                    - 40 -\n\n\nquestions because of the general impression that the mere utterance of the questions\nwould leave in the jury's mind. However, we cannot conclude that the jury decided\nthat Tracey was a bad mother and that Kaufman was a sick person due to the state's\nhypothetical questions which elicited obvious answers. While it would have been\npreferable for the state to have refrained from adding such superfluous questions, the\nquestions did not rise to the level of prejudicial error in the context of the entirety of\ntestimony presented at trial.

Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 OBR 317, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">883</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The state should avoid insinuations, which are not supported by\nadmissible evidence, which are used to mislead a jury. Id. at 14. In Smith, the\nprosecution stated during closing arguments that the entirety of the defense's evidence\nwas fabricated, and implied that defense counsel had committed perjury by\nintentionally manufacturing the allegedly false evidence presented. Id. The Ohio\nSupreme Court found that the prosecutor's misconduct was flagrant and overarching to\nthe point of depriving the defendant of a fair trial. Id.\n      {¶ 157} Some parallel could be drawn between Smith and this case in that the\n\nstate in this case made an unsupported inference regarding Kaufman's trial strategy in\norder to undermine his credibility. However, during the state's closing statements, the\nstate appears to be undermining Kaufman's credibility specifically regarding\nconflicting testimony regarding whether or not Donna's bathroom door could be\nlocked. The state did not make the kind of flagrant overarching comments that were at\nissue in Smith. The testimony regarding the bathroom door was pertinent to whether or\nnot KC was a credible witness, or specifically whether KC's testimony regarding one\n\f                                                                                   - 43 -\n\n\nparticular instance of abuse was credible.\n      {¶ 158} The state's insinuation was not terribly strong: Kaufman testified that he\n\nthought the state's witnesses would still be available at the time of his testimony.\nKaufman specifically argued against the state's claim that he \"conveniently\" waited\nuntil the state rested to introduce the fact that the bathroom door did not lock and\npointed out that the evidence was in fact discussed before the state rested. The jury\nfound that KC was, overall, credible despite the strong evidence that he was mistaken\nas to whether Donna's second floor bathroom could be locked. The jury's finding of\ncredibility could have been based on the other consistent and credible testimony\noffered by KC or perhaps based on the fact that the bathroom door was a relatively\nsmall and collateral piece of evidence. It is less likely that the jury would have\nacquitted Kaufman but for the state's improper but relatively weak statements. Given\nthe entirety of the evidence presented and the context of the state's statements, the\nstate's misconduct did not prejudice Kaufman so as to deprive him of a fair trial.\n      {¶ 159} In conclusion, counsel for the state did exceed the boundaries of\n\npropriety a few times during cross-examination and closing statements. However \"[i]f\nevery remark made by counsel outside of the testimony were ground for a reversal,\ncomparatively few verdicts would stand, since in the ardor of advocacy, and in the\nexcitement of trial, even the most experienced of counsel are occasionally carried away\nby this temptation.\" State v.

Kaufman first argues that the evidence from each victim would\nbe inadmissible as other-acts evidence in separate trials under Evid.R. 404(B) and the\nrape-shield statute. Kaufman states that the alleged pattern of committing sex offenses\nagainst children in a secretive manner is not evidence of a unique modus operandi, but\ninstead simply multiple offenses. The state argues that the evidence would have been\n\f                                                                                   - 46 -\n\n\nadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) because the offenses were committed with the same\nmodus operandi and showed motive, opportunity, intent, plan, knowledge, and/or\nabsence of mistake or accident.\n      {¶ 168} During the March 11, 2008 hearing on Kaufman's motion to sever and\n\nthe state's motion to admit other-acts testimony for unindicted offenses against RT,\nwhich the trial court denied, the state's position on both motions was that Kaufman's\nsimilar modus operandi with each victim justified the admission of other victims'\nevidence in all of the charged offenses. Although there was much discussion by\ncounsel regarding the motions, the trial court did not provide reasoning on the record\nas to why it specifically overruled Kaufman's motion to sever. In the written judgment\nentry, the trial court stated only that Kaufman failed to demonstrate that he would be\nprejudiced by the joinder of the offenses and quoted the language of Crim.R. 8(A) that\nthe offenses \"are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or\ntransaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or\nconstituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal\nconduct.\" Thus, although the state argued in favor of joinder only under the other-acts\ntest, the trial court did not indicate whether it had overruled Kaufman's motion for the\nsame reason.\n      {¶ 169} Looking first at the \"other acts test,\" we analyze whether evidence from\n\neach victim would have been admissible in other trials if they had been severed as\nrequested. We note that \"[t]he admissibility of other acts evidence is carefully limited\nbecause of the substantial danger that the jury will convict the defendant solely because\nit assumes that the defendant has a propensity to commit criminal acts, or deserves\npunishment regardless of whether he or she committed the crime charged in the\nindictment.\" Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 59, citing State v.

Evid.R. 404 states that \"[e]vidence of a\nperson's character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving\naction in conformity therewith on a particular occasion\" and that \"[e]vidence of other\ncrimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to\nshow action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other\npurposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\nidentity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" Evid.R. 404 notes that exceptions apply\npursuant to rape and gross sexual imposition statutes. The exception language in both\nthe rape and gross-sexual-imposition statutes, R.C. 2907.02(D) and 2907.05(E) is\nidentical and states:\n          {¶ 171} \"Evidence of specific instances of the defendant's sexual activity,\n\nopinion evidence of the defendant's sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the\ndefendant's sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves\nevidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, the defendant's past sexual\nactivity with the victim, or is admissible against the defendant under section 2945.59 of\nthe Revised Code, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is\nmaterial to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature\ndoes not outweigh its probative value.\"\n          {¶ 172} Because we are looking at the admission of sexual-activity evidence\n\nfrom two different victims that do not involve the origin of semen, pregnancy, or\ndisease, the other-acts evidence must be admissible pursuant to R.C. 2945.59, which\nstates:\n\f                                                                                   - 48 -\n\n\n      {¶ 173} \"In any criminal case in which the defendant's motive or intent, the\n\nabsence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan, or system\nin doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or\nintent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan,\nor system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are\ncontemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof\nmay show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\"\n      {¶ 174} Thus there are only a few limited circumstances under which other-acts\n\ninvolving sexual activity would be admissible in a separate case. The state's objective\nof showing that Kaufman had committed the offenses with the same pattern would\nonly fall under the \"scheme, plan, or system\" category of R.C. 2945.59. However,\nsuch \"pattern\" evidence is only relevant in a case under two scenarios:\n      {¶ 175} The first scenario exists in a case when \"the 'other acts' form part of the\n\nimmediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime\ncharged in the indictment. In such cases, it would be virtually impossible to prove that\nthe accused committed the crime charged without also introducing evidence of the\nother acts. To be admissible pursuant to this sub-category of 'scheme, plan or system'\nevidence, the 'other acts' testimony must concern events which are inextricably related\nto the alleged criminal act.\" Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d at 73.\n      {¶ 176} An example of inextricably related acts might involve overlapping time\n\nand place of the offenses against different victims, such as occurred in In re\nHollobaugh, 7th Dist.

In the case at hand, the offenses alleged occurred at temporally\ndistinct times against victims who did not know one another.

See also\nSchaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at fn. 11. As is often the case in offenses of a sexual nature,\nwhether or not the crime actually occurred is in issue and is thus not open and evident.\nHere, the identity of the offender is not disputed. Like the facts in Schaim, there is no\ndispute that if the victims were telling the truth, Kaufman was the perpetrator. See\nSchaim at 61. This indicates that witness credibility rather than identity is the material\nissue in the case. Thus the evidence from other victims should not be admitted as\nother-acts evidence under this second scenario.\n      {¶ 178} More importantly, in the same hearing on Kaufman's motion for relief\n\nfrom prejudicial joinder, the trial court denied the state's motion to admit evidence of\nother acts through the testimony of RT, the victim not included in the original\nindictment. The state had requested the admission of evidence from the additional\nvictim for the same reason: in order to demonstrate that Kaufman committed additional\n\f                                                                                    - 50 -\n\n\noffenses in the same manner against the same type of victim. The trial court noted the\nextremely prejudicial nature of other-acts evidence during that hearing and during later\ndiscussion on the matter at trial. Given the trial court's decision on a different alleged\nvictim on the same other- acts issue, the trial court could not have denied Kaufman's\nmotion for relief from prejudicial joinder on the same grounds.\n      {¶ 179} Based on the foregoing, it is clear that joinder was not possible under the\n\nother-acts test. Thus the only way joinder would have been permissible in this case\nwould have been through satisfaction of the broader joinder test.\n      {¶ 180} The joinder test only requires that the evidence of each joined offense is\n\nsimple and distinct and ensures that a jury would be capable of segregating the proof\nrequired for each offense.

The state counters that the\nevidence was simple and distinct because the testimony of each victim was separate\nand uncomplicated. The state relies primarily on State v. Bell, 7th Dist. No. 06 MA\n189, 2008-Ohio-3959, and In re Hollobaugh, 7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797,\nto support this contention.\n      {¶ 182} It is true that Hollobaugh and Bell survived the \"simple and direct\n\nevidence\" analysis on the joinder issues raised therein. However, the joinder issue in\nboth of those cases was resolved under a plain-error standard of review due to waiver.\nHere, Kaufman timely moved for relief from prejudicial joinder and renewed his\nmotion repeatedly during trial in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Additionally,\n\f                                                                                    - 51 -\n\n\nBell and Hollobaugh are both factually distinguishable.\n      {¶ 183} In Bell, the presence of DNA evidence linked the perpetrator to the\n\noffenses. Bell at ¶21-22. Due to the immediate reporting of the victims and the\npresence of DNA evidence, the fact of the crimes in Bell was open and evident, which\nindicates that the testimony otherwise may have been admissible pursuant to the\nsecond scenario of the other-acts test as described above. In Hollobaugh, this court\nrelied on the fact that the case was tried under the Juvenile Rules, and at a bench trial\nrather than to a jury, in order to conclude that the risk of prejudice from multiple\ninflammatory accusations was low. Hollobaugh at ¶34. This court also pointed out the\ninextricable nature of the victims' testimony, which indicates that the testimony\notherwise may have been admissible pursuant to the first scenario of the other-acts test.\nId. at ¶35. Thus, although the factual backgrounds of these two cases may be similar\nto the one at hand, they do not support a finding of nonprejudicial joinder in this case\ndue to additional factors at play.\n      {¶ 184} Focusing entirely on the simplicity versus complexity of evidence, this\n\ncase could be appropriate for joinder at first blush. The offenses took place during\ndifferent time periods, in different places, against different victims. Each victim gave\nclear testimony as to his allegations, and the testimony offered by one victim did not\ncontradict or overlap with the testimony of the other victim. We have no reason to\npresume that the jury confused which offenses Kaufman committed against KC and\nwhich offenses Kaufman committed against JB.\n      {¶ 185} However, complexity of information is not the only consideration in this\n\nanalysis. This inquiry at hand \"focuses on whether the trier of fact is likely to consider\n'evidence of one [offense] as corroborative of the other.'\" State v. Wiles (1991), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, quoting Dunaway v. United States (C.A.D.C.1953), 205\n\f                                                                                 - 52 -\n\n\nF.2d 23, 27. The risk of the jury erroneously using one victim's evidence to\ncorroborate the other victim's testimony is not only possible through the confusion of\nfacts, but also through mistakenly presuming that the numerous similarities between\nunrelated offenses make it more likely that the offenses occurred.\n      {¶ 186} As stated in Torres, \"[j]oinder may be prejudicial when the offenses are\n\nunrelated and the evidence as to each is very weak, but it is otherwise when the\nevidence is direct and uncomplicated and can reasonably be separated as to each\noffense.\" (Emphasis added.) Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d at 343. In Schaim, the defendant\nhad been convicted of rape and gross sexual imposition stemming from offenses\nagainst his adopted daughter and a younger daughter. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 52.\nThe Ohio Supreme Court rejected the state's argument that the evidence against Schaim\nwas simple and direct enough to avoid prejudice. After pointing out that even the\nappellate court had confused the testimony of two of the victims, the Ohio Supreme\nCourt concluded that \"[g]iven the highly inflammatory nature of the offenses, the\nsimilarities between portions of [the victims'] testimony, and the fact that joinder\nallowed the state to circumvent the prohibition on other acts testimony, we conclude\nthat the defendant was prejudiced by the consolidated trial.\" Id. at 62-63. Thus,\nprejudice can occur with offenses which are highly inflammatory in nature and involve\nsimilar victim testimony. When such prejudice was demonstrated in Schaim, the trial\ncourt \"abused its discretion in refusing to sever these counts, particularly when its\nreasons for doing so were based on the fact that committing one of these crimes shows\na propensity to commit another – an inference that a jury is forbidden to draw.\" Id. at\n63. Although Kaufman's offenses against victims JB and KC were distinct in terms of\ntime and place, the similarities between the sexual abuses committed against each\nvictim, the inflammatory nature of the offenses, and the weakness of the evidence,\n\f                                                                                     - 53 -\n\n\nespecially in regards to JB, all indicate that the risk of prejudice from joinder in this\ncase was extremely high.\n      {¶ 187} Because there is an especially high danger that the jury may cumulate\n\nthe evidence of separate offenses that are jointly tried, \"both the trial court and counsel\nmust conduct such a trial with 'vigilant precision in speech and action far beyond that\nrequired in the ordinary trial.'\" State v. Garrett, 12th Dist. No. CA2008-08-075, 2009-\nOhio-5442, at ¶49, quoting Drew v. United States (C.A.D.C.1964), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"264122\"><a href=\"/opinion/264122/nathan-l-drew-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94.\n      {¶ 188} Such \"precision in speech and action\" was not conducted here and is\n\nmost clearly exemplified by the state's following remarks during closing arguments:\n\"There are no eyewitnesses to these types of crimes. They happen in private with the\ndefendant or any other defendant, and the victim. But what you have here is even\nstronger than if there were eyewitnesses, because you have two independent victims,\nseparate and apart. * * * That is stronger than an eyewitness. That is independent\ncorroboration. They both said what happened to them, and they corroborate each\nother's stories, because what happened to one is essentially the mirror image of what\nhappened to the other.\" (Emphasis added). This statement elucidates the risk of\nprejudice from erroneously considering the separate evidence of JB and KC\ncumulatively, especially in light of the weakness of the evidence regarding victim JB.\nAs in Schaim, we find that Kaufman was prejudiced by the joinder of multiple victims,\ngiven the inflammatory nature of the offenses, the similar victim testimony, and the\nfact that the state was able to use the \"joinder test\" as a back door to present an \"other\nacts\" and propensity argument.\n      {¶ 189} Our conclusion is not meant to imply that any offenses of a sexual\n\nnature must be severed for fear that a fact-finder will erroneously use the evidence of\none crime to corroborate the other. A good example of when multiple sexual offenses\n\f                                                                                     - 54 -\n\n\ndo not call for severance is in this court's recent decision in State v. Dew, 7th Dist. No.\n08 MA 62, 2009-Ohio-6537. In Dew, the defendant requested separate trials for two\ngroups of victims, one group of victims who were minors at the time of the offenses\nand one group of victims who were adults. Id. at ¶6, 89. The circumstances of Dew's\noffenses against the two groups of victims, as well as his relationships with the two\ngroups of victims, were rather different: Dew had been a gymnastics coach for the\nminors, had a great amount of control over their lives, was an authority figure and even\na father figure to the victims, and groomed the victims over a number of years. Id. at\n¶5-22.     As for the adult victims, they received unnecessary and inappropriate\nchiropractic treatments by Dew. Id. at ¶31-40. There was no indication in Dew that\neach victim's allegation was used in order to argue that the victims' claims\nindependently corroborated one another and, by implication, made it more likely that\nthe offenses occurred. There was further indication that the jury was in fact able to\nsegregate the evidence regarding each victim, as the jury acquitted Dew on a number\nof counts. Id. at ¶ 95, citing State v. Schiebel (1990), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">54</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n         {¶ 190} When keeping in mind the policies promoted by the rape-shield statute,\n\nwhich must be equally applied to protect both the victims and the defendants, the\ntendency for a jury to use one victim's testimony to corroborate the other's is too likely\ngiven the particular facts presented at Kaufman's trial. Although it may not have been\nan abuse of discretion for the trial court to initially deny Kaufman's motion for relief\nfrom prejudicial joinder, the trial court abused its discretion by summarily denying the\nmotion when Kaufman renewed his motion both after the state's case in chief and at the\nclose of trial. Accordingly, Kaufman's first assignment of error is meritorious.\n                          Remaining Assignments of Error\n\f                                                                                 - 55 -\n\n\n      {¶ 191} In his seventh, eighth and ninth assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:\n\n      {¶ 192} \"Appellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties\n\nSecured by the United States Constitution Amend. V & XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I, §§\n10 and 16 When the Trial Court Provided assistance to the State to Insure All Evidence\nof all Elements had been Presented.\"\n      {¶ 193} \"The Trial Court Abused its Discretion in Denying a Request for\n\nContinuance When Defense Counsel CanNot Provide Effective Assistance of Counsel\nand Additional time is Needed to Prepare.\"\n      {¶ 194} \"Appellant's Convictions and Sentences Are in Violation of the State\n\nand Federal Constitutions Because Appellant Was Denied the Effective Assistance of\nCounsel. U.S. CONST., amend. VI and XIV; OHIO CONST., art. I, §§1, 10 and 16.\"\n      {¶ 195} Given our disposition of Kaufman's first assignment of error, Kaufman's\n\nseventh, eighth, and ninth assignments of error are moot.\n      {¶ 196} In conclusion, Kaufman's assertions regarding sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, manifest weight of the evidence, cross-examination, jury instructions, expert\ntestimony, and prosecutorial misconduct are meritless. However, Kaufman's assertion\nof prejudicial joinder is well taken and his first assignment of error is meritorious.\nKaufman's remaining assignments of error are rendered moot due to the resolution of\nthe first assignment of error. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed\nand remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n                                                     Judgment accordingly.\n      DONOFRIO, J., concurs.\n      VUKOVICH, P.J., dissents.\n                               __________________\n\f                                                                                      - 56 -\n\n\n       VUKOVICH, Presiding Judge, dissenting:\n\n       {¶ 197} I dissent from the decision to reverse appellant’s conviction merely\n\nbecause sexual offenses committed against two child-victims were joined in one trial. I\nbelieve that the defendant has not met his burden of establishing prejudice under the\n“joinder test.” As a result, the “other acts” test is irrelevant. State v. Johnson (2000),\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109.\n       {¶ 198} As the majority points out, joinder is favored in the law. The joinder\n\ntest is “less stringent” than the “stricter” other-acts test. Id. at 109; State v. LeMar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2002-Ohio-2128, ¶50. Thus, policy reasons for the other-acts test\nshould not seep into the application of the joinder test.\n       {¶ 199} A claim of prejudice can be negated if the evidence of each joined\n\noffense is simple and direct. LeMar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at ¶50, 52. Thus, where the\nproof of the joined offenses was separate and distinct and the jury was not likely to be\nconfused as to which evidence proved which offense, a trial court does not abuse its\ndiscretion in refusing to sever the offenses. State v. Coley (2001), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n260.\n       {¶ 200} As for references to the strength of the evidence and the relatedness of\n\nthe offenses, I believe the majority misinterprets the following test:\n       {¶ 201} “Joinder may be prejudicial when the offenses are unrelated and the\n\nevidence as to each is very weak, but it is otherwise when the evidence is direct and\nuncomplicated and can reasonably be separated as to each offense.” State v. Torres\n(1981), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343-344.\n       {¶ 202} This statement clearly means that if the second part of this sentence is\n\nsatisfied, there is no prejudice regardless of the first part. Here, the evidence was\n\f                                                                                     - 57 -\n\n\ndirect and uncomplicated and could be reasonably and readily separated as to each\noffense. See State v. Skatzes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2004-Ohio-6391, ¶34. As the\nmajority acknowledges, the offenses against each of the two victims were separated in\ntime and place. Each victim testified as to their various allegations against appellant.\nThere was no apparent confusion as to which acts were committed against which\nvictim. The evidence was simple.\n      {¶ 203} In any event, I would not characterize the evidence as “very weak.” See\n\nTorres, 66 Ohio St.2d at 343-344. The trial court, whose discretion is being evaluated\nhere, heard and viewed the witnesses as they testified; this court did not. Furthermore,\nthe offenses are not unrelated as they involved the sexual abuse of two young male\nchildren by a person in a position of authority.\n      {¶ 204} Nor do I agree that the “inflammatory” nature of the allegations require\n\nseverance. In Johnson, the Supreme Court had no problem with joinder of a\nkidnapping/robbery victim with a death-penalty aggravated murder that occurred two\nmonths apart, focusing on the simplicity and directness of the evidence and the fact\nthat it was unlikely that the jury confused the evidence proving the separate charges.\nJohnson, 88 Ohio St.3d at 110. Cf. State v. Schaim (1992), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63\n(finding that jury was not capable of segregating very similar evidence because even\nthe three appellate judges could not keep the facts of each victim straight). Finally, this\ncourt recently upheld joinder where minor gymnast victims and adult chiropractic\nvictims were joined for one trial where all allegations were sexual in nature. State v.\nDew, 7th Dist. No. 08MA62, 2009-Ohio-6537, ¶95-96.\n      {¶ 205} Accordingly, I would overrule appellant’s first assignment of error\n\ndealing with joinder. I would then overrule all other assignments of error (including\nnumbers seven through nine, which the majority found to be moot) and uphold\n\f                           - 58 -\n\n\nappellant’s convictions.\n\f</pre>",
