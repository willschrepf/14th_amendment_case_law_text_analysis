On our review, we hold the Iowa marriage statute\nviolates the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution. Therefore, we\n\naffirm the decision of the district court.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n       This lawsuit is a civil rights action by twelve individuals who reside in\n\nsix communities across Iowa.              Like most Iowans, they are responsible,\n\ncaring, and productive individuals.            They maintain important jobs, or are\n\nretired, and are contributing, benevolent members of their communities.\n\nThey include a nurse, business manager, insurance analyst, bank agent,\n\nstay-at-home parent, church organist and piano teacher, museum director,\n\nfederal employee, social worker, teacher, and two retired teachers.                      Like\n\nmany Iowans, some have children and others hope to have children. Some\n\nare foster parents. Like all Iowans, they prize their liberties and live within\n\nthe borders of this state with the expectation that their rights will be\n\nmaintained and protected—a belief embraced by our state motto.1\n       Despite the commonality shared with other Iowans, the twelve\n\nplaintiffs are different from most in one way.                   They are sexually and\n\nromantically attracted to members of their own sex.                  The twelve plaintiffs\n\ncomprise six same-sex couples who live in committed relationships. Each\n\nmaintains a hope of getting married one day, an aspiration shared by many\n\nthroughout Iowa.\n\n\n\n       1The   state motto of Iowa is: “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.”\nIt is inscribed on the Great Seal of Iowa and on our state flag. See Iowa Code §§ 1A.1, 1B.1\n(2009).\n\f                                            8\n\n\n       Unlike opposite-sex couples in Iowa, same-sex couples are not\n\npermitted to marry in Iowa.          The Iowa legislature amended the marriage\n\nstatute in 1998 to define marriage as a union between only a man and a\n\nwoman.2 Despite this law, the six same-sex couples in this litigation asked\n\nthe Polk County Recorder to issue marriage licenses to them. The recorder,\n\nfollowing the law, refused to issue the licenses, and the six couples have\n\nbeen unable to be married in this state. Except for the statutory restriction\n\nthat defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, the twelve\n\nplaintiffs met the legal requirements to marry in Iowa.\n\n       As other Iowans have done in the past when faced with the\n\nenforcement of a law that prohibits them from engaging in an activity or\n\nachieving a status enjoyed by other Iowans, the twelve plaintiffs turned to\n\nthe courts to challenge the statute.            They seek to declare the marriage\n\nstatute unconstitutional so they can obtain the array of benefits of marriage\n\nenjoyed by heterosexual couples, protect themselves and their children, and\n\ndemonstrate to one another and to society their mutual commitment.\n\n       In turning to the courts, the twelve plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the\n\nPolk County District Court. They claimed the statutory same-sex marriage\n\nban violates certain liberty and equality rights under the Iowa Constitution.\n\nThe individual rights claimed by plaintiffs to be adversely affected (by the\n\naction of the legislative branch in enacting the same-sex marriage ban and\n\nthe action of the government officials of the executive branch in enforcing the\n\nban) included the fundamental right to marry, as well as rights to privacy\n\nand familial association. Additionally, plaintiffs claimed the legislative and\n\n\n\n        2Iowa Code section 595.2(1) provides “[o]nly a marriage between a male and a female\n\nis valid.” All statutory references are to the 2009 Code of Iowa. While some statutes\nreferenced here have been amended since this lawsuit originated, none of the amendments\ndictate the outcome of this case.\n\f                                       9\n\n\nthe executive actions unconstitutionally discriminated against them on\n\nseveral bases, including sexual orientation.\n\n      The case was presented to the district court by means of a summary\n\njudgment motion. The record was developed through witness affidavits and\n\ndepositions. This record included an explanation by some of the plaintiffs of\n\nthe disadvantages and fears they face each day due to the inability to obtain\n\na civil marriage in Iowa. These disadvantages and problems include the legal\n\ninability to make many life and death decisions affecting their partner,\n\nincluding decisions related to health care, burial arrangements, autopsy,\n\nand disposition of remains following death.      Various plaintiffs told of the\n\ninability to share in their partners’ state-provided health insurance, public-\n\nemployee pension benefits, and many private-employer-provided benefits\n\nand protections. They also explained how several tax benefits are denied.\n\nAdoption proceedings are also more cumbersome and expensive for\n\nunmarried partners. Other obstacles presented by the inability to enter into\n\na civil marriage include numerous nongovernmental benefits of marriage\n\nthat are so common in daily life they often go unnoticed, such as something\n\nso simple as spousal health club memberships. Yet, perhaps the ultimate\n\ndisadvantage expressed in the testimony of the plaintiffs is the inability to\n\nobtain for themselves and for their children the personal and public\n\naffirmation that accompanies marriage.\n\n      The parties also explored the reasons for defining marriage in a way\n\nthat denies these benefits to same-sex couples.        The County offered five\n\nprimary interests of society in support of the legislature’s exclusive definition\n\nof marriage. The first three interests are broadly related to the advancement\n\nof child rearing.     Specifically, the objectives centered on promoting\n\nprocreation, promoting child rearing by a mother and a father within a\n\f                                      10\n\n\nmarriage, and promoting stability in an opposite-sex relationship to raise\n\nand nurture children. The fourth interest raised by the County addressed\n\nthe conservation of state resources, while the final reason concerned the\n\ngovernmental interest in promoting the concept and integrity of the\n\ntraditional notion of marriage.\n\n      Much of the testimony presented by the County was in the form of\n\nopinions by various individuals that same-sex marriage would harm the\n\ninstitution of marriage and also harm children raised in same-sex marriages.\n\nTwo college professors testified that a heterosexual marriage is, overall, the\n\noptimal forum in which to raise children. A retired pediatrician challenged\n\nthe accuracy of some of the medical research that concludes there is no\n\nsignificant difference between children raised by same-sex couples and\n\nopposite-sex couples. A clinical psychologist testified sexual orientation is\n\nnot as defined and stable as race and gender and can change over time. He\n\nacknowledged, however, it is difficult to change a person’s sexual orientation,\n\nand efforts to do so can be harmful to the person.\n\n      The plaintiffs produced evidence to demonstrate sexual orientation\n\nand gender have no effect on children raised by same-sex couples, and\n\nsame-sex couples can raise children as well as opposite-sex couples. They\n\nalso submitted evidence to show that most scientific research has repudiated\n\nthe commonly assumed notion that children need opposite-sex parents or\n\nbiological parents to grow into well-adjusted adults.           Many leading\n\norganizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American\n\nPsychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National\n\nAssociation of Social Workers, and the Child Welfare League of America,\n\nweighed the available research and supported the conclusion that gay and\n\nlesbian parents are as effective as heterosexual parents in raising children.\n\f                                           11\n\n\nFor example, the official policy of the American Psychological Association\n\ndeclares, “There is no scientific evidence that parenting effectiveness is\n\nrelated to parental sexual orientation: Lesbian and gay parents are as likely\n\nas heterosexual parents to provide supportive and healthy environments for\n\nchildren.”3    Almost every professional group that has studied the issue\n\nindicates children are not harmed when raised by same-sex couples, but to\n\nthe contrary, benefit from them. In Iowa, agencies that license foster parents\n\nhave found same-sex couples to be good and acceptable parents.                       It is\n\nestimated that more than 5800 same-sex couples live throughout Iowa, and\n\nover one-third of these couples are raising children.\n\n       The district court concluded the statute was unconstitutional under\n\nthe due process and equal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution and\n\ngranted summary judgment to the plaintiffs. It initially ordered the county\n\nrecorder to begin processing marriage licenses for same-sex couples, but\n\nstayed the order during the pendency of an appeal.\n\n       II. Standard of Review.\n\n       Summary judgment is appropriate only when “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.” Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.981(3). “An issue of fact is\n\n‘material’ only when the dispute is over facts that might affect the outcome of\n\nthe suit, given the applicable governing law.”             Junkins v. Branstad, 421\n\nN.W.2d 130, 132 (Iowa 1988).            The party requesting summary judgment\n\n\n       3This statement is the official policy of the American Psychological Association\n\nregarding sexual orientation, parents, and children. See Am. Psychological Ass’n Council of\nRepresentatives, Am.

We review the legal issues necessary for resolution of the\n\nconstitutional claims presented within the context of the summary judgment\n\nproceeding de novo.     Kistler v. City of Perry, 719 N.W.2d 804, 805 (Iowa\n\n2006).\n\n      III. Constitutional Separation of Powers.\n\n      We approach the resolution of this case with a keen and respectful\n\nunderstanding of our Iowa Constitution and the vital roles of the three\n\nbranches of government, as well as the role of the people. It is important for\n\nthese roles to be identified and expressed from time to time when individuals\n\nseek recognition of rights, if only to serve as a reminder of the process of\n\ngoverning that has served us so well as a state for over 150 years.\n\n      The Iowa Constitution is the cornerstone of governing in Iowa. Like\n\nthe United States Constitution, the Iowa Constitution creates a remarkable\n\nblueprint for government. It establishes three separate, but equal, branches\n\nof government and delineates the limited roles and powers of each branch.\n\nSee Iowa Const. art. III, § 1 (“The powers of the government of Iowa shall be\n\ndivided into three separate departments—the legislative, the executive, and\n\nthe judicial:   and no person charged with the exercise of powers properly\n\nbelonging to one of these departments shall exercise any function\n\nappertaining to either of the others, except in cases hereinafter expressly\n\ndirected or permitted.”). Among other basic principles essential to our form\n\nof government, the constitution defines certain individual rights upon which\n\nthe government may not infringe. See Iowa Const. art. I (“Bill of Rights”).\n\nEqual protection of the law is one of the guaranteed rights. See Iowa Const.\n\nart. I, § 6.    All these rights and principles are declared and undeniably\n\f                                      13\n\n\naccepted as the supreme law of this state, against which no contrary law can\n\nstand. See Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1 (“This constitution shall be the supreme\n\nlaw of the state, and any law inconsistent therewith, shall be void.”).\n\n      This case, as with most other civil rights actions before it, implicates\n\nthese broad constitutional principles of governing.        The legislature, in\n\ncarrying out its constitutional role to make public policy decisions, enacted a\n\nlaw that effectively excludes gay and lesbian people from the institution of\n\ncivil marriage. The executive branch of government, in carrying out its role\n\nto execute the law, enforced this statute through a county official who\n\nrefused to issue marriage licenses to six same-sex couples. These Iowans,\n\nbelieving that the law is inconsistent with certain constitutional mandates,\n\nexercised their constitutional right to petition the courts for redress of their\n\ngrievance.   This court, consistent with its role to interpret the law and\n\nresolve disputes, now has the responsibility to determine if the law enacted\n\nby the legislative branch and enforced by the executive branch violates the\n\nIowa Constitution.\n\n      A statute inconsistent with the Iowa Constitution must be declared\n\nvoid, even though it may be supported by strong and deep-seated traditional\n\nbeliefs and popular opinion.    Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1 (providing any law\n\ninconsistent with the constitution is void). As Chief Justice John Marshall\n\nwrote over two centuries ago, “It is a proposition too plain to be contested,\n\nthat the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it . . . .”\n\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60, 73 (1803).\n\n      It is also well established that courts must, under all circumstances,\n\nprotect the supremacy of the constitution as a means of protecting our\n\nrepublican form of government and our freedoms.           As was observed by\n\nJustice Robert H. Jackson decades ago in reference to the United States\n\f                                           14\n\n\nConstitution, the very purpose of limiting the power of the elected branches\n\nof government by constitutional provisions like the Equal Protection Clause\n\nis “to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy,\n\nto place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish\n\nthem as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” W. Va. State Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638, 63 S. Ct. 1178, 1185, 87 L. Ed. 1628,\n\n1638 (1943).\n\n      The same principle applies to the provisions of the Iowa Constitution\n\nthat limit government power. The idea that courts, free from the political\n\ninfluences in the other two branches of government, are better suited to\n\nprotect individual rights was recognized at the time our Iowa Constitution\n\nwas formed. See Koehler v. Hill, 60 Iowa 543, 667, 15 N.W. 609, 640–41\n\n(1883) (Beck, J., dissenting) (“Judges ought not to be partisans, and be\n\ninfluenced by partisan control. Their duty is to interpret and apply the law,\n\nto the end that the liberty, and the rights and property, of the people may be\n\nsecured.”); 1 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention; of the State of\n\nIowa 453 (W. Blair Lord rep.) (Davenport, Luse, Lane & Co. 1857) (containing\n\nexpression of one delegate’s desire “to have one department of our State\n\ngovernment in regard to which we can say, there is no political taint or bias,\n\nthere is no partisan complexion to it; it is of such a character that when we\n\ngo before it to have our dearest rights decided, we may rest assured that they\n\nwill be decided upon principles of law and equity, and not upon political or\n\nparty principles”).\n\n      In fulfilling this mandate under the Iowa Constitution, we look to the\n\npast and to precedent. We look backwards, not because citizens’ rights are\n\nconstrained    to     those   previously   recognized,   but   because   historical\n\f                                       15\n\n\nconstitutional principles provide the framework to define our future as we\n\nconfront the challenges of today.\n\n      Our responsibility, however, is to protect constitutional rights of\n\nindividuals from legislative enactments that have denied those rights, even\n\nwhen the rights have not yet been broadly accepted, were at one time\n\nunimagined, or challenge a deeply ingrained practice or law viewed to be\n\nimpervious to the passage of time.      The framers of the Iowa Constitution\n\nknew, as did the drafters of the United States Constitution, that “times can\n\nblind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once\n\nthought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,” and as our\n\nconstitution “endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles\n\nin their own search for greater freedom” and equality.         See Lawrence v.\n\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 578–79, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 2484, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508, 526\n\n(2003) (acknowledging intent of framers of Federal Constitution that\n\nConstitution endure and be interpreted by future generations); Callender v.\n\nSkiles, 591 N.W.2d 182, 190 (Iowa 1999) (“Our constitution is not merely\n\ntied to tradition, but recognizes the changing nature of society.”).\n\n      When individuals invoke the Iowa Constitution’s guarantees of\n\nfreedom and equality, courts are bound to interpret those guarantees. In\n\ncarrying out this fundamental and vital role, “we must never forget that it is\n\na constitution we are expounding.” M’Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.)\n\n316, 407, 4 L. Ed. 579, 602 (1819). It speaks with principle, as we, in turn,\n\nmust also. See State v. Wheeler, 34 P.3d 799, 807 (Wash. 2001) (Sanders,\n\nJ., dissenting).\n\n      Finally, it should be recognized that the constitution belongs to the\n\npeople, not the government or even the judicial branch of government. See\n\nIowa Const. art. I, § 2 (“All political power is inherent in the people.\n\f                                      16\n\n\nGovernment is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the\n\npeople, and they have the right, at all times, to alter or reform the same,\n\nwhenever the public good may require it.”).      While the constitution is the\n\nsupreme law and cannot be altered by the enactment of an ordinary statute,\n\nthe power of the constitution flows from the people, and the people of Iowa\n\nretain the ultimate power to shape it over time.        See Iowa Const. art. X\n\n(“Amendments to the Constitution”).\n\n      IV. Equal Protection.\n\n      A. Background Principles.       The primary constitutional principle at\n\nthe heart of this case is the doctrine of equal protection.     The concept of\n\nequal protection is deeply rooted in our national and state history, but that\n\nhistory reveals this concept is often expressed far more easily than it is\n\npracticed. For sure, our nation has struggled to achieve a broad national\n\nconsensus on equal protection of the laws when it has been forced to apply\n\nthat principle to some of the institutions, traditions, and norms woven into\n\nthe fabric of our society.    This observation is important today because it\n\nreveals equal protection can only be defined by the standards of each\n\ngeneration. See Cass R. Sunstein, Sexual Orientation and the Constitution: A\n\nNote on the Relationship Between Due Process and Equal Protection, 55\n\nU. Chi. L. Rev. 1161, 1163 (1988) (“[T]he Equal Protection Clause looks\n\nforward, serving to invalidate practices that were widespread at the time of\n\nits ratification and that were expected to endure.”).\n\n      The process of defining equal protection, as shown by our history as\n\ncaptured and told in court decisions, begins by classifying people into\n\ngroups.    A classification persists until a new understanding of equal\n\nprotection is achieved.      The point in time when the standard of equal\n\nprotection finally takes a new form is a product of the conviction of one, or\n\f                                      17\n\n\nmany, individuals that a particular grouping results in inequality and the\n\nability of the judicial system to perform its constitutional role free from the\n\ninfluences that tend to make society’s understanding of equal protection\n\nresistant to change. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes poignantly said, “It is\n\nrevolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid\n\ndown in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon\n\nwhich it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply\n\npersists from blind imitation of the past.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, Justice,\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, The Path of the Law, address\n\ndedicating new hall at Boston University School of Law (January 8, 1897), in\n\n10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897). This concept is evident in our past cases.\n\n      In the first reported case of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Iowa,\n\nIn re Ralph, 1 Morris 1 (Iowa 1839), we refused to treat a human being as\n\nproperty to enforce a contract for slavery and held our laws must extend\n\nequal protection to persons of all races and conditions. 1 Morris at 9. This\n\ndecision was seventeen years before the United States Supreme Court\n\ninfamously decided Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 15 L. Ed.\n\n691 (1856), which upheld the rights of a slave owner to treat a person as\n\nproperty. Similarly, in Clark v. Board of Directors, 24 Iowa 266 (1868), and\n\nCoger v. North West. Union Packet Co., 37 Iowa 145 (1873), we struck blows\n\nto the concept of segregation long before the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98\n\nL. Ed. 873 (1954).   Iowa was also the first state in the nation to admit a\n\nwoman to the practice of law, doing so in 1869. Admission of Women to the\n\nBar, 1 Chicago Law Times 76, 76 (1887).        Her admission occurred three\n\nyears before the United States Supreme Court affirmed the State of Illinois’\n\ndecision to deny women admission to the practice of law, see Bradwell v.\n\f                                             18\n\n\nIllinois, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 130, 139, 21 L. Ed. 442, 445 (1873), and twenty-\n\nfive years before the United States Supreme Court affirmed the refusal of the\n\nCommonwealth of Virginia to admit women into the practice of law, see\n\nEx parte Lockwood, 154 U.S. 116, 118, 14 S. Ct. 1082, 1083, 38 L. Ed. 929,\n\n930 (1894). In each of those instances, our state approached a fork in the\n\nroad toward fulfillment of our constitution’s ideals and reaffirmed the\n\n“absolute equality of all” persons before the law as “the very foundation\n\nprinciple of our government.”4 See Coger, 37 Iowa at 153.\n\n       So, today, this court again faces an important issue that hinges on our\n\ndefinition of equal protection.           This issue comes to us with the same\n\nimportance as our landmark cases of the past.                    The same-sex-marriage\n\ndebate waged in this case is part of a strong national dialogue5 centered on a\n\nfundamental, deep-seated, traditional institution that has excluded, by state\n\naction, a particular class of Iowans. This class of people asks a simple and\n\ndirect question: How can a state premised on the constitutional principle of\n\nequal protection justify exclusion of a class of Iowans from civil marriage?\n\n       4The  cases we have cited are not meant to imply this court has been at the forefront\nin recognizing civil rights in all areas and at all times. See, e.g., In re Carragher, 149 Iowa\n225, 229–30, 128 N.W. 352, 354 (1910) (upholding a law that effectively denied women\npharmacists the right to sell alcohol, stating “discrimination between the sexes is neither\narbitrary nor capricious, and the fact that in many instances individuals of one sex are in\ngeneral better fitted than those of the other sex for a given occupation or business is one of\nsuch common knowledge and observation that the Legislature may properly recognize it in\nenacting regulations therefor”). These cases do, however, reflect this court has, for the most\npart, been at the forefront in recognizing individuals’ civil rights. The path we have taken as\na state has not been by accident, but has been navigated with the compass of equality firmly\nin hand, constructed with a pointer balanced carefully on the pivot of equal protection.\n       5One   commentator has found that, since the same-sex-marriage debate started,\ntwenty-seven states have passed constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage,\nand seventeen of those state amendments also ban other official forms of same-sex\nrelationships, such as civil unions. Ben Schuman, Note, Gods & Gays: Analyzing the Same-\nSex Marriage Debate from a Religious Perspective, 96 Geo. L.J. 2103, 2106–08 (2008). Only\none state has recognized same-sex marriage, while several other states recognize civil\nunions or another form of same-sex relationship. Id.; Elizabeth F. Emens, Intimate\nDiscrimination: The State’s Role in the Accidents of Sex and Love, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 1307,\n1315 & n.18 (2009) (noting only Massachusetts and Connecticut allow same-sex marriage,\nwhile the legality of same-sex marriage in California is currently “in flux”).\n\f                                             19\n\n\n       B. Legal Tests to Gauge Equal Protection.                        The foundational\n\nprinciple of equal protection is expressed in article I, section 6 of the Iowa\n\nConstitution, which provides:           “All laws of a general nature shall have a\n\nuniform operation; the general assembly shall not grant to any citizen or\n\nclass of citizens, privileges or immunities, which, upon the same terms shall\n\nnot equally belong to all citizens.” See also Iowa Const. art. I, § 1 (“All men\n\nand women are, by nature, free and equal . . . .”); id. art. I, § 2 (recognizing\n\n“[a]ll political power is inherent in the people” and “[g]overnment is instituted\n\nfor the protection, security, and benefit of the people”).                Like the Federal\n\nEqual Protection Clause found in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution, Iowa’s constitutional promise of equal protection “ ‘is\n\nessentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated\n\nalike.’ ”6   Racing Ass’n of Cent. Iowa v. Fitzgerald, 675 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Iowa\n\n2004) [hereinafter RACI II] (quoting City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,\n\n473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 3254, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313, 320 (1985)).\n\n       Even in the zealous protection of the constitution’s mandate of equal\n\nprotection, courts must give respect to the legislative process and presume\n\n\n        6Plaintiffs’ challenge to Iowa Code section 595.2 is based on the equal protection\n\nguarantee in the Iowa Constitution and does not implicate federal constitutional protections.\nGenerally, we view the federal and state equal protection clauses as “identical in scope,\nimport, and purpose.” Callender, 591 N.W.2d at 187. At the same time, we have jealously\nguarded our right to “employ a different analytical framework” under the state equal\nprotection clause as well as to independently apply the federally formulated principles.\nRacing Ass’n of Cent. Iowa v. Fitzgerald, 675 N.W.2d 1, 4–7 (Iowa 2004). Here again, we find\nfederal precedent instructive in interpreting the Iowa Constitution, but we refuse to follow it\nblindly.\n        The United States Supreme Court has not resolved the broad question of whether an\nabsolute ban of marriages between persons of the same sex violates the Federal Equal\nProtection Clause. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578, 123 S. Ct. at 2484, 156 L. Ed. 2d at 525\n(noting that case does not decide “whether the government must give formal recognition to\nany relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter”). Nor has the Court resolved many\nof the narrower legal questions presented by this lawsuit. Nonetheless, the federal\nframework traditionally employed for resolution of equal protection cases provides a useful\nstarting point for evaluation of Iowa’s constitutional equal protection provision.\n\f                                       20\n\n\nits enactments are constitutional.      We understand that Iowa’s tripartite\n\nsystem of government requires the legislature to make difficult policy\n\nchoices, including distributing benefits and burdens amongst the citizens of\n\nIowa. In this process, some classifications and barriers are inevitable. As a\n\nresult, courts pay deference to legislative decisions when called upon to\n\ndetermine whether the Iowa Constitution’s mandate of equality has been\n\nviolated by legislative action. More specifically, when evaluating challenges\n\nbased on the equal protection clause, our deference to legislative policy-\n\nmaking is primarily manifested in the level of scrutiny we apply to review\n\nlegislative action.\n\n      In most cases, we apply a very deferential standard known as the\n\n“rational basis test.” Id. Under the rational basis test, “[t]he plaintiff has the\n\nheavy burden of showing the statute unconstitutional and must negate every\n\nreasonable basis upon which the classification may be sustained.” Bierkamp\n\nv. Rogers, 293 N.W.2d 577, 579–80 (Iowa 1980).             In deference to the\n\nlegislature, a statute will satisfy the requirements of the equal protection\n\nclause\n\n      “so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the\n      classification, the legislative facts on which the classification is\n      apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true\n      by the governmental decisionmaker, and the relationship of the\n      classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the\n      distinction arbitrary or irrational.”\n\nRACI II, 675 N.W.2d at 7 (quoting Fitzgerald v. Racing Ass’n of Cent. Iowa,\n\n539 U.S. 103, 107, 123 S. Ct. 2156, 2159, 156 L. Ed. 2d 97, 103 (2003)).\n\nAlthough the rational basis test is “deferential to legislative judgment, ‘it is\n\nnot a toothless one’ in Iowa.” Id. at 9 (quoting Mathews v. de Castro, 429\n\nU.S. 181, 185, 97 S. Ct. 431, 434, 50 L. Ed. 2d 389, 394 (1976)).             The\n\nrational basis test defers to the legislature’s prerogative to make policy\n\f                                            21\n\n\ndecisions by requiring only a plausible policy justification, mere rationality of\n\nthe facts underlying the decision and, again, a merely rational relationship\n\nbetween the classification and the policy justification.                Nonetheless, the\n\ndeference built into the rational basis test is not dispositive because this\n\ncourt engages in a meaningful review of all legislation challenged on equal\n\nprotection grounds by applying the rational basis test to the facts of each\n\ncase. Id. (citing Bierkamp, 293 N.W.2d at 581).7\n\n       The constitutional guarantee of equal protection, however, demands\n\ncertain types of statutory classifications must be subjected to closer scrutiny\n\nby courts. See, e.g., Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 2394,\n\n72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 799 (1982) (“[W]e would not be faithful to our obligations\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment if we applied so deferential a standard to\n\nevery classification.”).     Thus, courts apply a heightened level of scrutiny\n\nunder equal protection analysis when reasons exist to suspect “prejudice\n\nagainst discrete and insular minorities . . . which tends seriously to curtail\n\nthe operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to\n\n        7Under a traditional rational basis review, courts are required to accept generalized\n\nreasons to support the legislation, even if the fit between the means and end is far from\nperfect. See McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425–26, 81 S. Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L. Ed. 2d\n393, 399 (1961) (“[L]egislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional\npowers despite the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality.” (Citations\nomitted.)). Moreover, the challengers bear the burden of negating every conceivable rational\nbasis that might support the classification drawn in the statute. FCC v. Beach Commc’ns,\nInc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 2102, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211, 221 (1993). Some legal\ncommentators have suggested that the occasional practice of courts to examine the purpose\nof the law more closely under the rational basis test has actually created an additional\ncategory of equal protection analysis called “rational basis with bite.” See Gayle Lynn\nPettinga, Rational Basis with Bite: Intermediate Scrutiny By Any Other Name, 62 Ind. L.J.\n779, 780 (1987) (“[R]ational basis with bite is simply intermediate scrutiny without an\narticulation of the factors that triggered it . . . .”); Jeremy B. Smith, Note, The Flaws of\nRational Basis with Bite: Why the Supreme Court Should Acknowledge Its Application of\nHeightened Scrutiny to Classifications Based on Sexual Orientation, 73 Fordham L. Rev.\n2769, 2774 (2005); Steven P. Wieland, Note, Gambling, Greyhounds, and Gay Marriage:\nHow the Supreme Court Can Use the Rational-Basis Test to Address Varnum v. Brien, 94\nIowa L. Rev. 413, 438–42 (2008) (suggesting the Iowa Supreme Court apply “rational basis\nwith bite”).\n\f                                            22\n\n\nprotect minorities.” United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152\n\nn.4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 783 n.4, 82 L. Ed. 1234, 1242 n.4 (1938).\n\n       Under this approach, classifications based on race, alienage, or\n\nnational origin and those affecting fundamental rights are evaluated\n\naccording to a standard known as “strict scrutiny.” Sherman v. Pella Corp.,\n\n576 N.W.2d 312, 317 (Iowa 1998). Classifications subject to strict scrutiny\n\nare presumptively invalid and must be narrowly tailored to serve a\n\ncompelling governmental interest. In re S.A.J.B., 679 N.W.2d 645, 649 (Iowa\n\n2004).\n\n       A middle tier of analysis exists between rational basis and strict\n\nscrutiny. This intermediate tier has been applied to statutes classifying on\n\nthe basis of gender or illegitimacy and requires the party seeking to uphold\n\nthe statute to demonstrate the challenged classification is substantially\n\nrelated to the achievement of an important governmental objective.\n\nSherman, 576 N.W.2d at 317.             It is known as “intermediate scrutiny” or\n\n“heightened scrutiny,”8 and groups entitled to this tier of review are often\n\ncalled “quasi-suspect” groups.          See Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. at 445,\n\n105 S. Ct. at 3258, 87 L. Ed. 2d at 324. To survive intermediate scrutiny,\n\nthe law must not only further an important governmental interest and be\n\nsubstantially    related    to   that    interest,   but    the    justification    for   the\n\nclassification    must     be    genuine    and      must    not    depend     on     broad\n\ngeneralizations.     United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533, 116 S. Ct.\n\n2264, 2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735, 751 (1996).\n\n       C. Determination of Constitutional Facts.                   The parties expended\n\nconsiderable effort developing a summary judgment record to assist the\n\n       8References   to “heightened” scrutiny in this opinion are meant to be general;\nheightened scrutiny includes any judicial inquiry more searching than the rational basis\ntest. References to “intermediate” scrutiny discuss a specific level of scrutiny between the\nrational basis test and strict scrutiny.\n\f                                       23\n\n\ndistrict court in deciding the legal issues presented in this case, including\n\nwhich level of scrutiny to apply. Before proceeding to determine these legal\n\nissues, we consider the role of the evidence offered by the parties to support\n\ntheir legal arguments.     The district court excluded some of the offered\n\ntestimony, which the County has raised as an issue on appeal.\n\n       Our   law   recognizes   a   distinction   between   “adjudicative”   and\n\n“legislative” facts.   Greenwood Manor v. Iowa Dep’t of Pub. Health, 641\n\nN.W.2d 823, 836 (Iowa 2002).         Most often, judicial decision-making is\n\npredicated solely on a finding of facts relating to the parties and their\n\nparticular circumstances. Id. These facts are referred to as “adjudicative”\n\nfacts, see id., and the resolution of a dispute over these facts is done within\n\nthe framework of a set of rules to determine the admissibility of evidence\n\ntending to prove such facts. See generally Iowa Rs. Evid. At times, however,\n\njudicial decision-making involves crafting rules of law based on social,\n\neconomic, political, or scientific facts. See 2 John W. Strong, McCormick on\n\nEvidence § 328, at 369 (5th ed. 1999) [hereinafter McCormick on Evidence].\n\nThese facts have been denominated as “legislative” facts and become relevant\n\nto judicial decision-making when courts are required to decide the\n\nconstitutionality of a statute, among other occasions.        Id.   As a result,\n\njudicial decision-making in the context of constitutional issues can involve\n\nthe “process of adapting law to a volatile social-political environment.” Id. at\n\n370.   Legislative facts are relevant in deciding these constitutional issues\n\nbecause courts must normally analyze “whether there exist circumstances\n\nwhich constitutionally either legitimate the exercise of legislative power or\n\nsubstantiate the rationality of the legislative product.”     Id.   In fact, the\n\ncommon role of legislative facts in constitutional cases has led to an\n\nalternative designation of legislative facts called “constitutional facts” to\n\f                                       24\n\n\nbetter describe those facts “which assist a court in forming a judgment on a\n\nquestion of constitutional law.” Kenneth C. Davis, An Approach to Problems\n\nof Evidence in the Administrative Process, 55 Harv. L. Rev. 364, 403 (1942).\n\n      Unlike adjudicative facts, legislative or constitutional facts “may be\n\npresented either formally or informally.”     Welsh v. Branstad, 470 N.W.2d\n\n644, 648 (Iowa 1991). There is no formalized set of rules governing a court’s\n\nability to consider legislative or constitutional facts. See Iowa R.

See generally City of Council Bluffs v. Cain, 342 N.W.2d\n\n810, 816–17 (Iowa 1983) (McCormick, J., dissenting). Thus, constitutional\n\nfacts are introduced into judicial decisions through independent research by\n\njudges and written briefs of the parties, as well as testimony of witnesses.\n\nSee McCormick on Evidence at 381–84. Importantly, constitutional facts are\n\nnot subject to the rules of evidence when presented by a party in the form of\n\nwitness testimony. Conceptually, testimony relating to constitutional facts is\n\nonly presented as authority for the legal decision the court is required to\n\nmake, and it would be inconsistent to apply formal rules of evidence to facts\n\nin the form of testimony that a court can independently obtain and consider\n\nin deciding the case.\n\n      Nonetheless,      courts   consider   the   “actual    truth-content”    of\n\nconstitutional facts. See id. at 382–83. Such facts are generally disputable,\n\nand courts must rely on the most compelling data in order to give needed\n\nintellectual legitimacy to the law or rule crafted by the court. Id. at 383.\n\n      Consequently, we review all of the material tendered by the parties in\n\nthis case to assist us in our review of the constitutionality of the civil\n\f                                      25\n\n\nmarriage statute. The error committed by the trial court in failing to do so is\n\nof no consequence under our de novo reviewing standard.\n\n      D. Similarly Situated People.        The County seeks to undercut the\n\nplaintiffs’ equal protection claim by asserting the plaintiffs are not similarly\n\nsituated to heterosexuals.    We consider this threshold argument before\n\nproceeding to the application of our equal protection test.\n\n      We begin by recognizing the constitutional pledge of equal protection\n\ndoes not prohibit laws that impose classifications.     Chicago & Nw. Ry. v.\n\nFachman, 255 Iowa 989, 996, 125 N.W.2d 210, 214 (1963) (recognizing “it is\n\noften necessary in accomplishing efficient and beneficial legislation to divide\n\nthe subjects upon which it operates into classes”). Many statutes impose\n\nclassifications by granting special benefits or declaring special burdens, and\n\nthe equal protection clause does not require all laws to apply uniformly to all\n\npeople.   Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 2331, 120\n\nL. Ed. 2d 1, 12 (1992). Instead, equal protection demands that laws treat\n\nalike all people who are “ ‘similarly situated with respect to the legitimate\n\npurposes of the law.’ ” RACI II, 675 N.W.2d at 7 (quoting Coll. Area Renters\n\n& Landlord Ass’n v. City of San Diego, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 515, 520 (Cal. Ct.\n\nApp. 1996)) (emphasis omitted).\n\n      This requirement of equal protection—that the law must treat all\n\nsimilarly situated people the same—has generated a narrow threshold test.\n\nUnder this threshold test, if plaintiffs cannot show as a preliminary matter\n\nthat they are similarly situated, courts do not further consider whether their\n\ndifferent treatment under a statute is permitted under the equal protection\n\nclause. See, e.g., Timberland Partners XXI, LLP v. Iowa Dep’t of Revenue, 757\n\nN.W.2d 172, 176–77 (Iowa 2008) (applying threshold analysis); In re Det. of\n\nHennings, 744 N.W.2d 333, 338–40 (Iowa 2008) (same); Grovijohn v. Virjon,\n\f                                       26\n\n\nInc., 643 N.W.2d 200, 204 (Iowa 2002) (same). Not only have we utilized this\n\ntest in the past, but courts from other jurisdictions have confronted it in\n\ncases involving equal protection challenges to statutes that restrict marriage\n\nto opposite-sex couples. See In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 435 n.54\n\n(Cal. 2008) (analyzing and rejecting the government’s threshold argument\n\nthat same-sex couples are not similarly situated to opposite-sex couples);\n\nKerrigan v. Comm’r of Pub. Health, 957 A.2d 407, 423–24 & n.19 (Conn.\n\n2008) (same).\n\n      The County references this threshold test in this case and asserts the\n\nplaintiffs are not similarly situated to opposite-sex couples so as to\n\nnecessitate further equal protection analysis because the plaintiffs cannot\n\n“procreate naturally.” In other words, the County argues the statute does\n\nnot treat similarly situated persons differently, but merely treats dissimilar\n\npersons differently.\n\n      In considering whether two classes are similarly situated, a court\n\ncannot simply look at the trait used by the legislature to define a\n\nclassification under a statute and conclude a person without that trait is not\n\nsimilarly situated to persons with the trait. See Racing Ass’n of Cent. Iowa v.\n\nFitzgerald, 648 N.W.2d 555, 559 (Iowa 2002) (RACI I); Joseph Tussman &\n\nJacobus tenBroek, The Equal Protection of the Laws, 37 Cal. L. Rev. 341,\n\n344–47 (1949) [hereinafter Tussman & tenBroek].           The equal protection\n\nclause does not merely ensure the challenged statute applies equally to all\n\npeople in the legislative classification.   “ ‘[S]imilarly situated’ cannot mean\n\nsimply ‘similar in the possession of the classifying trait.’ All members of any\n\nclass are similarly situated in this respect and consequently, any\n\nclassification whatsoever would be reasonable by this test.”       Tussman &\n\ntenBroek, 37 Cal. L. Rev. at 345. In the same way, the similarly situated\n\f                                            27\n\n\nrequirement cannot possibly be interpreted to require plaintiffs to be\n\nidentical in every way to people treated more favorably by the law. No two\n\npeople or groups of people are the same in every way, and nearly every equal\n\nprotection claim could be run aground onto the shoals of a threshold\n\nanalysis if the two groups needed to be a mirror image of one another. Such\n\na threshold analysis would hollow out the constitution’s promise of equal\n\nprotection.\n\n         Thus, equal protection before the law demands more than the equal\n\napplication of the classifications made by the law. The law itself must be\n\nequal.     See Fachman, 255 Iowa at 998, 125 N.W.2d at 215 (“ ‘The equal\n\nprotection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws . . . .’ ”\n\n(quoting Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369, 6 S. Ct. 1064, 1070, 30\n\nL. Ed. 220, 226 (1886))). In other words, to truly ensure equality before the\n\nlaw, the equal protection guarantee requires that laws treat all those who are\n\nsimilarly situated with respect to the purposes of the law alike. RACI II, 675\n\nN.W.2d at 7. This requirement makes it “impossible to pass judgment on the\n\nreasonableness     of   a   [legislative]    classification   without   taking   into\n\nconsideration, or identifying, the purpose of the law.” Tussman & tenBroek,\n\n37 Cal. L. Rev. at 347. The purposes of the law must be referenced in order\n\nto meaningfully evaluate whether the law equally protects all people similarly\n\nsituated with respect to those purposes.             For these reasons, the trait\n\nasserted by the County is insufficient to support its threshold argument.\n\n         Nevertheless, we have said our marriage laws “are rooted in the\n\nnecessity of providing an institutional basis for defining the fundamental\n\nrelational rights and responsibilities of persons in organized society.” Laws\n\nv. Griep, 332 N.W.2d 339, 341 (Iowa 1983); see also Baehr v. Lewin, 852\n\nP.2d 44, 58 (Haw. 1993) (stating civil marriage is “ ‘a partnership to which\n\f                                       28\n\n\nboth partners bring their financial resources as well as their individual\n\nenergies and efforts’ ” (quoting Gussin v. Gussin, 836 P.2d 484, 491 (Haw.\n\n1992))).   These laws also serve to recognize the status of the parties’\n\ncommitted relationship. See Madison v. Colby, 348 N.W.2d 202, 206 (Iowa\n\n1984) (stating “ ‘the marriage state is not one entered into for the purpose of\n\nlabor and support alone,’ ” but also includes “ ‘the comfort and happiness of\n\nthe parties to the marriage contract’ ” (quoting Price v. Price, 91 Iowa 693,\n\n697–98, 60 N.W. 202, 203 (Iowa 1894)) (emphasis added)); Hamilton v.\n\nMcNeill, 150 Iowa 470, 478, 129 N.W. 480, 482 (1911) (“The marriage to be\n\ndissolved is not a mere contract, but is a status.”); Turner v. Hitchcock, 20\n\nIowa 310, 325 (1866) (Lowe, C.J., concurring) (observing that marriage\n\nchanges the parties’ “legal and social status”).\n\n      Therefore, with respect to the subject and purposes of Iowa’s marriage\n\nlaws, we find that the plaintiffs are similarly situated compared to\n\nheterosexual persons. Plaintiffs are in committed and loving relationships,\n\nmany raising families, just like heterosexual couples.      Moreover, official\n\nrecognition of their status provides an institutional basis for defining their\n\nfundamental relational rights and responsibilities, just as it does for\n\nheterosexual couples. Society benefits, for example, from providing same-\n\nsex couples a stable framework within which to raise their children and the\n\npower to make health care and end-of-life decisions for loved ones, just as it\n\ndoes when that framework is provided for opposite-sex couples.\n\n      In short, for purposes of Iowa’s marriage laws, which are designed to\n\nbring a sense of order to the legal relationships of committed couples and\n\ntheir families in myriad ways, plaintiffs are similarly situated in every\n\nimportant respect, but for their sexual orientation. As indicated above, this\n\ndistinction cannot defeat the application of equal protection analysis through\n\f                                             29\n\n\nthe application of the similarly situated concept because, under this circular\n\napproach, all distinctions would evade equal protection review. Therefore,\n\nwith respect to the government’s purpose of “providing an institutional basis\n\nfor defining the fundamental relational rights and responsibilities of\n\npersons,” same–sex couples are similarly situated to opposite–sex couples.9\n\n       E. Classification        Undertaken        in   Iowa    Code      Section     595.2.\n\nPlaintiffs believe Iowa Code section 595.2 classifies on the bases of gender\n\nand sexual orientation. The County argues the same-sex marriage ban does\n\nnot discriminate on either basis.            The district court held section 595.2\n\nclassifies according to gender. As we will explain, we believe the ban on civil\n\nmarriages between two people of the same sex classifies on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation.\n\n\n\n\n       9While   we have applied the threshold analysis in previous cases, we have, at times,\ndirectly or indirectly infused that analysis with principles traditionally applied in the\ncomplete equal protection analysis. See, e.g., Hennings, 744 N.W.2d at 338–39 (disposing of\nan equal protection claim with a threshold similarly situated analysis, but within that\nthreshold analysis evaluating the relationship of the state’s interest and the classification\nmade by the statute); see also Timberland Partners XXI, LLP, 757 N.W.2d at 176–77\n(implicitly considering relationship between classifications and taxing interests of the state\nby focusing on distinctions in the use of commercial and residential property); Grovijohn,\n643 N.W.2d at 204 (using threshold test to find the notice provisions of the dramshop\nstatute treat all dramshop plaintiffs the same, but determining plaintiff failed to articulate\nhow the adoption of the comparative fault statute altered prior case law finding the notice\nrequirement did not violate equal protection). This approach is almost inevitable for the test\nto have any real value as an analytical tool to resolve equal protection claims.\nConsequently, we question the usefulness of the threshold test and express caution in the\nfuture use of the threshold analysis. See, e.g., Angie Baker, Note, Leapfrogging Over Equal\nProtection Analysis: The Eighth Circuit Sanctions Separate and Unequal Prison Facilities for\nMales and Females in Klinger v. Department of Corrections, 76 Neb. L. Rev. 371, 385 (1999)\n(noting United States Supreme Court has not applied “similarly situated” analysis as a\nthreshold test); Donna Laddy, Can Women Prisoners Be Carpenters? A Proposed Analysis for\nEqual Protection Claims of Gender Discrimination in Educational and Vocational Programming\nat Women’s Prisons, 5 Temple Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 1, 22–23 (1995) (same). Because the\nplaintiffs here satisfy the threshold test we have followed in the past, the outcome in this\ncase would not be affected by abandoning that test now. Therefore, we leave to future\nparties the task of arguing the applicability of the threshold similarly situated analysis in\nfuture cases.\n\f                                      30\n\n\n      The County initially points out that section 595.2 does not explicitly\n\nrefer to “sexual orientation” and does not inquire into whether either\n\nmember of a proposed civil marriage is sexually attracted to the other.\n\nConsequently, it seizes on these observations to support its claim that the\n\nstatute does not establish a classification on the basis of sexual orientation\n\nbecause the same-sex civil marriage ban does not grant or withhold the\n\nbenefits flowing from the statute based on sexual preference. Instead, the\n\nCounty argues, section 595.2 only incidentally impacts disparately upon gay\n\nand lesbian people.\n\n      The County’s position reveals the importance of accurately and\n\nprecisely defining the classification in analyzing all equal protection\n\nchallenges.   The manner in which a classification is defined impacts the\n\nutility of an equal protection analysis as a means of revealing discrimination.\n\nTherefore, it is critical that a court reviewing the statute identify the true\n\nnature of the classification.\n\n      It is true the marriage statute does not expressly prohibit gay and\n\nlesbian persons from marrying; it does, however, require that if they marry,\n\nit must be to someone of the opposite sex. Viewed in the complete context of\n\nmarriage, including intimacy, civil marriage with a person of the opposite sex\n\nis as unappealing to a gay or lesbian person as civil marriage with a person\n\nof the same sex is to a heterosexual.      Thus, the right of a gay or lesbian\n\nperson under the marriage statute to enter into a civil marriage only with a\n\nperson of the opposite sex is no right at all.     Under such a law, gay or\n\nlesbian individuals cannot simultaneously fulfill their deeply felt need for a\n\ncommitted personal relationship, as influenced by their sexual orientation,\n\nand gain the civil status and attendant benefits granted by the statute.\n\nInstead, a gay or lesbian person can only gain the same rights under the\n\f                                        31\n\n\nstatute as a heterosexual person by negating the very trait that defines gay\n\nand lesbian people as a class—their sexual orientation.           In re Marriage\n\nCases, 183 P.3d at 441. The benefit denied by the marriage statute—the\n\nstatus of civil marriage for same-sex couples—is so “closely correlated with\n\nbeing homosexual” as to make it apparent the law is targeted at gay and\n\nlesbian people as a class.       See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 583, 123 S. Ct. at\n\n2486,    156    L. Ed. 2d   at   529   (O’Connor,   J.,   concurring)   (reviewing\n\ncriminalization of homosexual sodomy and concluding that “[w]hile it is true\n\nthat the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is\n\nconduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual.           Under such\n\ncircumstances, [the] sodomy law is targeted at more than conduct.            It is\n\ninstead directed toward gay persons as a class.”). The Court’s decision in\n\nRomer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 134 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1996),\n\nsupports this conclusion.         Romer can be read to imply that sexual\n\norientation is a trait that defines an individual and is not merely a means to\n\nassociate a group with a type of behavior. See Romer, 517 U.S. at 632, 116\n\nS. Ct. at 1627, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 865–66 (holding an amendment to a state\n\nconstitution pertaining to “homosexual . . . orientation” expresses “animus\n\ntoward the class that it affects”).\n\n        By purposefully placing civil marriage outside the realistic reach of gay\n\nand lesbian individuals, the ban on same-sex civil marriages differentiates\n\nimplicitly on the basis of sexual orientation. See Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 431\n\nn.24; Conaway v. Deane, 932 A.2d 571, 605 (Md. 2007). Thus, we proceed\n\nto analyze the constitutionality of the statute based on sexual orientation\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n        F. Framework for Determining Appropriate Level of Judicial\n\nScrutiny. Our determination that the marriage statute employs a sexual-\n\f                                            32\n\n\norientation-based classification does not, of course, control the outcome of\n\nour equal protection inquiry.        Most statutes, one way or the other, create\n\nclassifications. Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957, 967, 102 S. Ct. 2836,\n\n2845, 73 L. Ed. 2d 508, 518 (1982) (“Classification is the essence of all\n\nlegislation, and only those classifications which are invidious, arbitrary, or\n\nirrational offend the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.”).                    To\n\ndetermine if this particular classification violates constitutional principles of\n\nequal protection, we must next ask what level of scrutiny applies to\n\nclassifications of this type. The County argues the more deferential rational\n\nbasis test should apply, while plaintiffs argue closer scrutiny is appropriate.\n\n       Although neither we nor the United States Supreme Court has decided\n\nwhich level of scrutiny applies to legislative classifications based on sexual\n\norientation, numerous Supreme Court equal protection cases provide a\n\ngeneral framework to guide our analysis under the Iowa Constitution.10 To\n\nsay a general framework exists is not to say the Supreme Court has provided\n\na precise formula for determining when legislative action is subject to a\n\n        10In the past, when a dispute has required this court to choose which level of\n\nscrutiny to apply to a given classification, the United States Supreme Court has already\ndetermined the appropriate level of scrutiny under the Federal Equal Protection Clause.\nSee, e.g., In re Det. of Williams, 628 N.W.2d 447, 452–53 (Iowa 2001) (relying on Supreme\nCourt’s decision that the mentally ill do not comprise a suspect class); Bennett v. City of\nRedfield, 446 N.W.2d 467, 473 (Iowa 1989) (deferring to Supreme Court precedent to\ndetermine employees of city governments do not comprise a suspect class). We have\nroutinely followed the Supreme Court’s lead, and as a result we have not previously\ndeveloped an independent analysis under the Iowa Constitution. See, e.g., Williams, 628\nN.W.2d at 452–53 (noting Supreme Court holding and containing no independent analysis);\nGilleland v. Armstrong Rubber Co., 524 N.W.2d 404, 407 (Iowa 1994) (stating “strict scrutiny\nanalysis only required in few cases involving suspect classes and fundamental rights as\ndefined by Supreme Court”); Bennett, 446 N.W.2d at 473 (noting Supreme Court holding\nand containing no independent analysis); Stracke v. City of Council Bluffs, 341 N.W.2d 731,\n734 (Iowa 1983) (“Because no fundamental right or suspect class, as defined by the United\nStates Supreme Court, is involved in this case, our task is to determine whether a rational\nbasis existed . . . .”). While we again note our authority to develop independent analyses\nunder the Iowa Constitution, we nonetheless view the Supreme Court’s general framework\nfor determining the constitutional “suspectness” of a class as a useful analytical starting\npoint.\n\f                                            33\n\n\nheightened form of scrutiny. See Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. at 472 n.24,\n\n105 S. Ct. at 3272 n.24, 87 L. Ed. 2d at 341 n.24 (Marshall, J., concurring\n\nin part and dissenting in part) (“No single talisman can define those groups\n\nlikely to be the target of classifications offensive to the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment          and   therefore   warranting     heightened      or   strict   scrutiny;\n\nexperience, not abstract logic, must be the primary guide.”); Conaway, 932\n\nA.2d at 606 (“There is no brightline diagnostic, annunciated by . . . the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court, by which a suspect or quasi-suspect class may be readily\n\nrecognized.”).      Instead, the Supreme Court has expressed a number of\n\ngeneral principles to assist in identifying the appropriate level of scrutiny.\n\n       Classifications based on factors like race, alienage, national origin,\n\nsex, or illegitimacy are “so seldom relevant to achievement of any legitimate\n\nstate interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to\n\nreflect prejudice and antipathy.” Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. at 440, 105\n\nS. Ct. at 3254, 87 L. Ed. 2d at 320. Rather than bearing some relationship\n\nto the burdened class’s ability to contribute to society, such classifications\n\noften reflect irrelevant stereotypes. Id. at 440–41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254–55, 87\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 320–21. “For these reasons and because such discrimination is\n\nunlikely to be soon rectified by legislative means,” laws based on these types\n\nof classifications must withstand more intense judicial scrutiny than other\n\ntypes of classifications. Id.\n\n       Instead of adopting a rigid formula to determine whether certain\n\nlegislative classifications warrant more demanding constitutional analysis,\n\nthe Supreme Court has looked to four factors.11 Conaway, 932 A.2d at 606\n\n       11Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Supreme Court in Plyler suggests the significance\nof each of the four factors. Although Plyler does not formulate a specific test, nor even\ndiscuss “factors” per se, the case touches upon each of the four traditional factors:\n       Several formulations might explain our treatment of certain classifications as\n       “suspect.” Some classifications are more likely than others to reflect deep-\n\f                                               34\n\n\n(discussing factors examined by Supreme Court in considering use of\n\nheightened scrutiny). The Supreme Court has considered: (1) the history of\n\ninvidious discrimination against the class burdened by the legislation;12 (2)\n\nwhether the characteristics that distinguish the class indicate a typical class\n\nmember’s ability to contribute to society;13 (3) whether the distinguishing\n\n\n\n       seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of some\n       legitimate objective. Legislation predicated on such prejudice is easily\n       recognized as incompatible with the constitutional understanding that each\n       person is to be judged individually and is entitled to equal justice under the\n       law. Classifications treated as suspect tend to be irrelevant to any proper\n       legislative goal. Finally, certain groups, indeed largely the same groups, have\n       historically been “relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to\n       command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”\n       The experience of our Nation has shown that prejudice may manifest itself in\n       the treatment of some groups. Our response to that experience is reflected in\n       the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Legislation\n       imposing special disabilities upon groups disfavored by virtue of\n       circumstances beyond their control suggests the kind of “class or caste”\n       treatment that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to abolish.\nPlyler, 457 U.S. at 217 n.14, 102 S.

U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699, 725 (9th Cir.\n1989) (Norris, J., concurring))). Some courts view the Supreme Court’s precedent as\naccording greater weight to the first two factors, see, e.g., Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 426 (“It\nbears emphasis, however, that the United States Supreme Court has placed far greater\nweight—indeed, it invariably has placed dispositive weight—on the first two factors, that is,\nwhether the group has been the subject of long-standing and invidious discrimination and\nwhether the group’s distinguishing characteristic bears no relation to the ability of the group\nmembers to perform or function in society.”), or as suggesting the factors are alternative\nmeans to heightening scrutiny of a legislative classification, id. at 440 (noting “ ‘a suspect\nclass is one saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful\nunequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command\nextraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process’ ” (quoting Murgia, 427 U.S.\nat 313, 96 S.

They have been critical to the analysis and could be\n\nconsidered as prerequisites to concluding a group is a suspect or quasi-\n\nsuspect class. However, we consider the last two factors—immutability of\n\nthe characteristic and political powerlessness of the group—to supplement\n\nthe analysis as a means to discern whether a need for heightened scrutiny\n\nexists.\n\n      G. Determination of Appropriate Level of Scrutiny. Guided by the\n\nestablished framework, we next consider each of the four traditional factors\n\nand assess how each bears on the question of whether the constitution\n\ndemands a more searching scrutiny be applied to the sexual-orientation-\n\nbased classification in Iowa’s marriage statute.\n\n      1. History of discrimination against gay and lesbian people. The first\n\nconsideration is whether gay and lesbian people have suffered a history of\n\npurposeful unequal treatment because of their sexual orientation.         The\n\nCounty does not, and could not in good faith, dispute the historical reality\n\nthat gay and lesbian people as a group have long been the victim of\n\npurposeful and invidious discrimination because of their sexual orientation.\n\nThe long and painful history of discrimination against gay and lesbian\n\npersons is epitomized by the criminalization of homosexual conduct in many\n\nparts of this country until very recently. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578–79,\n\n123 S. Ct. 2483–84, 156 L. Ed. 2d at 520 (invalidating criminalization of\n\nhomosexual sodomy in 2003).       Additionally, only a few years ago persons\n\nidentified as homosexual were dismissed from military service regardless of\n\npast dedication and demonstrated valor. Public employees identified as gay\n\nor lesbian have been thought to pose security risks due to a perceived risk of\n\nextortion resulting from a threat of public exposure.     School-yard bullies\n\f                                               38\n\n\nhave psychologically ground children with apparently gay or lesbian sexual\n\norientation in the cruel mortar and pestle of school-yard prejudice. At the\n\nsame time, lesbian and gay people continue to be frequent victims of hate\n\ncrimes.     See Criminal Justice Information Servs. Div., FBI, Hate Crime\n\nStatistics 2007, http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/victims.htm (according to\n\nFBI-collected data, the only hate crimes occurring more frequently than\n\nsexual-orientation-motivated hate crimes are crimes based on race or\n\nreligious bias).\n\n       The Iowa General Assembly has recognized the need to address\n\nsexual-orientation-based discrimination by including sexual orientation as a\n\ncharacteristic protected in the Iowa Civil Rights Act, by defining hate crimes\n\nto include certain offenses committed because of the victim’s sexual\n\norientation, and by prohibiting “harassing or bullying” behavior in schools\n\nbased on sexual orientation. See Iowa Code §§ 216.2–.18A (Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct)    (sexual-orientation-based           discrimination);       id.    § 280.28       (school\n\nharassment and bullying); id. § 729A.2 (hate crimes committed because of\n\nthe victim’s sexual orientation). These statutory enactments demonstrate a\n\nlegislative recognition of the need to remedy historical sexual-orientation-\n\nbased discrimination.17\n\n       In sum, this history of discrimination suggests any legislative burdens\n\nplaced on lesbian and gay people as a class “are more likely than others to\n\n\n       17Additional    legal authority abounds demonstrating the history of discrimination.\nSee, e.g., In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (finding “sexual orientation is a\ncharacteristic . . . that is associated with a stigma of inferiority and second-class citizenship,\nmanifested by the group’s history of legal and social disabilities); Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 432–\n33 (concluding gay and lesbian people have “been subjected to and stigmatized by a long\nhistory of purposeful and invidious discrimination,” and recounting numerous legal and\nscientific authorities); Dean, 653 A.2d at 344–45 (“Discrimination against homosexuals has\nbeen pervasive in both the public and the private sectors.”); Conaway, 932 A.2d at 609\n(“Homosexual persons have been the object of societal prejudice by private actors as well as\nby the judicial and legislative branches of federal and state governments.”).\n\f                                             39\n\n\nreflect deep-seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of\n\nsome legitimate objective.” Plyler, 457 U.S. at 216 n.14, 102 S. Ct. at 2394\n\nn.14, 72 L. Ed. 2d at 799 n.14. This observation favors an elevated scrutiny\n\nto uncover any such prejudice.\n\n       2. Sexual orientation and the ability to contribute to society. A second\n\nrelevant consideration is whether the characteristic at issue—sexual\n\norientation—is related to the person’s ability to contribute to society.\n\nHeightened scrutiny is applied when the classification bears no relationship\n\nto a person’s ability to contribute to society.             The existence of this factor\n\nindicates the classification is likely based on irrelevant stereotypes and\n\nprejudice.     Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 453.             A classification unrelated to a\n\nperson’s ability to perform or contribute to society typically reflects\n\n“prejudice and antipathy—a view that those in the burdened class are not as\n\nworthy or deserving as others” or “reflect[s] outmoded notions of the relative\n\ncapabilities of persons with the characteristic.”              Cleburne Living Ctr., 473\n\nU.S. at 440–41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254–56, 87 L. Ed. 2d at 320–21.\n\n       Not surprisingly, none of the same-sex marriage decisions from other\n\nstate courts around the nation have found a person’s sexual orientation to\n\nbe indicative of the person’s general ability to contribute to society.18 See,\n\n       18The   County references plaintiffs’ inability to procreate “naturally,” presumably\npointing out each couple’s inability to procreate without assistance. Plaintiffs’ inability to\ncontribute children to society by procreation through sexual intercourse with each other\ndoes not dictate the outcome of our consideration under this factor. The inquiry into gay\nand lesbian people’s ability to contribute to society is a general one, designed to signal\nwhether such classifications routinely risk elevating stereotype over ability. A person’s\nability to procreate is merely one of many ways in which the person can contribute to\nsociety. While the narrower consideration of plaintiffs’ procreative abilities may be relevant\nto whether section 595.2 ultimately passes judicial scrutiny, consideration of those abilities\nis less helpful in determining which level of scrutiny to apply. That is, the inability of gay\nand lesbian partners to contribute by procreation through sexual intercourse with each\nother does not indicate whether legislative classifications based on sexual preference—which\ncan conceivably occur in any legislative subject matter area—will generally be based on\n“stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities.” Murgia, 427 U.S. at 313,\n96 S. Ct. at 2566, 49 L. Ed. 2d at 525.\n\f                                              40\n\n\ne.g., In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442; Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 434–36;\n\nDean v. District of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307, 345 (D.C. 1995); Conaway, 932\n\nA.2d at 609. More importantly, the Iowa legislature has recently declared as\n\nthe public policy of this state that sexual orientation is not relevant to a\n\nperson’s ability to contribute to a number of societal institutions other than\n\ncivil marriage.      See Iowa Code § 216.6 (employment); id. § 216.7 (public\n\naccommodations); id. § 216.8 (housing); id. § 216.9 (education); id. § 216.10\n\n(credit practices).19 Significantly, we do not construe Iowa Code chapter 216\n\nto allow marriage between persons of the same sex, a construction expressly\n\nforbidden in the Iowa Code. See id. § 216.18A (“[Chapter 216] shall not be\n\n\n       19The    legislature has further indicated the irrelevancy of sexual orientation by\nmandating sex education in the state’s public schools be free of biases relating to sexual\norientation, Iowa Code § 279.50, and by securing personal freedom from violence and\nintimidation due to sexual orientation, id. § 729A.1.              Likewise, numerous state\nadministrative regulations indicate sexual orientation is not relevant to a person’s ability to\ncontribute to society. See Iowa Admin. Code r. 191—48.9 (prohibiting discrimination in\nmaking or solicitation of viatical settlement contracts on basis of sexual orientation); id. r.\n281—12 (preamble) (ensuring access to education meeting child’s needs and abilities\nregardless of sexual orientation); id. r. 281—12.1 (ordering equal opportunity in educational\nprograms regardless of sexual orientation); id. r. 281—12.3 (ordering school boards to\nconsider the potential disparate impact of student responsibility and discipline policies on\nstudents because of students’ sexual orientation); id. r. 281—68.4 (prohibiting\ndiscrimination in admission process to public charter schools based on sexual orientation);\nid. r. 282—25.3 (labeling denial of participation in benefits of educational program based on\nsexual orientation an “unethical practice”); id. r. 282—26.3 (prohibiting licensed educators\nfrom discriminating based on sexual orientation); id. r. 641—131.7 (allowing public health\ndepartment to take numerous adverse actions against emergency medical care personnel\nwho “practice, condone, or facilitate” discrimination against a patient on the basis of sexual\norientation); id. r. 641—131.8 (allowing public health department to take numerous adverse\nactions against training program or continuing education providers who “practice, condone,\nor facilitate” discrimination against a patient on the basis of sexual orientation); id. r. 641—\n132.10 (allowing denial, probation, revocation, and suspension of authorized emergency\nmedical service programs that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation); id. r. 645—\n282.2 (prohibiting licensed social workers from discriminating on the basis of sexual\norientation); id. r. 645—363.2 (providing that sexual-orientation-based discrimination by\nsign language interpreters or transliterators is unethical); id. r. 657—3.28 (providing that\nsexual-orientation–based discrimination by pharmacy technicians is unethical); id. r. 657—\n8.11 (same for licensed pharmacies, licensed pharmacists, and registered pharmacist-\ninterns); id. r. 661—81.2 (prohibiting entrance of information regarding sexual orientation\ninto Iowa law enforcement intelligence network information system in most circumstances).\n\f                                             41\n\n\nconstrued to allow marriage between persons of the same sex, in accordance\n\nwith chapter 595.”). Rather, we merely highlight the reality that chapter 216\n\nand    numerous       other    statutes     and    regulations      demonstrate       sexual\n\norientation is broadly recognized in Iowa to be irrelevant to a person’s ability\n\nto contribute to society.20        Those statutes and regulations reflect at least\n\nsome measure of legislative and executive awareness that discrimination\n\nbased on sexual orientation is often predicated on prejudice and stereotype\n\nand further express a desire to remove sexual orientation as an obstacle to\n\nthe ability of gay and lesbian people to achieve their full potential. Therefore,\n\nwe must scrutinize more closely those classifications that suggest a law may\n\nbe based on prejudice and stereotype because laws of that nature are\n\n“incompatible with the constitutional understanding that each person is to\n\nbe judged individually and is entitled to equal justice under the law.” Plyler,\n\n457 U.S. at 217 n.14, 102 S. Ct. at 2394 n.14, 72 L. Ed. 2d at 799 n.14.\n\nThus, although we do not interpret chapter 216 to allow same-sex marriage,\n\nwe rely on the legislative judgment underlying chapter 216 to determine the\n\nappropriate level of scrutiny when sexual orientation is the basis for a\n\nstatutory classification. Based on Iowa statutes and regulations, it is clear\n\nsexual orientation is no longer viewed in Iowa as an impediment to the\n\nability of a person to contribute to society.\n\n       3. Immutability of sexual orientation. The parties, consistent with the\n\nsame-sex-marriage        scholarship,      opinions,     and    jurisprudence,       contest\n\n\n        20Other federal and state authority supports such a conclusion. See Kerrigan, 957\n\nA.2d at 435 (relying on Connecticut statutes banning discrimination based on sexual\norientation “in every important economic and social institution and activity that the\ngovernment regulates”); cf. Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 687, 93 S. Ct. at 1771, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 592\n(Brennan, J., plurality opinion) (interpreting congressional protections against gender\ndiscrimination as suggesting legislative determination such classifications are “inherently\ninvidious” and implying significance of “conclusion of coequal branch of Government” in\ndeciding whether to apply heightened scrutiny).\n\f                                      42\n\n\nwhether sexual orientation is immutable or unresponsive to attempted\n\nchange. The County seizes on this debate to argue the summary judgment\n\ngranted by the district court in this case was improper because plaintiffs\n\ncould not prove, as a matter of fact, that sexuality is immutable.         This\n\nargument, however, essentially limits the constitutional relevance of\n\nmutability to those instances in which the trait defining the burdened class\n\nis absolutely impervious to change. To evaluate this argument, we must first\n\nconsider the rationale for using immutability as a factor.\n\n      A human trait that defines a group is “immutable” when the trait\n\nexists “solely by the accident of birth,” Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677,\n\n686, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 1770, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583, 591 (1973) (Brennan, J.,\n\nplurality opinion), or when the person with the trait has no ability to change\n\nit, Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 360, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 2784,\n\n57 L. Ed. 2d 750, 815 (1978). Immutability is a factor in determining the\n\nappropriate level of scrutiny because the inability of a person to change a\n\ncharacteristic that is used to justify different treatment makes the\n\ndiscrimination violative of the rather “ ‘basic concept of our system that legal\n\nburdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility.’ ”\n\nFrontiero, 411 U.S. at 686, 93 S. Ct. at 1770, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 591 (Brennan,\n\nJ., plurality opinion) (quoting Weber v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 406 U.S. 164,\n\n175, 92 S. Ct. 1400, 1407, 31 L. Ed. 2d 768, 779 (1972)); accord Plyler, 457\n\nU.S. at 217 n.14, 102 S. Ct. at 2394 n.14, 72 L.

Additionally, immutability can relate to the scope and\n\npermanency of the barrier imposed on the group. Temporary barriers tend\n\nto be less burdensome on a group and more likely to actually advance a\n\nlegitimate governmental interest. Consequently, such barriers normally do\n\nnot warrant heightened scrutiny. See Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 406, 95\n\nS. Ct. 553, 561, 42 L.

Ed. 2d 63, 72 (1973) (bona fide state resident requirement for college\n\ntuition permissible when students are provided an opportunity to prove they\n\nhave become residents). The permanency of the barrier also depends on the\n\nability of the individual to change the characteristic responsible for the\n\ndiscrimination.   This aspect of immutability may separate truly victimized\n\nindividuals from those who have invited discrimination by changing\n\nthemselves so as to be identified with the group.      As implied by Justice\n\nFerren, in dissent, in Dean:\n\n             The degree to which an individual controls, or cannot\n      avoid, the acquisition of the defining trait, and the relative ease\n      or difficulty with which a trait can be changed, are relevant to\n      whether a classification is “suspect” or “quasi-suspect” because\n      this inquiry is one way of asking whether someone, rather than\n      being victimized, has voluntarily joined a persecuted group and\n      thereby invited the discrimination.\n\n653 A.2d at 346 (Ferren, J., dissenting).\n\n      Importantly, this background reveals courts need not definitively\n\nresolve the nature-versus-nurture debate currently raging over the origin of\n\nsexual orientation in order to decide plaintiffs’ equal protection claims. The\n\nconstitutional relevance of the immutability factor is not reserved to those\n\ninstances in which the trait defining the burdened class is absolutely\n\f                                           44\n\n\nimpossible to change.     Compare Sherman, 576 N.W.2d at 317 (suggesting\n\nheightened scrutiny is applicable to gender classifications), with Iowa Code\n\n§ 144.23 (providing legal procedure to obtain new birth certificate indicating\n\nchange in gender). That is, we agree with those courts that have held the\n\nimmutability “prong of the suspectness inquiry surely is satisfied when . . .\n\nthe identifying trait is ‘so central to a person’s identity that it would be\n\nabhorrent for government to penalize a person for refusing to change [it].’ ”\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 438 (quoting Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699, 726\n\n(9th Cir. 1989) (Norris, J., concurring in the judgment)); see also In re\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (“Because a person’s sexual orientation is\n\nso integral an aspect of one’s identity, it is not appropriate to require a\n\nperson to repudiate or change his or her sexual orientation in order to avoid\n\ndiscriminatory treatment.”).\n\n      In this case, the County acknowledges sexual orientation is highly\n\nresistant to change.     Additionally, “sexual orientation ‘forms a significant\n\npart of a person’s identity.’ ”     Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 438 (quoting Able v.\n\nUnited States, 968 F. Supp. 850, 863 (E.D.N.Y. 1997), rev’d on other\n\ngrounds, 155 F.3d 628 (2d Cir. 1998)).          Sexual orientation influences the\n\nformation of personal relationships between all people—heterosexual, gay, or\n\nlesbian—to fulfill each person’s fundamental needs for love and attachment.\n\nAccordingly, because sexual orientation is central to personal identity and\n\n“ ‘may be altered [if at all] only at the expense of significant damage to the\n\nindividual’s sense of self,’ ” classifications based on sexual orientation “are\n\nno less entitled to consideration as a suspect or quasi-suspect class than\n\nany   other   group    that   has   been    deemed   to   exhibit   an   immutable\n\ncharacteristic.”   Id. at 438–39 (quoting Jantz v. Muci, 759 F. Supp. 1543,\n\n1548 (D. Kan. 1991), rev’d on other grounds, 976 F.2d 623 (10th Cir. 1992)).\n\f                                       45\n\n\nSexual orientation is not the type of human trait that allows courts to relax\n\ntheir standard of review because the barrier is temporary or susceptible to\n\nself-help.\n\n         4. Political powerlessness of lesbian and gay people. As observed, the\n\npolitical power of the burdened class has been referenced repeatedly in\n\nSupreme Court cases determining the level of scrutiny to be applied to a\n\ngiven piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the Court has never defined what it\n\nmeans to be politically powerless for purposes of this analysis, nor has it\n\nquantified a maximum amount of political power a group may enjoy while\n\nstill receiving the protection from unfair discrimination accompanying\n\nheightened scrutiny. The County points to the numerous legal protections\n\ngay and lesbian people have secured against discrimination, and the County\n\nargues those protections demonstrate gay and lesbian people are not a\n\npolitically powerless class. The County’s argument implies gay and lesbian\n\npeople must be characterized by a complete, or nearly complete, lack of\n\npolitical power before courts should subject sexual-orientation-based\n\nlegislative burdens to a heightened scrutiny.\n\n         Notwithstanding the lack of a mathematical equation to guide the\n\nanalysis of this factor, a number of helpful general principles related to the\n\npolitical power of suspect classes can be culled from the Supreme Court’s\n\ncases.     First, these cases show absolute political powerlessness is not\n\nnecessary to subject legislative burdens on a certain class to heightened\n\nscrutiny. For example, females enjoyed at least some measure of political\n\npower when the Supreme Court first heightened its scrutiny of gender\n\nclassifications. See Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685–88 & n.17, 93 S. Ct. at 1769–\n\n72 & n.17, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 591–92 & n.17 (Brennan, J., plurality opinion)\n\n(subjecting gender classifications to heightened scrutiny after observing Civil\n\f                                           46\n\n\nRights Act of 1964 and Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibited sex discrimination\n\nand noting “the position of women in America [had] improved markedly” by\n\n1973 such that “women [did] not constitute a small and powerless\n\nminority”).\n\n       Second, Supreme Court jurisprudence establishes that a group’s\n\ncurrent political powerlessness is not a prerequisite to enhanced judicial\n\nprotection. “[I]f a group’s current political powerlessness [was] a prerequisite\n\nto a characteristic’s being considered a constitutionally suspect basis for\n\ndifferential treatment, it would be impossible to justify the numerous\n\ndecisions that continue to treat sex, race, and religion as suspect\n\nclassifications.” In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 443. Race continues to\n\nbe a suspect classification, Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326, 123 S. Ct.\n\n2325, 2337, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304, 331 (2003), even though racial minorities\n\nenjoy growing political power.21         Likewise, gender classifications receive\n\nvarious forms of heightened scrutiny, even though women continue to gain\n\npolitical power. See, e.g., Virginia, 518 U.S. at 532–33, 116 S. Ct. at 2275,\n\n135 L. Ed. 2d at 751–52 (applying intermediate scrutiny).\n\n       While a more in-depth discussion of the history of the political-power\n\nfactor is possible, see Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 439–44, we are satisfied, for the\n\npurpose of analyzing the Iowa Constitution, the political powerlessness\n\nfactor of the level-of-scrutiny inquiry does not require a showing of absolute\n\npolitical powerlessness.     Rather, the touchstone of the analysis should be\n\n“whether the group lacks sufficient political strength to bring a prompt end\n\n\n\n\n        21By one measure—occupation of public office—the political power of racial\n\nminorities is unbounded in this country today. This fact was on display January 20, 2009,\nwhen Barack H. Obama, the African-American son of a native Kenyan, was inaugurated as\nthe forty-fourth President of the United States of America.\n\f                                             47\n\n\nto the prejudice and discrimination through traditional political means.” Id.\n\nat 444.\n\n       It is also important to observe that the political power of gays and\n\nlesbians,      while   responsible     for     greater     acceptance    and     decreased\n\ndiscrimination, has done little to remove barriers to civil marriage. Although\n\na small number of state legislatures have approved civil unions for gay and\n\nlesbian people without judicial intervention, no legislature has secured the\n\nright to civil marriage for gay and lesbian people without court order.22 The\n\nmyriad statutes and regulatory protections against discrimination based on\n\nsexual    orientation     in    such   areas      as     employment,    housing,     public\n\naccommodations, and education have not only been absent in the area of\n\nmarriage, but legislative bodies have taken affirmative steps to shore up the\n\nconcept of traditional marriage by specifically excluding gays and lesbians.\n\nLike Iowa, over forty other states have passed statutes or constitutional\n\namendments to ban same-sex marriages. See Ben Schuman, Note, Gods &\n\nGays: Analyzing the Same-Sex Marriage Debate From a Religious Perspective,\n\n96 Geo. L.J. 2103, 2107–08 (2008) (recognizing forty-two states with laws\n\nprohibiting     same-sex       marriage   as    of     November 8,     2007)   [hereinafter\n\nSchuman]; Human Rights Campaign, Statewide Marriage Prohibitions (2008),\n\navailable       at     http://www.hrc.org/documents/marriage_prohibitions.pdf\n\n(mapping states’ enactment of marriage prohibitions). Thus, although equal\n\nrights for gays and lesbians have been increasingly recognized in the political\n\n       22See  Misha Isaak, Comment, “What’s in a Name?”: Civil Unions & the Constitutional\nSignificance of “Marriage,” 10 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 607, 608 & n.7 (2008) [hereinafter Isaak]\n(noting limited success in obtaining legal status for same-sex marriage, including passage of\nsame-sex civil unions in only two states and same-sex civil marriage in only one); Justin\nReinheimer, What Lawrence Should Have Said: Reconstructing an Equality Approach, 96\nCal. L. Rev. 505, 516–17 & n.46 (2008) (reviewing status of state laws relating to legal\nrecognition of same-sex relationships and noting only the California legislature has (twice)\npassed a law allowing same-sex civil marriage (which was twice vetoed by that state’s\ngovernor)).\n\f                                      48\n\n\narena, the right to civil marriage is a notable exception to this trend.\n\nConsequently, the specific right sought in this case has largely lacked any\n\nextensive political support and has actually experienced an affirmative\n\nbacklash.\n\n      We are convinced gay and lesbian people are not so politically powerful\n\nas to overcome the unfair and severe prejudice that history suggests\n\nproduces discrimination based on sexual orientation.        Gays and lesbians\n\ncertainly possess no more political power than women enjoyed four decades\n\nago when the Supreme Court began subjecting gender-based legislation to\n\ncloser scrutiny.     Additionally, gay and lesbian people are, as a class,\n\ncurrently no more powerful than women or members of some racial\n\nminorities. These facts demonstrate, at the least, the political-power factor\n\ndoes not weigh against heightened judicial scrutiny of sexual-orientation-\n\nbased legislation.\n\n      5. Classifications based on sexual orientation demand closer scrutiny.\n\nIn summarizing the rationale supporting heightened scrutiny of legislation\n\nclassifying on the basis of sexual orientation, it would be difficult to improve\n\nupon the words of the Supreme Court of Connecticut:\n\n      Gay persons have been subjected to and stigmatized by a long\n      history of purposeful and invidious discrimination that\n      continues to manifest itself in society. The characteristic that\n      defines the members of this group—attraction to persons of the\n      same sex—bears no logical relationship to their ability to\n      perform in society, either in familial relations or otherwise as\n      productive citizens. Because sexual orientation is such an\n      essential component of personhood, even if there is some\n      possibility that a person’s sexual preference can be altered, it\n      would be wholly unacceptable for the state to require anyone to\n      do so. Gay persons also represent a distinct minority of the\n      population. It is true, of course, that gay persons recently have\n      made significant advances in obtaining equal treatment under\n      the law. Nonetheless, we conclude that, as a minority group\n      that continues to suffer the enduring effects of centuries of\n      legally sanctioned discrimination, laws singling them out for\n      disparate treatment are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny\n\f                                           49\n\n       to ensure that those laws are not the product of such historical\n       prejudice and stereotyping.\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 432. But see Conaway, 932 A.2d at 609–14 (holding\n\nsexual-orientation-based legislation is not entitled to heightened scrutiny\n\nbecause lesbian and gay people are not politically powerless); Andersen, 138\n\nP.3d at 974 (determining plaintiffs failed to satisfy burden to prove\n\nhomosexuality is not an immutable trait and consequently holding sexual-\n\norientation-based distinctions do not demand closer judicial scrutiny). We\n\nagree with the observations of the Connecticut Supreme Court. The factors\n\nestablished to guide our determination of the level of scrutiny to utilize in\n\nour examination of the equal protection claim in this case all point to an\n\nelevated level of scrutiny. Accordingly, we hold that legislative classifications\n\nbased on sexual orientation must be examined under a heightened level of\n\nscrutiny under the Iowa Constitution.\n\n       H. Application of Heightened Scrutiny.                 Plaintiffs argue sexual-\n\norientation-based statutes should be subject to the most searching scrutiny.\nThe County asserts Iowa’s marriage statute, section 595.2, may be reviewed,\n\nat most, according to an intermediate level of scrutiny. Because we conclude\n\nIowa’s same-sex marriage statute cannot withstand intermediate scrutiny,\nwe need not decide whether classifications based on sexual orientation are\n\nsubject to a higher level of scrutiny. Thus, we turn to a discussion of the\n\nintermediate scrutiny standard.23\n\n       23Plaintiffsand some amici urge us to abandon the traditional tiered analysis. This\nview is supported by commentators, at least one of which points out no new suspect or\nquasi-suspect class has been identified since the 1970s and argues the notion of suspect\nclasses is a dead letter in federal constitutional law. See Evan Gerstman, Same Sex\nMarriage & the Constitution 61–63 (2004). The “rigidified” tiered approach has long had its\ndetractors, see, e.g., San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist., 411 U.S. at 98, 93 S. Ct. at 1330, 36\nL. Ed. 2d at 81 (Marshall, J., dissenting), and other states have exercised corresponding\nsovereign authority to adopt balancing tests in equal protection cases, see, e.g., State v.\nOstrosky, 667 P.2d 1184, 1192–93 (Alaska 1983); Greenberg v. Kimmelman, 494 A.2d 294,\n302 (N.J. 1985); Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 878 (Vt. 1999). Although a more flexible\nanalysis is arguably more reflective of Iowa’s constitutional equality mandates and related\n\f                                              50\n\n\n       1. Intermediate scrutiny standard.                 “To withstand intermediate\n\nscrutiny, a statutory classification must be substantially related to an\n\nimportant governmental objective.” Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108\n\nS. Ct. 1910, 1914, 100 L. Ed. 2d 465, 472 (1988).                          In applying an\n\nintermediate standard to review gender-based classifications, the Supreme\n\nCourt has stated:         “Focusing on the differential treatment or denial of\n\nopportunity for which relief is sought, the reviewing court must determine\n\nwhether the proffered justification is ‘exceedingly persuasive.’ ” Virginia, 518\n\nU.S. at 532–33, 116 S. Ct. at 2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751.                       To this end,\n\ncourts evaluate whether the proffered governmental objectives are important\n\nand whether the statutory classification is “ ‘substantially related to the\n\nachievement of those objectives.’ ”            Id. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at 2275, 135\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 751 (quoting Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724,\n\n102 S. Ct. 3331, 3336, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1090, 1098 (1982)).\n\n       2. Statutory classification:        exclusion of gay and lesbian people from\n\ncivil marriage.      To identify the statutory classification, we focus on the\n\n“differential treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought.” Id.\n\nat 532–33, 116 S. Ct. at 2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751 (considering “categorical\n\nexclusion” of women from institution of higher education). Plaintiffs bring\n\nthis lawsuit complaining of their exclusion from the institution of civil\n\n\njurisprudence, we recognize it is sometimes prudent to delay consideration of a new analysis\nto subsequent cases when the change can be more fully explored. See RACI II, 675 N.W.2d\nat 6 (“[I]t is prudent to delay any consideration of whether a different analysis is appropriate\nto a case in which this issue was thoroughly briefed and explored.” (citing In re Det. of\nGarren, 620 N.W.2d 275, 280 n.1 (Iowa 2000)). And while plaintiffs have urged us to adopt\na balancing standard, the parties’ application of equal protection principles to the facts of\nthis case has focused on the tiered approach. We also conclude we are able to adequately\nfulfill our “constitutional obligation as the highest court of this sovereign state to determine\nwhether the challenged classification violates Iowa’s constitutional equality provision” by\nusing the traditional approach in this case. Id. at 4. While we once again reaffirm our\nsovereign authority “to employ a different analytical framework under state constitutional\nprovisions,” RACI II, 675 N.W.2d at 5, we decline to adopt a new approach in this case.\n\f                                              51\n\n\nmarriage.        In response, the County offers support for the legislature’s\n\ndecision to statutorily establish heterosexual civil marriage.                   Because the\n\nrelevant focal point is the opportunity sought by the plaintiffs, the issue\n\npresented by this lawsuit is whether the state has “exceedingly persuasive”\n\nreasons for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples, not whether state-\n\nsanctioned, heterosexual marriage is constitutional.                  See id. at 531, 116\n\nS. Ct. at 2274, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751. Thus, the question we must answer is\n\nwhether excluding gay and lesbian people from civil marriage is substantially\n\nrelated to any important governmental objective.\n\n       3. Governmental objectives.           The County has proffered a number of\n\nobjectives supporting the marriage statute. These objectives include support\n\nfor the “traditional” institution of marriage, the optimal procreation and\n\nrearing of children, and financial considerations.24\n\n       The first step in scrutinizing a statutory classification can be to\n\ndetermine whether the objectives purportedly advanced by the classification\n\nare important.        “The burden of justification is demanding and it rests\n\nentirely on the State.” Id. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at 2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751.\n\nWhere we find, or can assume, the proffered governmental interests are\n\nsufficiently weighty to be called “important,” the critical inquiry is whether\n\nthese governmental objectives can fairly be said to be advanced by the\n\nlegislative classification. See, e.g., Fed. Land Bank v. Arnold, 426 N.W.2d\n\n       24Other   jurisdictions considering the validity of legislative exclusion of gay and\nlesbian people from civil marriage have considered alternative justifications. See, e.g.,\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 476 (uniformity with laws of other jurisdictions); id. at 518 (Zarella, J.,\ndissenting) (regulation of heterosexual procreation); Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1, 32–\n34 (N.Y. 2006) (Kaye, C.J., dissenting) (moral disapproval, uniformity with other\njurisdictions); Andersen, 138 P.3d at 982 (avoid “the need to resolve the sometimes\nconflicting rights and obligations of the same-sex couple and the necessary third party in\nrelation to a child”). We need not independently analyze these alternative justifications as\nthey are not offered to support the Iowa statute. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at\n2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751 (“The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or\ninvented post hoc in response to litigation.”).\n\f                                     52\n\n\n153, 156 (Iowa 1988) (“First we must examine the legitimacy of the end to be\n\nachieved; we then scrutinize the means used to achieve that end.”). In this\n\nanalysis, we drill down to analyze the “link between classification and\n\nobjective.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632, 116 S. Ct. at 1627, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 866.\n\n      a. Maintaining traditional marriage.    First, the County argues the\n\nsame-sex marriage ban promotes the “integrity of traditional marriage” by\n\n“maintaining the historical and traditional marriage norm ([as] one between\n\na man and a woman).” This argument is straightforward and has superficial\n\nappeal. A specific tradition sought to be maintained cannot be an important\n\ngovernmental objective for equal protection purposes, however, when the\n\ntradition is nothing more than the historical classification currently\n\nexpressed in the statute being challenged. When a certain tradition is used\n\nas both the governmental objective and the classification to further that\n\nobjective, the equal protection analysis is transformed into the circular\n\nquestion of whether the classification accomplishes the governmental\n\nobjective, which objective is to maintain the classification. In other words,\n\nthe equal protection clause is converted into a “ ‘barren form of words’ ”\n\nwhen “ ‘discrimination . . . is made an end in itself.’ ” Tussman & tenBroek,\n\n37 Cal. L. Rev. at 357 (quoting Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S. Ct. 7,\n\n10, 60 L. Ed. 131, 135 (1915)).\n\n      This precise situation is presented by the County’s claim that the\n\nstatute in this case exists to preserve the traditional understanding of\n\nmarriage. The governmental objective identified by the County—to maintain\n\nthe traditional understanding of marriage—is simply another way of saying\n\nthe governmental objective is to limit civil marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\nOpposite-sex marriage, however, is the classification made under the\n\nstatute, and this classification must comply with our principles of equal\n\f                                       53\n\n\nprotection. Thus, the use of traditional marriage as both the governmental\n\nobjective and the classification of the statute transforms the equal protection\n\nanalysis into the question of whether restricting marriage to opposite-sex\n\ncouples accomplishes the governmental objective of maintaining opposite-sex\n\nmarriage.\n\n        This approach is, of course, an empty analysis.          It permits a\n\nclassification to be maintained “ ‘for its own sake.’ ” Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n478 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 635, 116 S. Ct. at 1629, 134 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n868).    Moreover, it can allow discrimination to become acceptable as\n\ntradition and helps to explain how discrimination can exist for such a long\n\ntime. If a simple showing that discrimination is traditional satisfies equal\n\nprotection, previous successful equal protection challenges of invidious\n\nracial and gender classifications would have failed.     Consequently, equal\n\nprotection demands that “ ‘the classification ([that is], the exclusion of gay\n\n[persons] from civil marriage) must advance a state interest that is separate\n\nfrom the classification itself.’ ” Id. (quoting Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d\n\n1, 33 (N.Y. 2006) (Kaye, C.J., dissenting)); see also Romer, 517 U.S. at 635,\n\n116 S. Ct. at 1629, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 868 (rejecting “classification of persons\n\nundertaken for its own sake”).\n\n        “[W]hen tradition is offered to justify preserving a statutory scheme\n\nthat has been challenged on equal protection grounds, we must determine\n\nwhether the reasons underlying that tradition are sufficient to satisfy\n\nconstitutional requirements.”     Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 478–79 (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, we must analyze the legislature’s objective in maintaining the\n\ntraditional classification being challenged.\n\n        The reasons underlying traditional marriage may include the other\n\nobjectives asserted by the County, objectives we will separately address in\n\f                                             54\n\n\nthis decision. However, some underlying reason other than the preservation\n\nof tradition must be identified.25 Because the County offers no particular\n\ngovernmental reason underlying the tradition of limiting civil marriage to\n\nheterosexual couples, we press forward to consider other plausible reasons\n\nfor the legislative classification.\n\n       b. Promotion of optimal environment to raise children.                        Another\n\ngovernmental objective proffered by the County is the promotion of “child\n\nrearing by a father and a mother in a marital relationship which social\n\nscientists say with confidence is the optimal milieu for child rearing.” This\n\nobjective implicates the broader governmental interest to promote the best\n\ninterests of children.       The “best interests of children” is, undeniably, an\n\nimportant governmental objective.             Yet, we first examine the underlying\n\npremise proffered by the County that the optimal environment for children is\n\nto be raised within a marriage of both a mother and a father.\n\n       Plaintiffs presented an abundance of evidence and research, confirmed\n\nby our independent research, supporting the proposition that the interests of\n\nchildren are served equally by same-sex parents and opposite-sex parents.\n\nOn the other hand, we acknowledge the existence of reasoned opinions that\n\ndual-gender parenting is the optimal environment for children.                         These\n\nopinions, while thoughtful and sincere, were largely unsupported by reliable\n\nscientific studies.26\n\n       25The   preservation of traditional marriage could only be a legitimate reason for the\nclassification if expanding marriage to include others in its definition would undermine the\ntraditional institution. The County has simply failed to explain how the traditional\ninstitution of civil marriage would suffer if same-sex civil marriage were allowed. There is no\nlegitimate notion that a more inclusive definition of marriage will transform civil marriage\ninto something less than it presently is for heterosexuals. Benjamin G. Ledsham, Note,\nMeans to Legitimate Ends: Same-Sex Marriage through the Lens of Illegitimacy-Based\nDiscrimination, 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 2373, 2388 (2007).\n       26The  research appears to strongly support the conclusion that same-sex couples\nfoster the same wholesome environment as opposite-sex couples and suggests that the\ntraditional notion that children need a mother and a father to be raised into healthy, well-\n\f                                            55\n\n\n       Even assuming there may be a rational basis at this time to believe the\n\nlegislative classification advances a legitimate government interest, this\n\nassumed fact would not be sufficient to survive the equal protection analysis\n\napplicable in this case. In order to ensure this classification based on sexual\n\norientation is not borne of prejudice and stereotype, intermediate scrutiny\n\ndemands a closer relationship between the legislative classification and the\n\npurpose of the classification than mere rationality.                Under intermediate\n\nscrutiny,    the   relationship     between      the   government’s       goal   and     the\n\nclassification employed to further that goal must be “substantial.”                  Clark,\n\n486 U.S. at 461, 108 S. Ct. at 1914, 100 L. Ed. 2d at 472.                     In order to\n\nevaluate that relationship, it is helpful to consider whether the legislation is\n\nover-inclusive or under-inclusive.             See RACI II, 675 N.W.2d at 10\n\n(considering under-inclusion and over-inclusion even in the rational basis\n\ncontext).\n\n       A statute is under-inclusive when the classification made in the\n\nstatute “does not include all who are similarly situated with respect to the\n\npurpose of the law.”        Tussman & tenBroek, 37 Cal. L. Rev. at 348.                  An\n\nunder-inclusive statute means all people included in the statutory\n\nclassification have the trait that is relevant to the aim of the statute, but\n\nother people with the trait are not included in the classification. See id. A\n\nstatute is over-inclusive when the classification made in the statute includes\n\nmore persons than those who are similarly situated with respect to the\n\npurpose of the law. See id. at 351. An over-inclusive statute “imposes a\n\nburden upon a wider range of individuals than are included in the class of\n\nthose” with the trait relevant to the aim of the law. Id. As the degree to\n\n\nadjusted adults is based more on stereotype than anything else. In any event, we do not\naddress whether there is a rational basis for the marriage statute, as the sexual-orientation\nclassification made by the statute is subject to a heightened standard of scrutiny.\n\f                                         56\n\n\nwhich a statutory classification is shown to be over-inclusive or under-\n\ninclusive increases, so does the difficulty in demonstrating the classification\n\nsubstantially furthers the legislative goal.\n\n         We begin with the County’s argument that the goal of the same-sex\n\nmarriage ban is to ensure children will be raised only in the optimal milieu.\n\nIn pursuit of this objective, the statutory exclusion of gay and lesbian people\n\nis both under-inclusive and over-inclusive.          The civil marriage statute is\n\nunder-inclusive because it does not exclude from marriage other groups of\n\nparents—such as child abusers, sexual predators, parents neglecting to\n\nprovide child support, and violent felons—that are undeniably less than\n\noptimal parents.       Such under-inclusion tends to demonstrate that the\n\nsexual-orientation-based      classification    is   grounded      in   prejudice   or\n\n“overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or\n\npreferences” of gay and lesbian people, rather than having a substantial\n\nrelationship to some important objective. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, 116\n\nS. Ct.    at   2275,   135   L. Ed. 2d   at    751   (rejecting   use   of   overbroad\n\ngeneralizations to classify).    If the marriage statute was truly focused on\n\noptimal parenting, many classifications of people would be excluded, not\n\nmerely gay and lesbian people.\n\n         Of course, “[r]eform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to\n\nthe phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.”\n\nKnepper v. Monticello State Bank, 450 N.W.2d 833, 837 (Iowa 1990) (citing\n\nWilliamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S. Ct. 461, 465, 99\n\nL. Ed. 563, 573 (1955)). Thus, “[t]he legislature may select one phase of one\n\nfield and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others.” Williamson, 348 U.S.\n\nat 489, 75 S. Ct. at 465, 99 L. Ed. at 573.              While a statute does not\n\nautomatically violate equal protection merely by being under-inclusive, the\n\f                                      57\n\n\ndegree of under-inclusion nonetheless indicates the substantiality of the\n\nrelationship between the legislative means and end.\n\n      As applied to this case, it could be argued the same-sex marriage ban\n\nis just one legislative step toward ensuring the optimal environment for\n\nraising children. Under this argument, the governmental objective is slightly\n\nmore modest. It seeks to reduce the number of same-sex parent households,\n\nnudging our state a step closer to providing the asserted optimal milieu for\n\nchildren.   Even evaluated in light of this narrower objective, however, the\n\nban on same-sex marriage is flawed.\n\n      The ban on same-sex marriage is substantially over-inclusive because\n\nnot all same-sex couples choose to raise children. Yet, the marriage statute\n\ndenies civil marriage to all gay and lesbian people in order to discourage the\n\nlimited number of same-sex couples who desire to raise children. In doing\n\nso, the legislature includes a consequential number of “individuals within\n\nthe statute’s purview who are not afflicted with the evil the statute seeks to\n\nremedy.”    Conaway, 932 A.2d at 649 (Raker, J., concurring in part and\n\ndissenting).\n\n      At the same time, the exclusion of gay and lesbian people from\n\nmarriage is under-inclusive, even in relation to the narrower goal of\n\nimproving child rearing by limiting same-sex parenting. Quite obviously, the\n\nstatute does not prohibit same-sex couples from raising children. Same-sex\n\ncouples currently raise children in Iowa, even while being excluded from civil\n\nmarriage, and such couples will undoubtedly continue to do so. Recognition\n\nof this under-inclusion puts in perspective just how minimally the same-sex\n\nmarriage ban actually advances the purported legislative goal.      A law so\n\nsimultaneously over-inclusive and under-inclusive is not substantially\n\nrelated to the government’s objective. In the end, a careful analysis of the\n\f                                            58\n\n\nover- and under-inclusiveness of the statute reveals it is less about using\n\nmarriage to achieve an optimal environment for children and more about\n\nmerely precluding gay and lesbian people from civil marriage.\n\n       If the statute was truly about the best interest of children, some\n\nbenefit to children derived from the ban on same-sex civil marriages would\n\nbe observable.      Yet, the germane analysis does not show how the best\n\ninterests of children of gay and lesbian parents, who are denied an\n\nenvironment supported by the benefits of marriage under the statute, are\n\nserved by the ban.         Likewise, the exclusion of gays and lesbians from\n\nmarriage does not benefit the interests of those children of heterosexual\n\nparents, who are able to enjoy the environment supported by marriage with\n\nor without the inclusion of same-sex couples.\n\n       The ban on same-sex civil marriage can only logically be justified as a\n\nmeans to ensure the asserted optimal environment for raising children if\n\nfewer children will be raised within same-sex relationships27 or more\n\nchildren will be raised in dual-gender marriages. Yet, the same-sex-marriage\n\nban will accomplish these outcomes only when people in same-sex\n\nrelationships choose not to raise children without the benefit of marriage or\n\nwhen children are adopted by dual-gender couples who would have been\n\nadopted by same-sex couples but for the same-sex civil marriage ban. We\n\ndiscern no substantial support for this proposition.               These outcomes, at\n\nbest, are minimally advanced by the classification.                    Consequently, a\n\nclassification that limits civil marriage to opposite-sex couples is simply not\n\nsubstantially related to the objective of promoting the optimal environment\n\n\n       27The  County does not specifically contend the goal of Iowa’s marriage statute is to\ndeter gay and lesbian couples from having children. Such a claim would raise serious due\nprocess concerns. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 1038, 31\nL. Ed. 2d 349, 362 (1972) (noting due process concern with governmental interference with\ndecision to conceive children).\n\f                                            59\n\n\nto raise children.   This conclusion suggests stereotype and prejudice, or\n\nsome other unarticulated reason, could be present to explain the real\n\nobjectives of the statute.\n\n      c. Promotion    of     procreation.        The   County   also    proposes   that\n\ngovernment endorsement of traditional civil marriage will result in more\n\nprocreation. It points out that procreation is important to the continuation\n\nof the human race, and opposite-sex couples accomplish this objective\n\nbecause procreation occurs naturally within this group.                In contrast, the\n\nCounty points out, same-sex couples can procreate only through assisted\n\nreproductive techniques, and some same-sex couples may choose not to\n\nprocreate.    While heterosexual marriage does lead to procreation, the\n\nargument by the County fails to address the real issue in our required\n\nanalysis of the objective: whether exclusion of gay and lesbian individuals\n\nfrom the institution of civil marriage will result in more procreation?              If\n\nprocreation is the true objective, then the proffered classification must work\n\nto achieve that objective.\n\n      Conceptually, the promotion of procreation as an objective of marriage\n\nis compatible with the inclusion of gays and lesbians within the definition of\n\nmarriage. Gay and lesbian persons are capable of procreation. Thus, the\n\nsole conceivable avenue by which exclusion of gay and lesbian people from\n\ncivil marriage could promote more procreation is if the unavailability of civil\n\nmarriage for same-sex partners caused homosexual individuals to “become”\n\nheterosexual in order to procreate within the present traditional institution\n\nof civil marriage. The briefs, the record, our research, and common sense do\n\nnot suggest such an outcome.           Even if possibly true, the link between\n\nexclusion of gay and lesbian people from marriage and increased procreation\n\nis far too tenuous to withstand heightened scrutiny. Specifically, the statute\n\f                                       60\n\n\nis significantly under-inclusive with respect to the objective of increasing\n\nprocreation because it does not include a variety of groups that do not\n\nprocreate for reasons such as age, physical disability, or choice. In other\n\nwords, the classification is not substantially related to the asserted\n\nlegislative purpose.\n\n      d. Promoting stability in opposite-sex relationships. A fourth suggested\n\nrationale supporting the marriage statute is “promoting stability in opposite\n\nsex relationships.” While the institution of civil marriage likely encourages\n\nstability in opposite-sex relationships, we must evaluate whether excluding\n\ngay and lesbian people from civil marriage encourages stability in opposite-\n\nsex relationships. The County offers no reasons that it does, and we can\n\nfind none.    The stability of opposite-sex relationships is an important\n\ngovernmental interest, but the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage\n\nis not substantially related to that objective.\n\n      e. Conservation of resources. The conservation of state resources is\n\nanother objective arguably furthered by excluding gay and lesbian persons\n\nfrom civil marriage. The argument is based on a simple premise: couples\n\nwho are married enjoy numerous governmental benefits, so the state’s fiscal\n\nburden associated with civil marriage is reduced if less people are allowed to\n\nmarry.   In the common sense of the word, then, it is “rational” for the\n\nlegislature to seek to conserve state resources by limiting the number of\n\ncouples allowed to form civil marriages.      By way of example, the County\n\nhypothesizes that, due to our laws granting tax benefits to married couples,\n\nthe State of Iowa would reap less tax revenue if individual taxpaying gay and\n\nlesbian people were allowed to obtain a civil marriage.     Certainly, Iowa’s\n\nmarriage statute causes numerous government benefits, including tax\n\f                                             61\n\n\nbenefits, to be withheld from plaintiffs.28              Thus, the ban on same-sex\n\nmarriages may conserve some state resources. Excluding any group from\n\ncivil marriage—African-Americans, illegitimates, aliens, even red-haired\n\nindividuals—would conserve state resources in an equally “rational” way.\n\nYet, such classifications so obviously offend our society’s collective sense of\n\nequality that courts have not hesitated to provide added protections against\n\nsuch inequalities.\n\n       One primary requirement of the equal protection clause is a more\n\nsubstantial relationship between the legislative goal and the means used to\n\nattain the goal. When heightened scrutiny is applicable, the means must\n\nsubstantially further the legislative end.            Consequently, in this case, the\n\nsexual-orientation-based         classification    must      substantially     further     the\n\nconservation-of-resources objective.\n\n       As observed in our analysis of the other reasons offered in support of\n\nthe marriage statute, significant degrees of over-inclusion and under-\n\n\n       28Plaintiffs identify over two hundred Iowa statutes affected by civil-marriage status.\nSee, e.g., Iowa Code § 85.31 (dependent surviving spouse receives benefits when spouse\ndeath caused by work injury); id. § 135J.1(4) (hospice patient’s family includes spouse); id.\n§ 142C.4 (spouse has power to make decision concerning anatomical gifts); id. § 144A.7\n(patient’s spouse determines application of life-sustaining procedures in absence of\ndeclaration); id. § 144C.5 (surviving spouse controls disposition of decedent’s remains in\nabsence of declaration); id. § 252A.3(1) (spouse liable for support of other spouse); id.\n§ 252A.3(4) (children of married parents legitimate); id. § 422.7 (spouses may file joint tax\nreturn); id. § 422.9(1) (optional standard deduction for married taxpayers); id. § 422.12(1)(b)\n(spouses eligible for personal exemption credit); id. § 450.3 (inheritance rights of surviving\nspouses); id. § 450.9 (surviving spouse exempt from inheritance tax on property passed from\ndecedent spouse); id. § 450.10(6) (spousal allowance for surviving spouse); id. § 523I.309\n(surviving spouse must consent to decedent spouse’s interment); id. § 613.15 (spouse may\nrecover value of services and support of decedent spouse for wrongful death or negligent\ninjury); id. § 622.9 (restriction of testimony of communication between husband and wife);\nid. § 633.211(1) (surviving spouse receives decedent spouse’s entire estate in intestacy); id.\n§ 633.236 (surviving spouse has right to elective share); id. § 633.272 (surviving spouse\ntakes under partial intestacy if elective share not exercised); id. § 633.336 (damages for\nwrongful death). The Government Accounting Office, as of 2005, had identified more than\n1000 federal legal rights and responsibilities derived from marriage. Isaak, 10 U. Pa. J.\nConst. L. at 607 n.6.\n\f                                       62\n\n\ninclusion shed light on the true relationship between exclusion of gay and\n\nlesbian people from civil marriage and the goal of conserving governmental\n\nresources.     Exclusion of all same-sex couples is an extremely blunt\n\ninstrument for conserving state resources through limiting access to civil\n\nmarriage.     In other words, the exclusion of same-sex couples is over-\n\ninclusive because many same-sex couples, if allowed to marry, would not\n\nuse more state resources than they currently consume as unmarried\n\ncouples.     To reference the County’s example, while many heterosexual\n\ncouples who have obtained a civil marriage do not file joint tax returns—or\n\nexperience any other tax benefit from marital status—many same-sex\n\ncouples may not file a joint tax return either. The two classes created by the\n\nstatute—opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples—may use the same\n\namount of state resources. Thus, the two classes are similarly situated for\n\nthe purpose of conserving state resources, yet the classes are treated\n\ndifferently by the law. In this way, sexual orientation is a flawed indicator of\n\nresource usage.\n\n      Just as exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage is a blunt\n\ninstrument, however, it is also significantly undersized if the true goal is to\n\nconserve state resources.     That is to say, the classification is under-\n\ninclusive.   The goal of conservation of state resources would be equally\n\nserved by excluding any similar-sized group from civil marriage.        Indeed,\n\nunder the County’s logic, more state resources would be conserved by\n\nexcluding groups more numerous than Iowa’s estimated 5800 same-sex\n\ncouples (for example, persons marrying for a second or subsequent time).\n\nImportantly, there is also no suggestion same-sex couples would use more\n\nstate resources if allowed to obtain a civil marriage than heterosexual\n\ncouples who obtain a civil marriage.\n\f                                     63\n\n\n      Such over-inclusion and under-inclusion demonstrates the trait of\n\nsexual orientation is a poor proxy for regulating aspiring spouses’ usage of\n\nstate resources. This tenuous relationship between the classification and its\n\npurpose demonstrates many people who are similarly situated with respect\n\nto the purpose of the law are treated differently. As a result, the sexual-\n\norientation-based classification does not substantially further the suggested\n\ngovernmental interest, as required by intermediate scrutiny.\n\n      4. Conclusion.     Having   examined    each   proffered   governmental\n\nobjective through the appropriate lens of intermediate scrutiny, we conclude\n\nthe sexual-orientation-based classification under the marriage statute does\n\nnot substantially further any of the objectives. While the objectives asserted\n\nmay be important (and many undoubtedly are important), none are\n\nfurthered in a substantial way by the exclusion of same-sex couples from\n\ncivil marriage.   Our equal protection clause requires more than has been\n\noffered to justify the continued existence of the same-sex marriage ban\n\nunder the statute.\n\n      I. Religious Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage. Now that we have\n\naddressed and rejected each specific interest advanced by the County to\n\njustify the classification drawn under the statute, we consider the reason for\n\nthe exclusion of gay and lesbian couples from civil marriage left unspoken by\n\nthe County: religious opposition to same-sex marriage. The County’s silence\n\nreflects, we believe, its understanding this reason cannot, under our Iowa\n\nConstitution, be used to justify a ban on same-sex marriage.\n\n      While unexpressed, religious sentiment most likely motivates many, if\n\nnot most, opponents of same-sex civil marriage and perhaps even shapes the\n\nviews of those people who may accept gay and lesbian unions but find the\n\f                                            64\n\n\nnotion of same-sex marriage unsettling.29             Consequently, we address the\n\nreligious undercurrent propelling the same-sex marriage debate as a means\n\nto fully explain our rationale for rejecting the dual-gender requirement of the\n\nmarriage statute.\n\n       It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to\n\nsame-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex\n\nmarriage, even if only indirectly. Religious objections to same-sex marriage\n\nare   supported      by    thousands       of    years   of   tradition    and     biblical\n\ninterpretation.30      The belief that the “sanctity of marriage” would be\n\nundermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking\n\nconceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining\n\nthe tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples, but better\n\nidentifies the source of the opposition.            Whether expressly or impliedly,\n\nmuch of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere, deeply ingrained—\n\neven fundamental—religious belief.\n\n       Yet, such views are not the only religious views of marriage.                     As\n\ndemonstrated by amicus groups, other equally sincere groups and people in\n\n\n\n\n       29A  survey in the Des Moines Register in 2008 found 28.1% of individuals surveyed\nsupported same-sex marriage, 30.2% opposed same-sex marriage but supported civil\nunions, and 32% of respondents opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions. Erin\nJordan, About 6 in 10 Iowans back same-sex unions, poll finds, Des Moines Register, Nov. 26,\n2008, at 4B. The Des Moines Register survey is consistent with a national survey by the\nPEW Research Center in 2003. This PEW survey found that 59% of Americans oppose\nsame-sex marriage, and 32% favor same-sex marriage. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108.\nHowever, opposition to same-sex marriage jumped to 80% for people “with a high level of\nreligious commitment,” with only 12% of such people in favor of same-sex marriage. Id.\n       30Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2109–12 (discussing the religious arguments against\n\nsame-sex marriage found in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, supporting a\nconclusion that homosexuality is considered to be a sin and same-sex marriage to be an\nextension of that sin).\n\f                                           65\n\n\nIowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the\n\nopposite conclusion.31\n\n       This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of\n\nany religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowa’s same-sex\n\nmarriage ban. Our constitution does not permit any branch of government\n\nto resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of\n\nensuring government avoids them. See Iowa Const. art. I, § 3 (“The general\n\nassembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .”).\n\nThe statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage\n\nfor religious institutions. Instead, the statute declares, “Marriage is a civil\n\ncontract” and then regulates that civil contract. Iowa Code § 595A.1. Thus,\n\nin pursuing our task in this case, we proceed as civil judges, far removed\n\nfrom the theological debate of religious clerics, and focus only on the concept\n\nof civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class\n\nof persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil\n\nmarriage.\n\n       We, of course, have a constitutional mandate to protect the free\n\nexercise of religion in Iowa, which includes the freedom of a religious\n\norganization to define marriages it solemnizes as unions between a man and\n\na woman. See Iowa Const. art. I, § 3 (“The general assembly shall make no\n\nlaw . . . prohibiting the free exercise [of religion] . . . .”). This mission to\n\nprotect religious freedom is consistent with our task to prevent government\n\n\n        31Many religions recognize same-sex marriage, such as Buddhists, Quakers,\n\nUnitarians, and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108.\nAmicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders, Communities, and Scholars point out the\nUnited Church of Christ encourages, but does not require, its local congregations to adopt\nwedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples,\nwhile the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex\nweddings as a matter of pastoral care. Additionally, many groups and clergy within various\nreligions are working to achieve inclusion of same-sex marriage. Id. at 2108–09.\n\f                                        66\n\n\nfrom endorsing any religious view. State government can have no religious\n\nviews, either directly or indirectly, expressed through its legislation.\n\nKnowlton v. Baumhover, 182 Iowa 691, 710, 166 N.W. 202, 208 (1918). This\n\nproposition is the essence of the separation of church and state.\n\n      As a result, civil marriage must be judged under our constitutional\n\nstandards of equal protection and not under religious doctrines or the\n\nreligious views of individuals.       This approach does not disrespect or\n\ndenigrate the religious views of many Iowans who may strongly believe in\n\nmarriage as a dual-gender union, but considers, as we must, only the\n\nconstitutional rights of all people, as expressed by the promise of equal\n\nprotection for all. We are not permitted to do less and would damage our\n\nconstitution immeasurably by trying to do more.\n\n      The only legitimate inquiry we can make is whether [the statute]\n      is constitutional. If it is not, its virtues . . . cannot save it; if it\n      is, its faults cannot be invoked to accomplish its destruction. If\n      the provisions of the Constitution be not upheld when they\n      pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be\n      abandoned.\n\nHome Bldg. & Loan Ass’n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 483, 54 S. Ct. 231, 256,\n\n78 L. Ed. 413, 452 (1934) (Sutherland, J., dissenting).\n\n      In the final analysis, we give respect to the views of all Iowans on the\n\nissue of same-sex marriage—religious or otherwise—by giving respect to our\n\nconstitutional principles. These principles require that the state recognize\n\nboth opposite-sex and same-sex civil marriage. Religious doctrine and views\n\ncontrary to this principle of law are unaffected, and people can continue to\n\nassociate with the religion that best reflects their views.             A religious\n\ndenomination can still define marriage as a union between a man and a\n\nwoman, and a marriage ceremony performed by a minister, priest, rabbi, or\n\nother person ordained or designated as a leader of the person’s religious\n\f                                           67\n\n\nfaith does not lose its meaning as a sacrament or other religious institution.\n\nThe sanctity of all religious marriages celebrated in the future will have the\n\nsame meaning as those celebrated in the past. The only difference is civil\n\nmarriage will now take on a new meaning that reflects a more complete\n\nunderstanding of equal protection of the law.              This result is what our\n\nconstitution requires.\n\n       J. Constitutional Infirmity. We are firmly convinced the exclusion\n\nof gay and lesbian people from the institution of civil marriage does not\n\nsubstantially further any important governmental objective. The legislature\n\nhas excluded a historically disfavored class of persons from a supremely\n\nimportant civil institution without a constitutionally sufficient justification.\n\nThere is no material fact, genuinely in dispute, that can affect this\n\ndetermination.\n\n       We have a constitutional duty to ensure equal protection of the law.\n\nFaithfulness to that duty requires us to hold Iowa’s marriage statute, Iowa\n\nCode section 595.2, violates the Iowa Constitution.              To decide otherwise\n\nwould be an abdication of our constitutional duty. If gay and lesbian people\n\nmust submit to different treatment without an exceedingly persuasive\n\njustification, they are deprived of the benefits of the principle of equal\n\nprotection upon which the rule of law is founded. Iowa Code section 595.2\n\ndenies gay and lesbian people the equal protection of the law promised by\n\nthe Iowa Constitution.32\n       V. Remedy.\n\n       Because our civil marriage statute fails to provide equal protection of\n\nthe law under the Iowa Constitution, we must decide how to best remedy the\n\n\n       32Our  decision that the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Iowa\nConstitution makes it unnecessary to address the other bases for plaintiffs’ challenge to\nIowa’s marriage statute.\n\f                                        68\n\n\nconstitutional violation. The sole remedy requested by plaintiffs is admission\n\ninto the institution of civil marriage.      The County does not suggest an\n\nalternative remedy.     The high courts of other jurisdictions have remedied\n\nconstitutionally invalid bans on same-sex marriage in two ways.             Some\n\ncourts have ordered gay and lesbian people to be allowed to access the\n\ninstitution of civil marriage.   See In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 453;\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 480 (“definition of marriage necessarily must be\n\nexpanded” to include same-sex couples); Opinions of the Justices to the\n\nSenate, 802 N.E.2d 565, 571 (Mass. 2004). Other courts have allowed their\n\nstate legislatures to create parallel civil institutions for same-sex couples.\n\nSee Lewis v. Harris, 908 A.2d 196, 221 (N.J. 2006); Baker v. State, 744 A.2d\n\n864, 887 (Vt. 1999).\n\n      Iowa Code section 595.2 is unconstitutional because the County has\n\nbeen unable to identify a constitutionally adequate justification for excluding\n\nplaintiffs from the institution of civil marriage. A new distinction based on\n\nsexual orientation would be equally suspect and difficult to square with the\n\nfundamental principles of equal protection embodied in our constitution.\n\nThis record, our independent research, and the appropriate equal protection\n\nanalysis do not suggest the existence of a justification for such a legislative\n\nclassification   that   substantially   furthers   any   governmental   objective.\n\nConsequently, the language in Iowa Code section 595.2 limiting civil\n\nmarriage to a man and a woman must be stricken from the statute, and the\n\nremaining statutory language must be interpreted and applied in a manner\n\nallowing gay and lesbian people full access to the institution of civil\n\nmarriage.\n\f                                            69\n\n\n       VI. Conclusion.\n\n       The district court properly granted summary judgment to plaintiffs.\n\nIowa Code section 595.2 violates the equal protection provision of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.        Our     decision     becomes      effective    upon     issuance        of\n\nprocedendo.33\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n       All justices concur.\n\n\n\n\n       33See  Iowa R.

On our review, we hold the Iowa marriage statute\nviolates the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution. Therefore, we\n\naffirm the decision of the district court.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n       This lawsuit is a civil rights action by twelve individuals who reside in\n\nsix communities across Iowa.              Like most Iowans, they are responsible,\n\ncaring, and productive individuals.            They maintain important jobs, or are\n\nretired, and are contributing, benevolent members of their communities.\n\nThey include a nurse, business manager, insurance analyst, bank agent,\n\nstay-at-home parent, church organist and piano teacher, museum director,\n\nfederal employee, social worker, teacher, and two retired teachers.                      Like\n\nmany Iowans, some have children and others hope to have children. Some\n\nare foster parents. Like all Iowans, they prize their liberties and live within\n\nthe borders of this state with the expectation that their rights will be\n\nmaintained and protected—a belief embraced by our state motto.1\n       Despite the commonality shared with other Iowans, the twelve\n\nplaintiffs are different from most in one way.                   They are sexually and\n\nromantically attracted to members of their own sex.                  The twelve plaintiffs\n\ncomprise six same-sex couples who live in committed relationships. Each\n\nmaintains a hope of getting married one day, an aspiration shared by many\n\nthroughout Iowa.\n\n\n\n       1The   state motto of Iowa is: “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.”\nIt is inscribed on the Great Seal of Iowa and on our state flag. See Iowa Code §§ 1A.1, 1B.1\n(2009).\n\f                                            8\n\n\n       Unlike opposite-sex couples in Iowa, same-sex couples are not\n\npermitted to marry in Iowa.          The Iowa legislature amended the marriage\n\nstatute in 1998 to define marriage as a union between only a man and a\n\nwoman.2 Despite this law, the six same-sex couples in this litigation asked\n\nthe Polk County Recorder to issue marriage licenses to them. The recorder,\n\nfollowing the law, refused to issue the licenses, and the six couples have\n\nbeen unable to be married in this state. Except for the statutory restriction\n\nthat defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, the twelve\n\nplaintiffs met the legal requirements to marry in Iowa.\n\n       As other Iowans have done in the past when faced with the\n\nenforcement of a law that prohibits them from engaging in an activity or\n\nachieving a status enjoyed by other Iowans, the twelve plaintiffs turned to\n\nthe courts to challenge the statute.            They seek to declare the marriage\n\nstatute unconstitutional so they can obtain the array of benefits of marriage\n\nenjoyed by heterosexual couples, protect themselves and their children, and\n\ndemonstrate to one another and to society their mutual commitment.\n\n       In turning to the courts, the twelve plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the\n\nPolk County District Court. They claimed the statutory same-sex marriage\n\nban violates certain liberty and equality rights under the Iowa Constitution.\n\nThe individual rights claimed by plaintiffs to be adversely affected (by the\n\naction of the legislative branch in enacting the same-sex marriage ban and\n\nthe action of the government officials of the executive branch in enforcing the\n\nban) included the fundamental right to marry, as well as rights to privacy\n\nand familial association. Additionally, plaintiffs claimed the legislative and\n\n\n\n        2Iowa Code section 595.2(1) provides “[o]nly a marriage between a male and a female\n\nis valid.” All statutory references are to the 2009 Code of Iowa. While some statutes\nreferenced here have been amended since this lawsuit originated, none of the amendments\ndictate the outcome of this case.\n\f                                       9\n\n\nthe executive actions unconstitutionally discriminated against them on\n\nseveral bases, including sexual orientation.\n\n      The case was presented to the district court by means of a summary\n\njudgment motion. The record was developed through witness affidavits and\n\ndepositions. This record included an explanation by some of the plaintiffs of\n\nthe disadvantages and fears they face each day due to the inability to obtain\n\na civil marriage in Iowa. These disadvantages and problems include the legal\n\ninability to make many life and death decisions affecting their partner,\n\nincluding decisions related to health care, burial arrangements, autopsy,\n\nand disposition of remains following death.      Various plaintiffs told of the\n\ninability to share in their partners’ state-provided health insurance, public-\n\nemployee pension benefits, and many private-employer-provided benefits\n\nand protections. They also explained how several tax benefits are denied.\n\nAdoption proceedings are also more cumbersome and expensive for\n\nunmarried partners. Other obstacles presented by the inability to enter into\n\na civil marriage include numerous nongovernmental benefits of marriage\n\nthat are so common in daily life they often go unnoticed, such as something\n\nso simple as spousal health club memberships. Yet, perhaps the ultimate\n\ndisadvantage expressed in the testimony of the plaintiffs is the inability to\n\nobtain for themselves and for their children the personal and public\n\naffirmation that accompanies marriage.\n\n      The parties also explored the reasons for defining marriage in a way\n\nthat denies these benefits to same-sex couples.        The County offered five\n\nprimary interests of society in support of the legislature’s exclusive definition\n\nof marriage. The first three interests are broadly related to the advancement\n\nof child rearing.     Specifically, the objectives centered on promoting\n\nprocreation, promoting child rearing by a mother and a father within a\n\f                                      10\n\n\nmarriage, and promoting stability in an opposite-sex relationship to raise\n\nand nurture children. The fourth interest raised by the County addressed\n\nthe conservation of state resources, while the final reason concerned the\n\ngovernmental interest in promoting the concept and integrity of the\n\ntraditional notion of marriage.\n\n      Much of the testimony presented by the County was in the form of\n\nopinions by various individuals that same-sex marriage would harm the\n\ninstitution of marriage and also harm children raised in same-sex marriages.\n\nTwo college professors testified that a heterosexual marriage is, overall, the\n\noptimal forum in which to raise children. A retired pediatrician challenged\n\nthe accuracy of some of the medical research that concludes there is no\n\nsignificant difference between children raised by same-sex couples and\n\nopposite-sex couples. A clinical psychologist testified sexual orientation is\n\nnot as defined and stable as race and gender and can change over time. He\n\nacknowledged, however, it is difficult to change a person’s sexual orientation,\n\nand efforts to do so can be harmful to the person.\n\n      The plaintiffs produced evidence to demonstrate sexual orientation\n\nand gender have no effect on children raised by same-sex couples, and\n\nsame-sex couples can raise children as well as opposite-sex couples. They\n\nalso submitted evidence to show that most scientific research has repudiated\n\nthe commonly assumed notion that children need opposite-sex parents or\n\nbiological parents to grow into well-adjusted adults.           Many leading\n\norganizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American\n\nPsychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National\n\nAssociation of Social Workers, and the Child Welfare League of America,\n\nweighed the available research and supported the conclusion that gay and\n\nlesbian parents are as effective as heterosexual parents in raising children.\n\f                                           11\n\n\nFor example, the official policy of the American Psychological Association\n\ndeclares, “There is no scientific evidence that parenting effectiveness is\n\nrelated to parental sexual orientation: Lesbian and gay parents are as likely\n\nas heterosexual parents to provide supportive and healthy environments for\n\nchildren.”3    Almost every professional group that has studied the issue\n\nindicates children are not harmed when raised by same-sex couples, but to\n\nthe contrary, benefit from them. In Iowa, agencies that license foster parents\n\nhave found same-sex couples to be good and acceptable parents.                       It is\n\nestimated that more than 5800 same-sex couples live throughout Iowa, and\n\nover one-third of these couples are raising children.\n\n       The district court concluded the statute was unconstitutional under\n\nthe due process and equal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution and\n\ngranted summary judgment to the plaintiffs. It initially ordered the county\n\nrecorder to begin processing marriage licenses for same-sex couples, but\n\nstayed the order during the pendency of an appeal.\n\n       II.

Constitutional Separation of Powers.\n\n      We approach the resolution of this case with a keen and respectful\n\nunderstanding of our Iowa Constitution and the vital roles of the three\n\nbranches of government, as well as the role of the people. It is important for\n\nthese roles to be identified and expressed from time to time when individuals\n\nseek recognition of rights, if only to serve as a reminder of the process of\n\ngoverning that has served us so well as a state for over 150 years.\n\n      The Iowa Constitution is the cornerstone of governing in Iowa. Like\n\nthe United States Constitution, the Iowa Constitution creates a remarkable\n\nblueprint for government. It establishes three separate, but equal, branches\n\nof government and delineates the limited roles and powers of each branch.\n\nSee Iowa Const. art. III, § 1 (“The powers of the government of Iowa shall be\n\ndivided into three separate departments—the legislative, the executive, and\n\nthe judicial:   and no person charged with the exercise of powers properly\n\nbelonging to one of these departments shall exercise any function\n\nappertaining to either of the others, except in cases hereinafter expressly\n\ndirected or permitted.”). Among other basic principles essential to our form\n\nof government, the constitution defines certain individual rights upon which\n\nthe government may not infringe. See Iowa Const. art. I (“Bill of Rights”).\n\nEqual protection of the law is one of the guaranteed rights. See Iowa Const.\n\nart. I, § 6.    All these rights and principles are declared and undeniably\n\f                                      13\n\n\naccepted as the supreme law of this state, against which no contrary law can\n\nstand. See Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1 (“This constitution shall be the supreme\n\nlaw of the state, and any law inconsistent therewith, shall be void.”).\n\n      This case, as with most other civil rights actions before it, implicates\n\nthese broad constitutional principles of governing.        The legislature, in\n\ncarrying out its constitutional role to make public policy decisions, enacted a\n\nlaw that effectively excludes gay and lesbian people from the institution of\n\ncivil marriage. The executive branch of government, in carrying out its role\n\nto execute the law, enforced this statute through a county official who\n\nrefused to issue marriage licenses to six same-sex couples. These Iowans,\n\nbelieving that the law is inconsistent with certain constitutional mandates,\n\nexercised their constitutional right to petition the courts for redress of their\n\ngrievance.   This court, consistent with its role to interpret the law and\n\nresolve disputes, now has the responsibility to determine if the law enacted\n\nby the legislative branch and enforced by the executive branch violates the\n\nIowa Constitution.\n\n      A statute inconsistent with the Iowa Constitution must be declared\n\nvoid, even though it may be supported by strong and deep-seated traditional\n\nbeliefs and popular opinion.    Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1 (providing any law\n\ninconsistent with the constitution is void). As Chief Justice John Marshall\n\nwrote over two centuries ago, “It is a proposition too plain to be contested,\n\nthat the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it . . . .”\n\nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"84759\"><a href=\"/opinion/84759/marbury-v-madison/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (1803).\n\n      It is also well established that courts must, under all circumstances,\n\nprotect the supremacy of the constitution as a means of protecting our\n\nrepublican form of government and our freedoms.           As was observed by\n\nJustice Robert H. Jackson decades ago in reference to the United States\n\f                                           14\n\n\nConstitution, the very purpose of limiting the power of the elected branches\n\nof government by constitutional provisions like the Equal Protection Clause\n\nis “to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy,\n\nto place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish\n\nthem as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” W.

The idea that courts, free from the political\n\ninfluences in the other two branches of government, are better suited to\n\nprotect individual rights was recognized at the time our Iowa Constitution\n\nwas formed. See Koehler v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640–41\n\n(1883) (Beck, J., dissenting) (“Judges ought not to be partisans, and be\n\ninfluenced by partisan control. Their duty is to interpret and apply the law,\n\nto the end that the liberty, and the rights and property, of the people may be\n\nsecured.”); 1 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention; of the State of\n\nIowa 453 (W.

We look backwards, not because citizens’ rights are\n\nconstrained    to     those   previously   recognized,   but   because   historical\n\f                                       15\n\n\nconstitutional principles provide the framework to define our future as we\n\nconfront the challenges of today.\n\n      Our responsibility, however, is to protect constitutional rights of\n\nindividuals from legislative enactments that have denied those rights, even\n\nwhen the rights have not yet been broadly accepted, were at one time\n\nunimagined, or challenge a deeply ingrained practice or law viewed to be\n\nimpervious to the passage of time.      The framers of the Iowa Constitution\n\nknew, as did the drafters of the United States Constitution, that “times can\n\nblind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once\n\nthought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,” and as our\n\nconstitution “endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles\n\nin their own search for greater freedom” and equality.

In\n\ncarrying out this fundamental and vital role, “we must never forget that it is\n\na constitution we are expounding.” M’Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.)\n\n316, 407, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85272\"><a href=\"/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

See\n\nIowa Const. art. I, § 2 (“All political power is inherent in the people.\n\f                                      16\n\n\nGovernment is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the\n\npeople, and they have the right, at all times, to alter or reform the same,\n\nwhenever the public good may require it.”).      While the constitution is the\n\nsupreme law and cannot be altered by the enactment of an ordinary statute,\n\nthe power of the constitution flows from the people, and the people of Iowa\n\nretain the ultimate power to shape it over time.        See Iowa Const. art. X\n\n(“Amendments to the Constitution”).\n\n      IV. Equal Protection.\n\n      A. Background Principles.       The primary constitutional principle at\n\nthe heart of this case is the doctrine of equal protection.     The concept of\n\nequal protection is deeply rooted in our national and state history, but that\n\nhistory reveals this concept is often expressed far more easily than it is\n\npracticed. For sure, our nation has struggled to achieve a broad national\n\nconsensus on equal protection of the laws when it has been forced to apply\n\nthat principle to some of the institutions, traditions, and norms woven into\n\nthe fabric of our society.    This observation is important today because it\n\nreveals equal protection can only be defined by the standards of each\n\ngeneration. See Cass R. Sunstein, Sexual Orientation and the Constitution: A\n\nNote on the Relationship Between Due Process and Equal Protection, 55\n\nU. Chi. L. Rev. 1161, 1163 (1988) (“[T]he Equal Protection Clause looks\n\nforward, serving to invalidate practices that were widespread at the time of\n\nits ratification and that were expected to endure.”).\n\n      The process of defining equal protection, as shown by our history as\n\ncaptured and told in court decisions, begins by classifying people into\n\ngroups.    A classification persists until a new understanding of equal\n\nprotection is achieved.      The point in time when the standard of equal\n\nprotection finally takes a new form is a product of the conviction of one, or\n\f                                      17\n\n\nmany, individuals that a particular grouping results in inequality and the\n\nability of the judicial system to perform its constitutional role free from the\n\ninfluences that tend to make society’s understanding of equal protection\n\nresistant to change. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes poignantly said, “It is\n\nrevolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid\n\ndown in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon\n\nwhich it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply\n\npersists from blind imitation of the past.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, Justice,\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, The Path of the Law, address\n\ndedicating new hall at Boston University School of Law (January 8, 1897), in\n\n10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897). This concept is evident in our past cases.\n\n      In the first reported case of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Iowa,\n\nIn re Ralph, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Morris</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 1839), we refused to treat a human being as\n\nproperty to enforce a contract for slavery and held our laws must extend\n\nequal protection to persons of all races and conditions. 1 Morris at 9. This\n\ndecision was seventeen years before the United States Supreme Court\n\ninfamously decided Dred Scott v.

In each of those instances, our state approached a fork in the\n\nroad toward fulfillment of our constitution’s ideals and reaffirmed the\n\n“absolute equality of all” persons before the law as “the very foundation\n\nprinciple of our government.”4 See Coger, 37 Iowa at 153.\n\n       So, today, this court again faces an important issue that hinges on our\n\ndefinition of equal protection.           This issue comes to us with the same\n\nimportance as our landmark cases of the past.                    The same-sex-marriage\n\ndebate waged in this case is part of a strong national dialogue5 centered on a\n\nfundamental, deep-seated, traditional institution that has excluded, by state\n\naction, a particular class of Iowans. This class of people asks a simple and\n\ndirect question: How can a state premised on the constitutional principle of\n\nequal protection justify exclusion of a class of Iowans from civil marriage?\n\n       4The  cases we have cited are not meant to imply this court has been at the forefront\nin recognizing civil rights in all areas and at all times. See, e.g., In re Carragher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span>\n<span class=\"page\">225</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229–30, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354 (1910) (upholding a law that effectively denied women\npharmacists the right to sell alcohol, stating “discrimination between the sexes is neither\narbitrary nor capricious, and the fact that in many instances individuals of one sex are in\ngeneral better fitted than those of the other sex for a given occupation or business is one of\nsuch common knowledge and observation that the Legislature may properly recognize it in\nenacting regulations therefor”). These cases do, however, reflect this court has, for the most\npart, been at the forefront in recognizing individuals’ civil rights. The path we have taken as\na state has not been by accident, but has been navigated with the compass of equality firmly\nin hand, constructed with a pointer balanced carefully on the pivot of equal protection.\n       5One   commentator has found that, since the same-sex-marriage debate started,\ntwenty-seven states have passed constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage,\nand seventeen of those state amendments also ban other official forms of same-sex\nrelationships, such as civil unions.

Legal Tests to Gauge Equal Protection.

I, § 1 (“All men\n\nand women are, by nature, free and equal . . . .”); id. art. I, § 2 (recognizing\n\n“[a]ll political power is inherent in the people” and “[g]overnment is instituted\n\nfor the protection, security, and benefit of the people”).

In this process, some classifications and barriers are inevitable. As a\n\nresult, courts pay deference to legislative decisions when called upon to\n\ndetermine whether the Iowa Constitution’s mandate of equality has been\n\nviolated by legislative action. More specifically, when evaluating challenges\n\nbased on the equal protection clause, our deference to legislative policy-\n\nmaking is primarily manifested in the level of scrutiny we apply to review\n\nlegislative action.\n\n      In most cases, we apply a very deferential standard known as the\n\n“rational basis test.” Id.

Most often, judicial decision-making is\n\npredicated solely on a finding of facts relating to the parties and their\n\nparticular circumstances. Id. These facts are referred to as “adjudicative”\n\nfacts, see id., and the resolution of a dispute over these facts is done within\n\nthe framework of a set of rules to determine the admissibility of evidence\n\ntending to prove such facts. See generally Iowa Rs. Evid. At times, however,\n\njudicial decision-making involves crafting rules of law based on social,\n\neconomic, political, or scientific facts. See 2 John W. Strong, McCormick on\n\nEvidence § 328, at 369 (5th ed. 1999) [hereinafter McCormick on Evidence].\n\nThese facts have been denominated as “legislative” facts and become relevant\n\nto judicial decision-making when courts are required to decide the\n\nconstitutionality of a statute, among other occasions.

Importantly, constitutional facts are\n\nnot subject to the rules of evidence when presented by a party in the form of\n\nwitness testimony. Conceptually, testimony relating to constitutional facts is\n\nonly presented as authority for the legal decision the court is required to\n\nmake, and it would be inconsistent to apply formal rules of evidence to facts\n\nin the form of testimony that a court can independently obtain and consider\n\nin deciding the case.\n\n      Nonetheless,      courts   consider   the   “actual    truth-content”    of\n\nconstitutional facts.

Such\n\na threshold analysis would hollow out the constitution’s promise of equal\n\nprotection.\n\n         Thus, equal protection before the law demands more than the equal\n\napplication of the classifications made by the law.

In other words, to truly ensure equality before the\n\nlaw, the equal protection guarantee requires that laws treat all those who are\n\nsimilarly situated with respect to the purposes of the law alike.

Plaintiffs are in committed and loving relationships,\n\nmany raising families, just like heterosexual couples.      Moreover, official\n\nrecognition of their status provides an institutional basis for defining their\n\nfundamental relational rights and responsibilities, just as it does for\n\nheterosexual couples. Society benefits, for example, from providing same-\n\nsex couples a stable framework within which to raise their children and the\n\npower to make health care and end-of-life decisions for loved ones, just as it\n\ndoes when that framework is provided for opposite-sex couples.\n\n      In short, for purposes of Iowa’s marriage laws, which are designed to\n\nbring a sense of order to the legal relationships of committed couples and\n\ntheir families in myriad ways, plaintiffs are similarly situated in every\n\nimportant respect, but for their sexual orientation. As indicated above, this\n\ndistinction cannot defeat the application of equal protection analysis through\n\f                                             29\n\n\nthe application of the similarly situated concept because, under this circular\n\napproach, all distinctions would evade equal protection review. Therefore,\n\nwith respect to the government’s purpose of “providing an institutional basis\n\nfor defining the fundamental relational rights and responsibilities of\n\npersons,” same–sex couples are similarly situated to opposite–sex couples.9\n\n       E. Classification        Undertaken        in   Iowa    Code      Section     595.2.\n\nPlaintiffs believe Iowa Code section 595.2 classifies on the bases of gender\n\nand sexual orientation. The County argues the same-sex marriage ban does\n\nnot discriminate on either basis.            The district court held section 595.2\n\nclassifies according to gender. As we will explain, we believe the ban on civil\n\nmarriages between two people of the same sex classifies on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation.\n\n\n\n\n       9While   we have applied the threshold analysis in previous cases, we have, at times,\ndirectly or indirectly infused that analysis with principles traditionally applied in the\ncomplete equal protection analysis. See, e.g., Hennings, 744 N.W.2d at 338–39 (disposing of\nan equal protection claim with a threshold similarly situated analysis, but within that\nthreshold analysis evaluating the relationship of the state’s interest and the classification\nmade by the statute); see also Timberland Partners XXI, LLP, 757 N.W.2d at 176–77\n(implicitly considering relationship between classifications and taxing interests of the state\nby focusing on distinctions in the use of commercial and residential property); Grovijohn,\n643 N.W.2d at 204 (using threshold test to find the notice provisions of the dramshop\nstatute treat all dramshop plaintiffs the same, but determining plaintiff failed to articulate\nhow the adoption of the comparative fault statute altered prior case law finding the notice\nrequirement did not violate equal protection). This approach is almost inevitable for the test\nto have any real value as an analytical tool to resolve equal protection claims.\nConsequently, we question the usefulness of the threshold test and express caution in the\nfuture use of the threshold analysis. See, e.g., Angie Baker, Note, Leapfrogging Over Equal\nProtection Analysis: The Eighth Circuit Sanctions Separate and Unequal Prison Facilities for\nMales and Females in Klinger v. Department of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

A Proposed Analysis for\nEqual Protection Claims of Gender Discrimination in Educational and Vocational Programming\nat Women’s Prisons, 5 Temple Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 1, 22–23 (1995) (same). Because the\nplaintiffs here satisfy the threshold test we have followed in the past, the outcome in this\ncase would not be affected by abandoning that test now. Therefore, we leave to future\nparties the task of arguing the applicability of the threshold similarly situated analysis in\nfuture cases.\n\f                                      30\n\n\n      The County initially points out that section 595.2 does not explicitly\n\nrefer to “sexual orientation” and does not inquire into whether either\n\nmember of a proposed civil marriage is sexually attracted to the other.\n\nConsequently, it seizes on these observations to support its claim that the\n\nstatute does not establish a classification on the basis of sexual orientation\n\nbecause the same-sex civil marriage ban does not grant or withhold the\n\nbenefits flowing from the statute based on sexual preference. Instead, the\n\nCounty argues, section 595.2 only incidentally impacts disparately upon gay\n\nand lesbian people.\n\n      The County’s position reveals the importance of accurately and\n\nprecisely defining the classification in analyzing all equal protection\n\nchallenges.   The manner in which a classification is defined impacts the\n\nutility of an equal protection analysis as a means of revealing discrimination.\n\nTherefore, it is critical that a court reviewing the statute identify the true\n\nnature of the classification.\n\n      It is true the marriage statute does not expressly prohibit gay and\n\nlesbian persons from marrying; it does, however, require that if they marry,\n\nit must be to someone of the opposite sex. Viewed in the complete context of\n\nmarriage, including intimacy, civil marriage with a person of the opposite sex\n\nis as unappealing to a gay or lesbian person as civil marriage with a person\n\nof the same sex is to a heterosexual.      Thus, the right of a gay or lesbian\n\nperson under the marriage statute to enter into a civil marriage only with a\n\nperson of the opposite sex is no right at all.     Under such a law, gay or\n\nlesbian individuals cannot simultaneously fulfill their deeply felt need for a\n\ncommitted personal relationship, as influenced by their sexual orientation,\n\nand gain the civil status and attendant benefits granted by the statute.\n\nInstead, a gay or lesbian person can only gain the same rights under the\n\f                                        31\n\n\nstatute as a heterosexual person by negating the very trait that defines gay\n\nand lesbian people as a class—their sexual orientation.           In re Marriage\n\nCases, 183 P.3d at 441. The benefit denied by the marriage statute—the\n\nstatus of civil marriage for same-sex couples—is so “closely correlated with\n\nbeing homosexual” as to make it apparent the law is targeted at gay and\n\nlesbian people as a class.       See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 583, 123 S. Ct. at\n\n2486,    156    L.

Id.\n\n       Instead of adopting a rigid formula to determine whether certain\n\nlegislative classifications warrant more demanding constitutional analysis,\n\nthe Supreme Court has looked to four factors.11 Conaway, 932 A.2d at 606\n\n       11Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Supreme Court in Plyler suggests the significance\nof each of the four factors. Although Plyler does not formulate a specific test, nor even\ndiscuss “factors” per se, the case touches upon each of the four traditional factors:\n       Several formulations might explain our treatment of certain classifications as\n       “suspect.” Some classifications are more likely than others to reflect deep-\n\f                                               34\n\n\n(discussing factors examined by Supreme Court in considering use of\n\nheightened scrutiny). The Supreme Court has considered: (1) the history of\n\ninvidious discrimination against the class burdened by the legislation;12 (2)\n\nwhether the characteristics that distinguish the class indicate a typical class\n\nmember’s ability to contribute to society;13 (3) whether the distinguishing\n\n\n\n       seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of some\n       legitimate objective. Legislation predicated on such prejudice is easily\n       recognized as incompatible with the constitutional understanding that each\n       person is to be judged individually and is entitled to equal justice under the\n       law. Classifications treated as suspect tend to be irrelevant to any proper\n       legislative goal. Finally, certain groups, indeed largely the same groups, have\n       historically been “relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to\n       command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”\n       The experience of our Nation has shown that prejudice may manifest itself in\n       the treatment of some groups.

Determination of Appropriate Level of Scrutiny. Guided by the\n\nestablished framework, we next consider each of the four traditional factors\n\nand assess how each bears on the question of whether the constitution\n\ndemands a more searching scrutiny be applied to the sexual-orientation-\n\nbased classification in Iowa’s marriage statute.\n\n      1. History of discrimination against gay and lesbian people. The first\n\nconsideration is whether gay and lesbian people have suffered a history of\n\npurposeful unequal treatment because of their sexual orientation.         The\n\nCounty does not, and could not in good faith, dispute the historical reality\n\nthat gay and lesbian people as a group have long been the victim of\n\npurposeful and invidious discrimination because of their sexual orientation.\n\nThe long and painful history of discrimination against gay and lesbian\n\npersons is epitomized by the criminalization of homosexual conduct in many\n\nparts of this country until very recently. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578–79,\n\n123 S. Ct. 2483–84, 156 L. Ed. 2d at 520 (invalidating criminalization of\n\nhomosexual sodomy in 2003).       Additionally, only a few years ago persons\n\nidentified as homosexual were dismissed from military service regardless of\n\npast dedication and demonstrated valor. Public employees identified as gay\n\nor lesbian have been thought to pose security risks due to a perceived risk of\n\nextortion resulting from a threat of public exposure.     School-yard bullies\n\f                                               38\n\n\nhave psychologically ground children with apparently gay or lesbian sexual\n\norientation in the cruel mortar and pestle of school-yard prejudice. At the\n\nsame time, lesbian and gay people continue to be frequent victims of hate\n\ncrimes.     See Criminal Justice Information Servs. Div., FBI, Hate Crime\n\nStatistics 2007, http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/victims.htm (according to\n\nFBI-collected data, the only hate crimes occurring more frequently than\n\nsexual-orientation-motivated hate crimes are crimes based on race or\n\nreligious bias).\n\n       The Iowa General Assembly has recognized the need to address\n\nsexual-orientation-based discrimination by including sexual orientation as a\n\ncharacteristic protected in the Iowa Civil Rights Act, by defining hate crimes\n\nto include certain offenses committed because of the victim’s sexual\n\norientation, and by prohibiting “harassing or bullying” behavior in schools\n\nbased on sexual orientation. See Iowa Code §§ 216.2–.18A (Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct)    (sexual-orientation-based           discrimination);       id.    § 280.28       (school\n\nharassment and bullying); id. § 729A.2 (hate crimes committed because of\n\nthe victim’s sexual orientation). These statutory enactments demonstrate a\n\nlegislative recognition of the need to remedy historical sexual-orientation-\n\nbased discrimination.17\n\n       In sum, this history of discrimination suggests any legislative burdens\n\nplaced on lesbian and gay people as a class “are more likely than others to\n\n\n       17Additional    legal authority abounds demonstrating the history of discrimination.\nSee, e.g., In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 442 (finding “sexual orientation is a\ncharacteristic . . . that is associated with a stigma of inferiority and second-class citizenship,\nmanifested by the group’s history of legal and social disabilities); Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 432–\n33 (concluding gay and lesbian people have “been subjected to and stigmatized by a long\nhistory of purposeful and invidious discrimination,” and recounting numerous legal and\nscientific authorities); Dean, 653 A.2d at 344–45 (“Discrimination against homosexuals has\nbeen pervasive in both the public and the private sectors.”); Conaway, 932 A.2d at 609\n(“Homosexual persons have been the object of societal prejudice by private actors as well as\nby the judicial and legislative branches of federal and state governments.”).\n\f                                             39\n\n\nreflect deep-seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of\n\nsome legitimate objective.” Plyler, 457 U.S. at 216 n.14, 102 S. Ct. at 2394\n\nn.14, 72 L. Ed. 2d at 799 n.14. This observation favors an elevated scrutiny\n\nto uncover any such prejudice.\n\n       2. Sexual orientation and the ability to contribute to society. A second\n\nrelevant consideration is whether the characteristic at issue—sexual\n\norientation—is related to the person’s ability to contribute to society.\n\nHeightened scrutiny is applied when the classification bears no relationship\n\nto a person’s ability to contribute to society.             The existence of this factor\n\nindicates the classification is likely based on irrelevant stereotypes and\n\nprejudice.     Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 453.             A classification unrelated to a\n\nperson’s ability to perform or contribute to society typically reflects\n\n“prejudice and antipathy—a view that those in the burdened class are not as\n\nworthy or deserving as others” or “reflect[s] outmoded notions of the relative\n\ncapabilities of persons with the characteristic.”              Cleburne Living Ctr., 473\n\nU.S. at 440–41, 105 S. Ct. at 3254–56, 87 L. Ed. 2d at 320–21.\n\n       Not surprisingly, none of the same-sex marriage decisions from other\n\nstate courts around the nation have found a person’s sexual orientation to\n\nbe indicative of the person’s general ability to contribute to society.18 See,\n\n       18The   County references plaintiffs’ inability to procreate “naturally,” presumably\npointing out each couple’s inability to procreate without assistance. Plaintiffs’ inability to\ncontribute children to society by procreation through sexual intercourse with each other\ndoes not dictate the outcome of our consideration under this factor. The inquiry into gay\nand lesbian people’s ability to contribute to society is a general one, designed to signal\nwhether such classifications routinely risk elevating stereotype over ability. A person’s\nability to procreate is merely one of many ways in which the person can contribute to\nsociety. While the narrower consideration of plaintiffs’ procreative abilities may be relevant\nto whether section 595.2 ultimately passes judicial scrutiny, consideration of those abilities\nis less helpful in determining which level of scrutiny to apply. That is, the inability of gay\nand lesbian partners to contribute by procreation through sexual intercourse with each\nother does not indicate whether legislative classifications based on sexual preference—which\ncan conceivably occur in any legislative subject matter area—will generally be based on\n“stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities.” Murgia, 427 U.S. at 313,\n96 S.

More importantly, the Iowa legislature has recently declared as\n\nthe public policy of this state that sexual orientation is not relevant to a\n\nperson’s ability to contribute to a number of societal institutions other than\n\ncivil marriage.

Likewise, numerous state\nadministrative regulations indicate sexual orientation is not relevant to a person’s ability to\ncontribute to society. See Iowa Admin.

Rather, we merely highlight the reality that chapter 216\n\nand    numerous       other    statutes     and    regulations      demonstrate       sexual\n\norientation is broadly recognized in Iowa to be irrelevant to a person’s ability\n\nto contribute to society.20        Those statutes and regulations reflect at least\n\nsome measure of legislative and executive awareness that discrimination\n\nbased on sexual orientation is often predicated on prejudice and stereotype\n\nand further express a desire to remove sexual orientation as an obstacle to\n\nthe ability of gay and lesbian people to achieve their full potential. Therefore,\n\nwe must scrutinize more closely those classifications that suggest a law may\n\nbe based on prejudice and stereotype because laws of that nature are\n\n“incompatible with the constitutional understanding that each person is to\n\nbe judged individually and is entitled to equal justice under the law.” Plyler,\n\n457 U.S. at 217 n.14, 102 S. Ct. at 2394 n.14, 72 L. Ed. 2d at 799 n.14.\n\nThus, although we do not interpret chapter 216 to allow same-sex marriage,\n\nwe rely on the legislative judgment underlying chapter 216 to determine the\n\nappropriate level of scrutiny when sexual orientation is the basis for a\n\nstatutory classification. Based on Iowa statutes and regulations, it is clear\n\nsexual orientation is no longer viewed in Iowa as an impediment to the\n\nability of a person to contribute to society.\n\n       3.

The permanency of the barrier also depends on the\n\nability of the individual to change the characteristic responsible for the\n\ndiscrimination.   This aspect of immutability may separate truly victimized\n\nindividuals from those who have invited discrimination by changing\n\nthemselves so as to be identified with the group.      As implied by Justice\n\nFerren, in dissent, in Dean:\n\n             The degree to which an individual controls, or cannot\n      avoid, the acquisition of the defining trait, and the relative ease\n      or difficulty with which a trait can be changed, are relevant to\n      whether a classification is “suspect” or “quasi-suspect” because\n      this inquiry is one way of asking whether someone, rather than\n      being victimized, has voluntarily joined a persecuted group and\n      thereby invited the discrimination.\n\n653 A.2d at 346 (Ferren, J., dissenting).\n\n      Importantly, this background reveals courts need not definitively\n\nresolve the nature-versus-nurture debate currently raging over the origin of\n\nsexual orientation in order to decide plaintiffs’ equal protection claims. The\n\nconstitutional relevance of the immutability factor is not reserved to those\n\ninstances in which the trait defining the burdened class is absolutely\n\f                                           44\n\n\nimpossible to change.

That is, we agree with those courts that have held the\n\nimmutability “prong of the suspectness inquiry surely is satisfied when . . .\n\nthe identifying trait is ‘so central to a person’s identity that it would be\n\nabhorrent for government to penalize a person for refusing to change [it].’ ”\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 438 (quoting Watkins v.

Political powerlessness of lesbian and gay people. As observed, the\n\npolitical power of the burdened class has been referenced repeatedly in\n\nSupreme Court cases determining the level of scrutiny to be applied to a\n\ngiven piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the Court has never defined what it\n\nmeans to be politically powerless for purposes of this analysis, nor has it\n\nquantified a maximum amount of political power a group may enjoy while\n\nstill receiving the protection from unfair discrimination accompanying\n\nheightened scrutiny. The County points to the numerous legal protections\n\ngay and lesbian people have secured against discrimination, and the County\n\nargues those protections demonstrate gay and lesbian people are not a\n\npolitically powerless class. The County’s argument implies gay and lesbian\n\npeople must be characterized by a complete, or nearly complete, lack of\n\npolitical power before courts should subject sexual-orientation-based\n\nlegislative burdens to a heightened scrutiny.\n\n         Notwithstanding the lack of a mathematical equation to guide the\n\nanalysis of this factor, a number of helpful general principles related to the\n\npolitical power of suspect classes can be culled from the Supreme Court’s\n\ncases.     First, these cases show absolute political powerlessness is not\n\nnecessary to subject legislative burdens on a certain class to heightened\n\nscrutiny. For example, females enjoyed at least some measure of political\n\npower when the Supreme Court first heightened its scrutiny of gender\n\nclassifications. See Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685–88 & n.17, 93 S. Ct. at 1769–\n\n72 & n.17, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 591–92 & n.17 (Brennan, J., plurality opinion)\n\n(subjecting gender classifications to heightened scrutiny after observing Civil\n\f                                           46\n\n\nRights Act of 1964 and Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibited sex discrimination\n\nand noting “the position of women in America [had] improved markedly” by\n\n1973 such that “women [did] not constitute a small and powerless\n\nminority”).\n\n       Second, Supreme Court jurisprudence establishes that a group’s\n\ncurrent political powerlessness is not a prerequisite to enhanced judicial\n\nprotection. “[I]f a group’s current political powerlessness [was] a prerequisite\n\nto a characteristic’s being considered a constitutionally suspect basis for\n\ndifferential treatment, it would be impossible to justify the numerous\n\ndecisions that continue to treat sex, race, and religion as suspect\n\nclassifications.” In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 443.

Ed. 2d at 751–52 (applying intermediate scrutiny).\n\n       While a more in-depth discussion of the history of the political-power\n\nfactor is possible, see Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 439–44, we are satisfied, for the\n\npurpose of analyzing the Iowa Constitution, the political powerlessness\n\nfactor of the level-of-scrutiny inquiry does not require a showing of absolute\n\npolitical powerlessness.     Rather, the touchstone of the analysis should be\n\n“whether the group lacks sufficient political strength to bring a prompt end\n\n\n\n\n        21By one measure—occupation of public office—the political power of racial\n\nminorities is unbounded in this country today.

Although\n\na small number of state legislatures have approved civil unions for gay and\n\nlesbian people without judicial intervention, no legislature has secured the\n\nright to civil marriage for gay and lesbian people without court order.22 The\n\nmyriad statutes and regulatory protections against discrimination based on\n\nsexual    orientation     in    such   areas      as     employment,    housing,     public\n\naccommodations, and education have not only been absent in the area of\n\nmarriage, but legislative bodies have taken affirmative steps to shore up the\n\nconcept of traditional marriage by specifically excluding gays and lesbians.\n\nLike Iowa, over forty other states have passed statutes or constitutional\n\namendments to ban same-sex marriages.

Rev. 505, 516–17 & n.46 (2008) (reviewing status of state laws relating to legal\nrecognition of same-sex relationships and noting only the California legislature has (twice)\npassed a law allowing same-sex civil marriage (which was twice vetoed by that state’s\ngovernor)).\n\f                                      48\n\n\narena, the right to civil marriage is a notable exception to this trend.\n\nConsequently, the specific right sought in this case has largely lacked any\n\nextensive political support and has actually experienced an affirmative\n\nbacklash.\n\n      We are convinced gay and lesbian people are not so politically powerful\n\nas to overcome the unfair and severe prejudice that history suggests\n\nproduces discrimination based on sexual orientation.        Gays and lesbians\n\ncertainly possess no more political power than women enjoyed four decades\n\nago when the Supreme Court began subjecting gender-based legislation to\n\ncloser scrutiny.     Additionally, gay and lesbian people are, as a class,\n\ncurrently no more powerful than women or members of some racial\n\nminorities. These facts demonstrate, at the least, the political-power factor\n\ndoes not weigh against heightened judicial scrutiny of sexual-orientation-\n\nbased legislation.\n\n      5. Classifications based on sexual orientation demand closer scrutiny.\n\nIn summarizing the rationale supporting heightened scrutiny of legislation\n\nclassifying on the basis of sexual orientation, it would be difficult to improve\n\nupon the words of the Supreme Court of Connecticut:\n\n      Gay persons have been subjected to and stigmatized by a long\n      history of purposeful and invidious discrimination that\n      continues to manifest itself in society. The characteristic that\n      defines the members of this group—attraction to persons of the\n      same sex—bears no logical relationship to their ability to\n      perform in society, either in familial relations or otherwise as\n      productive citizens. Because sexual orientation is such an\n      essential component of personhood, even if there is some\n      possibility that a person’s sexual preference can be altered, it\n      would be wholly unacceptable for the state to require anyone to\n      do so. Gay persons also represent a distinct minority of the\n      population. It is true, of course, that gay persons recently have\n      made significant advances in obtaining equal treatment under\n      the law. Nonetheless, we conclude that, as a minority group\n      that continues to suffer the enduring effects of centuries of\n      legally sanctioned discrimination, laws singling them out for\n      disparate treatment are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny\n\f                                           49\n\n       to ensure that those laws are not the product of such historical\n       prejudice and stereotyping.\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 432. But see Conaway, 932 A.2d at 609–14 (holding\n\nsexual-orientation-based legislation is not entitled to heightened scrutiny\n\nbecause lesbian and gay people are not politically powerless); Andersen, 138\n\nP.3d at 974 (determining plaintiffs failed to satisfy burden to prove\n\nhomosexuality is not an immutable trait and consequently holding sexual-\n\norientation-based distinctions do not demand closer judicial scrutiny). We\n\nagree with the observations of the Connecticut Supreme Court. The factors\n\nestablished to guide our determination of the level of scrutiny to utilize in\n\nour examination of the equal protection claim in this case all point to an\n\nelevated level of scrutiny. Accordingly, we hold that legislative classifications\n\nbased on sexual orientation must be examined under a heightened level of\n\nscrutiny under the Iowa Constitution.\n\n       H. Application of Heightened Scrutiny.                 Plaintiffs argue sexual-\n\norientation-based statutes should be subject to the most searching scrutiny.\nThe County asserts Iowa’s marriage statute, section 595.2, may be reviewed,\n\nat most, according to an intermediate level of scrutiny. Because we conclude\n\nIowa’s same-sex marriage statute cannot withstand intermediate scrutiny,\nwe need not decide whether classifications based on sexual orientation are\n\nsubject to a higher level of scrutiny. Thus, we turn to a discussion of the\n\nintermediate scrutiny standard.23\n\n       23Plaintiffsand some amici urge us to abandon the traditional tiered analysis. This\nview is supported by commentators, at least one of which points out no new suspect or\nquasi-suspect class has been identified since the 1970s and argues the notion of suspect\nclasses is a dead letter in federal constitutional law. See Evan Gerstman, Same Sex\nMarriage & the Constitution 61–63 (2004). The “rigidified” tiered approach has long had its\ndetractors, see, e.g., San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist., 411 U.S. at 98, 93 S.

Statutory classification:        exclusion of gay and lesbian people from\n\ncivil marriage.      To identify the statutory classification, we focus on the\n\n“differential treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought.” Id.\n\nat 532–33, 116 S. Ct. at 2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751 (considering “categorical\n\nexclusion” of women from institution of higher education). Plaintiffs bring\n\nthis lawsuit complaining of their exclusion from the institution of civil\n\n\njurisprudence, we recognize it is sometimes prudent to delay consideration of a new analysis\nto subsequent cases when the change can be more fully explored. See RACI II, 675 N.W.2d\nat 6 (“[I]t is prudent to delay any consideration of whether a different analysis is appropriate\nto a case in which this issue was thoroughly briefed and explored.” (citing In re Det. of\nGarren, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1718890\"><a href=\"/opinion/1718890/in-re-detention-of-garren/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 n.1 (Iowa 2000)). And while plaintiffs have urged us to adopt\na balancing standard, the parties’ application of equal protection principles to the facts of\nthis case has focused on the tiered approach. We also conclude we are able to adequately\nfulfill our “constitutional obligation as the highest court of this sovereign state to determine\nwhether the challenged classification violates Iowa’s constitutional equality provision” by\nusing the traditional approach in this case. Id. at 4. While we once again reaffirm our\nsovereign authority “to employ a different analytical framework under state constitutional\nprovisions,” RACI II, 675 N.W.2d at 5, we decline to adopt a new approach in this case.\n\f                                              51\n\n\nmarriage.        In response, the County offers support for the legislature’s\n\ndecision to statutorily establish heterosexual civil marriage.                   Because the\n\nrelevant focal point is the opportunity sought by the plaintiffs, the issue\n\npresented by this lawsuit is whether the state has “exceedingly persuasive”\n\nreasons for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples, not whether state-\n\nsanctioned, heterosexual marriage is constitutional.                  See id. at 531, 116\n\nS. Ct. at 2274, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751. Thus, the question we must answer is\n\nwhether excluding gay and lesbian people from civil marriage is substantially\n\nrelated to any important governmental objective.\n\n       3. Governmental objectives.           The County has proffered a number of\n\nobjectives supporting the marriage statute. These objectives include support\n\nfor the “traditional” institution of marriage, the optimal procreation and\n\nrearing of children, and financial considerations.24\n\n       The first step in scrutinizing a statutory classification can be to\n\ndetermine whether the objectives purportedly advanced by the classification\n\nare important.        “The burden of justification is demanding and it rests\n\nentirely on the State.” Id. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at 2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751.\n\nWhere we find, or can assume, the proffered governmental interests are\n\nsufficiently weighty to be called “important,” the critical inquiry is whether\n\nthese governmental objectives can fairly be said to be advanced by the\n\nlegislative classification. See, e.g., Fed. Land Bank v. Arnold, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n\n       <span class=\"page\">24Other</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   jurisdictions considering the validity of legislative exclusion of gay and\nlesbian people from civil marriage have considered alternative justifications. See, e.g.,\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 476 (uniformity with laws of other jurisdictions); id. at 518 (Zarella, J.,\ndissenting) (regulation of heterosexual procreation); Hernandez v. Robles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32–\n34 (N.Y. 2006) (Kaye, C.J., dissenting) (moral disapproval, uniformity with other\njurisdictions); Andersen, 138 P.3d at 982 (avoid “the need to resolve the sometimes\nconflicting rights and obligations of the same-sex couple and the necessary third party in\nrelation to a child”). We need not independently analyze these alternative justifications as\nthey are not offered to support the Iowa statute. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, 116 S. Ct. at\n2275, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 751 (“The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or\ninvented post hoc in response to litigation.”).\n\f                                     52\n\n\n153, 156 (Iowa 1988) (“First we must examine the legitimacy of the end to be\n\nachieved; we then scrutinize the means used to achieve that end.”). In this\n\nanalysis, we drill down to analyze the “link between classification and\n\nobjective.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632, 116 S. Ct. at 1627, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 866.\n\n      a. Maintaining traditional marriage.    First, the County argues the\n\nsame-sex marriage ban promotes the “integrity of traditional marriage” by\n\n“maintaining the historical and traditional marriage norm ([as] one between\n\na man and a woman).” This argument is straightforward and has superficial\n\nappeal. A specific tradition sought to be maintained cannot be an important\n\ngovernmental objective for equal protection purposes, however, when the\n\ntradition is nothing more than the historical classification currently\n\nexpressed in the statute being challenged. When a certain tradition is used\n\nas both the governmental objective and the classification to further that\n\nobjective, the equal protection analysis is transformed into the circular\n\nquestion of whether the classification accomplishes the governmental\n\nobjective, which objective is to maintain the classification. In other words,\n\nthe equal protection clause is converted into a “ ‘barren form of words’ ”\n\nwhen “ ‘discrimination . . . is made an end in itself.’ ” Tussman & tenBroek,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 357 (quoting Truax v. Raich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98542\"><a href=\"/opinion/98542/truax-v-raich/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98542\"><a href=\"/opinion/98542/truax-v-raich/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135 (1915)).\n\n      This precise situation is presented by the County’s claim that the\n\nstatute in this case exists to preserve the traditional understanding of\n\nmarriage. The governmental objective identified by the County—to maintain\n\nthe traditional understanding of marriage—is simply another way of saying\n\nthe governmental objective is to limit civil marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\nOpposite-sex marriage, however, is the classification made under the\n\nstatute, and this classification must comply with our principles of equal\n\f                                       53\n\n\nprotection. Thus, the use of traditional marriage as both the governmental\n\nobjective and the classification of the statute transforms the equal protection\n\nanalysis into the question of whether restricting marriage to opposite-sex\n\ncouples accomplishes the governmental objective of maintaining opposite-sex\n\nmarriage.\n\n        This approach is, of course, an empty analysis.          It permits a\n\nclassification to be maintained “ ‘for its own sake.’ ” Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at\n\n478 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 635, 116 S. Ct. at 1629, 134 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n868).    Moreover, it can allow discrimination to become acceptable as\n\ntradition and helps to explain how discrimination can exist for such a long\n\ntime. If a simple showing that discrimination is traditional satisfies equal\n\nprotection, previous successful equal protection challenges of invidious\n\nracial and gender classifications would have failed.     Consequently, equal\n\nprotection demands that “ ‘the classification ([that is], the exclusion of gay\n\n[persons] from civil marriage) must advance a state interest that is separate\n\nfrom the classification itself.’ ” Id. (quoting Hernandez v. Robles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (N.Y. 2006) (Kaye, C.J., dissenting)); see also Romer, 517 U.S. at 635,\n\n116 S. Ct. at 1629, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 868 (rejecting “classification of persons\n\nundertaken for its own sake”).\n\n        “[W]hen tradition is offered to justify preserving a statutory scheme\n\nthat has been challenged on equal protection grounds, we must determine\n\nwhether the reasons underlying that tradition are sufficient to satisfy\n\nconstitutional requirements.”     Kerrigan, 957 A.2d at 478–79 (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, we must analyze the legislature’s objective in maintaining the\n\ntraditional classification being challenged.\n\n        The reasons underlying traditional marriage may include the other\n\nobjectives asserted by the County, objectives we will separately address in\n\f                                             54\n\n\nthis decision. However, some underlying reason other than the preservation\n\nof tradition must be identified.25 Because the County offers no particular\n\ngovernmental reason underlying the tradition of limiting civil marriage to\n\nheterosexual couples, we press forward to consider other plausible reasons\n\nfor the legislative classification.\n\n       b. Promotion of optimal environment to raise children.                        Another\n\ngovernmental objective proffered by the County is the promotion of “child\n\nrearing by a father and a mother in a marital relationship which social\n\nscientists say with confidence is the optimal milieu for child rearing.” This\n\nobjective implicates the broader governmental interest to promote the best\n\ninterests of children.       The “best interests of children” is, undeniably, an\n\nimportant governmental objective.             Yet, we first examine the underlying\n\npremise proffered by the County that the optimal environment for children is\n\nto be raised within a marriage of both a mother and a father.\n\n       Plaintiffs presented an abundance of evidence and research, confirmed\n\nby our independent research, supporting the proposition that the interests of\n\nchildren are served equally by same-sex parents and opposite-sex parents.\n\nOn the other hand, we acknowledge the existence of reasoned opinions that\n\ndual-gender parenting is the optimal environment for children.                         These\n\nopinions, while thoughtful and sincere, were largely unsupported by reliable\n\nscientific studies.26\n\n       25The   preservation of traditional marriage could only be a legitimate reason for the\nclassification if expanding marriage to include others in its definition would undermine the\ntraditional institution. The County has simply failed to explain how the traditional\ninstitution of civil marriage would suffer if same-sex civil marriage were allowed. There is no\nlegitimate notion that a more inclusive definition of marriage will transform civil marriage\ninto something less than it presently is for heterosexuals. Benjamin G. Ledsham, Note,\nMeans to Legitimate Ends: Same-Sex Marriage through the Lens of Illegitimacy-Based\nDiscrimination, 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 2373, 2388 (2007).\n       26The  research appears to strongly support the conclusion that same-sex couples\nfoster the same wholesome environment as opposite-sex couples and suggests that the\ntraditional notion that children need a mother and a father to be raised into healthy, well-\n\f                                            55\n\n\n       Even assuming there may be a rational basis at this time to believe the\n\nlegislative classification advances a legitimate government interest, this\n\nassumed fact would not be sufficient to survive the equal protection analysis\n\napplicable in this case. In order to ensure this classification based on sexual\n\norientation is not borne of prejudice and stereotype, intermediate scrutiny\n\ndemands a closer relationship between the legislative classification and the\n\npurpose of the classification than mere rationality.                Under intermediate\n\nscrutiny,    the   relationship     between      the   government’s       goal   and     the\n\nclassification employed to further that goal must be “substantial.”                  Clark,\n\n486 U.S. at 461, 108 S. Ct. at 1914, 100 L. Ed. 2d at 472.                     In order to\n\nevaluate that relationship, it is helpful to consider whether the legislation is\n\nover-inclusive or under-inclusive.             See RACI II, 675 N.W.2d at 10\n\n(considering under-inclusion and over-inclusion even in the rational basis\n\ncontext).\n\n       A statute is under-inclusive when the classification made in the\n\nstatute “does not include all who are similarly situated with respect to the\n\npurpose of the law.”        Tussman & tenBroek, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 348.                  An\n\nunder-inclusive statute means all people included in the statutory\n\nclassification have the trait that is relevant to the aim of the statute, but\n\nother people with the trait are not included in the classification. See id. A\n\nstatute is over-inclusive when the classification made in the statute includes\n\nmore persons than those who are similarly situated with respect to the\n\npurpose of the law. See id. at 351. An over-inclusive statute “imposes a\n\nburden upon a wider range of individuals than are included in the class of\n\nthose” with the trait relevant to the aim of the law. Id. As the degree to\n\n\nadjusted adults is based more on stereotype than anything else. In any event, we do not\naddress whether there is a rational basis for the marriage statute, as the sexual-orientation\nclassification made by the statute is subject to a heightened standard of scrutiny.\n\f                                         56\n\n\nwhich a statutory classification is shown to be over-inclusive or under-\n\ninclusive increases, so does the difficulty in demonstrating the classification\n\nsubstantially furthers the legislative goal.\n\n         We begin with the County’s argument that the goal of the same-sex\n\nmarriage ban is to ensure children will be raised only in the optimal milieu.\n\nIn pursuit of this objective, the statutory exclusion of gay and lesbian people\n\nis both under-inclusive and over-inclusive.          The civil marriage statute is\n\nunder-inclusive because it does not exclude from marriage other groups of\n\nparents—such as child abusers, sexual predators, parents neglecting to\n\nprovide child support, and violent felons—that are undeniably less than\n\noptimal parents.       Such under-inclusion tends to demonstrate that the\n\nsexual-orientation-based      classification    is   grounded      in   prejudice   or\n\n“overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or\n\npreferences” of gay and lesbian people, rather than having a substantial\n\nrelationship to some important objective.

Thus, “[t]he legislature may select one phase of one\n\nfield and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others.” Williamson, 348 U.S.\n\nat 489, 75 S. Ct. at 465, 99 L. Ed. at 573.              While a statute does not\n\nautomatically violate equal protection merely by being under-inclusive, the\n\f                                      57\n\n\ndegree of under-inclusion nonetheless indicates the substantiality of the\n\nrelationship between the legislative means and end.\n\n      As applied to this case, it could be argued the same-sex marriage ban\n\nis just one legislative step toward ensuring the optimal environment for\n\nraising children. Under this argument, the governmental objective is slightly\n\nmore modest. It seeks to reduce the number of same-sex parent households,\n\nnudging our state a step closer to providing the asserted optimal milieu for\n\nchildren.   Even evaluated in light of this narrower objective, however, the\n\nban on same-sex marriage is flawed.\n\n      The ban on same-sex marriage is substantially over-inclusive because\n\nnot all same-sex couples choose to raise children. Yet, the marriage statute\n\ndenies civil marriage to all gay and lesbian people in order to discourage the\n\nlimited number of same-sex couples who desire to raise children. In doing\n\nso, the legislature includes a consequential number of “individuals within\n\nthe statute’s purview who are not afflicted with the evil the statute seeks to\n\nremedy.”    Conaway, 932 A.2d at 649 (Raker, J., concurring in part and\n\ndissenting).\n\n      At the same time, the exclusion of gay and lesbian people from\n\nmarriage is under-inclusive, even in relation to the narrower goal of\n\nimproving child rearing by limiting same-sex parenting. Quite obviously, the\n\nstatute does not prohibit same-sex couples from raising children. Same-sex\n\ncouples currently raise children in Iowa, even while being excluded from civil\n\nmarriage, and such couples will undoubtedly continue to do so. Recognition\n\nof this under-inclusion puts in perspective just how minimally the same-sex\n\nmarriage ban actually advances the purported legislative goal.      A law so\n\nsimultaneously over-inclusive and under-inclusive is not substantially\n\nrelated to the government’s objective. In the end, a careful analysis of the\n\f                                            58\n\n\nover- and under-inclusiveness of the statute reveals it is less about using\n\nmarriage to achieve an optimal environment for children and more about\n\nmerely precluding gay and lesbian people from civil marriage.\n\n       If the statute was truly about the best interest of children, some\n\nbenefit to children derived from the ban on same-sex civil marriages would\n\nbe observable.      Yet, the germane analysis does not show how the best\n\ninterests of children of gay and lesbian parents, who are denied an\n\nenvironment supported by the benefits of marriage under the statute, are\n\nserved by the ban.         Likewise, the exclusion of gays and lesbians from\n\nmarriage does not benefit the interests of those children of heterosexual\n\nparents, who are able to enjoy the environment supported by marriage with\n\nor without the inclusion of same-sex couples.\n\n       The ban on same-sex civil marriage can only logically be justified as a\n\nmeans to ensure the asserted optimal environment for raising children if\n\nfewer children will be raised within same-sex relationships27 or more\n\nchildren will be raised in dual-gender marriages. Yet, the same-sex-marriage\n\nban will accomplish these outcomes only when people in same-sex\n\nrelationships choose not to raise children without the benefit of marriage or\n\nwhen children are adopted by dual-gender couples who would have been\n\nadopted by same-sex couples but for the same-sex civil marriage ban. We\n\ndiscern no substantial support for this proposition.               These outcomes, at\n\nbest, are minimally advanced by the classification.                    Consequently, a\n\nclassification that limits civil marriage to opposite-sex couples is simply not\n\nsubstantially related to the objective of promoting the optimal environment\n\n\n       27The  County does not specifically contend the goal of Iowa’s marriage statute is to\ndeter gay and lesbian couples from having children. Such a claim would raise serious due\nprocess concerns. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108489\"><a href=\"/opinion/108489/eisenstadt-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108489\"><a href=\"/opinion/108489/eisenstadt-v-baird/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This conclusion suggests stereotype and prejudice, or\n\nsome other unarticulated reason, could be present to explain the real\n\nobjectives of the statute.\n\n      c. Promotion    of     procreation.        The   County   also    proposes   that\n\ngovernment endorsement of traditional civil marriage will result in more\n\nprocreation. It points out that procreation is important to the continuation\n\nof the human race, and opposite-sex couples accomplish this objective\n\nbecause procreation occurs naturally within this group.                In contrast, the\n\nCounty points out, same-sex couples can procreate only through assisted\n\nreproductive techniques, and some same-sex couples may choose not to\n\nprocreate.    While heterosexual marriage does lead to procreation, the\n\nargument by the County fails to address the real issue in our required\n\nanalysis of the objective: whether exclusion of gay and lesbian individuals\n\nfrom the institution of civil marriage will result in more procreation?              If\n\nprocreation is the true objective, then the proffered classification must work\n\nto achieve that objective.\n\n      Conceptually, the promotion of procreation as an objective of marriage\n\nis compatible with the inclusion of gays and lesbians within the definition of\n\nmarriage. Gay and lesbian persons are capable of procreation. Thus, the\n\nsole conceivable avenue by which exclusion of gay and lesbian people from\n\ncivil marriage could promote more procreation is if the unavailability of civil\n\nmarriage for same-sex partners caused homosexual individuals to “become”\n\nheterosexual in order to procreate within the present traditional institution\n\nof civil marriage. The briefs, the record, our research, and common sense do\n\nnot suggest such an outcome.           Even if possibly true, the link between\n\nexclusion of gay and lesbian people from marriage and increased procreation\n\nis far too tenuous to withstand heightened scrutiny. Specifically, the statute\n\f                                       60\n\n\nis significantly under-inclusive with respect to the objective of increasing\n\nprocreation because it does not include a variety of groups that do not\n\nprocreate for reasons such as age, physical disability, or choice. In other\n\nwords, the classification is not substantially related to the asserted\n\nlegislative purpose.\n\n      d. Promoting stability in opposite-sex relationships. A fourth suggested\n\nrationale supporting the marriage statute is “promoting stability in opposite\n\nsex relationships.” While the institution of civil marriage likely encourages\n\nstability in opposite-sex relationships, we must evaluate whether excluding\n\ngay and lesbian people from civil marriage encourages stability in opposite-\n\nsex relationships. The County offers no reasons that it does, and we can\n\nfind none.    The stability of opposite-sex relationships is an important\n\ngovernmental interest, but the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage\n\nis not substantially related to that objective.\n\n      e. Conservation of resources. The conservation of state resources is\n\nanother objective arguably furthered by excluding gay and lesbian persons\n\nfrom civil marriage. The argument is based on a simple premise: couples\n\nwho are married enjoy numerous governmental benefits, so the state’s fiscal\n\nburden associated with civil marriage is reduced if less people are allowed to\n\nmarry.   In the common sense of the word, then, it is “rational” for the\n\nlegislature to seek to conserve state resources by limiting the number of\n\ncouples allowed to form civil marriages.      By way of example, the County\n\nhypothesizes that, due to our laws granting tax benefits to married couples,\n\nthe State of Iowa would reap less tax revenue if individual taxpaying gay and\n\nlesbian people were allowed to obtain a civil marriage.     Certainly, Iowa’s\n\nmarriage statute causes numerous government benefits, including tax\n\f                                             61\n\n\nbenefits, to be withheld from plaintiffs.28              Thus, the ban on same-sex\n\nmarriages may conserve some state resources. Excluding any group from\n\ncivil marriage—African-Americans, illegitimates, aliens, even red-haired\n\nindividuals—would conserve state resources in an equally “rational” way.\n\nYet, such classifications so obviously offend our society’s collective sense of\n\nequality that courts have not hesitated to provide added protections against\n\nsuch inequalities.\n\n       One primary requirement of the equal protection clause is a more\n\nsubstantial relationship between the legislative goal and the means used to\n\nattain the goal. When heightened scrutiny is applicable, the means must\n\nsubstantially further the legislative end.            Consequently, in this case, the\n\nsexual-orientation-based         classification    must      substantially     further     the\n\nconservation-of-resources objective.\n\n       As observed in our analysis of the other reasons offered in support of\n\nthe marriage statute, significant degrees of over-inclusion and under-\n\n\n       28Plaintiffs identify over two hundred Iowa statutes affected by civil-marriage status.\nSee, e.g., Iowa Code § 85.31 (dependent surviving spouse receives benefits when spouse\ndeath caused by work injury); id. § 135J.1(4) (hospice patient’s family includes spouse); id.\n§ 142C.4 (spouse has power to make decision concerning anatomical gifts); id. § 144A.7\n(patient’s spouse determines application of life-sustaining procedures in absence of\ndeclaration); id. § 144C.5 (surviving spouse controls disposition of decedent’s remains in\nabsence of declaration); id. § 252A.3(1) (spouse liable for support of other spouse); id.\n§ 252A.3(4) (children of married parents legitimate); id. § 422.7 (spouses may file joint tax\nreturn); id. § 422.9(1) (optional standard deduction for married taxpayers); id. § 422.12(1)(b)\n(spouses eligible for personal exemption credit); id. § 450.3 (inheritance rights of surviving\nspouses); id. § 450.9 (surviving spouse exempt from inheritance tax on property passed from\ndecedent spouse); id. § 450.10(6) (spousal allowance for surviving spouse); id. § 523I.309\n(surviving spouse must consent to decedent spouse’s interment); id. § 613.15 (spouse may\nrecover value of services and support of decedent spouse for wrongful death or negligent\ninjury); id. § 622.9 (restriction of testimony of communication between husband and wife);\nid. § 633.211(1) (surviving spouse receives decedent spouse’s entire estate in intestacy); id.\n§ 633.236 (surviving spouse has right to elective share); id. § 633.272 (surviving spouse\ntakes under partial intestacy if elective share not exercised); id. § 633.336 (damages for\nwrongful death). The Government Accounting Office, as of 2005, had identified more than\n1000 federal legal rights and responsibilities derived from marriage. Isaak, 10 U. Pa. J.\nConst. L. at 607 n.6.\n\f                                       62\n\n\ninclusion shed light on the true relationship between exclusion of gay and\n\nlesbian people from civil marriage and the goal of conserving governmental\n\nresources.     Exclusion of all same-sex couples is an extremely blunt\n\ninstrument for conserving state resources through limiting access to civil\n\nmarriage.     In other words, the exclusion of same-sex couples is over-\n\ninclusive because many same-sex couples, if allowed to marry, would not\n\nuse more state resources than they currently consume as unmarried\n\ncouples.     To reference the County’s example, while many heterosexual\n\ncouples who have obtained a civil marriage do not file joint tax returns—or\n\nexperience any other tax benefit from marital status—many same-sex\n\ncouples may not file a joint tax return either. The two classes created by the\n\nstatute—opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples—may use the same\n\namount of state resources. Thus, the two classes are similarly situated for\n\nthe purpose of conserving state resources, yet the classes are treated\n\ndifferently by the law. In this way, sexual orientation is a flawed indicator of\n\nresource usage.\n\n      Just as exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage is a blunt\n\ninstrument, however, it is also significantly undersized if the true goal is to\n\nconserve state resources.     That is to say, the classification is under-\n\ninclusive.   The goal of conservation of state resources would be equally\n\nserved by excluding any similar-sized group from civil marriage.        Indeed,\n\nunder the County’s logic, more state resources would be conserved by\n\nexcluding groups more numerous than Iowa’s estimated 5800 same-sex\n\ncouples (for example, persons marrying for a second or subsequent time).\n\nImportantly, there is also no suggestion same-sex couples would use more\n\nstate resources if allowed to obtain a civil marriage than heterosexual\n\ncouples who obtain a civil marriage.\n\f                                     63\n\n\n      Such over-inclusion and under-inclusion demonstrates the trait of\n\nsexual orientation is a poor proxy for regulating aspiring spouses’ usage of\n\nstate resources. This tenuous relationship between the classification and its\n\npurpose demonstrates many people who are similarly situated with respect\n\nto the purpose of the law are treated differently. As a result, the sexual-\n\norientation-based classification does not substantially further the suggested\n\ngovernmental interest, as required by intermediate scrutiny.\n\n      4. Conclusion.     Having   examined    each   proffered   governmental\n\nobjective through the appropriate lens of intermediate scrutiny, we conclude\n\nthe sexual-orientation-based classification under the marriage statute does\n\nnot substantially further any of the objectives. While the objectives asserted\n\nmay be important (and many undoubtedly are important), none are\n\nfurthered in a substantial way by the exclusion of same-sex couples from\n\ncivil marriage.   Our equal protection clause requires more than has been\n\noffered to justify the continued existence of the same-sex marriage ban\n\nunder the statute.\n\n      I. Religious Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage. Now that we have\n\naddressed and rejected each specific interest advanced by the County to\n\njustify the classification drawn under the statute, we consider the reason for\n\nthe exclusion of gay and lesbian couples from civil marriage left unspoken by\n\nthe County: religious opposition to same-sex marriage. The County’s silence\n\nreflects, we believe, its understanding this reason cannot, under our Iowa\n\nConstitution, be used to justify a ban on same-sex marriage.\n\n      While unexpressed, religious sentiment most likely motivates many, if\n\nnot most, opponents of same-sex civil marriage and perhaps even shapes the\n\nviews of those people who may accept gay and lesbian unions but find the\n\f                                            64\n\n\nnotion of same-sex marriage unsettling.29             Consequently, we address the\n\nreligious undercurrent propelling the same-sex marriage debate as a means\n\nto fully explain our rationale for rejecting the dual-gender requirement of the\n\nmarriage statute.\n\n       It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to\n\nsame-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex\n\nmarriage, even if only indirectly. Religious objections to same-sex marriage\n\nare   supported      by    thousands       of    years   of   tradition    and     biblical\n\ninterpretation.30      The belief that the “sanctity of marriage” would be\n\nundermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking\n\nconceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining\n\nthe tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples, but better\n\nidentifies the source of the opposition.            Whether expressly or impliedly,\n\nmuch of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere, deeply ingrained—\n\neven fundamental—religious belief.\n\n       Yet, such views are not the only religious views of marriage.                     As\n\ndemonstrated by amicus groups, other equally sincere groups and people in\n\n\n\n\n       29A  survey in the Des Moines Register in 2008 found 28.1% of individuals surveyed\nsupported same-sex marriage, 30.2% opposed same-sex marriage but supported civil\nunions, and 32% of respondents opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions. Erin\nJordan, About 6 in 10 Iowans back same-sex unions, poll finds, Des Moines Register, Nov. 26,\n2008, at 4B. The Des Moines Register survey is consistent with a national survey by the\nPEW Research Center in 2003. This PEW survey found that 59% of Americans oppose\nsame-sex marriage, and 32% favor same-sex marriage. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108.\nHowever, opposition to same-sex marriage jumped to 80% for people “with a high level of\nreligious commitment,” with only 12% of such people in favor of same-sex marriage. Id.\n       30Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2109–12 (discussing the religious arguments against\n\nsame-sex marriage found in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, supporting a\nconclusion that homosexuality is considered to be a sin and same-sex marriage to be an\nextension of that sin).\n\f                                           65\n\n\nIowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the\n\nopposite conclusion.31\n\n       This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of\n\nany religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowa’s same-sex\n\nmarriage ban. Our constitution does not permit any branch of government\n\nto resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of\n\nensuring government avoids them. See Iowa Const. art. I, § 3 (“The general\n\nassembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .”).\n\nThe statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage\n\nfor religious institutions. Instead, the statute declares, “Marriage is a civil\n\ncontract” and then regulates that civil contract. Iowa Code § 595A.1. Thus,\n\nin pursuing our task in this case, we proceed as civil judges, far removed\n\nfrom the theological debate of religious clerics, and focus only on the concept\n\nof civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class\n\nof persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil\n\nmarriage.\n\n       We, of course, have a constitutional mandate to protect the free\n\nexercise of religion in Iowa, which includes the freedom of a religious\n\norganization to define marriages it solemnizes as unions between a man and\n\na woman. See Iowa Const. art. I, § 3 (“The general assembly shall make no\n\nlaw . . . prohibiting the free exercise [of religion] . . . .”). This mission to\n\nprotect religious freedom is consistent with our task to prevent government\n\n\n        31Many religions recognize same-sex marriage, such as Buddhists, Quakers,\n\nUnitarians, and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108.\nAmicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders, Communities, and Scholars point out the\nUnited Church of Christ encourages, but does not require, its local congregations to adopt\nwedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples,\nwhile the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex\nweddings as a matter of pastoral care. Additionally, many groups and clergy within various\nreligions are working to achieve inclusion of same-sex marriage. Id. at 2108–09.\n\f                                        66\n\n\nfrom endorsing any religious view.

This\n\nproposition is the essence of the separation of church and state.\n\n      As a result, civil marriage must be judged under our constitutional\n\nstandards of equal protection and not under religious doctrines or the\n\nreligious views of individuals.       This approach does not disrespect or\n\ndenigrate the religious views of many Iowans who may strongly believe in\n\nmarriage as a dual-gender union, but considers, as we must, only the\n\nconstitutional rights of all people, as expressed by the promise of equal\n\nprotection for all. We are not permitted to do less and would damage our\n\nconstitution immeasurably by trying to do more.\n\n      The only legitimate inquiry we can make is whether [the statute]\n      is constitutional.

These principles require that the state recognize\n\nboth opposite-sex and same-sex civil marriage. Religious doctrine and views\n\ncontrary to this principle of law are unaffected, and people can continue to\n\nassociate with the religion that best reflects their views.             A religious\n\ndenomination can still define marriage as a union between a man and a\n\nwoman, and a marriage ceremony performed by a minister, priest, rabbi, or\n\nother person ordained or designated as a leader of the person’s religious\n\f                                           67\n\n\nfaith does not lose its meaning as a sacrament or other religious institution.\n\nThe sanctity of all religious marriages celebrated in the future will have the\n\nsame meaning as those celebrated in the past. The only difference is civil\n\nmarriage will now take on a new meaning that reflects a more complete\n\nunderstanding of equal protection of the law.              This result is what our\n\nconstitution requires.\n\n       J. Constitutional Infirmity. We are firmly convinced the exclusion\n\nof gay and lesbian people from the institution of civil marriage does not\n\nsubstantially further any important governmental objective. The legislature\n\nhas excluded a historically disfavored class of persons from a supremely\n\nimportant civil institution without a constitutionally sufficient justification.\n\nThere is no material fact, genuinely in dispute, that can affect this\n\ndetermination.\n\n       We have a constitutional duty to ensure equal protection of the law.\n\nFaithfulness to that duty requires us to hold Iowa’s marriage statute, Iowa\n\nCode section 595.2, violates the Iowa Constitution.              To decide otherwise\n\nwould be an abdication of our constitutional duty. If gay and lesbian people\n\nmust submit to different treatment without an exceedingly persuasive\n\njustification, they are deprived of the benefits of the principle of equal\n\nprotection upon which the rule of law is founded. Iowa Code section 595.2\n\ndenies gay and lesbian people the equal protection of the law promised by\n\nthe Iowa Constitution.32\n       V. Remedy.\n\n       Because our civil marriage statute fails to provide equal protection of\n\nthe law under the Iowa Constitution, we must decide how to best remedy the\n\n\n       32Our  decision that the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Iowa\nConstitution makes it unnecessary to address the other bases for plaintiffs’ challenge to\nIowa’s marriage statute.\n\f                                        68\n\n\nconstitutional violation. The sole remedy requested by plaintiffs is admission\n\ninto the institution of civil marriage.      The County does not suggest an\n\nalternative remedy.     The high courts of other jurisdictions have remedied\n\nconstitutionally invalid bans on same-sex marriage in two ways.             Some\n\ncourts have ordered gay and lesbian people to be allowed to access the\n\ninstitution of civil marriage.   See In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 453;\n\nKerrigan, 957 A.2d at 480 (“definition of marriage necessarily must be\n\nexpanded” to include same-sex couples); Opinions of the Justices to the\n\nSenate, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571 (Mass. 2004). Other courts have allowed their\n\nstate legislatures to create parallel civil institutions for same-sex couples.\n\nSee Lewis v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1551161\"><a href=\"/opinion/1551161/lewis-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (N.J. 2006); Baker v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2264443\"><a href=\"/opinion/2264443/baker-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 887 (Vt. 1999).\n\n      Iowa Code section 595.2 is unconstitutional because the County has\n\nbeen unable to identify a constitutionally adequate justification for excluding\n\nplaintiffs from the institution of civil marriage. A new distinction based on\n\nsexual orientation would be equally suspect and difficult to square with the\n\nfundamental principles of equal protection embodied in our constitution.\n\nThis record, our independent research, and the appropriate equal protection\n\nanalysis do not suggest the existence of a justification for such a legislative\n\nclassification   that   substantially   furthers   any   governmental   objective.\n\nConsequently, the language in Iowa Code section 595.2 limiting civil\n\nmarriage to a man and a woman must be stricken from the statute, and the\n\nremaining statutory language must be interpreted and applied in a manner\n\nallowing gay and lesbian people full access to the institution of civil\n\nmarriage.\n\f                                            69\n\n\n       VI. Conclusion.\n\n       The district court properly granted summary judgment to plaintiffs.\n\nIowa Code section 595.2 violates the equal protection provision of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.        Our     decision     becomes      effective    upon     issuance        of\n\nprocedendo.33\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n       All justices concur.\n\n\n\n\n       33See  Iowa R. App. P. 6.1208 (stating procedendo shall issue twenty-one days after\nthe opinion is filed unless a petition for rehearing is filed).\n\f</pre>",
