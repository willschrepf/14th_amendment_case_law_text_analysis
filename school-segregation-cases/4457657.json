To\n\ndemonstrate why leave to amend should be granted, Appellees and Cross-\n\nAppellants respectfully show as follows:\n\n                              I. Nature of the Correction\n\n         Leave to amend is sought to correct the omission of ten words from the first\n\nsentence fragment of the third paragraph of the Summary of Argument on page 5\n\n\n                                            1\nMHDocs 6179368_1 12690.2\n\fof the Appellees’ Brief. That fragment reads, “acquired during its history that does\n\nnot address the issue here: whether RLJ satisfied Chapter 38.” It should have read,\n\n“The Architect’s argument relies on the general patina Chapter 38 acquired during\n\nits history that does not address the issue here: whether RLJ satisfied Chapter 38.”\n\nNo other alterations than the necessary correction to the word count in the\n\ncertificate of compliance and correction of the date on the certificate of service will\n\nbe made to the Amended Appellees’ Brief, a true and correct copy of which is\n\nattached as Exhibit “A” to this motion.\n\n                    II. Explanation of the Cause of the Need to Amend\n\n         The omission making this motion necessary was the result of an error that\n\noccurred during the final preparation of the brief. Using Microsoft Word, the last\n\nversion of the summary of argument was pasted in its entirety into the Appellees’\n\nBrief. In the process of doing so, the omitted phrase was deleted. Because the\n\ndocument was copied and pasted in its entirety, it was anticipated that the summary\n\nof argument appeared in the brief as it had appeared in the source document. That\n\nit did not so appear was not detected until after Appellees’ Brief was filed.\n\n                  III. Not Opposed by Counsel for Appellant, Cross-Appellee.\n\n         On Friday, June 12, 2015, counsel for the parties to this appeal conferred\n\nconcerning this motion to amend. Counsel for Appellant and Cross-Appellee is not\n\nopposed to the relief this motion requests.\n\n\n                                           2\nMHDocs 6179368_1 12690.2\n\f                                IV. Relief Requested\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, Appellees and Cross-Appellants request that this\n\nmotion be granted and that the court accept for filing Amended Appellees’ Brief\n\ntendered this day for filing in this cause. Appellees and Cross-Appellants further\n\nrequest any other relief to which this motion may entitle them.\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              MUNSCH HARDT KOPF & HARR PC\n\n\n                                              /s/Michael W.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n       This is a breach of contract case arising out of severe foundation problems at\n\nthe Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, located on East Ben White Boulevard, near\n\nBergstrom International Airport (“Project”). (CR187) 1. RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP;\n\nRLJ II-C Austin Air Lessee, LP; and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC\n\n(“RLJ” collectively), sued, among others, the architect, general contractor and soils\n\nengineer for breaching their separate contractual responsibilities related to the\n\nProject’s construction. (CR184-218). RLJ asserted that claim as assignee of and\n\nsuccessor-in-interest to and assignee of the rights under the Architectural Contract\n\nand the contract cause of action of White Lodging Services Corp. (“Owner”),\n\noriginal owner of the Project. (CR1124;1063-64). The architect, Elness, Swenson,\n\nGraham. Inc. (“Architect”), was the only remaining defendant when the case was\n\nsubmitted to the jury. (CR1121-29). Due to settlements by other parties and the\n\ntrial court’s pre-trial rulings, breach of contract was the only liability theory against\n\nthe Architect. Id.\n\n       The jury found that the Architect failed to “comply with the Architectural\n\nContract regarding the structural engineering services required by the contract”\n\n\n1\n  The Clerk’s Record is cited as “CR”; First Supplemental Clerk’s Record,“1SCR”; Second\nSupplemental Clerk’s Record, “2SCR”; Third Supplemental Clerk’s Record, “3SCR”). The\nReporters Record is cited by “[Volume Number]RR” Exhibits are cited to page or pages of the\nReporter’s Record on which they or the pertinent parts thereof appear. “4SCR__” refers to the\nsupplemental clerk’s record that is being requested, but is not yet available. See n.14.\n\n\n                                             1\n\f(“Structural Engineering Question”). (CR1126). The jury’s verdict assessed\n\n$785,000 in damages for the breach. (CR1125-27).\n\n       After trial, the Architect moved for and the trial court allowed credit under\n\nthe one satisfaction rule for $1.17 million paid by the General Contractor and the\n\nSoils Engineer (“Settling Defendants” collectively) in settlement of the contract\n\nclaims against them. (CR1173-79,1439,1710). The parties agreed to try the\n\nattorney’s fees claimed under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode (“Chapter 38”2) to the court instead of the jury. (CR201,1710).\n\n       RLJ presented evidence of its reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees for\n\nasserting the contractual claims against the Architect and the Settling Defendants.\n\n(3SCR3-611;2SCR1603-1605). The trial court only awarded fees for the\n\ncontractual claim against the Architect. For that claim, it determined that RLJ was\n\nentitled to recover from the Architect $901,650.96 as reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(CR1711). The trial court rendered judgment for RLJ in the principal sum of\n\n$516,650.96. (CR1711). It arrived at this amount by adding the amount of the\n\ndamages awarded in the jury verdict with the amount of the Chapter 38 attorney’s\n\nfees award, then subtracting the amounts paid in settlement by the Settling\n\nDefendants. (Id.).

(Id.). The Architect timely filed its notice of\n\nappeal (CR1907-1913) and RLJ timely perfected its cross-appeal (1SCR3-4).\n\n                          II.     ISSUES PRESENTED\nA.    Whether the trial court correctly allowed RLJ to recover its attorney’s fees\n\n      under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code even if it\n\n      correctly applied the one satisfaction rule to offset the jury’s damage award?\n\nB.    Whether the trial court correctly determined that RLJ has standing to sue the\n\n      Architect under the assignments of rights from RLJ’s predecessors-in-\n\n      interest?\n\nC.    Whether the trial court’s determination may be further supported by\n\n      consideration of the supplemental clarification which the trial court\n\n      erroneously deemed parol evidence inappropriate for consideration?\n\n      (Appellees’ Reply Point).\n\nD.    Whether the trial court correctly ruled that the Architectural Contract was\n\n      not inadmissible hearsay and was sufficiently authenticated?\n\nE.    Whether the trial court erred in submitting the contractual liability issue\n\n      concerning structural engineering services and, in the unlikely event that it\n\n      did, whether the Architect failed to preserve the complaints it makes in this\n\n      appeal?\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fF.    Whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the damages for\n\n      diminution in value awarded by the jury?\n\n                         III.   STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      RLJ is not satisfied with the accuracy of Architect’s Statement of Facts and\n\nincludes the following as a brief statement of the facts relevant to Appellant’s\n\nissues. The proceedings below are described in the Statement of the Case and as\n\nnecessary in the argument section of this brief. RLJ also refers the court to the\n\nStatement of Facts in Cross-Appellant’s Brief at 6-13, and reserves to the argument\n\nsection further discussion of the facts relevant to those issues.\n\n      The Architect contracted with the Owner to design the Project. The\n\nArchitectural Contract obliged the Architect to provide architectural and structural\n\nengineering services. (12RR39,47). Under a separate contract to which the Owner\n\nwas not a party, the Architect engaged “[o]ur Structural Engineering firm...Marlin\n\nBridges Associates, Inc.” (“Structural Engineer”) to design the foundation.\n\n(12RR17-25,30,35,47,49;App.G).\n\n      Before the Project was complete, RLJ contracted to purchase the Project\n\nfrom the Owner, along with numerous other hotels. (CR184-218;606-676;707-\n\n709;App.J). Before RLJ closed the purchase of this hotel, the Project experienced\n\nsome cracking in the laundry room and around the pool area. (3RR122). RLJ was\n\nadvised that repair costs would be $50,000 (3RR187-88), and it received a credit of\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fthe same amount3 and closed the purchase. (CR626-28). After closing, the Project\n\nbegan to experience cracks in partition walls, shifting door frames, and other issues\n\nevident of foundation movement. (3RR118;4RR78-79;7RR47). Investigation\n\nrevealed the foundation design was inappropriate for the soil conditions at this site.\n\n(4RR111). This litigation ensued.\n\n                         IV.    SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n       None of the Architect’s complaints permit it to elude its liabilities for failing\n\nto comply with the Architectural Contract’s concerning the provision of structural\n\nengineering services.\n\n       Its attack on liability for RLJ’s attorney’s fees is invalid. As the verdict\n\nestablished, it had a valid claim for a just amount owed that was presented and\n\nunpaid for years, and which remained unpaid when this case was tried. Nothing in\n\nChapter 38 further requires the claimant to recover those damages in a judgment.\n\nThe Legislature eliminated that requirement when it amended the statute 38 years\n\nago. Neither it nor the Architect’s cited cases require the claimant to obtain a\n\njudgment. The Texas Supreme Court has said so. This Court has said so.\n\n       The Architect’s argument relies on the general patina Chapter 38 acquired\n\nduring its history that does not address the issue here: whether RLJ satisfied\n\n\n3\n  The Architect is incorrect to suggest this adjustment amount was for all of the Project’s\nfoundation problems that ultimately manifested themselves. (Appellant’s Brief 5-6). It was only\nfor the limited issues then known. (3RR187-88).\n\n\n                                              5\n\fChapter 38. The alpha and omega of that inquiry is the statute itself, not the\n\nlanguage of cases, other statutes, or general concepts about attorney’s fee recovery.\n\n       The trial court adhered to the precise language of the statute when it awarded\n\nRLJ its attorney’s fees. Even if the one satisfaction rule applied so that credit for a\n\nsettlement during trial could preclude recovery of the jury’s damage award, the\n\ntrial court did not err in allowing RLJ to recover its attorney’s after application of\n\nthat credit.\n\n       RLJ also had standing to sue on the Architectural Contract by virtue of an\n\nassignment of all intangible assets related to the Project. The Architect’s only\n\nargument is that a cause of action is not an intangible asset. This court, other\n\njurisdictions, and even the dictionary on which the Architect bases its argument,\n\nrecognize that a cause of action is an asset that is intangible. A supplement to this\n\nassignment made clear that it included all “causes of action” against the Architect.\n\nThe trial court erroneously ruled that it could consider the supplement, but it may\n\nnevertheless support the trial court’s standing determination because it was not\n\nparol evidence at all. Even if it were, the Architect was not a party to the contract\n\nthe supplement concerned and, therefore, could not invoke the parol evidence rule.\n\n       The Architect’s complaint that the Architectural Contract was inadmissible\n\nhearsay is baseless. The contract was not offered to prove anything other than the\n\nfact that it said what it said. Its complaint about improper authentication is equally\n\n\n                                          6\n\fflawed. The Architect used the contract as an exhibit and proved that it was a\n\nbusiness record.\n\n      The Architect waived its complaint that RLJ should have been required to\n\nprove its derivative liability for the Structural Engineer’s errors by failing to\n\nspecially except, file a verified plea that it was not liable in the capacity sued, and\n\nfailing to preserve its complaints at the charge conference. In any event, RLJ was\n\nnot obliged to establish vicarious liability because the Architect had direct,\n\ncontractual liability. Its only support to the contrary is a case that was long ago\n\nsuperseded by the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n      The Architect finally challenges the sufficiency of the expert testimony to\n\nsupport the jury’s diminution-in-value damage award. That testimony employed\n\naccepted appraisal methodologies and standards. Indeed, the valuation method\n\nused was the one the Texas Supreme Court has deemed appropriate. The valuation\n\ndate used was the date that was submitted in the court’s charge – an appropriate\n\ndate given what be considered. Criticism of the appraiser for allegedly failing to\n\nprovide actual performance data is baseless because the appraiser in fact provided\n\nit. His testimony did not include “stigma” damages and did not include damages\n\nfor lost profits. The damages need not have been “segregated” to be legally\n\nsufficient. Legally sufficient evidence supported the jury’s damage assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                      V.     ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.     The Trial Court Correctly Awarded RLJ Its Attorney’s Fees.\n       The Architect asserts the trial court erred in awarding RLJ Chapter 38\n\nattorney’s fees. It argues Chapter 38 required RLJ to “recover damages” without\n\nspecifying what a “recovery” of damages is. (Appellant’s Brief 16,17). The jury\n\nfound $785,000 in damages.4 (CR1127;App.B). Apparently, the Architect contends\n\nthe jury’s damage award does not suffice and that Texas Civil Practice &\n\nRemedies Code §38.001 (“§38.001”) requires a judgment awarding damages to\n\nrecover attorney’s fees. The Architect’s complaint is moot if this Court rules that\n\nthe one satisfaction rule is inapplicable. 5 (Cross-Appellants’ Brief 13-58).\n\n       1.     Chapter 38 Does Not Require a Judgment for Damages.\n       The Architect’s argument is also wrong. Chapter 38 does not now require\n\nand has not for nearly 40 years required a judgment awarding damages. McKinley\n\nv. Drozd, 685 S.W.2d 7, 10-11 (Tex. 1985); Buckner Glass & Mirror Inc. v. T.A.\n\nPritchard Co., 697 S.W.2d 712, 714 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1985, no writ);\n\nEnriquez v. K & D Development & Construction, Inc., 567 S.W.2d 40, 42 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—El Paso 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The Architect’s assertion that the jury “found” RLJ’s damages “greatly exaggerated”\n(Appellant’s Brief 17) is incorrect. There was no such finding.\n5\n  RLJ’s attorney’s fees arguments are presented subject to and without waiving its arguments that\nthe one satisfaction rule is inapplicable.\n\n\n                                               8\n\f            a.     The “Judgment” Requirement Was Eliminated by\n                   the 1977 Amendment to Chapter 38’s Predecessor.\n      In 1977, the Legislature amended the predecessor to Chapter 38 to eliminate\n\n“finally obtain judgment” as a condition to recovering attorney’s fees. Compare\n\nAct of May 17, 1971, ch. 225, §1, 1971 TEX. GEN. LAWS 1073 (former article\n\n2226), with Act of April 25, 1977, ch. 76, §1, 1977 TEX. GEN. LAWS 153;\n\nMcKinley, 685 S.W.2d at 10-11 (explaining effect of amendment and court’s\n\nfailure to notice it). If the Legislature wishes to re-impose recovery of damages in\n\nthe judgment to recover attorney’s fees, it may do so. Judicial resurrection of this\n\nrequirement after Legislative elimination would impermissibly transgress the\n\nconstitutional separation of legislative authority from judicial power. See Lee v.\n\nCity of Houston, 807 S.W.2d 290, 293 (Tex. 1991); Texas Alcoholic Beverage\n\nComm'n v. Kings Four, Inc., 583 S.W.2d 676, 678 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1979,\n\nno writ).\n\n            b.     The Texas Supreme Court and This Court Have\n                   Rejected Any Such Requirement.\n      If “obtain[ing] judgment” were still necessary, the Texas Supreme Court\n\ncould not have allowed recovery of attorney’s fees in McKinley. There, the\n\nclaimant received a verdict for contract damages, but did not recover them in the\n\njudgment because of an offsetting counterclaim. Nevertheless, the court awarded\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fattorney’s fees because the claimant met the statutory requirements without a\n\njudgment for damages. 685 S.W.2d at 11.\n\n      This court also recognized, under circumstances very similar to those in this\n\ncase, that a party may recover Chapter 38 attorney’s fees without recovering\n\ndamages in the judgment. In A.D. Willis Co. v. Metal Bldg. Components, Inc., No.\n\n03-99-00574-CV, 2000 WL 1508500 (Tex. App.—Austin Oct. 12, 2000, pet.\n\ndenied)(not designated for publication), the jury awarded damages for the\n\nclaimant’s breach of contract claim, but found a greater             loss caused by the\n\nclaimant’s failure to mitigate. This Court ruled Chapter 38 attorney’s fees could\n\nnot be denied merely for want of damage recovery in the judgment. Id. at *5. Like\n\na settlement credit, failure to mitigate reduces recovery because it “tends to rebut\n\nthe measure of damages under the [plaintiff’s] claim of breach.” Austin Hill\n\nCountry Realty, Inc. v. Palisades Plaza, Inc., 948 S.W.2d 293, 300 (Tex. 1997).\n\nThis Court noted that the claimant had a “valid claim” for a “just amount” unpaid\n\non the thirtieth day following presentment. Because McKinley rejected a “net\n\nrecovery” requirement, this Court allowed attorney’s fees despite no judgment\n\nawarding damages. 6 Id. at *6.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  This reasoning is consistent with Perez v. Baker Packers, 694 S.W.2d 138, 143 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.), in which a claimant whose damages offset by\nsettlement credits was deemed the “successful party” entitled to recover rule 131 costs.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f               c.     The Architect’s Cases Do Not Say Otherwise.\n       The Architect’s attack rests entirely on cases saying recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees generally requires the claimant “(1) prevail on a cause of action for which\n\nattorney’s fees are recoverable, and (2) recover damages,” Intercontinental Group\n\nP’ship v. KB Home Lone Star, L.P., 295 S.W.3d 650, 653 (Tex. 2009)7; MBM Fin.\n\nCorp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., 292 S.W.3d 660, 664, 666 (Tex. 2009)(no\n\nproof); Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 390 (Tex. 1997); State Farm\n\nLife Ins. Co. v. Beaston, 907 S.W.2d 430, 434, 437 (Tex. 1995); see also Mustang\n\nPipeline Co. v. Driver Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d 195, 201 (Tex. 2004); Haubold v.\n\nMedical Carbon Research Inst., LLC, No. 03-11-00115-CV, 2014 WL 1018008 at\n\n*6, *7 (Tex. App.—Austin Mar. 14, 2014, no pet.)(mem. op.).\n\n       Closer examination of the facts in these cases reveals that “recovery” does\n\nnot require a judgment awarding damages. Instead, they hold that one cannot\n\nrecover attorney’s fees when there is no possibility of liability. In each, there was\n\nno recovery because: (1) the jury found zero damages; (2) liability was not\n\nestablished; or (3) no legally competent evidence supported awarding damages.\n\nIntercontinental Group, 295 S.W.3d at 653, 655 (no finding); MBM Fin. Corp.,\n\n292 S.W.3d at 664, 666 (Tex. 2009)(no proof); Mustang Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d\n\n7\n An example of the Architect’s superficial analysis is its assertion that this case “hold[s] that,\nabsent recovery of damages, attorney’s fees are not recoverable under Chapter 38.” (Appellant’s\nBrief 15). The opinion, however, says Chapter 38 “is not controlling.” Intercontinental Group,\n295 S.W.3d at 653.\n\n\n                                               11\n\fat 201 (no proof); Solis, 951 S.W.2d at 390 (Tex. 1997)(no finding); Beaston, 907\n\nS.W.2d at 434, 437 (no proof of damages under DTPA); Blizzard v. Nationwide\n\nMut. Fire Ins. Co., 756 S.W.2d 801, 806 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988, no writ)(no\n\nunpaid damages 8); Fire Ins. Exchg. v. Sullivan, 192 S.W.3d 99, 102, 110-11 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied)(same 9); Haubold (claimant sought\n\nno recoverable damages). None of them address a situation like McKinley or A.D.\n\nWillis Co. in which the claim is valid but results no recovery under a judgment.\n\nThey do not, as the Architect suggests, require the recovery of damages by\n\njudgment.\n\n       2.     Chapter 38 Only Requires a Valid Claim Timely\n              Presented and Unpaid for Thirty Days.\n       The foregoing shows Chapter 38 does not require the recovery of damages\n\nin a judgment. The inquiry may now focus on what Chapter 38 does require.\n\n              a.     The Architect Ignores Proper Statutory\n                     Interpretation.\n       All statutory interpretation begins with the statute’s language. Ross v. St.\n\nLuke’s Episcopal Hosp., 58 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 766, 2015 WL 2009744 at *3 (Tex.\n\nMay 1, 2015); Lippincott v. Whisenhunt, 58 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 705, 2015 WL\n\n8\n  In both Beaston and Blizzard, there was no breach of contract at all. The insurers paid more\nthan the policy required. Neither claimant in those cases had a “valid claim.” See Kleas, 2013\nWL 4516120, at *2.\n9\n  In Sullivan, the insurer had also paid more than the damages later found so there was never a\n“valid claim” for breach of the policy or a DTPA violation that would support recovery of\nattorney’s fees.\n\n\n                                              12\n\f1967025 at *1(Tex. Apr. 27, 2015)(per curiam). The goal is to ascertain the\n\nLegislature’s intent from that language alone, Leland v. Brandal, 257 S.W.3d 204,\n\n206 (Tex. 2008), by considering the all statutory language in context, not in\n\nisolation. See Union Carbide Corp. v. Synatzske, 438 S.W.3d 39, 51 (Tex. 2014).\n\nUnder the guise of interpretation, Courts may not add to or remove words from an\n\nunambiguous statute. City of Rockwall v. Hughes, 246 S.W.3d 621, 631 (Tex.\n\n2008). Undefined, unambiguous words have their ordinary meaning. Tex. Lottery\n\nComm’n v. First State Bank of DeQueen, 325 S.W.3d 628, 635 (Tex. 2010);\n\nLeland, 257 S.W.3d at 206. Further, the Legislature has rejected narrow\n\nconstruction of Chapter 38 and mandates instead that it “be liberally construed to\n\npromote its underlying purposes.”10 TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §38.005. That\n\npurpose is to discourage unnecessary litigation over just claims. McKinley, 685\n\nS.W.2d at 10-11.\n\n               b.     The Architect Attempts to Add Words to Chapter\n                      38 By Misapplication of Cases.\n       The Architect’s argument ignores these well-settled rules and relies on case\n\nlanguage interpreting other attorney’s fees statutes or previous versions of Chapter\n\n\n10\n   Article 2226 was also amended in 1979 to add claims for oral and written contracts and to\nmandate liberal statutory construction to overturn the previous rule that it should be strictly\nconstrued because recovery of attorney’s fees was contrary to common law. See, e.g., Van Zandt\nv. Fort Worth Press, 359 S.W.2d 893, 995 (Tex. 1962). Without intending to change the statute's\nmeaning, in 1985 the Legislature codified the 1979 version of article 2226 into the Civil Practice\nand Remedies Code. Grapevine Excavation, Inc. v. Maryland Lloyds, 35 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex.\n2000).\n\n\n                                               13\n\f38 with language different from Chapter 38. See V.A.1.c., supra. Nothing in\n\nChapter 38 says the claimant must either “prevail” or “recover damages.” To\n\n“prevail” is only required for recovery of attorney’s fees under the DTPA and\n\nInsurance Code, not Chapter 38. TEX. BUS. & COMM. CODE §17.50(d); TEX. INS.\n\nCODE §541.152. Nevertheless, the Architect relies on cases interpreting these\n\ndissimilar or outdated statutes to impermissibly superimpose requirements not\n\nsupported by Chapter 38’s language. Reading words into a statute impermissibly\n\nusurps the legislative prerogative. See Hughes, 246 S.W.3d at 631. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court has ruled that constructions of disparate language in other\n\nattorney's fees statutes do not control what Chapter 38 means. McKinley, 685\n\nS.W.2d at 9; Jakab v. Gran Villa Townhouses Homeowners Ass'n, Inc., 149\n\nS.W.3d 863, 868 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.). 11\n\n\n\n\n11\n   In Solis, without acknowledging its holding in McKinley, the court included “prevail” as part\nof its two-part “test” for Chapter 38. 951 S.W.2d at 390. This led some courts to improperly look\nto federal attorney’s fees statutes with a “prevail” requirement. E.g.,, Intercontinental Group,\n295 S.W.3d at 654. Even under the federal standard, RLJ “prevailed” by procuring a settlement,\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 11-12 (1992); Intercontinental Group, 295 S.W.3d at 654, of its\nclaim for damages for which all defendants must have been jointly liable if the one satisfaction\nrule applies. Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex. 1991). RLJ also\nsucceeded by establishing liability and receiving a damages verdict. Several Texas Chapter 38\ncases permit attorney’s fees with no damage award if the claimant recovers “something of\nvalue,” such as a decree for specific performance. Jones, 614 S.W.2d at 96, 100–01; Rasmusson\nv. LBC PetroUnited, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 283, 287 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet.\ndenied).\n\n\n                                               14\n\f      3.     Chapter 38 Only Requires a Valid Claim Timely\n             Presented and Unpaid for Thirty Days.\n      Chapter 38 only requires (1) that the claimant be represented by an attorney;\n\n(2) that the claim be for a specified type; (3) that the claim be “valid” and (4)\n\npresented; and (5) that the just amount owing not be tendered within 30 days after\n\npresentment. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§38.001-.002. If these conditions are\n\nsatisfied, the claimant may recover attorney’s fees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§38.001. In the present case, the meaning of the statutory requirements for\n\nrepresentation of counsel, presentment, and type of claim are not at issue.\n\n             a.    A “Valid Claim” Is Required.\n      Under §38.001, “[a] person may recover reasonable attorney’s fees … in\n\naddition to the amount of a valid claim” for a “written contract.” TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE §38.001. Chapter 38 further informs that a “valid claim” is one with\n\na “just amount owed.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §38.002(2). As McKinley\n\nand A. D. Willis illustrate, a “valid claim” authorizing Chapter 38 attorney’s fees\n\nexists with a verdict of liability and resulting damages, even if award of those\n\ndamages is ultimately rendered in the judgment.\n\n                   1)     “In [A]ddition [T]o” Does Not Imply a\n                          “Valid Claim” Requires a Judgment\n                          Awarding Damages.\n      Yet, the Architect also cites cases suggesting that the phrase “in addition to\n\nthe amount of a valid claim” implies there must be some damage amount awarded\n\n\n                                         15\n\fin the judgment to recover Chapter 38 attorney’s fees. (Appellant’s Brief 16). Its\n\nreliance on Solis, 951 S.W.2d at 390, MBM Fin. Corp., 292 S.W.3d at 666, and\n\nHaubold, 2014 WL 1018008 at *6, for this interpretation is misplaced. In all three,\n\nthere was no valid verdict awarding damages because the jury found no damages\n\nor the damage finding was unsupported by competent evidence. Further,\n\nsuggesting that Chapter 38 requires either a verdict or judgment for monetary\n\ndamages ignores that Chapter 38 attorney’s fees may be recovered when only non-\n\nmonetary relief is obtained. See, e.g., Jones v. Kelley, 614 S.W.2d 95, 96, 100–01\n\n(Tex.1981); Rasmusson v. LBC PetroUnited, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 283, 287 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied); Martini v. Tatum, 776 S.W.2d 666,\n\n668, 670 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1989, writ denied)(contractual liability decided but\n\nno judgment awarding monetary relief); De La Rosa v. Kaples, 812 S.W.2d 432,\n\n433, 435 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1991, writ denied)(same).\n\n                   2)    A Verdict Awarding Damages Is Enough To\n                         Have a “Valid Claim.”\n      As McKinley and A. D. Willis amply demonstrate, recovery of damages in a\n\njudgment is not necessary. If the existence of a “valid claim” included a\n\nrequirement that the claimant “recover” as the Architect’s cases suggest, it is\n\napparent that a verdict of liability and awarding damages is “recovery” enough to\n\nhave a valid claim. Rogers v. RAB Inv. Ltd., 816 S.W.2d 543, 551 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 1991, no writ), observed, “Without a jury finding of damages or a recovery\n\n\n                                        16\n\fof damages, there can be no award of attorney’s fees” under §38.001. By negative\n\nimplication, Solis also suggests that a jury verdict is a “recovery” by treating a zero\n\ndamages verdict as a failure to “recover.”\n\n             b.     Chapter 38 Requires the Valid Claim to Remain\n                    Unpaid 30 Days After Presentment.\n      Chapter 38 also specifies when the valid claim must exist. “Payment for the\n\njust amount owed must not have been tendered before the expiration of the 30th\n\nday after the claim is presented.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §38.002(3). As\n\nalready discussed, the reason why the Legislature authorized the recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees was to encourage pre-trial settlement of valid claims and thereby\n\navoid unnecessary litigation over just claims. McKinley, 685 S.W.2d at 10-11;\n\nJones v. Kelley, 614 S.W.2d 95, 100 (Tex. 1981); see also Doctors Hosp. 1997,\n\nL.P. v. Sambuca Houston, L.P., 154 S.W.3d 634, 638 (Tex. App—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2004, pet. abated); Manges v. Mustang Oil Tool Co., 658 S.W.2d 725, 730\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Permitting recovery of Chapter\n\n38 attorney’s fees based on the validity of the claim before events trial instead of\n\nafter it commences is “more consistent” with (1) “legislative intent” to discourage\n\nunnecessary litigation over just claims, and (2) the statutory liberal construction\n\nmandate to “promote its underlying purpose.” McKinley, 685 at 10-11; TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE §38.005; Act of June 6, 1979, 66th Leg., R.S., ch. 314, §1,\n\n1979 TEX. GEN. LAWS 718.\n\n\n                                          17\n\f      Of course, trial results affect whether there was ever a valid claim. A finding\n\nof no liability or zero damages, or want of legally sufficient evidence of either\n\nestablishes no valid claim ever existed. See cases cited in V.A.1.c., supra.\n\nHowever, allowing a claim’s validity to be undermined by credits for settlements\n\nthat occur during trial, which is the situation here, defeats Chapter 38’s purpose.\n\nSettlements during trial do not avoid the unnecessary expense that Chapter 38 was\n\nintended to avoid.\n\n      The distinction between pre-trial and during trial settlements was critical to\n\nthis Court’s analysis in Osborne v. Jauregui, Inc., 252 S.W.3d 70, 75-77 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2008, pet. denied). Unlike the present Chapter 38 breach-of-contract\n\ncase, Osborne involved recovery of attorney’s fees under the DTPA, under which\n\nthe issue was whether the plaintiff “prevailed” – something Chapter 38 does not\n\nrequire. See V.A.2.a., supra. However, the analogy is instructive with respect to\n\nwhen the validity of the claim is measured. In Osborne, the plaintiff settled before\n\ntrial commenced with all but one defendant for an amount greater than the\n\ndamages awarded by the jury against the remaining defendant. Osborne, 252\n\nS.W.3d at 73. RLJ, on the other hand, reached the relevant settlement after trial\n\ncommenced.\n\n      This Court recognized in Osborne that “a net recovery is not necessary for a\n\nplaintiff to be considered a prevailing party.” Osborne, 252 S.W.3d at 76. But it\n\n\n                                        18\n\fconcluded, reasonably enough, that a party does not “prevail” at trial when it\n\nreceived before trial more than it recovered at trial for tort damages that all\n\ndefendants would have jointly and severally liable for under the contribution\n\nstatute. “It is one thing to allow attorney’s fees notwithstanding an opposing\n\nparty’s success on an offsetting claim. However it is another to allow attorney’s\n\nfees on a claim that, although successful, was paid before trial.” Id. (Emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n      The logic of Osborne implicit in the concept of what it means to “prevail” is\n\nexplicit under Chapter 38 which specifically says attorney’s fees may be recovered\n\nif the claim is valid and unpaid for more than thirty days after presentment. It\n\nshould be noted that some cases have suggest that fees are recoverable under\n\nChapter 38 if the presented claim is unpaid before trial commences. Peissel v.\n\nPeissel, 620 S.W.2d 796, 800 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1981, no\n\nwrit). Cases can neither add nor subtract from Chapter 38’s plain language that the\n\nclaim need only be valid thirty days after presentment. For reasons discussed\n\nbelow, resolving that discrepancy is unnecessary here.\n\n      Chapter 38’s concern with whether a valid claim that existed before a trial\n\nbegins is the basis of the so-called “exception” to McKinley disallowing attorney’s\n\nfees if the claimant’s contract damages are fully offset by a “credit” for sums the\n\ndefendant paid. In these cases, including Osborne, the “credit” was due to\n\n\n                                        19\n\fpayments madd worade before trial so that there was no “valid claim” for a “just\n\namount owing” remaining when trial commenced. Blizzard, 756 S.W.2d at 806 12;\n\nOsborne, 252 S.W.3d at 74, 76-77; Imperial Lofts, Ltd. v. Imperial Woodworks,\n\nInc., 245 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex. App.—Waco 2007, pet. denied); Buccaneer Homes of\n\nAla., Inc. v. Pelis, 43 S.W.3d 586, 591 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no\n\npet.); Hamra v. Gulden, 898 S.W.2d 16, 19 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, writ dism’d\n\nw.o.j.); Sullivan, 192 S.W.3d at 109-110.\n\n          Assume arguendo the one satisfaction rule applies to breach of contract\n\nclaims at all or that joint liability may be based on common injury alone. Under\n\neither assumption, if a claim’s validity were determined by whether the claimant\n\nreceived a damage award under a judgment, a defendant in multi-defendant cases\n\nwould resist reasonable settlements as long as possible in hopes other defendants\n\nwould settle and allow it to escape scot-free, despite its joint liability, if those\n\nsettlement sums exceed the damages caused. Settling defendants have no\n\ncontribution claim against the hold-out under either Chapter 32 or common law\n\nbecause the settlors are not judgment debtors. 13 Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Jinkins,\n\n739 S.W.2d 19, 22 (Tex. 1987)(Chapter 32); Austin Road Co. v. Pope, 147 Tex.\n\n\n12\n     Blizzard is actually a no-breach, not a “credit,” case. See n.8, supra.\n13\n  TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§32.001, 32.002 (contribution allowed only in tort actions for\n“a person against whom a judgment is rendered”); TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §33.002\n(Chapter 33 only applies to tort actions); Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Jinkins, 739 S.W.2d 19, 22\n(Tex. 1987)(settlor has no right to sue for contribution).\n\n\n                                                    20\n\f430, 216 S.W.2d 563, 564-65 (1949)(common law); see Cross-Appellants’ Brief\n\n19-21,48-51. Thus, the Architect’s suggested interpretation of Chapter 38\n\ndiscourages, rather than encourages, settlement of valid claims. For these reasons,\n\nneither the Architect’s authorities nor Osborne support a rule barring recovery of\n\nChapter 38 attorney’s fees if the settlement exceeding the damage award occurs\n\nduring rather than before trial.\n\n      4.     RLJ Met All the Statutory Requirements for Recovering\n             Its Attorney’s Fees.\n      RLJ met all of Chapter 38’s necessary conditions. It had a valid claim that\n\nwas unpaid more than thirty days after presentment and remained unpaid before\n\ntrial commenced.\n\n             a.     RLJ Had a Valid Claim.\n      A “valid” breach of contract claim requires: (1) a valid contract; (2) that the\n\nclaimant performed or was excused from performing; (3) that the defendant\n\nbreached which (4) damaged the claimant. Kleas v. Clark, Thomas & Winters,\n\nP.C., No. 03-12-00755-CV, 2013 WL 4516120, at *2 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 21,\n\n2013, pet. denied); C.W. 100 Louis Henna, Ltd. v. El Chico Rests. of Tex., L.P.,\n\n295 S.W.3d 748, 752 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, no pet.). The jury’s verdict\n\nremoves all doubt that RLJ’s claim was valid. (CR1126-27).\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f              b.     The Just Amount Owing Was Not Timely\n                     Tendered.\n       RLJ’s claim was first presented in August 2009, with further presentments\n\nof its claim in August 2010 and by April 6, 2011 letter. (3SCR37-38,4SCR___ 14).\n\nThe Architect did not respond to these presentments. (3SCR38). Assume arguendo\n\nthat the jury’s verdict was – as the Architect contended– for “indivisible” damages\n\nfor which the Architect and the Settling Defendants were jointly liable, RLJ did not\n\n– unlike the claimant in Osborne – settle for a total amount greater than the jury’s\n\ndamage award until during the 2014 trial, long after the claim was presented.\n\n(CR1080-81,1174,1710;7RR105-108). In that hypothetical case, the jury’s finding\n\nestablished that the “just amount owing” was $785,000 (CR1127) which was not\n\ntimely paid. Even if the one satisfaction rule applied, which it does not, that is all\n\nthat was necessary. “If a plaintiff meets the requirements of [the attorney’s fee\n\nstatute], [t]he [plaintiff] is entitled to attorney's fees. Karol v. Presido Enterprises,\n\nInc., 622 S.W.2d 638, 640 (Tex. App.—Austin 1981, no writ); see also Buckner\n\nGlass & Mirror Inc. v. T.A. Pritchard Co., 697 S.W.2d 712, 714 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 1985, no writ)(decided under post-1977 amendment to article\n\n\n\n\n14\n  Exhibits 5 and 6 to Amended Attorney’s Fees Affidavit were included in RLJ’s request for the\naccompanying motion to be included in the Clerk’s Record, but appear to have been omitted.\nRLJ is requesting supplementation to include them.\n\n\n                                             22\n\f2226). Thus, RLJ satisfied Chapter 38’s timing requirement regarding its valid\n\nclaim. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §38.002(3).15\n\n       5.      The Trial Court’s Reasoning Agreed With the\n               Legislature’s.\n       The Architect alleges that the trial court was “creat[ing] its own rule of law”\n\nby ruling based on the settlement’s timing. (Appellant’s Brief 15). To the contrary,\n\nthe trial court here correctly distinguished settlements before trial from those that\n\noccur during trial. (CR1439-41). The trial court was not legislating or improvising.\n\nIt simply analyzed the language of Chapter 38 more carefully than the Architect. 16\n\n       The Architect also attacks the trial court’s reasoning for treating attorney’s\n\nfees as damages. This criticism assumes attorney’s fees cannot be recovered or\n\nconsidered “part of the amount of the judgment” unless other damages are\n\nrecovered. (Appellant’s Brief 16). The Architect cites C& H Nationwide, Inc. v.\n\nThompson, 903 S.W.2d 315, 325-26 (Tex. 1994), and Ellis County State Bank v.\n\nKeever, 888 S.W.2d 790, 797n.13 (Tex. 1994), without mentioning they construe\n\n“amount of the judgment” in the pre-judgment interest statute, not Chapter 38.\n\nIndeed, “amount of the judgment” appears nowhere in Chapter 38.\n\n15\n   §38.002 also requires presentment and representation by counsel. It is undisputed that RLJ’s\nclaim was presented and it was represented by counsel. (3SCR31,37-38).\n16\n   Unlimited by findings or conclusions, the judgment must be upheld under any theory\nsupported by evidence. BMC Software Belgium, N.V. v. Marchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 794 (Tex.\n2002); Phillips v. Estate of Poulin, No. 03-05-00099-CV, 2007 WL 2980180, at *4 (Tex. App.—\nAustin Oct. 12, 2007, no pet.). The very letter ruling the Architect criticizes states that it does not\nlimit the ruling’s bases and incorporates previous admonitions to that effect. (CR1057,1437).\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f      Chapter 38 does not require recovery of damages under a judgment to\n\nauthorize attorney’s fees. Whether attorney’s fees are “damages” is beside the\n\npoint. It is still worth noting, however, the Legislature considered attorney’s fees as\n\n“damages” when it eliminated the “finally obtain judgment” requirement in 1977.\n\nThe Committee Report for the 1977 amendment states, “Even in a lawsuit\n\ninvolving a lot of money, the losing party in effect prevents the winner from\n\ngetting the full amount, because the winner must pay his attorney. Either way, it's\n\nnot right for a person to be deprived of his full damages from a wrongdoer.”\n\n(emphasis added; available from the Texas Legislative Reference Library at\n\nhttp://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/hroBillAnalyses/65-0/HB452.pdf;App.K).\n\n      RLJ was entitled to attorney’s fees. It met all of Chapter 38’s requirements.\n\nNothing further required RLJ to recover a judgment for damages to recover its\n\nattorney’s fees. The Architect cites no authority addressing the effect of post-trial\n\nsettlement credits. Authorities interpreting other statutes have no bearing on\n\nChapter 38. Even if they did, RLJ “prevailed.”\n\nB.    RLJ Was Assigned the Contract and the Cause of Action and\n      Had Standing to Sue.\n      On three separate occasions, the Architect has tried and failed to convince\n\ntwo different trial judges that RLJ could not sue because it did not have the\n\nnecessary consensual assignment of rights under the Architectural Contract.\n\n(CR220,1083-84). The outcome can be no different here.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      1.    RLJ Owned Both the Architectural Contract Rights and\n            Causes of Action of Action for Its Breach.\n      The Owner and the Architect were the original parties to the Architectural\n\nContract. (CR463;App.G). With the Architect’s consent, the Owner assigned to\n\nSouth Ausaircourt, L.P. (“Ausaircourt”) “all of [the Owner’s] interest … in and to\n\nthat certain Standard Form Agreement Between Owner and Architect … date[d] …\n\nJanuary 1, 2005 ….” (CR578;App.L). There is no dispute that the Owner\n\neffectively assigned its rights under the Architectural Contract to Ausaircourt.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief 19). The Architect does not question that Ausaircourt owned the\n\ncontract cause of action against it. (Appellant’s Brief 21). The Architect’s first\n\nchallenge to the trial court’s summary judgment is limited to whether Ausaircourt\n\neffectively and validly transferred the cause of action to RLJ. (Appellant’s Brief\n\n19,28).\n\n            a.    Ausaircourt Assigned the Contract to RLJ Under\n                  the PSA and the Cause of Action By Assignment of\n                  “Intangible Assets.”\n      After the Project was substantially completed, many properties, including\n\nthe Project, were contracted to be sold pursuant to a “New Hotels Purchase and\n\nSale Agreement” (“PSA”). (CR605-676). Under the PSA, the Owner sold\n\nAusaircourt “all contracts, agreements … and warranties covering the design,\n\ndevelopment, construction, operations, maintenance and repair of the Property….”\n\n(CR 613[“Assets” defined];615[“Contracts” defined]; 619[“Property” defined];\n\n\n                                       25\n\f621[sales agreement]; App.J). At closing, Ausaircourt assigned RLJ “all of\n\n[Ausaircourt]’s right, title and interest in and to all licenses, permits and all other\n\nintangible assets relating to the [Project]….” (CR701; emphasis added; App.M).\n\n(“Intangibles Assignment”).\n\n      RLJ has a clear chain of ownership from Ausaircourt through the PSA and\n\nIntangibles Assignment of both the Architectural Contract and the cause of action.\n\nUnder the PSA’s authorization for supplemental documentation effecting the\n\ntransaction (CR656), a later “Supplemental Clarification of Assignment”\n\n(“Supplemental”) specified the Intangibles Assignment “intended to assign”\n\nAusaircourt’s rights in the Architectural Contract “along with all intangibles,\n\nincluding but not limited to causes of action or claims owned by [Ausaircourt]\n\nagainst [the Architect].” (CR602-04; emphasis added; App.N).\n\n      2.     The Intangibles Assignment Transferred the Contract\n             Cause of Action.\n      The plain language of the Intangibles Assignment conveyed the cause of\n\naction to RLJ. Assignments are construed like any contract through rules of\n\nconstruction to ascertain the parties’ intent expressed in the written assignment.\n\nCommercial Structures and Interiors, Inc. v.

App.—Austin Apr. 30, 2015, no pet. h.), that “Intangible\n\nproperty” includes “incorporeal property (as choses in action) often evidenced by\n\ndocuments (as stocks, bonds, notes, judgments, franchises) having no intrinsic\n\nvalue or by rights of action, easements, goodwill, trade secrets.” Accord, In re\n\nMalacara, 223 S.W.3d 600, 602 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2007, no pet.)(retirement\n\nbenefits); In re Fleckenstein, 589 S.W.2d 788, 789-90 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso\n\n1979, no writ)(promissory note). Thus, “intangible asset” and “intangible property”\n\nare commonly understood to include causes of action. Green v. H. E. Butt Found.,\n\n217 F.2d 553, 554 (5th Cir. 1954)(constructive possession of a chose in action); In\n\nre Grotjohn, No. 03-47055DML, 2005 WL 6441386, at *5 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. July\n\n19, 2005)(“Intangible assets such as … causes of action”); In re Scott, 157 B.R.\n\n297, 314 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1993), withdrawn per settlement, 162 B.R. 1004\n\n(Bankr. W.D. Tex. Jan. 21, 1994)(party succeeded to “intangible assets like causes\n\nof action”).\n\n               b.   The Architect’s Argument Ignores Context and the\n                    Residuary Clause’s Purpose.\n      The Architect’s declaration that there is “[n]o authority … causes of action\n\nare included within ‘intangible assets’” is incorrect. (Appellant’s Brief 26). The\n\nArchitect’s only cited support, an old edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, defines\n\n\n                                        28\n\f“asset” as “[p]roperty of all kinds, real and personal, tangible and intangible,\n\nincluding … causes of action….” Black’s Law Dictionary 117 (6th ed.\n\n1990)(emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Architect argues that omission of “cause\n\nof action” from the examples of “intangible asset” means it is not one. Having\n\nalready described “cause of action” as an “asset,” the dictionary’s failure to repeat\n\nit as an example of an “intangible asset” does not support the Architect’s\n\nconclusion. Presumably, the dictionary reasonably assumed readers would\n\nunderstand that a “cause of action” is intangible property and that example lists are\n\nnot exhaustive. The Architect points to the dictionary’s inclusion of “judgment” or\n\n“claim” as examples of a “nominal asset” to suggest that they cannot be intangible\n\nassets. Nothing indicates that “intangible” and “nominal” assets are mutually\n\nexclusive. The parties did not incorporate any such distinction. The Architect may\n\nnot now urge interpreting the assignments as if they had.\n\n      The Architect’s narrow definition of “intangible asset” also ignores its\n\ncontext. In construing assignments, the courts consider the surrounding\n\ncircumstances. Coffin v. Douglas, 61 Tex. 406, 409 (1884)(available at 1884 WL\n\n8785). Here, the parties were closing the sale of the Project. They intended RLJ to\n\nstep into Ausaircourt’s shoes. The PSA required the transfer of all Ausaircourt’s\n\nclaims and causes of action concerning the Project. (CR692). The PSA provides\n\nspecifically that Ausaircourt must cooperate with RLJ to enforce “any rights under\n\n\n                                         29\n\fthe [A]rchitectural [Contract] … respecting the design … and construction of the\n\nHotel.” (CR643;App.J). Thus, RLJ “bargained for an assignment of the prior\n\nowner’s possible causes of action … that occurred before [its] purchase.”\n\nBoerschig v. Southwestern Holdings, Inc., 322 S.W.3d 752, 767 (Tex. App.—El\n\nPaso 2010, no pet.).\n\n      Under the Intangibles Assignment, the transfer of “all other intangible\n\nassets” (CR701;App.M; emphasis added) is a residue or “Mother Hubbard” clause\n\nintended to convey any categorical item not otherwise assigned. This Court\n\nrecognizes such clauses clearly intend to dispose of all of one’s property. Petsch v.\n\nSlator, 573 S.W.2d 849, 853 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The\n\nsame is true here.\n\n      “The language used [in the Intangibles Assignment] is as broad as it well\n\ncould be.” Coffin, 61 Tex. at 409 (effect of assigning “all properties of all kinds\n\nowned by us”). “All means all,” Halliburton, Inc. v. Admin. Review Bd., 771 F.3d\n\n254, 266 (5th Cir. 2014); Kennedy v. Lynd, 306 F.2d 222, 230 (5th Cir. 1962), not\n\n“all, but” or “all, except.” Ausaircourt could not express more definitively that it\n\nconveyed all, and reserved no, intangible asset. The Architect’s narrow and self-\n\nserving assignment interpretation cannot be reconciled with surrounding\n\ncircumstances, the parties’ manifest intent, controlling interpretive rules, or its own\n\ndictionary’s definition of “asset.”\n\n\n                                          30\n\f      3.    The Intangibles Assignment was “Express.”\n      Notwithstanding the explicit assignment of “all ... intangible assets”\n\n(CR701;App.M), the Architect argues that something more “express” – by which\n\nthe Architect means “more particular” – was required. (Appellant’s Brief 22) This\n\nargument relies on cases about whether wording in a real property deed also\n\neffectively assigns an accrued cause of action for damage to the real estate\n\nconveyed. The courts, quite logically, have said “no.” The cause of action is not a\n\nright that “runs with the land.” Welch v. Monroe, No. 10-03-00013-CV, 2004 WL\n\n2474504, at *2 (Tex. App.—Waco Nov. 3, 2004, no pet.); Exxon Corp. v. Pluff, 94\n\nS.W.3d 22, 27 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2002, pet. denied). Once accrued, the claim is\n\nthe personal property of the owner at that time. Exxon Corp. v. Emerald Oil & Gas\n\nCo., L.C., 331 S.W.3d 419, 424-25 (Tex. 2010); Vann v. Bowie Sewerage Co., 127\n\nTex. 97, 90 S.W.2d 561, 562 (1936)(permanent nuisance).\n\n      Not being a real property right, “mere transfer of the land by deed does not\n\ntransfer the [accrued] claim for damages.” Emerald Oil, 331 S.W.3d at 420, 424-\n\n25; Vann, 90 S.W.2d at 563. Without a more specific reference, Emerald Oil, 331\n\nS.W.3d at 424-25, the accrued cause of action is not conveyed by a general\n\nwarranty deed’s grant of the described real estate and all “rights and appurtenances\n\nthereto.” Richey v. Stop N Go Markets of Tex., 654 S.W.2d 430, 431 (Tex.1983).\n\nAssignment of the cause of action cannot be implied because a general warranty\n\n\n\n                                        31\n\fdeed contains no language manifesting an intention to convey personal property.\n\nSee Brooks v. Chevron USA Inc., No. 13-05-029-CV, 2006 WL 1431227, at *8\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi May 25, 2006, pet. denied)(mem. op.); Pluff, 94\n\nS.W.3d at 27; Cook v. Exxon Corp., 145 S.W.3d 776, 781 (Tex. App.—Texarkana\n\n2004, no pet.); La Tierra de Simmons Familia, Ltd. v. Main Event Entm't, LP, No.\n\n03-10-00503-CV, 2012 WL 753184 at * (Tex. App.—Austin Mar. 9, 2012, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      Unlike the parties in the Architect’s cases, RLJ need not rely on the real\n\nproperty deed for its right to sue. It has express assignments of the seller’s personal\n\nproperty and intangible property. Cf. Ceramic Tile Int’l Inc. v. Balusek, 137\n\nS.W.3d 722, 724 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2004, no pet.)(plaintiff’s claim for\n\ndamage to real property failed due because separate assignment not introduced).\n\nYet, the Architect relies on Richey to argue that more particularity is necessary for\n\nthe cause of action’s assignment to be “express.” “Express” is the opposite of\n\n“implied.” Mueller v. All-Temp Refrig., Inc., 2014 Ohio 2718, ¶ 45; Ross v. Ross,\n\n20 Ala. 105, 111 (1852). RLJ need not resort to implication because the\n\nassignment to it was overtly expressed. Richey says nothing about particularity. It\n\nonly holds that a general warranty deed’s conveyance of described real property\n\n“with all … rights and appurtenances” does not include personal property\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\fconsisting of an accrued land damage cause of action. 654 S.W.2d at 431-32; see\n\nEmerald Oil, 331 S.W.3d at 425; Brooks, 2006 WL 1431227, at *8.\n\n      The Richey cases also do not suggest that a categorical description is\n\nineffective to describe everything within that category. General, categorical\n\ndescriptions are effective for that purpose. See, e.g., Owen v. Vibrasonic\n\nExploration, Inc., 694 S.W.2d 421, 424 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1985,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.)(“accounts receivable” … “including but not limited to those\n\nshown” sufficient to describe unlisted account); Ian Martin, Inc. v. Greenspoint\n\nBank, 01-87-00631-CV, 1988 WL 45423 at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\nMay 5, 01-87-00631-CV, 1988 WL 45423 (Tex. App. May 5, 1988)(same;\n\nunpublished); Orix Credit Alliance, Inc. v. Omnibank, N.A., 858 S.W.2d 586 (Tex.\n\nApp. 1993)(“property of every kind and nature” satisfied TEX. BUS. & COMM.\n\nCODE §9.110’s “reasonably identified” requirement for a lien on all tangible\n\nproperty). The Architect cites, and research reveals, no authority invalidating a\n\ncause of action’s assignment because it conveyed an encompassing class of\n\nintangible rights without specifically mentioning “cause of action” or “chose in\n\naction.” Merely because an accrued cause of action does not automatically pass\n\nwith a real property conveyance or the underlying contract’s assignment does not\n\njustify a “magic words” test that ignores that assignments like any other contract\n\nmust be construed according to its language in light of surrounding circumstances.\n\n\n                                       33\n\fCommercial Structures, 192 S.W.3d at 832-33. RLJ was validly assigned\n\nAusaircourt’s ownership of the cause of action against the Architect on the basis of\n\nthe Intangibles Assignments alone.17\n\n       4.     The Supplemental Clarification May Be Considered and\n              Removes Any Doubt That RLJ Was Assigned the\n              Architectural Contract and the Cause of Action For Its\n              Breach.\n       The propriety of the trial court’s ruling RLJ had standing is confirmed by\n\nconsidering the Supplemental’s statement the Intangibles Assignment was intended\n\nto include the Architectural Contract and “causes of action or claims … against the\n\n[Architect].” (CR603;App.N). The Architect suggests, however, the Supplemental\n\ncannot be considered because the trial court sustained its extrinsic parol evidence\n\nobjection. (Appellant’s Brief 27).\n\n       The parol evidence rule is a substantive, not evidentiary, so this ruling can\n\nbe reconsidered de novo. Hubacek v. Ennis State Bank, 159 Tex. 166, 169, 317\n\nS.W.2d 30, 31 (1958)(parol evidence substantive); Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co.\n\nv. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2003)(summary judgment reviewed de novo).\n\nThe parol evidence rule only precludes enforcement of inconsistent prior or\n\ncontemporaneous agreements if the parties have a fully integrated agreement.\n\nHubacek, 317 S.W.2d at 31; Lewis v. Adams, 979 S.W.2d 831, 836 (Tex. App.—\n\n17\n   The Architect devotes considerable discussion to the trial court’s April 10, 2014 letter.\n(Appellant’s Brief 22). The trial court did not limit the underpinnings for its ruling to the\nreasoning in its letter. See n. 16, supra.\n\n\n                                             34\n\fHouston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet)(only excludes prior agreements). The\n\nSupplemental was not parol evidence for at least four reasons.\n\n      First, assuming arguendo that intent was not, as the Architect contends,\n\nexpressed with sufficient particularity, the Supplemental was consistent with the\n\nintent to convey causes of action as a subset of the “intangible assets” expressly\n\nconveyed. All the Supplemental did was provide more particularity; it did not alter\n\nand was not inconsistent with the intent originally expressed. Second, the\n\nSupplemental was not parol evidence because it did not antedate the PSA or the\n\nIntangibles Assignment. Third, the assignment was not fully integrated. Indeed, the\n\nPSA authorized the execution of any necessary additional instruments and\n\npermitted its modification in writing. (CR654,656;App.J).\n\n      Finally and ironically, the Architect has no standing to assert the parol\n\nevidence rule. The Architect is a stranger to both the Intangibles Assignment and\n\nthe PSA. The parol evidence rule does not apply to a dispute between a contracting\n\nparty and a contractual stranger. Baroid Equipment, Inc. v. Odeco Drilling, Inc.,\n\n184 S.W.3d 1, 13 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). The\n\nSupplemental was appropriate for consideration despite the trial court’s erroneous\n\n“evidentiary” ruling and fully supports its decision that RLJ had standing through\n\nthe Intangibles Assignment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        35\n\f       5.     Alternatively, The PSA Transferred The Contract Cause\n              of Action When It Transferred the Contract.\n       If more than the Intangibles Assignment were required to transfer the cause\n\nof action, it is found in the PSA. It transferred all of Ausaircourt’s “right, title and\n\ninterest” to “the Assets,” which included “all contracts, agreements … and\n\nwarranties     covering     the    design,    development,       construction,     operations,\n\nmaintenance and repair of the Property….” (CR613,615,619;App.J). This clearly\n\nintended and effectuated an assignment of the Architectural Contract rights. The\n\nPSA’s assignment of all “right, title, and interest” in that contract includes the\n\ncause of action for its breach. See D Design Holdings, L.P. v. MMP Corp., 339\n\nS.W.3d. 195, 202-203 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.)(pre-suit assignment of\n\n“all of right, title, and interest” left no cause for the assignor to assert); see also\n\nEffel v. McGarry, 339 S.W.3d 789, 792 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied) (all\n\ninterests in assigned judgment, “including the underlying claim,” was assigned).\n\n       6.     The Architectural Contract Was Validly Assigned to\n              RLJ.\n       The Architect next argues that the Architectural Contract’s Anti-Assignment\n\nClauses invalidated the transfer of rights under that contract. Notably, the\n\nArchitect does not assert these clauses affected assignment of the cause of action. 18\n\n\n18\n   The Architect’s consent was unnecessary to assign the cause of action. Causes of action are\nfreely alienable, subject to exceptions inapplicable here. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v\nGandy, 925 S.W.2d 696, 707 (Tex. 1996); see TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 2.210(b) (West\n2011)(contract actions). Anti-assignment clauses do not prevent assignments of causes of action.\n\n                                              36\n\fAssignment of the cause of action was conclusively established under either the\n\nIntangibles Assignment or the PSA which makes irrelevant the Architect’s\n\narguments about the Architectural Contract’s assignment. Nevertheless, the\n\nArchitect’s challenge to the contract assignment is refuted here.\n\n       First, the Architect inaccurately asserts that RLJ admitted “alleg[ing] only an\n\nassigned cause of action … rather than assignment of the [Architectural] Contract\n\nitself.” (Appellant’s Brief 18,n.9). Yet the cited portion of RLJ’s pleading states\n\n“Ausaircourt assigned the Project, the contracts, … intangibles … and causes of\n\naction to [an] RLJ [entity].… and then assigned its rights … under the Project\n\ncontracts to … RLJ.” (CR222,329). This is no admission RLJ was not assigned the\n\ncontract, but simply acknowledges the PSA and Intangibles Assignments were\n\nseparate instruments.\n\n       Additionally, even if contract assignment had been proscribed by the anti-\n\nassignment clause, Ausaircourt’s transfer of the Architectural Contract to RLJ\n\nremained effective. “[T]he obligor a right to damages for breach of the terms\n\nforbidding assignment but [its breach] does not render the assignment ineffective.”\n\n\n\nPagosa Oil & Gas LLC v. Marrs & Smith Ptnrs., 323 S.W.3d 203, 212 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n2010, pet. denied); see also Restatement (Second) of Contract §§322(1), (2)(a). Other\njurisdictions agree that the AIA anti-assignment clause does not require consent to assign a cause\nof action. See e.g. Berschauer/Phillips Const. Co. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 881 P.2d 986\n(Wash. 1994); Ford v. Robertson, 739 S.W.2d 3, 5 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987)(post-performance\nassignment of cause of action); Folgers Architects Ltd. v.

Sup.Ct. 1983).\n\n      Some jurisdictions hold that if the assignor has fully performed, as is the\n\ncase here, the anti-assignment is unenforceable absent significant resulting harm.\n\nIn re Cooper, 242 B.R. 767, 771 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 1999); Gallagher v. Southern\n\nSource Packaging, LLC, 564 F.Supp.2d 503, 506-508, 514, 515 (E.D.N.C.\n\n2008)(assigment not barred if payment only performance due); Owen v. CNA\n\nInsurance/Continental Cas. Co., 167 N.J. 450, , 771 A.2d 1208, 1213-14, 1218\n\n(N.J. Super. 2001)(no material increase in risk or burden). In Berschauer/Phillips\n\nConst. Co. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 881 P.2d 986 (Wash. 1994), the court\n\nobserved that “[t]he primary purpose of clauses prohibiting the assignment of\n\ncontract rights without … permission is to protect him [or her] in selecting the\n\npersons with whom he [or she] deals.” 811 P.2d at 830 (citing Portland Elec. &\n\nPlumbing Co. v. Vancouver, 627 P.2d 1350 (1981)). Thus, the anti-assignment\n\n\n                                       38\n\fclause, if enforceable at all, did not invalidate the PSA’s assignment of the\n\nArchitectural Contract.\n\nC.    The Contract Was Admissible and Authenticated.\n      The Architect next complains the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nadmitting the Architectural Contract in evidence because the contract was (1)\n\ninadmissible hearsay and (2) not properly authenticated. (Appellant’s Brief 31-32).\n\nBoth complaints are meritless. A contract has legal effect independent of the truth\n\nof any statements therein. Rockwall Commons Assocs. Ltd. v. MRC Mortgage\n\nGrantor Trust I, 331 S.W.3d 500, 511 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, no pet.).\n\n      Statements that constitute offer, acceptance or terms of a contract—\n      so-called “operative facts”—are not hearsay[. M]erely making of such\n      statements are in themselves relevant and thus evidence that such\n      statements were made is not barred by the hearsay rule.\n\nThomas C. Cook, Inc. v. Rowhanian, 774 S.W.2d 679, 685 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n1989, writ denied); see also Sanders v. Worthington, 382 S.W.2d 910, 915–16\n\n(Tex.1964). The Architect is simply wrong when, without supporting authority, it\n\nasserts otherwise. The trial court correctly overruled the Architect’s hearsay\n\nobjection. (4RR8-9).\n\n      The Architect’s complaint about authentication fares no better. Texas Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 93(7) requires a verified denial to contest the execution of any\n\nwritten instrument on which any pleading is wholly or partially founded. RLJ\n\nalleged the Architect “contracted for” and “breached the Architectural Contract”\n\n\n                                        39\n\f(CR189,192), making the Architectural Contract the bedrock for RLJ’s pleading.\n\nThe Architect having not made a sworn denial (CR33-34,47-48), Rule 93(7)\n\nmandated its “receipt in evidence as fully proved.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 93(7); see also\n\nAssociated Press v. Hicks Broad. Corp., No. C14-93-00066-CV, 1993 WL 495114,\n\nat *2 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 2, 1993, no writ)(unpublished);\n\nMethodist Hosps. v. Corporate Communicators, Inc., 806 S.W.2d 879, 882 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Dallas 1991, writ denied).\n\n      The Architect could hardly deny the authenticity of the Architectural\n\nContract. It defended on the provisions in, and founded its declaratory relief\n\nrequest based on, the Architectural Contract. (CR53,55;App.O). It attached the\n\nsame contract bearing the same date stamp and its Bates numbers to its live answer\n\nand counterclaim. (Compare CR59-79;App.O with 12RR26-46;App.G). The\n\nArchitect supported its summary judgment motions with the Architectural Contract\n\n(CR90-91,100-120,262-63,265,278-300), calling it an “undisputed fact” that the\n\nArchitect “performed its services on the Project under” that instrument. (CR91). Its\n\ncounsel represented during trial that “Plaintiffs' Exhibit 15 … is a copy of the\n\nESG/White Lodging contract for this project.” (5RR134). The trial court could and\n\npresumably did take judicial notice of this instrument filed in its records. See TEX.\n\nR. EVID. 201(b); Office of Pub. Util. Counsel v. P.U.C., 878 S.W.2d 598, 600 (Tex.\n\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\f1994). On that basis alone, the contract was sufficiently authenticated. Associated\n\nPress, 1993 WL 495114, at *3.\n\n      The same contract was also proved a business record by the Architect’s vice-\n\npresident. (CR178,316). Such proof also authenticated the contract. TEX. R. EVID.\n\n901(10). For all these reasons, the trial court correctly overruled the hearsay and\n\nauthentication objections.\n\nD.    The Trial Court Did Not Err in Submitting the Contractual\n      Liability Issue Concerning Structural Engineering and The\n      Architect’s Complaints Have Not Been Preserved For Review.\n      The Architect complains of the jury submission of its liability for “fail[ure]\n\nto comply with the Architectural Contract regarding the structural engineering\n\nservices” (CR1126) “because RLJ did not plead or prove any theory of respondeat\n\nsuperior or vicarious liability against [it] for the [Structural Engineer’s] services.”\n\n(Appellant’s Brief 33). Though the Architect agreed its “services would ‘include’\n\nstructural engineering services” (12RR39,47-50;App.G), it now argues that without\n\npleading and proof of vicarious or respondeat superior liability, it has no\n\nresponsibility for the Structural Engineer’s work. (Appellant’s Brief 33).\n\n      1.     The Architect Waived Its Complaint By Failing to\n             Specially Except to the Omission of Vicarious or\n             Respondeat Superior Allegations.\n      Vicarious or respondeat superior liability is, as explained below,\n\nunnecessary. The Architect assumed in the Architectural Contract direct\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\fresponsibility to the Owner to provide structural engineering services.\n\n(12RR39,47-50;App.G) RLJ did not need to rely on any warranty concerning\n\nstructural engineering because reasonable performance is implied in every\n\ncontractual undertaking. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Scharrenbeck, 146 Tex. 153,\n\n204 S.W.2d 508, 510 (1947). Even if such derivative liability theories had been\n\nnecessary, the Architect cannot predicate its current complaint on its non-specific\n\n“no evidence” charge objection. The trial court is only required to submit the\n\n“questions, instructions and definitions … raised by the pleadings and the\n\nevidence.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 278(emphasis added). A party is only required to prove\n\nwhat it pleads. See Alaniz v. Jones & Neuse, Inc., 907 S.W.2d 450, 452 (Tex.\n\n1995)(no questions permitted regarding unpleaded issues). Unalleged facts\n\nessential to liability need not be proved unless the opponent specially excepts to\n\nthe omission. TEX. R. CIV. P. 90; Shoemake v. Fogel, Ltd., 826 S.W.2d 933, 937\n\n(Tex.1992). RLJ alleged the Architect “agreed to … provide … structural\n\nengineering design … for the Project” (CR44) and “breached the Architectural\n\nContract by … failing to produce design plans free from defects.” (CR47). The\n\nArchitect never specially excepted to failure to allege vicarious or respondeat\n\nsuperior liability. Therefore, RLJ was not required to prove either theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f      2.     The Architect Waived Its Complaint By Failing to File a\n             Verified Denial of Liability in the Capacity Sued.\n      The Architect also now denies direct contractual liability, asserting instead\n\nthat it is only vicariously liable for its Structural Engineer. The Architect alleged\n\ngenerally it did nothing that harmed RLJ, and any of RLJ’s damages were caused\n\nby “others for whose conduct [the Architect is] not legally responsible.” (CR48\n\n¶¶D.1, 2;App.O). This is a contest to liability in the capacity sued, which the\n\nArchitect was required, but failed, to plead by verified denial. TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n93(2). Leggett v. Brinson, 817 S.W.2d 154, 158 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1991, no\n\nwrit)(defendant sued individually for DTPA violations waived defense that he was\n\nonly acting as agent for another without a verified denial); Avanti Servs. Inc. v.\n\nQuestor Drilling, Inc., No. 01-86-00741-CV, 1987 WL 8352, at *2 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] Mar. 26, 1987, no writ)(unpublished; same for corporate\n\ncontract signatory sued for direct contract liability with no verified plea that it only\n\nsigned as agent for another). The Architect’s general, unverified denial of causing\n\nany of RLJ’s damages does not preserve its current complaint about its liability for\n\nthe Structural Engineer’s defective design. See Butler v. Joseph's Wine Shop, Inc.,\n\n633 S.W.2d 926, 929-30 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd\n\nn.r.e.)(unverified denial of action in individual capacity waived capacity defense).\n\nWithout a sworn denial, the Architect waived its complaint. See Horton v.\n\nRobinson, 776 S.W.2d 260, 266–267 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1989, no writ).\n\n\n                                          43\n\f      3.     The Architect Failed to Preserve Its Charge Complaint\n             By Objecting On Different Grounds Than Those Now\n             Urged.\n      At the charge conference, the Architect’s only objection to the structural\n\nengineering liability question was “there is no evidence to support [liability for]…\n\nfailure to comply with the [A]rchitectural [C]ontract regarding structural\n\nengineering services.” (9RR152). This objects to whether there was probative\n\nevidence the Architect failed to comply. The Architect’s complaint now concerns\n\nevidence supporting the Architect’s responsibility for the Structural Engineer’s\n\nfailure to comply. Objection on one ground preserves no error on another. State\n\nDep't of Highways & Pub. Transp. v. Payne, 838 S.W.2d 235, 242 (Tex. 1992).\n\nThe Architect waived its objection to the submission of the structural engineering\n\nliability question for this additional reason.\n\n      4.     Vicarious or Respondeat Superior Liability Is Not\n             Required When Responsibility Exists Under a Contract.\n      The substance of the Architect’s argument is also meritless. The Architect\n\nrelies on Ryan v. Morgan Spear Associates Inc., 546 S.W.2d 678, 681–82 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.—Corpus Christi 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.), for its vicarious/respondeat\n\nsuperior liability argument. That reliance is misplaced.\n\n             a.     Ryan Decided Tort, Not Contractual, Duty Under\n                    a Now-Rejected Liability Theory.\n      The Architect acknowledges the Ryan plaintiff contended the liability\n\ninquiry should have been based on whether the architect “breached its contractual\n\n                                           44\n\fduty to prepare plans and specifications free from defect.” (Appellant’s Brief\n\n35;emphasis added). It fails to mention, however, that the Ryan court never\n\nreached contractual duty question by ruling “liability … can only be sustained on\n\nproof that [the architect] was negligent….” 19 Id. at 682 (emphasis added). For 24\n\nyears since Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. DeLanney, 809 S.W.2d 493, 494–95\n\n(Tex. 1991), damages to the contract’s subject must be recovered in contract, not\n\ntort, actions. CBI NA-CON, Inc. v. UOP Inc., 961 S.W.2d 336, 340 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. denied). Ryan antedated DeLanney and only\n\naddresses the architect’s tort duty. It does not resolve the situation here: whether\n\ncontractual liability may be imposed for breach of a duty the architect’s agreement\n\nto provide structural engineering services. (CR68,72-73).\n\n              b.      The Contract Defines Contractual Duties.\n       As this Court recognized in Black + Vernooy Architects v. Smith, 346\n\nS.W.3d 877, 882 (Tex. App.—Austin 2011, pet. denied), an architect’s duties are\n\ncontractually defined. Accord Guirey, Srnka & Arnold, Architects v. Phoenix, 9\n\nAriz. App. 70, 449 P.2d 306 (1969); Moundsview ISD v. Buetow & Assoc., 253\n\nN.W.2d 836 (Minn.1977); Getzschman v. Miller Chem. Co., 232 Neb. 885, 898-99,\n\n443 N.W.2d 260, 270 (1989); Kelly v. Northwest Community Hospital, 66\n\n\n19\n  After obtaining summary judgment that RLJ could not recover in negligence pursuant to the\ndoctrine of equitable subrogation (CR1708), the Architect now seeks liability insulation under\nlaw only applicable to liability for negligence.\n\n\n                                               45\n\fIll.App.3d 679, 23 Ill.Dec. 466, 384 N.E.2d 102 (1978). Here, the Architect had a\n\ndirect duty to provide structural engineering services by contracting to do so. Proof\n\nof vicarious or respondeat superior liability was superfluous.\n\n      5.     The Architect Waived Any Complaint About the Duty\n             Submitted By Failing to Request Any Question,\n             Definition or Instruction.\n      Nevertheless, the Architect suggests under Ryan it should not be liable for\n\n“failure to comply with the Architectural Contract regarding the structural\n\nengineering services required” because it neither “guarantee[d]” quality nor\n\npromised “a perfect plan or satisfactory result.” (Appellant’s Brief 33, 34). Even if\n\nRyan had so constricted the Architect’s contractual duty, the Architect’s complaint\n\nis that the jury question incorrectly stated the liability standard. But the Architect\n\nrequested no question proposing any liability standard. (CR1119-20). Its own\n\nproposed bulk charge, on which it obtained no ruling, included no such liability\n\nstandard. (CR1108). It requested no definition or instruction submitting such a\n\nstandard. (CR1119-20). The Architect’s complaint was waived through these\n\nfailures. TEX. R. CIV. P. 279; Payne, 838 S.W.2d at 242.\n\n      6.     Ryan Only Addressed the Architect’s Direct, Not\n             Vicarious, Tort Liability.\n      The Architect also asserts that Ryan means a contract party may later\n\ndelegate its promised performance to one it unilaterally characterizes an\n\nindependent contractor and thereby elude liability without proof of respondeat\n\n\n                                         46\n\fsuperior. Respondeat superior, however, is only applicable to torts. It is based on\n\nthe theory the employer is liable for the employee’s negligence though the\n\nemployer itself beached no duty. St. Anthony's Hosp. v. Whitfield, 946 S.W.2d 174,\n\n178 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1997, writ denied); White v. Dennison, 752 S.W.2d\n\n714, 716 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988, writ denied); Marange v. Marshall, 402\n\nS.W.2d 236, 241–42 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1966, writ ref'd n.r.e.). It is\n\nunnecessary when the employer breaches a direct duty it contractually assumed.\n\nSee V.D.4.b., supra.\n\n      Because the Ryan plaintiff failed to request a charge question whether the\n\nengineer was the architect’s agent, 546 S.W.2d at 682, the only issue before the\n\ncourt was whether sufficient evidence supported the architect’s direct tort liability.\n\nId. at 681. The Architect’s suggestion that Ryan defines a contractual standard is\n\nincorrect. Even in negligence, an architect is not relieved of responsibility simply\n\nby hiring a consultant to discharge its professional responsibilities. Playskool, Inc.\n\nv. Elsa Benson, Inc., 147 Ill. App. 3d 292, 299, 497 N.E.2d 1199, 1204 (1986).\n\n      7.     Architect’s Reasoning Permits It All the Contractual\n             Benefits Free of Burden and Risk.\n      The Architect further uses Ryan to suggest that it is not contractually liable\n\nfor the Structural Engineer’s shortcomings because the contract between the\n\nArchitect and Structural Engineer provided the latter was an independent\n\ncontractor. (Appellant’s Brief 33). The Owner was not a party to that agreement.\n\n\n                                         47\n\fIts rights are unaffected by such a contract. See Prize Energy Res., L.P. v. Cliff\n\nHoskins, Inc., 345 S.W.3d 537, 554 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, no pet.). The\n\nlack of privity between construction subcontractors and owners is why it was\n\nnecessary to devise the “pass-through” fiction based on the general contractor’s\n\nprivity with the owner to permit subcontractors to sue owners for breaches.\n\nInterstate Contracting Corp. v. City of Dallas, 135 S.W.3d 605, 615 (Tex. 2004).\n\n      The Architect in this case was, however, a party to the contract under which\n\nit agreed to perform structural engineering services. It was free to contract with the\n\nStructural Engineer for indemnity or other protections. No matter how it chose to\n\narrange the Structural Engineer’s performance, the Architect was contractually\n\nanswerable to the Owner and its assigns for the breach. The Architect’s vicarious-\n\nonly argument overlooks the same principle the Architect espouses concerning the\n\nassignment: there is no privity; ergo, no contractual liability. If the remedy against\n\nthe Architect were limited to derivative liability, the Architect would be free to\n\ncontract for services completely free of liability for another’s failure to provide the\n\npromised performance.\n\n      8.     Illegality Is Not an Issue Due to The Architect’s Failure\n             to Plead It and Statutory Authorization for Architects\n             Performing Structural Engineering Services.\n      The Architect also argues that it cannot be liable for failings of its Structural\n\nEngineer because it “literally cannot agree to provide structural engineering\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fservices.” (Appellant’s Brief 36). It quotes Seaview Hospital, Inc. v. Medicenters\n\nof Am., Inc., 570 S.W.2d 35, 39 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1978, no writ),\n\nfor the proposition that “a contract for engineering services to be performed by a\n\nperson who is prohibited from practicing engineering in Texas is void and\n\nunenforceable.” (Appellant’s Brief 36).\n\n             a.    Any Illegality Was Waived Because It Is Not\n                   Apparent And The Architect Did Not\n                   Affirmatively Plead It.\n      Unenforceability due to alleged illegality is an affirmative defense that is\n\nwaived if not pleaded unless pleaded facts conclusively establish illegality. TEX. R.\n\nCIV. P. 94; Phillips v. Phillips, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex.1991); Park v. Escalera\n\nRanch Owners' Ass'n, Inc., No. 03-12-00314-CV, 2015 WL 737424, at *16 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin Feb. 13, 2015, no pet. h.). Even if it were a valid defense here,\n\nnothing pleaded showed the Architect was not licensed to or could not lawfully\n\nprovide engineering services. Failure to plead illegality waived any such defense.\n\n      There was no illegality defense to waive, however. Even if the contract\n\nviolated architecture regulations, the Architect could not assert it. Public policy\n\nwould not prevent contract enforcement against the Architect because of the need\n\nto discourage Architect’s from regulatory violations. Geis v. Colina Del Rio, LP,\n\n362 S.W.3d 100, 110 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, pet. denied). Further, there\n\nis no illegality. The Architect is authorized to prepare “engineering plans and\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fspecifications for … the depiction of the building systems, including structural,\n\nmechanical,    electrical,   and   plumbing     systems….”    TEX.    OCCUP.     CODE\n\n§1001.0031(d)(emphasis added).\n\n              b.    Seaview Hospital Does Not Say An Architect\n                    Cannot Provide Structural Engineering Services.\n      Finally, the Architect’s citation of and quotation ignores that Seaview\n\nHospital does not discuss the dividing line between architecture and engineering. It\n\ninvolved a contract under which a general contractor agreed to provide, not\n\nperform, those services under a turnkey contract. 570 S.W.2d at 38-39. The\n\ncontractor in fact arranged for those services through licensed professionals. It was\n\nthe owner-defendant, not the architect, asserting illegality. Seaview Hospital held\n\nthe contract should be interpreted to be enforceable; i.e., that the general contractor\n\nonly agreed to arrange for others to provide such services.\n\n      The Architect’s complaint cannot be sustained. The trial court did not\n\nreversibly err in submitting a jury question concerning the Architect’s failure to\n\nperform structural engineering services.\n\nE.    The Evidence of Diminution in Value Was Legally Sufficient.\n      The Architect’s last complaint is “[t]he evidence at trial was legally\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s $700,000 award of market value damages.”\n\n(Appellant’s Brief 36). This attack is limited to supporting evidence for the jury’s\n\n\n\n\n                                           50\n\ffinding of Project value difference “determined as of August 31, 2010.” (CR\n\n1127;App.B). The jury’s verdict, however, is fully supported.\n\n       1.     The Evidence Is Legally Sufficient If It Provides More\n              Than a Scintilla of Factual Support.\n       A finding is unsupported by legally sufficient evidence only if there is a\n\ncomplete absence of probative evidence; such evidence is not enough to cause\n\nreasonable, fair-minded people to differ; or its opposite is conclusively established.\n\nCity of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex.2005); Burroughs Wellcome\n\nCo. v. Crye, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499 (Tex.1995). A reviewing court may only\n\nconsider evidence supporting the verdict, viewing that evidence and inferences\n\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict. Mancorp, Inc. v. Culpepper,\n\n802 S.W.2d 226, 227 (Tex.1990). Even if an expert’s valuation lacks supportive\n\nmarket data, the opinion is more than a scintilla and sufficient to present a disputed\n\nfact issue.   Alleged data deficiency goes to persuasive, not probative, value. See\n\nMissouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co. v. City of Dallas, 623 S.W.2d 296, 299 (Tex. 1981).\n\nDamages are not denied for want of exactitude “[i]f an injured party has produced\n\nthe best evidence available… afford[ing] a reasonable basis for determining [the]\n\nloss.” Vance v. My Apartment Steak House of San Antonio, Inc., 677 S.W.2d 480,\n\n484 (Tex.1984); O and B Farms, Inc. v. Black, 300 S.W.3d 418, 422 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied)(evidence sufficient despite loss of\n\ndocuments necessary for precise calculation). Whatever the Architect’s quibbles\n\n\n                                         51\n\fabout the appraiser’s supporting data, his opinion is not facially conclusory. It has\n\nprobative value. See Houston Unlimited, Inc. Metal Processing v. Mel Acres\n\nRanch, 443 S.W.3d 820, 838 (Tex. 2014).\n\n      2.     Hornsby’s Testimony Was Well-Founded Based on Well-\n             Accepted Standards and Methodologies.\n      Real estate appraiser Paul Hornsby appropriately valued the Project on the\n\ndate the charge specified – August 31, 2010 (“Valuation Date”) – using the income\n\napproach under two different scenarios. “[T]he income approach … is appropriate\n\nwhen the property would, in the open market, be priced according to the income\n\nthat it already generates.” City of Harlingen v. Sharboneau, 48 S.W.3d 177, 183\n\n(Tex. 2001). This is how a buyer would value the Project. (7RR128). Hornsby’s\n\nmethodology complied with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal\n\nPractice (“USPAP”). (7RR116, 122-23).\n\n      Hornsby appraised thousands of Austin-area properties over 34 years\n\n(7RR114), including over 100 hotels. (7RR115). Hornsby performed two August\n\n31, 2010 valuations: one for the Project’s actual impaired condition after the\n\nremediation had been implemented; another had its condition not been impaired.\n\n(7RR116,122-23,175-177). As USPAP requires, Hornsby considered three\n\ncustomary valuation methods: cost, comparable sales, and income. (7RR121-22).\n\nHornsby looked primarily to the income approach, with comparable sales as a\n\nvouchsafe only. There was insufficient sales data for comparable sales to be\n\n\n                                         52\n\findependently reliable. (7RR142-43). Unless a hotel is brand new, the cost method\n\nis inappropriate. (7RR128).\n\n      To determine the Project’s income-based value on the appraisal date were it\n\nundamaged (“undamaged value”), Hornsby considered average daily room rate,\n\naverage occupancy rate, typical expenses, and capitalization rate from published\n\ndata for five other similar nearby hotels and the Project’s actual performance data\n\nthrough the Valuation Date. (7RR130-34). With necessary adjustments, Hornsby\n\nestimated that the undamaged Project would have a $100.00 average daily rate and\n\n70% average occupancy. (7RR134-40). He concluded that the income-based\n\nundamaged value of the Project was $13,650,000. (7RR141-42,44). Hornsby\n\nchecked that valuation against comparable sales. (7RR142-44).\n\n      Hornsby then used income to value the Project “as-is” as of the appraisal\n\ndate, assuming all feasible repairs were complete and recognizing their future\n\neffectiveness was uncertain (“damaged value”). (7RR144-45). Hornsby adjusted\n\nfor faster-declining room rates, no-growth occupancy rates, increased operating\n\nexpenses for the Project as-is compared to undamaged hotels. (7RR145-47). He\n\nalso adjusted the capitalization rate up from that for undamaged hotels because of\n\nthe higher return rate necessary to induce a buyer to take on the additional known\n\nfoundation risks with the Project. (7RR147-48). He concluded that the income-\n\nbased damaged value of the Project was $7,220,000. (7RR148). He could not test\n\n\n                                        53\n\fthis against comparable sales because there were no area sales of hotels in a similar\n\nstate. (7RR145). Hornsby’s diminution-in-value testimony was more than\n\nsufficient to support the jury’s verdict.\n\n       3.     The Architect’s Complaints Are Meritless.\n              a.     The Evidence Supported the Answer to the\n                     Question Asked, and the Architect Waived Its\n                     Valuation Date Complaint.\n       Without challenging any evidentiary ruling, the Architect asserts Hornsby’s\n\ntestimony could not support the verdict “because his valuations were determined as\n\nof the wrong date.” The Architect ignores the charge specifically instructed\n\ndamages should be determined “as of August 31, 2010” – the date of Hornsby’s\n\nvaluations.20 (CR1127). The evidence need only support the answer to the question\n\nasked. Osterberg v. Peca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 55 (Tex. 2000); see THPD, Inc. v. Cont’l\n\nImports, Inc., 260 S.W.3d 593, 608 (Tex.

Neither did\n\nit object to the question because of the date. (9RR153). Its objection was to\n\n“legal[ly] and factually insufficient evidence to support the damages question\n\ntendered, and we incorporate the motion for directed verdict arguments.” (Id.;\n\n20\n  In McGinty v. Hennen, 372 S.W.3d 625, 628 (Tex. 2012), and Barraza v.Koliba, 933 S.W.2d\n164, 169 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996, writ denied), do not apply here. There, the testimony\nand charge involved different valuation dates; here, the testimony and charge involved the same\nvaluation dates.\n\n\n                                              54\n\femphasis added). The objection to the “question tendered” was invalid because\n\nHornsby’s testimony supported the “question tendered” in the charge.\n\n      The attempted incorporation of “directed verdict arguments” added nothing.\n\nRule 274 is explicit that “[n]o objection to one part of the charge may be adopted\n\nand applied to any other part… by reference only” because “all participants… are\n\nentitled to know with certainty the that all objections have been made at the\n\ndesignated point….” Charles R. “Skip” Watson, Jr., “The Court's Charge to the\n\nJury,” Advanced Civil Trial Course 7–28 (State Bar of Texas 2003). Because this\n\ngoal is thwarted by incorporating charge objections by reference, objections to\n\ndefects in instructions that incorporate arguments in previous motions must also be\n\ndeemed waived because they are not “specifically included in the objections.” TEX.\n\nR. CIV. P. 274.\n\n      In addition, the Valuation Date submitted was appropriate in light of the\n\nacknowledged superiority of the “income approach” when the market values\n\nproperties like the Project according to its income. (7RR128-29). Sharboneau, 48\n\nS.W.3d at 183. By the Valuation Date, the Project’s operations had stabilized and\n\nprovided a more reliable income model, much of the possible repair work was\n\ncomplete, and the ramifications of the Project’s problems were more fully known.\n\n(7RR120,124-25). That date permitted appraisal by analysis, not speculation. An\n\n\n\n\n                                        55\n\fearlier date would have yielded inaccurate results because of uncertainty over the\n\nfull consequences of the Project’s problems. (7RR125-26).\n\n       This carefully tailored approach is precisely what cases involving breaches\n\nof design or construction contracts call for because measure of damages is\n\ngoverned by each case’s peculiar facts. Vance, 677 S.W.2d at 482. “What is a\n\nreasonable time is a question of fact, varied by the circumstances of each case.”\n\nBarry v. Jackson, 309 S.W.3d 135, 141 (Tex. App.—Austin 2010, no pet.)21. Yet,\n\nthe Architect offers and research revealed no authority that the Valuation Date is\n\nimproper for breach of a design contract for an income-producing property. The\n\nArchitect ignores the Vance directive and would superimpose a one-size-fits-all\n\nsolution by resort to a rigid-date approach used in real estate sales contract\n\nbreaches.\n\n       A date-of-sale valuation is appropriate for the breach of a real estate sales\n\ncontract because damages are based on a single value fixed at a definite time.\n\nBarry 309 S.W.3d at 140; accord Westminster Falcon/Trinity L.L.P. v.

Brookhollow, Inc.,\n\n642 S.W.2d 160, 164 (Tex. 1984); Gulf Ins. Co. v. Cunningham, A14-91-00799-\n\nCV, 1993 WL 136039, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Apr. 29, 1993, writ\n\ndenied).\n\n      Unlike breach of a sales contract, the consequences of contractual deviations\n\nin construction frequently do not become manifest until after the breach occurrs.\n\nThat was certainly true here because the damage to the Project resulting from the\n\nstructural design deficiencies were dynamic, not static, and continued to worsen as\n\ntime passed. (7RR117,126,144-45;4RR78-79). Thus, a rigid date-of-breach\n\napproach would often underestimate the value received in contractual breaches\n\ninvolving new construction.\n\n      Further, given the delay involved for latent defects to appear, assessing the\n\nhypothetical undamaged value must be postponed so that both it and damaged\n\nvalue are assessed under the same market conditions to avoid concerns about\n\nrapidly-fluctuating market conditions expressed in Barry and Naylor v. Stiegler,\n\n613 S.W.2d 546, 547 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1981, no writ). Otherwise, the\n\ncomparison ceases to be reliable for accurately measuring diminution. Unreliable\n\ndata is not a permissible basis for expert opinion. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v.\n\nHavner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 714 (Tex. 1997).\n\n\n                                        57\n\f      In addition, the Architect’s reliance on this Court’s observation in Barry\n\nabout the effect of the passage of time on the real estate market concerned\n\nvaluation based on sales, not income. 309 S.W.3d at 141. Thus, worries about lay\n\ntestimony that did not attempt to relate a later sale to the valuation date are absent\n\nhere. The valuation method here was different. The testimony was presented by an\n\nexpert who related his data to the Valuation Date. Hornsby eschewed the\n\nArchitect’s unreliable approach and used the charge’s Valuation Date to determine\n\nboth the damaged and undamaged value as precisely as circumstances permitted –\n\ni.e., after the issues had manifested and the remediation work was complete, even\n\nthough the Project could not be fully repaired. (7RR123-25,176-77).\n\n             b.    The Jury Was Provided With Actual Performance\n                   Data.\n      Having argued that the Valuation Date in the charge was too late, the\n\nArchitect also argues that it was not late enough. It contends Hornsby’s diminished\n\nvalue opinion was undermined because it was based on predicted data as of the\n\nvaluation date instead of actual performance data that only became available until\n\nafter the court’s charge’s specified valuation date. In fact, Hornsby testified about\n\nthe diminution in value based on both the actual, post-valuation performance data\n\nand the projections based on the data available on the valuation date. (7RR149-53.)\n\n      Hornsby informed the jury that based on actual performance, the Project’s\n\ndiminution in value was $4.3 million (7RR152); based on the data available as of\n\n\n                                         58\n\fthe valuation date, its diminution in value was $6.4 million. (7RR153). Thus, even\n\nif the Architect were right about the proper underpinnings for calculating value\n\ndiminution, the Architect’s legal sufficiency attack on this basis is meritless\n\nbecause the jury was given a valuation based on the actual performance data. Its\n\ndiminution finding as caused by the Architect’s breach was within the range of\n\ndiminution damages the evidence supports. See Gulf States Utilities Co. v. Low, 79\n\nS.W.3d 561, 566 (Tex. 2002).\n\n      Nonetheless, the Architect is wrong about using data unavailable on the\n\nValuation Date. USPAP standards disallow consideration of information the\n\nhypothetical buyer and seller not then know. (7RR149,152). Hornsby’s use of only\n\npre-valuation data was the correct methodology and his analysis was reliable. That\n\nis all that was required. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 581 (Tex.\n\n2006). The jury gets to resolve the weight to be given his opinion. See id.\n\nHornsby’s analysis is not unreliable under Whirlpool Corp. v. Camacho, 298\n\nS.W.3d 631, 640 (Tex. 2009), because his opinion based on pre-valuation data did\n\nnot disregard relevant facts as the experts in Whirlpool did.\n\n      Again, the Architect is complaining that a different date should have been\n\nasked without preserving that objection to the charge. For any and all of these\n\nreasons, this aspect of the Architect’s legal insufficiency argument is specious.\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\f             c.    There Was Legally Sufficient Evidence to Support\n                   the Jury’s Verdict and Any Allocation of Damages.\n      The Architect apparently argues Hornsby’s opinion cannot support the jury’s\n\nverdict because it was not limited to diminution caused by the Architect alone.\n\nThis argument is flawed in several of its premises.\n\n                   1)     The Architect Erroneously Assumes Jury\n                          Must Have Implicitly Found Others\n                          Breached.\n      It erroneously assumes the jury must have found other’s breaches caused\n\ndiminution damages. Such assumption violates the obligation to review evidence in\n\nthe most favorable light, ignoring all contrary evidence and inferences. City of\n\nKeller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex. 2005). The jury is entitled to\n\ndisbelieve any or all of expert or lay testimony. See McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722\n\nS.W.2d 694, 697 (Tex.1986). It could have believed the Architect’s breach of its\n\nstructural design obligation alone caused all the diminution in value.\n\n      There evidence supported that conclusion. An expert testified that\n\ninadequate foundation design caused foundation movement because it focused on\n\nload distribution, not resisting movement from soil expansion. (4RR87,90-92,111-\n\n12). The Soils Engineer correctly evaluated the Project site’s soil plasticity.\n\n(4RR114-117,119-122). The Architect was the center of the design team ultimately\n\nresponsible to see that the foundation design followed the Soils Engineer’s\n\nrecommendations. (5RR165-67,176,216-18,222-23).\n\n\n                                         60\n\f      The foundation design utilized was not the one the Soils Engineer\n\nrecommended (4RR122-23,185), and was not adequate for the Project site.\n\n(5RR57-58,96,217-18). The design was inappropriate because it did not properly\n\naddress resistance to movement from soil expansion. (4RR87-88,128-29). The\n\nGeneral Contractor was required to build the type of foundation specified, which it\n\ndid. (3RR159,157-58). This evidence supported any determination the Architect’s\n\nfailure to provide proper structural engineering alone would have caused value-\n\ndiminishing Project damage in the amount the jury found. The Architect’s\n\nsegregation complaint is academic.\n\n                   2)     Evidence of Unsegregated Damages Is\n                          Legally Sufficient Evidence of Segregated\n                          Damages.\n      Complaint about the legal insufficiency of the supporting damages evidence\n\nis procedurally and substantively invalid. Procedurally, the architect did not make\n\nclear that its objection was to lack of evidence of segregation or allocation. It only\n\ngenerally objected that there was legally insufficient evidence. See V.F.3.a., supra.;\n\ncf. Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Nishika Ltd., 953 S.W.2d 733, 738 (Tex.\n\n1997)(“objection pointed out distinctly the nature of 3M's complaint about the\n\ndamage question's form” sufficient).\n\n      Substantively, the legally insufficient evidence objection being asserted on\n\nappeal could not be sustained even had it been sufficiently particular. The Texas\n\n\n\n                                         61\n\fSupreme Court resolved this issue against the Architect in Nishika. 953 S.W.2d at\n\n978-79. There, four plaintiffs sued for breach of warranty and recovered lump-sum\n\ndamages. On appeal, two plaintiffs were disqualified from warranty protection.\n\nThe court rejected defendant’s argument for a take-nothing judgment because\n\ndamages evidence was not segregated for the remaining plaintiffs. It held that\n\nunsegregated damages evidence was legally sufficient evidence of segregated\n\ndamages. Accord, Stewart Title Guaranty Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Tex.\n\n1991)(attorney’s fees not limited to permissible claims); Texarkana Memorial\n\nHospital, Inc. v. Murdock, 946 S.W.2d 936, 840-41 (Tex. 1997)(damages not\n\nsegregated by liable defendant).\n\n                   3)     Testimony Segregating Damages Is Not\n                          Required.\n      The Architect is in effect challenging the jury’s ability to apportion\n\nresponsibility without expert guidance. The percentage responsibility cases,\n\nhowever, confirm that such allocations are routinely entrusted to juries without\n\nspecific allocation testimony, and that courts will not substitute their judgment for\n\nthe jury’s concerning that allocation.

App.—Austin\n\nApr. 9, 2009, pet. denied)(mem. op.). Allocation of damages caused among\n\nmultiple breaches is not subject to precise calculation.\n\n             d.    Comparable Sales Were a Vouchsafe, Not the\n                   Basis for Valuations.\n      The Architect confuses things again with its “comparable sales” method\n\nargument. (Appellant’s Brief 46). Hornsby did not calculate diminution in value\n\nbased on comparable sales. (7RR128). He calculated income-based valuations for\n\nthe “damaged” and hypothetical “undamaged” Project on the Valuation Date\n\n(7RR128-142), only using comparable sales to “test” his income-based valuations.\n\n(7RR142-43). Even if Hornsby had partially relied on comparable sales, it would\n\nnot invalidate his opinion.\n\n      [I]f the opinion should be shown to be based exclusively upon\n      considerations of incompetent factors, it would have to be\n      disregarded, ‘but, all opinion being at best something of a speculation,\n\n\n                                         63\n\f      it does not cease to have probative force when impropriety attaches\n      only to some, rather than all, of its underlying reasons. The question\n      of market value is thus peculiarly one for the fact finding body....’”\n\nTex. Pipe Line Co. v. Hunt, 149 Tex. 33, 228 S.W.2d 151, 156 (Tex. 1950).\n\nComparable sales were not the sole basis for or only methodology underlying the\n\nvaluations. Their incidental, confirmatory role did not rob Hornsby’s valuations of\n\nprobative value.\n\n      Even when an expert’s valuation is based on comparable sales, the trial court\n\nhas broad discretion whether “a sale is sufficiently similar to be admissible as a\n\ncircumstance influencing an expert witness in arriving at his opinion of value.” Id.\n\n(quoting Tex. Elec. Serv. Co. v. Graves, 488 S.W.2d 135, 139 (Tex. Civ. App.—El\n\nPaso 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The Architect has shown no such abuse. Comparable\n\nsales are generally admissible unless “reasonable minds cannot differ that the\n\nevidence of the other sale lacks probative force because of its dissimilarity….”\n\nCollin Cnty. v. Hixon Family P'ship, Ltd., 365 S.W.3d 860, 868 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2012, pet. denied) (quoting Bridges v. Trinity River Auth., 570 S.W.2d 50,\n\n56 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.)). Here, Hornsby followed\n\nUSPAP in utilizing sales comparisons (7RR143) and provided an explanation as to\n\nthe appropriateness of the comparisons. (7RR142-145).\n\n\n\n\n                                        64\n\f             e.    There Was No Recovery For “Stigma” Damages\n                   and No Double Recovery.\n      The Architect also reasons there was no evidence the Project was incapable\n\nof repair, so any diminution valuation necessarily included “stigma” damages.\n\nAgain, the Architect’s premise is flawed. “Stigma” or “fear” damages are those for\n\nreductions in property value due to the lingering perception or fear of a harmful\n\ncondition after it has been repaired or eliminated. Houston Unlimited, Inc. Metal\n\nProcessing v. Mel Acres Ranch, 389 S.W.3d 583, 594 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2012), rev'd on other grounds, 443 S.W.3d 820 (Tex. 2014). The damage\n\nhere is concrete reality, not anguished perception.\n\n      The factual flaw is that there was probative evidence that the foundation\n\ncould not be repaired. (4RR93,96-97). Thus, the question of diminution in value\n\nattributable solely to market risk/uncertainty intolerance for a non-existent\n\ncondition never arises. The foundation could not be strengthened or altered to\n\navoid ongoing movement. (4RR90-92,96-97). The best that could be accomplished\n\nwas to control soil expansion and resulting movement by limiting moisture\n\ninfiltration. (4RR90-97). The foundation problems would continue. The efficacy of\n\nthe repairs was uncertain. (Id.). Thus, market uncertainty was over an existing, not\n\nimagined, condition likely to cause future damage or deterioration. (Id.;7RR117,\n\n124,176-77). On that is required for value diminution. Precision Homes, Inc. v.\n\n\n\n\n                                         65\n\fCooper, 671 S.W.2d 924, 930 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd\n\nn.r.e.).\n\n       There is no double recovery when the jury awarded pre-Valuation Date\n\nrepair costs of repair for repairs plus Valuation Date value diminution. The latter\n\ntakes into account future repair costs. (7RR123-24,177-78). That is how Hornsby\n\ncalculated the damaged value. (Id.). Indeed, there is no duplication in comparing\n\npost-repair value to the hypothetical undamaged value on the same Valuation Date.\n\nSee Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 441 (Tex. 1995). The charge’s\n\ndamage question avoided any possibility of double recovery by limiting repair\n\ncosts to those incurred on or before the Valuation Date (CR1127;App.B), which\n\nwere not factored in to Hornsby’s valuation. Those that might have been incurred\n\nafter the valuation date were included in the diminished value as of the Valuation\n\nDate. There was no double recovery and no recovery for “stigma” damages.\n\n            f.     Lost Profits Were Not a Separate Element of\n                   Recovery, But Were Only Used As Necessary for\n                   the Texas Supreme Court’s Approved Method of\n                   Valuing Property Producing Income.\n       Hornsby’s income-based Project valuation utilized the method the Texas\n\nSupreme Court approved for income-producing property. Sharboneau, 48 S.W.3d\n\nat 183. “[E]stimating … future income and applying a capitalization rate … allows\n\nthe appraiser to arrive at a present value.” Id. The income method consists of\n\n“estimating the net operating income stream of a property and applying a\n\n\n                                        66\n\fcapitalization rate to determine the property’s present value.” State v. Bristol Hotel\n\nAsset Co., 293 S.W.3d 170, 171 (Tex. 2009).\n\n      Estimating future income necessarily includes modeling based on historical\n\nperformance, consultation with published figures available to appraisal\n\nprofessionals and estimates of future occupancy and room rates. (7RR129-30).\n\nHornsby used these resources to arrive at an overall valuation of the Hotel itself.\n\nThis is not a “lost profits” model and RLJ did not obtain damages for “lost profits,”\n\ndespite the Architect’s claims. None of the Architect’s evidentiary insufficiency\n\narguments are meritorious.\n\n                      VI.

Garcia*, Cain*, Ezzell,\n                  D. Hill*, Ribak*, Rudd\n        0 nays--\n        2 absent--Maloney, Jackson\nWITNESSES:     None\nDIGEST: Article 2226, Revised Civil Statutes, allows recovery of\n     attorney's fees (in addition to the basic claim) for certain\n     limited kinds of lawsuits. HB 452 expands Article 2226 so\n     that reasonable attorney's fees may be recovered in all suits\n     founded on oral or written contracts. The bill also exempts\n     certain insurance contracts and certain insurers from all\n     provisions of the article.\nPRO:     Expanding the recovery of attorney's fees would serve the ends\n        of justice. Generally, the winner in a lawsuit cannot make\n        the loser pay attorney's fees, unless there is a specific\n        authorization in the law or a contract with that provision.\n        Many times a person with a valid, but small, claim will not\n        bother to go to court because the lawyer's fees are almost\n        as much as the possible proceeds of the suit, sometimes more.\n            Even in a lawsuit involving a lot of money, the losing\n        party in effect prevents the winner from getting the full\n        amount, because the winner must pay his attorney.\n            Either way, it's not right for a person to be deprived\n        of his full damages from a wrongdoer.\n            HB 452 is a minor extension of Article 2226, which already\n        allows attorney's fees for valid claims against a person or\n        corporation for services rendered, labor done and several other\n        causes. Further, many written contracts already contain\n        provisions for attorney's fees. And several other Texas laws\n        permit recovery of fees.\n            In some foreign countries, the winner in every lawsuit\n        receives attorney's fees from the loser. These laws have\n        proved workable.\n            This bill excludes certain insurance contracts and certain\n        insurers to prevent overlapping coverage of· other statutes\n        relating to attorney's fees.\nCON:     This bill is a broad extension of the kinds of lawsuits in\n        which attorney's fees can be recovered. It will cause more\n        litigation and more crowded courts. Oral contracts, in\n        particular, should not involve attorney's fees. Suits on\n        these contracts often degenerate into swearing matches. It 1 s\n        enough for the basic claim to rest on the outcome without\n        putting attorney's fees in the balance, too.\n                                  (more)\n\f                                                                 HB 452\n                                                                 Page 2\n\n\n\n         In contract suits, defendants frequently countersue_\n     Wealthier parties will be in good position to run up the\n     costs and the potential liability far beyond the means of\n     a poor plaintiff. This may scare poor claimants away from\n     ever filing a lawsuit.\n         The proposal to exclude certain insurance contracts\n     and insurers from Article 2226 is an unwarranted grant of\n     immunity from liability for attorney's fees. They should\n     pay, like everyone else, when they lose.\nCOMMENTARY~  1) The potential advantages and disadvantages of\n     the proposed extension are hard to assess with much certainty.\n     More lawsuits are likely to be filed and the courts will be\n     busier. But that's one thing courts are for. Lawyers will\n     probably make more money. More contracts might be put into\n     writing to avoid the uncertainties and extra liability of\n     oral contracts. And perhaps this would reduce the number\n     of disputes and suits.\n     2) Texas courts may have to decide how the proposed legislation\n     is to apply to actions arising before the effective date of\n     the act and whether statutory provisions for attorney's fees\n     are always to control over contract provisions.\n     3) An alternative approach to help settle small lawsuits\n     is to increase the current $150-to-$200 limit for small\n     claims courts in Texas. Some state permit people to sue\n     for much larger claims and prohibit either party from\n     retaining an attorney.\n     4) HB 452 excludes ~ covera~e those contracts issued by\n     insurers subject to the Unfairlaim Settlement Practices Act.\n     In general, this includes such lines as accident and sickness,\n     motor vehicles, casualty, prepaid legal services, fire, lightning,\n     wind storms, hail, inland marine, rain, home warranty, and\n     fidelity, surety and guaranty bonds.\n     5) It is worth notin~ that the Uniform Claim Settlement\n     Practices Act does no give individual policyholders any remedy\n     for delayed or inadequate settlement of claims, much less\n     attorney's fees. Instead, the Act gives the State Board of\n     Insurance authority to deal with insurers which frequently\n     engage in certain practices. Thus, under HB 452, persons\n     will not be able to recover Article 2226 attorney's fees\n     against this la\"Pge class of insurers. (Under Insurance Code\n     §3.62 and §3.62-1, a policyholder can recover attorney's fees\n     in a case involving a life, health or accident policy.)\n     6) As written, the bill also excludes entirely from the\n     provisions of 2226 various companies issuing life, health\n     or accident policies. Presumably, then, such companies could\n     not take advantage of the provisions of 2226 for recovering\n     attorney's fees in their own lawsuits.\n                                   #\n\fAPPENDIX L\n\f                                 Assignment of Contract\n\n\n\n        White Lodging Services Corporation, an Indiana corporation, hereby assigns and\ntransfers to South Ausaircourt, L.P., an Indiana limited partnership, all of the interest of\nWhite Lodging Services Corporation, Inc.

Whiteco Industries, Inc., (\"Seller'') joined by White Lodging Services Corporation (''White\n     Lodging\") and other identified Sellers, including South Ausaircourt, L.P., entered into a\n     New Hotels Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"PSA\") with RLJ Lodging Fund II\n     Acquisitions, LLC (\"Purchaser\") dated March 16, 2006. Subsequent to the execution of the\n     PSA, Seller, White Lodging, South Ausaircourt, LP and Purchaser entered into a Ninth\n     Amendment to New Hotels Purchase and Sales Agreement (\"Ninth Amendment'') dated\n     December 20, 2007.\n\n2.   Both the PSA and the Ninth Amendment reference and pertain to, among other things,\n     \"Property 98\", which is described as \"Courtyard Austin Airport, 7809 East Ben White\n     Blvd., Austin, TX 78744.''\n\n3.   The definition of \"Contracts'' in the PSA \"shall mean, with respect to each Property ... (iv)\n     all contracts, agreements (other than subcontracts) and warranties covering the design,\n     development, construction, operations, maintenance and repair of the Property ... \"\n\n4.   Paragraph 3.l(a) of the PSA contemplates that \"[a]t Closing, Sellers or White Lodging shall\n     assign and deliver to Purchaser, pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2(b), true and complete\n     originals or copies of architects agreements and general contracts for the Properties ...\"\n\n5.   The language \"pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2(b)\" as contained in Paragraph 3.l(a) of\n     the PSA, and referenced in paragraph 4 above, is a Scrivener's Error and should likely be to\n     \"Section 4.1 (c), as there is no \"Section 4.2(b)\" in the PSA.\n\n6.   Paragraph 11.15 ofthe PSA contemplates that:\n\n            \"Further Assurances: Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,\n            each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable good\n            faith efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to\n            be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all\n            things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,\n            in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated\n            by this Agreement including, without limitation ...

Defendants deny the assignment of the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded.

Defendants deny that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover in the capacity in which\n\nthey sue.    Defendants did not provide consent to assign the contract upon which Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims are founded, and any such assignment is, therefore, made in violation of the anti-\n\nassignment.

Defendants deny that Swenson is liable in the capacity in which he has been sued.\n\nIn particular, Swenson is not a signatory or a party to the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded.\n\n        4.

Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole or\n\nm part by the acts or omissions of others for whose conduct Defendants are not legally\n\nresponsible.\n\n        3.         At all times material to Plaintiffs' allegations, Defendants' conduct conformed to\n\nthe applicable standard of care.\n\n        4.

If Plaintiffs settle with any other person or entity, then Defendants reserve the right to\n\nmake a written election of credit for settlement under §33.014 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code.\n\n        6.         Alternatively, if the economic loss rule does not completely bar all of Plaintiffs'\n\ntort claims, then, Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole\n\nor in part, by Plaintiffs' own negligence. Plaintiffs are wholly barred from recovery to the extent\n\nthe finder-of-fact determines Plaintiffs' comparative responsibility is 50% or greater, and, if\n\nPlaintiffs' comparative responsibility is less than 50%, any recovery must be reduced by\n\nPlaintiffs' percentage of responsibility determined by the finder-of-fact, in accordance with\n\nChapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\n        7.         Plaintiffs cannot recover for any amount that could have been avoided by their\n\nexercise of reasonable care.\n\n        8.         Plaintiffs' claims are barred, in whole or in part, by Plaintiffs' failure to mitigate\n\nany alleged damages.\n\n        9.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, resulted, if at all, from\n\nindependent, unforeseeable, intervening and/or superseding causes.

That the \"Statute of Limitations Accrual\" clause of the contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Statute of Limitations Accrual clause establishes the\n\n                   date upon which any cause of action against Counter-Claimants accrues, i.e., the\n\n                   date that Counter-Claimants' services were substantially completed, which such\n\n                   date time-bars all of Counter-Defendants' causes of action with a two-year\n\n                   limitations period;\n\n        c.         That the \"Waiver of Consequential Damages\" clause of the Contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Waiver of Consequential Damages clause bars Counter-\n\n                   Defendants from recovering any consequential damages from Counter-Claimants;\n\n                   and\n\n        d.

FACTUALBACKGROUND\n\n\n        1.         On or about January 1, 2005, White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. (\"White\n\nLodging\") and ESG entered into an agreement for architect services, as set forth in the following\n\ncontracts: (i) AlA Document B141- 1997 Part 1: Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner\n\nand Architect with Standard Form of Architect's Services (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 1\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"1;\" and (ii) AlA Document B141 - 1997 Part 2: Standard Form of\n\nArchitect's Services: Design and Contract Administration (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 2\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"2.\"\n\n        2.         The Contract - 1997 Part 1 and the Contract - 1997 Part 2 (collectively, the\n\n\"Contract\") were both executed on March 30, 2005. The Contract was not signed by Swenson in\n\neither his individual or representative capacity.\n\n        3.         Section 1.3.7.9 of the Contract contains an Anti-Assignment clause, wherein\n\n\"[n]either [White Lodging] nor [ESG] shall assign this Agreement without the written consent of\n\nthe other, except that [White Lodging] may assign this Agreement to an institutional lender\n\nproviding financing on the Project.\"\n\n        4.         Section 1.3.6 of the Contract contains a Waiver of Consequential Damages clause,\n\nunder which both ESG and White Lodging \"waive consequential damages for claims, disputes,\n\nor other matters in question arising out of or relating to this [Contract].\"\n\n        5.         Section 1.3.7.3 of the Contract contains a clause commonly known as a \"Statute\n\nof Limitations Accrual\" clause, which provides the method to determine when a cause of action\n\naccrues for the purpose of starting the statute of limitations. Specifically, section 1.3.7.3 reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 8\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                         53\n\f                   Causes of action between the parties to this Agreement pertaining\n                   to acts or failures to act shall be deemed to have accrued and the\n                   applicable statute of limitations shall commence to run not later\n                   than either the date of Substantial Completion for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring prior to Substantial Completion or the date of\n                   issuance of the final Certificate for Payment for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring after Substantial Completion. In no event shall such\n                   statute of limitations commence to run any later than the date\n                   when the Architect's services are substantially completed.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n        6.         On or about March 16, 2006 White Lodging, et al. and Counter-Defendants\n\nentered into an agreement entitled New Hotels Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between\n\nWhiteco Industries, Inc. and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC, (the \"New Hotels Purchase\n\nand Sale Agreement\"), through which Counter-Defendants claim that the Contract was assigned\n\nto them.\n\n        7.         ESG did not consent to an assignment of the Contract from White Lodging to\n\nCounter-Defendants, allegedly effectuated through the New Hotels Purchase and Sale\n\nAgreement.\n\n        8.         ESG's services were substantially complete before the date the Certificate of\n\nOccupancy was issued for the Project, which was on October 12, 2006. Therefore, any causes of\n\naction against Counter-Claimants accrued, if at all, no later than October 12, 2006.\n\n        9.         Counter-Defendants initiated this lawsuit and filed Plaintiffs' Original Petition\n\nand Request for Disclosure on July 7, 2010.                   Therefore, the negligence, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation and equitable subrogation causes of action asserted by Counter-Defendants,\n\neach of which are governed by a two-year limitations period, are time-barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

To\n\ndemonstrate why leave to amend should be granted, Appellees and Cross-\n\nAppellants respectfully show as follows:\n\n                              I. Nature of the Correction\n\n         Leave to amend is sought to correct the omission of ten words from the first\n\nsentence fragment of the third paragraph of the Summary of Argument on page 5\n\n\n                                            1\nMHDocs 6179368_1 12690.2\n\fof the Appellees’ Brief. That fragment reads, “acquired during its history that does\n\nnot address the issue here: whether RLJ satisfied Chapter 38.” It should have read,\n\n“The Architect’s argument relies on the general patina Chapter 38 acquired during\n\nits history that does not address the issue here: whether RLJ satisfied Chapter 38.”\n\nNo other alterations than the necessary correction to the word count in the\n\ncertificate of compliance and correction of the date on the certificate of service will\n\nbe made to the Amended Appellees’ Brief, a true and correct copy of which is\n\nattached as Exhibit “A” to this motion.\n\n                    II. Explanation of the Cause of the Need to Amend\n\n         The omission making this motion necessary was the result of an error that\n\noccurred during the final preparation of the brief. Using Microsoft Word, the last\n\nversion of the summary of argument was pasted in its entirety into the Appellees’\n\nBrief. In the process of doing so, the omitted phrase was deleted. Because the\n\ndocument was copied and pasted in its entirety, it was anticipated that the summary\n\nof argument appeared in the brief as it had appeared in the source document. That\n\nit did not so appear was not detected until after Appellees’ Brief was filed.\n\n                  III. Not Opposed by Counsel for Appellant, Cross-Appellee.\n\n         On Friday, June 12, 2015, counsel for the parties to this appeal conferred\n\nconcerning this motion to amend. Counsel for Appellant and Cross-Appellee is not\n\nopposed to the relief this motion requests.\n\n\n                                           2\nMHDocs 6179368_1 12690.2\n\f                                IV.

Appellees and Cross-Appellants further\n\nrequest any other relief to which this motion may entitle them.\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              MUNSCH HARDT KOPF & HARR PC\n\n\n                                              /s/Michael W.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n       This is a breach of contract case arising out of severe foundation problems at\n\nthe Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, located on East Ben White Boulevard, near\n\nBergstrom International Airport (“Project”). (CR187) 1. RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP;\n\nRLJ II-C Austin Air Lessee, LP; and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC\n\n(“RLJ” collectively), sued, among others, the architect, general contractor and soils\n\nengineer for breaching their separate contractual responsibilities related to the\n\nProject’s construction. (CR184-218). RLJ asserted that claim as assignee of and\n\nsuccessor-in-interest to and assignee of the rights under the Architectural Contract\n\nand the contract cause of action of White Lodging Services Corp. (“Owner”),\n\noriginal owner of the Project. (CR1124;1063-64). The architect, Elness, Swenson,\n\nGraham. Inc. (“Architect”), was the only remaining defendant when the case was\n\nsubmitted to the jury. (CR1121-29). Due to settlements by other parties and the\n\ntrial court’s pre-trial rulings, breach of contract was the only liability theory against\n\nthe Architect. Id.\n\n       The jury found that the Architect failed to “comply with the Architectural\n\nContract regarding the structural engineering services required by the contract”\n\n\n1\n  The Clerk’s Record is cited as “CR”; First Supplemental Clerk’s Record,“1SCR”; Second\nSupplemental Clerk’s Record, “2SCR”; Third Supplemental Clerk’s Record, “3SCR”). The\nReporters Record is cited by “[Volume Number]RR” Exhibits are cited to page or pages of the\nReporter’s Record on which they or the pertinent parts thereof appear. “4SCR__” refers to the\nsupplemental clerk’s record that is being requested, but is not yet available. See n.14.\n\n\n                                             1\n\f(“Structural Engineering Question”). (CR1126). The jury’s verdict assessed\n\n$785,000 in damages for the breach. (CR1125-27).\n\n       After trial, the Architect moved for and the trial court allowed credit under\n\nthe one satisfaction rule for $1.17 million paid by the General Contractor and the\n\nSoils Engineer (“Settling Defendants” collectively) in settlement of the contract\n\nclaims against them. (CR1173-79,1439,1710). The parties agreed to try the\n\nattorney’s fees claimed under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode (“Chapter 38”2) to the court instead of the jury. (CR201,1710).\n\n       RLJ presented evidence of its reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees for\n\nasserting the contractual claims against the Architect and the Settling Defendants.\n\n(3SCR3-611;2SCR1603-1605). The trial court only awarded fees for the\n\ncontractual claim against the Architect. For that claim, it determined that RLJ was\n\nentitled to recover from the Architect $901,650.96 as reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(CR1711). The trial court rendered judgment for RLJ in the principal sum of\n\n$516,650.96. (CR1711). It arrived at this amount by adding the amount of the\n\ndamages awarded in the jury verdict with the amount of the Chapter 38 attorney’s\n\nfees award, then subtracting the amounts paid in settlement by the Settling\n\nDefendants. (Id.). The judgment also awarded conditional appellate attorney’s fees,\n\n\n\n2\n References to “Chapter 38” also include the 1977 and later versions of its predecessor statute,\narticle 2226.\n\n\n                                                2\n\fcosts, and post-judgment interest. (Id.). The Architect timely filed its notice of\n\nappeal (CR1907-1913) and RLJ timely perfected its cross-appeal (1SCR3-4).\n\n                          II.     ISSUES PRESENTED\nA.    Whether the trial court correctly allowed RLJ to recover its attorney’s fees\n\n      under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code even if it\n\n      correctly applied the one satisfaction rule to offset the jury’s damage award?\n\nB.    Whether the trial court correctly determined that RLJ has standing to sue the\n\n      Architect under the assignments of rights from RLJ’s predecessors-in-\n\n      interest?\n\nC.    Whether the trial court’s determination may be further supported by\n\n      consideration of the supplemental clarification which the trial court\n\n      erroneously deemed parol evidence inappropriate for consideration?\n\n      (Appellees’ Reply Point).\n\nD.    Whether the trial court correctly ruled that the Architectural Contract was\n\n      not inadmissible hearsay and was sufficiently authenticated?\n\nE.    Whether the trial court erred in submitting the contractual liability issue\n\n      concerning structural engineering services and, in the unlikely event that it\n\n      did, whether the Architect failed to preserve the complaints it makes in this\n\n      appeal?\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fF.    Whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the damages for\n\n      diminution in value awarded by the jury?\n\n                         III.   STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      RLJ is not satisfied with the accuracy of Architect’s Statement of Facts and\n\nincludes the following as a brief statement of the facts relevant to Appellant’s\n\nissues. The proceedings below are described in the Statement of the Case and as\n\nnecessary in the argument section of this brief. RLJ also refers the court to the\n\nStatement of Facts in Cross-Appellant’s Brief at 6-13, and reserves to the argument\n\nsection further discussion of the facts relevant to those issues.\n\n      The Architect contracted with the Owner to design the Project. The\n\nArchitectural Contract obliged the Architect to provide architectural and structural\n\nengineering services. (12RR39,47). Under a separate contract to which the Owner\n\nwas not a party, the Architect engaged “[o]ur Structural Engineering firm...Marlin\n\nBridges Associates, Inc.” (“Structural Engineer”) to design the foundation.\n\n(12RR17-25,30,35,47,49;App.G).\n\n      Before the Project was complete, RLJ contracted to purchase the Project\n\nfrom the Owner, along with numerous other hotels. (CR184-218;606-676;707-\n\n709;App.J). Before RLJ closed the purchase of this hotel, the Project experienced\n\nsome cracking in the laundry room and around the pool area. (3RR122). RLJ was\n\nadvised that repair costs would be $50,000 (3RR187-88), and it received a credit of\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fthe same amount3 and closed the purchase. (CR626-28). After closing, the Project\n\nbegan to experience cracks in partition walls, shifting door frames, and other issues\n\nevident of foundation movement. (3RR118;4RR78-79;7RR47). Investigation\n\nrevealed the foundation design was inappropriate for the soil conditions at this site.\n\n(4RR111). This litigation ensued.\n\n                         IV.    SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n       None of the Architect’s complaints permit it to elude its liabilities for failing\n\nto comply with the Architectural Contract’s concerning the provision of structural\n\nengineering services.\n\n       Its attack on liability for RLJ’s attorney’s fees is invalid. As the verdict\n\nestablished, it had a valid claim for a just amount owed that was presented and\n\nunpaid for years, and which remained unpaid when this case was tried. Nothing in\n\nChapter 38 further requires the claimant to recover those damages in a judgment.\n\nThe Legislature eliminated that requirement when it amended the statute 38 years\n\nago. Neither it nor the Architect’s cited cases require the claimant to obtain a\n\njudgment. The Texas Supreme Court has said so. This Court has said so.\n\n       The Architect’s argument relies on the general patina Chapter 38 acquired\n\nduring its history that does not address the issue here: whether RLJ satisfied\n\n\n3\n  The Architect is incorrect to suggest this adjustment amount was for all of the Project’s\nfoundation problems that ultimately manifested themselves. (Appellant’s Brief 5-6). It was only\nfor the limited issues then known. (3RR187-88).\n\n\n                                              5\n\fChapter 38. The alpha and omega of that inquiry is the statute itself, not the\n\nlanguage of cases, other statutes, or general concepts about attorney’s fee recovery.\n\n       The trial court adhered to the precise language of the statute when it awarded\n\nRLJ its attorney’s fees. Even if the one satisfaction rule applied so that credit for a\n\nsettlement during trial could preclude recovery of the jury’s damage award, the\n\ntrial court did not err in allowing RLJ to recover its attorney’s after application of\n\nthat credit.\n\n       RLJ also had standing to sue on the Architectural Contract by virtue of an\n\nassignment of all intangible assets related to the Project. The Architect’s only\n\nargument is that a cause of action is not an intangible asset. This court, other\n\njurisdictions, and even the dictionary on which the Architect bases its argument,\n\nrecognize that a cause of action is an asset that is intangible. A supplement to this\n\nassignment made clear that it included all “causes of action” against the Architect.\n\nThe trial court erroneously ruled that it could consider the supplement, but it may\n\nnevertheless support the trial court’s standing determination because it was not\n\nparol evidence at all. Even if it were, the Architect was not a party to the contract\n\nthe supplement concerned and, therefore, could not invoke the parol evidence rule.\n\n       The Architect’s complaint that the Architectural Contract was inadmissible\n\nhearsay is baseless. The contract was not offered to prove anything other than the\n\nfact that it said what it said. Its complaint about improper authentication is equally\n\n\n                                          6\n\fflawed. The Architect used the contract as an exhibit and proved that it was a\n\nbusiness record.\n\n      The Architect waived its complaint that RLJ should have been required to\n\nprove its derivative liability for the Structural Engineer’s errors by failing to\n\nspecially except, file a verified plea that it was not liable in the capacity sued, and\n\nfailing to preserve its complaints at the charge conference. In any event, RLJ was\n\nnot obliged to establish vicarious liability because the Architect had direct,\n\ncontractual liability. Its only support to the contrary is a case that was long ago\n\nsuperseded by the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n      The Architect finally challenges the sufficiency of the expert testimony to\n\nsupport the jury’s diminution-in-value damage award. That testimony employed\n\naccepted appraisal methodologies and standards. Indeed, the valuation method\n\nused was the one the Texas Supreme Court has deemed appropriate. The valuation\n\ndate used was the date that was submitted in the court’s charge – an appropriate\n\ndate given what be considered. Criticism of the appraiser for allegedly failing to\n\nprovide actual performance data is baseless because the appraiser in fact provided\n\nit. His testimony did not include “stigma” damages and did not include damages\n\nfor lost profits. The damages need not have been “segregated” to be legally\n\nsufficient. Legally sufficient evidence supported the jury’s damage assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                      V.     ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.     The Trial Court Correctly Awarded RLJ Its Attorney’s Fees.\n       The Architect asserts the trial court erred in awarding RLJ Chapter 38\n\nattorney’s fees. It argues Chapter 38 required RLJ to “recover damages” without\n\nspecifying what a “recovery” of damages is. (Appellant’s Brief 16,17). The jury\n\nfound $785,000 in damages.4 (CR1127;App.B).

The “Judgment” Requirement Was Eliminated by\n                   the 1977 Amendment to Chapter 38’s Predecessor.\n      In 1977, the Legislature amended the predecessor to Chapter 38 to eliminate\n\n“finally obtain judgment” as a condition to recovering attorney’s fees.

If the existence of a “valid claim” included a\n\nrequirement that the claimant “recover” as the Architect’s cases suggest, it is\n\napparent that a verdict of liability and awarding damages is “recovery” enough to\n\nhave a valid claim.

Unlike the present Chapter 38 breach-of-contract\n\ncase, Osborne involved recovery of attorney’s fees under the DTPA, under which\n\nthe issue was whether the plaintiff “prevailed” – something Chapter 38 does not\n\nrequire. See V.A.2.a., supra. However, the analogy is instructive with respect to\n\nwhen the validity of the claim is measured. In Osborne, the plaintiff settled before\n\ntrial commenced with all but one defendant for an amount greater than the\n\ndamages awarded by the jury against the remaining defendant. Osborne, 252\n\nS.W.3d at 73. RLJ, on the other hand, reached the relevant settlement after trial\n\ncommenced.\n\n      This Court recognized in Osborne that “a net recovery is not necessary for a\n\nplaintiff to be considered a prevailing party.” Osborne, 252 S.W.3d at 76. But it\n\n\n                                        18\n\fconcluded, reasonably enough, that a party does not “prevail” at trial when it\n\nreceived before trial more than it recovered at trial for tort damages that all\n\ndefendants would have jointly and severally liable for under the contribution\n\nstatute. “It is one thing to allow attorney’s fees notwithstanding an opposing\n\nparty’s success on an offsetting claim. However it is another to allow attorney’s\n\nfees on a claim that, although successful, was paid before trial.” Id. (Emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n      The logic of Osborne implicit in the concept of what it means to “prevail” is\n\nexplicit under Chapter 38 which specifically says attorney’s fees may be recovered\n\nif the claim is valid and unpaid for more than thirty days after presentment. It\n\nshould be noted that some cases have suggest that fees are recoverable under\n\nChapter 38 if the presented claim is unpaid before trial commences.

For reasons discussed\n\nbelow, resolving that discrepancy is unnecessary here.\n\n      Chapter 38’s concern with whether a valid claim that existed before a trial\n\nbegins is the basis of the so-called “exception” to McKinley disallowing attorney’s\n\nfees if the claimant’s contract damages are fully offset by a “credit” for sums the\n\ndefendant paid. In these cases, including Osborne, the “credit” was due to\n\n\n                                        19\n\fpayments madd worade before trial so that there was no “valid claim” for a “just\n\namount owing” remaining when trial commenced.

Whether attorney’s fees are “damages” is beside the\n\npoint. It is still worth noting, however, the Legislature considered attorney’s fees as\n\n“damages” when it eliminated the “finally obtain judgment” requirement in 1977.\n\nThe Committee Report for the 1977 amendment states, “Even in a lawsuit\n\ninvolving a lot of money, the losing party in effect prevents the winner from\n\ngetting the full amount, because the winner must pay his attorney. Either way, it's\n\nnot right for a person to be deprived of his full damages from a wrongdoer.”\n\n(emphasis added; available from the Texas Legislative Reference Library at\n\nhttp://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/hroBillAnalyses/65-0/HB452.pdf;App.K).\n\n      RLJ was entitled to attorney’s fees. It met all of Chapter 38’s requirements.\n\nNothing further required RLJ to recover a judgment for damages to recover its\n\nattorney’s fees. The Architect cites no authority addressing the effect of post-trial\n\nsettlement credits. Authorities interpreting other statutes have no bearing on\n\nChapter 38. Even if they did, RLJ “prevailed.”\n\nB.    RLJ Was Assigned the Contract and the Cause of Action and\n      Had Standing to Sue.\n      On three separate occasions, the Architect has tried and failed to convince\n\ntwo different trial judges that RLJ could not sue because it did not have the\n\nnecessary consensual assignment of rights under the Architectural Contract.\n\n(CR220,1083-84). The outcome can be no different here.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      1.    RLJ Owned Both the Architectural Contract Rights and\n            Causes of Action of Action for Its Breach.\n      The Owner and the Architect were the original parties to the Architectural\n\nContract. (CR463;App.G). With the Architect’s consent, the Owner assigned to\n\nSouth Ausaircourt, L.P. (“Ausaircourt”) “all of [the Owner’s] interest … in and to\n\nthat certain Standard Form Agreement Between Owner and Architect … date[d] …\n\nJanuary 1, 2005 ….” (CR578;App.L). There is no dispute that the Owner\n\neffectively assigned its rights under the Architectural Contract to Ausaircourt.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief 19). The Architect does not question that Ausaircourt owned the\n\ncontract cause of action against it. (Appellant’s Brief 21). The Architect’s first\n\nchallenge to the trial court’s summary judgment is limited to whether Ausaircourt\n\neffectively and validly transferred the cause of action to RLJ. (Appellant’s Brief\n\n19,28).\n\n            a.    Ausaircourt Assigned the Contract to RLJ Under\n                  the PSA and the Cause of Action By Assignment of\n                  “Intangible Assets.”\n      After the Project was substantially completed, many properties, including\n\nthe Project, were contracted to be sold pursuant to a “New Hotels Purchase and\n\nSale Agreement” (“PSA”). (CR605-676). Under the PSA, the Owner sold\n\nAusaircourt “all contracts, agreements … and warranties covering the design,\n\ndevelopment, construction, operations, maintenance and repair of the Property….”\n\n(CR 613[“Assets” defined];615[“Contracts” defined]; 619[“Property” defined];\n\n\n                                       25\n\f621[sales agreement]; App.J). At closing, Ausaircourt assigned RLJ “all of\n\n[Ausaircourt]’s right, title and interest in and to all licenses, permits and all other\n\nintangible assets relating to the [Project]….” (CR701; emphasis added; App.M).\n\n(“Intangibles Assignment”).\n\n      RLJ has a clear chain of ownership from Ausaircourt through the PSA and\n\nIntangibles Assignment of both the Architectural Contract and the cause of action.\n\nUnder the PSA’s authorization for supplemental documentation effecting the\n\ntransaction (CR656), a later “Supplemental Clarification of Assignment”\n\n(“Supplemental”) specified the Intangibles Assignment “intended to assign”\n\nAusaircourt’s rights in the Architectural Contract “along with all intangibles,\n\nincluding but not limited to causes of action or claims owned by [Ausaircourt]\n\nagainst [the Architect].” (CR602-04; emphasis added; App.N).\n\n      2.     The Intangibles Assignment Transferred the Contract\n             Cause of Action.\n      The plain language of the Intangibles Assignment conveyed the cause of\n\naction to RLJ. Assignments are construed like any contract through rules of\n\nconstruction to ascertain the parties’ intent expressed in the written assignment.\n\nCommercial Structures and Interiors, Inc. v.

The Architect’s Argument Ignores Context and the\n                    Residuary Clause’s Purpose.\n      The Architect’s declaration that there is “[n]o authority … causes of action\n\nare included within ‘intangible assets’” is incorrect. (Appellant’s Brief 26). The\n\nArchitect’s only cited support, an old edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, defines\n\n\n                                        28\n\f“asset” as “[p]roperty of all kinds, real and personal, tangible and intangible,\n\nincluding … causes of action….” Black’s Law Dictionary 117 (6th ed.\n\n1990)(emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Architect argues that omission of “cause\n\nof action” from the examples of “intangible asset” means it is not one. Having\n\nalready described “cause of action” as an “asset,” the dictionary’s failure to repeat\n\nit as an example of an “intangible asset” does not support the Architect’s\n\nconclusion. Presumably, the dictionary reasonably assumed readers would\n\nunderstand that a “cause of action” is intangible property and that example lists are\n\nnot exhaustive. The Architect points to the dictionary’s inclusion of “judgment” or\n\n“claim” as examples of a “nominal asset” to suggest that they cannot be intangible\n\nassets. Nothing indicates that “intangible” and “nominal” assets are mutually\n\nexclusive. The parties did not incorporate any such distinction. The Architect may\n\nnot now urge interpreting the assignments as if they had.\n\n      The Architect’s narrow definition of “intangible asset” also ignores its\n\ncontext. In construing assignments, the courts consider the surrounding\n\ncircumstances. Coffin v. Douglas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409 (1884)(available at </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">8785</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">). Here, the parties were closing the sale of the Project. They intended RLJ to\n\nstep into Ausaircourt’s shoes. The PSA required the transfer of all Ausaircourt’s\n\nclaims and causes of action concerning the Project. (CR692). The PSA provides\n\nspecifically that Ausaircourt must cooperate with RLJ to enforce “any rights under\n\n\n                                         29\n\fthe [A]rchitectural [Contract] … respecting the design … and construction of the\n\nHotel.” (CR643;App.J). Thus, RLJ “bargained for an assignment of the prior\n\nowner’s possible causes of action … that occurred before [its] purchase.”\n\nBoerschig v.

(Appellant’s Brief 22) This\n\nargument relies on cases about whether wording in a real property deed also\n\neffectively assigns an accrued cause of action for damage to the real estate\n\nconveyed.

All the Supplemental did was provide more particularity; it did not alter\n\nand was not inconsistent with the intent originally expressed. Second, the\n\nSupplemental was not parol evidence because it did not antedate the PSA or the\n\nIntangibles Assignment. Third, the assignment was not fully integrated. Indeed, the\n\nPSA authorized the execution of any necessary additional instruments and\n\npermitted its modification in writing. (CR654,656;App.J).\n\n      Finally and ironically, the Architect has no standing to assert the parol\n\nevidence rule. The Architect is a stranger to both the Intangibles Assignment and\n\nthe PSA. The parol evidence rule does not apply to a dispute between a contracting\n\nparty and a contractual stranger. Baroid Equipment, Inc. v.

The\n\nSupplemental was appropriate for consideration despite the trial court’s erroneous\n\n“evidentiary” ruling and fully supports its decision that RLJ had standing through\n\nthe Intangibles Assignment.\n\n\n\n\n                                        35\n\f       5.     Alternatively, The PSA Transferred The Contract Cause\n              of Action When It Transferred the Contract.\n       If more than the Intangibles Assignment were required to transfer the cause\n\nof action, it is found in the PSA. It transferred all of Ausaircourt’s “right, title and\n\ninterest” to “the Assets,” which included “all contracts, agreements … and\n\nwarranties     covering     the    design,    development,       construction,     operations,\n\nmaintenance and repair of the Property….” (CR613,615,619;App.J). This clearly\n\nintended and effectuated an assignment of the Architectural Contract rights. The\n\nPSA’s assignment of all “right, title, and interest” in that contract includes the\n\ncause of action for its breach. See D Design Holdings, L.P. v.

Anti-assignment clauses do not prevent assignments of causes of action.\n\n                                              36\n\fAssignment of the cause of action was conclusively established under either the\n\nIntangibles Assignment or the PSA which makes irrelevant the Architect’s\n\narguments about the Architectural Contract’s assignment. Nevertheless, the\n\nArchitect’s challenge to the contract assignment is refuted here.\n\n       First, the Architect inaccurately asserts that RLJ admitted “alleg[ing] only an\n\nassigned cause of action … rather than assignment of the [Architectural] Contract\n\nitself.” (Appellant’s Brief 18,n.9). Yet the cited portion of RLJ’s pleading states\n\n“Ausaircourt assigned the Project, the contracts, … intangibles … and causes of\n\naction to [an] RLJ [entity].… and then assigned its rights … under the Project\n\ncontracts to … RLJ.” (CR222,329). This is no admission RLJ was not assigned the\n\ncontract, but simply acknowledges the PSA and Intangibles Assignments were\n\nseparate instruments.\n\n       Additionally, even if contract assignment had been proscribed by the anti-\n\nassignment clause, Ausaircourt’s transfer of the Architectural Contract to RLJ\n\nremained effective. “[T]he obligor a right to damages for breach of the terms\n\nforbidding assignment but [its breach] does not render the assignment ineffective.”\n\n\n\nPagosa Oil & Gas LLC v.

Though the Architect agreed its “services would ‘include’\n\nstructural engineering services” (12RR39,47-50;App.G), it now argues that without\n\npleading and proof of vicarious or respondeat superior liability, it has no\n\nresponsibility for the Structural Engineer’s work.

The Architect’s complaint now concerns\n\nevidence supporting the Architect’s responsibility for the Structural Engineer’s\n\nfailure to comply. Objection on one ground preserves no error on another.

The Architect Waived Any Complaint About the Duty\n             Submitted By Failing to Request Any Question,\n             Definition or Instruction.\n      Nevertheless, the Architect suggests under Ryan it should not be liable for\n\n“failure to comply with the Architectural Contract regarding the structural\n\nengineering services required” because it neither “guarantee[d]” quality nor\n\npromised “a perfect plan or satisfactory result.” (Appellant’s Brief 33, 34). Even if\n\nRyan had so constricted the Architect’s contractual duty, the Architect’s complaint\n\nis that the jury question incorrectly stated the liability standard. But the Architect\n\nrequested no question proposing any liability standard. (CR1119-20). Its own\n\nproposed bulk charge, on which it obtained no ruling, included no such liability\n\nstandard. (CR1108). It requested no definition or instruction submitting such a\n\nstandard. (CR1119-20). The Architect’s complaint was waived through these\n\nfailures. TEX. R. CIV.

(Appellant’s Brief 33). The Owner was not a party to that agreement.\n\n\n                                         47\n\fIts rights are unaffected by such a contract. See Prize Energy Res., L.P. v.

No matter how it chose to\n\narrange the Structural Engineer’s performance, the Architect was contractually\n\nanswerable to the Owner and its assigns for the breach. The Architect’s vicarious-\n\nonly argument overlooks the same principle the Architect espouses concerning the\n\nassignment: there is no privity; ergo, no contractual liability. If the remedy against\n\nthe Architect were limited to derivative liability, the Architect would be free to\n\ncontract for services completely free of liability for another’s failure to provide the\n\npromised performance.\n\n      8.

It\n\ninvolved a contract under which a general contractor agreed to provide, not\n\nperform, those services under a turnkey contract. 570 S.W.2d at 38-39. The\n\ncontractor in fact arranged for those services through licensed professionals. It was\n\nthe owner-defendant, not the architect, asserting illegality. Seaview Hospital held\n\nthe contract should be interpreted to be enforceable; i.e., that the general contractor\n\nonly agreed to arrange for others to provide such services.\n\n      The Architect’s complaint cannot be sustained. The trial court did not\n\nreversibly err in submitting a jury question concerning the Architect’s failure to\n\nperform structural engineering services.\n\nE.

Hornsby’s Testimony Was Well-Founded Based on Well-\n             Accepted Standards and Methodologies.\n      Real estate appraiser Paul Hornsby appropriately valued the Project on the\n\ndate the charge specified – August 31, 2010 (“Valuation Date”) – using the income\n\napproach under two different scenarios. “[T]he income approach … is appropriate\n\nwhen the property would, in the open market, be priced according to the income\n\nthat it already generates.” City of Harlingen v. Sharboneau, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2358932\"><a href=\"/opinion/2358932/city-of-harlingen-v-estate-of-sharboneau/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183\n\n(Tex. 2001). This is how a buyer would value the Project. (7RR128). Hornsby’s\n\nmethodology complied with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal\n\nPractice (“USPAP”). (7RR116, 122-23).\n\n      Hornsby appraised thousands of Austin-area properties over 34 years\n\n(7RR114), including over 100 hotels. (7RR115). Hornsby performed two August\n\n31, 2010 valuations: one for the Project’s actual impaired condition after the\n\nremediation had been implemented; another had its condition not been impaired.\n\n(7RR116,122-23,175-177). As USPAP requires, Hornsby considered three\n\ncustomary valuation methods: cost, comparable sales, and income. (7RR121-22).\n\nHornsby looked primarily to the income approach, with comparable sales as a\n\nvouchsafe only. There was insufficient sales data for comparable sales to be\n\n\n                                         52\n\findependently reliable. (7RR142-43). Unless a hotel is brand new, the cost method\n\nis inappropriate. (7RR128).\n\n      To determine the Project’s income-based value on the appraisal date were it\n\nundamaged (“undamaged value”), Hornsby considered average daily room rate,\n\naverage occupancy rate, typical expenses, and capitalization rate from published\n\ndata for five other similar nearby hotels and the Project’s actual performance data\n\nthrough the Valuation Date. (7RR130-34). With necessary adjustments, Hornsby\n\nestimated that the undamaged Project would have a $100.00 average daily rate and\n\n70% average occupancy. (7RR134-40). He concluded that the income-based\n\nundamaged value of the Project was $13,650,000. (7RR141-42,44). Hornsby\n\nchecked that valuation against comparable sales. (7RR142-44).\n\n      Hornsby then used income to value the Project “as-is” as of the appraisal\n\ndate, assuming all feasible repairs were complete and recognizing their future\n\neffectiveness was uncertain (“damaged value”).

Thus, worries about lay\n\ntestimony that did not attempt to relate a later sale to the valuation date are absent\n\nhere. The valuation method here was different. The testimony was presented by an\n\nexpert who related his data to the Valuation Date. Hornsby eschewed the\n\nArchitect’s unreliable approach and used the charge’s Valuation Date to determine\n\nboth the damaged and undamaged value as precisely as circumstances permitted –\n\ni.e., after the issues had manifested and the remediation work was complete, even\n\nthough the Project could not be fully repaired. (7RR123-25,176-77).\n\n             b.    The Jury Was Provided With Actual Performance\n                   Data.\n      Having argued that the Valuation Date in the charge was too late, the\n\nArchitect also argues that it was not late enough. It contends Hornsby’s diminished\n\nvalue opinion was undermined because it was based on predicted data as of the\n\nvaluation date instead of actual performance data that only became available until\n\nafter the court’s charge’s specified valuation date. In fact, Hornsby testified about\n\nthe diminution in value based on both the actual, post-valuation performance data\n\nand the projections based on the data available on the valuation date. (7RR149-53.)\n\n      Hornsby informed the jury that based on actual performance, the Project’s\n\ndiminution in value was $4.3 million (7RR152); based on the data available as of\n\n\n                                         58\n\fthe valuation date, its diminution in value was $6.4 million. (7RR153). Thus, even\n\nif the Architect were right about the proper underpinnings for calculating value\n\ndiminution, the Architect’s legal sufficiency attack on this basis is meritless\n\nbecause the jury was given a valuation based on the actual performance data. Its\n\ndiminution finding as caused by the Architect’s breach was within the range of\n\ndiminution damages the evidence supports. See Gulf States Utilities Co. v.

USPAP standards disallow consideration of information the\n\nhypothetical buyer and seller not then know. (7RR149,152).

It could have believed the Architect’s breach of its\n\nstructural design obligation alone caused all the diminution in value.\n\n      There evidence supported that conclusion.

The Soils Engineer correctly evaluated the Project site’s soil plasticity.\n\n(4RR114-117,119-122). The Architect was the center of the design team ultimately\n\nresponsible to see that the foundation design followed the Soils Engineer’s\n\nrecommendations.

The design was inappropriate because it did not properly\n\naddress resistance to movement from soil expansion. (4RR87-88,128-29). The\n\nGeneral Contractor was required to build the type of foundation specified, which it\n\ndid. (3RR159,157-58).

There Was No Recovery For “Stigma” Damages\n                   and No Double Recovery.\n      The Architect also reasons there was no evidence the Project was incapable\n\nof repair, so any diminution valuation necessarily included “stigma” damages.\n\nAgain, the Architect’s premise is flawed. “Stigma” or “fear” damages are those for\n\nreductions in property value due to the lingering perception or fear of a harmful\n\ncondition after it has been repaired or eliminated.

The damage\n\nhere is concrete reality, not anguished perception.\n\n      The factual flaw is that there was probative evidence that the foundation\n\ncould not be repaired. (4RR93,96-97). Thus, the question of diminution in value\n\nattributable solely to market risk/uncertainty intolerance for a non-existent\n\ncondition never arises. The foundation could not be strengthened or altered to\n\navoid ongoing movement. (4RR90-92,96-97). The best that could be accomplished\n\nwas to control soil expansion and resulting movement by limiting moisture\n\ninfiltration. (4RR90-97). The foundation problems would continue. The efficacy of\n\nthe repairs was uncertain. (Id.). Thus, market uncertainty was over an existing, not\n\nimagined, condition likely to cause future damage or deterioration. (Id.;7RR117,\n\n124,176-77). On that is required for value diminution.

The latter\n\ntakes into account future repair costs. (7RR123-24,177-78). That is how Hornsby\n\ncalculated the damaged value. (Id.). Indeed, there is no duplication in comparing\n\npost-repair value to the hypothetical undamaged value on the same Valuation Date.\n\nSee Parkway Co. v.

The charge’s\n\ndamage question avoided any possibility of double recovery by limiting repair\n\ncosts to those incurred on or before the Valuation Date (CR1127;App.B), which\n\nwere not factored in to Hornsby’s valuation. Those that might have been incurred\n\nafter the valuation date were included in the diminished value as of the Valuation\n\nDate. There was no double recovery and no recovery for “stigma” damages.\n\n            f.     Lost Profits Were Not a Separate Element of\n                   Recovery, But Were Only Used As Necessary for\n                   the Texas Supreme Court’s Approved Method of\n                   Valuing Property Producing Income.\n       Hornsby’s income-based Project valuation utilized the method the Texas\n\nSupreme Court approved for income-producing property. Sharboneau, 48 S.W.3d\n\nat 183. “[E]stimating … future income and applying a capitalization rate … allows\n\nthe appraiser to arrive at a present value.” Id. The income method consists of\n\n“estimating the net operating income stream of a property and applying a\n\n\n                                        66\n\fcapitalization rate to determine the property’s present value.” State v.

(7RR129-30).\n\nHornsby used these resources to arrive at an overall valuation of the Hotel itself.\n\nThis is not a “lost profits” model and RLJ did not obtain damages for “lost profits,”\n\ndespite the Architect’s claims. None of the Architect’s evidentiary insufficiency\n\narguments are meritorious.\n\n                      VI.    CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n      For the foregoing reasons, and the reasons presented in RLJ’s Cross-\n\nAppellants’ Brief, RLJ asks the Court to:\n\n      1) Reverse the trial court’s the judgment applying the one satisfaction rule\n\n         and delete the credit for the amount of the Settling Defendants’\n\n         settlements;\n\n      2) In the alternative, if and only if the one satisfaction rule applies, reverse\n\n         the trial court’s judgment concerning the award of attorney’s fees and\n\n         either reform it to award RLJ unsegregated fees for prosecution of all\n\n         contract claims against the Architect and the Settling Defendants, or\n\n         remand the case to the trial court solely for a determination of reasonable\n\n\n\n                                         67\n\f         and necessary attorney’s fees for the prosecution of all contract claims\n\n         against the Architect and the Settling Defendants;\n\n      3) Grant any one or more of 1) – 2) above subject to the conditions\n\n         prescribed; and/or\n\n      4) Otherwise affirm or modify the trial court’s judgment in favor of RLJ as\n\n         set forth herein and in RLJ’s Cross-Appellants’ Brief.\n\n      RLJ further requests such other relief to which it is justly entitled, provided\n\nsuch relief requested does not include a retrial on the merits of its claims against\n\nthe Architect.\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                             MUNSCH HARDT KOPF & HARR PC\n\n                                             /s/Michael W.

Garcia*, Cain*, Ezzell,\n                  D. Hill*, Ribak*, Rudd\n        0 nays--\n        2 absent--Maloney, Jackson\nWITNESSES:     None\nDIGEST: Article 2226, Revised Civil Statutes, allows recovery of\n     attorney's fees (in addition to the basic claim) for certain\n     limited kinds of lawsuits. HB 452 expands Article 2226 so\n     that reasonable attorney's fees may be recovered in all suits\n     founded on oral or written contracts. The bill also exempts\n     certain insurance contracts and certain insurers from all\n     provisions of the article.\nPRO:     Expanding the recovery of attorney's fees would serve the ends\n        of justice. Generally, the winner in a lawsuit cannot make\n        the loser pay attorney's fees, unless there is a specific\n        authorization in the law or a contract with that provision.\n        Many times a person with a valid, but small, claim will not\n        bother to go to court because the lawyer's fees are almost\n        as much as the possible proceeds of the suit, sometimes more.\n            Even in a lawsuit involving a lot of money, the losing\n        party in effect prevents the winner from getting the full\n        amount, because the winner must pay his attorney.\n            Either way, it's not right for a person to be deprived\n        of his full damages from a wrongdoer.\n            HB 452 is a minor extension of Article 2226, which already\n        allows attorney's fees for valid claims against a person or\n        corporation for services rendered, labor done and several other\n        causes. Further, many written contracts already contain\n        provisions for attorney's fees. And several other Texas laws\n        permit recovery of fees.\n            In some foreign countries, the winner in every lawsuit\n        receives attorney's fees from the loser. These laws have\n        proved workable.\n            This bill excludes certain insurance contracts and certain\n        insurers to prevent overlapping coverage of· other statutes\n        relating to attorney's fees.\nCON:     This bill is a broad extension of the kinds of lawsuits in\n        which attorney's fees can be recovered. It will cause more\n        litigation and more crowded courts. Oral contracts, in\n        particular, should not involve attorney's fees. Suits on\n        these contracts often degenerate into swearing matches. It 1 s\n        enough for the basic claim to rest on the outcome without\n        putting attorney's fees in the balance, too.\n                                  (more)\n\f                                                                 HB 452\n                                                                 Page 2\n\n\n\n         In contract suits, defendants frequently countersue_\n     Wealthier parties will be in good position to run up the\n     costs and the potential liability far beyond the means of\n     a poor plaintiff. This may scare poor claimants away from\n     ever filing a lawsuit.\n         The proposal to exclude certain insurance contracts\n     and insurers from Article 2226 is an unwarranted grant of\n     immunity from liability for attorney's fees. They should\n     pay, like everyone else, when they lose.\nCOMMENTARY~  1) The potential advantages and disadvantages of\n     the proposed extension are hard to assess with much certainty.\n     More lawsuits are likely to be filed and the courts will be\n     busier. But that's one thing courts are for. Lawyers will\n     probably make more money. More contracts might be put into\n     writing to avoid the uncertainties and extra liability of\n     oral contracts. And perhaps this would reduce the number\n     of disputes and suits.\n     2) Texas courts may have to decide how the proposed legislation\n     is to apply to actions arising before the effective date of\n     the act and whether statutory provisions for attorney's fees\n     are always to control over contract provisions.\n     3) An alternative approach to help settle small lawsuits\n     is to increase the current $150-to-$200 limit for small\n     claims courts in Texas. Some state permit people to sue\n     for much larger claims and prohibit either party from\n     retaining an attorney.\n     4) HB 452 excludes ~ covera~e those contracts issued by\n     insurers subject to the Unfairlaim Settlement Practices Act.\n     In general, this includes such lines as accident and sickness,\n     motor vehicles, casualty, prepaid legal services, fire, lightning,\n     wind storms, hail, inland marine, rain, home warranty, and\n     fidelity, surety and guaranty bonds.\n     5) It is worth notin~ that the Uniform Claim Settlement\n     Practices Act does no give individual policyholders any remedy\n     for delayed or inadequate settlement of claims, much less\n     attorney's fees. Instead, the Act gives the State Board of\n     Insurance authority to deal with insurers which frequently\n     engage in certain practices. Thus, under HB 452, persons\n     will not be able to recover Article 2226 attorney's fees\n     against this la\"Pge class of insurers. (Under Insurance Code\n     §3.62 and §3.62-1, a policyholder can recover attorney's fees\n     in a case involving a life, health or accident policy.)\n     6) As written, the bill also excludes entirely from the\n     provisions of 2226 various companies issuing life, health\n     or accident policies. Presumably, then, such companies could\n     not take advantage of the provisions of 2226 for recovering\n     attorney's fees in their own lawsuits.\n                                   #\n\fAPPENDIX L\n\f                                 Assignment of Contract\n\n\n\n        White Lodging Services Corporation, an Indiana corporation, hereby assigns and\ntransfers to South Ausaircourt, L.P., an Indiana limited partnership, all of the interest of\nWhite Lodging Services Corporation, Inc.

Whiteco Industries, Inc., (\"Seller'') joined by White Lodging Services Corporation (''White\n     Lodging\") and other identified Sellers, including South Ausaircourt, L.P., entered into a\n     New Hotels Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"PSA\") with RLJ Lodging Fund II\n     Acquisitions, LLC (\"Purchaser\") dated March 16, 2006. Subsequent to the execution of the\n     PSA, Seller, White Lodging, South Ausaircourt, LP and Purchaser entered into a Ninth\n     Amendment to New Hotels Purchase and Sales Agreement (\"Ninth Amendment'') dated\n     December 20, 2007.\n\n2.   Both the PSA and the Ninth Amendment reference and pertain to, among other things,\n     \"Property 98\", which is described as \"Courtyard Austin Airport, 7809 East Ben White\n     Blvd., Austin, TX 78744.''\n\n3.   The definition of \"Contracts'' in the PSA \"shall mean, with respect to each Property ...

The language \"pursuant to the terms of Section 4.2(b)\" as contained in Paragraph 3.l(a) of\n     the PSA, and referenced in paragraph 4 above, is a Scrivener's Error and should likely be to\n     \"Section 4.1 (c), as there is no \"Section 4.2(b)\" in the PSA.\n\n6.   Paragraph 11.15 ofthe PSA contemplates that:\n\n            \"Further Assurances: Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,\n            each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable good\n            faith efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to\n            be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all\n            things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,\n            in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated\n            by this Agreement including, without limitation ...

GENERAL DENIAL\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 92 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants generally deny\n\neach and every, all and singular, the assertions alleged in Plaintiffs' Sixth Amended Original\n\nPetition and any amendments thereto and request that Plaintiffs be required to prove the charges\n\nand allegations against these Defendants by a preponderance of the evidence and/or by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, as required by the Constitution and the Laws of the State of Texas.\n\nB.      SPECIFIC DENIAL\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 54 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants specifically deny\n\nthat all conditions precedent to the Plaintiffs' right to recover have been performed, have\n\noccurred, or have been waived or excused.        In particular, Defendants specifically deny that\n\nPlaintiffs have presented their claims for payment to Defendants or Defendants' duly authorized\n\nagents as required by Section 38.002(2) of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\nC.      VERIFIED DENIALS\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 93 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants make the\n\nfollowing verified denials:\n\n        1.         Defendants deny the assignment of the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded. Specifically, Defendants deny that Defendants or Defendants'\n\nauthorized representative(s) provided consent to assign the contract at issue to Plaintiffs.\n\nTherefore, any alleged assignment violates the anti-assignment clause of the contract and is null\n\nand void.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 2\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                    47\n\f        2.         Defendants deny that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover in the capacity in which\n\nthey sue.    Defendants did not provide consent to assign the contract upon which Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims are founded, and any such assignment is, therefore, made in violation of the anti-\n\nassignment. As such, Plaintiffs are not parties to the contract and lack standing to bring contract\n\nclaims against Defendants.\n\n        3.         Defendants deny that Swenson is liable in the capacity in which he has been sued.\n\nIn particular, Swenson is not a signatory or a party to the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded.\n\n        4.         Defendants incorporate by reference herein the sworn verification of Paul\n\nMittendorf£, a Principal and Vice President of Elness, Swenson, Graham Architects, Inc., which\n\nis attached to Defendants' First Amended Answer and Original Counterclaim for Declaratory\n\nJudgment filed with the Court on or about December 30, 2011.\n\nD.      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n        Pleading in the affirmative, if such       IS   necessary, Defendants would further show as\n\nfollows:\n\n        1.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, resulted, if at all, from conditions\n\nunrelated to any act, omission or conduct of Defendants.\n\n        2.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole or\n\nm part by the acts or omissions of others for whose conduct Defendants are not legally\n\nresponsible.\n\n        3.         At all times material to Plaintiffs' allegations, Defendants' conduct conformed to\n\nthe applicable standard of care.\n\n        4.         Plaintiffs' tort claims are barred in whole or in part, by the economic loss rule.\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 3\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                            48\n\f        5.         Alternatively, if the economic loss rule does not completely bar all of Plaintiffs'\n\ntort claims, then, pursuant to Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nDefendants are entitled to a credit for any settlement Plaintiffs receive from any other person or\n\nentity. If Plaintiffs settle with any other person or entity, then Defendants reserve the right to\n\nmake a written election of credit for settlement under §33.014 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code.\n\n        6.         Alternatively, if the economic loss rule does not completely bar all of Plaintiffs'\n\ntort claims, then, Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole\n\nor in part, by Plaintiffs' own negligence. Plaintiffs are wholly barred from recovery to the extent\n\nthe finder-of-fact determines Plaintiffs' comparative responsibility is 50% or greater, and, if\n\nPlaintiffs' comparative responsibility is less than 50%, any recovery must be reduced by\n\nPlaintiffs' percentage of responsibility determined by the finder-of-fact, in accordance with\n\nChapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\n        7.         Plaintiffs cannot recover for any amount that could have been avoided by their\n\nexercise of reasonable care.\n\n        8.         Plaintiffs' claims are barred, in whole or in part, by Plaintiffs' failure to mitigate\n\nany alleged damages.\n\n        9.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, resulted, if at all, from\n\nindependent, unforeseeable, intervening and/or superseding causes.              Any alleged action or\n\nomission on the part of Defendants was not the proximate cause, producing cause, or cause-in-\n\nfact ofPlaintiffs' alleged injuries or damages, if any.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

Defendants assert any and all defenses and seek any and all relief to which\n\nDefendants may be entitled in accordance with and pursuant to Chapter 150 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code.\n\n        11.        Plaintiffs lack standing to sue on and are not parties to the contract on which\n\nPlaintiffs' claims against Defendants are founded. Assignment of the contract to Plaintiffs was\n\nmade without consent ofDefendants, in violation of the anti-assignment clause of the contract.\n\n        12.        Plaintiffs' non-contract claims are barred by the appropriate statute oflimitations.\n\n        13.        Plaintiffs' non-contract claims, including claims for equitable subrogation, are\n\nbarred by the economic loss doctrine.\n\n        14.        Plaintiffs' recovery, if any, is limited to direct contract damages, if any, pursuant\n\nto the waiver of consequential damages clause in the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded. More specifically, Plaintiffs' claims for current and future lost\n\nrevenue, profits and diminution in value are barred by the consequential damages clause of the\n\ncontract.\n\n        15.        Plaintiffs' claims are barred against Defendants because Plaintiffs purchased the\n\nbuilding in question \"as is.\"\n\n        16.        Defendants reserve the right to amend or supplement with any additional\n\naffirmative defenses or pleas of avoidance to which Defendants may be entitled.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n                     COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n\nA.

As provided for by Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nCounter-Claimants seek the following declarations from the Court:\n\n        a.         That the \"Anti-Assignment\" clause of the contract       IS   valid, enforceable and\n\n                   applies to Counter-Plaintiffs, making any ostensible assignment of the contract, in\n\n                   violation of the Anti-Assignment clause, null and void and of no effect;\n\n        b.         That the \"Statute of Limitations Accrual\" clause of the contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Statute of Limitations Accrual clause establishes the\n\n                   date upon which any cause of action against Counter-Claimants accrues, i.e., the\n\n                   date that Counter-Claimants' services were substantially completed, which such\n\n                   date time-bars all of Counter-Defendants' causes of action with a two-year\n\n                   limitations period;\n\n        c.         That the \"Waiver of Consequential Damages\" clause of the Contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Waiver of Consequential Damages clause bars Counter-\n\n                   Defendants from recovering any consequential damages from Counter-Claimants;\n\n                   and\n\n        d.         That Swenson was not a signatory or a party to the contract at issue here and, as\n\n                   such, cannot be liable to the Counter-Defendants under the contract.\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

FACTUALBACKGROUND\n\n\n        1.         On or about January 1, 2005, White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. (\"White\n\nLodging\") and ESG entered into an agreement for architect services, as set forth in the following\n\ncontracts: (i) AlA Document B141- 1997 Part 1: Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner\n\nand Architect with Standard Form of Architect's Services (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 1\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"1;\" and (ii) AlA Document B141 - 1997 Part 2: Standard Form of\n\nArchitect's Services: Design and Contract Administration (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 2\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"2.\"\n\n        2.         The Contract - 1997 Part 1 and the Contract - 1997 Part 2 (collectively, the\n\n\"Contract\") were both executed on March 30, 2005. The Contract was not signed by Swenson in\n\neither his individual or representative capacity.\n\n        3.         Section 1.3.7.9 of the Contract contains an Anti-Assignment clause, wherein\n\n\"[n]either [White Lodging] nor [ESG] shall assign this Agreement without the written consent of\n\nthe other, except that [White Lodging] may assign this Agreement to an institutional lender\n\nproviding financing on the Project.\"\n\n        4.         Section 1.3.6 of the Contract contains a Waiver of Consequential Damages clause,\n\nunder which both ESG and White Lodging \"waive consequential damages for claims, disputes,\n\nor other matters in question arising out of or relating to this [Contract].\"\n\n        5.         Section 1.3.7.3 of the Contract contains a clause commonly known as a \"Statute\n\nof Limitations Accrual\" clause, which provides the method to determine when a cause of action\n\naccrues for the purpose of starting the statute of limitations. Specifically, section 1.3.7.3 reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 8\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                         53\n\f                   Causes of action between the parties to this Agreement pertaining\n                   to acts or failures to act shall be deemed to have accrued and the\n                   applicable statute of limitations shall commence to run not later\n                   than either the date of Substantial Completion for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring prior to Substantial Completion or the date of\n                   issuance of the final Certificate for Payment for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring after Substantial Completion. In no event shall such\n                   statute of limitations commence to run any later than the date\n                   when the Architect's services are substantially completed.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n        6.         On or about March 16, 2006 White Lodging, et al. and Counter-Defendants\n\nentered into an agreement entitled New Hotels Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between\n\nWhiteco Industries, Inc. and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC, (the \"New Hotels Purchase\n\nand Sale Agreement\"), through which Counter-Defendants claim that the Contract was assigned\n\nto them.\n\n        7.         ESG did not consent to an assignment of the Contract from White Lodging to\n\nCounter-Defendants, allegedly effectuated through the New Hotels Purchase and Sale\n\nAgreement.\n\n        8.         ESG's services were substantially complete before the date the Certificate of\n\nOccupancy was issued for the Project, which was on October 12, 2006. Therefore, any causes of\n\naction against Counter-Claimants accrued, if at all, no later than October 12, 2006.\n\n        9.         Counter-Defendants initiated this lawsuit and filed Plaintiffs' Original Petition\n\nand Request for Disclosure on July 7, 2010.                   Therefore, the negligence, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation and equitable subrogation causes of action asserted by Counter-Defendants,\n\neach of which are governed by a two-year limitations period, are time-barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.
