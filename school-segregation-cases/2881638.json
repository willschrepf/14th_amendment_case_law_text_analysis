GIBSON, Circuit Judge.\n\n       The Jenkins class, representing the children of the Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict in this school desegregation case, has appealed the district court's order\ndeclaring the district unitary and dismissing the case with prejudice. The order\nfollowed a hearing set by the court to consider KCMSD's amended motion for equitable\nrelief from a ruling of the Missouri State Board of Education declaring that the\naccreditation of KCMSD would be withdrawn effective May 1, 2000. After the district\ncourt denied KCMSD's motion, it proceeded sua sponte to a discussion of the unitary\nstatus of the district and declared the district to be unitary. We reverse and remand.\n\n       We need not discuss in detail the long history of the Kansas City school\ndesegregation litigation. After a finding of constitutional violations, years of effort to\nremedy them, and extended litigation and appeals which we need not catalog, the State\nof Missouri moved for a declaration of unitary status. On March 27, 1997, Judge\nRussell Clark, who had presided over the case since its filing, granted the motion in\npart, but denied it in part. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151(W.D.Mo.), aff'd,\n122 F.3d 588 (8th Cir. 1997) (Jenkins XIV). In particular, Judge Clark held that\ntwenty-six percent of the achievement gap of ten normalized curve equivalents between\nKCMSD's black and white students was a vestige of the constitutional violation, and\nhe ordered KCMSD to eradicate that vestige within the next three years. Id. at 1157-\n65, 1179. At the same time, Judge Clark approved a settlement between KCMSD and\nthe State, providing that the State would pay KCMSD $320 million over three years,\nand in return, would be dismissed from the litigation. Id. at 1180.\n\n       On January 28, 1999, the district judge who succeeded Judge Clark to\nsupervision of the case entered an order declaring that the State had paid its obligation\nunder the settlement and dismissing the State from the case. Order of January 28,\n1999. The court said that the State must continue to comply with any obligations that\nit undertook during the course of the lawsuit that were not covered by the agreement\n\n                                           -3-\n\fand warned the State against taking any action that might prevent KCMSD from\nultimately fulfilling its court-ordered remedial goals. Id. at 6. The court then pointed\nto Judge Clark's order giving KCMSD three years to eliminate all the remaining\nvestiges of segregation; the court commented that fifteen months remained on this time\nline. Id. After considering the \"lengthy and litigious process\" likely to attend a\nrenewed motion for unitary status, the court directed the parties to prepare for a unitary\nstatus hearing to begin on January 3, 2000. Id.\n\n       Counsel appeared before the court on August 24, 1999 for a scheduling\nconference, which the court stated was \"to address . . . preparing for a unitary status\nhearing in January,\" specifically what evidence the parties anticipated presenting in the\nhearing. Counsel for the class suggested delaying the hearing. He said that it would\nbe difficult for KCMSD to make a case that everything practicable had been done,\nbecause there was a \"pretty widely shared agreement that this is not the case.\"\nFurthermore, some test data were not in, and others seemed to show the achievement\ngap had not been closed. Nor had KCMSD implemented the curriculum, professional\ndevelopment, and accountability plans designed to close the gap. Also, KCMSD had\njust hired a new superintendent. The class's counsel suggested a hearing in the late\nsummer of 2000.\n\n       The court then pointed to Judge Clark's statement that gave the district three\nyears to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination, and stated he \"believed the Supreme\nCourt when they told me to get this school district returned to local control,\" and that\nboth he and Judge Clark had given KCMSD three years to comply.\n\n       Counsel for the class pointed out that recently the monitoring had been less\nheavy-handed, and that the monitoring committee, which was commonly referred to as\nthe DMC, had been sending things back to the new superintendent to handle. Counsel\nsaid there were many ways the committee could lighten its monitoring. Counsel for the\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fclass stated that he did not anticipate that he would be presenting new approaches or\nanything other than implementation of the five programs already planned for reducing\nthe black-white achievement gap: the curriculum, classroom practices, professional\ndevelopment, assessment, and accountability plans.\n\n       The district court then stated that he sensed that both the class and KCMSD\nwere \"pretty satisfied that the school district can't . . . go forward with the burden of\nproof that the gap has narrowed.\"1 He said he would need to have a hearing to take\ntestimony from one of the experts who testified at the earlier unitariness hearing and\nalso to hear whether the district was \"on track\" in implementing the five programs. The\ncourt commented that the problem had been the delay in implementation of the five\nplans to reduce the achievement gap. The court further commented that the track\nrecord of the district had not convinced him that KCMSD was putting heart and soul\nbehind implementing the five areas or that KCMSD could get out of the political mode\nand get into looking for the best interests of the children.\n\n      Following this conference, the court filed a written order formally denying the\nmotion for a continuance, stating:\n\n      [T]he Court provided for termination of the [DMC] by March 25, 2000.\n      See Order at 21, Doc. # 4575 (August 21, 1997), . . . . [E]ven if the\n      KCMSD has not attained unitary status, all three Monitors would be\n      removed. See id. At that time, the Court would need to determine the\n      need for new Monitors or even a new remedial structure. Such a\n\n\n      1\n        This statement came after the following exchange. When the class counsel said\nin court there was \"widely shared agreement\" that KCMSD had not done everything\npracticable to eradicate the achievement gap, KCMSD did not object to this\nrepresentation. KCMSD's counsel said: \"[W]e have a sense at the moment . . . that\nthe district would have an uphill fight in January.\"\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      determination cannot be made without evidence of the KCMSD's current\n      status.\n\nOrder of August 26, 1999 at 17-18 (emphasis added).\n\n       On October 21, 1999, the State Board of Education voted to withdraw\naccreditation of KCMSD as of May 1, 2000. In response, KCMSD filed an amended\nmotion for equitable relief on October 25, 1999, seeking to bar the State's action on the\nground that it would interfere with the remedial decree in Jenkins. That same day, the\ncourt issued an order setting KCMSD's motion for hearing on November 1 to hear\nevidence on three enumerated issues: whether the court should (1) rejoin the State as\na party; (2) declare void ab initio the action of the Missouri State Board of Education\nin classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district; and (3) enjoin the application\nto KCMSD of several statutes on which the State Board's action was based.2\n\n       The court held the hearing on KCMSD's motion on November 1-2, 1999. We\nneed not discuss in detail the testimony before the court, except to state that it was\ndirected to the issues outlined by the district court in its order of October 25. The\nparties agreed in oral argument before us that the hearing was not a unitary status\nhearing. At the conclusion of the proceedings of November 2, the court asked\nKCMSD's staff counsel whether the KCMSD board agreed there should be a unitary\nstatus hearing in January. Counsel responded that the board voted unanimously to seek\na continuance and authorized her to agree to a continuation of the monitoring\ncommittee in its current configuration until the end of the 1999-2000 academic year in\nJune.\n\n\n\n      2\n       In KCMSD's motion for relief from the de-accreditation action, it asked the\ncourt to stay the de-accreditation until the five remedial plans had been fully\nimplemented.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f       On November 9, 1999, KCMSD filed a written motion requesting a continuance\nof the unitary status hearing set for January 3, 2000, and consenting to continued\nsupervision by the DMC. KCMSD further suggested that it would be appropriate to\nextend the term limits of the DMC beyond March 25, 2000, and to set a hearing at the\nend of the academic school year, June 3, 2000, to assess the role of the DMC and\nconsider a reduction in the scope of the oversight by that body in the future.\n\n       On November 17 the district court issued an order denying KCMSD's request to\nrejoin the State as a party and refusing to declare void ab initio the action of the State\nBoard of Education classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district.3 After ruling\non the motion before it, the court proceeded sua sponte to consider the issue of whether\nthe district was unitary. In light of the nature of our ruling, it is not necessary that we\nset out in detail the substance of the court's reasoning. Suffice it to say that, much to the\nparties' surprise, the court ended by declaring that the KCMSD had achieved unitary\nstatus. The court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       We first consider whether the district court erred in determining KCMSD to be\nunitary and dismissing the case without taking evidence or hearing arguments on the\nissue.\n\n      In January 1999 the court scheduled a hearing on unitary status for January 2000,\nand both in a conference with counsel and a written order in August 1999 commented\n\n       3\n        The district court's ruling on the de-accreditation question is not before us. The\nState argued before the district court that the action of the State Board of Education is\neffective May 1, 2000 and that the KCMSD has not exhausted its administrative\nremedies. KCMSD conceded that its administrative appeal rights were not yet\nexhausted and were not yet ripe.\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fspecifically on the necessity for a hearing to evaluate what continuing judicial\ninvolvement would be required. The order setting the November 1-2, 1999 hearing\nlimited that hearing to the issues of whether the State should be rejoined as a party and\nwhether the de-accreditation order should be declared void ab initio. The transcript\ndiscloses that the testimony and evidence at the hearing were directed to these issues.\nThe court's inquiry at the conclusion of the November 1-2 hearing as to whether there\nshould be a unitary status hearing in January demonstrates that the court did not consider\nit had conducted such a hearing. KCMSD's counsel's response to this inquiry by the\ncourt and its written motion filed November 9, 1999 for a continuance of the unitariness\nhearing demonstrate that KCMSD did not consider that there had been a hearing on\nunitary status.\n\n       It is evident from what we have said above that KCMSD did nothing to contest\nthe Jenkins class's statements that neither KCMSD nor the class were ready to move\nforward and establish that KCMSD was unitary, and the judge acknowledged as much.\nFrom this and from the court's order limiting the proof at the November 1-2 hearing, the\nJenkins class as well as KCMSD went into the hearing with no expectation that unitary\nstatus was an issue to be tried.\n\n      In Jenkins XIV we held, based upon abundant Supreme Court authority, that once\nthere has been a finding that a defendant established an unlawful dual school system in\nthe past, there is a presumption that current disparities of the sort listed in Green v.\nCounty School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 435 (1968), are the result of the defendant's\nunconstitutional conduct. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 593. Therefore, the burden of\nproving unitariness rests on the constitutional violator. Id. at 593-95. Our statement in\nJenkins XIV found support in Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992), where the\nSupreme Court stated with respect to racial imbalance in student attendance caused by\nthe unlawful policy of a school system, \"The School District bears the burden of\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fshowing that any current imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior\nviolation.\" Other statements in Freeman similarly recognized that the burden was on the\ndistrict to demonstrate a good faith commitment to compliance with the desegregation\nplan. Id. at 498-99. This presumption places the burden in any hearing on unitary status\non KCMSD, including the issue of reduction in student achievement and the\nachievement gap, and it admittedly made no attempt to demonstrate that unitary status\nhad been achieved.4\n\n       This court stated in Booker v. Special School District No. 1, 585 F.2d 347, 352\n(8th Cir. 1978), \"There is no question that in a proper case a federal district court that\nhas issued an injunction may vacate it or modify it if it is established that to continue it\nin force or without modification would work an inequitable result.\" (emphasis added.)\n\n       The Seventh Circuit faced a nearly identical situation in United States v. Board\nof School Commissioners, 128 F.3d 507 (7th Cir. 1997). There, the Board of School\nCommissioners of the Indianapolis Public School District requested that the judge lift\nan injunction requiring busing of public school students on the ground that the district\nhad achieved unitary status.5 The district court declined to address the issue of unitary\n\n\n       4\n        In Jenkins XIV, we pointed to the finding of the district court in the first\nremedial order decisions that \"the inferior education indigenous of the state-compelled\ndual school system has lingering effects in the Kansas City, Missouri School District.\"\n122 F.3d at 594. We also quoted a later finding, \"Segregation has caused a system\nwide reduction in student achievement in the schools of the KCMSD.\" Id. (emphasis\nin original). The district court found that the adverse effect on minority student\nachievement still persisted in 1997 in the form of an achievement gap; we held that\nfinding was not clearly erroneous. 122 F.3d at 597-99.\n       5\n       The Seventh Circuit's opinion stated that the district wanting to phase out can\nbe permitted to do so only by presenting evidence that the existing order had outlived\n\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fstatus, but modified its existing order by extending the busing to kindergartners, an issue\nthat had not been raised by the parties. The Seventh Circuit, in an opinion by Chief\nJudge Posner, stated:\n\n      No one asked the judge for this modification; there was no hearing on it.\n      As a result, there is nothing in the judge's order, or in the record on which\n      it is based, about the respective kindergarten programs, facilities, and\n      capacities in the transferor and transferee areas or about the\n      appropriateness of compelling the busing of such young children against\n      their parents' wishes and whether they are to be in the same buses with\n      much older children.\n\n128 F.3d at 512. In support of the court's order that they, like KCMSD here, did not\nseek in the first place, the appellees pointed out that the district judge had \"learned a\nlot about public school education in Marion County in the thirty years that he has been\npresiding over this litigation.\" Id. The Seventh Circuit responded:\n\n      [G]reat knowledge is a temptation as well as a resource: a temptation to\n      blur the separation of powers, to shift the balance between the federal\n      courts and state and local government too far toward the courts, and to\n      disregard procedural niceties, all in fulfillment of a confident sense of\n      mission.\n\nId.\n\n      Although the Seventh Circuit was dealing with expansion of a remedy and we\ndeal with the elimination of one, the principle is the same: procedural niceties equate\nwith due process and must be afforded the parties. As the Seventh Circuit vacated the\n\n\n\nits usefulness. 128 F.3d at 510.\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fsua sponte order and remanded for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing, so\nshould we.\n\n        Counsel for KCMSD conceded that the court's ruling was on a ground not argued\nby the parties, but insisted that the court was thinking ahead of KCMSD. Having\nachieved its unexpected release from litigation, KCMSD hastens to give support to the\nruling.\n\n       KCMSD argues that the district court did not err in declaring KCMSD unitary\nwithout benefit of notice, hearing, argument, or other evidentiary presentation.\nKCMSD cites Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., 370 U.S. 626 (1962), for the principle that\n\"Parties are not always entitled to a hearing.\" Link has little, if any, relevance to this\ncase. In Link, the district court set a pretrial conference and notified counsel. When\nthe lawyer for the plaintiff did not appear at the time set, the court dismissed the action\nfor failure to appear and failure to prosecute. Id. at 629. Link did no more than rule\nthat the dismissal for failure to prosecute was not an abuse of discretion. Id. at 633.\n\n       Link is about sanctions, not about what opportunity parties should be given to\npresent evidence and make argument before a ruling on the merits of their case. It\ncertainly is not about the proper procedure for dismissal of a school desegregation case\nin which a school district has been adjudged liable for constitutional violations and\nsubjected to a remedial decree. However, Link does have some general applicability\nto this case insofar as it discussed the circumstances that can justify entry of an order\nwithout the opportunity to be heard: \"The adequacy of notice and hearing respecting\nproceedings that may affect a party's rights turns, to a considerable extent, on the\nknowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to have of the\nconsequences of his own conduct.\" 370 U.S. at 332. Unlike Link, where the attorney\nhad notice of the pretrial conference, and should have known that his failure to appear\n\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fwould have consequences, in this case there was no notice to any of the parties, either\nconstitutional violator or victims, that the issue of unitary status was to be considered\nand decided at the November hearing. To the contrary, there was every assurance that\nunitary status would not be considered until the scheduled January 2000 hearing, and\nKCMSD's requests for continuance strongly suggested that it would not even be in a\nposition to contend that the district was unitary in January 2000. Link certainly\ndemonstrates that simple fairness would require notice and hearing before a decision\nthat dismisses the case.\n\n       At oral argument, KCMSD's counsel suggested that the Jenkins class had the\nopportunity to present evidence on the unitariness question at the hearing on the class's\nmotion to stay the dismissal pending appeal. The opportunity to argue a stay motion,\nwith the class having the burden on four discrete issues which placed the constitutional\nvictims in the position of arguing that the horse should be put back in the barn, should\nnot substitute for a chance to present evidence and argue the merits in a hearing called\nfor that purpose.\n\n       The sua sponte ruling declaring the district unitary and releasing the admitted\nconstitutional violator from further court supervision, without giving notice either to the\nconstitutional violator or the victims or permitting the parties to present evidence and\nargue these issues, was error.\n\n                                            II.\n\n      Although we do not reach the merits of the unitariness issue, we think it\nappropriate to comment on some issues the district court will face on remand.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f        The testimony at the hearing focused on the impact of the de-accreditation order,\nwhich Dr. John Murphy, a member of the DMC, described as a death knell, and\nSuperintendent Benjamin Demps6 described as a train wreck. Whatever description is\napplied, it was a resounding statement, of thunderclap proportions, that KCMSD had\nnot been successful in dealing with the system wide reduction in student achievement,\nmuch less the achievement gap. In addition, there was considerable evidence about the\neffect of the establishment of some fifteen charter schools, unaccredited and not subject\nto state control, which had siphoned off more than 3,000 students from KCMSD. This\nresulted in KCMSD suffering a financial loss in the millions of dollars the law required\nbe paid to the charter schools. These developments, the result of state action, have\nplaced KCMSD in a most difficult situation, according to both Superintendent Demps\nand Dr. Murphy, in working to deal with the difficult educational problems KCMSD\nfaces.\n\n       The district court commented that many of the hurdles that are presented to the\nplan and to unitary status are not constitutional violations. Order of November 17,\n1999 at 36. This misses the point. Hurdles and obstacles to eliminating the vestiges\nof the past dual school system are properly the subject of attention by the court and\nmay be addressed by injunctive order, if needed. Limitations on a school authority's\ndiscretion that impede the disestablishing of a dual school system must fall. North\nCarolina State Board of Educ. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45 (1971). This principle was\napplied earlier in this litigation to state action both by this court, Jenkins v. Missouri,\n855 F.2d 1296, 1309-15 (8th Cir. 1988), aff'd in relevant part, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), and\n\n      6\n       Superintendent Benjamin Demps, Jr. was hired as Superintendent of Schools\nas of August 1, 1999. The record demonstrates that there was considerable enthusiasm\nat his assuming the reins of leadership of KCMSD after a period of frequent\nreplacement of Superintendents. Superintendent Demps had significant management\nexperience in federal and state government.\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fthe Supreme Court in Jenkins v. Missouri, 495 U.S. 33, 57-58 (1990). The court has\nthe obligation to vindicate federal constitutional guarantees and to take what action is\nnecessary for this purpose. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 495 U.S. at 57-58.\n\n       The district court expressed most positively that he was guided by the three-year\nlimitation set by Judge Clark in March 1997, and he had adopted this as his own\nlimitation as well. Judge Clark's order, however, while establishing the three-year\nlimitation, was unable to say with absolute certainty that KCMSD would have attained\nunitary status in that time, and recognized that some thought five years might be\nneeded. 959 F. Supp. at 1179. In affirming this order of Judge Clark's, we commented\nthat the three-year time table was an optimistic prediction, see 122 F.3d at 601, and the\nfigure was not susceptible of precise calculation. Id. at 602. It is significant that the\nthree-year period has seen the termination of one superintendent of schools, the hiring\nof another, the later buyout of his contract, and the search for and hiring of the present\nsuperintendent.\n\n       Superintendent Demps stated that the district is currently undertaking efforts to\nreduce the achievement gap, which included instructional methodology and\nprofessional development, but he said this has not moved far since he came on board.\nSuperintendent Demps further testified that the district is in the process of\nimplementing the core curriculum; however, he had heard from Cheryl Shannon, Chief\nof Staff of KCMSD, that the curriculum was not aligned with the Missouri Show-Me\nStandards. There was a difference of opinion on this, and they were going to see to it\nthat the court-ordered curriculum was properly aligned with the State's new Show-Me\nStandards.\n\n      Shannon stated that there was work remaining to be done toward implementation\nof the programs ordered to reduce the achievement gap. Implementation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fprofessional development and assessment plans had begun, but there were hurdles\nremaining toward getting those plans up and running in part caused by vacancies in key\npositions. Further, the accountability plan had not been completely developed or\naccepted, and several scripts had not been developed, including those for teacher,\nprincipal, school, and central office evaluation. Shannon believed that the de-\naccreditation decision would risk further delay in implementing the various plans.\n\n       Superintendent Demps identified the accountability plan as a major part of the\nimprovement program. Counsel informed this court at argument that not even a pilot\nprogram would be in place until the academic year 2000-01, and full implementation\ncould not occur before the 2001-02 academic year. KCMSD's brief acknowledged that\n\"teacher acceptance of the court-approved accountability plan is certain to be among\nthe [topics for the] District's upcoming negotiations.\" A question obviously exists\nabout not only the time frame, but also implementation of the accountability program.\n\n       It is also of significance that the March 27 termination of the desegregation\nmonitoring committee and the de-accreditation effective date fall in the middle of the\nschool year. Superintendent Demps expressed his deep concern about this, and we\nshare this concern about the effect of an arbitrarily selected cut-off date bifurcating a\nschool year.\n\n       The order of the district court in dismissing the action viewed the question as an\nall-or-nothing proposition. Yet, the Supreme Court has recognized that gradual and\nincremental withdrawal of the court's supervision may be most appropriate. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 489 (\"Partial relinquishment of judicial control, where justified\nby the facts of the case, can be an important and significant step in fulfilling the district\ncourt's duty to return the operations and control of schools to local authorities.\").\nCounsel for the Jenkins class conceded in the August conference before the district\n\n\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\fjudge that the planning has been completed and he anticipates no suggestion of\nadditional plans. What remains is the issue of the implementation of the plans in the\nfive areas of curriculum, classroom practices, professional development, assessment,\nand accountability, all of which relate solely to the remedying of the system wide\nreduction in student achievement and the narrowing of the achievement gap. This\nconcession significantly narrows the scope of the issues left for further judicial\nattention.\n\n       It should be observed that preparation of the plans, which requires effort by\neducational professionals, may be far simpler than implementation of the plans. This\ninvolves seeing that the plans ultimately have major impact in the classroom by\nteachers and administrators. The end result sought is an improvement in student\nachievement and reduction of the achievement gap. This is a people management issue\nrequiring substantial effort and dedication, and one of great complexity.\n\n      We have affirmed and given our support to the district court in taking steps to\nimprove student achievement and to reduce the achievement gap between black and\nwhite students in the Kansas City School District. Insofar as the Missouri State\nDepartment of Education shares this goal, it also has our support. Insofar as there may\nbe conflicting goals between the State Department of Education and the district court\norders, we believe that the district court should attempt to reconcile those goals so that\nimpediments to the achievement of the goals are removed.\n\n      The limited scope of the remaining issues must be a key element in further\nconsideration of this case by the district court. The district court must exercise its\njudgment and discretion, but it is our suggestion that the following issues be\nconsidered:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f       (1) Determine whether immediate declaration of unitary status as to all issues\nin the case but the narrowing of the achievement gap is desirable.\n\n       (2) The extent to which the district court's achievement standards and those of\nthe State can be reconciled and a single clearly understood standard be developed by\nthe court which is consistent with the State standard to the maximum extent practicable.\n\n       (3) Reevaluate appropriate procedures for monitoring or oversight of narrowing\nof the achievement gap.\n\n             (a) To what degree oversight is necessary. That oversight should\n      be narrowly tailored to successfully complete implementation of the five\n      plans.\n\n            (b) Appropriate methods or procedures, be it the desegregation\n      monitoring committee or some other instrumentality or method, for\n      continuation of the monitoring or oversight.\n\n             (c) Evaluate and assess the implementation of the five plans,\n      establishing a goal for achieving unitary status of each, and defining a\n      state of implementation of the plans that will allow consideration as to\n      whether there has been successful achievement of implementation. This\n      perhaps will require a determination as to whether a new and realistic\n      time frame is desired.\n\n       (4) Consider most carefully the role of court oversight so as to complement and\nnot conflict with the activities of the State with respect to educational improvement\nefforts.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f       We also believe the district court should view the role of further monitoring as\na protective role, overseeing the superintendent's activities and his staff in achieving\nsuccessful implementation of the plans. The district court recognized in particular the\npast micro-management, politicization and pursuing of personal agendas by the board.\nThe district in its briefs to this court recognized the necessity for negotiation of the\nassessment and accountability plans with the American Federation of Teachers. In\nmany of these areas such a role by judicial monitoring or oversight could lead to an\nearlier successful achievement of the implementation of these plans.\n\n      We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The\njudges of the Western District of Missouri should, in the manner they deem\nappropriate, designate another judge to preside over this litigation and do so\nimmediately so as to assure continuity in its management. The mandate shall issue\nforthwith.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f",

GIBSON, Circuit Judge.\n\n       The Jenkins class, representing the children of the Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict in this school desegregation case, has appealed the district court's order\ndeclaring the district unitary and dismissing the case with prejudice. The order\nfollowed a hearing set by the court to consider KCMSD's amended motion for equitable\nrelief from a ruling of the Missouri State Board of Education declaring that the\naccreditation of KCMSD would be withdrawn effective May 1, 2000. After the district\ncourt denied KCMSD's motion, it proceeded sua sponte to a discussion of the unitary\nstatus of the district and declared the district to be unitary. We reverse and remand.\n\n       We need not discuss in detail the long history of the Kansas City school\ndesegregation litigation. After a finding of constitutional violations, years of effort to\nremedy them, and extended litigation and appeals which we need not catalog, the State\nof Missouri moved for a declaration of unitary status. On March 27, 1997, Judge\nRussell Clark, who had presided over the case since its filing, granted the motion in\npart, but denied it in part. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151(W.D.Mo.), aff'd,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744825\"><a href=\"/opinion/744825/chinyere-jenkins-by-her-next-friend-joi-jenkins-nicholas-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1997) (Jenkins XIV). In particular, Judge Clark held that\ntwenty-six percent of the achievement gap of ten normalized curve equivalents between\nKCMSD's black and white students was a vestige of the constitutional violation, and\nhe ordered KCMSD to eradicate that vestige within the next three years. Id. at 1157-\n65, 1179. At the same time, Judge Clark approved a settlement between KCMSD and\nthe State, providing that the State would pay KCMSD $320 million over three years,\nand in return, would be dismissed from the litigation. Id. at 1180.\n\n       On January 28, 1999, the district judge who succeeded Judge Clark to\nsupervision of the case entered an order declaring that the State had paid its obligation\nunder the settlement and dismissing the State from the case. Order of January 28,\n1999. The court said that the State must continue to comply with any obligations that\nit undertook during the course of the lawsuit that were not covered by the agreement\n\n                                           -3-\n\fand warned the State against taking any action that might prevent KCMSD from\nultimately fulfilling its court-ordered remedial goals. Id. at 6. The court then pointed\nto Judge Clark's order giving KCMSD three years to eliminate all the remaining\nvestiges of segregation; the court commented that fifteen months remained on this time\nline. Id. After considering the \"lengthy and litigious process\" likely to attend a\nrenewed motion for unitary status, the court directed the parties to prepare for a unitary\nstatus hearing to begin on January 3, 2000. Id.\n\n       Counsel appeared before the court on August 24, 1999 for a scheduling\nconference, which the court stated was \"to address . . . preparing for a unitary status\nhearing in January,\" specifically what evidence the parties anticipated presenting in the\nhearing. Counsel for the class suggested delaying the hearing. He said that it would\nbe difficult for KCMSD to make a case that everything practicable had been done,\nbecause there was a \"pretty widely shared agreement that this is not the case.\"\nFurthermore, some test data were not in, and others seemed to show the achievement\ngap had not been closed. Nor had KCMSD implemented the curriculum, professional\ndevelopment, and accountability plans designed to close the gap. Also, KCMSD had\njust hired a new superintendent. The class's counsel suggested a hearing in the late\nsummer of 2000.\n\n       The court then pointed to Judge Clark's statement that gave the district three\nyears to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination, and stated he \"believed the Supreme\nCourt when they told me to get this school district returned to local control,\" and that\nboth he and Judge Clark had given KCMSD three years to comply.\n\n       Counsel for the class pointed out that recently the monitoring had been less\nheavy-handed, and that the monitoring committee, which was commonly referred to as\nthe DMC, had been sending things back to the new superintendent to handle. Counsel\nsaid there were many ways the committee could lighten its monitoring. Counsel for the\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fclass stated that he did not anticipate that he would be presenting new approaches or\nanything other than implementation of the five programs already planned for reducing\nthe black-white achievement gap: the curriculum, classroom practices, professional\ndevelopment, assessment, and accountability plans.\n\n       The district court then stated that he sensed that both the class and KCMSD\nwere \"pretty satisfied that the school district can't . . . go forward with the burden of\nproof that the gap has narrowed.\"1 He said he would need to have a hearing to take\ntestimony from one of the experts who testified at the earlier unitariness hearing and\nalso to hear whether the district was \"on track\" in implementing the five programs. The\ncourt commented that the problem had been the delay in implementation of the five\nplans to reduce the achievement gap. The court further commented that the track\nrecord of the district had not convinced him that KCMSD was putting heart and soul\nbehind implementing the five areas or that KCMSD could get out of the political mode\nand get into looking for the best interests of the children.\n\n      Following this conference, the court filed a written order formally denying the\nmotion for a continuance, stating:\n\n      [T]he Court provided for termination of the [DMC] by March 25, 2000.\n      See Order at 21, Doc. # 4575 (August 21, 1997), . . . . [E]ven if the\n      KCMSD has not attained unitary status, all three Monitors would be\n      removed. See id. At that time, the Court would need to determine the\n      need for new Monitors or even a new remedial structure. Such a\n\n\n      1\n        This statement came after the following exchange. When the class counsel said\nin court there was \"widely shared agreement\" that KCMSD had not done everything\npracticable to eradicate the achievement gap, KCMSD did not object to this\nrepresentation. KCMSD's counsel said: \"[W]e have a sense at the moment . . . that\nthe district would have an uphill fight in January.\"\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      determination cannot be made without evidence of the KCMSD's current\n      status.\n\nOrder of August 26, 1999 at 17-18 (emphasis added).\n\n       On October 21, 1999, the State Board of Education voted to withdraw\naccreditation of KCMSD as of May 1, 2000. In response, KCMSD filed an amended\nmotion for equitable relief on October 25, 1999, seeking to bar the State's action on the\nground that it would interfere with the remedial decree in Jenkins. That same day, the\ncourt issued an order setting KCMSD's motion for hearing on November 1 to hear\nevidence on three enumerated issues: whether the court should (1) rejoin the State as\na party; (2) declare void ab initio the action of the Missouri State Board of Education\nin classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district; and (3) enjoin the application\nto KCMSD of several statutes on which the State Board's action was based.2\n\n       The court held the hearing on KCMSD's motion on November 1-2, 1999. We\nneed not discuss in detail the testimony before the court, except to state that it was\ndirected to the issues outlined by the district court in its order of October 25. The\nparties agreed in oral argument before us that the hearing was not a unitary status\nhearing. At the conclusion of the proceedings of November 2, the court asked\nKCMSD's staff counsel whether the KCMSD board agreed there should be a unitary\nstatus hearing in January. Counsel responded that the board voted unanimously to seek\na continuance and authorized her to agree to a continuation of the monitoring\ncommittee in its current configuration until the end of the 1999-2000 academic year in\nJune.\n\n\n\n      2\n       In KCMSD's motion for relief from the de-accreditation action, it asked the\ncourt to stay the de-accreditation until the five remedial plans had been fully\nimplemented.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f       On November 9, 1999, KCMSD filed a written motion requesting a continuance\nof the unitary status hearing set for January 3, 2000, and consenting to continued\nsupervision by the DMC. KCMSD further suggested that it would be appropriate to\nextend the term limits of the DMC beyond March 25, 2000, and to set a hearing at the\nend of the academic school year, June 3, 2000, to assess the role of the DMC and\nconsider a reduction in the scope of the oversight by that body in the future.\n\n       On November 17 the district court issued an order denying KCMSD's request to\nrejoin the State as a party and refusing to declare void ab initio the action of the State\nBoard of Education classifying KCMSD as an unaccredited school district.3 After ruling\non the motion before it, the court proceeded sua sponte to consider the issue of whether\nthe district was unitary. In light of the nature of our ruling, it is not necessary that we\nset out in detail the substance of the court's reasoning. Suffice it to say that, much to the\nparties' surprise, the court ended by declaring that the KCMSD had achieved unitary\nstatus. The court dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       We first consider whether the district court erred in determining KCMSD to be\nunitary and dismissing the case without taking evidence or hearing arguments on the\nissue.\n\n      In January 1999 the court scheduled a hearing on unitary status for January 2000,\nand both in a conference with counsel and a written order in August 1999 commented\n\n       3\n        The district court's ruling on the de-accreditation question is not before us. The\nState argued before the district court that the action of the State Board of Education is\neffective May 1, 2000 and that the KCMSD has not exhausted its administrative\nremedies. KCMSD conceded that its administrative appeal rights were not yet\nexhausted and were not yet ripe.\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fspecifically on the necessity for a hearing to evaluate what continuing judicial\ninvolvement would be required. The order setting the November 1-2, 1999 hearing\nlimited that hearing to the issues of whether the State should be rejoined as a party and\nwhether the de-accreditation order should be declared void ab initio. The transcript\ndiscloses that the testimony and evidence at the hearing were directed to these issues.\nThe court's inquiry at the conclusion of the November 1-2 hearing as to whether there\nshould be a unitary status hearing in January demonstrates that the court did not consider\nit had conducted such a hearing. KCMSD's counsel's response to this inquiry by the\ncourt and its written motion filed November 9, 1999 for a continuance of the unitariness\nhearing demonstrate that KCMSD did not consider that there had been a hearing on\nunitary status.\n\n       It is evident from what we have said above that KCMSD did nothing to contest\nthe Jenkins class's statements that neither KCMSD nor the class were ready to move\nforward and establish that KCMSD was unitary, and the judge acknowledged as much.\nFrom this and from the court's order limiting the proof at the November 1-2 hearing, the\nJenkins class as well as KCMSD went into the hearing with no expectation that unitary\nstatus was an issue to be tried.\n\n      In Jenkins XIV we held, based upon abundant Supreme Court authority, that once\nthere has been a finding that a defendant established an unlawful dual school system in\nthe past, there is a presumption that current disparities of the sort listed in Green v.\nCounty School Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435 (1968), are the result of the defendant's\nunconstitutional conduct. See Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 593. Therefore, the burden of\nproving unitariness rests on the constitutional violator. Id. at 593-95. Our statement in\nJenkins XIV found support in Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (1992), where the\nSupreme Court stated with respect to racial imbalance in student attendance caused by\nthe unlawful policy of a school system, \"The School District bears the burden of\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fshowing that any current imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior\nviolation.\" Other statements in Freeman similarly recognized that the burden was on the\ndistrict to demonstrate a good faith commitment to compliance with the desegregation\nplan. Id. at 498-99. This presumption places the burden in any hearing on unitary status\non KCMSD, including the issue of reduction in student achievement and the\nachievement gap, and it admittedly made no attempt to demonstrate that unitary status\nhad been achieved.4\n\n       This court stated in Booker v. Special School District No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360236\"><a href=\"/opinion/360236/jeanette-booker-by-curtis-c-chivers-her-grandfather-and-guardian-ad/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352\n(8th Cir. 1978), \"There is no question that in a proper case a federal district court that\nhas issued an injunction may vacate it or modify it if it is established that to continue it\nin force or without modification would work an inequitable result.\" (emphasis added.)\n\n       The Seventh Circuit faced a nearly identical situation in United States v. Board\nof School Commissioners, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747640\"><a href=\"/opinion/747640/united-states-v-board-of-school-commissioners-of-the-city-of-indianapolis/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1997). There, the Board of School\nCommissioners of the Indianapolis Public School District requested that the judge lift\nan injunction requiring busing of public school students on the ground that the district\nhad achieved unitary status.5 The district court declined to address the issue of unitary\n\n\n       4\n        In Jenkins XIV, we pointed to the finding of the district court in the first\nremedial order decisions that \"the inferior education indigenous of the state-compelled\ndual school system has lingering effects in the Kansas City, Missouri School District.\"\n122 F.3d at 594. We also quoted a later finding, \"Segregation has caused a system\nwide reduction in student achievement in the schools of the KCMSD.\" Id. (emphasis\nin original). The district court found that the adverse effect on minority student\nachievement still persisted in 1997 in the form of an achievement gap; we held that\nfinding was not clearly erroneous. 122 F.3d at 597-99.\n       5\n       The Seventh Circuit's opinion stated that the district wanting to phase out can\nbe permitted to do so only by presenting evidence that the existing order had outlived\n\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fstatus, but modified its existing order by extending the busing to kindergartners, an issue\nthat had not been raised by the parties. The Seventh Circuit, in an opinion by Chief\nJudge Posner, stated:\n\n      No one asked the judge for this modification; there was no hearing on it.\n      As a result, there is nothing in the judge's order, or in the record on which\n      it is based, about the respective kindergarten programs, facilities, and\n      capacities in the transferor and transferee areas or about the\n      appropriateness of compelling the busing of such young children against\n      their parents' wishes and whether they are to be in the same buses with\n      much older children.\n\n128 F.3d at 512. In support of the court's order that they, like KCMSD here, did not\nseek in the first place, the appellees pointed out that the district judge had \"learned a\nlot about public school education in Marion County in the thirty years that he has been\npresiding over this litigation.\" Id. The Seventh Circuit responded:\n\n      [G]reat knowledge is a temptation as well as a resource: a temptation to\n      blur the separation of powers, to shift the balance between the federal\n      courts and state and local government too far toward the courts, and to\n      disregard procedural niceties, all in fulfillment of a confident sense of\n      mission.\n\nId.\n\n      Although the Seventh Circuit was dealing with expansion of a remedy and we\ndeal with the elimination of one, the principle is the same: procedural niceties equate\nwith due process and must be afforded the parties. As the Seventh Circuit vacated the\n\n\n\nits usefulness. 128 F.3d at 510.\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fsua sponte order and remanded for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing, so\nshould we.\n\n        Counsel for KCMSD conceded that the court's ruling was on a ground not argued\nby the parties, but insisted that the court was thinking ahead of KCMSD. Having\nachieved its unexpected release from litigation, KCMSD hastens to give support to the\nruling.\n\n       KCMSD argues that the district court did not err in declaring KCMSD unitary\nwithout benefit of notice, hearing, argument, or other evidentiary presentation.\nKCMSD cites Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106449\"><a href=\"/opinion/106449/link-v-wabash-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1962), for the principle that\n\"Parties are not always entitled to a hearing.\" Link has little, if any, relevance to this\ncase. In Link, the district court set a pretrial conference and notified counsel. When\nthe lawyer for the plaintiff did not appear at the time set, the court dismissed the action\nfor failure to appear and failure to prosecute. Id. at 629. Link did no more than rule\nthat the dismissal for failure to prosecute was not an abuse of discretion. Id. at 633.\n\n       Link is about sanctions, not about what opportunity parties should be given to\npresent evidence and make argument before a ruling on the merits of their case. It\ncertainly is not about the proper procedure for dismissal of a school desegregation case\nin which a school district has been adjudged liable for constitutional violations and\nsubjected to a remedial decree. However, Link does have some general applicability\nto this case insofar as it discussed the circumstances that can justify entry of an order\nwithout the opportunity to be heard: \"The adequacy of notice and hearing respecting\nproceedings that may affect a party's rights turns, to a considerable extent, on the\nknowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to have of the\nconsequences of his own conduct.\" 370 U.S. at 332. Unlike Link, where the attorney\nhad notice of the pretrial conference, and should have known that his failure to appear\n\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fwould have consequences, in this case there was no notice to any of the parties, either\nconstitutional violator or victims, that the issue of unitary status was to be considered\nand decided at the November hearing. To the contrary, there was every assurance that\nunitary status would not be considered until the scheduled January 2000 hearing, and\nKCMSD's requests for continuance strongly suggested that it would not even be in a\nposition to contend that the district was unitary in January 2000. Link certainly\ndemonstrates that simple fairness would require notice and hearing before a decision\nthat dismisses the case.\n\n       At oral argument, KCMSD's counsel suggested that the Jenkins class had the\nopportunity to present evidence on the unitariness question at the hearing on the class's\nmotion to stay the dismissal pending appeal. The opportunity to argue a stay motion,\nwith the class having the burden on four discrete issues which placed the constitutional\nvictims in the position of arguing that the horse should be put back in the barn, should\nnot substitute for a chance to present evidence and argue the merits in a hearing called\nfor that purpose.\n\n       The sua sponte ruling declaring the district unitary and releasing the admitted\nconstitutional violator from further court supervision, without giving notice either to the\nconstitutional violator or the victims or permitting the parties to present evidence and\nargue these issues, was error.\n\n                                            II.\n\n      Although we do not reach the merits of the unitariness issue, we think it\nappropriate to comment on some issues the district court will face on remand.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f        The testimony at the hearing focused on the impact of the de-accreditation order,\nwhich Dr. John Murphy, a member of the DMC, described as a death knell, and\nSuperintendent Benjamin Demps6 described as a train wreck. Whatever description is\napplied, it was a resounding statement, of thunderclap proportions, that KCMSD had\nnot been successful in dealing with the system wide reduction in student achievement,\nmuch less the achievement gap. In addition, there was considerable evidence about the\neffect of the establishment of some fifteen charter schools, unaccredited and not subject\nto state control, which had siphoned off more than 3,000 students from KCMSD. This\nresulted in KCMSD suffering a financial loss in the millions of dollars the law required\nbe paid to the charter schools. These developments, the result of state action, have\nplaced KCMSD in a most difficult situation, according to both Superintendent Demps\nand Dr. Murphy, in working to deal with the difficult educational problems KCMSD\nfaces.\n\n       The district court commented that many of the hurdles that are presented to the\nplan and to unitary status are not constitutional violations. Order of November 17,\n1999 at 36. This misses the point. Hurdles and obstacles to eliminating the vestiges\nof the past dual school system are properly the subject of attention by the court and\nmay be addressed by injunctive order, if needed. Limitations on a school authority's\ndiscretion that impede the disestablishing of a dual school system must fall. North\nCarolina State Board of Educ. v.

The record demonstrates that there was considerable enthusiasm\nat his assuming the reins of leadership of KCMSD after a period of frequent\nreplacement of Superintendents. Superintendent Demps had significant management\nexperience in federal and state government.\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fthe Supreme Court in Jenkins v. Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112414\"><a href=\"/opinion/112414/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57-58 (1990). The court has\nthe obligation to vindicate federal constitutional guarantees and to take what action is\nnecessary for this purpose. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 495 U.S. at 57-58.\n\n       The district court expressed most positively that he was guided by the three-year\nlimitation set by Judge Clark in March 1997, and he had adopted this as his own\nlimitation as well. Judge Clark's order, however, while establishing the three-year\nlimitation, was unable to say with absolute certainty that KCMSD would have attained\nunitary status in that time, and recognized that some thought five years might be\nneeded. 959 F. Supp. at 1179. In affirming this order of Judge Clark's, we commented\nthat the three-year time table was an optimistic prediction, see 122 F.3d at 601, and the\nfigure was not susceptible of precise calculation. Id. at 602. It is significant that the\nthree-year period has seen the termination of one superintendent of schools, the hiring\nof another, the later buyout of his contract, and the search for and hiring of the present\nsuperintendent.\n\n       Superintendent Demps stated that the district is currently undertaking efforts to\nreduce the achievement gap, which included instructional methodology and\nprofessional development, but he said this has not moved far since he came on board.\nSuperintendent Demps further testified that the district is in the process of\nimplementing the core curriculum; however, he had heard from Cheryl Shannon, Chief\nof Staff of KCMSD, that the curriculum was not aligned with the Missouri Show-Me\nStandards. There was a difference of opinion on this, and they were going to see to it\nthat the court-ordered curriculum was properly aligned with the State's new Show-Me\nStandards.\n\n      Shannon stated that there was work remaining to be done toward implementation\nof the programs ordered to reduce the achievement gap. Implementation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fprofessional development and assessment plans had begun, but there were hurdles\nremaining toward getting those plans up and running in part caused by vacancies in key\npositions. Further, the accountability plan had not been completely developed or\naccepted, and several scripts had not been developed, including those for teacher,\nprincipal, school, and central office evaluation. Shannon believed that the de-\naccreditation decision would risk further delay in implementing the various plans.\n\n       Superintendent Demps identified the accountability plan as a major part of the\nimprovement program. Counsel informed this court at argument that not even a pilot\nprogram would be in place until the academic year 2000-01, and full implementation\ncould not occur before the 2001-02 academic year. KCMSD's brief acknowledged that\n\"teacher acceptance of the court-approved accountability plan is certain to be among\nthe [topics for the] District's upcoming negotiations.\" A question obviously exists\nabout not only the time frame, but also implementation of the accountability program.\n\n       It is also of significance that the March 27 termination of the desegregation\nmonitoring committee and the de-accreditation effective date fall in the middle of the\nschool year. Superintendent Demps expressed his deep concern about this, and we\nshare this concern about the effect of an arbitrarily selected cut-off date bifurcating a\nschool year.\n\n       The order of the district court in dismissing the action viewed the question as an\nall-or-nothing proposition. Yet, the Supreme Court has recognized that gradual and\nincremental withdrawal of the court's supervision may be most appropriate. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 489 (\"Partial relinquishment of judicial control, where justified\nby the facts of the case, can be an important and significant step in fulfilling the district\ncourt's duty to return the operations and control of schools to local authorities.\").\nCounsel for the Jenkins class conceded in the August conference before the district\n\n\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\fjudge that the planning has been completed and he anticipates no suggestion of\nadditional plans. What remains is the issue of the implementation of the plans in the\nfive areas of curriculum, classroom practices, professional development, assessment,\nand accountability, all of which relate solely to the remedying of the system wide\nreduction in student achievement and the narrowing of the achievement gap. This\nconcession significantly narrows the scope of the issues left for further judicial\nattention.\n\n       It should be observed that preparation of the plans, which requires effort by\neducational professionals, may be far simpler than implementation of the plans. This\ninvolves seeing that the plans ultimately have major impact in the classroom by\nteachers and administrators. The end result sought is an improvement in student\nachievement and reduction of the achievement gap. This is a people management issue\nrequiring substantial effort and dedication, and one of great complexity.\n\n      We have affirmed and given our support to the district court in taking steps to\nimprove student achievement and to reduce the achievement gap between black and\nwhite students in the Kansas City School District. Insofar as the Missouri State\nDepartment of Education shares this goal, it also has our support. Insofar as there may\nbe conflicting goals between the State Department of Education and the district court\norders, we believe that the district court should attempt to reconcile those goals so that\nimpediments to the achievement of the goals are removed.\n\n      The limited scope of the remaining issues must be a key element in further\nconsideration of this case by the district court. The district court must exercise its\njudgment and discretion, but it is our suggestion that the following issues be\nconsidered:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f       (1) Determine whether immediate declaration of unitary status as to all issues\nin the case but the narrowing of the achievement gap is desirable.\n\n       (2) The extent to which the district court's achievement standards and those of\nthe State can be reconciled and a single clearly understood standard be developed by\nthe court which is consistent with the State standard to the maximum extent practicable.\n\n       (3) Reevaluate appropriate procedures for monitoring or oversight of narrowing\nof the achievement gap.\n\n             (a) To what degree oversight is necessary. That oversight should\n      be narrowly tailored to successfully complete implementation of the five\n      plans.\n\n            (b) Appropriate methods or procedures, be it the desegregation\n      monitoring committee or some other instrumentality or method, for\n      continuation of the monitoring or oversight.\n\n             (c) Evaluate and assess the implementation of the five plans,\n      establishing a goal for achieving unitary status of each, and defining a\n      state of implementation of the plans that will allow consideration as to\n      whether there has been successful achievement of implementation. This\n      perhaps will require a determination as to whether a new and realistic\n      time frame is desired.\n\n       (4) Consider most carefully the role of court oversight so as to complement and\nnot conflict with the activities of the State with respect to educational improvement\nefforts.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f       We also believe the district court should view the role of further monitoring as\na protective role, overseeing the superintendent's activities and his staff in achieving\nsuccessful implementation of the plans. The district court recognized in particular the\npast micro-management, politicization and pursuing of personal agendas by the board.\nThe district in its briefs to this court recognized the necessity for negotiation of the\nassessment and accountability plans with the American Federation of Teachers. In\nmany of these areas such a role by judicial monitoring or oversight could lead to an\nearlier successful achievement of the implementation of these plans.\n\n      We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The\njudges of the Western District of Missouri should, in the manner they deem\nappropriate, designate another judge to preside over this litigation and do so\nimmediately so as to assure continuity in its management. The mandate shall issue\nforthwith.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f</pre>",
