Corbin R. Davis\n\n\n                       SPEICHER v COLUMBIA TOWNSHIP BOARD OF TRUSTEES\n\n       Docket No. 148617. Argued October 8, 2014. Decided December 22, 2014.\n\n               Kenneth J. Speicher brought an action against the Columbia Township Board of Trustees\n       and the Columbia Township Planning Commission in the Van Buren Circuit Court, seeking\n       declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis of defendants’ alleged violations of the Open\n       Meetings Act (OMA), MCL 15.261 et seq. The trial court, Paul E. Hamre, J., granted summary\n       disposition in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed. In an unpublished opinion issued January\n       22, 2013, the Court of Appeals, WILDER, P.J., and O’CONNELL and K. F. KELLY, JJ., affirmed the\n       trial court’s denial of injunctive relief but reversed its denial of declaratory relief and remanded\n       the case for further proceedings, specifying that because the technical nature of the OMA\n       violation did not warrant injunctive relief, plaintiff was not entitled to attorney fees or costs\n       under MCL 15.271(4). Plaintiff moved for reconsideration. On December 19, 2013, the Court\n       of Appeals granted the motion, vacating that part of the opinion that had addressed attorney fees.\n       On reconsideration, the Court of Appeals held that under binding caselaw interpreting the OMA,\n       plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees and costs because he had succeeded in obtaining relief.\n       The Court of Appeals added that absent that caselaw, the panel would have held that attorney\n       fees and costs are available under MCL 15.271(4) only to plaintiffs who request and obtain\n       injunctive relief. 303 Mich App 475 (2013). The panel called for the convening of a special\n       panel under MCR 7.215(J)(3) to address the issue. The Court of Appeals declined to convene\n       the special panel. Defendants sought leave to appeal. The Supreme Court ordered and heard\n       oral argument on whether to grant the application for leave to appeal or take other peremptory\n       action. 496 Mich 852 (2014).\n\n            In an opinion by Justice VIVIANO, joined by Chief Justice YOUNG and Justices\n       MARKMAN, KELLY, ZAHRA, and MCCORMACK, the Supreme Court held:\n\n               Prior decisions of the Court of Appeals strayed from the plain language of\n       MCL 15.271(4). A person may not recover court costs or attorney fees under the plain language\n       of that statute unless he or she succeeds in obtaining injunctive relief, overruling Ridenour v\n       Dearborn Bd of Ed, 111 Mich App 798 (1981), and its progeny to the extent that those cases\n       allowed the recovery of attorney fees and costs under MCL 15.271(4) when injunctive relief was\n       not obtained.\n\n              1. If a public body is not complying with the OMA, and a person commences a civil\n       action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel compliance or to enjoin further\n\fnoncompliance with the act and succeeds in obtaining relief in the action, the person shall\nrecover court costs and actual attorney fees for the action. The first statutory condition—if a\npublic body is not complying with the act—contemplates an ongoing violation, precisely the\ncircumstances in which injunctive relief is appropriate. The second statutory condition—\ncommencement of a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\ncompliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with the act—requires that the person seek\ninjunctive relief. The third statutory condition—a requirement that a person who files an action\nseeking such relief succeeds in obtaining relief in the action—cannot be separated from the\nphrase that precedes it. Given that the phrase “relief in the action,” uses a definite article and\nimmediately follows the phrase “a person commences a civil action against the public body for\ninjunctive relief,” the phrase “relief in the action” must be construed as referring to injunctive\nrelief. The Legislature was not required to restate the modifier “injunctive” when again referring\nto the noun “relief” because the modifier is implied when the statute is read as a whole. When\nread in the context of the statutory scheme, MCL 15.271 limits the award of attorney fees to\ncases in which the public body persists in violating the act, a suit is brought to enjoin that\nbehavior, and that suit is successful in obtaining injunctive relief. There is no allowance in the\nstatute for obtaining the equivalent of relief; the plaintiff must obtain injunctive relief, as sought\nin commencing the action.\n\n        2. In this case, the trial court and the Court of Appeals agreed that plaintiff failed to show\nthat he was entitled to injunctive relief because there was no evidence that the commission had a\nhistory of OMA violations, there was no evidence that this violation was willful, and there was\nno evidence that the public or plaintiff was harmed. Therefore, while the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief for defendants’ notice violation, he was\nnot entitled to court costs and attorney fees because he did not succeed in obtaining injunctive\nrelief.\n\n        Court of Appeals opinion and order issued December 19, 2013, reversed; portion of the\nCourt of Appeals opinion issued January 22, 2013, concerning court costs and attorney fees\nreinstated.\n\n       Justice CAVANAGH, dissenting, would have held that plaintiff was entitled to costs and\nattorney fees. Shortly after the enactment of the OMA, the Court of Appeals effectively held that\ndeclaratory relief granted in lieu of or as the functional equivalent of an injunction supports an\naward of costs and attorney fees under MCL 15.271(4). The Court of Appeals has reiterated that\nholding in numerous published opinions over a period of more than 30 years. Despite the clear\nholdings of the Court of Appeals, the Legislature has not taken any action to signal its\ndisapproval of that line of cases. The Legislature’s silence is a strong indication that the Court of\nAppeals properly effectuated the Legislature’s intent. The Court of Appeals’ interpretation,\nmoreover, was consistent with the purpose of MCL 15.271(4) in particular and the OMA more\nbroadly. In the context of public bodies, a judgment for declaratory relief is the functional\nequivalent of an injunction in that it restrains the public body from further noncompliance with\nthe OMA. The majority’s interpretation, in contrast, undermines the OMA’s enforcement\nprovision and the purpose of the OMA generally, and will curtail the ability of private citizens to\nbring OMA complaints.\n\n                                     ©2014 State of Michigan\n\f                                                                           Michigan Supreme Court\n                                                                                 Lansing, Michigan\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n                                                     Chief Justice:          Justices:\n                                                     Robert P.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that prior\n\ndecisions of that court have strayed from the plain language of MCL 15.271(4).\n\nTherefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals opinion and order issued December 19, 2013,\n\nand reinstate the portion of its January 22, 2013 decision regarding court costs and actual\n\nattorney fees.\n\n                      I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        In early 2010, the Columbia Township Board of Trustees (the Board) adopted a\n\nresolution that fixed the regular monthly meetings of the Board and the Columbia\n\nTownship Planning Commission (the Planning Commission) for the year 2010-2011.\n\nHowever, during the regularly scheduled October 18, 2010 meeting, the Planning\n\nCommission adopted another resolution that it would conduct quarterly, rather than\n\nmonthly, meetings beginning January 2011. According to the Township Clerk, after the\n\nPlanning Commission adopted the new schedule, she contacted a local newspaper, the\n\nSouth Haven Tribune, and requested publication of the new meeting schedule. She stated\n\nthat she also posted a revised meeting schedule at the Township Hall entrance with the\n\nFebruary and March 2011 meetings whited out.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    MCR 7.215(J).\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f         Plaintiff is a property owner in the township. According to plaintiff, he had no\n\nnotice of the new quarterly meeting schedule, and he appeared for the meetings in\n\nFebruary and March 2011, seeking to raise a number of issues before the Planning\n\nCommission. Plaintiff claimed that the posted schedule did not reflect the change to\n\nquarterly meetings and no notices appeared in the South Haven Tribune prior to those\n\npreviously scheduled meetings.\n\n         Plaintiff sued defendants, alleging that the decision to change the schedule was not\n\nmade at an open meeting3 and that the February and March meetings were canceled\n\nwithout proper notice in violation of the OMA.4 Plaintiff alleged that, as a result of the\n\nmeetings not being held, his right to present certain concerns to the Planning Commission\n\nwas impaired.5 Plaintiff sought a declaration that the Planning Commission’s decision to\n\n\n\n3\n MCL 15.263(2) requires that “[a]ll decisions of a public body shall be made at a\nmeeting open to the public.”\n4\n MCL 15.265(3) requires that public notice of changes to regularly scheduled meetings\nbe “posted within 3 days after the meeting at which the change is made[.]”\n5\n    This allegation appears to refer to MCL 15.270(2), which provides as follows:\n\n                A decision made by a public body may be invalidated if the public\n         body has not complied with the requirements of section 3\n         [MCL 15.263](1), (2), and (3) in making the decision or if failure to give\n         notice in accordance with section 5 [MCL 15.265] has interfered with\n         substantial compliance with section 3(1), (2), and (3) and the court finds\n         that the noncompliance or failure has impaired the rights of the public\n         under this act.\n\nHowever, plaintiff has specifically disclaimed that he sought to invalidate defendants’\ndecision under that provision, stating that “[t]he damage had been done and invalidation\nunder MCL 15.270 was simply not available.”\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fcancel the regularly scheduled meetings was made in violation of the OMA, and he\n\nsought to enjoin the Planning Commission and the Board from further noncompliance\n\nwith the OMA.6 Plaintiff also cited MCL 15.271(4) and alleged that “if this Court grants\n\nrelief as a result of this complaint, [plaintiff] shall recover court costs and actual attorney\n\nfees for this action.”\n\n       Finding that defendants’ conduct was not actionable, the trial court denied\n\nplaintiff’s motion for summary disposition and granted summary disposition to\n\ndefendants. The trial court also denied plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration. The trial\n\ncourt ruled that defendants did not violate the OMA because plaintiff was not denied\n\naccess to any meetings. To the extent that notice may not have been timely posted, this\n\nwas a technical violation not entitling plaintiff to relief. The trial court acknowledged\n\nthat the notice cancelling the February and March Planning Commission meetings “may\n\nnot have been done in strict compliance with” the OMA, but the court concluded that any\n\nviolations were “technical in nature, and did not impair the rights of the public in having\n\ntheir governmental bodies make decisions in an open meeting.” Plaintiff had, at most,\n\nbeen inconvenienced by the failure to post timely notice of the meeting changes given\n\nthat “[p]laintiff had the option of bringing his concerns to the Planning Commission at its\n\nnext regularly scheduled meeting.”\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Plaintiff clarified in a later pleading that his claim for injunctive relief was premised on\nthe Board’s prior violation of the OMA during the selection of a new township fire chief.\nSee Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, unpublished opinion per curiam of the\nCourt of Appeals, issued February 25, 2014 (Docket No. 313158).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f          Plaintiff appealed in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in part and reversed in\n\npart in an unpublished opinion.7 The Court of Appeals concluded that while the meeting\n\nschedule change was properly made at an open meeting, defendants plainly violated the\n\nOMA by not timely posting the modified schedule. It therefore held that the trial court\n\nerred by failing to grant declaratory relief to plaintiff on that point. However, the Court\n\nof Appeals also held that the trial court properly denied injunctive relief for defendants’\n\ntechnical notice violation because “there was no evidence that the Commission had a\n\nhistory of OMA violations, there was no evidence that this violation was done willfully,”\n\nand there was no evidence that the public or plaintiff was harmed in any manner.8 The\n\nCourt of Appeals therefore ruled that “given that the technical nature of this OMA\n\nviolation resulted in no injunctive relief being warranted, plaintiff is not entitled to any\n\nattorney fees or costs under MCL 15.271(4) on remand.”9\n\n          Plaintiff moved for reconsideration, arguing that because the Court of Appeals had\n\nheld that he was entitled to declaratory relief under the OMA, he was entitled to an award\n\nof court costs and actual attorney fees under MCL 15.271(4). The Court of Appeals\n\ngranted reconsideration and vacated the portion of its unpublished opinion regarding\n\nattorney fees.10 In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals then held that plaintiff was\n\n7\n Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court\nof Appeals, issued January 22, 2013 (Docket No. 306684).\n8\n  Id. at 2. The Court of Appeals pointed out that plaintiff was able to present his concerns\nto the Commission at the December 2010, January 2011, and April 2011 meetings.\n9\n    Id.\n10\n  Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals,\nentered December 19, 2013 (Docket No. 306684).\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fentitled to court costs and actual attorney fees under existing case law because he\n\nestablished entitlement to declaratory relief.11 However, the Court of Appeals reached\n\nthis conclusion only because it was bound by court rule to follow prior published Court\n\nof Appeals decisions.12 The Court explained that the rule that court costs and actual\n\nattorney fees were available whenever a plaintiff files a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief\n\nunder MCL 15.271 and obtains some form of relief had developed from the\n\nmisapplication of a prior Court of Appeals decision issued in 1981, Ridenour v Dearborn\n\nBd of Ed.13 However, the Court determined that this rule was unsupported by the plain\n\nlanguage of MCL 15.271(4) and that the cases that developed this rule often did not\n\nprovide any substantive analysis.14 Were the Court of Appeals free to decide the issue as\n\n11\n   Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, 303 Mich App 475, 476-477; 843 NW2d 770\n(2013). We note that the Court of Appeals also stated that “plaintiff did not request\nattorney fees at the trial court or in his claim of appeal.” Id. at 477. But our review of the\nrecord proves that statement to be inaccurate. Plaintiff initiated his request for attorney\nfees in his complaint and reiterated that request in briefing on his motion for summary\ndisposition and claim of appeal. Thus, this issue is preserved.\n12\n  Id. at 476-477, citing MCR 7.215(J)(1) (“A panel of the Court of Appeals must follow\nthe rule of law established by a prior published decision of the Court of Appeals issued\non or after November 1, 1990, that has not been reversed or modified by the Supreme\nCourt, or by a special panel of the Court of Appeals as provided in this rule.”).\n13\n   Speicher, 303 Mich App at 482, citing Ridenour v Dearborn Bd of Ed, 111 Mich App\n798; 314 NW2d 760 (1981). In Ridenour, the trial court did not find it necessary to grant\ninjunctive relief because of the defense attorney’s promise that the defendant would abide\nby the court’s ruling. Ridenour, 111 Mich App at 801. The trial court nevertheless\nawarded the plaintiff court costs and actual attorney fees because he obtained “the\nequivalent of an injunction,” and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Issues of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.17 In interpreting a statute,\n\nwe consider “both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as its\n\nplacement and purpose in the statutory scheme.”18 As with any statutory interpretation,\n\nour goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature by focusing on the statute’s plain\n\nlanguage.19\n\n                                       III. ANALYSIS\n\n         At issue in this case is the proper interpretation of the phrase “succeeds in\n\nobtaining relief in the action” in MCL 15.271(4). This Court has not yet addressed\n\nwhether that phrase refers to injunctive relief, as defendants contend and the Court of\n\nAppeals panel would have held, or to any relief, as plaintiff contends and the Ridenour\n\nline of cases have held.20 Unlike the Court of Appeals below, we are not bound by the\n\nprior Court of Appeals decisions. Therefore, we are able to independently assess the\n\nrelevant statutory language to determine whether the Court of Appeals has properly\n\ninterpreted MCL 15.271(4). For the reasons stated below, we agree with defendants and\n\n\n17\n  Eggleston v Bio-Medical Applications of Detroit, Inc, 468 Mich 29, 32; 658 NW2d 139\n(2003).\n18\n  Estate of Shinholster v Annapolis Hosp, 471 Mich 540, 549; 685 NW2d 275 (2004)\n(quotation marks and citations omitted).\n19\n     Malpass v Dep’t of Treasury, 494 Mich 237, 247-248; 833 NW2d 272 (2013).\n20\n   In Omdahl v West Iron Co Bd of Ed, 478 Mich 423; 733 NW2d 380 (2007), this Court\naddressed the language of MCL 15.271(4), but the plaintiff there sought and obtained\ninjunctive relief, and the issue was limited to whether a pro se litigant, who is also an\nattorney, may recover court costs and actual attorney fees.\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fthe Court of Appeals panel that court costs and actual attorney fees under MCL 15.271\n\nmay only be awarded when a plaintiff seeks and obtains injunctive relief.\n\n        Under the OMA, public bodies must conduct their meetings, make all of their\n\ndecisions, and conduct their deliberations (when a quorum is present) at meetings open to\n\nthe public.21    The OMA also requires public bodies to give notice of their regular\n\nmeetings and changes in their meeting schedule in the manner prescribed by the act.22 If\n\na public body has failed to comply with the requirements of the act, in addition to\n\nauthorizing enforcement actions by the attorney general or local prosecuting attorney, the\n\nOMA also allows for any person to commence a civil action.23 The OMA creates a three-\n\ntiered enforcement scheme for private litigants:\n\n        (1)     Section 10 of the OMA allows a person to file a civil suit “to challenge the\n\nvalidity of a decision of a public body made in violation of this act.”24 Subsection (2)\n\nspecifies when a decision may be invalidated, and Subsection (5) allows a public body to\n\ncure the alleged defect by reenacting a disputed decision in conformity with the OMA.\n\nNotably, § 10 does not provide for an award of attorney fees or costs.\n\n        (2)     If a public body is not complying with the OMA, § 11 allows a person to\n\nfile a civil suit “to compel compliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with this act.”25\n\n21\n     MCL 15.263.\n22\n     MCL 15.265.\n23\n     MCL 15.270; MCL 15.271; MCL 15.273.\n24\n     MCL 15.270(1).\n25\n     MCL 15.271(1).\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fSubsection (4) provides for an award of court costs and actual attorney fees when three\n\nconditions are met: (a) a public body is not complying with the act; (b) a person files “a\n\ncivil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel compliance or enjoin\n\nfurther noncompliance with the act”; and (c) the person “succeeds in obtaining relief in\n\nthe action[.]”26 The meaning of this latter phrase is the crux of this case.\n\n         (3)    Finally, § 13 provides that a public official who intentionally violates the\n\nOMA is “personally liable in a civil action for actual or exemplary damages of not more\n\nthan $500.00 total, plus court costs and actual attorney fees . . . .”27\n\n         As an initial matter, “these sections, and the distinct kinds of relief that they\n\nprovide, stand alone.”28 This is an important point because “[t]o determine whether a\n\nplaintiff may bring a cause of action for a specific remedy, this Court must determine\n\nwhether [the Legislature] intended to create such a cause of action.”29 When a statute,\n\nlike the OMA, “gives new rights and prescribes new remedies, such remedies must be\n\nstrictly pursued; and a party seeking a remedy under the act is confined to the remedy\n\nconferred thereby and to that only.”30\n\n\n\n\n26\n     MCL 15.271(4).\n27\n     MCL 15.273.\n28\n     Leemreis v Sherman Twp, 273 Mich App 691, 701; 731 NW2d 787 (2007).\n29\n  South Haven v Van Buren Co Bd of Comm’rs, 478 Mich 518, 528-529; 734 NW2d 533\n(2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n30\n     Id. at 529 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f       Plaintiff does not seek to invalidate any action by defendants or make a claim for\n\npersonal liability against a public official. Therefore, we must train our focus on § 11 of\n\nthe OMA to determine if it provides an adequate basis for the Court of Appeals’ award of\n\ncourt costs and actual attorney fees in this case.31 MCL 15.271 provides as follows:\n\n              (1) If a public body is not complying with this act, the attorney\n       general, prosecuting attorney of the county in which the public body serves,\n       or a person may commence a civil action to compel compliance or to enjoin\n       further noncompliance with this act.\n\n              (2) An action for injunctive relief against a local public body shall be\n       commenced in the circuit court, and venue is proper in any county in which\n       the public body serves. An action for an injunction against a state public\n       body shall be commenced in the circuit court and venue is proper in any\n       county in which the public body has its principal office, or in Ingham\n       county. If a person commences an action for injunctive relief, that person\n       shall not be required to post security as a condition for obtaining a\n       preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order.\n\n              (3) An action for mandamus against a public body under this act\n       shall be commenced in the court of appeals.\n\n            (4) If a public body is not complying with this act, and a person\n       commences a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to\n       compel compliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with the act and\n\n\n\n31\n   The Court of Appeals failed to identify the source of its authority to grant plaintiff\ndeclaratory relief in this case. The OMA does not provide for such relief. Nor is it clear\nthat plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief under MCR 2.605, the court rule governing\ndeclaratory judgments. See South Haven, 478 Mich at 533-534 (stating that a party does\nnot have standing to bring a declaratory judgment claim where there is no actual\ncontroversy); id. at 528 (“It is well settled that when a statute provides a remedy, a court\nshould enforce the legislative remedy rather than one the court prefers.”) (quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). In any event, since no party raised the issue, we will assume\nwithout deciding that plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief on its claim that\ndefendants violated the act by not timely posting the Planning Commission’s modified\nmeeting schedule, as required by MCL 15.265(3).\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f           succeeds in obtaining relief in the action, the person shall recover court\n           costs and actual attorney fees for the action.\n\n           At the outset, we acknowledge that, in isolation, the phrase “relief in the action” in\n\nMCL 15.271(4) could potentially refer to more than one type of relief because “it is well\n\nestablished that ‘we may not read into the statute what is not within the Legislature’s\n\nintent as derived from the language of a statute.’ ”32           However, “it is equally well\n\nestablished that to discern the Legislature’s intent, statutory provisions are not to be read\n\nin isolation; rather, context matters, and thus statutory provisions are to be read as a\n\nwhole.”33 An attempt to segregate any portion or exclude any portion of a statute from\n\nconsideration is almost certain to distort legislative intent.34          Therefore, plaintiff’s\n\nstrained reading of an excerpt of one sentence must yield to context. If, when reading the\n\nstatute as a whole, it is apparent that “relief in the action” refers to injunctive relief, we\n\nshould not circumscribe our analysis to one clause of the sentence.\n\n           Looking to the plain language of MCL 15.271(4), we believe it is clear that the\n\nLegislature only intended for a person to recover court costs and actual attorney fees if\n\nthe person succeeds in obtaining injunctive relief.35 The first statutory condition, “[i]f a\n\n32\n     Robinson v City of Lansing, 486 Mich 1, 15; 782 NW2d 171 (2010) (citation omitted).\n33\n     Id.\n34\n  Id. at 16, citing 2A Singer & Singer, Statutes & Statutory Construction (7th ed), § 47.2,\np 282.\n35\n   As noted above, Subsection (4) provides for an award of court costs and actual attorney\nfees when three conditions are met: (1) “a public body is not complying with the act”;\n(2) a person files “a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\ncompliance or enjoin further noncompliance with the act”; and (3) the person “succeeds\nin obtaining relief in the action.” MCL 15.271(4).\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fpublic body is not complying with this act,” contemplates an ongoing violation, precisely\n\nthe circumstances in which injunctive relief is appropriate. The second condition, i.e.,\n\ncommencement of “a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\n\ncompliance or enjoin further noncompliance with the act,” directly refers to and\n\nobviously requires that a party seek injunctive relief. And the third condition, i.e., a\n\nrequirement that a party who files an action seeking such relief “succeeds in obtaining\n\nrelief in the action,” cannot be divorced from the phrases that precede it.36\n\n         Plaintiff makes much of the fact that, in this latter phrase, the Legislature did not\n\nspecifically modify the word “relief” with the word “injunctive,” and argues that this\n\nmeans that any relief obtained for a violation of the OMA mandates an award of attorney\n\nfees and costs. However, by its plain language, MCL 15.271(4) requires that the plaintiff\n\nsucceed “in obtaining relief in the action.” We find it significant that the phrase “relief in\n\nthe action” employs the definite article, “the.”37 Use of that word, which we read as\n\nhaving a “specifying or particularizing effect,”38 indicates a legislative intent to refer to\n\nan action seeking injunctive relief and subsequently obtaining such relief. That is, given\n\nthat the relevant phrase, “relief in the action,” immediately follows the phrase “a person\n\ncommences a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief,” the phrase “relief\n\n\n36\n   See Sanchick v State Bd of Optometry, 342 Mich 555, 559; 70 NW2d 757 (1955)\n(“[W]ords and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which\nfollow.”).\n37\n   See Robinson, 486 Mich at 14, citing Detroit v Tygard, 381 Mich 271, 275; 161 NW2d\n1 (1968) (“We regard the use of the definite article ‘the’ as significant.”).\n38\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (2001).\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fin the action” must also be construed as referring to injunctive relief. Obtaining relief\n\nother than injunctive relief merely because, or as result, of the action is insufficient to\n\nmeet the requirement of the statute.39\n\n         Moreover, even though the Legislature did not modify the word “relief” with the\n\nword “injunctive” in the particular phrase at issue, use of the word “injunctive” when\n\nagain referring to “relief” was unnecessary.       This Court was faced with an almost\n\nidentical problem in Robinson v City of Lansing: the Legislature modified a noun, but\n\nomitted the modifier from its subsequent use of the noun.40 The defendant City argued\n\nthat the Legislature’s failure to qualify “highway” as a “county highway” in\n\nMCL 691.1402a(2) meant that the 2-inch rule applied to all improved portions of\n\nhighways designed for vehicular travel.41 Plaintiff, on the other hand, asserted that the\n\n39\n  See Felice v Cheboygan Co Zoning Comm, 103 Mich App 742, 746; 304 NW2d 1\n(1981) (“Some meaning must be attributed to the phrase ‘relief in the action.’ The\nLegislature did not use the phrase ‘because of the action,’ nor did they simply require that\na party be successful in obtaining ‘relief.’ In choosing the words ‘in the action,’ the\nLegislature intended to restrict the circumstances under which a plaintiff would be\nentitled to costs and actual attorney fees.”).\n40\n     Robinson, 486 Mich at 10-11, citing MCL 691.1402a.\n41\n   Robinson, 486 Mich at 13. The version of MCL 691.1402a in effect at the time\nprovided, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n                 (1) Except as otherwise provided by this section, a municipal\n         corporation has no duty to repair or maintain, and is not liable for injuries\n         arising from, a portion of a county highway outside of the improved portion\n         of the highway designed for vehicular travel, including a sidewalk, trailway,\n         crosswalk, or other installation. This subsection does not prevent or limit a\n         municipal corporation’s liability if both of the following are true:\n\n                (a) At least 30 days before the occurrence of the relevant injury,\n         death, or damage, the municipal corporation knew or, in the exercise of\n\n\n                                              14\n\f“highway” in Subsection (2) must be a “county highway” as framed by Subsection (1)\n\n(meaning it did not apply to the state highway where she was injured).42 This Court sided\n\nwith the plaintiff, stating that “a reasonable person reading this statute would understand\n\nthat all three subsections of this provision apply only to county highways.”43\n\n         The same analysis applies here. Subsection (4) specifically refers to and is limited\n\nto injunctive relief by use of the word “injunctive” in the preceding phrase, “a civil action\n\nagainst the public body for injunctive relief[.]” Because the word “relief” appears twice\n\nin the same sentence, only a strained reading of a portion of that sentence prevents the\n\nobvious conclusion that the second mention of “relief” is in direct reference to the first.\n\nThe Legislature was not required to restate the modifier, “injunctive,” when again\n\nreferring to the noun, “relief,” as the modifier was already sufficiently incorporated into\n\nthe statute and, when read in context, was implied when the Legislature subsequently\n\n\n         reasonable diligence, should have known of the existence of a defect in a\n         sidewalk, trailway, crosswalk, or other installation outside of the improved\n         portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\n\n                 (b) The defect described in subdivision (a) is a proximate cause of\n         the injury, death, or damage.\n\n                (2) A discontinuity defect of less than 2 inches creates a rebuttable\n         inference that the municipal corporation maintained the sidewalk, trailway,\n         crosswalk, or other installation outside of the improved portion of the\n         highway designed for vehicular travel in reasonable repair [i.e., the “2-inch\n         rule”]. [Emphasis added.]\n42\n     Robinson, 486 Mich at 13.\n43\n   Id. at 16; see also McCahan v Brennan, 492 Mich 730, 739; 822 NW2d 747 (2012)\n(“When undertaking statutory interpretation, the provisions of a statute should be read\nreasonably and in context.”).\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fused the word “relief.”44 A reasonable reader of MCL 15.271(4) would understand that\n\nwhen a plaintiff “commences a civil action . . . for injunctive relief,” the plaintiff is\n\nrequired to “succeed[] in obtaining [injunctive] relief in the action” to be entitled to court\n\ncosts and actual attorney fees.\n\n         Our conclusion is reinforced by viewing MCL 15.271 as a whole. The statute\n\nallows a person to seek injunctive relief to compel compliance or to enjoin further\n\nnoncompliance with the OMA.45 The statute then provides the proper venue in which to\n\ncommence an action for injunctive relief.46 And finally, the statute allows for a person to\n\nrecover court costs and actual attorney fees for an action against the public body for\n\ninjunctive relief if a person “succeeds in obtaining relief in the action.”47 Thus, as a\n\nwhole, MCL 15.271 only speaks in terms of an injunctive relief and contemplates no\n\nother form of relief.48\n\n\n44\n   See Robinson, 486 Mich at 16-17 (“[W]e do not believe that the Legislature is under an\nobligation to cumbersomely repeat language that is sufficiently incorporated into a\nstatute . . . .”); Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 472 Mich 521, 533; 697 NW2d\n895 (2005) (“ ‘[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.’ ”)\n(citation omitted).\n45\n     MCL 15.271(1) and (4).\n46\n     MCL 15.271(2).\n47\n     MCL 15.271(4).\n48\n   We note that MCL 15.271(3) discusses an “action for mandamus” instead of an “action\nfor injunctive relief” like MCL 15.271(1), (2), and (4). However, mandamus operates\nlike an injunction, as mandamus “may issue to compel a body or an officer to perform a\nclear legal duty for one holding a clear legal right to such performance.” Detroit v\nDetroit Police Officers Ass’n, 174 Mich App 388, 392; 435 NW2d 799 (1989) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f         Plaintiff’s interpretation of the statute does not comport with the statutory scheme.\n\nAccording to plaintiff’s theory, a party can satisfy the second condition of the statute\n\nsimply by requesting injunctive relief—regardless of whether such claim has any legal\n\nmerit. And, according to plaintiff, as long as a party receives any type of relief, the party\n\nhas satisfied the third condition of the statute—regardless of whether the relief arises\n\nfrom another section of the OMA or has a separate legal basis altogether. We cannot\n\nconclude that this is what the Legislature intended simply by omitting an implied\n\nmodifier. Rather, a party seeking a remedy under the OMA is confined to the remedy\n\nprovided under the applicable section of the act—here, MCL 15.271.49 A party cannot\n\nsimply assert a meritless claim for injunctive relief under MCL 15.271 in the hope that\n\none of its other claims will yield some fruit, and then bootstrap its claim for court costs\n\nand actual attorney fees on the other relief provided.\n\n         In sum, when considering both the plain meaning of the critical phrase in context\n\nas well as its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme, MCL 15.271 limits the\n\naward of attorney fees to cases in which the public body persists in violating the act, a\n\nsuit is brought to enjoin such behavior, and that suit is successful in obtaining injunctive\n\nrelief. Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase “succeeds in obtaining relief in the\n\naction” necessarily mandates that the plaintiff succeed in obtaining injunctive relief, not\n\njust any relief, in order to be entitled to court costs and actual attorney fees under\n\nMCL 15.271(4).\n\n\n\n49\n     See South Haven, 478 Mich at 529.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f         In so holding, we acknowledge the line of contrary holdings of the Court of\n\nAppeals. But, for the reasons explained above, the Ridenour court and the cases that\n\nfollowed it impermissibly strayed from the plain language of MCL 15.271(4).50 There is\n\nno allowance in the statute for obtaining the equivalent of relief—rather the plaintiff must\n\nobtain injunctive relief, as sought in commencing the action.51 The Court of Appeals has\n\nunfortunately perpetuated this error in numerous cases since Ridenour.52 Because these\n\ndecisions have incorrectly extended the entitlement to court costs and actual attorney fees\n\nbeyond the scope articulated by the Legislature, we overrule Ridenour and its progeny to\n\nthe extent that those cases allow for the recovery of attorney fees and costs under\n\nMCL 15.271(4) when injunctive relief was not obtained, equivalent or otherwise.\n\n                                        IV. APPLICATION\n\n         Plaintiff commenced a civil action against the Board and Planning Commission\n\nthat sought to enjoin the Planning Commission and the Board from further\n\nnoncompliance with the OMA under MCL 15.271.

See McCahan v Brennan, 492 Mich 730,\n749-750; 822 NW2d 747 (2012) (“[S]ound principles of statutory construction require\nthat Michigan courts determine the Legislature’s intent from its words, not from its\nsilence.”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n51\n   To the extent the dissent invokes the federal presumption that a declaratory judgment is\nthe functional equivalent of an injunction, that presumption has not been adopted in this\nstate, nor would it apply in this context given that the Legislature has explicitly provided\ninjunctive relief as an available remedy under the OMA.

As the Court of Appeals explained in its January 2013 opinion,\n\n“there was no evidence that the Commission had a history of OMA violations,[53] there\n\nwas no evidence that this violation was done willfully,” and there was no evidence that\n\nthe public or plaintiff was harmed in any manner.54 Although the Court of Appeals\n\nconcluded that plaintiff was nevertheless entitled to declaratory relief for defendants’\n\nnotice violation, he is not entitled to receive court costs and actual attorney fees because\n\nhe did not succeed in obtaining injunctive relief in the action, as MCL 15.271(4) requires.\n\n                                   V. CONCLUSION\n\n       We hold that a person cannot recover court costs and actual attorney fees under\n\nMCL 15.271(4) unless he or she succeeds in obtaining injunctive relief in the action.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals opinion and order issued December 19,\n\n2013, and reinstate the portion of the Court of Appeals decision issued January 22, 2013,\n\nregarding court costs and actual attorney fees.\n                                                        David F.

(dissenting).\n       Shortly after the enactment of the Open Meetings Act (OMA), MCL 15.261 et\n\nseq., the Court of Appeals effectively held that declaratory relief granted in lieu of or as\n\nthe functional equivalent of an injunction supports an award of costs and actual attorney\n\nfees under MCL 15.271(4). See Ridenour v Dearborn Bd of Ed, 111 Mich App 798; 314\n\nNW2d 760 (1981). Over the past 33 years, the Court of Appeals has reiterated that\n\nholding in numerous published opinions, solidifying the role of declaratory relief as it\n\nrelates to costs and attorney fees under MCL 15.271(4).         Despite this long line of\n\nprecedent, at no time has the Legislature taken steps to amend MCL 15.271(4) in\n\nresponse. Because I believe that these cases properly interpreted and effectuated the\n\nLegislature’s intent, I respectfully dissent.\n\n       In 1968, the Legislature enacted an open meetings law to consolidate a\n\n“patchwork of statutes” that required accountability and openness in governmental\n\faffairs. Booth v Univ of Mich Bd of Regents, 444 Mich 211, 221; 507 NW 2d 422 (1993).\n\nBy rendering the decision-making process of most public bodies open and accessible to\n\nthe public, the 1968 statute was intended to act as “ ‘an important check and balance on\n\nself-government.’ ”   Id. at 223, quoting Osmon, Sunshine or Shadows: One State’s\n\nDecision, 1977 Det C L Rev 613, 617.          Specifically, by addressing a longstanding\n\nconcern regarding the public’s access to governmental decision-making,1 the statute’s\n\naim was to “ ‘serve as both a light and disinfectant in exposing potential abuse and\n\nmisuse of power.’ ” Booth, 444 Mich at 223, quoting Sunshine or Shadows, 1977 Det C\n\nL Rev at 617. Although the goals of the 1968 statute were laudable, the statute was\n\nflawed: “because the 1968 statute failed to impose an enforcement mechanism and\n\npenalties to deter noncompliance, nothing prevented the wholesale evasion of the act’s\n\nprovisions” by public bodies, and the law was often ignored. Booth, 444 Mich at 221.\n\nSee, also, Sunshine or Shadows, 1977 Det C L Rev at 619. To remedy this, the statute\n\nwas “comprehensively revise[d]” in 1976 to provide for enforcement by way of several\n\nmechanisms, including actions by private citizens to vindicate, not primarily personal\n\nrights, but the rights of the public at large.     Booth, 444 Mich at 222.       One such\n\nenforcement provision is MCL 15.271(4), which provides that a successful party is\n\nentitled to court costs and actual attorney fees. Specifically, MCL 15.271(4) states:\n\n       If a public body is not complying with this act, and a person commences a\n       civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\n       compliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with the act and succeeds in\n1\n See Sunshine or Shadows, 1977 Det C L Rev at 617 (“Concern for public access to\ngovernmental decision-making is not new. . . . [T]he importance of government being\nopen and accessible was established very early in this country.”).\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       obtaining relief in the action, the person shall recover court costs and actual\n       attorney fees for the action.\n\n       At issue in this case is whether the statutory phrase “succeeds in obtaining relief in\n\nthe action” encompasses more than formal injunctive relief. Stated another way, at issue\n\nis whether the Court of Appeals has correctly effectuated the Legislature’s intent by\n\nholding that the absence of formal injunctive relief does not preclude a plaintiff from\n\nrecovering statutory attorney fees and costs under MCL 15.271(4). Considering the\n\npurposes behind the OMA, including the Legislature’s conscious choice to enact a citizen\n\nenforcement provision aimed at ensuring compliance with the OMA, I cannot conclude\n\nthat the last 33 years of Court of Appeals precedent was in error.\n\n       As previously noted, four years after the effective date of MCL 15.271(4), the\n\nRidenour panel effectively held that declaratory relief granted in lieu of or as the\n\nfunctional equivalent of an injunction supports an award of costs and actual attorney fees\n\nunder the statute. In Ridenour, the plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendant from holding a\n\nclosed meeting.    Although the trial court determined that the defendant’s proposed\n\nconduct would violate the OMA, it determined that injunctive relief was not necessary in\n\nlight of the defendant’s promise that it would comply with the trial court’s decision.\n\nRidenour, 111 Mich App at 801. Despite the trial court’s decision to deny the plaintiff’s\n\nrequest for injunctive relief on that basis, it granted the plaintiff’s request for costs and\n\nattorney fees under MCL 15.271(4), reasoning that the relief that the plaintiff obtained\n\nwas “the equivalent of an injunction.” Id. at 801. On appeal, the Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the award of costs and attorney fees explaining, “No matter how it is viewed,\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fplaintiff received the relief he sought. The [trial court] agreed with plaintiff’s position\n\nand gave a judgment in his favor.” Id. at 806.\n\n       Subsequent panels of the Court of Appeals have followed Ridenour, reasoning\n\nthat, under MCL 15.271(4), “neither proof of injury nor issuance of an injunction is a\n\nprerequisite for the recovery of attorney fees under the OMA”; rather, under the language\n\nof MCL 15.271(4), a “plaintiff need only ‘succeed in obtaining relief in the action,’ ”\n\nand, therefore, declaratory relief, as a form of relief, is necessarily sufficient. Herald Co,\n\nInc v Tax Tribunal, 258 Mich App 78, 92; 669 NW2d 862 (2003), quoting\n\nMCL 15.271(4) (emphasis added).2 Accordingly, for more than three decades, the Court\n\n2\n  See, also, Menominee Co Taxpayers Alliance, Inc v Menominee Co Clerk, 139 Mich\nApp 814; 362 NW2d 871 (1984) (holding that the absence of a formal injunction does not\npreclude the plaintiff from recovering costs and attorney fees under MCL 15.271(4));\nSchmiedicke v Clare Sch Bd, 228 Mich App 259, 267; 577 NW2d 706 (1998) (holding\nthat the “legal remedy of declaratory relief is adequate” to trigger an award of attorney\nfees and costs under MCL 15.271(4)); Manning v East Tawas, 234 Mich App 244, 253-\n254; 593 NW2d 649 (1999) (expressly rejecting the notion that a failure to either grant\ninjunctive relief or order future compliance with the OMA precludes an award of costs\nand attorney fees, reasoning that a finding that the OMA was violated constitutes\ndeclaratory relief, which is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to an award of costs and\nattorney fees under MCL 15.271(4)); Nicholas v Meridian Charter Twp Bd, 239 Mich\nApp 525, 535; 609 NW2d 574 (2000) (holding that a declaratory judgment entitles a\nplaintiff to actual attorney fees and costs under MCL 15.271(4), “despite the fact that the\ntrial court found it unnecessary to grant an injunction given defendants’ decision to\namend the notice provision after plaintiffs filed the present suit”); Kitchen v Ferndale\nCity Council, 253 Mich App 115, 127-128; 654 NW2d 918 (2002) (“Costs and fees are\nmandatory under the OMA when the plaintiff obtains relief in an action brought under the\nAct” because “[t]he plain language of [MCL 15.271(4)] simply states that plaintiffs need\nonly ‘succeed[] in obtaining relief in the action’ in order to recover court costs and\nattorney fees”) (citation omitted); Morrison v East Lansing, 255 Mich App 505, 521 n 11;\n660 NW2d 395 (2003) (noting that the trial court properly granted the plaintiffs’ attorney\nfees and other costs because, “[w]here a trial court declares that the defendants violated\nthe OMA, but finds it unnecessary to grant injunctive relief, the plaintiffs are entitled to\nactual attorney fees and costs”); Craig v Detroit Pub Sch Chief Executive Officer, 265\n\n\n                                              4\n\fof Appeals has repeatedly held that declaratory relief granted in lieu of an injunction or\n\nthat is the functional equivalent of an injunction is sufficient to trigger an award of\n\nattorney fees and costs because, in such cases, the plaintiff has “succeeded in obtaining\n\nrelief in the action,” which is all that MCL 15.271(4) requires.\n\n       Despite the clear holdings of the Court of Appeals, the Legislature has not\n\namended MCL 15.271(4) or otherwise taken any action to signal its disapproval of\n\nRidenour and its progeny, even though the Legislature has made numerous amendments\n\nto other provisions of the OMA.        I continue to find relevant the well-established\n\npresumption that the Legislature is aware of statutory interpretations by this Court and\n\nthe Court of Appeals. See Ford Motor Co v City of Woodhaven, 475 Mich 425, 439-440;\n\n716 NW2d 247 (2006); Gordon Sel-Way, Inc v Spence Bros, Inc, 438 Mich 488, 505-506;\n\n475 NW2d 704 (1991).3 Consequently, in my view, the Legislature’s silence on this\n\ntopic since 1981 is a strong indication that the Court of Appeals has properly effectuated\n\nthe Legislature’s intent, in accordance with that primary goal of statutory interpretation.\n\nIn re MCI Telecom Complaint, 460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999); Craig v\n\nLarson, 432 Mich 346, 353; 439 NW2d 899 (1989). While the Legislature may not be\n\nrequired to “cumbersomely repeat language that is sufficiently incorporated into a\n\nstatute,” Robinson v Lansing, 486 Mich 1, 16-17; 782 NW2d 171 (2010), the Legislature\n\nMich App 572, 580; 697 NW2d 529 (2005) (stating that “[t]he imposition of attorney\nfees is mandatory upon a finding of a violation of the OMA”).\n3\n  See, also, Autio v Proksch Constr Co, 377 Mich 517, 546; 141 NW2d 81 (1966)\n(BLACK, J., dissenting) (noting the “constantly employed axiom” that “the legislature\nenacts with the Court’s interpretational decisions in one hand as it writes and votes with\nthe other”).\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\falso unquestionably has the ability to correct judicial interpretations that it believes are\n\ncontrary to its intent. The fact that the Legislature has long acquiesced to Ridenour and\n\nits progeny, despite numerous intervening amendments to the OMA, is, in my opinion,\n\ncompelling.4\n\n       Indeed, the interpretation of the statutory language in Ridenour and its progeny is\n\nconsistent with the purpose of MCL 15.271(4) and the history of the OMA, both of which\n\nare relevant considerations in discerning the Legislature’s intent.        In re Certified\n\nQuestion, 433 Mich 710, 722; 449 NW2d 660 (1989); Booth, 444 Mich at 223-224. To\n\nbegin, it is entirely reasonable to presume that public bodies will adhere to the law as\n\ndeclared by a court. Cf. Straus v Governor, 459 Mich 526, 532; 592 NW2d 53 (1999)\n\n(noting that declaratory relief is generally sufficient to induce the legislative and\n\nexecutive branches to comply with the law); Florida v US Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs, 780 F Supp 2d 1307, 1314, 1316 (ND Fla, 2011) (noting the longstanding\n\npresumption that federal officials will follow the law as declared by a court). In fact, a\n\njudgment for declaratory relief constitutes a binding and conclusive adjudication of the\n\nrights and status of the litigants. Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed). Thus, a declaratory\n\njudgment has the force and effect of a final judgment. MCR 2.605(E). It is a “real\n\njudgment, not just a bit of friendly advice,” and, as one court has noted, those who try to\n\n\n4\n While some members of this Court undoubtedly disagree with the doctrine of legislative\nacquiescence, I continue to believe that the doctrine, which has a deep-rooted history in\nMichigan, remains a valid interpretive aid. See McCahan v Brennan, 492 Mich 730,\n757 n 22; 822 NW2d 747 (2012) (MARILYN KELLY, J., dissenting); Karaczewski v\nFarbman Stein & Co, 478 Mich 28, 53-54; 732 NW2d 56 (2007) (MARILYN KELLY, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fevade it will likely “come to regret it.” US Dep’t of Health & Human Servs, 780 F Supp\n\n2d at 1316, quoting Badger Catholic, Inc v Walsh, 620 F3d 775, 782 (CA 7, 2010).5 “If it\n\nwere otherwise, a . . . declaratory judgment would serve no useful purpose as a final\n\ndetermination of rights.”    Id. (quotation marks omitted).     See, also, MCR 2.605(F)\n\n(“Further necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment may be\n\ngranted . . . .”). Consequently, in the context of public bodies, a judgment for declaratory\n\nrelief is the “functional equivalent of an injunction.” US Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs, 780 F Supp 2d at 1314 (citations and quotation marks omitted).6 As a final order,\n\na declaratory judgment acts to restrain public bodies from further noncompliance with the\n\nOMA, consistent with the overall purpose of MCL 15.271. Accordingly, as Ridenour\n\nexplained, although a plaintiff might not receive relief in the form of an injunction, the\n\nreceipt of a declaratory judgment upon the finding of an OMA violation is the functional\n\nequivalent of one. Ridenour, 111 Mich App at 806. Although that might not be the case\n\nin a context other than the OMA, considering the purpose of MCL 15.271 and the OMA\n\n\n5\n  Indeed, the evasion of a court’s judgment might trigger other enforcement provisions of\nthe OMA, further supporting the conclusion that declaratory relief, in the context of the\nOMA, acts to restrain noncompliance with the OMA. See MCL 15.272(1) (“A public\nofficial who intentionally violates this act is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine\nof not more than $1,000.00.”); MCL 15.273(1) (“A public official who intentionally\nviolates this act shall be personally liable in a civil action for actual and exemplary\ndamages of not more than $ 500.00 total, plus court costs and actual attorney fees to a\nperson or group of persons bringing the action.”).\n6\n See, also, id. at 1316 (referring to a declaratory judgment against governmental officials\nas a “de facto injunction”); California v Grace Brethren Church, 457 US 393, 408; 102 S\nCt 2498; 73 L Ed 2d 93 (1982) (“[T]here is little practical difference between injunctive\nand declaratory relief . . . .”).\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fgenerally, I believe that Ridenour and its progeny clearly effectuated the intent of the\n\nLegislature by concluding that obtaining a judgment for declaratory relief is\n\n“succeed[ing] in obtaining relief in the action.” See MCL 15.271(4).\n\n       In contrast to Ridenour and its progeny, the majority’s interpretation undermines\n\nthe OMA’s enforcement provision and the purpose of the OMA, generally. In addition to\n\nmandating formal injunctive relief before costs and attorney fees can be awarded, the\n\nmajority now clarifies that an “ongoing violation” is also a prerequisite to obtaining costs\n\nand attorney fees under the OMA. Consequently, the majority opinion effectively gives a\n\npublic body at least one free pass at violating the OMA because, without more, the public\n\nbody’s violation of the OMA, no matter how substantial, is presumably not “ongoing.”7 I\n\ndo not believe that the majority’s apparent interpretation is what the Legislature intended\n\nwhen it adopted legislation aimed at promoting a “new era” of governmental\n\n7\n  The majority does not elaborate on the meaning of “ongoing violation.” However, to\nthe extent that the majority opinion could be read to suggest that a plaintiff cannot bring\nsuit under MCL 15.271 if the OMA violation is already complete at the time suit is filed,\nthat result is inconsistent with decades of precedent. See Wexford Co Prosecutor v\nPranger, 83 Mich App 197, 204; 268 NW2d 344 (1978) (“Insofar as the declaratory\njudgment finds the closed session of May 9, 1977, in violation of the open meetings\nstatute, we affirm”); Nicholas, 239 Mich App at 535 (“Here, the trial court declared that\ndefendants violated the OMA. This constitutes declaratory relief, thus entitling plaintiffs\nto actual attorney fees and costs despite the fact that the trial court found it unnecessary to\ngrant an injunction given defendants’ decision to amend the notice provision after\nplaintiffs filed the present suit”). Such a conclusion would also preclude most OMA\nactions that are brought under MCL 15.271(4) to challenge the alleged erroneous\nprocedures used by a public body. Notably, those actions ultimately assist in bringing\nclarity to the OMA’s requirements, thereby reducing future violations and furthering the\nOMA’s purpose. I imagine that most citizens will not have time to run to the doors of a\ncourthouse the moment a public body makes an erroneous decision to conduct its meeting\nin secret or in violation of the OMA’s notice requirements. But, under the majority’s\napparent interpretation, this may now be required.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\faccountability and public access to governmental decision-making. Booth, 444 Mich at\n\n222-223.\n\n       Further, under the majority’s interpretation of MCL 15.271(4), even if a lawsuit\n\nmay be brought to enforce the interests of the public at large, there is no incentive for the\n\npublic body not to contest the plaintiff’s interpretation of the statutory provisions through\n\nvigorous litigation. After all, upon the trial court’s adverse ruling, the public body need\n\nonly concede defeat to preclude injunctive relief. See Wexford Co Prosecutor v Pranger,\n\n83 Mich App 197, 205; 268 NW2d 344 (1978) (affirming declaratory relief based on a\n\nviolation of the OMA, but vacating an injunction, reasoning that there was no “real and\n\nimminent danger of irreparable injury” when the defendants acted in good faith);\n\nNicholas v Meridian Charter Twp Bd, 239 Mich App 525, 534; 609 NW2d 574 (2000)\n\n(“Where there is no reason to believe that a public body will deliberately fail to comply\n\nwith the OMA in the future, injunctive relief is unwarranted.”). Under the majority’s\n\ninterpretation, such a concession will preclude an award to the plaintiff for his or her\n\ncosts of pursuing the litigation even though, as previously explained, a grant of\n\ndeclaratory relief is generally sufficient to make the violation known to the public body\n\nand restrain it from further violating the OMA, which is consistent with the purpose of\n\nMCL 15.271(4) and the purpose of the OMA generally.\n\n       Of particular importance is that, in enacting MCL 15.271(4), the Legislature\n\ngranted individual citizens the right to pursue remedies for OMA violations rather than\n\nrely solely on the Attorney General or county prosecutors. By doing so, the Legislature\n\nseems to have implicitly recognized that there would be times when members of the\n\nexecutive branch could not, or would not, act and that, in those instances, the overriding\n\n\n                                             9\n\fconcern for governmental accountability mandates the availability of causes of action\n\nbrought by private citizens. In light of the Legislature’s choice to allow private citizen\n\nsuits to pursue remedies for procedural OMA violations,8 which vindicate the rights of\n\nthe public at large, I cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to limit this right to the\n\nsmall portion of the population that is capable of pursuing such actions at their own\n\npersonal expense. See Nemeth v Abonmarche Dev, Inc, 457 Mich 16, 47; 576 NW2d 641\n\n(1998) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The result of the\n\nmajority’s decision is that the ability of private citizens to bring OMA complaints will, in\n\nall likelihood, be severely curtailed. To penalize private citizens and, consequently, the\n\npublic at large, simply because relief comes in the form of a declaratory judgment, rather\n\nthan injunctive relief, elevates form over substance when, as explained earlier, there is\n\nlittle practical difference between the two forms of relief in this context. Consequently, I\n\ndo not believe that the Legislature intended the majority’s interpretation of MCL\n\n15.271(4), which undermines the OMA’s purpose.\n\n       In this case, plaintiff requested both injunctive and declaratory relief and was\n\nultimately awarded the latter. Because declaratory relief is sufficient to trigger attorney\n\nfees and costs under MCL 15.271(4), I would hold that plaintiff is entitled to costs and\n\nattorney fees, consistent with Ridenour and its progeny.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Compare MCL 15.270 (permitting a private citizen to seek the invalidation of a public\nbody’s decision upon a violation of the OMA) with MCL 15.271 (generally permitting\nprivate citizens to seek compliance with the procedural requirements of the OMA, rather\nthan the invalidation of a public body’s decision).\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       In light of the language, history, and purpose of the act, I cannot agree with the\n\nmajority’s decision to cast aside 33 years of precedent and erroneously write into the\n\nOMA a requirement that the Legislature did not intend—i.e., that a party must obtain\n\nformal injunctive relief as a prerequisite to an award of costs and attorney fees under\n\nMCL 15.271(4). Because I believe that more than three decades of precedent properly\n\ninterpreted and effectuated the Legislature’s intent, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n                                                          Michael F.

Speicher brought an action against the Columbia Township Board of Trustees\n       and the Columbia Township Planning Commission in the Van Buren Circuit Court, seeking\n       declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis of defendants’ alleged violations of the Open\n       Meetings Act (OMA), MCL 15.261 et seq. The trial court, Paul E. Hamre, J., granted summary\n       disposition in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed. In an unpublished opinion issued January\n       22, 2013, the Court of Appeals, WILDER, P.J., and O’CONNELL and K. F. KELLY, JJ., affirmed the\n       trial court’s denial of injunctive relief but reversed its denial of declaratory relief and remanded\n       the case for further proceedings, specifying that because the technical nature of the OMA\n       violation did not warrant injunctive relief, plaintiff was not entitled to attorney fees or costs\n       under MCL 15.271(4). Plaintiff moved for reconsideration. On December 19, 2013, the Court\n       of Appeals granted the motion, vacating that part of the opinion that had addressed attorney fees.\n       On reconsideration, the Court of Appeals held that under binding caselaw interpreting the OMA,\n       plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees and costs because he had succeeded in obtaining relief.\n       The Court of Appeals added that absent that caselaw, the panel would have held that attorney\n       fees and costs are available under MCL 15.271(4) only to plaintiffs who request and obtain\n       injunctive relief. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

A person may not recover court costs or attorney fees under the plain language\n       of that statute unless he or she succeeds in obtaining injunctive relief, overruling Ridenour v\n       Dearborn Bd of Ed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1764407\"><a href=\"/opinion/1764407/ridenour-v-bd-of-educ-of-city-of-dearborn-sch-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981), and its progeny to the extent that those cases\n       allowed the recovery of attorney fees and costs under MCL 15.271(4) when injunctive relief was\n       not obtained.\n\n              1. If a public body is not complying with the OMA, and a person commences a civil\n       action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel compliance or to enjoin further\n\fnoncompliance with the act and succeeds in obtaining relief in the action, the person shall\nrecover court costs and actual attorney fees for the action. The first statutory condition—if a\npublic body is not complying with the act—contemplates an ongoing violation, precisely the\ncircumstances in which injunctive relief is appropriate. The second statutory condition—\ncommencement of a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\ncompliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with the act—requires that the person seek\ninjunctive relief. The third statutory condition—a requirement that a person who files an action\nseeking such relief succeeds in obtaining relief in the action—cannot be separated from the\nphrase that precedes it. Given that the phrase “relief in the action,” uses a definite article and\nimmediately follows the phrase “a person commences a civil action against the public body for\ninjunctive relief,” the phrase “relief in the action” must be construed as referring to injunctive\nrelief. The Legislature was not required to restate the modifier “injunctive” when again referring\nto the noun “relief” because the modifier is implied when the statute is read as a whole. When\nread in the context of the statutory scheme, MCL 15.271 limits the award of attorney fees to\ncases in which the public body persists in violating the act, a suit is brought to enjoin that\nbehavior, and that suit is successful in obtaining injunctive relief. There is no allowance in the\nstatute for obtaining the equivalent of relief; the plaintiff must obtain injunctive relief, as sought\nin commencing the action.\n\n        2. In this case, the trial court and the Court of Appeals agreed that plaintiff failed to show\nthat he was entitled to injunctive relief because there was no evidence that the commission had a\nhistory of OMA violations, there was no evidence that this violation was willful, and there was\nno evidence that the public or plaintiff was harmed. Therefore, while the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief for defendants’ notice violation, he was\nnot entitled to court costs and attorney fees because he did not succeed in obtaining injunctive\nrelief.\n\n        Court of Appeals opinion and order issued December 19, 2013, reversed; portion of the\nCourt of Appeals opinion issued January 22, 2013, concerning court costs and attorney fees\nreinstated.\n\n       Justice CAVANAGH, dissenting, would have held that plaintiff was entitled to costs and\nattorney fees. Shortly after the enactment of the OMA, the Court of Appeals effectively held that\ndeclaratory relief granted in lieu of or as the functional equivalent of an injunction supports an\naward of costs and attorney fees under MCL 15.271(4). The Court of Appeals has reiterated that\nholding in numerous published opinions over a period of more than 30 years. Despite the clear\nholdings of the Court of Appeals, the Legislature has not taken any action to signal its\ndisapproval of that line of cases. The Legislature’s silence is a strong indication that the Court of\nAppeals properly effectuated the Legislature’s intent. The Court of Appeals’ interpretation,\nmoreover, was consistent with the purpose of MCL 15.271(4) in particular and the OMA more\nbroadly. In the context of public bodies, a judgment for declaratory relief is the functional\nequivalent of an injunction in that it restrains the public body from further noncompliance with\nthe OMA. The majority’s interpretation, in contrast, undermines the OMA’s enforcement\nprovision and the purpose of the OMA generally, and will curtail the ability of private citizens to\nbring OMA complaints.\n\n                                     ©2014 State of Michigan\n\f                                                                           Michigan Supreme Court\n                                                                                 Lansing, Michigan\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n                                                     Chief Justice:          Justices:\n                                                     Robert P.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that prior\n\ndecisions of that court have strayed from the plain language of MCL 15.271(4).\n\nTherefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals opinion and order issued December 19, 2013,\n\nand reinstate the portion of its January 22, 2013 decision regarding court costs and actual\n\nattorney fees.\n\n                      I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        In early 2010, the Columbia Township Board of Trustees (the Board) adopted a\n\nresolution that fixed the regular monthly meetings of the Board and the Columbia\n\nTownship Planning Commission (the Planning Commission) for the year 2010-2011.\n\nHowever, during the regularly scheduled October 18, 2010 meeting, the Planning\n\nCommission adopted another resolution that it would conduct quarterly, rather than\n\nmonthly, meetings beginning January 2011. According to the Township Clerk, after the\n\nPlanning Commission adopted the new schedule, she contacted a local newspaper, the\n\nSouth Haven Tribune, and requested publication of the new meeting schedule. She stated\n\nthat she also posted a revised meeting schedule at the Township Hall entrance with the\n\nFebruary and March 2011 meetings whited out.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    MCR 7.215(J).\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f         Plaintiff is a property owner in the township. According to plaintiff, he had no\n\nnotice of the new quarterly meeting schedule, and he appeared for the meetings in\n\nFebruary and March 2011, seeking to raise a number of issues before the Planning\n\nCommission. Plaintiff claimed that the posted schedule did not reflect the change to\n\nquarterly meetings and no notices appeared in the South Haven Tribune prior to those\n\npreviously scheduled meetings.\n\n         Plaintiff sued defendants, alleging that the decision to change the schedule was not\n\nmade at an open meeting3 and that the February and March meetings were canceled\n\nwithout proper notice in violation of the OMA.4 Plaintiff alleged that, as a result of the\n\nmeetings not being held, his right to present certain concerns to the Planning Commission\n\nwas impaired.5 Plaintiff sought a declaration that the Planning Commission’s decision to\n\n\n\n3\n MCL 15.263(2) requires that “[a]ll decisions of a public body shall be made at a\nmeeting open to the public.”\n4\n MCL 15.265(3) requires that public notice of changes to regularly scheduled meetings\nbe “posted within 3 days after the meeting at which the change is made[.]”\n5\n    This allegation appears to refer to MCL 15.270(2), which provides as follows:\n\n                A decision made by a public body may be invalidated if the public\n         body has not complied with the requirements of section 3\n         [MCL 15.263](1), (2), and (3) in making the decision or if failure to give\n         notice in accordance with section 5 [MCL 15.265] has interfered with\n         substantial compliance with section 3(1), (2), and (3) and the court finds\n         that the noncompliance or failure has impaired the rights of the public\n         under this act.\n\nHowever, plaintiff has specifically disclaimed that he sought to invalidate defendants’\ndecision under that provision, stating that “[t]he damage had been done and invalidation\nunder MCL 15.270 was simply not available.”\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fcancel the regularly scheduled meetings was made in violation of the OMA, and he\n\nsought to enjoin the Planning Commission and the Board from further noncompliance\n\nwith the OMA.6 Plaintiff also cited MCL 15.271(4) and alleged that “if this Court grants\n\nrelief as a result of this complaint, [plaintiff] shall recover court costs and actual attorney\n\nfees for this action.”\n\n       Finding that defendants’ conduct was not actionable, the trial court denied\n\nplaintiff’s motion for summary disposition and granted summary disposition to\n\ndefendants. The trial court also denied plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration. The trial\n\ncourt ruled that defendants did not violate the OMA because plaintiff was not denied\n\naccess to any meetings. To the extent that notice may not have been timely posted, this\n\nwas a technical violation not entitling plaintiff to relief. The trial court acknowledged\n\nthat the notice cancelling the February and March Planning Commission meetings “may\n\nnot have been done in strict compliance with” the OMA, but the court concluded that any\n\nviolations were “technical in nature, and did not impair the rights of the public in having\n\ntheir governmental bodies make decisions in an open meeting.” Plaintiff had, at most,\n\nbeen inconvenienced by the failure to post timely notice of the meeting changes given\n\nthat “[p]laintiff had the option of bringing his concerns to the Planning Commission at its\n\nnext regularly scheduled meeting.”\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Plaintiff clarified in a later pleading that his claim for injunctive relief was premised on\nthe Board’s prior violation of the OMA during the selection of a new township fire chief.\nSee Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, unpublished opinion per curiam of the\nCourt of Appeals, issued February 25, 2014 (Docket No. 313158).\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f          Plaintiff appealed in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in part and reversed in\n\npart in an unpublished opinion.7 The Court of Appeals concluded that while the meeting\n\nschedule change was properly made at an open meeting, defendants plainly violated the\n\nOMA by not timely posting the modified schedule. It therefore held that the trial court\n\nerred by failing to grant declaratory relief to plaintiff on that point. However, the Court\n\nof Appeals also held that the trial court properly denied injunctive relief for defendants’\n\ntechnical notice violation because “there was no evidence that the Commission had a\n\nhistory of OMA violations, there was no evidence that this violation was done willfully,”\n\nand there was no evidence that the public or plaintiff was harmed in any manner.8 The\n\nCourt of Appeals therefore ruled that “given that the technical nature of this OMA\n\nviolation resulted in no injunctive relief being warranted, plaintiff is not entitled to any\n\nattorney fees or costs under MCL 15.271(4) on remand.”9\n\n          Plaintiff moved for reconsideration, arguing that because the Court of Appeals had\n\nheld that he was entitled to declaratory relief under the OMA, he was entitled to an award\n\nof court costs and actual attorney fees under MCL 15.271(4). The Court of Appeals\n\ngranted reconsideration and vacated the portion of its unpublished opinion regarding\n\nattorney fees.10 In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals then held that plaintiff was\n\n7\n Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court\nof Appeals, issued January 22, 2013 (Docket No. 306684).\n8\n  Id. at 2. The Court of Appeals pointed out that plaintiff was able to present his concerns\nto the Commission at the December 2010, January 2011, and April 2011 meetings.\n9\n    Id.\n10\n  Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals,\nentered December 19, 2013 (Docket No. 306684).\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fentitled to court costs and actual attorney fees under existing case law because he\n\nestablished entitlement to declaratory relief.11 However, the Court of Appeals reached\n\nthis conclusion only because it was bound by court rule to follow prior published Court\n\nof Appeals decisions.12 The Court explained that the rule that court costs and actual\n\nattorney fees were available whenever a plaintiff files a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief\n\nunder MCL 15.271 and obtains some form of relief had developed from the\n\nmisapplication of a prior Court of Appeals decision issued in 1981, Ridenour v Dearborn\n\nBd of Ed.13 However, the Court determined that this rule was unsupported by the plain\n\nlanguage of MCL 15.271(4) and that the cases that developed this rule often did not\n\nprovide any substantive analysis.14 Were the Court of Appeals free to decide the issue as\n\n11\n   Speicher v Columbia Twp Bd of Trustees, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

We note that the Court of Appeals also stated that “plaintiff did not request\nattorney fees at the trial court or in his claim of appeal.” Id. at 477. But our review of the\nrecord proves that statement to be inaccurate. Plaintiff initiated his request for attorney\nfees in his complaint and reiterated that request in briefing on his motion for summary\ndisposition and claim of appeal. Thus, this issue is preserved.\n12\n  Id. at 476-477, citing MCR 7.215(J)(1) (“A panel of the Court of Appeals must follow\nthe rule of law established by a prior published decision of the Court of Appeals issued\non or after November 1, 1990, that has not been reversed or modified by the Supreme\nCourt, or by a special panel of the Court of Appeals as provided in this rule.”).\n13\n   Speicher, 303 Mich App at 482, citing Ridenour v Dearborn Bd of Ed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1764407\"><a href=\"/opinion/1764407/ridenour-v-bd-of-educ-of-city-of-dearborn-sch-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Issues of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.17 In interpreting a statute,\n\nwe consider “both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as its\n\nplacement and purpose in the statutory scheme.”18 As with any statutory interpretation,\n\nour goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature by focusing on the statute’s plain\n\nlanguage.19\n\n                                       III. ANALYSIS\n\n         At issue in this case is the proper interpretation of the phrase “succeeds in\n\nobtaining relief in the action” in MCL 15.271(4). This Court has not yet addressed\n\nwhether that phrase refers to injunctive relief, as defendants contend and the Court of\n\nAppeals panel would have held, or to any relief, as plaintiff contends and the Ridenour\n\nline of cases have held.20 Unlike the Court of Appeals below, we are not bound by the\n\nprior Court of Appeals decisions. Therefore, we are able to independently assess the\n\nrelevant statutory language to determine whether the Court of Appeals has properly\n\ninterpreted MCL 15.271(4). For the reasons stated below, we agree with defendants and\n\n\n17\n  Eggleston v Bio-Medical Applications of Detroit, Inc, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848829\"><a href=\"/opinion/848829/eggleston-v-bio-medical-applications-of-detroit-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32; 658 NW2d 139\n(2003).\n18\n  Estate of Shinholster v Annapolis Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549; 685 NW2d 275 (2004)\n(quotation marks and citations omitted).\n19\n     Malpass v Dep’t of Treasury, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247-248; 833 NW2d 272 (2013).\n20\n   In Omdahl v West Iron Co Bd of Ed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"842422\"><a href=\"/opinion/842422/omdahl-v-west-iron-county-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 733 NW2d 380 (2007), this Court\naddressed the language of MCL 15.271(4), but the plaintiff there sought and obtained\ninjunctive relief, and the issue was limited to whether a pro se litigant, who is also an\nattorney, may recover court costs and actual attorney fees.\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fthe Court of Appeals panel that court costs and actual attorney fees under MCL 15.271\n\nmay only be awarded when a plaintiff seeks and obtains injunctive relief.\n\n        Under the OMA, public bodies must conduct their meetings, make all of their\n\ndecisions, and conduct their deliberations (when a quorum is present) at meetings open to\n\nthe public.21    The OMA also requires public bodies to give notice of their regular\n\nmeetings and changes in their meeting schedule in the manner prescribed by the act.22 If\n\na public body has failed to comply with the requirements of the act, in addition to\n\nauthorizing enforcement actions by the attorney general or local prosecuting attorney, the\n\nOMA also allows for any person to commence a civil action.23 The OMA creates a three-\n\ntiered enforcement scheme for private litigants:\n\n        (1)     Section 10 of the OMA allows a person to file a civil suit “to challenge the\n\nvalidity of a decision of a public body made in violation of this act.”24 Subsection (2)\n\nspecifies when a decision may be invalidated, and Subsection (5) allows a public body to\n\ncure the alleged defect by reenacting a disputed decision in conformity with the OMA.\n\nNotably, § 10 does not provide for an award of attorney fees or costs.\n\n        (2)     If a public body is not complying with the OMA, § 11 allows a person to\n\nfile a civil suit “to compel compliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with this act.”25\n\n21\n     MCL 15.263.\n22\n     MCL 15.265.\n23\n     MCL 15.270; MCL 15.271; MCL 15.273.\n24\n     MCL 15.270(1).\n25\n     MCL 15.271(1).\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fSubsection (4) provides for an award of court costs and actual attorney fees when three\n\nconditions are met: (a) a public body is not complying with the act; (b) a person files “a\n\ncivil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel compliance or enjoin\n\nfurther noncompliance with the act”; and (c) the person “succeeds in obtaining relief in\n\nthe action[.]”26 The meaning of this latter phrase is the crux of this case.\n\n         (3)    Finally, § 13 provides that a public official who intentionally violates the\n\nOMA is “personally liable in a civil action for actual or exemplary damages of not more\n\nthan $500.00 total, plus court costs and actual attorney fees . . . .”27\n\n         As an initial matter, “these sections, and the distinct kinds of relief that they\n\nprovide, stand alone.”28 This is an important point because “[t]o determine whether a\n\nplaintiff may bring a cause of action for a specific remedy, this Court must determine\n\nwhether [the Legislature] intended to create such a cause of action.”29 When a statute,\n\nlike the OMA, “gives new rights and prescribes new remedies, such remedies must be\n\nstrictly pursued; and a party seeking a remedy under the act is confined to the remedy\n\nconferred thereby and to that only.”30\n\n\n\n\n26\n     MCL 15.271(4).\n27\n     MCL 15.273.\n28\n     Leemreis v Sherman Twp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Therefore, we must train our focus on § 11 of\n\nthe OMA to determine if it provides an adequate basis for the Court of Appeals’ award of\n\ncourt costs and actual attorney fees in this case.31 MCL 15.271 provides as follows:\n\n              (1) If a public body is not complying with this act, the attorney\n       general, prosecuting attorney of the county in which the public body serves,\n       or a person may commence a civil action to compel compliance or to enjoin\n       further noncompliance with this act.\n\n              (2) An action for injunctive relief against a local public body shall be\n       commenced in the circuit court, and venue is proper in any county in which\n       the public body serves. An action for an injunction against a state public\n       body shall be commenced in the circuit court and venue is proper in any\n       county in which the public body has its principal office, or in Ingham\n       county. If a person commences an action for injunctive relief, that person\n       shall not be required to post security as a condition for obtaining a\n       preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order.\n\n              (3) An action for mandamus against a public body under this act\n       shall be commenced in the court of appeals.\n\n            (4) If a public body is not complying with this act, and a person\n       commences a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to\n       compel compliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with the act and\n\n\n\n31\n   The Court of Appeals failed to identify the source of its authority to grant plaintiff\ndeclaratory relief in this case. The OMA does not provide for such relief. Nor is it clear\nthat plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief under MCR 2.605, the court rule governing\ndeclaratory judgments. See South Haven, 478 Mich at 533-534 (stating that a party does\nnot have standing to bring a declaratory judgment claim where there is no actual\ncontroversy); id. at 528 (“It is well settled that when a statute provides a remedy, a court\nshould enforce the legislative remedy rather than one the court prefers.”) (quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). In any event, since no party raised the issue, we will assume\nwithout deciding that plaintiff was entitled to declaratory relief on its claim that\ndefendants violated the act by not timely posting the Planning Commission’s modified\nmeeting schedule, as required by MCL 15.265(3).\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f           succeeds in obtaining relief in the action, the person shall recover court\n           costs and actual attorney fees for the action.\n\n           At the outset, we acknowledge that, in isolation, the phrase “relief in the action” in\n\nMCL 15.271(4) could potentially refer to more than one type of relief because “it is well\n\nestablished that ‘we may not read into the statute what is not within the Legislature’s\n\nintent as derived from the language of a statute.’ ”32           However, “it is equally well\n\nestablished that to discern the Legislature’s intent, statutory provisions are not to be read\n\nin isolation; rather, context matters, and thus statutory provisions are to be read as a\n\nwhole.”33 An attempt to segregate any portion or exclude any portion of a statute from\n\nconsideration is almost certain to distort legislative intent.34          Therefore, plaintiff’s\n\nstrained reading of an excerpt of one sentence must yield to context. If, when reading the\n\nstatute as a whole, it is apparent that “relief in the action” refers to injunctive relief, we\n\nshould not circumscribe our analysis to one clause of the sentence.\n\n           Looking to the plain language of MCL 15.271(4), we believe it is clear that the\n\nLegislature only intended for a person to recover court costs and actual attorney fees if\n\nthe person succeeds in obtaining injunctive relief.35 The first statutory condition, “[i]f a\n\n32\n     Robinson v City of Lansing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"831621\"><a href=\"/opinion/831621/robinson-v-city-of-lansing/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15; 782 NW2d 171 (2010) (citation omitted).\n33\n     Id.\n34\n  Id. at 16, citing 2A Singer & Singer, Statutes & Statutory Construction (7th ed), § 47.2,\np 282.\n35\n   As noted above, Subsection (4) provides for an award of court costs and actual attorney\nfees when three conditions are met: (1) “a public body is not complying with the act”;\n(2) a person files “a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\ncompliance or enjoin further noncompliance with the act”; and (3) the person “succeeds\nin obtaining relief in the action.” MCL 15.271(4).\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fpublic body is not complying with this act,” contemplates an ongoing violation, precisely\n\nthe circumstances in which injunctive relief is appropriate. The second condition, i.e.,\n\ncommencement of “a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\n\ncompliance or enjoin further noncompliance with the act,” directly refers to and\n\nobviously requires that a party seek injunctive relief. And the third condition, i.e., a\n\nrequirement that a party who files an action seeking such relief “succeeds in obtaining\n\nrelief in the action,” cannot be divorced from the phrases that precede it.36\n\n         Plaintiff makes much of the fact that, in this latter phrase, the Legislature did not\n\nspecifically modify the word “relief” with the word “injunctive,” and argues that this\n\nmeans that any relief obtained for a violation of the OMA mandates an award of attorney\n\nfees and costs. However, by its plain language, MCL 15.271(4) requires that the plaintiff\n\nsucceed “in obtaining relief in the action.” We find it significant that the phrase “relief in\n\nthe action” employs the definite article, “the.”37 Use of that word, which we read as\n\nhaving a “specifying or particularizing effect,”38 indicates a legislative intent to refer to\n\nan action seeking injunctive relief and subsequently obtaining such relief. That is, given\n\nthat the relevant phrase, “relief in the action,” immediately follows the phrase “a person\n\ncommences a civil action against the public body for injunctive relief,” the phrase “relief\n\n\n36\n   See Sanchick v State Bd of Optometry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1916437\"><a href=\"/opinion/1916437/sanchick-v-state-bd-of-optometry/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559; 70 NW2d 757 (1955)\n(“[W]ords and clauses will not be divorced from those which precede and those which\nfollow.”).\n37\n   See Robinson, 486 Mich at 14, citing Detroit v Tygard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1280643\"><a href=\"/opinion/1280643/city-of-detroit-v-tygard/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275; 161 NW2d\n1 (1968) (“We regard the use of the definite article ‘the’ as significant.”).\n38\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (2001).\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fin the action” must also be construed as referring to injunctive relief.

This Court was faced with an almost\n\nidentical problem in Robinson v City of Lansing: the Legislature modified a noun, but\n\nomitted the modifier from its subsequent use of the noun.40 The defendant City argued\n\nthat the Legislature’s failure to qualify “highway” as a “county highway” in\n\nMCL 691.1402a(2) meant that the 2-inch rule applied to all improved portions of\n\nhighways designed for vehicular travel.41 Plaintiff, on the other hand, asserted that the\n\n39\n  See Felice v Cheboygan Co Zoning Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062823\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062823/felice-v-cheboygan-cty-zoning-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

The version of MCL 691.1402a in effect at the time\nprovided, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n                 (1) Except as otherwise provided by this section, a municipal\n         corporation has no duty to repair or maintain, and is not liable for injuries\n         arising from, a portion of a county highway outside of the improved portion\n         of the highway designed for vehicular travel, including a sidewalk, trailway,\n         crosswalk, or other installation. This subsection does not prevent or limit a\n         municipal corporation’s liability if both of the following are true:\n\n                (a) At least 30 days before the occurrence of the relevant injury,\n         death, or damage, the municipal corporation knew or, in the exercise of\n\n\n                                              14\n\f“highway” in Subsection (2) must be a “county highway” as framed by Subsection (1)\n\n(meaning it did not apply to the state highway where she was injured).42 This Court sided\n\nwith the plaintiff, stating that “a reasonable person reading this statute would understand\n\nthat all three subsections of this provision apply only to county highways.”43\n\n         The same analysis applies here. Subsection (4) specifically refers to and is limited\n\nto injunctive relief by use of the word “injunctive” in the preceding phrase, “a civil action\n\nagainst the public body for injunctive relief[.]” Because the word “relief” appears twice\n\nin the same sentence, only a strained reading of a portion of that sentence prevents the\n\nobvious conclusion that the second mention of “relief” is in direct reference to the first.\n\nThe Legislature was not required to restate the modifier, “injunctive,” when again\n\nreferring to the noun, “relief,” as the modifier was already sufficiently incorporated into\n\nthe statute and, when read in context, was implied when the Legislature subsequently\n\n\n         reasonable diligence, should have known of the existence of a defect in a\n         sidewalk, trailway, crosswalk, or other installation outside of the improved\n         portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\n\n                 (b) The defect described in subdivision (a) is a proximate cause of\n         the injury, death, or damage.\n\n                (2) A discontinuity defect of less than 2 inches creates a rebuttable\n         inference that the municipal corporation maintained the sidewalk, trailway,\n         crosswalk, or other installation outside of the improved portion of the\n         highway designed for vehicular travel in reasonable repair [i.e., the “2-inch\n         rule”].

The statute\n\nallows a person to seek injunctive relief to compel compliance or to enjoin further\n\nnoncompliance with the OMA.45 The statute then provides the proper venue in which to\n\ncommence an action for injunctive relief.46 And finally, the statute allows for a person to\n\nrecover court costs and actual attorney fees for an action against the public body for\n\ninjunctive relief if a person “succeeds in obtaining relief in the action.”47 Thus, as a\n\nwhole, MCL 15.271 only speaks in terms of an injunctive relief and contemplates no\n\nother form of relief.48\n\n\n44\n   See Robinson, 486 Mich at 16-17 (“[W]e do not believe that the Legislature is under an\nobligation to cumbersomely repeat language that is sufficiently incorporated into a\nstatute . . . .”); Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848642\"><a href=\"/opinion/848642/griffith-v-state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533; 697 NW2d\n895 (2005) (“ ‘[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.’ ”)\n(citation omitted).\n45\n     MCL 15.271(1) and (4).\n46\n     MCL 15.271(2).\n47\n     MCL 15.271(4).\n48\n   We note that MCL 15.271(3) discusses an “action for mandamus” instead of an “action\nfor injunctive relief” like MCL 15.271(1), (2), and (4).

And, according to plaintiff, as long as a party receives any type of relief, the party\n\nhas satisfied the third condition of the statute—regardless of whether the relief arises\n\nfrom another section of the OMA or has a separate legal basis altogether. We cannot\n\nconclude that this is what the Legislature intended simply by omitting an implied\n\nmodifier. Rather, a party seeking a remedy under the OMA is confined to the remedy\n\nprovided under the applicable section of the act—here, MCL 15.271.49 A party cannot\n\nsimply assert a meritless claim for injunctive relief under MCL 15.271 in the hope that\n\none of its other claims will yield some fruit, and then bootstrap its claim for court costs\n\nand actual attorney fees on the other relief provided.\n\n         In sum, when considering both the plain meaning of the critical phrase in context\n\nas well as its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme, MCL 15.271 limits the\n\naward of attorney fees to cases in which the public body persists in violating the act, a\n\nsuit is brought to enjoin such behavior, and that suit is successful in obtaining injunctive\n\nrelief. Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase “succeeds in obtaining relief in the\n\naction” necessarily mandates that the plaintiff succeed in obtaining injunctive relief, not\n\njust any relief, in order to be entitled to court costs and actual attorney fees under\n\nMCL 15.271(4).\n\n\n\n49\n     See South Haven, 478 Mich at 529.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f         In so holding, we acknowledge the line of contrary holdings of the Court of\n\nAppeals. But, for the reasons explained above, the Ridenour court and the cases that\n\nfollowed it impermissibly strayed from the plain language of MCL 15.271(4).50 There is\n\nno allowance in the statute for obtaining the equivalent of relief—rather the plaintiff must\n\nobtain injunctive relief, as sought in commencing the action.51 The Court of Appeals has\n\nunfortunately perpetuated this error in numerous cases since Ridenour.52 Because these\n\ndecisions have incorrectly extended the entitlement to court costs and actual attorney fees\n\nbeyond the scope articulated by the Legislature, we overrule Ridenour and its progeny to\n\nthe extent that those cases allow for the recovery of attorney fees and costs under\n\nMCL 15.271(4) when injunctive relief was not obtained, equivalent or otherwise.\n\n                                        IV.

Despite this long line of\n\nprecedent, at no time has the Legislature taken steps to amend MCL 15.271(4) in\n\nresponse. Because I believe that these cases properly interpreted and effectuated the\n\nLegislature’s intent, I respectfully dissent.\n\n       In 1968, the Legislature enacted an open meetings law to consolidate a\n\n“patchwork of statutes” that required accountability and openness in governmental\n\faffairs.

Specifically, by addressing a longstanding\n\nconcern regarding the public’s access to governmental decision-making,1 the statute’s\n\naim was to “ ‘serve as both a light and disinfectant in exposing potential abuse and\n\nmisuse of power.’ ” Booth, 444 Mich at 223, quoting Sunshine or Shadows, 1977 Det C\n\nL Rev at 617. Although the goals of the 1968 statute were laudable, the statute was\n\nflawed: “because the 1968 statute failed to impose an enforcement mechanism and\n\npenalties to deter noncompliance, nothing prevented the wholesale evasion of the act’s\n\nprovisions” by public bodies, and the law was often ignored. Booth, 444 Mich at 221.\n\nSee, also, Sunshine or Shadows, 1977 Det C L Rev at 619. To remedy this, the statute\n\nwas “comprehensively revise[d]” in 1976 to provide for enforcement by way of several\n\nmechanisms, including actions by private citizens to vindicate, not primarily personal\n\nrights, but the rights of the public at large.     Booth, 444 Mich at 222.       One such\n\nenforcement provision is MCL 15.271(4), which provides that a successful party is\n\nentitled to court costs and actual attorney fees. Specifically, MCL 15.271(4) states:\n\n       If a public body is not complying with this act, and a person commences a\n       civil action against the public body for injunctive relief to compel\n       compliance or to enjoin further noncompliance with the act and succeeds in\n1\n See Sunshine or Shadows, 1977 Det C L Rev at 617 (“Concern for public access to\ngovernmental decision-making is not new. . . .

Stated another way, at issue\n\nis whether the Court of Appeals has correctly effectuated the Legislature’s intent by\n\nholding that the absence of formal injunctive relief does not preclude a plaintiff from\n\nrecovering statutory attorney fees and costs under MCL 15.271(4). Considering the\n\npurposes behind the OMA, including the Legislature’s conscious choice to enact a citizen\n\nenforcement provision aimed at ensuring compliance with the OMA, I cannot conclude\n\nthat the last 33 years of Court of Appeals precedent was in error.\n\n       As previously noted, four years after the effective date of MCL 15.271(4), the\n\nRidenour panel effectively held that declaratory relief granted in lieu of or as the\n\nfunctional equivalent of an injunction supports an award of costs and actual attorney fees\n\nunder the statute. In Ridenour, the plaintiff sought to enjoin the defendant from holding a\n\nclosed meeting.    Although the trial court determined that the defendant’s proposed\n\nconduct would violate the OMA, it determined that injunctive relief was not necessary in\n\nlight of the defendant’s promise that it would comply with the trial court’s decision.\n\nRidenour, 111 Mich App at 801. Despite the trial court’s decision to deny the plaintiff’s\n\nrequest for injunctive relief on that basis, it granted the plaintiff’s request for costs and\n\nattorney fees under MCL 15.271(4), reasoning that the relief that the plaintiff obtained\n\nwas “the equivalent of an injunction.” Id. at 801. On appeal, the Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the award of costs and attorney fees explaining, “No matter how it is viewed,\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fplaintiff received the relief he sought. The [trial court] agreed with plaintiff’s position\n\nand gave a judgment in his favor.” Id. at 806.\n\n       Subsequent panels of the Court of Appeals have followed Ridenour, reasoning\n\nthat, under MCL 15.271(4), “neither proof of injury nor issuance of an injunction is a\n\nprerequisite for the recovery of attorney fees under the OMA”; rather, under the language\n\nof MCL 15.271(4), a “plaintiff need only ‘succeed in obtaining relief in the action,’ ”\n\nand, therefore, declaratory relief, as a form of relief, is necessarily sufficient.

Consequently, in the context of public bodies, a judgment for declaratory\n\nrelief is the “functional equivalent of an injunction.” US Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs, 780 F Supp 2d at 1314 (citations and quotation marks omitted).6 As a final order,\n\na declaratory judgment acts to restrain public bodies from further noncompliance with the\n\nOMA, consistent with the overall purpose of MCL 15.271. Accordingly, as Ridenour\n\nexplained, although a plaintiff might not receive relief in the form of an injunction, the\n\nreceipt of a declaratory judgment upon the finding of an OMA violation is the functional\n\nequivalent of one. Ridenour, 111 Mich App at 806. Although that might not be the case\n\nin a context other than the OMA, considering the purpose of MCL 15.271 and the OMA\n\n\n5\n  Indeed, the evasion of a court’s judgment might trigger other enforcement provisions of\nthe OMA, further supporting the conclusion that declaratory relief, in the context of the\nOMA, acts to restrain noncompliance with the OMA. See MCL 15.272(1) (“A public\nofficial who intentionally violates this act is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine\nof not more than $1,000.00.”); MCL 15.273(1) (“A public official who intentionally\nviolates this act shall be personally liable in a civil action for actual and exemplary\ndamages of not more than $ 500.00 total, plus court costs and actual attorney fees to a\nperson or group of persons bringing the action.”).\n6\n See, also, id. at 1316 (referring to a declaratory judgment against governmental officials\nas a “de facto injunction”); California v Grace Brethren Church, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110749\"><a href=\"/opinion/110749/california-v-grace-brethren-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408; 102 S\nCt 2498; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110749\"><a href=\"/opinion/110749/california-v-grace-brethren-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

In addition to\n\nmandating formal injunctive relief before costs and attorney fees can be awarded, the\n\nmajority now clarifies that an “ongoing violation” is also a prerequisite to obtaining costs\n\nand attorney fees under the OMA. Consequently, the majority opinion effectively gives a\n\npublic body at least one free pass at violating the OMA because, without more, the public\n\nbody’s violation of the OMA, no matter how substantial, is presumably not “ongoing.”7 I\n\ndo not believe that the majority’s apparent interpretation is what the Legislature intended\n\nwhen it adopted legislation aimed at promoting a “new era” of governmental\n\n7\n  The majority does not elaborate on the meaning of “ongoing violation.” However, to\nthe extent that the majority opinion could be read to suggest that a plaintiff cannot bring\nsuit under MCL 15.271 if the OMA violation is already complete at the time suit is filed,\nthat result is inconsistent with decades of precedent.

This constitutes declaratory relief, thus entitling plaintiffs\nto actual attorney fees and costs despite the fact that the trial court found it unnecessary to\ngrant an injunction given defendants’ decision to amend the notice provision after\nplaintiffs filed the present suit”). Such a conclusion would also preclude most OMA\nactions that are brought under MCL 15.271(4) to challenge the alleged erroneous\nprocedures used by a public body. Notably, those actions ultimately assist in bringing\nclarity to the OMA’s requirements, thereby reducing future violations and furthering the\nOMA’s purpose. I imagine that most citizens will not have time to run to the doors of a\ncourthouse the moment a public body makes an erroneous decision to conduct its meeting\nin secret or in violation of the OMA’s notice requirements. But, under the majority’s\napparent interpretation, this may now be required.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\faccountability and public access to governmental decision-making.

After all, upon the trial court’s adverse ruling, the public body need\n\nonly concede defeat to preclude injunctive relief.

Under the majority’s\n\ninterpretation, such a concession will preclude an award to the plaintiff for his or her\n\ncosts of pursuing the litigation even though, as previously explained, a grant of\n\ndeclaratory relief is generally sufficient to make the violation known to the public body\n\nand restrain it from further violating the OMA, which is consistent with the purpose of\n\nMCL 15.271(4) and the purpose of the OMA generally.\n\n       Of particular importance is that, in enacting MCL 15.271(4), the Legislature\n\ngranted individual citizens the right to pursue remedies for OMA violations rather than\n\nrely solely on the Attorney General or county prosecutors. By doing so, the Legislature\n\nseems to have implicitly recognized that there would be times when members of the\n\nexecutive branch could not, or would not, act and that, in those instances, the overriding\n\n\n                                             9\n\fconcern for governmental accountability mandates the availability of causes of action\n\nbrought by private citizens. In light of the Legislature’s choice to allow private citizen\n\nsuits to pursue remedies for procedural OMA violations,8 which vindicate the rights of\n\nthe public at large, I cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to limit this right to the\n\nsmall portion of the population that is capable of pursuing such actions at their own\n\npersonal expense. See Nemeth v Abonmarche Dev, Inc, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572781\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572781/nemeth-v-abonmarche-development-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47; 576 NW2d 641\n\n(1998) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The result of the\n\nmajority’s decision is that the ability of private citizens to bring OMA complaints will, in\n\nall likelihood, be severely curtailed. To penalize private citizens and, consequently, the\n\npublic at large, simply because relief comes in the form of a declaratory judgment, rather\n\nthan injunctive relief, elevates form over substance when, as explained earlier, there is\n\nlittle practical difference between the two forms of relief in this context. Consequently, I\n\ndo not believe that the Legislature intended the majority’s interpretation of MCL\n\n15.271(4), which undermines the OMA’s purpose.\n\n       In this case, plaintiff requested both injunctive and declaratory relief and was\n\nultimately awarded the latter. Because declaratory relief is sufficient to trigger attorney\n\nfees and costs under MCL 15.271(4), I would hold that plaintiff is entitled to costs and\n\nattorney fees, consistent with Ridenour and its progeny.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Compare MCL 15.270 (permitting a private citizen to seek the invalidation of a public\nbody’s decision upon a violation of the OMA) with MCL 15.271 (generally permitting\nprivate citizens to seek compliance with the procedural requirements of the OMA, rather\nthan the invalidation of a public body’s decision).\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       In light of the language, history, and purpose of the act, I cannot agree with the\n\nmajority’s decision to cast aside 33 years of precedent and erroneously write into the\n\nOMA a requirement that the Legislature did not intend—i.e., that a party must obtain\n\nformal injunctive relief as a prerequisite to an award of costs and attorney fees under\n\nMCL 15.271(4). Because I believe that more than three decades of precedent properly\n\ninterpreted and effectuated the Legislature’s intent, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n                                                          Michael F.
