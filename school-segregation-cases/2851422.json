          "plain_text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNo. 98-3550\n\nGeorgeen Stevens,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv.\n\nIllinois Department of Transportation,\n\nDefendant-Appellee.\n\n\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Illinois, Benton Division.\nNo. 96-4358--James L. Foreman, Judge.\n\n\nArgued December 8, 1999--Decided April 11, 2000\n\n\n\n      Before Harlington Wood, Jr., Coffey and Flaum, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n      Flaum, Circuit Judge. Georgeen Stevens brought\nsuit alleging that her employer, the Illinois\nDepartment of Transportation (\"IDOT\"), discharged\nher for reasons related to her disability in\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(\"ADA\" or \"Act\"), 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101 et seq.\nAfter a jury returned a verdict in favor of\nStevens, the district court granted judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict in favor of IDOT. For\nthe reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment\nfor IDOT and dismiss this case for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n      Georgeen Stevens worked as a highway maintainer\nat IDOT’s District 7 Traffic Operations Division\nin Effingham, Illinois for approximately five\nyears, from 1991 to 1996. Maintainers in that\ndivision are responsible for repairing and\nreplacing road signs, striping lines on\ninterstate highways, installing and maintaining\nhighway lights and removing snow. On September\n20, 1993, a mechanical hand lever pump she was\noperating on the job broke and struck Stevens in\nthe right chest area injuring her. As a result of\nthis injury, Stevens began to suffer from a\npainful neurological condition known as reflex\nsympathetic dystrophy. Because of this condition,\n\fStevens was unable to lift more than ten pounds\nwith her right arm or stay outside in\ntemperatures lower than fifty degrees for longer\nthan fifteen minutes without extreme pain.\n\n      Stevens’s doctor wrote various letters to IDOT\nstating that she should be provided with\naccommodations for her disability but that her\nability to work depended on her ability to\nwithstand pain. The doctor stated that she should\nbe allowed to determine her own work limitations\nand that her condition would not worsen or\nimprove even if she worked without the\nrecommended accommodations. Stevens requested\naccommodation from IDOT but informed her\nsupervisors that she was willing to work without\naccommodation if it could not be provided.\n\n      Stevens filed a worker’s compensation claim and\nit was determined that she suffered a 30 percent\npermanent partial disability as a result of the\naccident. After the worker’s compensation\ndecision, IDOT fired Stevens because it concluded\nthat she was not able to perform the functions of\nher job. Stevens then filed claims in federal\ndistrict court under Title VII for sex\ndiscrimination and under the ADA for disability\ndiscrimination. Her Title VII claim was dismissed\non summary judgment and was not appealed. The ADA\nclaim went to a jury trial where a verdict was\nreturned in favor of Stevens.\n\n      After trial, IDOT filed a motion to vacate the\nverdict, claiming that the district court did not\nhave jurisdiction to hear the claim because IDOT\nwas immune from suit under the Eleventh\nAmendment. The trial court denied this motion.\nThe trial court then overturned the verdict,\nentering a judgment as a matter of law in favor\nof IDOT because it found that there was not\nsubstantial evidence to support the jury’s\nconclusion that Stevens could perform the\nessential functions of her job, a critical\nelement of her ADA claim. Stevens now appeals.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n      In our recent decision Erickson v. Board of\nGovernors, No. 98-3614, 2000 WL 307121 (7th Cir.\nMar. 27, 2000), we reexamined our decision in\nCrawford v. Indiana Dep’t of Corrections, 115\nF.3d 481, 487 (7th Cir. 1997), in light of the\nsubsequent Supreme Court decisions in Florida\nPrepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v.\nCollege Sav. Bank, 119 S.Ct. 2199 (1999), and\nKimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 120 S.Ct. 631\n(2000), in which the Court more precisely defined\nthe limits of Congress’s Section 5 power to\nenforce the Fourteenth Amendment. In Erickson, we\nconcluded that the ADA was not enacted pursuant\n\fto a valid exercise of Congress’s Section 5 power\nso that Congress had not effectively abrogated\nthe States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity for\nclaims brought under that Act. We follow the\nmajority’s conclusion in Erickson and we find\nthat IDOT, a department of the State of Illinois,\nis immune from suit brought by an individual in\nfederal court under the ADA./1 We write further\nto more fully explain the reasoning by which we\nhave reached this conclusion./2\n\n      The ADA was enacted \"to provide a clear and\ncomprehensive national mandate for the\nelimination of discrimination against individuals\nwith disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101(b)(1).\nThe ADA specifically targets discrimination in\ntwo broad areas: employment (Title I) and public\naccommodations (Title II). This case only\ninvolves allegations of employment discrimination\nthat fall under Title I. Under Title I, a covered\nentity may discriminate in two ways: disparate\ntreatment of or failure to accommodate a disabled\nemployee. 42 U.S.C. sec. 12112; see Foster v.\nArthur Andersen, LLP, 168 F.3d 1029, 1032 (7th\nCir. 1999); Weigel v. Target Stores, 122 F.3d\n461, 464 (7th Cir. 1997). To make out a claim\nunder the ADA, an individual must show: 1) that\nshe is disabled; 2) that she is otherwise\nqualified to perform the essential functions of\nthe job with or without reasonable accommodation;\nand 3) that the employer took an adverse job\naction against her because of her disability or\nfailed to make a reasonable accommodation. 42\nU.S.C. sec.sec. 12111-12; see Gile v. United\nAirlines, Inc., 95 F.3d 492, 496 (7th Cir. 1996).\nIt is a defense to an ADA claim that an\nemployment criterion that adversely impacts\ndisabled persons is \"job-related and consistent\nwith business necessity.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12113;\nsee EEOC v. AIC Security Investigations, Ltd., 55\nF.3d 1276, 1283 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n      The Eleventh Amendment renders a State immune\nfrom any suit brought by an individual in federal\ncourt unless the State has consented to being\nsued in that forum. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 640\n(\"[T]he Constitution does not provide for federal\njurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting\nStates.\"); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517\nU.S. 44, 54 (1996)./3 Congress may abrogate the\nStates’ Eleventh Amendment immunity and provide\nfor federal jurisdiction over individual suits\nagainst States. However, Congress only has this\npower to abrogate when it is acting pursuant to\nits enforcement power under Section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at\n644; Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 58. Congress may\nnot nullify States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity\nwhen it is operating under its Article I powers.\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 643-44; Florida Prepaid, 119\n\fS.Ct. at 2205; Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 72-73.\n\n      Congress has abrogated Illinois’s Eleventh\nAmendment immunity, if it 1) unequivocally\nexpressed its intent to abrogate the States’\nEleventh Amendment immunity through the ADA, and\n2) acted pursuant to a valid exercise of its\npower under Section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 640; Florida\nPrepaid, 119 S.Ct. at 2205; Seminole Tribe, 517\nU.S. at 55. The text of the ADA makes clear\nCongress’s explicit intent to abrogate the\nStates’ Eleventh Amendment immunity for suits\nbrought by individuals under that statute. See 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12202 (\"A State shall not be immune\nunder the eleventh amendment to the Constitution\nof the United States from an action in Federal or\nState court of competent jurisdiction for\nviolation of this chapter.\"); 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(b)(4) (\"It is the purpose of this chapter\n. . . to invoke the sweep of congressional\nauthority, including the power to enforce the\nfourteenth amendment . . . .\"). Therefore, it is\nonly necessary to discuss the scope of the\nauthority granted to Congress under Section 5 to\nenact the ADA.\n\n      Congress’s enforcement power under Section 5 is\nnot unlimited. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521\nU.S. 507, 518-19 (1997). Section 5 only\nauthorizes Congress to enact legislation that\nremedies or prevents Fourteenth Amendment\nviolations./4 See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 644. In\norder for a legislative enactment to be a valid\nexercise of this power, Congress must \"identify\nconduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nsubstantive provisions, and must tailor its\nlegislative scheme to remedying or preventing\nsuch conduct.\" Florida Prepaid, 119 S.Ct. at\n2207. This does not mean that Congress may only\nprohibit through federal legislation conduct that\nis itself unconstitutional under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Federal legislation may prohibit \"a\nsomewhat broader swath\" than that which is\ndirectly forbidden by the Amendment, provided\nthat the target of the legislation is to remedy\nor prevent unconstitutional conduct. Kimel, 120\nS.Ct. at 644; see City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n518. The ultimate test is that \"[t]here must be\na congruence and proportionality between the\ninjury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end.\" City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n520.\n\n      The analysis begins with identifying the conduct\ntargeted by Congress through the legislation in\nquestion. The ADA purports to have the broad goal\nof \"the elimination of discrimination against\nindividuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(b)(1). The types of discrimination at which\n\fthe statute is aimed are recited in the \"Findings\nand purpose\" section of the Act. 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(a). Some of the \"various forms of\ndiscrimination\" outlined by Congress as targeted\nby the Act include:\n\noutright intentional exclusion, the\ndiscriminatory effects of architectural,\ntransportation, and communication barriers,\noverprotective rules and policies, failure to\nmake modifications to existing facilities and\npractices, exclusionary qualification standards\nand criteria, segregation, and relegation to\nlesser services, programs, activities, benefits,\njobs, or other opportunities.\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 12101(a)(5). The ADA is tailored\nto achieving its goal in part by forbidding\nemployment discrimination against the disabled\nand imposing an affirmative duty to provide\nreasonable accommodation on public and private\nemployers. See 42 U.S.C. sec. 12112.\n\n      Having identified the remedial and preventative\ngoal of the statute, we next proceed to examine\nwhether the conduct targeted by the ADA\nconstitutes a violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. We start with the fundamental\nprinciple that it is the judiciary, not the\nlegislature, that determines what conduct\nviolates the provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 644 (\"The\nultimate interpretation and determination of the\nFourteenth Amendment’s substantive meaning\nremains the province of the Judicial Branch.\");\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519. Therefore, we\nlook to judicial rulings, not congressional\npronouncements, in our consideration of whether\nthe conduct targeted by the ADA is\nunconstitutional.\n\n      Disabled individuals, like any class, are\nprotected by the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985);\nUnited States v. Harris, 197 F.3d 870, 876 (7th\nCir. 1999). We have previously held that the\nlevel of protection afforded to this class is\nthat of rational basis review. See Harris, 197\nF.3d at 876. Under traditional equal protection\nanalysis, it is a violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment for the State to discriminate against\ndisabled persons in an irrational manner or for\nan illegitimate reason. However, the Fourteenth\nAmendment allows the State to single out the\ndisabled for different treatment so long as it\nhas a rational or legitimate purpose. See\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 446-47. As with other\ncharacteristics that receive rational basis\nprotection, a State may rely on disability \"as a\n\fproxy for other qualities, abilities, or\ncharacteristics that are relevant to the State’s\nlegitimate interests.\" Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 646.\n\"That [disability] proves to be an inaccurate\nproxy in any individual case is irrelevant.\" Id.\nFurthermore, it is presumed that distinctions\nmade by the State that are based on disability\nare rational and legitimate. See id.; Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 441. The burden rests on the\nindividual to demonstrate that the government’s\nclaimed purpose is illegitimate or that the means\nused to achieve that purpose are irrational. See\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 646.\n\n      Under the ADA, disabled individuals receive\nsubstantially more protection than provided by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. State practices\naffecting the disabled do not receive the same\npresumption of legitimacy that they do under\nrational basis scrutiny. In many cases, once a\nqualified individual with a disability has\ndemonstrated that the State took an adverse\nemployment action against her because of her\ndisability, the burden shifts to the State to\nshow that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory\nreason for the practice. See DeLuca v. Winer\nIndus., Inc., 53 F.3d 793, 797 (7th Cir. 1995)\n(applying a burden-shifting approach to an ADA\nclaim); but see Pond v. Michelin N. Am., Inc.,\n183 F.3d 592, 597 n.5 (7th Cir. 1999) (noting\nthat the burden-shifting approach only applies to\nclaims for disparate treatment under the ADA and\ndoes not apply to claims for failure to\nreasonably accommodate). Furthermore, under the\nADA it is no longer the case that any rational\nreason will support the State’s action. The ADA\nimposes on the state a duty to accommodate\ndisabled individuals and prohibits the State from\ndenying any accommodation that is determined to\nbe \"reasonable\" under the Act. See Vande Zande v.\nState of Wisc. Dep’t of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 541-\n542 (7th Cir. 1995). As long as the disabled\nindividual is able to perform the essential\nfunctions of the position in question, the State\ncannot choose for a legitimate policy reason to\ntreat disabled employees differently from non-\ndisabled employees. Moreover, while the\nFourteenth Amendment allows the State to make\nbroad generalizations about the disabled, the ADA\n\"starts with a presumption in favor of requiring\nthe employer to make an individualized\ndetermination.\" Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 647; see\nWeigel, 122 F.3d at 466 (noting that \"the ADA’s\n’qualified individual’ inquiry . . . necessarily\ninvolves an individualized assessment of the\nindividual and the relevant position\").\n\n      As with the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct (\"ADEA\") discussed in Kimel, the ADA shifts\nthe burden in a disability discrimination case\n\ffrom the individual to the State, raises the\nlevel of judicial scrutiny from rationality\nreview to a heightened level of scrutiny, and\ndisallows the approximations and generalizations\nthat are permitted for classes that otherwise\nreceive only rational basis protection. In sum,\nthe ADA replaces the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nconstitutional protections with a higher set of\nlegislative standards, thereby making illegal\nunder the ADA conduct that is constitutional\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n      The fact that Congress prohibits some conduct\nthat is constitutional under the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not end our discussion. We also\nexamine the proportionality between the measures\ntaken by Congress pursuant to its Section 5\npowers and the unconstitutional conduct that is\nproperly the target of that enforcement effort.\nSee Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 644; City of Boerne, 521\nU.S. at 520. By proportionality we mean that\n\"[t]he appropriateness of remedial measures must\nbe considered in light of the evil presented.\nStrong measures appropriate to address one harm\nmay be an unwarranted response to another, lesser\none.\" City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530 (internal\ncitations omitted). It is in this respect that\nthis case differs from other cases recently\ndecided by the Supreme Court in this area. Unlike\nwith respect to its enactment of the ADEA, the\nPatent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy\nClarification Act, or the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, Congress made extensive findings\nof discrimination against the disabled to support\nits passage of the ADA. Compare 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101, and Coolbaugh v. State of Louisiana, 136\nF.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir. 1998) (noting the broad\nrange of evidence upon which Congress made\nextensive findings of discrimination against the\ndisabled in support of the passage of the ADA),\nwith Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 649 (\"Congress never\nidentified any pattern of age discrimination by\nthe States\"), Florida Prepaid, 119 S.Ct. at 2207\n(\"Congress identified no pattern of patent\ninfringement by the States\"), and City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 530 (\"RFRA’s legislative record lacks\nexamples of modern instances of generally\napplicable laws passed because of religious\nbigotry.\"). With the enactment of the ADA,\nCongress was not acting to remedy or prevent\nunsubstantiated harm but was attempting to\naddress the documented injury of pervasive\ndisability discrimination.\n      However, not all discrimination against a\nparticular class is discrimination that is\nunconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nAs noted above, discrimination against groups\nthat receive rational basis protection is only\nunconstitutional where that discrimination is\narbitrary and unrelated to a legitimate\n\fgovernment purpose. In this case, the\ndiscrimination targeted by the ADA may well\ninclude such arbitrary and illegitimate\ndistinctions concerning disabled persons.\nHowever, the ADA also undoubtedly prohibits much\nconduct that is permissible under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Vande Zande, 44 F.3d at 541(noting\nthat the discrimination prohibited by the ADA is\nnot only that which is arbitrary or irrelevant to\nlegitimate considerations). The fact that the ADA\ntargets some discrimination that is not a\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment is\nreflected in the Congressional finding that\n\"unlike individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex,\nnational origin, religion, or age, individuals\nwho have experienced discrimination on the basis\nof disability have often had no legal recourse to\nredress such discrimination.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(a)(4). Thus, while the ADA may remedy and\nprevent arbitrary and illegitimate discrimination\nagainst the disabled that is unconstitutional, it\nalso sweeps in a wide area of conduct singling\nout the disabled that is not prohibited by the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n      It is apparent that the broad sweep of the ADA\nis not \"’adapted to the mischief and wrong which\nthe [Fourteenth] [A]mendment was intended to\nprovide against.’\" City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n532 (quoting Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 13\n(1883)) (brackets in the original). As the\nSupreme Court has repeatedly noted, the\nFourteenth Amendment is aimed at preventing\ndiscrimination by the States, as opposed to\ndiscrimination by private actors that may be\naddressed through Congress’s Article I powers.\nSee Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 649; Florida Prepaid, 119\nS.Ct. at 2207; City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530.\nIn its passage of the ADA, Congress appears to\nhave relied on significant findings of\ndiscrimination against the disabled throughout\nsociety. However, these findings do not reveal\nthat the States themselves are discriminating\nagainst the disabled in an arbitrary or\nillegitimate fashion such that it is appropriate\nfor the federal government to step in with\nfederal legislation aimed at compelling\ncompliance with the dictates of the\nConstitution./5 The lack of evidence that the\nStates are pervasively discriminating against the\ndisabled is compounded by the fact that virtually\nevery State in the Union has promulgated state\nstatutes prohibiting discrimination against the\ndisabled in employment./6 Moreover, several\nStates have explicit policies encouraging the\nemployment of the disabled in state government\npositions./7 There is no evidence in the\nlegislative record that the States are acting\ncontrary to these policies or that those States\n\fwhich do not have them are engaged in widespread\ndiscrimination against the disabled. It is only\nwhen the States themselves are engaged in conduct\nthat violates the Fourteenth Amendment that\nCongress is authorized to step in under Section\n5 to remedy and prevent those violations. See\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 645; Florida Prepaid, 119\nS.Ct. at 2211. We do not doubt that occasionally\nStates falter in their efforts to eliminate\ndiscrimination in state employment. However, the\nbroad sweeping federal legislative remedy that is\nthe ADA is out of proportion to correcting the\ntransgressions that do occur. Without more\ndetailed findings concerning a nationwide pattern\nof arbitrary and illegitimate discrimination\nagainst the disabled by the States, the ADA\ncannot be viewed as a proportional and congruous\nresponse to the problem of state-perpetrated\ndiscrimination against the disabled. While the\nADA’s goal of eliminating discrimination against\nthe disabled throughout society may be a laudable\naim for federal legislation, it is not one which\nserves the purpose of enforcing the protections\nprovided by the Fourteenth Amendment. See City of\nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 519 (\"Congress does not\nenforce a constitutional right by changing what\nthe right is. It has been given the power ’to\nenforce,’ not the power to determine what\nconstitutes a constitutional violation.\").\n\n      In conclusion, we wish to emphasize the limited\nnature of our decision in this case as well as\nour decision in Erickson. We have only concluded\nthat States are entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity for suits brought by individuals under\nthe ADA. The limitations on that immunity apply\nwith equal force in this context. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Mississippi, 380 U.S. 128, 140-\n141 (1965); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651\n(1974); Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).\nFurthermore, our decisions do not address the\nvalidity of the ADA as an exercise of Congress’s\nCommerce Clause power. Therefore, in all contexts\nother than that of an individual suing a State in\nfederal court, the ADA retains its full force as\na means of enforcing nationwide standards for\nnon-discriminatory treatment of the disabled.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n      Passage of the ADA was not a proper exercise of\nCongress’s authority under Section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the ADA does not\nabrogate the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity,\nand IDOT, as a department of the State of\nIllinois, cannot be sued without its consent in\nfederal court for a violation of the ADA. We\nconclude that the district court did not have\nsubject matter jurisdiction to hear this case. We\nVacate the district court’s entry of judgment in\n\ffavor of the defendant and Dismiss this case for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n/1 Suits against departments of state government are\nequivalent to suits against a State for purposes\nof Eleventh Amendment immunity analysis. See\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465\nU.S. 89, 100-101 (1983).\n\n/2 Because we find that Illinois is immune from\nsuit, we limit our discussion to that issue and\ndo not discuss the merits of Stevens’s claim. In\naddition, Congress’s power to enact the ADA\npursuant to the Commerce Clause is not an issue\nin this appeal and is not addressed by this\nopinion.\n\n/3 We find no evidence in the record that IDOT\nconsented to suit in federal court. The mere fact\nthat the Illinois Attorney General appeared in\nfederal court to represent the State’s interests\nis not sufficient to constitute consent by the\nState to be sued in a federal forum. See Estate\nof Porter v. Illinois, 36 F.3d 684, 691 (7th Cir.\n1994) (finding that the Attorney General of\nIllinois is not authorized to waive the State’s\nEleventh Amendment immunity).\n\n/4 The Fourteenth Amendment provides:\n\n      Section 1. . . . . No State shall make or\nenforce any law which shall abridge the\nprivileges or immunities of citizens of the\nUnited States; nor shall any State deprive any\nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law; nor deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. .\n. .\n\n      Section 5.

Foreman, Judge.\n\n\nArgued December 8, 1999--Decided April 11, 2000\n\n\n\n      Before Harlington Wood, Jr., Coffey and Flaum, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n      Flaum, Circuit Judge. Georgeen Stevens brought\nsuit alleging that her employer, the Illinois\nDepartment of Transportation (\"IDOT\"), discharged\nher for reasons related to her disability in\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(\"ADA\" or \"Act\"), 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101 et seq.\nAfter a jury returned a verdict in favor of\nStevens, the district court granted judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict in favor of IDOT. For\nthe reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment\nfor IDOT and dismiss this case for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n      Georgeen Stevens worked as a highway maintainer\nat IDOT’s District 7 Traffic Operations Division\nin Effingham, Illinois for approximately five\nyears, from 1991 to 1996. Maintainers in that\ndivision are responsible for repairing and\nreplacing road signs, striping lines on\ninterstate highways, installing and maintaining\nhighway lights and removing snow. On September\n20, 1993, a mechanical hand lever pump she was\noperating on the job broke and struck Stevens in\nthe right chest area injuring her. As a result of\nthis injury, Stevens began to suffer from a\npainful neurological condition known as reflex\nsympathetic dystrophy. Because of this condition,\n\fStevens was unable to lift more than ten pounds\nwith her right arm or stay outside in\ntemperatures lower than fifty degrees for longer\nthan fifteen minutes without extreme pain.\n\n      Stevens’s doctor wrote various letters to IDOT\nstating that she should be provided with\naccommodations for her disability but that her\nability to work depended on her ability to\nwithstand pain. The doctor stated that she should\nbe allowed to determine her own work limitations\nand that her condition would not worsen or\nimprove even if she worked without the\nrecommended accommodations. Stevens requested\naccommodation from IDOT but informed her\nsupervisors that she was willing to work without\naccommodation if it could not be provided.\n\n      Stevens filed a worker’s compensation claim and\nit was determined that she suffered a 30 percent\npermanent partial disability as a result of the\naccident. After the worker’s compensation\ndecision, IDOT fired Stevens because it concluded\nthat she was not able to perform the functions of\nher job. Stevens then filed claims in federal\ndistrict court under Title VII for sex\ndiscrimination and under the ADA for disability\ndiscrimination. Her Title VII claim was dismissed\non summary judgment and was not appealed. The ADA\nclaim went to a jury trial where a verdict was\nreturned in favor of Stevens.\n\n      After trial, IDOT filed a motion to vacate the\nverdict, claiming that the district court did not\nhave jurisdiction to hear the claim because IDOT\nwas immune from suit under the Eleventh\nAmendment. The trial court denied this motion.\nThe trial court then overturned the verdict,\nentering a judgment as a matter of law in favor\nof IDOT because it found that there was not\nsubstantial evidence to support the jury’s\nconclusion that Stevens could perform the\nessential functions of her job, a critical\nelement of her ADA claim. Stevens now appeals.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n      In our recent decision Erickson v.

In Erickson, we\nconcluded that the ADA was not enacted pursuant\n\fto a valid exercise of Congress’s Section 5 power\nso that Congress had not effectively abrogated\nthe States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity for\nclaims brought under that Act. We follow the\nmajority’s conclusion in Erickson and we find\nthat IDOT, a department of the State of Illinois,\nis immune from suit brought by an individual in\nfederal court under the ADA./1 We write further\nto more fully explain the reasoning by which we\nhave reached this conclusion./2\n\n      The ADA was enacted \"to provide a clear and\ncomprehensive national mandate for the\nelimination of discrimination against individuals\nwith disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101(b)(1).\nThe ADA specifically targets discrimination in\ntwo broad areas: employment (Title I) and public\naccommodations (Title II). This case only\ninvolves allegations of employment discrimination\nthat fall under Title I. Under Title I, a covered\nentity may discriminate in two ways: disparate\ntreatment of or failure to accommodate a disabled\nemployee. 42 U.S.C. sec. 12112; see Foster v.\nArthur Andersen, LLP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762068\"><a href=\"/opinion/762068/juanita-e-foster-v-arthur-andersen-llp/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1032 (7th\nCir. 1999); Weigel v.

See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 640\n(\"[T]he Constitution does not provide for federal\njurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting\nStates.\"); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.

However, Congress only has this\npower to abrogate when it is acting pursuant to\nits enforcement power under Section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at\n644; Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 58. Congress may\nnot nullify States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity\nwhen it is operating under its Article I powers.\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 643-44; Florida Prepaid, 119\n\fS.Ct. at 2205; Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 72-73.\n\n      Congress has abrogated Illinois’s Eleventh\nAmendment immunity, if it 1) unequivocally\nexpressed its intent to abrogate the States’\nEleventh Amendment immunity through the ADA, and\n2) acted pursuant to a valid exercise of its\npower under Section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 640; Florida\nPrepaid, 119 S.Ct. at 2205; Seminole Tribe, 517\nU.S. at 55. The text of the ADA makes clear\nCongress’s explicit intent to abrogate the\nStates’ Eleventh Amendment immunity for suits\nbrought by individuals under that statute. See 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12202 (\"A State shall not be immune\nunder the eleventh amendment to the Constitution\nof the United States from an action in Federal or\nState court of competent jurisdiction for\nviolation of this chapter.\"); 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(b)(4) (\"It is the purpose of this chapter\n. . . to invoke the sweep of congressional\nauthority, including the power to enforce the\nfourteenth amendment . . . .\"). Therefore, it is\nonly necessary to discuss the scope of the\nauthority granted to Congress under Section 5 to\nenact the ADA.\n\n      Congress’s enforcement power under Section 5 is\nnot unlimited. See City of Boerne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518-19 (1997). Section 5 only\nauthorizes Congress to enact legislation that\nremedies or prevents Fourteenth Amendment\nviolations./4 See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 644. In\norder for a legislative enactment to be a valid\nexercise of this power, Congress must \"identify\nconduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nsubstantive provisions, and must tailor its\nlegislative scheme to remedying or preventing\nsuch conduct.\" Florida Prepaid, 119 S.Ct. at\n2207. This does not mean that Congress may only\nprohibit through federal legislation conduct that\nis itself unconstitutional under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Federal legislation may prohibit \"a\nsomewhat broader swath\" than that which is\ndirectly forbidden by the Amendment, provided\nthat the target of the legislation is to remedy\nor prevent unconstitutional conduct. Kimel, 120\nS.Ct. at 644; see City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n518. The ultimate test is that \"[t]here must be\na congruence and proportionality between the\ninjury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end.\" City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n520.\n\n      The analysis begins with identifying the conduct\ntargeted by Congress through the legislation in\nquestion. The ADA purports to have the broad goal\nof \"the elimination of discrimination against\nindividuals with disabilities.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(b)(1). The types of discrimination at which\n\fthe statute is aimed are recited in the \"Findings\nand purpose\" section of the Act. 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(a). Some of the \"various forms of\ndiscrimination\" outlined by Congress as targeted\nby the Act include:\n\noutright intentional exclusion, the\ndiscriminatory effects of architectural,\ntransportation, and communication barriers,\noverprotective rules and policies, failure to\nmake modifications to existing facilities and\npractices, exclusionary qualification standards\nand criteria, segregation, and relegation to\nlesser services, programs, activities, benefits,\njobs, or other opportunities.\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 12101(a)(5). The ADA is tailored\nto achieving its goal in part by forbidding\nemployment discrimination against the disabled\nand imposing an affirmative duty to provide\nreasonable accommodation on public and private\nemployers. See 42 U.S.C. sec. 12112.\n\n      Having identified the remedial and preventative\ngoal of the statute, we next proceed to examine\nwhether the conduct targeted by the ADA\nconstitutes a violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. We start with the fundamental\nprinciple that it is the judiciary, not the\nlegislature, that determines what conduct\nviolates the provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 644 (\"The\nultimate interpretation and determination of the\nFourteenth Amendment’s substantive meaning\nremains the province of the Judicial Branch.\");\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519. Therefore, we\nlook to judicial rulings, not congressional\npronouncements, in our consideration of whether\nthe conduct targeted by the ADA is\nunconstitutional.\n\n      Disabled individuals, like any class, are\nprotected by the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Center, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 446 (1985);\nUnited States v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766902\"><a href=\"/opinion/766902/united-states-v-shalynda-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 876 (7th\nCir. 1999). We have previously held that the\nlevel of protection afforded to this class is\nthat of rational basis review. See Harris, 197\nF.3d at 876. Under traditional equal protection\nanalysis, it is a violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment for the State to discriminate against\ndisabled persons in an irrational manner or for\nan illegitimate reason. However, the Fourteenth\nAmendment allows the State to single out the\ndisabled for different treatment so long as it\nhas a rational or legitimate purpose. See\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 446-47. As with other\ncharacteristics that receive rational basis\nprotection, a State may rely on disability \"as a\n\fproxy for other qualities, abilities, or\ncharacteristics that are relevant to the State’s\nlegitimate interests.\" Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 646.\n\"That [disability] proves to be an inaccurate\nproxy in any individual case is irrelevant.\" Id.\nFurthermore, it is presumed that distinctions\nmade by the State that are based on disability\nare rational and legitimate. See id.; Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 441. The burden rests on the\nindividual to demonstrate that the government’s\nclaimed purpose is illegitimate or that the means\nused to achieve that purpose are irrational. See\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 646.\n\n      Under the ADA, disabled individuals receive\nsubstantially more protection than provided by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. State practices\naffecting the disabled do not receive the same\npresumption of legitimacy that they do under\nrational basis scrutiny. In many cases, once a\nqualified individual with a disability has\ndemonstrated that the State took an adverse\nemployment action against her because of her\ndisability, the burden shifts to the State to\nshow that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory\nreason for the practice. See DeLuca v. Winer\nIndus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695187\"><a href=\"/opinion/695187/raymond-deluca-v-winer-industries-inc-a-delaware-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 797 (7th Cir. 1995)\n(applying a burden-shifting approach to an ADA\nclaim); but see Pond v.

Furthermore, under the\nADA it is no longer the case that any rational\nreason will support the State’s action. The ADA\nimposes on the state a duty to accommodate\ndisabled individuals and prohibits the State from\ndenying any accommodation that is determined to\nbe \"reasonable\" under the Act. See Vande Zande v.\nState of Wisc. Dep’t of Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686498\"><a href=\"/opinion/686498/lori-l-vande-zande-v-state-of-wisconsin-department-of-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541-\n542 (7th Cir. 1995). As long as the disabled\nindividual is able to perform the essential\nfunctions of the position in question, the State\ncannot choose for a legitimate policy reason to\ntreat disabled employees differently from non-\ndisabled employees. Moreover, while the\nFourteenth Amendment allows the State to make\nbroad generalizations about the disabled, the ADA\n\"starts with a presumption in favor of requiring\nthe employer to make an individualized\ndetermination.\" Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 647; see\nWeigel, 122 F.3d at 466 (noting that \"the ADA’s\n’qualified individual’ inquiry . . . necessarily\ninvolves an individualized assessment of the\nindividual and the relevant position\").\n\n      As with the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct (\"ADEA\") discussed in Kimel, the ADA shifts\nthe burden in a disability discrimination case\n\ffrom the individual to the State, raises the\nlevel of judicial scrutiny from rationality\nreview to a heightened level of scrutiny, and\ndisallows the approximations and generalizations\nthat are permitted for classes that otherwise\nreceive only rational basis protection. In sum,\nthe ADA replaces the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nconstitutional protections with a higher set of\nlegislative standards, thereby making illegal\nunder the ADA conduct that is constitutional\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n      The fact that Congress prohibits some conduct\nthat is constitutional under the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not end our discussion. We also\nexamine the proportionality between the measures\ntaken by Congress pursuant to its Section 5\npowers and the unconstitutional conduct that is\nproperly the target of that enforcement effort.\nSee Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 644; City of Boerne, 521\nU.S. at 520. By proportionality we mean that\n\"[t]he appropriateness of remedial measures must\nbe considered in light of the evil presented.\nStrong measures appropriate to address one harm\nmay be an unwarranted response to another, lesser\none.\" City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530 (internal\ncitations omitted). It is in this respect that\nthis case differs from other cases recently\ndecided by the Supreme Court in this area. Unlike\nwith respect to its enactment of the ADEA, the\nPatent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy\nClarification Act, or the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act, Congress made extensive findings\nof discrimination against the disabled to support\nits passage of the ADA.

With the enactment of the ADA,\nCongress was not acting to remedy or prevent\nunsubstantiated harm but was attempting to\naddress the documented injury of pervasive\ndisability discrimination.\n      However, not all discrimination against a\nparticular class is discrimination that is\nunconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nAs noted above, discrimination against groups\nthat receive rational basis protection is only\nunconstitutional where that discrimination is\narbitrary and unrelated to a legitimate\n\fgovernment purpose. In this case, the\ndiscrimination targeted by the ADA may well\ninclude such arbitrary and illegitimate\ndistinctions concerning disabled persons.\nHowever, the ADA also undoubtedly prohibits much\nconduct that is permissible under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See Vande Zande, 44 F.3d at 541(noting\nthat the discrimination prohibited by the ADA is\nnot only that which is arbitrary or irrelevant to\nlegitimate considerations). The fact that the ADA\ntargets some discrimination that is not a\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment is\nreflected in the Congressional finding that\n\"unlike individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex,\nnational origin, religion, or age, individuals\nwho have experienced discrimination on the basis\nof disability have often had no legal recourse to\nredress such discrimination.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(a)(4). Thus, while the ADA may remedy and\nprevent arbitrary and illegitimate discrimination\nagainst the disabled that is unconstitutional, it\nalso sweeps in a wide area of conduct singling\nout the disabled that is not prohibited by the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n      It is apparent that the broad sweep of the ADA\nis not \"’adapted to the mischief and wrong which\nthe [Fourteenth] [A]mendment was intended to\nprovide against.’\" City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at\n532 (quoting Civil Rights Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90897\"><a href=\"/opinion/90897/civil-rights-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13\n(1883)) (brackets in the original). As the\nSupreme Court has repeatedly noted, the\nFourteenth Amendment is aimed at preventing\ndiscrimination by the States, as opposed to\ndiscrimination by private actors that may be\naddressed through Congress’s Article I powers.\nSee Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 649; Florida Prepaid, 119\nS.Ct. at 2207; City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530.\nIn its passage of the ADA, Congress appears to\nhave relied on significant findings of\ndiscrimination against the disabled throughout\nsociety. However, these findings do not reveal\nthat the States themselves are discriminating\nagainst the disabled in an arbitrary or\nillegitimate fashion such that it is appropriate\nfor the federal government to step in with\nfederal legislation aimed at compelling\ncompliance with the dictates of the\nConstitution./5 The lack of evidence that the\nStates are pervasively discriminating against the\ndisabled is compounded by the fact that virtually\nevery State in the Union has promulgated state\nstatutes prohibiting discrimination against the\ndisabled in employment./6 Moreover, several\nStates have explicit policies encouraging the\nemployment of the disabled in state government\npositions./7 There is no evidence in the\nlegislative record that the States are acting\ncontrary to these policies or that those States\n\fwhich do not have them are engaged in widespread\ndiscrimination against the disabled. It is only\nwhen the States themselves are engaged in conduct\nthat violates the Fourteenth Amendment that\nCongress is authorized to step in under Section\n5 to remedy and prevent those violations. See\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 645; Florida Prepaid, 119\nS.Ct. at 2211. We do not doubt that occasionally\nStates falter in their efforts to eliminate\ndiscrimination in state employment. However, the\nbroad sweeping federal legislative remedy that is\nthe ADA is out of proportion to correcting the\ntransgressions that do occur. Without more\ndetailed findings concerning a nationwide pattern\nof arbitrary and illegitimate discrimination\nagainst the disabled by the States, the ADA\ncannot be viewed as a proportional and congruous\nresponse to the problem of state-perpetrated\ndiscrimination against the disabled. While the\nADA’s goal of eliminating discrimination against\nthe disabled throughout society may be a laudable\naim for federal legislation, it is not one which\nserves the purpose of enforcing the protections\nprovided by the Fourteenth Amendment. See City of\nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 519 (\"Congress does not\nenforce a constitutional right by changing what\nthe right is. It has been given the power ’to\nenforce,’ not the power to determine what\nconstitutes a constitutional violation.\").\n\n      In conclusion, we wish to emphasize the limited\nnature of our decision in this case as well as\nour decision in Erickson. We have only concluded\nthat States are entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity for suits brought by individuals under\nthe ADA. The limitations on that immunity apply\nwith equal force in this context. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Mississippi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106992\"><a href=\"/opinion/106992/united-states-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140-\n141 (1965); Edelman v. Jordan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1974); Ex Parte Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1908).\nFurthermore, our decisions do not address the\nvalidity of the ADA as an exercise of Congress’s\nCommerce Clause power. Therefore, in all contexts\nother than that of an individual suing a State in\nfederal court, the ADA retains its full force as\na means of enforcing nationwide standards for\nnon-discriminatory treatment of the disabled.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n      Passage of the ADA was not a proper exercise of\nCongress’s authority under Section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the ADA does not\nabrogate the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity,\nand IDOT, as a department of the State of\nIllinois, cannot be sued without its consent in\nfederal court for a violation of the ADA. We\nconclude that the district court did not have\nsubject matter jurisdiction to hear this case. We\nVacate the district court’s entry of judgment in\n\ffavor of the defendant and Dismiss this case for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n/1 Suits against departments of state government are\nequivalent to suits against a State for purposes\nof Eleventh Amendment immunity analysis. See\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100-101 (1983).\n\n/2 Because we find that Illinois is immune from\nsuit, we limit our discussion to that issue and\ndo not discuss the merits of Stevens’s claim. In\naddition, Congress’s power to enact the ADA\npursuant to the Commerce Clause is not an issue\nin this appeal and is not addressed by this\nopinion.\n\n/3 We find no evidence in the record that IDOT\nconsented to suit in federal court. The mere fact\nthat the Illinois Attorney General appeared in\nfederal court to represent the State’s interests\nis not sufficient to constitute consent by the\nState to be sued in a federal forum. See Estate\nof Porter v. Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678858\"><a href=\"/opinion/678858/the-estate-of-leroy-porter-by-its-administrator-ernest-nelson-ernest/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 691 (7th Cir.\n1994) (finding that the Attorney General of\nIllinois is not authorized to waive the State’s\nEleventh Amendment immunity).\n\n/4 The Fourteenth Amendment provides:\n\n      Section 1. . . . . No State shall make or\nenforce any law which shall abridge the\nprivileges or immunities of citizens of the\nUnited States; nor shall any State deprive any\nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law; nor deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. .\n. .\n\n      Section 5. The Congress shall have power to\nenforce, by appropriate legislation, the\nprovisions of this article.\n\n/5 The dissent in Erickson notes that Congress made\nfindings concerning discrimination against the\ndisabled in areas such as education, health care\nand transportation that are traditionally\nprovided, at least in part, by state governments.\nErickson, No. 98-3614, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">307121</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *12.\nHowever, there is no indication that any\ndiscrimination found by Congress was arbitrary or\nirrational such that it would constitute a\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n/6 See Ala.
