R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Anita Trammell, who was\nappointed Interim Warden of Oklahoma State Penitentiary on September 24,\n2012, is automatically substituted for Randall G. Workman as Respondent in this\ncase.\n\f      Defendant Micheal Lee Wilson 1 was convicted of first-degree murder and\n\nrobbery with a dangerous weapon in Oklahoma state court and sentenced to death.\n\nOn direct appeal the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) ordered\n\ndismissal of his robbery conviction but affirmed his murder conviction and death\n\nsentence. See Wilson v. State, 983 P.2d 448, 463, 473 (Okla. Crim. App. 1998)\n\n(Wilson I). Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 in\n\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, but the\n\ndistrict court denied his application. See Wilson v. Sirmons, No. 00-CV-\n\n147CVEFHM, 2006 WL 2289777 (N.D. Okla. Aug. 8, 2006) (Wilson II). We\n\naffirmed in part, but vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on\n\nDefendant’s claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the\n\nsentencing phase of his trial. See Wilson v. Sirmons, 536 F.3d 1064 (10th Cir.\n\n2008) (Wilson III), reinstated sub nom., Wilson v. Workman, 577 F.3d 1284 (10th\n\nCir. 2009) (Wilson IV) (en banc). After holding the evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that Defendant had failed to establish that his trial counsel had\n\nperformed deficiently or that counsel’s alleged failures had affected the outcome\n\nof the penalty phase, and it again denied the writ. See Wilson v. Workman, No.\n\n00-CV-0147-CVE-FHM, 2011 WL 744661 (N.D. Okla. Feb. 23, 2011) (Wilson V).\n\n\n      1\n       Although he has been referred to as “Michael Lee Wilson” throughout this\ncase, we are informed and the record reflects that the correct spelling of\nMr. Wilson’s first name is “Micheal.”\n\n                                         -2-\n\fThe district court granted Defendant a certificate of appealability (COA) on his\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, and Defendant appealed. See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253(c)(1)(A) (requiring a COA to appeal the denial of a § 2254 application).\n\n           We affirm the denial of Defendant’s habeas application. In light of the\n\nevidence presented at the hearing before the district court, he has not shown that\n\nhe was prejudiced by the alleged deficiencies in his counsel’s performance at\n\ntrial. 2\n\nI.         BACKGROUND\n\n           A.    The Murder\n\n           In 1995 Defendant worked at a QuikTrip convenience store in Tulsa,\n\nOklahoma. He, along with accomplices Billy Alverson, Darwin Brown, and\n\nRichard Harjo, planned to rob the store. In the early morning hours of\n\nFebruary 26, 1995 (two days before Defendant’s 20th birthday), the four men\n\nentered the QuikTrip, loitering for about an hour while Defendant conversed with\n\nthe victim, Richard Yost, the employee on duty. In one chilling exchange,\n\nDefendant, just 14 minutes before the assault began, asked Yost how long he\n\nplanned to work at QuikTrip. When Yost answered that he hoped to become store\n\nmanager someday, Defendant responded “For real?” R., Vol. 3 Tr. Feb. 20, 1997,\n\nat 29–30. The conversation and other events in the store were captured on the\n\n\n           2\n       We thank counsel for both Defendant and the State for their skillful\nadvocacy in this appeal.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fstore’s surveillance-camera recording, obtained by law-enforcement officers from\n\nAlverson’s home.\n\n       While Yost was cleaning the store’s coolers, the four men attacked him and\n\ndragged him into a back room. Alverson and Harjo briefly left the store while\n\nYost screamed for help. The two men returned with a black aluminum baseball\n\nbat and went to the back room, where the robbers beat Yost to death with the bat.\n\nYost was handcuffed during the beating: a piece of handcuff later recovered from\n\nhis skull indicated that he was conscious and attempting to ward off blows for at\n\nleast part of the fatal attack.\n\n       During the beating Defendant left the back room, donned a QuikTrip jacket,\n\nand began attempting to remove the store’s safe from its position under the\n\ncounter. As customers entered the store, Defendant greeted them, rang up their\n\ntransactions, and wished them a good day. After dislodging the safe, Defendant\n\nand his three accomplices fled the store with the safe, the contents of the cash\n\ndrawer, and the surveillance video. Yost’s body, lying in a pool of blood, milk,\n\nand beer, was discovered by a customer within a few hours.\n\n       All four culprits were arrested later that day. Under police interrogation\n\nDefendant confessed to participating in the crime. He stated that the robbery and\n\nYost’s killing had been planned for two weeks. Corroborating this admission was\n\nevidence that the body alarm typically worn by QuikTrip employees on overnight\n\nshifts had been found missing from the store the week before the murder. The\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsafe, the surveillance tape, and several other items from the QuikTrip were\n\nrecovered from Alverson’s home.\n\n      B.    The Penalty Phase at Trial\n\n      Evidence was presented during the guilt phase of Defendant’s trial on\n\nFebruary 11, 12, and 13, 1997. He did not present any evidence other than the\n\ntape-recorded statement of codefendant Brown. Given the irrefutable evidence of\n\nguilt, the penalty phase, which began on February 18, was the true contest.\n\n            1.     The State’s Case\n\n      The State alleged three aggravating factors to justify the death penalty: (1)\n\nthat the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing arrest or\n\nprosecution, (2) that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and\n\n(3) that Defendant was a continuing threat to society because of the probability\n\nthat he would commit future crimes of violence. See Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 701.12\n\n(2011). The first aggravator—murder to avoid arrest or prosecution—was\n\nobvious from the evidence at the guilt stage of trial. For the other aggravators,\n\nthe State offered additional evidence.\n\n      To support the second aggravator, a forensic pathologist testified that in his\n\nopinion Yost would have suffered during the attack unless he had been rendered\n\nimmediately unconscious, and he described Yost’s injuries, including wounds to\n\nYost’s hand and scalp, that indicated his efforts to defend himself. See\n\nWillingham v. State, 947 P.2d 1074, 1084 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997) (For a jury to\n\n                                         -5-\n\ffind that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, “the State must prove\n\nconscious serious physical abuse or torture prior to death.”).\n\n      To prove the continuing-threat aggravator, the State called police witnesses\n\nwho testified about two recent offenses. First, Defendant had been convicted as\n\nan accessory after the fact to the murder of a woman in September 1994 (five\n\nmonths before the Yost murder). The conviction was based on his taking\n\npossession of a gun at the principal’s request, although, as noted by the OCCA,\n\n“the facts revealed that he may have been more involved in this drive-by shooting\n\nby providing ammunition for the gun on the day of the murder.” Wilson I, 983\n\nP.2d at 466. Second, 10 days before Yost’s murder, police had seized a loaded\n\nrevolver from Defendant’s car during a traffic stop. Codefendant Brown was also\n\nin the car. On cross-examination Defendant’s counsel pointed out that Brown was\n\nthe one charged with possession of the gun and suggested that Defendant was not\n\naware of the gun’s presence.\n\n      The State also presented victim-impact statements from Yost’s wife and\n\nmother, both of whom testified to how their lives had been tragically affected by\n\nYost’s murder.\n\n             2.    The Defense Mitigation Case\n\n                   a.     The Lay Witnesses\n\n      In the mitigation case the defense put on five lay witnesses and one expert.\n\nTwo of Defendant’s former teachers and two fellow church members offered\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsimilar testimony: that they had known Defendant as a polite, respectful, well-\n\nbehaved, and intelligent young man and that the murder for which he had been\n\nconvicted did not represent “the Mike Wilson [they] knew.” R., Vol. 3 Tr.\n\nFeb. 19, 1997, at 11. On cross-examination the prosecutor elicited that three of\n\nthe witnesses had last seen Defendant between two and five years earlier and that\n\nhis criminal conduct suggested that his behavior and character might have\n\nchanged in the interim.\n\n      The other lay witness was Defendant’s mother, Patricia Taylor. She\n\ntestified that his father frequently used crack cocaine, was often absent, and was\n\nnot a positive influence on Defendant’s life; that she had cultivated a loving\n\nrelationship with Defendant and had attempted to inculcate positive values in him;\n\nand that she had visited Defendant in jail almost every week. She also testified\n\nthat she turned over to police some physical evidence of the murder, including the\n\nmurder weapon, explaining that she had acted to follow “the rules,” and that she\n\nexpected that doing so would help her son in the long run. Id. at 99. She further\n\ntestified that immediately after the murder (but before his apprehension),\n\nDefendant had returned home in a disturbed emotional state. He said that a man\n\nhad been killed in a robbery at the QuikTrip, although he did not know how it\n\nhappened. They then prayed together about the crime. Ms. Taylor concluded\n\nwith a plea for her son’s life.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f                    b.     Dr. Reynolds\n\n      Defendant’s expert witness was Dr. Allan Eugene Reynolds, a clinical\n\npsychologist. On direct examination Dr. Reynolds testified to some aspects of his\n\npretrial preparation, stating that he had reviewed information about Defendant’s\n\nbackground, including his school, medical, and criminal records; that he had\n\ninterviewed Defendant’s mother; and that he had reviewed statements by lay\n\nwitnesses. In addition, he had met with Defendant on three occasions at the Tulsa\n\nCounty Jail, and had administered several psychological tests to Defendant: the\n\nSlossen Intelligence test; two tests designed to screen for organic brain damage,\n\nthe Bender Gestalt test and the Memory for Designs test; and two personality\n\ntests, the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III. Defendant also completed a psychosocial\n\nquestionnaire, and Dr. Reynolds observed and interviewed Defendant in addition\n\nto the formal testing.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds was not asked about a failure in the testing. He had\n\nadministered the MMPI-2 on February 6, 1997, and sent the responses to be\n\nscored by computer. The PhD psychologist who scored the test reported that the\n\ntest was probably invalid, and Dr. Reynolds informed Defendant’s counsel of the\n\ninvalidity by February 10, the day before trial testimony commenced. But no\n\nretest was administered.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds testified to the results of the valid tests. He reported\n\nDefendant’s IQ as 126, placing him in the “superior” range of intelligence. Id. at\n\n                                          -8-\n\f55. He said that there was no indication of organic brain dysfunction but that the\n\npersonality tests showed that Defendant suffered from a “severe personality\n\ndisturbance.” Id. at 57. He explained:\n\n       [T]here were responses and there were scores that indicate that\n       [Defendant] has some very unusual, bizarre types of thinking. That\n       would suggest that at times he’s not or has not periodically been in\n       touch with reality. That he basically does not necessarily function at\n       times in a normal state, but that he has a great deal of emotional\n       pathology.\n\nId. Dr. Reynolds also said that in reviewing the statements of those who knew\n\nDefendant and in observing Defendant himself, he found it “remarkable” that\n\n       no one seemed to have any indication that he would engage in the\n       types of behavior that he did.\n\n       And then on the other hand, the psychological tests show that he has\n       that propensity to engage in that type of behavior. And so there’s a\n       big conflict in terms of what people observed of him and maybe what\n       was going on inside of him.\n\nId. at 58.\n\n       When asked if his psychological analysis could explain “the two Michael\n\nWilsons,” Dr. Reynolds spoke of the differences between Defendant’s two\n\nparents. Id. at 59. He said:\n\n              Well, the social history questionnaire indicates that—and his—\n       his past that he grew up in a family where the father left, who was\n       involved in drugs and alcohol, and pretty much was not involved in\n       Michael’s life.\n              The mother was very strong, caring, disciplinarian and tried to\n       keep the family together. Michael was involved in church. And\n       then, I believe one of the persons that he identified with very closely,\n       a Sunday school teacher, died of cancer. From my interviews with\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      him, he indicated to me that this was very distressing and very\n      upsetting to him.\n             There was a lot of gang activity in the neighborhood where he\n      grew up. The mother sent him off to North Carolina for a while with\n      her sister. And Mike did very well out there in a different\n      environment.\n             So on the one hand, here’s a young man who has an\n      uninvolved father, who’s a role model, was involved in drugs and\n      alcohol, and not particularly caring. And on the other hand, you\n      have a highly structured mother, who provides church and this sort of\n      thing.\n             So you have the two pictures of Mike. On the one hand, you\n      have the picture of the Sunday school-going child. On the other\n      hand, you have the picture of the gang and uninvolved father, who\n      did not set a particularly good role model.\n             When he got out of both of those environments and went off to\n      North Carolina, apparently there he did very well. I believe that his\n      sister and his brother-in-law were involved in the Marines, provided\n      a lot of structure for him.\n             So if we look at the environments to which he was exposed to\n      does explain somewhat of the two type of Michael’s [sic] that you\n      have, depending where he was at as to who he identified with.\n\nId. at 59–61.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds testified about the gang violence to which Defendant had\n\nbeen exposed from a young age. He identified several particularly traumatic\n\nexperiences: Defendant’s being shot in a drive-by attack when a young\n\nadolescent, the torching of his home by rival gang members, and the death of his\n\nSunday-school teacher from cancer.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds also suggested that Defendant could be rehabilitated because\n\nof his superior intelligence. He explained:\n\n      [Defendant’s high level of intelligence] provides him, I think, with\n      the intelligence to do something with himself, as well as be a\n\n                                        -10-\n\f       contributor to others in terms of understanding his world,\n       understanding what he’s done, what other persons have done. And\n       therefore, with this level of intelligence, he has the ability to make\n       contributions that may be helpful to those who have lesser\n       intelligence.\n\nId. at 63.\n\n       The prosecutor’s cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds elicited a much more\n\ndisturbing picture of Defendant. It began with the suggestion that Defendant’s\n\npersonality disturbance was that of a psychopath:\n\n       Q: Doctor, in your experience are there psychopathic criminals who\n       have superior intelligence?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Makes them all the better, doesn’t it?\n\n       A: It can.\n\n       Q: You referenced a severe personality disturbance and mental\n       disorder, I believe you testified?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Doesn’t that mean he’s a psychopath?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: It doesn’t?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: The sharp contrast he exhibits that you testified to, aren’t those\n       the classic designs of a psychopath? “Yes” or “no”?\n\n       A: It can be.\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f      Q: And aren’t psychopaths the most likely to re-offend, based on the\n      studies?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\nId. at 65. Later, Dr. Reynolds agreed that “a 19-year-old with superior\n\nintelligence know[s] right from wrong.” Id. at 66.\n\n       The prosecutor used published studies to attack the validity of the\n\nintelligence and personality tests employed by Dr. Reynolds. But he also elicited\n\nsome of their conclusions. Dr. Reynolds conceded that the MCMI-III interpretive\n\nreport stated that “[t]he guiding principle of [Defendant] is to outwit others,\n\nexerting power over them before they can exploit him,” id. at 69 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), and that Defendant was “easily provoked” and “may\n\nexpress sudden and unanticipated brutality,” id. at 70 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). He also acknowledged that Defendant had responded “True” to the\n\nfollowing statements on the test questionnaire: “Lately, I have begun to feel like\n\nsmashing things”; “I often get angry with people who do things slowly”; “I have\n\nhad to be really rough with some people to keep them in line”; and “I sometimes\n\nfeel crazy-like or unreal when things start to go badly in my life.” Id. at 70–71\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Later in the cross-examination the prosecutor returned to the psychopath\n\ntheme, referring to Dr. Reynolds’s prior testimony about the sharp contrast\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fbetween Defendant’s behavior before family and friends and his violent criminal\n\nconduct:\n\n       Q: [I]sn’t this consistent with the characteristics of a psychopath?\n\n       A: As I stated before, it can be.\n\n       Q: Well, aren’t superficial charm and good intelligence, coupled\n       with cunning and manipulative lack of implusivity [sic] behavior\n       characteristics of a psychopath?\n\n       A: Yes, they are.\n\n       Q: And that’s what Mr. Wilson has, isn’t it?\n\n       A: Some of those characteristics, he has.\n\n       Q: And you told this jury that psychopaths are the most likely to re-\n       offend based on the studies?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\nId. at 76.\n\n       Dr. Reynolds acknowledged that he did not know what mental-health\n\ntreatment options would be available to Defendant in prison, and he agreed that\n\nwithout treatment, Defendant would represent a continuing threat to others.\n\nDr. Reynolds also conceded that past violent behavior is the best predictor of\n\nfuture violence.\n\n       On redirect examination Dr. Reynolds defended his use of the\n\npsychological instruments challenged by the prosecutor. He also expanded on the\n\nsignificance of Defendant’s answer on the MCMI-III that he felt “crazy-like”:\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f      Q: What things were you referring to, sir, whenever you told us\n      there were evidences of severe mental disorder in this person?\n\n      A: Well, I think probably the most classic example would be in the\n      Noteworthy Responses when [the prosecutor] asked me to read one\n      of the questions, which “Sometimes I feel crazy-like or unreal when\n      things start to go badly in my life,” he answers true.\n\nId. at 82. Dr. Reynolds went on to note that “[u]sually, unless someone’s pretty\n\ndisturbed, they’re not going to answer that true, they’re going to answer that\n\nfalse.” Id.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds further testified that the tests were mere components of his\n\noverall evaluation of Defendant, to be interpreted in light of clinical experience,\n\ninterviews, observations, and Defendant’s social history. He stated that\n\nDefendant’s mental disorders were treatable, reiterated his opinion that\n\nDefendant’s high intelligence made him a good prospect for rehabilitation, and\n\nagreed that in light of Defendant’s upstanding behavior in school and church, a\n\nstructured setting such as prison might have a positive influence on Defendant’s\n\nconduct and mental state.\n\n      During closing argument the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the cross-\n\nexamination of Dr. Reynolds, describing Defendant as a “psychopath” and a\n\n“psychopathic killer.” Id., Tr. Feb. 20, 1997, at 46. The defense attorneys had\n\nlittle to counter the argument. They did not discuss Defendant’s mental disorder\n\nduring closing, except to suggest that the “psychopath” label obscured\n\nDefendant’s humanity and positive characteristics. Their main themes in closing\n\n                                         -14-\n\fwere that there was no evidence proving that Defendant personally participated in\n\nthe beating of Yost, and that Defendant could reform his life and be of benefit to\n\nothers if allowed to live.\n\n      The jury found all three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt and sentenced Defendant to death.\n\n      C.     The § 2254 Evidentiary Hearing\n\n      From the time of his original appeal to the OCCA to the present, Defendant\n\nhas contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during the\n\npenalty phase of his trial. Adopting the language of a member of this court,\n\nDefendant has referred to the cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds as a “‘train\n\nwreck.’” E.g., Aplt. Br. at 11 (quoting Wilson III, 536 F.3d at 1076 (McConnell,\n\nJ.)). He attributes Dr. Reynolds’s poor performance to tardy and inadequate\n\npreparation by defense counsel. He emphasizes that counsel did not retain\n\nDr. Reynolds until shortly before trial and failed to arrange for Defendant to\n\nretake the MMPI-2 personality test when the initial results turned out to be\n\ninvalid. He contends that trial counsel also failed to conduct adequate interviews\n\nof family members that would have enabled Dr. Reynolds to arrive at a diagnosis\n\nthat could have changed the jury’s decision to impose the death penalty.\n\n      To give Defendant an opportunity to show the inadequacy of his counsel’s\n\nperformance and what could have been accomplished through the additional steps\n\nthat he believes counsel should have taken, this court ordered the district court to\n\n                                        -15-\n\fconduct an evidentiary hearing. See Wilson III, 536 F.3d at 1096. The hearing\n\nwas held on July 28, 2010. Testifying were Dr. Reynolds; Defendant’s lead trial\n\ncounsel, Joe Paul Robertson, who was director of the Oklahoma Indigent Defense\n\nSystem at the time of the hearing; and Defendant’s second-chair trial counsel,\n\nKent Hudson. For our purposes, we need focus only on Dr. Reynolds’s\n\ntestimony. 3\n\n               1.   Dr. Reynolds’s Testimony on Direct\n\n      The thrust of Dr. Reynolds’s direct examination was to show that if defense\n\ncounsel had asked him to do before trial what he did only after the jury had\n\nsentenced Defendant to death, he could have arrived at a diagnosis of mental\n\ndisease that would have explained Defendant’s evil misconduct in a way that\n\nwould generate sympathy from the jury. Dr. Reynolds was purportedly able to\n\narrive at that diagnosis—schizophrenic paranoid personality disorder or paranoid\n\nschizophrenic disorder—because he now had a valid MMPI test and had\n\ninterviews (of Defendant’s family and girlfriend) establishing the delusions and\n\n\n      3\n         Mr. Robertson had little specific recollection of his representation of\nDefendant. He did not recall being told by Dr. Reynolds that more time was\nneeded to test Defendant, or that the results of the MMPI-2 personality test were\ninvalid. He suggested that the late hiring of Dr. Reynolds was due to budgetary\nconstraints and to a desire not to turn over Dr. Reynolds’s raw data to the State\nuntil absolutely necessary.\n       Mr. Hudson testified that he did not recall any coordination of strategy\nbetween the lay witnesses (whom he handled) and the expert testimony. He also\ntestified that during his many interactions with Defendant, he had never noticed\nany signs or symptoms of mental illness.\n\n                                       -16-\n\fhallucinations necessary for the diagnosis. The new diagnosis would also have\n\nenabled him to fend off suggestions by the prosecutor that Defendant is a\n\npsychopath.\n\n      Defense counsel began by marching Dr. Reynolds through his pretrial\n\npreparation and his meetings with Defendant. In answer to a question by the\n\ncourt, he then explained the meaning of the invalidity of the MMPI-2 test:\n\n      [W]hen the individual takes the test in a manner that shows that there\n      may be a variety of reasons that would not allow the test results to be\n      used simply because he answered and his responses were in such a\n      way, that, let’s say, for example, maybe he had a low reading level,\n      he was confused, or he tried to manipulate the test, or let’s say he\n      was inconsistent with his answers.\n\nR., Vol. 2 at 62. Even though the test was invalid, Dr. Reynolds thought that the\n\nresults “indicated that there was a severe disturbance,” id. at 63, and he felt that\n\nhe needed more information to determine what was going on. (The computer-\n\nscored report on the test said, “Many individuals with this profile are considered\n\nto have severe Personality Disorders; however, the possibility of Schizophrenia,\n\nParanoid type, or of a Bipolar Affective Disorder should also be considered.” Id.,\n\nVol. 1 pt. 5 at 912. And the report’s section on “Symptomatic Patterns” said that\n\nDefendant “endorsed a number of extreme and bizarre thoughts, suggesting the\n\npresence of delusions and/or hallucinations.” Id. at 910.) Dr. Reynolds thought\n\nthat he would have told defense counsel “that the test was invalid, we can’t use\n\nthis information, but there is further information here that is important and that is\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fnot totally supported by the MCMI but there’s a need to really know more.” Id.,\n\nVol. 2 at 65. 4 He explained:\n\n      The MCMI really never reported the auditory hallucinations, okay?\n      But where I began to get a tie between the two was the MCMI talked\n      about the paranoid personality. Then I hear the MMPI, the way he\n      answered those questions, talking about voices, et cetera, et cetera, et\n      cetera, and then that began to give me information that there’s\n      something more here that I need to investigate.\n\nId. He said that if he had had more time he “would have redone the MMPI again\n\nand probably given him instructions in terms of how, if he didn’t understand a\n\nquestion, or if he was unable to comprehend what it was asking, to make a note of\n\nit and I would assist him with it so that he would be able to give a more valid\n\nresult.” Id. at 67. He added that he had now done those things.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds then testified about the valid pretrial MCMI-III test. The\n\nresults indicated “that there was a severe personality disturbance, and that the test\n\ngave a variety of diagnoses that could be considered.” Id. at 68. These included\n\nnarcissistic personality disorder with passive-aggressive personality traits,\n\nschizotypal personality features, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder,\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder, and paranoid personality disorder. 5\n\n      4\n         Dr. Reynolds believed that he had said this to defense counsel during a\nmeeting on February 17; but it appears that he probably conveyed this information\nat least a week earlier, because defense counsel informed the court on\nFebruary 10 (the day before trial testimony began) that the test was unreliable.\n      5\n        Dr. Reynolds later described these disorders as follows: A person with a\nnarcissistic personality disorder believes the world revolves around him and may\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                        -18-\n\f      As for the disorder he now diagnosed Defendant as having—schizophrenic\n\nparanoid personality disorder—Dr. Reynolds explained that “it would have to\n\nhave with it auditory hallucinations, and that’s where they’re hearing things,\n\nthey’re hearing things to be told to do, or they’re hearing things, for example, that\n\nthey’re a special person, or maybe there’s evil spirits.” Id. at 78–79. He said that\n\npeople with the disorder “have the paranoid ideas that people are out to get them,\n\nthat they don’t really trust people, that they’re suspicious of others, and he met\n\nthat diagnosis.” Id. at 79. But, he added, people with the disorder can function in\n\nsociety:\n\n      [E]verybody kind of thinks of schizophrenia as somebody who is\n      dysfunctional, completely can’t talk straight, or anything like that.\n      But on the paranoid—schizophrenic paranoid personality disorder,\n      the person still appears quite able to function, and Mr. Wilson did, so\n      he met that criteria as well. It was the combination of his paranoid\n      ideas, the delusions, and the auditory hallucinations that fit that\n      diagnosis.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n      5\n          (...continued)\nexploit others; a passive-aggressive personality trait manifests by redirecting\nhostile or angry feelings from their source to another person or object; persons\nwith schizotypal personality features are not really schizophrenic but are socially\nawkward and tend to withdraw from interactions with others; generalized anxiety\ndisorder involves physiological and psychological symptoms of anxiety\nunconnected to any obvious stressor; bipolar disorder is characterized by mood\nswings, sometimes dramatic, with the subject cycling from manic energy and\ncarefreeness to deep depression; and posttraumatic stress disorder involves\nhypervigilance, depression, or irritability after exposure to a dangerous situation.\nSee R., Vol. 2 at 82, 83, 84, 86, 87.\n\n                                         -19-\n\f      Explaining how he arrived at his diagnosis, Dr. Reynolds testified that the\n\nstatements by lay persons were critical:\n\n      [W]hat clued me in is when he indicated to me about the voices, but\n      when I then got collaborative [sic] information that verified that from\n      the girlfriend, his brother, and some sense of it from his mother, that\n      somehow solidified my essence that now I felt more on the right\n      track, but that’s not what I had before.\n\nId. at 71–72.\n\n      In response to the court’s question about how the diagnosis would have\n\naffected the jury, Dr. Reynolds said that the mental illness could explain\n\nDefendant’s motivations:\n\n             Well, I don’t know how a jury thinks, but I think it may have\n      helped them understand that the motivation for what he did, once\n      they knew about the delusions, once they knew about the voices, and\n      once they knew about his mental illness, would have helped them\n      know a little bit more that maybe he was influenced by his mental\n      illness as averse to being just a raw, bad guy that’s just out there for\n      the fun of it, but that the mental illness had some impact as opposed\n      to being a normal guy that just goes out there and does something\n      heinous, as he did. So I think it had to do with them and it would\n      depend on what their opinion of mental illness is. So I think just\n      knowing that the motivation may have been driven somewhat by his\n      mental illness as opposed to not having that disorder.\n\nId. at 72. Defense counsel later pursued the matter further, asking what was “the\n\nmost crucial information” about Defendant that Dr. Reynolds could have given\n\nthe jury but did not. Id. at 89. Dr. Reynolds replied, “I think the discussion of\n\nhis mental disorders,” and went on to assert that this information “was crucial in\n\nallowing the jury to know every aspect of Mr. Wilson in this part of the trial, to\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fbe able to understand him, possibly understand some of his motivations,\n\nunderstand his behavior, and that his behavior may have had something to do with\n\nhis mental illness.” Id. Dr. Reynolds said that the schizophrenia diagnosis would\n\nhave presented “a different picture” of Defendant had it been available at trial.\n\nId. at 109. He explained that “my part of the trial, it was basically his\n\nintelligence and that he was disturbed. And the picture that we have now is\n\nsomeone who is very seriously disturbed with a psychiatric diagnostic disorder\n\nthat is very, very severe.” Id. He stated that the posttrial diagnosis “superseded\n\nthe antisocial diagnosis,” id. at 96, “simply because of the delusions, the auditory\n\nhallucinations, and the test data.” Id.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds also testified that he could have corrected the prosecutor’s\n\nuse of the term psychopath if he had been properly questioned on redirect\n\nexamination:\n\n      Q: Do you believe that Mr. Wilson’s attorney allowed you to explain\n      the term “psychopath”?\n\n      A: No, he did not.\n\n      Q: Okay. Could you explain the term “psychopath” to the jury had\n      you been asked?\n\n      A: Yeah. Yes.\n\n      Q: What is the meaning of a psychopath?\n\n      A: Well, there is no meaning because it doesn’t exist.\n\n      Q: [W]ell, is it outdated, that it used to exist?\n\n                                          -21-\n\f      A: It’s outdated, yes.\n\n      Q: Okay. Whether it doesn’t exist now or is outdated or not, does\n      that term carry a stigma?\n\n      A: Probably to the lay persons it does, yes.\n\n      Q: And what would that stigma be?\n\n      A: Well, I guess I’ll just put it very simply, in that this is a very\n      dangerous, bad person who has no regard for life of others.\n\n      Q: Did you feel the jury was left with an inaccurate depiction of\n      Mr. Wilson?\n\n      A: Well, I think they got part of Mr. Wilson, but I don’t think they\n      got more of what was there, but I can’t say that it was inaccurate.\n      [I]f the part maybe you’re referring to is being defined as a\n      psychopath, that was inaccurate. But they did get other parts of him.\n\n      Q: Is being depicted as a psychopath harmful?\n\n      A: Certainly, yes.\n\nId. at 91–92.\n\n                2.   Cross-Examination of Dr. Reynolds\n\n      The prosecutor’s cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds at the evidentiary\n\nhearing was, if anything, more devastating to Defendant’s case than the trial\n\ncross-examination of Dr. Reynolds had been. Rather than reporting the cross-\n\nexamination in chronological order, we organize it by subject matter.\n\n                     a.    Use of the Term Psychopath\n\n      The prosecutor began by pointing out that the term psychopath was not as\n\nclinically inappropriate or outdated as Dr. Reynolds had suggested. He noted that\n\n                                         -22-\n\fthe American Psychiatric Association’s widely used and authoritative Diagnostic\n\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. Text Revision 2000)\n\n(DSM-IV-TR), itself says that the term has been used as another name for\n\nantisocial personality disorder. Indeed, Dr. Reynolds himself had used the term\n\nshortly after the trial. The affidavit that he drafted for Defendant’s state-court\n\nappeal stated that “psychopath is a term associated with antisocial personality\n\ndisorder.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 1011. (The statement was deleted from the affidavit\n\nfiled with the OCCA.) Dr. Reynolds responded that it would nevertheless be\n\nincorrect to use the term because “it’s not a DSM-IV diagnosis any longer,” id.,\n\nVol. 2 at 114, and, in any event, as his affidavit quoted the DSM-IV, “‘Antisocial\n\nbehavior that occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or a manic\n\nepisode should not be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder’ or\n\npsychopathic personality.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 1011.\n\n                    b.    Effect of Mental Disorder on Defendant’s\n                          Participation in the Murder\n\n      The prosecutor challenged whether Dr. Reynolds’s diagnosis of Defendant,\n\neven if correct, could help explain his behavior at the QuikTrip:\n\n      Q: Doctor, I believe you mentioned on direct examination that you\n      believe your diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia may have helped\n      the jury understand Mr. Wilson’s motivation for what he did. Is that\n      what you testified to?\n\n      A: Something to that effect.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fQ: And, Doctor, you’ve reviewed the surveillance tape from the\nQuik Trip depicting Mr. Wilson’s actions during the commission of\nthe murder; correct?\n\nA: I have.\n\nQ: All right. And will you agree, sir, that that videotape depicts a\nnumber of logical, goal-oriented behaviors on Mr. Wilson’s behalf?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: So there’s no question that when he goes from the cooler, after\nMr. Yost has been herded in there by Mr. Wilson and his\naccomplices, Mr. Wilson goes to the front checkout stand and\nassumes the role of clerk; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Logical, goal-oriented behavior?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. And when Mr. Wilson is conversing with the individuals,\nthe various customers who came into the Quik Trip store that early\nmorning time period, did he seem to have any trouble conversing\nwith them, sir?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: The tape you had had the audio portion of it; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: He’s able to strike up conversations; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: He’s able to help these individuals find whatever it was they\nsupposedly were looking for; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n                                 -24-\n\f      Q: Okay. And he was able to help move them along and get them on\n      out; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And that’s logical, goal-oriented behavior under the\n      circumstances; would you agree?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And the same is true with Mr. Wilson removing the safe from the\n      cabinet; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And I could go on and on. Doctor, that’s a pretty good\n      indication, is it not, of what Mr. Wilson was motivated to do there;\n      right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 127–29.\n\n                   c.      Consistency of Dr. Reynolds’s Diagnosis with the\n                           Test Results\n\n      The prosecutor also challenged Dr. Reynolds’s posttrial diagnosis. He first\n\nquestioned whether it was consistent with the pretrial MCMI-III, which was valid:\n\n      Q: [I]sn’t it true the MCMI-III has several clinical scales that\n      measures for the sort of thought disorders and delusional disorders\n      that would be relevant to a diagnosis of schizophrenia?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: [D]espite that, the MCMI-III did not suggest, as a likely\n      diagnosis, paranoid schizophrenia, did it?\n\n      A: That’s correct.\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f      Q: A diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder suggests the absence\n      of paranoid schizophrenia; is that correct?\n\n\n      A: Well, it would be only the absence of the hallucinations and\n      delusions.\n\nId. at 123.\n\n      The prosecutor then asked about the consistency of the diagnosis with the\n\nvalid posttrial MMPI-2:\n\n      Q: [U]nder “Diagnostic Considerations,” where the report states,\n      “Individuals with this MMPI-2 clinical profile are usually diagnosed\n      as having a personality disorder, antisocial type.”\n\n      A: Uh-huh.\n\n      Q: Okay. And it goes on to say a lot of other things; right?\n\n      A: Correct.\n\n      Q: Basically bolstering the antisocial features of Mr. Wilson’s\n      personality; is that fair to say?\n\n      A: Well, again, you have to understand that this is a hypothesis that\n      you then correlate with collateral data. So the collateral data then\n      supported the bizarre, unusual thinking, things—and it said that I\n      need to take those into consideration, which I did, and therefore, as a\n      clinician, I felt the diagnosis was more clearly of the paranoid\n      schizophrenic than it was the antisocial. As I explained before, there\n      are antisocial characteristics here, for sure.\n\nId. at 126–127 (emphasis added). (The record shows that the computer-scored\n\nreport of the initial but invalid MMPI-2 had actually been more supportive of\n\nDr. Reynolds’s ultimate diagnosis. Its first sentence under “Diagnostic\n\nConsiderations” stated: “Many individuals with this profile are considered to\n\n                                        -26-\n\fhave severe Personality Disorders; however, the possibility of Schizophrenia,\n\nParanoid type, or of a Bipolar Affective Disorder should also be considered.” Id.,\n\nVol. 1 pt. 5 at 912. The same section in the report of the valid test did not\n\nsuggest consideration of schizophrenia, paranoid type.)\n\n      More dramatically, the prosecutor pointed out that the posttrial MMPI-2\n\nemphatically supported a picture of Defendant that correlated closely with the\n\npsychopath image elicited at trial. He asked about a section of the interpretive\n\nreport for the test that described Defendant as posing a continuing threat to\n\nsociety:\n\n      Q: MMPI-2, the second that you administered here, the valid one,\n      sir, refers to the Megargee scale; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: All right. And it classified Mr. Wilson as a type C offender;\n      correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: What does type C offender mean?\n\n      [Discussion of where to find the section of the report]\n\n      A: It indicates that these are difficult and criminal offenders.\n\n      Q: It also goes on to say that, in fact, type C inmates typically have\n      difficulty adjusting to prison life; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: It may be necessary to segregate them from weaker or more\n      vulnerable inmates; correct?\n\n                                         -27-\n\f      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And when it refers to treatment considerations in the last\n      paragraph on the page, the MMPI-2, the second one, the valid one\n      that you generated, it says that, in fact, Mr. Wilson—or individuals\n      with this profile type tend not to be very successful with treatment or\n      rehabilitation programs; is that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And it says it’s because they usually do not seek treatment on\n      their own and have little motivation to alter their behavior. Okay.\n      Well, could that extend to the taking of medication?\n\n      A: You mean whether they’ll take medication or not?\n\n      Q: Correct.\n\n      A: Well, medication is treatment, so it could.\n\n      ....\n\n            THE COURT: And it says . . . “Their suspicious attitudes and\n      deep-seated hostility toward others make them a difficult case for\n      rehabilitation.” That would be counterproductive to a strategy of\n      having an intelligent human being that could do well in a prison\n      environment and be rehabilitated; correct?\n\n             THE WITNESS: Correct.\n\n             THE COURT: It’s inconsistent?\n\n             THE WITNESS: Yes.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 129–131 (emphasis added). 6\n\n      6\n        The full description of Type C offenders from the interpretive report is\nchilling:\n       This client’s profile matches those of Type C offenders in the\n       Megargee typology. Individuals matching this profile type are\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                        -28-\n\f                       d.   Factual Support for Dr. Reynolds’s Diagnosis\n\n      As previously discussed, the basis of Dr. Reynolds’s rejection of the\n\ndiagnosis of “personality disorder, antisocial type” (which was suggested by the\n\nvalid posttrial MMPI-2 report) in favor of his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenic\n\ndisorder was his finding that Defendant suffered from delusions and auditory\n\nhallucinations. On cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds the prosecutor took aim at\n\nthat finding. The finding relied in large part on statements by Defendant’s family\n\nand girlfriend.\n\n      First, the prosecutor asked whether Dr. Reynolds had spoken with any of\n\nthe witnesses other than Defendant’s mother. Although Dr. Reynolds had\n\ntestified on direct examination that he had conducted interviews with at least two\n\n\n\n\n      6\n          (...continued)\n      among the most difficult criminal offenders. They are often viewed\n      as distrustful, cold, irresponsible, and unstable. They tend to have\n      antisocial, aggressive, and hostile attitudes toward others. They\n      engage in violent crimes against other people and usually have an\n      extensive criminal record. They tend to come from deviant and\n      stressful home environments and typically have a great deal of\n      difficulty adjusting to society. They are viewed by others as\n      alienated, bitter, rigid, and dogmatic. Their interpersonal\n      relationships are quite disruptive; their suspicious attitudes and deep-\n      seated hostility toward others make them a difficult case for\n      rehabilitation. Research has supported the view that Type C inmates\n      typically have difficulty adjusting to prison life. It may be necessary\n      to segregate them from weaker or more vulnerable inmates during\n      incarceration.\n\nR., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 1017.\n\n                                         -29-\n\fothers, he retreated from that assertion on cross-examination, saying that he may\n\nhave just relied on their affidavits. The exchange continued:\n\n      Q: Okay. And would it have been important to you to have sat down\n      and spoken with these family members who signed these affidavits?\n\n      A: I felt like the information that I got with them on an affidavit\n      under oath was adequate . . . and that it was valuable.\n\n      Q: Okay. And who—\n\n             THE COURT: How do you know whether that information is\n      true or not?\n\n             THE WITNESS: I don’t. . . . It’s not my job to investigate. I\n      take them for what they tell me. But what I saw was consistency\n      across the board, which gave me some sense that there was\n      truthfulness to it.\n\n              THE COURT: Unless someone drafts the affidavits for them?\n\n              THE WITNESS: True.\n\nId. at 118.\n\n      Later the prosecutor asked about the specifics of the statements by the\n\nvarious witnesses. He began by questioning Dr. Reynolds about his reliance on\n\nthree statements by Defendant’s girlfriend, Tonya Holt. The first was her\n\nstatement that he had told her that his father was dead:\n\n      Q: Okay. And one of the instances from the affidavits that you refer\n      to to support your diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia is Tonya\n      Holt’s affidavit, her statement that the defendant told her that his\n      father was dead; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\fQ: Do you remember that? Well, Doctor, do you recall what kind of\na relationship Mr. Wilson had with his father?\n\nA: It was rather distant and difficult.\n\nQ: Okay. Basically a non-entity in his life?\n\nA: Yes. Pretty much so.\n\nQ: Do you recall, was his father, you know—was he a homeless\nperson? Did he have a house? Do you recall what his social status\nwas in life?\n\nA: I believe that he had an issue with drugs and alcohol.\n\nQ: Okay. So is it possible, sir, that Mr. Wilson told Tonya Holt\nthat—\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.\n\n      THE COURT: Let him ask the question first.\n\nQ: Is it possible, sir, that Mr. Wilson told Ms. Holt that his father\nwas dead because he was embarrassed by his father?\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor; there’s no—\n\n      THE COURT: Calls for speculation?\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Exactly.\n\n      THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nQ: Is there a possible nonpsychotic explanation for Mr. Wilson’s\nstatement to Ms. Holt that his father was dead?\n\nA: None that I have.\n\nQ: None that you have that you received from the sources you read,\nor none that you’ve come up with?\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\f      A: I have no information to indicate that there was a different reason\n      that he might make that statement.\n\nId. at 131–32. 7 Dr. Reynolds apparently had forgotten what Holt had said in her\n\nstatement: “Micheal never explained to me why he said his father was dead. I\n\nthought Micheal meant his father Oscar was not being a father.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5\n\nat 854.\n\n      The second Holt statement about which the prosecutor questioned\n\nDr. Reynolds was her statement that Defendant had said his name was Tom, not\n\nMicheal:\n\n      Q: You cite the fact that Mr. Wilson—and this is according to\n      Ms. Holt’s affidavit—Mr. Wilson denied his name was Michael and\n      introduced himself as Tom. You cite that as a basis to support your\n      diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; correct?\n\n      A: That’s one of the delusions that I cited, yes.\n\n      Q: Okay. And you’ve reviewed the recording of Mr. Wilson’s\n      statement to the police; correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: He gives a confession?\n\n      A: Gave a confession, yes.\n\n      Q: Right?\n      And do you recall in that audio statement he tells the police, in\n      response to questioning, that he used the name Tommy when he\n      identified himself to the newspaper man who came into the store?\n      Do you recall that?\n\n      7\n       Although the objection to the question about embarrassment was sustained\nas speculative, the question later became relevant to probing Dr. Reynold’s bias.\n\n                                       -32-\n\f      A: I don’t. I don’t recall that.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 132–33. The prosecutor did not refer to Holt’s statement in her\n\naffidavit that when Defendant used the name “Tom,” she thought “he was just\n\nplaying.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 855.\n\n      Third, the prosecutor asked Dr. Reynolds about Holt’s suggestion that\n\nDefendant had auditory hallucinations:\n\n      Q: All right. Well, you cite Mr. Wilson’s statement to Tonya Holt\n      that he hears voices and you have to fight them away and pray them\n      away as an example of psychotic behavior supporting your paranoid\n      schizophrenia diagnosis; correct?\n\n      A: Correct.\n\n      Q: Okay. And in this situation, Mr. Wilson basically states that he\n      can control the voices; is that right?\n\n      A: I believe that he tries to control the voices through prayer.\n\n      Q: Okay. Because he states you can pray them away if you just pray\n      hard enough, fight hard enough; is that right?\n\n      A: Well, no, that’s not what he said. I don’t think he said that you\n      can pray them away or if you pray hard enough, but that was an\n      attempt which is very common for people with this disorder to make\n      these voice [sic] goes away. They usually try to do whatever they\n      can, and in this case he used religion to attempt to make the voices\n      go away because they told him to do things.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 133–34. Dr. Reynolds’s recollection was faulty. The affidavit of\n\nHolt in the record states that Defendant told her: “I hear voices & its OK. You\n\n\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fjust have to fight them, you just have to pray them away and they will go away.” 8\n\nId., Vol. 1, pt. 5 at 856.\n\n       Next, the prosecutor asked Dr. Reynolds whether his diagnosis was\n\nsupported by the statement of Defendant’s sister that he had told school officials\n\nthat his mother was white. Dr. Reynolds said that he did not recall how old\n\nDefendant was when he made the statements. The prosecutor reminded\n\nDr. Reynolds that the sister said that it was when they were in school together.\n\n(The sister’s affidavit states that Defendant was “just a kid” at the time. Id. at\n\n864.) He then continued:\n\n       Q: Okay. Sir, would it be unusual for paranoid schizophrenia to\n       onset in a young child?\n\n\n\n       8\n           The entirety of the paragraph from Holt’s affidavit stated:\n\n       After I was raped I had some severe mental problems that finally\n       forced me to seek counseling. I now know that I have been\n       diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I started\n       worrying when I would hear things—voices. I told Micheal about\n       the voices and he told me, ‘its O.K. to hear voices, I hear voices.’ I\n       said, no Micheal this is not like hearing your conscience tell you not\n       to do bad things, they are telling me things. Micheal told me, ‘I’ve\n       heard them too, I hear voices & its OK. You just have to fight them,\n       you just have to pray them away and they will go away.’ That is\n       when I started thinking he is really crazy, he has mental problems. I\n       asked him what kind of voices do you hear? He told me he didn’t\n       want to talk about it and he wouldn’t tell me anymore. I have sought\n       help and my doctor prescribed Zoloft and later on Xanax. I am not\n       on any medication now, and I do not hear the voices anymore.\n\nR., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 856.\n\n                                           -34-\n\f      A: The onset usually begi- —it’s not unusual. I mean, it does occur,\n      it’s not common, but the onset is usually the late teens to the early\n      forties, but it is not uncommon for it to occur in children.\n\n      Q: Okay. And Doctor, you’ve reviewed medical records from\n      Children’s Medical Center in preparation for your trial testimony; is\n      that correct?\n\n      A: That is correct.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 134–35. Dr. Reynolds could not recall when Defendant had been\n\nseen at the center, but he was given records showing that Defendant was 16.\n\nDr. Reynolds then acknowledged that the doctors at the center had found no\n\nindication of psychotic behavior, specifically reporting the absence of delusions\n\nor hallucinations.\n\n      Similarly, the prosecutor suggested that another supposed delusion cited by\n\nDr. Reynolds was not indicative of mental illness:\n\n      Q: Okay. You cite Mr. Wilson’s belief, firm belief that he will be\n      released from prison as an example of unusual behavior supporting\n      your diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; is that right?\n\n      A: I believe that it was along the lines of not the diagnosis but that\n      was a delusional comment.\n\n      Q: Okay. Well, Doctor, have you had any experience with inmates\n      in the correctional system in the course of your career as a\n      psychologist?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And are there a lot of inmates who, in fact, may have an\n      irrational belief that they’re going to be released no matter how\n      strong the evidence is against them?\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\f       A: I think your word was correct, irrational.\n\n       Q: Are they all psychotic?\n\n       A: Of course not.\n\n                 [Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor; irrelevant.\n\n                 THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nId., at 136. 9\n\n       The prosecutor also challenged Dr. Reynolds’s statement in his affidavit\n\nthat Defendant may have been out of touch with reality at the time of trial.\n\nDr. Reynolds admitted that he had not interviewed the trial attorneys on the\n\nmatter.\n\n       Later the prosecutor inquired whether Defendant’s alleged paranoia might\n\nbe rational, rather than delusional:\n\n       Q: All right. In your report, you cite the fact that the defendant\n       believes he’s being plotted against as evidence supporting a\n       diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; correct?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Is it your understanding, sir, that Mr. Wilson was involved in\n       gang life?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Both before—well, at least before he went to jail; right?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       9\n       Although the objection was sustained, the prosecutor could have elicited\nthe same point through a properly phrased question.\n\n                                           -36-\n\f      Q: And do you recall, sir, that, in fact, he was having gang trouble\n      even in jail?\n\n      A: I understand there was some fights in jail. I didn’t know if it was\n      gang-related or not but I know there were some altercations.\n\n      Q: All right. I mean, gang life, the sort of gang life Mr. Wilson had,\n      is that a possible nonpsychotic explanation for his belief that he was\n      being plotted against?\n\n      A: Well, it would certainly fit into gang life, that is correct. And so,\n      therefore, that would be consistent with the development of a\n      paranoid disorder, whether how accurate it was that he was being\n      plotted against or not, but he would probably have, most likely with\n      this disorder, an exaggerated view of how he is out to be gotten or\n      killed. But there had some relative—there was some relevance to the\n      idea that he was definitely being plotted against, yes.\n\n      Q: I mean, you recall the situation where his mother’s house was\n      burned down; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\nId. at 138–39.\n\n      We also note a matter not explored during the hearing. Present in the\n\nrecord submitted to the district court was a telling discrepancy between\n\nDefendant’s responses on the pretrial invalid MMPI-2 and the posttrial valid\n\nMMPI-2. In the pretrial MMPI-2, under the “Critical Items” section for “Mental\n\nConfusion,” the interpretive report indicated that Defendant had answered “True”\n\nwhen asked to respond to the statement “I often hear voices without knowing\n\nwhere they come from.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 922. (Dr. Reynolds’s handwritten\n\nnotes on the pretrial report reflect that Defendant told him that when he was in\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fjail he heard two voices telling him to hang himself. Dr. Reynolds did not recall\n\nwhen he wrote the notes.) But on the posttrial MMPI-2 under the same Critical\n\nItems section, no such response is noted, meaning that Defendant apparently did\n\nnot answer this item “True” during the re-test. When administering the re-test,\n\nDr. Reynolds had instructed Defendant to ask for clarification or assistance if he\n\nhad difficulty understanding any of the questions. 10\n\n      This discrepancy may partly account for the fact that while the invalid\n\nMMPI-2 suggested that “Schizophrenia, Paranoid type” should be considered as a\n\npossible diagnosis, id. at 912, the valid MMPI-2 stated that “[i]ndividuals with\n\nthis MMPI-2 clinical profile are usually diagnosed as having a Personality\n\nDisorder, Antisocial type,” id. at 1017, and did not mention a possible diagnosis\n\nof schizophrenia. Dr. Reynolds testified that it was collateral data from the other\n\nwitnesses’ affidavits and the additional records furnished him by appellate\n\ncounsel that enabled him to arrive at the schizophrenia diagnosis.\n\n             3.    Redirect Examination of Dr. Reynolds\n\n      On redirect examination Dr. Reynolds reiterated his belief that he\n\nreasonably relied on the witness affidavits in forming his clinical opinion, and\n\n      10\n         Defendant’s responses on the “Mental Confusion” section were otherwise\nnearly identical. On the second MMPI-2, Defendant responded “True” to the\nstatement “I find it hard to keep my mind on a task or job.” R., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at\n1026. On the first MMPI-2, no response to this statement is indicated in the\n“Mental Confusion” section. Id. at 921–22. Other than the different responses to\nthat statement and the statement about voices, Defendant’s responses in the\nMental Confusion section were the same on both reports.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fthat he had not needed to interview the witnesses to obtain adequate information.\n\nHe clarified that although the valid MMPI-2 had contained indications of\n\nantisocial behavior, he thought that those patterns were “part of a paranoid\n\nschizophrenic process.” Id., Vol. 2 at 146. He testified that the actions of Type C\n\noffenders can be controlled in a prison. And he stated that the absence of\n\ndelusions and hallucinations reported in Defendant’s medical records from age 16\n\ndid not negate the schizophrenia diagnosis, because the onset of the disorder is\n\ntypically later in life.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n       A.     Standard of Review\n\n       Generally, when an applicant seeks relief from a state court conviction or\n\nsentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, we must apply the deferential standard of\n\nreview established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\n(AEDPA). If the state court adjudicated the federal claim that the applicant now\n\npresses on the merits,\n\n       we may only grant federal habeas relief if the habeas petitioner can\n       establish that the state court decision “was contrary to, or involved\n       an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n       determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” or “was\n       based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n       evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\n\nSaiz v. Ortiz, 392 F.3d 1166, 1175 (10th Cir. 2004) (quoting 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1)).\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\f      On direct appeal from his conviction and sentence, Defendant pressed his\n\nineffective-assistance claim before the OCCA, supported by affidavits from\n\nDr. Reynolds and his family and girlfriend. Defendant requested an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the claim under Rule 3.11, Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals, Title 22, Ch. 18, App. (1995). The OCCA denied relief on the claim and\n\nDefendant’s request for an evidentiary hearing. See Wilson I, 983 P.2d at 471–72.\n\nAlthough noting Defendant’s “attempt to supplement the record with material not\n\nfound in the record,” id. at 472, the OCCA held that on the basis of its “review of\n\nthe trial record,” Defendant had failed to demonstrate either deficient\n\nperformance or prejudice on the mental-health issue, id.\n\n      On Defendant’s prior appeal we held that AEDPA deference was not\n\nrequired because the OCCA’s denial of Defendant’s request for an evidentiary\n\nhearing was not an adjudication “on the merits” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d). We noted (1) the OCCA’s apparent failure to consider Defendant’s\n\nnonrecord evidence in denying his request for an evidentiary hearing, and (2) the\n\nhigher threshold for triggering an evidentiary hearing under the OCCA’s Rule\n\n3.11 than permitted under the federal standard stated in Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668 (1984). See Wilson IV, 577 F.3d at 1290–1300.\n\n      The State argues that we should “restore” AEDPA deference to the OCCA’s\n\ndecision in Wilson I, because the later decision of the OCCA in Simpson v. State,\n\n230 P.3d 888, 905–06 (Okla. Crim. App. 2010), shows that we misinterpreted\n\n                                        -40-\n\fOklahoma’s threshold for an evidentiary hearing. Recently, this court has\n\nadopted the State’s view. See Lott v. Trammell, No. 11-6096, slip op. at 79–83\n\n(10th Cir. Jan. 14, 2013). But we need not decide whether the OCCA’s decision\n\non the record before it requires that we affirm under AEDPA, because we deny\n\nrelief based on the evidence that Defendant asks us to consider.\n\n      In evaluating Defendant’s claim that his Sixth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated by ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing proceedings, we\n\napply the standard laid out in Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687:\n\n      A convicted defendant’s claim that counsel’s assistance was so\n      defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has\n      two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel’s\n      performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made\n      errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’\n      guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the\n      defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the\n      defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious\n      as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is\n      reliable.\n\nIn conducting this two-part inquiry, we need not address the performance and\n\nprejudice prongs in that order. See id. at 697 (Because defendants must establish\n\nboth components to prevail, “a court need not determine whether counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the\n\ndefendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.”). Here, we need address only\n\nprejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -41-\n\f      “An error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant\n\nsetting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on\n\nthe judgment.” Id. at 691. In a challenge to a capital sentence, “the question is\n\nwhether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . .\n\nwould have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” Id. at 695. We “must ask if the defendant\n\nhas met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely\n\nhave been different absent the errors.” Id. at 696.\n\n      To resolve whether there was prejudice, we do not consider omitted\n\nmitigation evidence in a vacuum. In Wong v. Belmontes, 130 S. Ct. 383 (2009),\n\nthe defendant was sentenced to death after his counsel presented evidence of his\n\ndifficult family background during the sentencing hearing but declined to\n\nintroduce certain additional mitigating evidence (including expert testimony to\n\nexplain his behavior, see id. at 388–89, and evidence of a serious illness that\n\ncaused “emotional instability, impulsivity, and impairment of the\n\nneurophysiological mechanisms for planning and reasoning,” id. at 389 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)) out of concern that it would open the door for the\n\nprosecution to introduce evidence of a prior murder committed by the defendant,\n\nsee id. at 385–86. Counsel’s concern that this extremely harmful evidence would\n\nbe admitted if he introduced certain mitigating evidence was supported by the\n\ntrial court’s warning that it would allow the prosecution to put on the evidence if\n\n                                          -42-\n\fthe defense presented substantial evidence of the defendant’s nonviolent\n\ncharacter. See id. at 386. Rejecting the defendant’s ineffective-assistance-of-\n\ncounsel claim for failure to demonstrate prejudice, the Supreme Court held that in\n\nassessing prejudice a reviewing court must “consider all the relevant evidence\n\nthat the jury would have had before it if [the defendant] had pursued the different\n\npath—not just the mitigation evidence [the defendant] could have presented, but\n\nalso the [evidence of the other murder] that almost certainly would have come in\n\nwith it.” Id. Although some of the omitted mitigation evidence might have\n\nhelped the defendant, “the worst kind of bad evidence would have come in with\n\nthe good.” Id. at 390. Hence, the defendant had failed to show prejudice.\n\nFollowing the holding of Belmontes, we must consider not just the mitigation\n\nevidence that Defendant claims was wrongfully omitted, but also what the\n\nprosecution’s response to that evidence would have been.\n\n      In reviewing the district court’s conclusion that Defendant was not\n\nprejudiced by his counsel’s alleged deficiencies, “we accept the district court’s\n\nunderlying factual findings unless clearly erroneous, and we review de novo . . .\n\nwhether any deficiencies prejudiced the defendant.” United States v. Rodriguez-\n\nRivera, 518 F.3d 1208, 1216 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe court ruled that introduction of the additional mental-health evidence\n\nsubmitted by Defendant at the court’s hearing on remand might well have been a\n\ndouble-edged sword, “support[ing] the prosecution’s portrayal of [Defendant] as a\n\n                                        -43-\n\fdangerous and continuing threat to society.” Wilson V, 2011 WL 744661, at *26.\n\nBecause of the “distinct possibility that additional mental health evidence might\n\nhave been counterproductive and harmed Defendant’s mitigation case,” the\n\ndistrict court could not “conclude that additional evidence of [Defendant’s]\n\nmental health problems would have affected the jury’s imposition of the death\n\npenalty.” Id. We agree with the district court that Defendant has not shown that\n\ntrial counsel’s alleged deficiencies prejudiced him.\n\n             1.     The Failure to Call Additional Family Witnesses\n\n      We first address Defendant’s argument that the witnesses who provided\n\naffidavits for his appeal, including his sister, brother, and girlfriend, should have\n\nbeen called during the mitigation case and that their testimony may have\n\nconvinced jurors to vote against death.\n\n      We look to the posttrial affidavits as proffers of how these witnesses would\n\nhave testified. These affidavits assert that Defendant was affected by gang\n\nviolence from his youth, stating that he sustained a gunshot injury in a drive-by\n\nshooting; that he was frequently targeted by rival gang members, who shot at him,\n\nvandalized his car, and burned the house he shared with his mother; and that he\n\nwas attacked by gang members, including members of his own gang, while\n\nincarcerated. But the jury heard about the drive-by shooting and arson incident\n\nduring Dr. Reynolds’s testimony on Defendant’s social history. Although\n\nDr. Reynolds did not speak from first-hand knowledge about either incident,\n\n                                          -44-\n\fneither, so far as the record shows, could any of the omitted witnesses. The\n\nadditional matter would not have qualitatively altered the picture of Defendant’s\n\nexposure to violence and could have merely emphasized his gang involvement.\n\n      The omitted witnesses might also have testified to some of Defendant’s\n\nunusual behaviors and thought processes, which Dr. Reynolds thought indicative\n\nof a mental disorder. The value of this evidence, however, depends on the value\n\nof Dr. Reynolds’s use of it, a matter we address in the next section of this\n\nopinion. Suffice it to say now that Defendant gives no reason to suppose that the\n\nevidence would have been more effective if presented by the witnesses in person\n\n(and subject to cross-examination), rather than through Dr. Reynolds’s testimony.\n\n             2.    Deficiencies in Dr. Reynolds’s Trial Preparation and\n                   Testimony\n\n      Defendant’s chief argument regarding prejudice relates to Dr. Reynolds’s\n\ntestimony. According to Defendant, had Dr. Reynolds been given sufficient time\n\nand information to conduct all necessary interviews and psychological tests\n\nproperly, he would have arrived at his diagnosis of schizophrenic paranoid\n\npersonality disorder before trial and, if properly prepared by counsel, could have\n\npresented that diagnosis to the jury and explained how Defendant’s background\n\ncontributed to his mental illness, demonstrated that Defendant’s mental illness\n\naffected his behavior and caused him to have difficulty conforming his conduct to\n\nthe law, and helped the jury understand the motivation for Defendant’s actions,\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\fthereby calling into question Defendant’s moral culpability. Defendant contends\n\nthat conveying this information would have caused at least one juror to believe\n\nthat Defendant was not deserving of capital punishment. And he asserts that had\n\ncounsel performed properly, the prosecutor would not have been able to elicit\n\ntestimony from Dr. Reynolds that supported the prosecutor’s repeated\n\ncharacterizations of Defendant as a psychopath.\n\n      In evaluating these claims of prejudice, we look to the testimony at the\n\nevidentiary hearing, together with the exhibits offered in evidence at that hearing,\n\nto see what likely would been presented at trial if Defendant’s counsel had done\n\nwhat he contends they should have. Our review indicates that Defendant would\n\nhave been no better off with the evidence presented at the hearing, and in\n\nsignificant ways would have been worse off.\n\n      We start with the MMPI-2. Since his direct appeal, Defendant has laid\n\ngreat stress upon the failure to obtain a valid MMPI-2 before trial.\n\nDr. Reynolds’s affidavit submitted to the OCCA in support of an evidentiary\n\nhearing states: “There was some evidence for a diagnosis of schizophrenia but\n\nbecause his first MMPI-2 was invalid, I needed additional testing, and further\n\ncollateral data to support this diagnosis. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time\n\nto obtain this information before the trial.” R., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 845.\n\n      But the evidence from the hearing demonstrates that having Defendant\n\nretake the test did not help his case. The valid test contradicted more than it\n\n                                          -46-\n\fsupported Dr. Reynolds’s transition to a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenic\n\ndisorder. The interpretive report for the invalid test stated: “Many individuals\n\nwith this profile are considered to have severe Personality Disorders; however,\n\nthe possibility of Schizophrenia, Paranoid type, or of a Bipolar Affective\n\nDisorder should also be considered.” Id. at 912 (emphasis added). But the valid\n\ntest’s interpretive report said: “Individuals with this MMPI-2 clinical profile are\n\nusually diagnosed as having a Personality Disorder, Antisocial type.” Id. at 1017.\n\nIt did not suggest that schizophrenia be considered as a possible diagnosis.\n\n      Worse for Defendant, the interpretive report of the valid MMPI-2\n\nemphatically bolstered the prosecution’s position that Defendant was a continuing\n\nthreat to society. The invalid test’s interpretive report said that Defendant “fits\n\nequally well into more than one classification according to the Megargee\n\nclassification,” which was described as a “system for classifying male criminal\n\noffenders.” Id. at 912. The report did not say which classifications Defendant fit\n\nwithin, nor did it describe the characteristics of those classifications. The valid\n\ntest’s interpretive report, however, painted Defendant as being the most\n\ndespicable type of criminal. It said:\n\n      [Defendant’s] profile matches those of Type C offenders in the\n      Megargee typology. Individuals matching this profile type are\n      among the most difficult criminal offenders. They are often viewed\n      as distrustful, cold, irresponsible, and unstable. They tend to have\n      antisocial, aggressive, and hostile attitudes toward others. They\n      engage in violent crimes against other people and usually have an\n      extensive criminal record. They tend to come from deviant and\n\n                                         -47-\n\f      stressful home environments and typically have a great deal of\n      difficulty adjusting to society. They are viewed by others as\n      alienated, bitter, rigid, and dogmatic. Their interpersonal\n      relationships are quite disruptive; their suspicious attitudes and\n      deep-seated hostility toward others make them a difficult case for\n      rehabilitation. Research has supported the view that Type C inmates\n      typically have difficulty adjusting to prison life. It may be necessary\n      to segregate them from weaker or more vulnerable inmates during\n      incarceration.\n\nId. at 1017 (emphasis added). This is a roadmap for one seeking to portray\n\nDefendant as a dangerous criminal who could not safely be allowed to live.\n\n      When confronted at the evidentiary hearing with these statements\n\ncontradicting his diagnosis of Defendant, Dr. Reynolds stated that the test’s\n\nsuggested diagnoses merely provided “a hypothesis that you then correlate with\n\ncollateral data.” Id., Vol. 2 at 126. But the value of the collateral data on which\n\nhe relied—the statements by members of Defendant’s family and his girlfriend\n\nthat Dr. Reynolds found to be evidence of Defendant’s delusions and\n\nhallucinations—was undermined by the cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds at the\n\n§ 2254 evidentiary hearing. Indeed, Dr. Reynolds’s insistence that the statements\n\nprovided clear support for the diagnosis suggested sloppy analysis and bias,\n\nraising serious question about his credibility.\n\n      We note a few examples. First, as evidence of Defendant’s delusions,\n\nDr. Reynolds referred to the statement by Defendant’s sister that years earlier,\n\nwhen she and Defendant had attended the same school, Defendant had told school\n\nofficials that the two of them had different mothers and that his mother was\n\n                                         -48-\n\fwhite. But the statement was made when Defendant was “just a kid,” id., Vol. 1\n\npt. 5 at 864, and a later mental-health evaluation of Defendant administered by\n\nChildren’s Medical Center when he was 16 reported no delusions or\n\nhallucinations. After being confronted by this information on cross-examination,\n\nDr. Reynolds tried to explain away the mental-health evaluation during his\n\nredirect examination by noting that “usually the onset [of paranoid schizophrenia]\n\nis late teens to the early forties.” Id., Vol. 2 at 146. The explanation, however,\n\nmerely emphasizes the irrelevance of the “white mother” incident during\n\nDefendant’s childhood.\n\n      Second, Dr. Reynolds said that the presence of delusions and hallucinations\n\nwas supported by the untrue statement of Defendant to his girlfriend, Tonya Holt,\n\nthat his father was dead. Dr. Reynolds testified on cross-examination that he had\n\nno “possible nonpsychotic explanation” for Defendant’s statement, id. at 132,\n\neven after he had conceded that Defendant’s father was a man with drug and\n\nalcohol issues who was “pretty much” a non-entity in Defendant’s life, id. at 131,\n\nand the prosecutor had suggested that Defendant was simply embarrassed by his\n\nfather. Most remarkably, the very statement by Holt relied on by Dr. Reynolds\n\ncontinued: “[Defendant] never explained to me why he said his father was dead.\n\nI thought [Defendant] meant his father Oscar was not being a father.” Id., Vol. 1\n\npt. 5 at 854\n\n\n\n\n                                         -49-\n\f      Third, another statement from the Holt affidavit that Dr. Reynolds cited in\n\nsupport of the presence of delusions and hallucinations described Defendant’s\n\nhabit of sometimes introducing himself by a false name, Thomas, and adopting\n\ndifferent mannerisms. The prosecutor pointed out that Defendant had told police\n\n(in his murder confession) that he had used the name “Tommy” during the\n\nrobbery in order to conceal his identity. Id., Vol. 2 at 133. Dr. Reynolds did not\n\nrecall this information. He also apparently ignored Holt’s statement that “[she]\n\nalways thought it was strange [that Defendant used the name “Tom”], but [she]\n\nalso thought that he was just playing.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 855.\n\n      The best of this evidence of hallucinations was Holt’s statement that\n\nDefendant had told her that he heard voices. But even on this point Dr. Reynolds\n\nmisremembered facts that may have been relevant to his diagnosis. At the\n\nevidentiary hearing the prosecutor asked whether “[Defendant] state[d] you can\n\npray [the voices] away if you just pray hard enough, fight hard enough.” Id.,\n\nVol. 2 at 133. Dr. Reynolds responded: “Well, no, that’s not what he said. I\n\ndon’t think he said that you can pray them away or if you pray hard enough, but\n\nthat was an attempt which is very common for people with this disorder to make\n\nthese voice goes [sic] away.” Id. at 133–34. The prosecutor was not wrong.\n\nAccording to Holt, “[Defendant] told me, ‘I’ve heard them too, I hear voices & its\n\nOK. You just have to fight them, you just have to pray them away and they will\n\ngo away.’” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 856.\n\n                                         -50-\n\f      Another point on which Dr. Reynolds looked foolish was his finding that\n\nDefendant suffered from paranoia. He said in his affidavit: “[Defendant’s]\n\ndelusions appear to be of a grandiose and paranoid type. He believes . . . that he\n\nis being plotted against.” Id. at 848. But Defendant was a gang member, and a\n\nrival gang had shot him and set his mother’s home ablaze. Dr. Reynolds’s\n\nstruggle to construct a finding of delusional paranoia can be illustrated by the\n\nstatement in his affidavit that Defendant’s sister “described him as very\n\nsuspicious and paranoid,” id. at 847, when her full statement was:\n\n      I am familiar with the gang environment that [Defendant] grew up in\n      and I know it is no exaggeration to say that he was shot at on a daily\n      basis. I believe [Defendant] was being pulled into the gang scene by\n      at least his ninth grade year of high school. I remember [Defendant]\n      got real suspicious and paranoid after he joined the gang. He knew\n      it was a game of survival and he was always checking to see if\n      someone was in the house or near the car.\n\nId. at 865 (emphasis added).\n\n      In sum, Defendant has utterly failed to show that additional testing and\n\ninterviews would have produced a plausible diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenic\n\ndisorder. Nor has Defendant shown that better preparation of Dr. Reynolds could\n\nhave eliminated or weakened the prosecutor’s success at trial in characterizing\n\nDefendant as a psychopath. The term is used in the DSM-IV. It was even used\n\nby Dr. Reynolds in his draft affidavit for use in the appeal to the OCCA, before it\n\nwas deleted in the editing process. And little would have been gained by\n\nprohibiting use of the term because the description in the valid MMPI-2 of the\n\n                                         -51-\n\fDefendant’s profile—a Type C offender in the Megargee typology—explicitly\n\ndescribes the vision of evil evoked by the word psychopath.\n\n      Defendant’s evidence from the hearing also failed to establish any\n\nconnection between Dr. Reynolds’s diagnosis of Defendant and his commission of\n\nthe murder. Although Dr. Reynolds testified that knowing that Defendant\n\nsuffered from schizophrenic paranoid personality disorder might help a jury\n\nunderstand Defendant’s “motivation” for committing the crime, id., Vol. 2 at 72,\n\nthere was no credible evidence that Defendant acted as a result of delusions or\n\nhallucinations. Dr. Reynolds suggested in his affidavit: “It is possible that\n\n[Defendant] could have been delusional at the time of the crime; for example, he\n\nwent to his own place of employment knowing he would be observed by his co-\n\nworker, and customers. His thinking must have been delusional to believe that he\n\nwould not be easily identified.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 848. But this ignores the\n\nplanning for the crime, the efforts to allay any suspicion by customers who\n\nentered before the perpetrators could remove the safe, and the murder of the one\n\nwitness who had known Defendant previously.\n\n      Finally, insofar as Defendant contends that his counsel were ineffective in\n\nnot even presenting adequately what Dr. Reynolds had determined from the\n\ninformation obtained before his trial testimony, Defendant has not satisfied his\n\nburden of showing what more Dr. Reynolds could usefully have said. He argues\n\nthat the jury should have been presented “a complete picture of [Defendant’s]\n\n                                         -52-\n\fmental health,” Aplt. Br. at 40; but he does not describe what that picture was. At\n\nmost, from what we can tell from the record, Dr. Reynolds had several possible\n\ndiagnoses stated in the interpretive report on the valid MCMI-III test; but we have\n\nno way of assessing how that would have played out at trial, particularly when\n\nDr. Reynolds has never stated that he had adopted one of those diagnoses at the\n\ntime of his trial testimony. Defendant also states that Dr. Reynolds could have\n\ntestified at trial that those with mental disease “have less capability of controlling\n\ntheir behavior in regards to the law.” Id. at 38 (quoting R. Vol. 2 at 88). Such a\n\nvague, generalized statement, however, is not the sort of mental-health evidence\n\nthat courts rely on to show prejudice; indeed, this statement seems as probative of\n\nfuture dangerousness as of diminished moral culpability.\n\n      We are not denigrating the value of mental-health evidence to support\n\nmitigation in a capital case, nor are we departing from our precedent addressing\n\nsuch evidence. We do not dispute that mental retardation and organic brain\n\ndamage are well-recognized grounds for mitigation. See Hooks v. Workman, 689\n\nF.3d 1148, 1205 (10th Cir. 2012) (organic brain damage); Anderson v. Sirmons,\n\n476 F.3d 1131, 1144 (10th Cir. 2007) (brain damage) Smith v. Mullin, 379 F.3d\n\n919, 941–42 (10th Cir. 2004) (mental retardation and brain damage); see also\n\nAtkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 306 (2002) (prohibiting execution of the\n\nmentally retarded, partly because they “do not act with the level of moral\n\nculpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct”). And if\n\n                                         -53-\n\f(1) the record had supported a plausible diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and\n\n(2) Defendant’s behavior during the crime could have been tied to that disorder,\n\nthis would be a different case.\n\n       We conclude that Defendant has not satisfied his burden of showing that\n\nthe jury’s sentence of death “would reasonably likely have been different absent\n\nthe errors” of his counsel. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 696. Accordingly, we must\n\ndeny relief.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       We AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Defendant’s claims under § 2254.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\f11-5031, Wilson v. Workman\n\nGORSUCH, J., Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n         The court convincingly explains why, even viewed de novo, the evidence\n\nthat emerged during the district court’s evidentiary hearing doesn’t help Mr.\n\nWilson’s cause. I write only to add that the hearing wasn’t necessary in the first\n\nplace.\n\n         That, of course, was what the district court thought from the start. When\n\nthe case originally came to it, the district court held that the OCCA’s ruling on\n\nMr. Wilson’s state court Rule 3.11 motion amounted to an adjudication on the\n\nmerits of his Sixth Amendment claim, applied AEDPA deference, and held the\n\nOCCA’s decision neither an unreasonable adjudication of federal law nor based\n\non an unreasonable determination of the facts. See Wilson v. Sirmons, No. 00-\n\nCV-147CVEFHM, 2006 WL 2289777, at *41-43 (N.D. Okla. Aug. 8, 2006).\n\n         Then things took a turn. Years of wrangling on appeal intervened and at\n\nthe end of it all this court reversed, instructing the district court to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing and conduct a de novo review of Mr. Wilson’s claim. This\n\ncourt reasoned that the OCCA’s Rule 3.11 decision failed to constitute an\n\n“adjudication on the merits” of Mr. Wilson’s Sixth Amendment claim so the\n\ndistrict court could afford it no deference. Wilson v. Workman, 577 F.3d 1284,\n\n1290-93, 1299-1300 (10th Cir. 2009) (en banc). On remand, the district court\n\nproceeded to do as instructed, and did the job thoroughly and well. But this\n\nwhole process has turned out to be as needless as it was protracted. As our recent\n\fdecision in Lott v. Trammell, __ F.3d __, No. 11-6096, 2013 WL 142067, at *42-\n\n44 (10th Cir. Jan. 14, 2013), explains, Wilson no longer controls: intervening\n\nevents have undone the essential premises on which it rested.\n\n        Rule 3.11 requires the OCCA to decide whether a petitioner has shown a\n\n“strong possibility” his counsel was constitutionally ineffective. From this it\n\nseems plain enough that an adjudication of a Rule 3.11 motion necessarily\n\nadjudicates a Strickland claim on the merits entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2554(d). If anything, Oklahoma’s standard appears less demanding than\n\nStrickland, requiring the petitioner to show only a strong possibility of a\n\nconstitutional violation, not an actual constitutional violation. That, of course, is\n\nexactly what the district court held.\n\n        Wilson, however, decided otherwise. It ruled that the OCCA’s Rule 3.11\n\ndecisions don’t constitute “adjudications on the merits” of Strickland claims\n\nentitled to deference under AEDPA. They don’t, Wilson said, because — as a\n\nmatter of state law — the OCCA doesn’t have to consider evidence outside the\n\ntrial and direct appeal record developed collaterally by the petitioner. Put simply,\n\nthis court held that a ruling on such an “incomplete record” is not “an\n\nadjudication on the merits to which we owe any deference.” Wilson, 577 F.3d at\n\n1291.\n\n        Since then, however, the OCCA has explained that Wilson was mistaken in\n\nits understanding of Oklahoma law. In fact, Rule 3.11 “obligates” the OCCA in\n\n                                        -2-\n\fevery case to “thoroughly review and consider a defendant’s Rule 3.11\n\napplication and affidavits along with other attached non-record evidence.” Lott,\n\n2013 WL 142067, at *44 (alterations omitted) (quoting Simpson v. State, 230 P.3d\n\n888, 905 (Okla. Crim. App. 2010)). Thus, the essential premise on which Wilson\n\nstood has now evaporated. It turns out the OCCA does review all of a petitioner’s\n\nevidence, even evidence outside the trial and direct appeal record. Neither may\n\nwe ignore the OCCA’s interpretation of its own rule. After all, state courts, not\n\nwe, have the final say when it comes to explaining the meaning of state law. See\n\nLott, 2103 WL 142067, at *44.\n\n      Of course, while the petitioner in a state Rule 3.11 motion enjoys a lower\n\nstandard of proof than in a federal Strickland claim, he also faces what appears to\n\nbe a higher evidentiary burden. See Wilson, 577 F.3d at 1297. To win a Rule\n\n3.11 motion in state court, a petitioner must present “clear and convincing”\n\nevidence of a “strong possibility” of a Sixth Amendment violation: meanwhile, to\n\nwin a Strickland claim in federal court a petitioner must show an actual Sixth\n\nAmendment violation under a preponderance of the evidence standard. Despite\n\nthis difference in language, the State of Oklahoma argued in Wilson that, as a\n\nmatter of state law, Rule 3.11’s “clear and convincing” evidentiary standard is\n\nreally no more demanding than the federal “preponderance of the evidence”\n\nstandard. In support of its view, the State pointed to state case law indicating that\n\na Rule 3.11 petitioner’s evidentiary burden is modest, requiring only the\n\n                                         -3-\n\fpresentation of persuasive evidence, as opposed to “speculation, second guesses,\n\nor innuendo.” Id. at 1298 (quoting Jones v. State, 201 P.3d 869, 890 (Okla.\n\nCrim. App. 2009)); see also id. at 1306 (Tymkovich, J., dissenting) (offering this\n\nsame interpretation of state law). The Wilson court, however, rejected this\n\ninterpretation of state law. It read Rule 3.11 as imposing a more onerous\n\nevidentiary duty on litigants in state court than they would face in federal court\n\nand proceeded to question whether, in this light, a Rule 3.11 ruling could qualify\n\nas an adjudication on the merits of a Strickland claim entitled to AEDPA\n\ndeference. Id. at 1298-99.\n\n      Once again, however, the OCCA has since intervened. And once again it\n\nhas assured us that its evidentiary standard is “intended to be less demanding than\n\nthe test imposed by Strickland.” Lott, 2013 WL 142067, at *44 (quoting Simpson,\n\n230 P.3d at 906) (emphasis added). It has clarified that “when [it] review[s] and\n\nden[ies] a request for an evidentiary hearing on a claim of ineffective assistance\n\nunder the standard set forth in Rule 3.11, [it] necessarily make[s] the adjudication\n\nthat Appellant has not shown defense counsel to be ineffective under the more\n\nrigorous federal standard set forth in Strickland.” Id. (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting Simpson, 230 P.3d at 906). And, once again, the OCCA’s views of state\n\nlaw are controlling. Even if its interpretation doesn’t seem obvious to us, a state\n\ncourt is free to interpret its evidentiary rules as it wishes and free to interpret a\n\nstate “clear and convincing” standard as requiring no more proof than the federal\n\n                                          -4-\n\f“preponderance of the evidence” standard. Certainly the State of Oklahoma in\n\nWilson understood Rule 3.11’s evidentiary standard to require no more and after\n\nthe OCCA’s ruling in Simpson that understanding seems to stand confirmed. As\n\nLott has recognized, we must now accept “as a matter of federal law” that a Rule\n\n3.11 ruling “operates as an adjudication on the merits of the Strickland claim and\n\nis therefore entitled to deference under § 2254(d)(1).” Id.\n\n      Of course, if the OCCA should later rule in a way that suggests it is using a\n\nhigher evidentiary standard than Strickland employs we would have renewed\n\nquestions. In those circumstances, it seems to me the use of a higher evidentiary\n\nstandard than federal law prescribes could very well render the OCCA’s\n\nadjudication of a particular federal claim unreasonable — and so reversible —\n\nunder § 2254(d)(1). But while the OCCA’s choice of a different but conventional\n\nrule of evidence than federal courts use when ruling on a federal claim might\n\nexpose it to a greater chance of reversal when the case comes to federal court, it\n\nis less clear to me whether that might render the state court’s final decision on the\n\nclaim something entirely alien, something other than an adjudication on the\n\nmerits of the claim entitled to deference in the first instance.\n\n      Happily, though, none of these potential problems appears to be live ones\n\ntoday. For now, the essential state law premises on which Wilson rested no\n\nlonger appear operative, having been superseded by the OCCA’s definitive\n\nexposition of the meaning of its own rule. Accordingly and as Lott has held, we\n\n                                          -5-\n\fowe AEDPA deference to the OCCA’s adjudication of Rule 3.11 motions. Seven\n\nyears ago the district court concluded as much and explained in great detail why\n\nthe OCCA’s decision in this particular case did not offend § 2254(d). See Wilson,\n\n2006 WL 2289777, at *41-43. The many years and rounds of additional process\n\nbetween there and here only serve to that court’s prescience.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f",

See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253(c)(1)(A) (requiring a COA to appeal the denial of a § 2254 application).\n\n           We affirm the denial of Defendant’s habeas application. In light of the\n\nevidence presented at the hearing before the district court, he has not shown that\n\nhe was prejudiced by the alleged deficiencies in his counsel’s performance at\n\ntrial. 2\n\nI.         BACKGROUND\n\n           A.    The Murder\n\n           In 1995 Defendant worked at a QuikTrip convenience store in Tulsa,\n\nOklahoma. He, along with accomplices Billy Alverson, Darwin Brown, and\n\nRichard Harjo, planned to rob the store. In the early morning hours of\n\nFebruary 26, 1995 (two days before Defendant’s 20th birthday), the four men\n\nentered the QuikTrip, loitering for about an hour while Defendant conversed with\n\nthe victim, Richard Yost, the employee on duty. In one chilling exchange,\n\nDefendant, just 14 minutes before the assault began, asked Yost how long he\n\nplanned to work at QuikTrip. When Yost answered that he hoped to become store\n\nmanager someday, Defendant responded “For real?” R., Vol. 3 Tr. Feb. 20, 1997,\n\nat 29–30. The conversation and other events in the store were captured on the\n\n\n           2\n       We thank counsel for both Defendant and the State for their skillful\nadvocacy in this appeal.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fstore’s surveillance-camera recording, obtained by law-enforcement officers from\n\nAlverson’s home.\n\n       While Yost was cleaning the store’s coolers, the four men attacked him and\n\ndragged him into a back room. Alverson and Harjo briefly left the store while\n\nYost screamed for help. The two men returned with a black aluminum baseball\n\nbat and went to the back room, where the robbers beat Yost to death with the bat.\n\nYost was handcuffed during the beating: a piece of handcuff later recovered from\n\nhis skull indicated that he was conscious and attempting to ward off blows for at\n\nleast part of the fatal attack.\n\n       During the beating Defendant left the back room, donned a QuikTrip jacket,\n\nand began attempting to remove the store’s safe from its position under the\n\ncounter. As customers entered the store, Defendant greeted them, rang up their\n\ntransactions, and wished them a good day. After dislodging the safe, Defendant\n\nand his three accomplices fled the store with the safe, the contents of the cash\n\ndrawer, and the surveillance video. Yost’s body, lying in a pool of blood, milk,\n\nand beer, was discovered by a customer within a few hours.\n\n       All four culprits were arrested later that day. Under police interrogation\n\nDefendant confessed to participating in the crime. He stated that the robbery and\n\nYost’s killing had been planned for two weeks. Corroborating this admission was\n\nevidence that the body alarm typically worn by QuikTrip employees on overnight\n\nshifts had been found missing from the store the week before the murder. The\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsafe, the surveillance tape, and several other items from the QuikTrip were\n\nrecovered from Alverson’s home.\n\n      B.    The Penalty Phase at Trial\n\n      Evidence was presented during the guilt phase of Defendant’s trial on\n\nFebruary 11, 12, and 13, 1997. He did not present any evidence other than the\n\ntape-recorded statement of codefendant Brown. Given the irrefutable evidence of\n\nguilt, the penalty phase, which began on February 18, was the true contest.\n\n            1.     The State’s Case\n\n      The State alleged three aggravating factors to justify the death penalty: (1)\n\nthat the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing arrest or\n\nprosecution, (2) that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and\n\n(3) that Defendant was a continuing threat to society because of the probability\n\nthat he would commit future crimes of violence. See Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 701.12\n\n(2011). The first aggravator—murder to avoid arrest or prosecution—was\n\nobvious from the evidence at the guilt stage of trial. For the other aggravators,\n\nthe State offered additional evidence.\n\n      To support the second aggravator, a forensic pathologist testified that in his\n\nopinion Yost would have suffered during the attack unless he had been rendered\n\nimmediately unconscious, and he described Yost’s injuries, including wounds to\n\nYost’s hand and scalp, that indicated his efforts to defend himself. See\n\nWillingham v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195106\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195106/willingham-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997) (For a jury to\n\n                                         -5-\n\ffind that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, “the State must prove\n\nconscious serious physical abuse or torture prior to death.”).\n\n      To prove the continuing-threat aggravator, the State called police witnesses\n\nwho testified about two recent offenses. First, Defendant had been convicted as\n\nan accessory after the fact to the murder of a woman in September 1994 (five\n\nmonths before the Yost murder). The conviction was based on his taking\n\npossession of a gun at the principal’s request, although, as noted by the OCCA,\n\n“the facts revealed that he may have been more involved in this drive-by shooting\n\nby providing ammunition for the gun on the day of the murder.” Wilson I, 983\n\nP.2d at 466. Second, 10 days before Yost’s murder, police had seized a loaded\n\nrevolver from Defendant’s car during a traffic stop. Codefendant Brown was also\n\nin the car. On cross-examination Defendant’s counsel pointed out that Brown was\n\nthe one charged with possession of the gun and suggested that Defendant was not\n\naware of the gun’s presence.\n\n      The State also presented victim-impact statements from Yost’s wife and\n\nmother, both of whom testified to how their lives had been tragically affected by\n\nYost’s murder.\n\n             2.    The Defense Mitigation Case\n\n                   a.     The Lay Witnesses\n\n      In the mitigation case the defense put on five lay witnesses and one expert.\n\nTwo of Defendant’s former teachers and two fellow church members offered\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsimilar testimony: that they had known Defendant as a polite, respectful, well-\n\nbehaved, and intelligent young man and that the murder for which he had been\n\nconvicted did not represent “the Mike Wilson [they] knew.” R., Vol. 3 Tr.\n\nFeb. 19, 1997, at 11. On cross-examination the prosecutor elicited that three of\n\nthe witnesses had last seen Defendant between two and five years earlier and that\n\nhis criminal conduct suggested that his behavior and character might have\n\nchanged in the interim.\n\n      The other lay witness was Defendant’s mother, Patricia Taylor. She\n\ntestified that his father frequently used crack cocaine, was often absent, and was\n\nnot a positive influence on Defendant’s life; that she had cultivated a loving\n\nrelationship with Defendant and had attempted to inculcate positive values in him;\n\nand that she had visited Defendant in jail almost every week. She also testified\n\nthat she turned over to police some physical evidence of the murder, including the\n\nmurder weapon, explaining that she had acted to follow “the rules,” and that she\n\nexpected that doing so would help her son in the long run. Id. at 99. She further\n\ntestified that immediately after the murder (but before his apprehension),\n\nDefendant had returned home in a disturbed emotional state. He said that a man\n\nhad been killed in a robbery at the QuikTrip, although he did not know how it\n\nhappened. They then prayed together about the crime. Ms. Taylor concluded\n\nwith a plea for her son’s life.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f                    b.     Dr. Reynolds\n\n      Defendant’s expert witness was Dr. Allan Eugene Reynolds, a clinical\n\npsychologist. On direct examination Dr. Reynolds testified to some aspects of his\n\npretrial preparation, stating that he had reviewed information about Defendant’s\n\nbackground, including his school, medical, and criminal records; that he had\n\ninterviewed Defendant’s mother; and that he had reviewed statements by lay\n\nwitnesses. In addition, he had met with Defendant on three occasions at the Tulsa\n\nCounty Jail, and had administered several psychological tests to Defendant: the\n\nSlossen Intelligence test; two tests designed to screen for organic brain damage,\n\nthe Bender Gestalt test and the Memory for Designs test; and two personality\n\ntests, the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III. Defendant also completed a psychosocial\n\nquestionnaire, and Dr. Reynolds observed and interviewed Defendant in addition\n\nto the formal testing.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds was not asked about a failure in the testing. He had\n\nadministered the MMPI-2 on February 6, 1997, and sent the responses to be\n\nscored by computer. The PhD psychologist who scored the test reported that the\n\ntest was probably invalid, and Dr. Reynolds informed Defendant’s counsel of the\n\ninvalidity by February 10, the day before trial testimony commenced. But no\n\nretest was administered.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds testified to the results of the valid tests. He reported\n\nDefendant’s IQ as 126, placing him in the “superior” range of intelligence. Id. at\n\n                                          -8-\n\f55. He said that there was no indication of organic brain dysfunction but that the\n\npersonality tests showed that Defendant suffered from a “severe personality\n\ndisturbance.” Id. at 57. He explained:\n\n       [T]here were responses and there were scores that indicate that\n       [Defendant] has some very unusual, bizarre types of thinking. That\n       would suggest that at times he’s not or has not periodically been in\n       touch with reality. That he basically does not necessarily function at\n       times in a normal state, but that he has a great deal of emotional\n       pathology.\n\nId. Dr. Reynolds also said that in reviewing the statements of those who knew\n\nDefendant and in observing Defendant himself, he found it “remarkable” that\n\n       no one seemed to have any indication that he would engage in the\n       types of behavior that he did.\n\n       And then on the other hand, the psychological tests show that he has\n       that propensity to engage in that type of behavior. And so there’s a\n       big conflict in terms of what people observed of him and maybe what\n       was going on inside of him.\n\nId. at 58.\n\n       When asked if his psychological analysis could explain “the two Michael\n\nWilsons,” Dr. Reynolds spoke of the differences between Defendant’s two\n\nparents. Id. at 59. He said:\n\n              Well, the social history questionnaire indicates that—and his—\n       his past that he grew up in a family where the father left, who was\n       involved in drugs and alcohol, and pretty much was not involved in\n       Michael’s life.\n              The mother was very strong, caring, disciplinarian and tried to\n       keep the family together. Michael was involved in church. And\n       then, I believe one of the persons that he identified with very closely,\n       a Sunday school teacher, died of cancer. From my interviews with\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      him, he indicated to me that this was very distressing and very\n      upsetting to him.\n             There was a lot of gang activity in the neighborhood where he\n      grew up. The mother sent him off to North Carolina for a while with\n      her sister. And Mike did very well out there in a different\n      environment.\n             So on the one hand, here’s a young man who has an\n      uninvolved father, who’s a role model, was involved in drugs and\n      alcohol, and not particularly caring. And on the other hand, you\n      have a highly structured mother, who provides church and this sort of\n      thing.\n             So you have the two pictures of Mike. On the one hand, you\n      have the picture of the Sunday school-going child. On the other\n      hand, you have the picture of the gang and uninvolved father, who\n      did not set a particularly good role model.\n             When he got out of both of those environments and went off to\n      North Carolina, apparently there he did very well. I believe that his\n      sister and his brother-in-law were involved in the Marines, provided\n      a lot of structure for him.\n             So if we look at the environments to which he was exposed to\n      does explain somewhat of the two type of Michael’s [sic] that you\n      have, depending where he was at as to who he identified with.\n\nId. at 59–61.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds testified about the gang violence to which Defendant had\n\nbeen exposed from a young age. He identified several particularly traumatic\n\nexperiences: Defendant’s being shot in a drive-by attack when a young\n\nadolescent, the torching of his home by rival gang members, and the death of his\n\nSunday-school teacher from cancer.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds also suggested that Defendant could be rehabilitated because\n\nof his superior intelligence. He explained:\n\n      [Defendant’s high level of intelligence] provides him, I think, with\n      the intelligence to do something with himself, as well as be a\n\n                                        -10-\n\f       contributor to others in terms of understanding his world,\n       understanding what he’s done, what other persons have done. And\n       therefore, with this level of intelligence, he has the ability to make\n       contributions that may be helpful to those who have lesser\n       intelligence.\n\nId. at 63.\n\n       The prosecutor’s cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds elicited a much more\n\ndisturbing picture of Defendant. It began with the suggestion that Defendant’s\n\npersonality disturbance was that of a psychopath:\n\n       Q: Doctor, in your experience are there psychopathic criminals who\n       have superior intelligence?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Makes them all the better, doesn’t it?\n\n       A: It can.\n\n       Q: You referenced a severe personality disturbance and mental\n       disorder, I believe you testified?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Doesn’t that mean he’s a psychopath?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: It doesn’t?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: The sharp contrast he exhibits that you testified to, aren’t those\n       the classic designs of a psychopath? “Yes” or “no”?\n\n       A: It can be.\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f      Q: And aren’t psychopaths the most likely to re-offend, based on the\n      studies?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\nId. at 65. Later, Dr. Reynolds agreed that “a 19-year-old with superior\n\nintelligence know[s] right from wrong.” Id. at 66.\n\n       The prosecutor used published studies to attack the validity of the\n\nintelligence and personality tests employed by Dr. Reynolds. But he also elicited\n\nsome of their conclusions. Dr. Reynolds conceded that the MCMI-III interpretive\n\nreport stated that “[t]he guiding principle of [Defendant] is to outwit others,\n\nexerting power over them before they can exploit him,” id. at 69 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), and that Defendant was “easily provoked” and “may\n\nexpress sudden and unanticipated brutality,” id. at 70 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). He also acknowledged that Defendant had responded “True” to the\n\nfollowing statements on the test questionnaire: “Lately, I have begun to feel like\n\nsmashing things”; “I often get angry with people who do things slowly”; “I have\n\nhad to be really rough with some people to keep them in line”; and “I sometimes\n\nfeel crazy-like or unreal when things start to go badly in my life.” Id. at 70–71\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Later in the cross-examination the prosecutor returned to the psychopath\n\ntheme, referring to Dr. Reynolds’s prior testimony about the sharp contrast\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fbetween Defendant’s behavior before family and friends and his violent criminal\n\nconduct:\n\n       Q: [I]sn’t this consistent with the characteristics of a psychopath?\n\n       A: As I stated before, it can be.\n\n       Q: Well, aren’t superficial charm and good intelligence, coupled\n       with cunning and manipulative lack of implusivity [sic] behavior\n       characteristics of a psychopath?\n\n       A: Yes, they are.\n\n       Q: And that’s what Mr. Wilson has, isn’t it?\n\n       A: Some of those characteristics, he has.\n\n       Q: And you told this jury that psychopaths are the most likely to re-\n       offend based on the studies?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\nId. at 76.\n\n       Dr. Reynolds acknowledged that he did not know what mental-health\n\ntreatment options would be available to Defendant in prison, and he agreed that\n\nwithout treatment, Defendant would represent a continuing threat to others.\n\nDr. Reynolds also conceded that past violent behavior is the best predictor of\n\nfuture violence.\n\n       On redirect examination Dr. Reynolds defended his use of the\n\npsychological instruments challenged by the prosecutor. He also expanded on the\n\nsignificance of Defendant’s answer on the MCMI-III that he felt “crazy-like”:\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f      Q: What things were you referring to, sir, whenever you told us\n      there were evidences of severe mental disorder in this person?\n\n      A: Well, I think probably the most classic example would be in the\n      Noteworthy Responses when [the prosecutor] asked me to read one\n      of the questions, which “Sometimes I feel crazy-like or unreal when\n      things start to go badly in my life,” he answers true.\n\nId. at 82. Dr. Reynolds went on to note that “[u]sually, unless someone’s pretty\n\ndisturbed, they’re not going to answer that true, they’re going to answer that\n\nfalse.” Id.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds further testified that the tests were mere components of his\n\noverall evaluation of Defendant, to be interpreted in light of clinical experience,\n\ninterviews, observations, and Defendant’s social history. He stated that\n\nDefendant’s mental disorders were treatable, reiterated his opinion that\n\nDefendant’s high intelligence made him a good prospect for rehabilitation, and\n\nagreed that in light of Defendant’s upstanding behavior in school and church, a\n\nstructured setting such as prison might have a positive influence on Defendant’s\n\nconduct and mental state.\n\n      During closing argument the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the cross-\n\nexamination of Dr. Reynolds, describing Defendant as a “psychopath” and a\n\n“psychopathic killer.” Id., Tr. Feb. 20, 1997, at 46. The defense attorneys had\n\nlittle to counter the argument. They did not discuss Defendant’s mental disorder\n\nduring closing, except to suggest that the “psychopath” label obscured\n\nDefendant’s humanity and positive characteristics. Their main themes in closing\n\n                                         -14-\n\fwere that there was no evidence proving that Defendant personally participated in\n\nthe beating of Yost, and that Defendant could reform his life and be of benefit to\n\nothers if allowed to live.\n\n      The jury found all three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt and sentenced Defendant to death.\n\n      C.     The § 2254 Evidentiary Hearing\n\n      From the time of his original appeal to the OCCA to the present, Defendant\n\nhas contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during the\n\npenalty phase of his trial. Adopting the language of a member of this court,\n\nDefendant has referred to the cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds as a “‘train\n\nwreck.’” E.g., Aplt. Br. at 11 (quoting Wilson III, 536 F.3d at 1076 (McConnell,\n\nJ.)). He attributes Dr. Reynolds’s poor performance to tardy and inadequate\n\npreparation by defense counsel. He emphasizes that counsel did not retain\n\nDr. Reynolds until shortly before trial and failed to arrange for Defendant to\n\nretake the MMPI-2 personality test when the initial results turned out to be\n\ninvalid. He contends that trial counsel also failed to conduct adequate interviews\n\nof family members that would have enabled Dr. Reynolds to arrive at a diagnosis\n\nthat could have changed the jury’s decision to impose the death penalty.\n\n      To give Defendant an opportunity to show the inadequacy of his counsel’s\n\nperformance and what could have been accomplished through the additional steps\n\nthat he believes counsel should have taken, this court ordered the district court to\n\n                                        -15-\n\fconduct an evidentiary hearing. See Wilson III, 536 F.3d at 1096. The hearing\n\nwas held on July 28, 2010. Testifying were Dr. Reynolds; Defendant’s lead trial\n\ncounsel, Joe Paul Robertson, who was director of the Oklahoma Indigent Defense\n\nSystem at the time of the hearing; and Defendant’s second-chair trial counsel,\n\nKent Hudson. For our purposes, we need focus only on Dr. Reynolds’s\n\ntestimony. 3\n\n               1.   Dr. Reynolds’s Testimony on Direct\n\n      The thrust of Dr. Reynolds’s direct examination was to show that if defense\n\ncounsel had asked him to do before trial what he did only after the jury had\n\nsentenced Defendant to death, he could have arrived at a diagnosis of mental\n\ndisease that would have explained Defendant’s evil misconduct in a way that\n\nwould generate sympathy from the jury. Dr. Reynolds was purportedly able to\n\narrive at that diagnosis—schizophrenic paranoid personality disorder or paranoid\n\nschizophrenic disorder—because he now had a valid MMPI test and had\n\ninterviews (of Defendant’s family and girlfriend) establishing the delusions and\n\n\n      3\n         Mr. Robertson had little specific recollection of his representation of\nDefendant. He did not recall being told by Dr. Reynolds that more time was\nneeded to test Defendant, or that the results of the MMPI-2 personality test were\ninvalid. He suggested that the late hiring of Dr. Reynolds was due to budgetary\nconstraints and to a desire not to turn over Dr. Reynolds’s raw data to the State\nuntil absolutely necessary.\n       Mr. Hudson testified that he did not recall any coordination of strategy\nbetween the lay witnesses (whom he handled) and the expert testimony. He also\ntestified that during his many interactions with Defendant, he had never noticed\nany signs or symptoms of mental illness.\n\n                                       -16-\n\fhallucinations necessary for the diagnosis. The new diagnosis would also have\n\nenabled him to fend off suggestions by the prosecutor that Defendant is a\n\npsychopath.\n\n      Defense counsel began by marching Dr. Reynolds through his pretrial\n\npreparation and his meetings with Defendant. In answer to a question by the\n\ncourt, he then explained the meaning of the invalidity of the MMPI-2 test:\n\n      [W]hen the individual takes the test in a manner that shows that there\n      may be a variety of reasons that would not allow the test results to be\n      used simply because he answered and his responses were in such a\n      way, that, let’s say, for example, maybe he had a low reading level,\n      he was confused, or he tried to manipulate the test, or let’s say he\n      was inconsistent with his answers.\n\nR., Vol. 2 at 62. Even though the test was invalid, Dr. Reynolds thought that the\n\nresults “indicated that there was a severe disturbance,” id. at 63, and he felt that\n\nhe needed more information to determine what was going on. (The computer-\n\nscored report on the test said, “Many individuals with this profile are considered\n\nto have severe Personality Disorders; however, the possibility of Schizophrenia,\n\nParanoid type, or of a Bipolar Affective Disorder should also be considered.” Id.,\n\nVol. 1 pt. 5 at 912. And the report’s section on “Symptomatic Patterns” said that\n\nDefendant “endorsed a number of extreme and bizarre thoughts, suggesting the\n\npresence of delusions and/or hallucinations.” Id. at 910.) Dr. Reynolds thought\n\nthat he would have told defense counsel “that the test was invalid, we can’t use\n\nthis information, but there is further information here that is important and that is\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fnot totally supported by the MCMI but there’s a need to really know more.” Id.,\n\nVol. 2 at 65. 4 He explained:\n\n      The MCMI really never reported the auditory hallucinations, okay?\n      But where I began to get a tie between the two was the MCMI talked\n      about the paranoid personality. Then I hear the MMPI, the way he\n      answered those questions, talking about voices, et cetera, et cetera, et\n      cetera, and then that began to give me information that there’s\n      something more here that I need to investigate.\n\nId. He said that if he had had more time he “would have redone the MMPI again\n\nand probably given him instructions in terms of how, if he didn’t understand a\n\nquestion, or if he was unable to comprehend what it was asking, to make a note of\n\nit and I would assist him with it so that he would be able to give a more valid\n\nresult.” Id. at 67. He added that he had now done those things.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds then testified about the valid pretrial MCMI-III test. The\n\nresults indicated “that there was a severe personality disturbance, and that the test\n\ngave a variety of diagnoses that could be considered.” Id. at 68. These included\n\nnarcissistic personality disorder with passive-aggressive personality traits,\n\nschizotypal personality features, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder,\n\nposttraumatic stress disorder, and paranoid personality disorder. 5\n\n      4\n         Dr. Reynolds believed that he had said this to defense counsel during a\nmeeting on February 17; but it appears that he probably conveyed this information\nat least a week earlier, because defense counsel informed the court on\nFebruary 10 (the day before trial testimony began) that the test was unreliable.\n      5\n        Dr. Reynolds later described these disorders as follows: A person with a\nnarcissistic personality disorder believes the world revolves around him and may\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                        -18-\n\f      As for the disorder he now diagnosed Defendant as having—schizophrenic\n\nparanoid personality disorder—Dr. Reynolds explained that “it would have to\n\nhave with it auditory hallucinations, and that’s where they’re hearing things,\n\nthey’re hearing things to be told to do, or they’re hearing things, for example, that\n\nthey’re a special person, or maybe there’s evil spirits.” Id. at 78–79. He said that\n\npeople with the disorder “have the paranoid ideas that people are out to get them,\n\nthat they don’t really trust people, that they’re suspicious of others, and he met\n\nthat diagnosis.” Id. at 79. But, he added, people with the disorder can function in\n\nsociety:\n\n      [E]verybody kind of thinks of schizophrenia as somebody who is\n      dysfunctional, completely can’t talk straight, or anything like that.\n      But on the paranoid—schizophrenic paranoid personality disorder,\n      the person still appears quite able to function, and Mr. Wilson did, so\n      he met that criteria as well. It was the combination of his paranoid\n      ideas, the delusions, and the auditory hallucinations that fit that\n      diagnosis.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n      5\n          (...continued)\nexploit others; a passive-aggressive personality trait manifests by redirecting\nhostile or angry feelings from their source to another person or object; persons\nwith schizotypal personality features are not really schizophrenic but are socially\nawkward and tend to withdraw from interactions with others; generalized anxiety\ndisorder involves physiological and psychological symptoms of anxiety\nunconnected to any obvious stressor; bipolar disorder is characterized by mood\nswings, sometimes dramatic, with the subject cycling from manic energy and\ncarefreeness to deep depression; and posttraumatic stress disorder involves\nhypervigilance, depression, or irritability after exposure to a dangerous situation.\nSee R., Vol. 2 at 82, 83, 84, 86, 87.\n\n                                         -19-\n\f      Explaining how he arrived at his diagnosis, Dr. Reynolds testified that the\n\nstatements by lay persons were critical:\n\n      [W]hat clued me in is when he indicated to me about the voices, but\n      when I then got collaborative [sic] information that verified that from\n      the girlfriend, his brother, and some sense of it from his mother, that\n      somehow solidified my essence that now I felt more on the right\n      track, but that’s not what I had before.\n\nId. at 71–72.\n\n      In response to the court’s question about how the diagnosis would have\n\naffected the jury, Dr. Reynolds said that the mental illness could explain\n\nDefendant’s motivations:\n\n             Well, I don’t know how a jury thinks, but I think it may have\n      helped them understand that the motivation for what he did, once\n      they knew about the delusions, once they knew about the voices, and\n      once they knew about his mental illness, would have helped them\n      know a little bit more that maybe he was influenced by his mental\n      illness as averse to being just a raw, bad guy that’s just out there for\n      the fun of it, but that the mental illness had some impact as opposed\n      to being a normal guy that just goes out there and does something\n      heinous, as he did. So I think it had to do with them and it would\n      depend on what their opinion of mental illness is. So I think just\n      knowing that the motivation may have been driven somewhat by his\n      mental illness as opposed to not having that disorder.\n\nId. at 72. Defense counsel later pursued the matter further, asking what was “the\n\nmost crucial information” about Defendant that Dr. Reynolds could have given\n\nthe jury but did not. Id. at 89. Dr. Reynolds replied, “I think the discussion of\n\nhis mental disorders,” and went on to assert that this information “was crucial in\n\nallowing the jury to know every aspect of Mr. Wilson in this part of the trial, to\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fbe able to understand him, possibly understand some of his motivations,\n\nunderstand his behavior, and that his behavior may have had something to do with\n\nhis mental illness.” Id. Dr. Reynolds said that the schizophrenia diagnosis would\n\nhave presented “a different picture” of Defendant had it been available at trial.\n\nId. at 109. He explained that “my part of the trial, it was basically his\n\nintelligence and that he was disturbed. And the picture that we have now is\n\nsomeone who is very seriously disturbed with a psychiatric diagnostic disorder\n\nthat is very, very severe.” Id. He stated that the posttrial diagnosis “superseded\n\nthe antisocial diagnosis,” id. at 96, “simply because of the delusions, the auditory\n\nhallucinations, and the test data.” Id.\n\n      Dr. Reynolds also testified that he could have corrected the prosecutor’s\n\nuse of the term psychopath if he had been properly questioned on redirect\n\nexamination:\n\n      Q: Do you believe that Mr. Wilson’s attorney allowed you to explain\n      the term “psychopath”?\n\n      A: No, he did not.\n\n      Q: Okay. Could you explain the term “psychopath” to the jury had\n      you been asked?\n\n      A: Yeah. Yes.\n\n      Q: What is the meaning of a psychopath?\n\n      A: Well, there is no meaning because it doesn’t exist.\n\n      Q: [W]ell, is it outdated, that it used to exist?\n\n                                          -21-\n\f      A: It’s outdated, yes.\n\n      Q: Okay. Whether it doesn’t exist now or is outdated or not, does\n      that term carry a stigma?\n\n      A: Probably to the lay persons it does, yes.\n\n      Q: And what would that stigma be?\n\n      A: Well, I guess I’ll just put it very simply, in that this is a very\n      dangerous, bad person who has no regard for life of others.\n\n      Q: Did you feel the jury was left with an inaccurate depiction of\n      Mr. Wilson?\n\n      A: Well, I think they got part of Mr. Wilson, but I don’t think they\n      got more of what was there, but I can’t say that it was inaccurate.\n      [I]f the part maybe you’re referring to is being defined as a\n      psychopath, that was inaccurate. But they did get other parts of him.\n\n      Q: Is being depicted as a psychopath harmful?\n\n      A: Certainly, yes.\n\nId. at 91–92.\n\n                2.   Cross-Examination of Dr. Reynolds\n\n      The prosecutor’s cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds at the evidentiary\n\nhearing was, if anything, more devastating to Defendant’s case than the trial\n\ncross-examination of Dr. Reynolds had been. Rather than reporting the cross-\n\nexamination in chronological order, we organize it by subject matter.\n\n                     a.    Use of the Term Psychopath\n\n      The prosecutor began by pointing out that the term psychopath was not as\n\nclinically inappropriate or outdated as Dr. Reynolds had suggested. He noted that\n\n                                         -22-\n\fthe American Psychiatric Association’s widely used and authoritative Diagnostic\n\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. Text Revision 2000)\n\n(DSM-IV-TR), itself says that the term has been used as another name for\n\nantisocial personality disorder. Indeed, Dr. Reynolds himself had used the term\n\nshortly after the trial. The affidavit that he drafted for Defendant’s state-court\n\nappeal stated that “psychopath is a term associated with antisocial personality\n\ndisorder.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 1011. (The statement was deleted from the affidavit\n\nfiled with the OCCA.) Dr. Reynolds responded that it would nevertheless be\n\nincorrect to use the term because “it’s not a DSM-IV diagnosis any longer,” id.,\n\nVol. 2 at 114, and, in any event, as his affidavit quoted the DSM-IV, “‘Antisocial\n\nbehavior that occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or a manic\n\nepisode should not be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder’ or\n\npsychopathic personality.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 1011.\n\n                    b.    Effect of Mental Disorder on Defendant’s\n                          Participation in the Murder\n\n      The prosecutor challenged whether Dr. Reynolds’s diagnosis of Defendant,\n\neven if correct, could help explain his behavior at the QuikTrip:\n\n      Q: Doctor, I believe you mentioned on direct examination that you\n      believe your diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia may have helped\n      the jury understand Mr. Wilson’s motivation for what he did. Is that\n      what you testified to?\n\n      A: Something to that effect.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fQ: And, Doctor, you’ve reviewed the surveillance tape from the\nQuik Trip depicting Mr. Wilson’s actions during the commission of\nthe murder; correct?\n\nA: I have.\n\nQ: All right. And will you agree, sir, that that videotape depicts a\nnumber of logical, goal-oriented behaviors on Mr. Wilson’s behalf?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: So there’s no question that when he goes from the cooler, after\nMr. Yost has been herded in there by Mr. Wilson and his\naccomplices, Mr. Wilson goes to the front checkout stand and\nassumes the role of clerk; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Logical, goal-oriented behavior?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. And when Mr. Wilson is conversing with the individuals,\nthe various customers who came into the Quik Trip store that early\nmorning time period, did he seem to have any trouble conversing\nwith them, sir?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: The tape you had had the audio portion of it; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: He’s able to strike up conversations; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: He’s able to help these individuals find whatever it was they\nsupposedly were looking for; right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n                                 -24-\n\f      Q: Okay. And he was able to help move them along and get them on\n      out; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And that’s logical, goal-oriented behavior under the\n      circumstances; would you agree?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And the same is true with Mr. Wilson removing the safe from the\n      cabinet; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And I could go on and on. Doctor, that’s a pretty good\n      indication, is it not, of what Mr. Wilson was motivated to do there;\n      right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 127–29.\n\n                   c.      Consistency of Dr. Reynolds’s Diagnosis with the\n                           Test Results\n\n      The prosecutor also challenged Dr. Reynolds’s posttrial diagnosis. He first\n\nquestioned whether it was consistent with the pretrial MCMI-III, which was valid:\n\n      Q: [I]sn’t it true the MCMI-III has several clinical scales that\n      measures for the sort of thought disorders and delusional disorders\n      that would be relevant to a diagnosis of schizophrenia?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: [D]espite that, the MCMI-III did not suggest, as a likely\n      diagnosis, paranoid schizophrenia, did it?\n\n      A: That’s correct.\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f      Q: A diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder suggests the absence\n      of paranoid schizophrenia; is that correct?\n\n\n      A: Well, it would be only the absence of the hallucinations and\n      delusions.\n\nId. at 123.\n\n      The prosecutor then asked about the consistency of the diagnosis with the\n\nvalid posttrial MMPI-2:\n\n      Q: [U]nder “Diagnostic Considerations,” where the report states,\n      “Individuals with this MMPI-2 clinical profile are usually diagnosed\n      as having a personality disorder, antisocial type.”\n\n      A: Uh-huh.\n\n      Q: Okay. And it goes on to say a lot of other things; right?\n\n      A: Correct.\n\n      Q: Basically bolstering the antisocial features of Mr. Wilson’s\n      personality; is that fair to say?\n\n      A: Well, again, you have to understand that this is a hypothesis that\n      you then correlate with collateral data. So the collateral data then\n      supported the bizarre, unusual thinking, things—and it said that I\n      need to take those into consideration, which I did, and therefore, as a\n      clinician, I felt the diagnosis was more clearly of the paranoid\n      schizophrenic than it was the antisocial. As I explained before, there\n      are antisocial characteristics here, for sure.\n\nId. at 126–127 (emphasis added). (The record shows that the computer-scored\n\nreport of the initial but invalid MMPI-2 had actually been more supportive of\n\nDr. Reynolds’s ultimate diagnosis. Its first sentence under “Diagnostic\n\nConsiderations” stated: “Many individuals with this profile are considered to\n\n                                        -26-\n\fhave severe Personality Disorders; however, the possibility of Schizophrenia,\n\nParanoid type, or of a Bipolar Affective Disorder should also be considered.” Id.,\n\nVol. 1 pt. 5 at 912. The same section in the report of the valid test did not\n\nsuggest consideration of schizophrenia, paranoid type.)\n\n      More dramatically, the prosecutor pointed out that the posttrial MMPI-2\n\nemphatically supported a picture of Defendant that correlated closely with the\n\npsychopath image elicited at trial. He asked about a section of the interpretive\n\nreport for the test that described Defendant as posing a continuing threat to\n\nsociety:\n\n      Q: MMPI-2, the second that you administered here, the valid one,\n      sir, refers to the Megargee scale; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: All right. And it classified Mr. Wilson as a type C offender;\n      correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: What does type C offender mean?\n\n      [Discussion of where to find the section of the report]\n\n      A: It indicates that these are difficult and criminal offenders.\n\n      Q: It also goes on to say that, in fact, type C inmates typically have\n      difficulty adjusting to prison life; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: It may be necessary to segregate them from weaker or more\n      vulnerable inmates; correct?\n\n                                         -27-\n\f      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And when it refers to treatment considerations in the last\n      paragraph on the page, the MMPI-2, the second one, the valid one\n      that you generated, it says that, in fact, Mr. Wilson—or individuals\n      with this profile type tend not to be very successful with treatment or\n      rehabilitation programs; is that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And it says it’s because they usually do not seek treatment on\n      their own and have little motivation to alter their behavior. Okay.\n      Well, could that extend to the taking of medication?\n\n      A: You mean whether they’ll take medication or not?\n\n      Q: Correct.\n\n      A: Well, medication is treatment, so it could.\n\n      ....\n\n            THE COURT: And it says . . . “Their suspicious attitudes and\n      deep-seated hostility toward others make them a difficult case for\n      rehabilitation.” That would be counterproductive to a strategy of\n      having an intelligent human being that could do well in a prison\n      environment and be rehabilitated; correct?\n\n             THE WITNESS: Correct.\n\n             THE COURT: It’s inconsistent?\n\n             THE WITNESS: Yes.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 129–131 (emphasis added). 6\n\n      6\n        The full description of Type C offenders from the interpretive report is\nchilling:\n       This client’s profile matches those of Type C offenders in the\n       Megargee typology. Individuals matching this profile type are\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                        -28-\n\f                       d.   Factual Support for Dr. Reynolds’s Diagnosis\n\n      As previously discussed, the basis of Dr. Reynolds’s rejection of the\n\ndiagnosis of “personality disorder, antisocial type” (which was suggested by the\n\nvalid posttrial MMPI-2 report) in favor of his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenic\n\ndisorder was his finding that Defendant suffered from delusions and auditory\n\nhallucinations. On cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds the prosecutor took aim at\n\nthat finding. The finding relied in large part on statements by Defendant’s family\n\nand girlfriend.\n\n      First, the prosecutor asked whether Dr. Reynolds had spoken with any of\n\nthe witnesses other than Defendant’s mother. Although Dr. Reynolds had\n\ntestified on direct examination that he had conducted interviews with at least two\n\n\n\n\n      6\n          (...continued)\n      among the most difficult criminal offenders. They are often viewed\n      as distrustful, cold, irresponsible, and unstable. They tend to have\n      antisocial, aggressive, and hostile attitudes toward others. They\n      engage in violent crimes against other people and usually have an\n      extensive criminal record. They tend to come from deviant and\n      stressful home environments and typically have a great deal of\n      difficulty adjusting to society. They are viewed by others as\n      alienated, bitter, rigid, and dogmatic. Their interpersonal\n      relationships are quite disruptive; their suspicious attitudes and deep-\n      seated hostility toward others make them a difficult case for\n      rehabilitation. Research has supported the view that Type C inmates\n      typically have difficulty adjusting to prison life. It may be necessary\n      to segregate them from weaker or more vulnerable inmates during\n      incarceration.\n\nR., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 1017.\n\n                                         -29-\n\fothers, he retreated from that assertion on cross-examination, saying that he may\n\nhave just relied on their affidavits. The exchange continued:\n\n      Q: Okay. And would it have been important to you to have sat down\n      and spoken with these family members who signed these affidavits?\n\n      A: I felt like the information that I got with them on an affidavit\n      under oath was adequate . . . and that it was valuable.\n\n      Q: Okay. And who—\n\n             THE COURT: How do you know whether that information is\n      true or not?\n\n             THE WITNESS: I don’t. . . . It’s not my job to investigate. I\n      take them for what they tell me. But what I saw was consistency\n      across the board, which gave me some sense that there was\n      truthfulness to it.\n\n              THE COURT: Unless someone drafts the affidavits for them?\n\n              THE WITNESS: True.\n\nId. at 118.\n\n      Later the prosecutor asked about the specifics of the statements by the\n\nvarious witnesses. He began by questioning Dr. Reynolds about his reliance on\n\nthree statements by Defendant’s girlfriend, Tonya Holt. The first was her\n\nstatement that he had told her that his father was dead:\n\n      Q: Okay. And one of the instances from the affidavits that you refer\n      to to support your diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia is Tonya\n      Holt’s affidavit, her statement that the defendant told her that his\n      father was dead; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\fQ: Do you remember that? Well, Doctor, do you recall what kind of\na relationship Mr. Wilson had with his father?\n\nA: It was rather distant and difficult.\n\nQ: Okay. Basically a non-entity in his life?\n\nA: Yes. Pretty much so.\n\nQ: Do you recall, was his father, you know—was he a homeless\nperson? Did he have a house? Do you recall what his social status\nwas in life?\n\nA: I believe that he had an issue with drugs and alcohol.\n\nQ: Okay. So is it possible, sir, that Mr. Wilson told Tonya Holt\nthat—\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.\n\n      THE COURT: Let him ask the question first.\n\nQ: Is it possible, sir, that Mr. Wilson told Ms. Holt that his father\nwas dead because he was embarrassed by his father?\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor; there’s no—\n\n      THE COURT: Calls for speculation?\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Exactly.\n\n      THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nQ: Is there a possible nonpsychotic explanation for Mr. Wilson’s\nstatement to Ms. Holt that his father was dead?\n\nA: None that I have.\n\nQ: None that you have that you received from the sources you read,\nor none that you’ve come up with?\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\f      A: I have no information to indicate that there was a different reason\n      that he might make that statement.\n\nId. at 131–32. 7 Dr. Reynolds apparently had forgotten what Holt had said in her\n\nstatement: “Micheal never explained to me why he said his father was dead. I\n\nthought Micheal meant his father Oscar was not being a father.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5\n\nat 854.\n\n      The second Holt statement about which the prosecutor questioned\n\nDr. Reynolds was her statement that Defendant had said his name was Tom, not\n\nMicheal:\n\n      Q: You cite the fact that Mr. Wilson—and this is according to\n      Ms. Holt’s affidavit—Mr. Wilson denied his name was Michael and\n      introduced himself as Tom. You cite that as a basis to support your\n      diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; correct?\n\n      A: That’s one of the delusions that I cited, yes.\n\n      Q: Okay. And you’ve reviewed the recording of Mr. Wilson’s\n      statement to the police; correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: He gives a confession?\n\n      A: Gave a confession, yes.\n\n      Q: Right?\n      And do you recall in that audio statement he tells the police, in\n      response to questioning, that he used the name Tommy when he\n      identified himself to the newspaper man who came into the store?\n      Do you recall that?\n\n      7\n       Although the objection to the question about embarrassment was sustained\nas speculative, the question later became relevant to probing Dr. Reynold’s bias.\n\n                                       -32-\n\f      A: I don’t. I don’t recall that.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 132–33. The prosecutor did not refer to Holt’s statement in her\n\naffidavit that when Defendant used the name “Tom,” she thought “he was just\n\nplaying.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 855.\n\n      Third, the prosecutor asked Dr. Reynolds about Holt’s suggestion that\n\nDefendant had auditory hallucinations:\n\n      Q: All right. Well, you cite Mr. Wilson’s statement to Tonya Holt\n      that he hears voices and you have to fight them away and pray them\n      away as an example of psychotic behavior supporting your paranoid\n      schizophrenia diagnosis; correct?\n\n      A: Correct.\n\n      Q: Okay. And in this situation, Mr. Wilson basically states that he\n      can control the voices; is that right?\n\n      A: I believe that he tries to control the voices through prayer.\n\n      Q: Okay. Because he states you can pray them away if you just pray\n      hard enough, fight hard enough; is that right?\n\n      A: Well, no, that’s not what he said. I don’t think he said that you\n      can pray them away or if you pray hard enough, but that was an\n      attempt which is very common for people with this disorder to make\n      these voice [sic] goes away. They usually try to do whatever they\n      can, and in this case he used religion to attempt to make the voices\n      go away because they told him to do things.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 133–34. Dr. Reynolds’s recollection was faulty. The affidavit of\n\nHolt in the record states that Defendant told her: “I hear voices & its OK. You\n\n\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fjust have to fight them, you just have to pray them away and they will go away.” 8\n\nId., Vol. 1, pt. 5 at 856.\n\n       Next, the prosecutor asked Dr. Reynolds whether his diagnosis was\n\nsupported by the statement of Defendant’s sister that he had told school officials\n\nthat his mother was white. Dr. Reynolds said that he did not recall how old\n\nDefendant was when he made the statements. The prosecutor reminded\n\nDr. Reynolds that the sister said that it was when they were in school together.\n\n(The sister’s affidavit states that Defendant was “just a kid” at the time. Id. at\n\n864.) He then continued:\n\n       Q: Okay. Sir, would it be unusual for paranoid schizophrenia to\n       onset in a young child?\n\n\n\n       8\n           The entirety of the paragraph from Holt’s affidavit stated:\n\n       After I was raped I had some severe mental problems that finally\n       forced me to seek counseling. I now know that I have been\n       diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I started\n       worrying when I would hear things—voices. I told Micheal about\n       the voices and he told me, ‘its O.K. to hear voices, I hear voices.’ I\n       said, no Micheal this is not like hearing your conscience tell you not\n       to do bad things, they are telling me things. Micheal told me, ‘I’ve\n       heard them too, I hear voices & its OK. You just have to fight them,\n       you just have to pray them away and they will go away.’ That is\n       when I started thinking he is really crazy, he has mental problems. I\n       asked him what kind of voices do you hear? He told me he didn’t\n       want to talk about it and he wouldn’t tell me anymore. I have sought\n       help and my doctor prescribed Zoloft and later on Xanax. I am not\n       on any medication now, and I do not hear the voices anymore.\n\nR., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 856.\n\n                                           -34-\n\f      A: The onset usually begi- —it’s not unusual. I mean, it does occur,\n      it’s not common, but the onset is usually the late teens to the early\n      forties, but it is not uncommon for it to occur in children.\n\n      Q: Okay. And Doctor, you’ve reviewed medical records from\n      Children’s Medical Center in preparation for your trial testimony; is\n      that correct?\n\n      A: That is correct.\n\nId., Vol. 2 at 134–35. Dr. Reynolds could not recall when Defendant had been\n\nseen at the center, but he was given records showing that Defendant was 16.\n\nDr. Reynolds then acknowledged that the doctors at the center had found no\n\nindication of psychotic behavior, specifically reporting the absence of delusions\n\nor hallucinations.\n\n      Similarly, the prosecutor suggested that another supposed delusion cited by\n\nDr. Reynolds was not indicative of mental illness:\n\n      Q: Okay. You cite Mr. Wilson’s belief, firm belief that he will be\n      released from prison as an example of unusual behavior supporting\n      your diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; is that right?\n\n      A: I believe that it was along the lines of not the diagnosis but that\n      was a delusional comment.\n\n      Q: Okay. Well, Doctor, have you had any experience with inmates\n      in the correctional system in the course of your career as a\n      psychologist?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And are there a lot of inmates who, in fact, may have an\n      irrational belief that they’re going to be released no matter how\n      strong the evidence is against them?\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\f       A: I think your word was correct, irrational.\n\n       Q: Are they all psychotic?\n\n       A: Of course not.\n\n                 [Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor; irrelevant.\n\n                 THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nId., at 136. 9\n\n       The prosecutor also challenged Dr. Reynolds’s statement in his affidavit\n\nthat Defendant may have been out of touch with reality at the time of trial.\n\nDr. Reynolds admitted that he had not interviewed the trial attorneys on the\n\nmatter.\n\n       Later the prosecutor inquired whether Defendant’s alleged paranoia might\n\nbe rational, rather than delusional:\n\n       Q: All right. In your report, you cite the fact that the defendant\n       believes he’s being plotted against as evidence supporting a\n       diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; correct?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Is it your understanding, sir, that Mr. Wilson was involved in\n       gang life?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       Q: Both before—well, at least before he went to jail; right?\n\n       A: Yes.\n\n       9\n       Although the objection was sustained, the prosecutor could have elicited\nthe same point through a properly phrased question.\n\n                                           -36-\n\f      Q: And do you recall, sir, that, in fact, he was having gang trouble\n      even in jail?\n\n      A: I understand there was some fights in jail. I didn’t know if it was\n      gang-related or not but I know there were some altercations.\n\n      Q: All right. I mean, gang life, the sort of gang life Mr. Wilson had,\n      is that a possible nonpsychotic explanation for his belief that he was\n      being plotted against?\n\n      A: Well, it would certainly fit into gang life, that is correct. And so,\n      therefore, that would be consistent with the development of a\n      paranoid disorder, whether how accurate it was that he was being\n      plotted against or not, but he would probably have, most likely with\n      this disorder, an exaggerated view of how he is out to be gotten or\n      killed. But there had some relative—there was some relevance to the\n      idea that he was definitely being plotted against, yes.\n\n      Q: I mean, you recall the situation where his mother’s house was\n      burned down; right?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\nId. at 138–39.\n\n      We also note a matter not explored during the hearing. Present in the\n\nrecord submitted to the district court was a telling discrepancy between\n\nDefendant’s responses on the pretrial invalid MMPI-2 and the posttrial valid\n\nMMPI-2. In the pretrial MMPI-2, under the “Critical Items” section for “Mental\n\nConfusion,” the interpretive report indicated that Defendant had answered “True”\n\nwhen asked to respond to the statement “I often hear voices without knowing\n\nwhere they come from.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 922. (Dr. Reynolds’s handwritten\n\nnotes on the pretrial report reflect that Defendant told him that when he was in\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fjail he heard two voices telling him to hang himself. Dr. Reynolds did not recall\n\nwhen he wrote the notes.) But on the posttrial MMPI-2 under the same Critical\n\nItems section, no such response is noted, meaning that Defendant apparently did\n\nnot answer this item “True” during the re-test. When administering the re-test,\n\nDr. Reynolds had instructed Defendant to ask for clarification or assistance if he\n\nhad difficulty understanding any of the questions. 10\n\n      This discrepancy may partly account for the fact that while the invalid\n\nMMPI-2 suggested that “Schizophrenia, Paranoid type” should be considered as a\n\npossible diagnosis, id. at 912, the valid MMPI-2 stated that “[i]ndividuals with\n\nthis MMPI-2 clinical profile are usually diagnosed as having a Personality\n\nDisorder, Antisocial type,” id. at 1017, and did not mention a possible diagnosis\n\nof schizophrenia. Dr. Reynolds testified that it was collateral data from the other\n\nwitnesses’ affidavits and the additional records furnished him by appellate\n\ncounsel that enabled him to arrive at the schizophrenia diagnosis.\n\n             3.    Redirect Examination of Dr. Reynolds\n\n      On redirect examination Dr. Reynolds reiterated his belief that he\n\nreasonably relied on the witness affidavits in forming his clinical opinion, and\n\n      10\n         Defendant’s responses on the “Mental Confusion” section were otherwise\nnearly identical. On the second MMPI-2, Defendant responded “True” to the\nstatement “I find it hard to keep my mind on a task or job.” R., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at\n1026. On the first MMPI-2, no response to this statement is indicated in the\n“Mental Confusion” section. Id. at 921–22. Other than the different responses to\nthat statement and the statement about voices, Defendant’s responses in the\nMental Confusion section were the same on both reports.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fthat he had not needed to interview the witnesses to obtain adequate information.\n\nHe clarified that although the valid MMPI-2 had contained indications of\n\nantisocial behavior, he thought that those patterns were “part of a paranoid\n\nschizophrenic process.” Id., Vol. 2 at 146. He testified that the actions of Type C\n\noffenders can be controlled in a prison. And he stated that the absence of\n\ndelusions and hallucinations reported in Defendant’s medical records from age 16\n\ndid not negate the schizophrenia diagnosis, because the onset of the disorder is\n\ntypically later in life.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n       A.     Standard of Review\n\n       Generally, when an applicant seeks relief from a state court conviction or\n\nsentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, we must apply the deferential standard of\n\nreview established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\n(AEDPA). If the state court adjudicated the federal claim that the applicant now\n\npresses on the merits,\n\n       we may only grant federal habeas relief if the habeas petitioner can\n       establish that the state court decision “was contrary to, or involved\n       an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n       determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” or “was\n       based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n       evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\n\nSaiz v.

Defendant requested an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the claim under Rule 3.11, Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals, Title 22, Ch. 18, App. (1995). The OCCA denied relief on the claim and\n\nDefendant’s request for an evidentiary hearing. See Wilson I, 983 P.2d at 471–72.\n\nAlthough noting Defendant’s “attempt to supplement the record with material not\n\nfound in the record,” id. at 472, the OCCA held that on the basis of its “review of\n\nthe trial record,” Defendant had failed to demonstrate either deficient\n\nperformance or prejudice on the mental-health issue, id.\n\n      On Defendant’s prior appeal we held that AEDPA deference was not\n\nrequired because the OCCA’s denial of Defendant’s request for an evidentiary\n\nhearing was not an adjudication “on the merits” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d). We noted (1) the OCCA’s apparent failure to consider Defendant’s\n\nnonrecord evidence in denying his request for an evidentiary hearing, and (2) the\n\nhigher threshold for triggering an evidentiary hearing under the OCCA’s Rule\n\n3.11 than permitted under the federal standard stated in Strickland v.

Recently, this court has\n\nadopted the State’s view. See Lott v. Trammell, No. 11-6096, slip op. at 79–83\n\n(10th Cir. Jan. 14, 2013). But we need not decide whether the OCCA’s decision\n\non the record before it requires that we affirm under AEDPA, because we deny\n\nrelief based on the evidence that Defendant asks us to consider.\n\n      In evaluating Defendant’s claim that his Sixth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated by ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing proceedings, we\n\napply the standard laid out in Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687:\n\n      A convicted defendant’s claim that counsel’s assistance was so\n      defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has\n      two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel’s\n      performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made\n      errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’\n      guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the\n      defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the\n      defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious\n      as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is\n      reliable.\n\nIn conducting this two-part inquiry, we need not address the performance and\n\nprejudice prongs in that order. See id. at 697 (Because defendants must establish\n\nboth components to prevail, “a court need not determine whether counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the\n\ndefendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.”). Here, we need address only\n\nprejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -41-\n\f      “An error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant\n\nsetting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on\n\nthe judgment.” Id. at 691. In a challenge to a capital sentence, “the question is\n\nwhether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . .\n\nwould have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” Id. at 695. We “must ask if the defendant\n\nhas met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely\n\nhave been different absent the errors.” Id. at 696.\n\n      To resolve whether there was prejudice, we do not consider omitted\n\nmitigation evidence in a vacuum. In Wong v. Belmontes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757/wong-v-belmontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009),\n\nthe defendant was sentenced to death after his counsel presented evidence of his\n\ndifficult family background during the sentencing hearing but declined to\n\nintroduce certain additional mitigating evidence (including expert testimony to\n\nexplain his behavior, see id. at 388–89, and evidence of a serious illness that\n\ncaused “emotional instability, impulsivity, and impairment of the\n\nneurophysiological mechanisms for planning and reasoning,” id. at 389 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)) out of concern that it would open the door for the\n\nprosecution to introduce evidence of a prior murder committed by the defendant,\n\nsee id. at 385–86. Counsel’s concern that this extremely harmful evidence would\n\nbe admitted if he introduced certain mitigating evidence was supported by the\n\ntrial court’s warning that it would allow the prosecution to put on the evidence if\n\n                                          -42-\n\fthe defense presented substantial evidence of the defendant’s nonviolent\n\ncharacter. See id. at 386. Rejecting the defendant’s ineffective-assistance-of-\n\ncounsel claim for failure to demonstrate prejudice, the Supreme Court held that in\n\nassessing prejudice a reviewing court must “consider all the relevant evidence\n\nthat the jury would have had before it if [the defendant] had pursued the different\n\npath—not just the mitigation evidence [the defendant] could have presented, but\n\nalso the [evidence of the other murder] that almost certainly would have come in\n\nwith it.” Id. Although some of the omitted mitigation evidence might have\n\nhelped the defendant, “the worst kind of bad evidence would have come in with\n\nthe good.” Id. at 390. Hence, the defendant had failed to show prejudice.\n\nFollowing the holding of Belmontes, we must consider not just the mitigation\n\nevidence that Defendant claims was wrongfully omitted, but also what the\n\nprosecution’s response to that evidence would have been.\n\n      In reviewing the district court’s conclusion that Defendant was not\n\nprejudiced by his counsel’s alleged deficiencies, “we accept the district court’s\n\nunderlying factual findings unless clearly erroneous, and we review de novo . . .\n\nwhether any deficiencies prejudiced the defendant.” United States v. Rodriguez-\n\nRivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170425\"><a href=\"/opinion/170425/united-states-v-rodriguez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1216 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe court ruled that introduction of the additional mental-health evidence\n\nsubmitted by Defendant at the court’s hearing on remand might well have been a\n\ndouble-edged sword, “support[ing] the prosecution’s portrayal of [Defendant] as a\n\n                                        -43-\n\fdangerous and continuing threat to society.” Wilson V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">744661</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *26.\n\nBecause of the “distinct possibility that additional mental health evidence might\n\nhave been counterproductive and harmed Defendant’s mitigation case,” the\n\ndistrict court could not “conclude that additional evidence of [Defendant’s]\n\nmental health problems would have affected the jury’s imposition of the death\n\npenalty.” Id. We agree with the district court that Defendant has not shown that\n\ntrial counsel’s alleged deficiencies prejudiced him.\n\n             1.     The Failure to Call Additional Family Witnesses\n\n      We first address Defendant’s argument that the witnesses who provided\n\naffidavits for his appeal, including his sister, brother, and girlfriend, should have\n\nbeen called during the mitigation case and that their testimony may have\n\nconvinced jurors to vote against death.\n\n      We look to the posttrial affidavits as proffers of how these witnesses would\n\nhave testified. These affidavits assert that Defendant was affected by gang\n\nviolence from his youth, stating that he sustained a gunshot injury in a drive-by\n\nshooting; that he was frequently targeted by rival gang members, who shot at him,\n\nvandalized his car, and burned the house he shared with his mother; and that he\n\nwas attacked by gang members, including members of his own gang, while\n\nincarcerated. But the jury heard about the drive-by shooting and arson incident\n\nduring Dr. Reynolds’s testimony on Defendant’s social history. Although\n\nDr. Reynolds did not speak from first-hand knowledge about either incident,\n\n                                          -44-\n\fneither, so far as the record shows, could any of the omitted witnesses. The\n\nadditional matter would not have qualitatively altered the picture of Defendant’s\n\nexposure to violence and could have merely emphasized his gang involvement.\n\n      The omitted witnesses might also have testified to some of Defendant’s\n\nunusual behaviors and thought processes, which Dr. Reynolds thought indicative\n\nof a mental disorder. The value of this evidence, however, depends on the value\n\nof Dr. Reynolds’s use of it, a matter we address in the next section of this\n\nopinion. Suffice it to say now that Defendant gives no reason to suppose that the\n\nevidence would have been more effective if presented by the witnesses in person\n\n(and subject to cross-examination), rather than through Dr. Reynolds’s testimony.\n\n             2.    Deficiencies in Dr. Reynolds’s Trial Preparation and\n                   Testimony\n\n      Defendant’s chief argument regarding prejudice relates to Dr. Reynolds’s\n\ntestimony. According to Defendant, had Dr. Reynolds been given sufficient time\n\nand information to conduct all necessary interviews and psychological tests\n\nproperly, he would have arrived at his diagnosis of schizophrenic paranoid\n\npersonality disorder before trial and, if properly prepared by counsel, could have\n\npresented that diagnosis to the jury and explained how Defendant’s background\n\ncontributed to his mental illness, demonstrated that Defendant’s mental illness\n\naffected his behavior and caused him to have difficulty conforming his conduct to\n\nthe law, and helped the jury understand the motivation for Defendant’s actions,\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\fthereby calling into question Defendant’s moral culpability. Defendant contends\n\nthat conveying this information would have caused at least one juror to believe\n\nthat Defendant was not deserving of capital punishment. And he asserts that had\n\ncounsel performed properly, the prosecutor would not have been able to elicit\n\ntestimony from Dr. Reynolds that supported the prosecutor’s repeated\n\ncharacterizations of Defendant as a psychopath.\n\n      In evaluating these claims of prejudice, we look to the testimony at the\n\nevidentiary hearing, together with the exhibits offered in evidence at that hearing,\n\nto see what likely would been presented at trial if Defendant’s counsel had done\n\nwhat he contends they should have. Our review indicates that Defendant would\n\nhave been no better off with the evidence presented at the hearing, and in\n\nsignificant ways would have been worse off.\n\n      We start with the MMPI-2. Since his direct appeal, Defendant has laid\n\ngreat stress upon the failure to obtain a valid MMPI-2 before trial.\n\nDr. Reynolds’s affidavit submitted to the OCCA in support of an evidentiary\n\nhearing states: “There was some evidence for a diagnosis of schizophrenia but\n\nbecause his first MMPI-2 was invalid, I needed additional testing, and further\n\ncollateral data to support this diagnosis. Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time\n\nto obtain this information before the trial.” R., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 845.\n\n      But the evidence from the hearing demonstrates that having Defendant\n\nretake the test did not help his case. The valid test contradicted more than it\n\n                                          -46-\n\fsupported Dr. Reynolds’s transition to a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenic\n\ndisorder. The interpretive report for the invalid test stated: “Many individuals\n\nwith this profile are considered to have severe Personality Disorders; however,\n\nthe possibility of Schizophrenia, Paranoid type, or of a Bipolar Affective\n\nDisorder should also be considered.” Id. at 912 (emphasis added). But the valid\n\ntest’s interpretive report said: “Individuals with this MMPI-2 clinical profile are\n\nusually diagnosed as having a Personality Disorder, Antisocial type.” Id. at 1017.\n\nIt did not suggest that schizophrenia be considered as a possible diagnosis.\n\n      Worse for Defendant, the interpretive report of the valid MMPI-2\n\nemphatically bolstered the prosecution’s position that Defendant was a continuing\n\nthreat to society. The invalid test’s interpretive report said that Defendant “fits\n\nequally well into more than one classification according to the Megargee\n\nclassification,” which was described as a “system for classifying male criminal\n\noffenders.” Id. at 912. The report did not say which classifications Defendant fit\n\nwithin, nor did it describe the characteristics of those classifications. The valid\n\ntest’s interpretive report, however, painted Defendant as being the most\n\ndespicable type of criminal. It said:\n\n      [Defendant’s] profile matches those of Type C offenders in the\n      Megargee typology. Individuals matching this profile type are\n      among the most difficult criminal offenders. They are often viewed\n      as distrustful, cold, irresponsible, and unstable. They tend to have\n      antisocial, aggressive, and hostile attitudes toward others. They\n      engage in violent crimes against other people and usually have an\n      extensive criminal record. They tend to come from deviant and\n\n                                         -47-\n\f      stressful home environments and typically have a great deal of\n      difficulty adjusting to society. They are viewed by others as\n      alienated, bitter, rigid, and dogmatic. Their interpersonal\n      relationships are quite disruptive; their suspicious attitudes and\n      deep-seated hostility toward others make them a difficult case for\n      rehabilitation. Research has supported the view that Type C inmates\n      typically have difficulty adjusting to prison life. It may be necessary\n      to segregate them from weaker or more vulnerable inmates during\n      incarceration.\n\nId. at 1017 (emphasis added). This is a roadmap for one seeking to portray\n\nDefendant as a dangerous criminal who could not safely be allowed to live.\n\n      When confronted at the evidentiary hearing with these statements\n\ncontradicting his diagnosis of Defendant, Dr. Reynolds stated that the test’s\n\nsuggested diagnoses merely provided “a hypothesis that you then correlate with\n\ncollateral data.” Id., Vol. 2 at 126. But the value of the collateral data on which\n\nhe relied—the statements by members of Defendant’s family and his girlfriend\n\nthat Dr. Reynolds found to be evidence of Defendant’s delusions and\n\nhallucinations—was undermined by the cross-examination of Dr. Reynolds at the\n\n§ 2254 evidentiary hearing. Indeed, Dr. Reynolds’s insistence that the statements\n\nprovided clear support for the diagnosis suggested sloppy analysis and bias,\n\nraising serious question about his credibility.\n\n      We note a few examples. First, as evidence of Defendant’s delusions,\n\nDr. Reynolds referred to the statement by Defendant’s sister that years earlier,\n\nwhen she and Defendant had attended the same school, Defendant had told school\n\nofficials that the two of them had different mothers and that his mother was\n\n                                         -48-\n\fwhite. But the statement was made when Defendant was “just a kid,” id., Vol. 1\n\npt. 5 at 864, and a later mental-health evaluation of Defendant administered by\n\nChildren’s Medical Center when he was 16 reported no delusions or\n\nhallucinations. After being confronted by this information on cross-examination,\n\nDr. Reynolds tried to explain away the mental-health evaluation during his\n\nredirect examination by noting that “usually the onset [of paranoid schizophrenia]\n\nis late teens to the early forties.” Id., Vol. 2 at 146. The explanation, however,\n\nmerely emphasizes the irrelevance of the “white mother” incident during\n\nDefendant’s childhood.\n\n      Second, Dr. Reynolds said that the presence of delusions and hallucinations\n\nwas supported by the untrue statement of Defendant to his girlfriend, Tonya Holt,\n\nthat his father was dead. Dr. Reynolds testified on cross-examination that he had\n\nno “possible nonpsychotic explanation” for Defendant’s statement, id. at 132,\n\neven after he had conceded that Defendant’s father was a man with drug and\n\nalcohol issues who was “pretty much” a non-entity in Defendant’s life, id. at 131,\n\nand the prosecutor had suggested that Defendant was simply embarrassed by his\n\nfather. Most remarkably, the very statement by Holt relied on by Dr. Reynolds\n\ncontinued: “[Defendant] never explained to me why he said his father was dead.\n\nI thought [Defendant] meant his father Oscar was not being a father.” Id., Vol. 1\n\npt. 5 at 854\n\n\n\n\n                                         -49-\n\f      Third, another statement from the Holt affidavit that Dr. Reynolds cited in\n\nsupport of the presence of delusions and hallucinations described Defendant’s\n\nhabit of sometimes introducing himself by a false name, Thomas, and adopting\n\ndifferent mannerisms. The prosecutor pointed out that Defendant had told police\n\n(in his murder confession) that he had used the name “Tommy” during the\n\nrobbery in order to conceal his identity. Id., Vol. 2 at 133. Dr. Reynolds did not\n\nrecall this information. He also apparently ignored Holt’s statement that “[she]\n\nalways thought it was strange [that Defendant used the name “Tom”], but [she]\n\nalso thought that he was just playing.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 855.\n\n      The best of this evidence of hallucinations was Holt’s statement that\n\nDefendant had told her that he heard voices. But even on this point Dr. Reynolds\n\nmisremembered facts that may have been relevant to his diagnosis. At the\n\nevidentiary hearing the prosecutor asked whether “[Defendant] state[d] you can\n\npray [the voices] away if you just pray hard enough, fight hard enough.” Id.,\n\nVol. 2 at 133. Dr. Reynolds responded: “Well, no, that’s not what he said. I\n\ndon’t think he said that you can pray them away or if you pray hard enough, but\n\nthat was an attempt which is very common for people with this disorder to make\n\nthese voice goes [sic] away.” Id. at 133–34. The prosecutor was not wrong.\n\nAccording to Holt, “[Defendant] told me, ‘I’ve heard them too, I hear voices & its\n\nOK. You just have to fight them, you just have to pray them away and they will\n\ngo away.’” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 856.\n\n                                         -50-\n\f      Another point on which Dr. Reynolds looked foolish was his finding that\n\nDefendant suffered from paranoia. He said in his affidavit: “[Defendant’s]\n\ndelusions appear to be of a grandiose and paranoid type. He believes . . . that he\n\nis being plotted against.” Id. at 848. But Defendant was a gang member, and a\n\nrival gang had shot him and set his mother’s home ablaze. Dr. Reynolds’s\n\nstruggle to construct a finding of delusional paranoia can be illustrated by the\n\nstatement in his affidavit that Defendant’s sister “described him as very\n\nsuspicious and paranoid,” id. at 847, when her full statement was:\n\n      I am familiar with the gang environment that [Defendant] grew up in\n      and I know it is no exaggeration to say that he was shot at on a daily\n      basis. I believe [Defendant] was being pulled into the gang scene by\n      at least his ninth grade year of high school. I remember [Defendant]\n      got real suspicious and paranoid after he joined the gang. He knew\n      it was a game of survival and he was always checking to see if\n      someone was in the house or near the car.\n\nId. at 865 (emphasis added).\n\n      In sum, Defendant has utterly failed to show that additional testing and\n\ninterviews would have produced a plausible diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenic\n\ndisorder. Nor has Defendant shown that better preparation of Dr. Reynolds could\n\nhave eliminated or weakened the prosecutor’s success at trial in characterizing\n\nDefendant as a psychopath. The term is used in the DSM-IV. It was even used\n\nby Dr. Reynolds in his draft affidavit for use in the appeal to the OCCA, before it\n\nwas deleted in the editing process. And little would have been gained by\n\nprohibiting use of the term because the description in the valid MMPI-2 of the\n\n                                         -51-\n\fDefendant’s profile—a Type C offender in the Megargee typology—explicitly\n\ndescribes the vision of evil evoked by the word psychopath.\n\n      Defendant’s evidence from the hearing also failed to establish any\n\nconnection between Dr. Reynolds’s diagnosis of Defendant and his commission of\n\nthe murder. Although Dr. Reynolds testified that knowing that Defendant\n\nsuffered from schizophrenic paranoid personality disorder might help a jury\n\nunderstand Defendant’s “motivation” for committing the crime, id., Vol. 2 at 72,\n\nthere was no credible evidence that Defendant acted as a result of delusions or\n\nhallucinations. Dr. Reynolds suggested in his affidavit: “It is possible that\n\n[Defendant] could have been delusional at the time of the crime; for example, he\n\nwent to his own place of employment knowing he would be observed by his co-\n\nworker, and customers. His thinking must have been delusional to believe that he\n\nwould not be easily identified.” Id., Vol. 1 pt. 5 at 848. But this ignores the\n\nplanning for the crime, the efforts to allay any suspicion by customers who\n\nentered before the perpetrators could remove the safe, and the murder of the one\n\nwitness who had known Defendant previously.\n\n      Finally, insofar as Defendant contends that his counsel were ineffective in\n\nnot even presenting adequately what Dr. Reynolds had determined from the\n\ninformation obtained before his trial testimony, Defendant has not satisfied his\n\nburden of showing what more Dr. Reynolds could usefully have said. He argues\n\nthat the jury should have been presented “a complete picture of [Defendant’s]\n\n                                         -52-\n\fmental health,” Aplt. Br. at 40; but he does not describe what that picture was. At\n\nmost, from what we can tell from the record, Dr. Reynolds had several possible\n\ndiagnoses stated in the interpretive report on the valid MCMI-III test; but we have\n\nno way of assessing how that would have played out at trial, particularly when\n\nDr. Reynolds has never stated that he had adopted one of those diagnoses at the\n\ntime of his trial testimony. Defendant also states that Dr. Reynolds could have\n\ntestified at trial that those with mental disease “have less capability of controlling\n\ntheir behavior in regards to the law.” Id. at 38 (quoting R. Vol. 2 at 88). Such a\n\nvague, generalized statement, however, is not the sort of mental-health evidence\n\nthat courts rely on to show prejudice; indeed, this statement seems as probative of\n\nfuture dangerousness as of diminished moral culpability.\n\n      We are not denigrating the value of mental-health evidence to support\n\nmitigation in a capital case, nor are we departing from our precedent addressing\n\nsuch evidence. We do not dispute that mental retardation and organic brain\n\ndamage are well-recognized grounds for mitigation. See Hooks v.

CONCLUSION\n\n       We AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Defendant’s claims under § 2254.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\f11-5031, Wilson v. Workman\n\nGORSUCH, J., Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n         The court convincingly explains why, even viewed de novo, the evidence\n\nthat emerged during the district court’s evidentiary hearing doesn’t help Mr.\n\nWilson’s cause. I write only to add that the hearing wasn’t necessary in the first\n\nplace.\n\n         That, of course, was what the district court thought from the start. When\n\nthe case originally came to it, the district court held that the OCCA’s ruling on\n\nMr. Wilson’s state court Rule 3.11 motion amounted to an adjudication on the\n\nmerits of his Sixth Amendment claim, applied AEDPA deference, and held the\n\nOCCA’s decision neither an unreasonable adjudication of federal law nor based\n\non an unreasonable determination of the facts. See Wilson v. Sirmons, No. 00-\n\nCV-147CVEFHM, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2289777</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *41-43 (N.D. Okla. Aug. 8, 2006).\n\n         Then things took a turn. Years of wrangling on appeal intervened and at\n\nthe end of it all this court reversed, instructing the district court to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing and conduct a de novo review of Mr. Wilson’s claim. This\n\ncourt reasoned that the OCCA’s Rule 3.11 decision failed to constitute an\n\n“adjudication on the merits” of Mr. Wilson’s Sixth Amendment claim so the\n\ndistrict court could afford it no deference. Wilson v. Workman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171083\"><a href=\"/opinion/171083/wilson-v-workman/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1290-93, 1299-1300 (10th Cir. 2009) (en banc). On remand, the district court\n\nproceeded to do as instructed, and did the job thoroughly and well. But this\n\nwhole process has turned out to be as needless as it was protracted. As our recent\n\fdecision in Lott v. Trammell, __ F.3d __, No. 11-6096, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">142067</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *42-\n\n44 (10th Cir. Jan. 14, 2013), explains, Wilson no longer controls: intervening\n\nevents have undone the essential premises on which it rested.\n\n        Rule 3.11 requires the OCCA to decide whether a petitioner has shown a\n\n“strong possibility” his counsel was constitutionally ineffective. From this it\n\nseems plain enough that an adjudication of a Rule 3.11 motion necessarily\n\nadjudicates a Strickland claim on the merits entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2554(d). If anything, Oklahoma’s standard appears less demanding than\n\nStrickland, requiring the petitioner to show only a strong possibility of a\n\nconstitutional violation, not an actual constitutional violation. That, of course, is\n\nexactly what the district court held.\n\n        Wilson, however, decided otherwise. It ruled that the OCCA’s Rule 3.11\n\ndecisions don’t constitute “adjudications on the merits” of Strickland claims\n\nentitled to deference under AEDPA. They don’t, Wilson said, because — as a\n\nmatter of state law — the OCCA doesn’t have to consider evidence outside the\n\ntrial and direct appeal record developed collaterally by the petitioner. Put simply,\n\nthis court held that a ruling on such an “incomplete record” is not “an\n\nadjudication on the merits to which we owe any deference.” Wilson, 577 F.3d at\n\n1291.\n\n        Since then, however, the OCCA has explained that Wilson was mistaken in\n\nits understanding of Oklahoma law. In fact, Rule 3.11 “obligates” the OCCA in\n\n                                        -2-\n\fevery case to “thoroughly review and consider a defendant’s Rule 3.11\n\napplication and affidavits along with other attached non-record evidence.” Lott,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">142067</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *44 (alterations omitted) (quoting Simpson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2626226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2626226/simpson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 905 (Okla. Crim. App. 2010)). Thus, the essential premise on which Wilson\n\nstood has now evaporated. It turns out the OCCA does review all of a petitioner’s\n\nevidence, even evidence outside the trial and direct appeal record. Neither may\n\nwe ignore the OCCA’s interpretation of its own rule. After all, state courts, not\n\nwe, have the final say when it comes to explaining the meaning of state law. See\n\nLott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">142067</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *44.\n\n      Of course, while the petitioner in a state Rule 3.11 motion enjoys a lower\n\nstandard of proof than in a federal Strickland claim, he also faces what appears to\n\nbe a higher evidentiary burden. See Wilson, 577 F.3d at 1297. To win a Rule\n\n3.11 motion in state court, a petitioner must present “clear and convincing”\n\nevidence of a “strong possibility” of a Sixth Amendment violation: meanwhile, to\n\nwin a Strickland claim in federal court a petitioner must show an actual Sixth\n\nAmendment violation under a preponderance of the evidence standard. Despite\n\nthis difference in language, the State of Oklahoma argued in Wilson that, as a\n\nmatter of state law, Rule 3.11’s “clear and convincing” evidentiary standard is\n\nreally no more demanding than the federal “preponderance of the evidence”\n\nstandard. In support of its view, the State pointed to state case law indicating that\n\na Rule 3.11 petitioner’s evidentiary burden is modest, requiring only the\n\n                                         -3-\n\fpresentation of persuasive evidence, as opposed to “speculation, second guesses,\n\nor innuendo.” Id. at 1298 (quoting Jones v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634939\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634939/jones-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 890 (Okla.\n\nCrim. App. 2009)); see also id. at 1306 (Tymkovich, J., dissenting) (offering this\n\nsame interpretation of state law). The Wilson court, however, rejected this\n\ninterpretation of state law. It read Rule 3.11 as imposing a more onerous\n\nevidentiary duty on litigants in state court than they would face in federal court\n\nand proceeded to question whether, in this light, a Rule 3.11 ruling could qualify\n\nas an adjudication on the merits of a Strickland claim entitled to AEDPA\n\ndeference. Id. at 1298-99.\n\n      Once again, however, the OCCA has since intervened. And once again it\n\nhas assured us that its evidentiary standard is “intended to be less demanding than\n\nthe test imposed by Strickland.” Lott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">142067</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *44 (quoting Simpson,\n\n230 P.3d at 906) (emphasis added). It has clarified that “when [it] review[s] and\n\nden[ies] a request for an evidentiary hearing on a claim of ineffective assistance\n\nunder the standard set forth in Rule 3.11, [it] necessarily make[s] the adjudication\n\nthat Appellant has not shown defense counsel to be ineffective under the more\n\nrigorous federal standard set forth in Strickland.” Id. (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting Simpson, 230 P.3d at 906). And, once again, the OCCA’s views of state\n\nlaw are controlling. Even if its interpretation doesn’t seem obvious to us, a state\n\ncourt is free to interpret its evidentiary rules as it wishes and free to interpret a\n\nstate “clear and convincing” standard as requiring no more proof than the federal\n\n                                          -4-\n\f“preponderance of the evidence” standard. Certainly the State of Oklahoma in\n\nWilson understood Rule 3.11’s evidentiary standard to require no more and after\n\nthe OCCA’s ruling in Simpson that understanding seems to stand confirmed. As\n\nLott has recognized, we must now accept “as a matter of federal law” that a Rule\n\n3.11 ruling “operates as an adjudication on the merits of the Strickland claim and\n\nis therefore entitled to deference under § 2254(d)(1).” Id.\n\n      Of course, if the OCCA should later rule in a way that suggests it is using a\n\nhigher evidentiary standard than Strickland employs we would have renewed\n\nquestions. In those circumstances, it seems to me the use of a higher evidentiary\n\nstandard than federal law prescribes could very well render the OCCA’s\n\nadjudication of a particular federal claim unreasonable — and so reversible —\n\nunder § 2254(d)(1). But while the OCCA’s choice of a different but conventional\n\nrule of evidence than federal courts use when ruling on a federal claim might\n\nexpose it to a greater chance of reversal when the case comes to federal court, it\n\nis less clear to me whether that might render the state court’s final decision on the\n\nclaim something entirely alien, something other than an adjudication on the\n\nmerits of the claim entitled to deference in the first instance.\n\n      Happily, though, none of these potential problems appears to be live ones\n\ntoday. For now, the essential state law premises on which Wilson rested no\n\nlonger appear operative, having been superseded by the OCCA’s definitive\n\nexposition of the meaning of its own rule. Accordingly and as Lott has held, we\n\n                                          -5-\n\fowe AEDPA deference to the OCCA’s adjudication of Rule 3.11 motions. Seven\n\nyears ago the district court concluded as much and explained in great detail why\n\nthe OCCA’s decision in this particular case did not offend § 2254(d).
