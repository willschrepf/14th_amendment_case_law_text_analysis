Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶¶ a, b, d, e [Dkt. # 1]. The complaint also seeks a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that defendant’s withholding of the Assessment and notes violated\n\nplaintiff’s rights under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b) (2012) (Count III). Id. ¶¶ c, f.\n\n       During the pendency of the case, defendant released the asylum officer’s notes to the\n\nplaintiff, rendering Count I moot. The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment on\n\nthe remaining two counts. Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mot.”) [Dkt. # 17]; Def.’s Mem. in\n\nSupp. of its Mot. for Summ. J. & Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. (“Def.’s Mot.”) [Dkt. # 23]. After a review\n\nof the Assessment in camera, the Court finds that the Assessment is protected by the deliberative\n\nprocess privilege and that the privilege has not been waived. It also finds, however, that the\n\ninitial factual recitation contained in the first six paragraphs is not deliberative and is reasonably\n\fsegregable from the deliberative portion of the document. As a result, the Court will grant\n\ndefendant’s motion for summary judgment in part and deny it in part, and it will grant plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment in part and denying it in part with respect to Count II. The Court\n\nwill also dismiss Count III because it is not ripe.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n   I.      LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n   A. The asylum application process.\n\n        Individuals seeking asylum in the United States may file an application for asylum with\n\nthe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), which is a component of the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Def.’s Statement of Material Facts as to which\n\nthere is no Genuine Dispute (“Def.’s SOF”) ¶ 4 [Dkt. # 23]. USCIS then reviews the application\n\nand decides whether it should be granted or denied. If the application is granted, the individual\n\nis permitted to stay in the United States.        If USCIS determines that it cannot grant the\n\napplication, it will notify the individual of that decision, and what happens next depends on\n\nwhether the applicant was legally (“in-status”) or illegally (“out-of-status”) in the United States\n\nat the time the asylum application was filed. Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 2, 6.\n\n        Asylum applicants who are in-status are sent what is called a Notice of Intent to Deny\n\n(“NOID”). Id. ¶ 16. The NOID explains that USCIS cannot approve the asylum application, and\n\nit notifies the applicant that he or she has sixteen days to respond to the NOID by submitting\n\nadditional information and supporting documents. Id. ¶¶ 17–18; Pl.’s Statement of Material\n\nFacts not in Dispute (“Pl.’s SOF”) ¶ 15 [Dkt. # 18]. If, after the submission of additional\n\nmaterial, USCIS continues to believe the asylum application should be denied, the asylum officer\n\n(“AO”) assigned to the case (subject to approval by the Supervisory AO) will advise the alien\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fthat the application has been denied. Def.’s SOF ¶ 19. An in-status alien whose application has\n\nbeen denied does not have any right to further review of the denial. Id. ¶ 20.\n\n       If the applicant is out-of-status, on the other hand, the AO prepares what is called an\n\n“Assessment to Refer” (“Assessment”) instead of a NOID. The Assessment includes the AO’s\n\nrecommendation that the application be denied and that the out-of-status applicant be referred to\n\nthe immigration court for removal proceedings.        Def.’s SOF ¶ 8; Pl.’s SOF ¶¶ 2–5. The\n\nAssessment also includes the reasoning underlying the AO’s recommendation. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 8.\n\n       After the AO drafts the Assessment, the Supervisory AO reviews and initials the\n\ndocument. Def.’s SOF ¶ 8; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 2. The Assessment is then placed in the asylum\n\napplicant’s file, and the file is transferred to the DHS lawyer who will represent the government\n\nat the immigration court proceeding. Def.’s SOF ¶ 9; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 4. The Assessment is not\n\nprovided to the asylum applicant. Def.’s SOF ¶ 9. Instead, USCIS generates a Referral Notice,\n\nwhich informs the out-of-status applicant that USCIS cannot grant the asylum request and that\n\nthe case was referred to the immigration court. Id. ¶ 10; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 5. The Referral Notice also\n\ninforms the applicant of the reasons for the denial of the application and of the right to renew the\n\nasylum request before the immigration court, which will conduct a de novo review. Def.’s SOF\n\n¶ 12. If the immigration judge denies the asylum application, the alien can appeal that decision\n\nto the Board of Immigration Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals. Id. ¶ 15.\n\n       At the de novo immigration proceeding before the immigration court, the alien’s statutory\n\nrights are governed by 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. Among those rights, and most pertinent to this case, is\n\nthe requirement that “the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence\n\nagainst the alien, to present evidence on the alien’s own behalf, and to cross examine witnesses\n\npresented by the Government.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B).\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f         A DHS lawyer may – but is not required to – present the Assessment prepared by the AO\n\nas evidence at the immigration proceeding. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 10; Def.’s SOF ¶ 14. If the lawyer elects\n\nto do so, then section 1229a(b)(4)(B) requires that the alien be accorded a reasonable opportunity\n\nto examine the Assessment. Def.’s SOF ¶ 14.\n\n   II.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n         Plaintiff Anteneh Abtew is a native and citizen of Ethiopia. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 1. On February\n\n17, 2012, he arrived in the United States on a tourist visa, which has since expired. Id.; Def.’s\n\nSOF ¶ 3. He applied for asylum in the United States with USCIS as an out-of-status applicant,1\n\nand on October 9, 2012, an AO in the Arlington Asylum Office interviewed him about his\n\napplication. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 1. During the interview, the AO and plaintiff communicated through an\n\ninterpreter, and the AO took notes. Id.\n\n         After the interview, the AO prepared a four-page Assessment. Id. ¶¶ 2–3; Def’s SOF ¶ 6.\n\nThe Assessment memorialized the AO’s recommendation that plaintiff’s asylum application\n\nshould be denied, and after review, the AO’s supervisor initialed it. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 2; Def.’s SOF\n\n¶¶ 6–7. The Assessment was then placed into plaintiff’s file, and that file was transferred to the\n\nDHS lawyer who will represent the United States at plaintiff’s immigration proceeding. Pl.’s\n\nSOF ¶ 4; Def.’s SOF ¶ 9. Plaintiff was not provided a copy of the Assessment. Def.’s SOF ¶ 9.\n\n         USCIS then generated a Referral Notice, informing plaintiff of USCIS’s decision. The\n\nReferral Notice stated that USCIS reached its decision because of “[m]aterial inconsistency(ies)\n\nbetween     [plaintiff’s]   testimony and   application   and/or   other   evidence[,]   [m]aterial\n\ninconsistency(ies) within [plaintiff’s] testimony[,] [and] [l]ack of detail(s) on material points.”\n\n\n\n1      Because plaintiff’s visa expired prior to the filing of his application for asylum, he is\nconsidered an out-of-status applicant.\n\n                                                4\n\fReferral Notice, Ex. E to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. (“Referral Notice”) [Dkt.\n\n# 23-1]; see also Pl.’s SOF ¶ 5; Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 10–11. It also informed plaintiff of the next steps\n\nin the process: that the asylum case would be referred to an immigration judge for further\n\nproceedings, that the referral is not a denial of the asylum application, and that USCIS’s initial\n\ndecision to deny the petition is not binding on the immigration judge, who will conduct a de novo\n\nreview of plaintiff’s request. Referral Notice; see also Def.’s SOF ¶ 12. Plaintiff’s immigration\n\ncourt proceeding is scheduled for February 18, 2015. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 9.\n\n       On November 11, 2012, plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to obtain a copy of the\n\nAssessment as well as the notes the AO took during plaintiff’s interview. Pl.’s FOIA Request,\n\nEx. A to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. [Dkt. # 23-1]. In response, defendant\n\nproduced ninety-two pages in their entirety and five pages in part, while withholding twenty-\n\nthree pages in full under FOIA Exemptions 5, 6, 7C, and 7E. Resp. to Pl.’s FOIA Request, Ex. C\n\nto Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. [Dkt. # 23-1].           Plaintiff appealed the\n\nwithholdings, Pl.’s FOIA Appeal, Ex. D to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. [Dkt.\n\n# 23-1], and that appeal was denied. Appeal Denial Letter, Ex. E to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex.\n\nA to Def.’s Mot. [Dkt. # 23-1].\n\n       Plaintiff then filed this FOIA action against DHS, seeking to obtain (1) the notes of the\n\nAO and (2) the Assessment, Compl. ¶¶ 54–59, as well as a declaration that the continued\n\nwithholding of those documents violated plaintiff’s rights under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b). Id. ¶¶ 60–\n\n65. Defendant subsequently released the notes to plaintiff – rendering Count I moot – but it\n\ncontinued to invoke the deliberative process privilege to withhold the Assessment.         Def.’s\n\nAnswer at 1 [Dkt. # 15]. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the Court\n\nordered production of the Assessment for in camera review.\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). The party seeking summary judgment bears the “initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\n\nany, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex\n\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat\n\nsummary judgment, the non-moving party must “designate specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.” Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted). The existence of a factual\n\ndispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n\n242, 247–48 (1986). A dispute is “genuine” only if a reasonable fact-finder could find for the\n\nnon-moving party; a fact is only “material” if it is capable of affecting the outcome of the\n\nlitigation. Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\n       “The rule governing cross-motions for summary judgment . . . is that neither party waives\n\nthe right to a full trial on the merits by filing its own motion; each side concedes that no material\n\nfacts are at issue only for the purposes of its own motion.” Sherwood v. Wash. Post, 871 F.2d\n\n1144, 1148 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1989), quoting McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 68 n.3 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1982). In assessing each party’s motion, “[a]ll underlying facts and inferences are analyzed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.” N.S. ex rel. Stein v. District of Columbia, 709\n\nF. Supp. 2d 57, 65 (D.D.C. 2010), citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247.\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n       The cross-motions for summary judgment raise two issues:              first, the Court must\n\ndetermine whether defendant properly invoked FOIA Exemption 5 to deny plaintiff’s request for\n\n                                                 6\n\fthe Assessment completed in connection with his asylum petition, and if so, whether defendant\n\nreasonably segregated all nonexempt material from that document (Count II). And second, the\n\nCourt must decide whether the withholding of the Assessment violates plaintiff’s rights under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B) (Count III).\n\n   I.      Exemption 5 covers the Assessment in this case.\n\n        FOIA Exemption 5 bars disclosure of “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or\n\nletters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the\n\nagency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). A document may be properly withheld under Exemption 5 only\n\nif it satisfies “two conditions: its source must be a [g]overnment agency, and it must fall within\n\nthe ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation\n\nagainst the agency that holds it.” U.S. Dep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective\n\nAss’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8 (2001). This Circuit has interpreted Exemption 5 “to encompass the\n\nprotections traditionally afforded certain documents pursuant to evidentiary privileges in the civil\n\ndiscovery context, including materials which would be protected under the attorney-client\n\nprivilege, the attorney work-product privilege, or the executive deliberative process privilege.”\n\nFormaldehyde Inst. v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 889 F.2d 1118, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 1989)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The agency seeking to withhold a document bears the\n\nburden of showing that it falls within the cited exemption. Natural Res. Def. Counsel, Inc. v.\n\nNuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 216 F.3d 1180, 1190 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n        Here, defendant invokes Exemption 5 to justify its withholding of the Assessment, stating\n\nthat the document falls under the executive deliberative process privilege. Def.’s Mot. at 5.\n\nPlaintiff advances nine arguments as to why Exemption 5 cannot be invoked in this case. Pl.’s\n\nMot. at 8–30. These arguments can be organized into two categories: (A) those that claim that\n\nthe deliberative process privilege, and therefore Exemption 5, do not cover the Assessment; and\n                                                 7\n\f(B) those that posit that even if the Assessment is covered by the deliberative process privilege,\n\ndefendant still cannot invoke Exemption 5 to justify its withholding the Assessment.2            Id.\n\nNeither category of arguments withstands scrutiny.\n\n   A. The Assessment falls within Exemption 5 because it is protected by the deliberative\n      process privilege.\n\n       “The deliberative process privilege rests on the obvious realization that officials will not\n\ncommunicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery,” and its\n\npurpose “is to enhance ‘the quality of agency decisions’ by protecting open and frank discussion\n\namong those who make them within the [g]overnment.” Klamath, 532 U.S. at 8–9 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted). As a result, it only “protects agency documents that are\n\nboth predecisional and deliberative.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 151 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2006); see also McKinley v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys., 647 F.3d 331, 339 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011). This Circuit has held that “a document [is] predecisional if ‘it was generated before the\n\nadoption of an agency policy’ and deliberative if ‘it reflects the give-and-take of the consultative\n\nprocess.’” Judicial Watch, 449 F.3d at 151, quoting Coastal States Gas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nEnergy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980). As the D.C. Circuit has stated, documents fall\n\nwithin the purview of the deliberative process privilege “only if they ‘reflect[] advisory opinions,\n\nrecommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental\n\ndecisions and policies are formulated, [or] the personal opinions of the writer prior to the\n\nagency’s adoption of a policy.” Public Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Mgmt. & Budget, 598 F.3d 865,\n\n875 (D.C. Cir. 2009), quoting Taxation With Representation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 677\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1981).\n\n\n2       Plaintiff does not contest that the Assessment satisfies the first condition of Exemption 5\n– that the document withheld be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter. See\nPl.’s Mot. at 8–30. As a result, the Court finds that requirement is satisfied in this case.\n                                                 8\n\f        Applying that framework here, the Court finds that the Assessment is predecisional and\n\ndeliberative, and that it therefore falls under the deliberative process privilege. In a declaration\n\nsubmitted along with defendant’s cross-motion for summary judgment, Jill A. Eggleston – the\n\nAssistant Center Director in the FOIA and Privacy Act Unit, National Records Center, USCIS –\n\nexplains that the Assessment at issue in this case is a document that “predates USCIS’s decision\n\nto not grant asylum to the Plaintiff,” and that “[t]he document forms the basis for the decision to\n\nnot grant the Plaintiff asylum and instead refer him to an immigration judge for removal\n\nproceedings.” Decl. of Jill A. Eggleston (“Eggleston Decl.”), Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. ¶¶ 1, 17 [Dkt.\n\n# 23-1].3 She also explains that the AO writes the Assessment “in narrative form, and explains\n\nthe officer’s concerns, discusses possible legal insufficiencies in the application, and the reasons\n\nfor the decision to refer the case to the immigration court,” which makes it an “essential part of\n\nthe USCIS deliberative process that leads to the ultimate determination to deny an alien’s\n\napplication for asylum” and to instead refer the out-of-status applicant for removal proceedings.\n\nId. ¶ 17.\n\n        In other words, the Eggleston declaration verifies that the AO writes the Assessment\n\nbefore a final decision is made; that the Assessment is an essential tool in making that decision;\n\n\n\n3       Plaintiff argues that the Court cannot rely on the Eggleston Declaration because\nEggleston did not state that she has any personal knowledge of the procedures inside an asylum\noffice or that she read the Assessment in this case. Pl.’s Opp. to Def.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Opp.”) at 4\n[Dkt. # 26]. But as another court in this district previously explained, the “extent of Eggleston’s\nknowledge of the asylum process is largely irrelevant. What matters is her capacity to explain\nthe legal basis for the defendant’s withholding of the assessment under the FOIA.” Anguimate v.\nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 918 F. Supp. 2d 13, 19 (D.D.C. 2013). Moreover, the last\nparagraph of the declaration explains that the Assessment is fully described in the declaration,\nthat she is familiar with the matters described in the declaration, and that she can “attest to the\naccuracy of the document descriptions and applicability of the FOIA exemptions asserted.”\nEggleston Decl. ¶ 20. This is sufficient for the Court to be able to rely on the declaration. See\nAnguimate, 918 F. Supp. 2d at 19.\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fand that the Assessment includes the AO’s personal thoughts about the merits of the asylum\n\ncase. It is therefore both predecisional and deliberative, bringing it under the protection of the\n\ndeliberative process privilege.4 See Abramyan v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 12-1064,\n\n2013 WL 6247338, at *6 (D.D.C. Dec. 4, 2013) (holding that the Assessment to Refer in that\n\n\n\n\n4        Plaintiff argues that the Assessment is not deliberative because it does not reflect the\ngive-and-take of the consultative process, since the AO writes the document on his or her own.\nPl.’s Opp. at 4–5, 11–12. But this is an overly narrow view of what can be part of the\ndeliberative process. The Assessment transmits the AO’s thoughts to a supervisory official and\nit is a step leading to the issuance of a decision; just because it includes the “give,” but not the\n“take,” does not take it outside the scope of the conversation. And as plaintiff acknowledges,\nprotecting the give-and-take of the consultative process is only one of the reasons for the\nprivilege, and a document is considered deliberative if it includes recommendations for how a\ndecision should be made, which the Assessment does. See Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866.\n         Similarly, plaintiff’s argument that deliberative process privilege should not apply to this\ncase because the frequent disclosure of Assessments in immigration courts cuts against the need\nto protect the internal discussions of AO officers also fails. Pl.’s Opp. at 5, 12–13; Pl.’s Reply in\nSupp. of Pl.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 1, 3, 16 [Dkt. # 25]. Putting aside the realization that just\nbecause a privilege is waived in one context does not mean that it is less important in another\ncontext, the Court cannot force disclosure under FOIA on this ground alone. As another court in\nthis district has recognized, the D.C. Circuit has instructed district courts not “to ‘second-guess\n. . . congressional judgment’” that a document is subject to the protections of the deliberative\nprocess privilege “‘on a case-by-case basis’; rather, once it is determined that the two elements\nof the deliberative process privilege are satisfied, the judicial inquiry is complete.” Anguimate,\n918 F. Supp. 2d at 20, quoting McKinley, 647 F.3d at 339.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fcase was both predecisional and deliberative); Anguimate v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 918 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 13, 18–21 (D.D.C. 2013) (same).5\n\n       Plaintiff’s arguments do not alter that conclusion. First, he argues that the Assessment is\n\na final, post-decision document because it was initialed by the Supervisory AO and sent to a\n\nDHS lawyer who would represent the government in plaintiff’s removal proceeding before the\n\nimmigration court. Thus, he contends that the Assessment is the document that “disposes” of\n\nplaintiff’s request for asylum to the extent that it is before USCIS. Pl.’s Mot. at 18–19. But the\n\ndocument cannot be postdecisional in the literal sense of the word because the AO drafted it\n\nbefore the final decision was made, and the requirement that the Supervisory AO review the\n\nAssessment does not somehow transform it into a “final agency” decision just because the\n\nsupervisor initialed it; the Supervisory AO’s initials are not just a “rubber stamp.”             See\n\nAbramyan, 2013 WL 6247338, at *6. Moreover, the Assessment does not actually “dispose” of\n\nplaintiff’s asylum petition.   It is the Decision Letter – in this case, the Referral Notice – that\n\n\n\n\n5       Plaintiff argues that Anguimate and Abramyan are distinguishable because at the time the\ncourts found that the Assessments at issue in those cases were protected by the deliberative\nprocess privilege and therefore properly withheld under Exemption 5, the plaintiffs in those cases\nhad already been granted asylum by the immigration court. Pl.’s Mot. at 9–10; Pl.’s Opp. at 9–\n11. But that procedural posture does not distinguish the legal question in those cases from the\none in front of this Court: although in Anguimate and Abramyan the procedural posture\nguaranteed that the government would not later introduce the Assessment before the immigration\ncourt, the government has not yet used – and may ultimately decide not to use – the Assessment\nat issue here in plaintiff’s immigration proceeding. As a result, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a has not been\nimplicated as of the date of the decision of this case and, despite plaintiff’s arguments to the\ncontrary, defendant has not adopted the Assessment as its final decision. The Court therefore\nfinds the cases to be persuasive in resolving plaintiff’s claims in this case. Indeed, the distinction\nindicates that plaintiff may very well receive a copy of the Assessment in the future without any\naction by this Court.\n                                                 11\n\fofficially disposes of the asylum petition on behalf of USCIS.6 Eggleston Decl. ¶ 17 (“The\n\nAgency’s final decision is the Referral Notice, which is signed by the [Supervisory AO] for the\n\nDirector of Asylum Office.”).\n\n       The cases plaintiff relies on to support his point that the Assessment is the final decision\n\nthat disposes of the case do not support his position. See Pl.’s Mot. at 18–20. It is true that the\n\nSupreme Court has held that Exemption 5 cannot be invoked to withhold documents that must be\n\ndisclosed under section 552(a)(2)(A), see NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975),\n\nbecause they are “final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders,\n\nmade in the adjudication of cases.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)(A); see also Pl.’s Mot. at 18–20. But\n\nthe cases plaintiff cites applying that principle involve either a decision not to institute judicial\n\nproceedings, therefore “adjudicating” the merits of the case, see Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. U.S.\n\nDOJ, 235 F.3d 598, 603 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (dealing with a document that memorialized the\n\ndecision not to prosecute a U.S. Attorney), or the actual adjudication of a case, resulting in a\n\nfinding of liability that could only be displaced if successful on appeal. See Am. Mail Line, Ltd.\n\nv. Gulick, 411 F.2d 696 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (involving a case where the Maritime Subsidy Board\n\nordered the plaintiff to refund $3 million in subsidies); Nat’l Prison Project of Am. Civil\n\n\n\n6       Plaintiff argues that there is a factual dispute as to whether the Assessment or the Referral\nNotice is the final decision by USCIS with respect to plaintiff’s asylum petition. Pl.’s Opp. at 2–\n3; Pl.’s Reply at 10. But what constitutes a “final decision” is not a factual question; it a legal\none that can be properly decided by this Court. And the evidence before this Court indicates that\nthe Referral Notice is the final decision, not the Assessment. The Referral Notice was written\nafter USCIS made the final decision to deny plaintiff’s request, and it notified plaintiff of that\ndecision and his appeal rights.            The Assessment, on the other hand, contains the\nrecommendations of an AO on what the final decision about plaintiff’s asylum request should be,\nit was written before the final decision was made, and – as discussed more below – it was not\nadopted as or incorporated into USCIS’s final decision. Accordingly, the Court finds that the\nReferral Notice was the final decision in this case. This conclusion is not altered just because the\nReferral Notice is created “by checking boxes on a computer.” Pl.’s Opp. at 5.\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fLiberties Union Found., Inc. v. Sigler, 390 F. Supp. 789 (D.D.C. 1975) (finding that a written\n\ndenial of parole is a final order for purposes of FOIA). Neither of those situations is present\n\nhere:   the denial of plaintiff’s asylum application initiates and does not conclude judicial\n\nproceedings and, although the AO investigated plaintiff’s asylum request and compared different\n\nfactual claims, it does not rise to the level of an “adjudication” because the matter will be\n\ndetermined de novo in the immigration court.\n\n        Moreover, the other three cases to which plaintiff refers deal with documents that set\n\nforth the agency’s interpretation of its regulations or statutes in the context of a particular set of\n\nfacts. See Schlefer v. United States, 702 F.2d 233 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Coastal States, 617 F.2d at\n\n854; Tax Analysts & Advocates v. IRS, 362 F. Supp. 1298 (D.D.C. 1973). The documents were\n\nprepared by higher-level officials and created the internal agency “law” that guided the decision-\n\nmaking process of lower-level officials. But a recommendation that an asylum petition be\n\ndenied does not set out “law” for AOs to apply in future cases or an interpretation of an\n\nambiguous statutory provision. It is a recommendation as to how USCIS should proceed with a\n\nparticular application, and therefore there is no concern in this case that the agency is developing\n\n“secret law” that it is trying to hide from the public. Compare Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 868\n\n(explaining that the documents at issue in that case were not protected by the deliberative process\n\nprivilege because they were “not advice to a superior, nor [were] they suggested dispositions of a\n\ncase,” and instead they were “akin to a ‘resource’ opinion about the applicability of existing\n\npolicy to a certain state of facts, like examples in a manual, to be contrasted to a factual or\n\nstrategic advice giving opinion”). Furthermore, the Assessment is not a higher-level official\n\ntelling a lower-level official how to exercise his or her discretion: it is a recommendation that\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fflows from the lower-level employee to a higher-level official. As a result, those cases offer no\n\nguidance here.\n\n       And finally, the Supreme Court’s holding in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. – the case\n\nthat established the rule that Exemption 5 cannot justify withholding documents that must be\n\nreleased under section 552(a)(2)(A) – actually supports the continued withholding of the\n\nAssessment under Exemption 5 in this case. In Sears, the Supreme Court addressed whether an\n\nAdvice and Appeals Memorandum (“AAM”) issued by the General Counsel of the National\n\nLabor Relations Board (“NLRB”) regarding whether he would file a complaint based on a\n\nprivate party’s report of a potential NLRA violation could be withheld as an intra-agency\n\nmemorandum under Exemption 5 or whether it was a “final opinion” as defined in 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(2)(A). 421 U.S. at 136. The Court held that an AAM that memorialized the decision to\n\nnot file a complaint was a final agency opinion because it adjudicated the potential issue and\n\nforeclosed any potential judicial proceedings unless the party seeking legal action successfully\n\nappealed the General Counsel’s decision. Id. at 155–59. But the Court found that an AAM that\n\nagreed to file a complaint was not a final agency decision, and therefore could be protected by\n\nExemption 5, because the decision did not mark the end of the case, but merely allowed the\n\nclaim to proceed in a judicial forum. Id. at 159–60.\n\n       Here, the Assessment is similar to the AAM that authorized the filing of an NLRA\n\ncomplaint: the Assessment does not mark the end of plaintiff’s asylum petition or subject him to\n\na final determination of his status that can only be challenged on appeal. Instead, it requires the\n\ncase to go forward to the immigration court for removal proceedings and a de novo\n\ndetermination of plaintiff’s asylum petition by that judge. Accordingly, the Court finds that the\n\nAssessment is not a document that is required to be disclosed under section 552(a)(2)(A) and\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\ftherefore that the section has no impact on defendant’s ability to invoke Exemption 5 to withhold\n\nthe Assessment in this case.\n\n       Plaintiff’s second argument – that, even if the Assessment was predecisional at one time,\n\nit lost that status when it was adopted as the position of the agency, Pl.’s Mot. at 20–21 – also\n\nfails. There is nothing in the record that supports the conclusion that the Assessment was\n\nadopted as the agency’s final decision. As an initial point, it does not automatically follow that\n\njust because USCIS rejected plaintiff’s request for asylum, it formally or informally adopted the\n\nAssessment as its final decision.7 Compare Am. Soc’y of Pension Actuaries v. IRS, 746 F. Supp.\n\n188, 191 (D.D.C. 1990) (“[T]he simple fact that an intra-agency deliberative memorandum\n\nreaches the same conclusion as the ultimate decision-maker provides no guarantee that the\n\nmemorandum represents the views actually adopted by the government.”); see also id. (noting\n\nthat certain documents that were deliberative were nonetheless available under FOIA because the\n\ngovernment adopted the $666 million dollar figure and “when . . . the government states a budget\n\nestimate with numerical specificity, the public is entitled to presume that a particular set of\n\ncalculations and assumptions underlie the estimate,” even if not specifically mentioned in the\n\nfinal order). The Referral Notice – which informed plaintiff of USCIS’s decision to deny his\n\nrequest – does not mention or incorporate the Assessment, see Referral Notice, and there is no\n\nevidence to show that, other than adopting the general recommendation to deny plaintiff’s\n\n\n7       For this reason, the Court is not persuaded by plaintiff’s argument that defendant’s\nstatement of material facts in dispute supports his contention that the Assessment is the final\ndecision of USCIS: “When this assessment was approved by [the AO’s supervisor, the\nsupervisor] initialed it, and it became USCIS’s decision that Abtew’s asylum application should\nbe addressed in [immigration [sic] court.” Pl.’s Opp. at 2, quoting Def.’s SOF ¶ 8. But the\nstatement quoted does not say that the Assessment was the final decision as plaintiff suggests;\ninstead, the statement provides that the recommendation to deny plaintiff’s asylum request,\nwhich is set forth in the Assessment, became the agency’s final decision, but not necessarily the\nunderlying reasons.\n\n\n                                               15\n\fasylum request at this stage, the agency adopted all of the reasons that the AO included in the\n\nAssessment.8 Cf. Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866 (citation omitted) (noting that the deliberative\n\nprocess privilege, among other things, is designed “to protect against confusing the issues and\n\nmisleading the public by dissemination of documents suggesting reasons and rationales for a\n\ncourse of action which were not in fact the ultimate reasons for the agency’s action”). Instead,\n\nthe Referral Notice provided its own explanation for the denial of plaintiff’s asylum request. See\n\nReferral Notice. As a result, the Assessment did not lose its protected status when USCIS issued\n\nthe Referral Notice.9 See Sears, 421 U.S. at 161 (emphasis added) (explaining that “if an agency\n\nchooses expressly to adopt or incorporate by reference an intra-agency memorandum previously\n\ncovered by Exemption 5 in what would otherwise be a final opinion,” the memorandum loses its\n\nprotected status under Exemption 5).\n\n       Furthermore, plaintiff’s reasoning that the Assessment was adopted as the official agency\n\nposition because it is now in the hands of the DHS lawyer who is responsible for representing the\n\ngovernment at plaintiff’s immigration proceeding is one step ahead of the facts. His argument is\n\npremised on a quotation taken from Coastal States: “[E]ven if the document is predecisional at\n\nthe time it is prepared, it can lose that status if it is adopted, formally or informally, as the agency\n\nposition on an issue or is used by the agency in its dealing with the public.” Pl.’s Mot. at 21,\n\n\n8     For this reason, Tax Analysts, 362 F. Supp. at 1303–05 (dealing with IRS letter rulings),\nand Badran v. DOJ, 652 F. Supp. 1437, 1439 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (addressing INS’s decision to set a\nbond amount), are distinguishable because the documents sought were expressly relied on in\nmaking the final agency decision in those cases.\n\n9       Plaintiff’s comparison of a NOID and an Assessment is unpersuasive. The NOID is\nissued to an asylum applicant who makes the request at the time he or she is still legally within\nthe country. It is a final decision, save the appeal process, and does not result in a de novo\nimmigration court proceeding. Put differently, the NOID itself is the agency’s final decision. As\na result, it would not be covered by the deliberative process privilege, making a comparison\nbetween it and an Assessment of limited value here.\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fquoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866. Plaintiff thus maintains that “[i]f the DHS uses a\n\ndocument in Immigration Court, the document is public.” Id. But the document has not been\n\nused in immigration court as of the date of this opinion, and the claim that it will be used in the\n\nfuture is speculative. A DHS lawyer is not required to introduce an Assessment at the removal\n\nproceeding.10 The Assessment therefore retains its predecisional and deliberative status, making\n\nit subject to the protections of the deliberative process privilege and permitting defendant to\n\nassert Exemption 5 to justify its withholding.\n\n   B. Plaintiff’s remaining arguments for why the Court should not allow defendant to\n      invoke FOIA Exemption 5 to withhold the Assessment are unpersuasive.\n\n       Plaintiff offers seven reasons why Exemption 5 cannot be invoked to withhold the\n\nAssessment in this case, but none of them alter the result.\n\n       First, plaintiff argues that documents that are routinely available through civil discovery\n\n“must also be disclosed under FOIA.” Pl.’s Mot. at 8; Pl.’s Opp. to Def.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Opp.”) at\n\n4 [Dkt. # 26]; Pl.’s Reply in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 5–6 [Dkt. # 25]. Although\n\nplaintiff is correct that “the parameters of Exemption 5 are determined by the reference to the\n\nprotections available to litigants in civil discovery,” Burka v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs., 87 F.3d 508, 516 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the deliberative process privilege protects against\n\ndisclosure of a document in civil discovery.11 As a result, the Court’s conclusion that the\n\ndeliberative process privilege applies to the Assessment forecloses this argument.\n\n\n\n10      Similarly, plaintiff’s argument that the government cannot argue that the Assessment is\nnot final here because it may later argue that the Assessment is authoritative and should carry\nweight in the immigration proceeding is unpersuasive. See Pl.’s Mot. at 12; Pl.’s Reply at 10. In\nany event, if the Assessment is expressly relied upon, it will be produced.\n\n11      Plaintiff cannot get around this conclusion by characterizing his FOIA request as one for\n“alleged ‘prior inconsistent statement’ or a transcript of a deposition,” Pl.’s Reply at 5, because it\nis not a verbatim transcript of plaintiff’s interview. See Eggleston Decl. ¶ 17.\n                                                 17\n\f       Plaintiff’s second argument is that 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b) blocks invocation of Exemption 5\n\nbecause that “statute compels the DHS to share the assessment with” plaintiff before it is offered\n\ninto evidence, and FOIA’s exemptions may not block a disclosure that is statutorily required.\n\nPl.’s Mot. at 9–10. But plaintiff’s argument is once more premature. Section 1229a(b)(4)(B)\n\nprovides that, at the immigration proceeding, an “alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to\n\nexamine the evidence against the alien.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B). Any “right” that attaches\n\nunder that section exists because the evidence is, or will be, introduced; it does not exist in the\n\nabstract because the government might introduce something. Section 1229a(b)(4)(B) therefore\n\nhas no relevance in deciding whether defendant may invoke Exemption 5.12\n\n       Plaintiff’s third argument fails for similar reasons. Plaintiff asserts that “[t]he DHS is\n\nplanning to use the Assessment in Immigration Court in the future; therefore it has waived\n\n\n\n12      In support of this argument, plaintiff directs the Court to DOJ v. Julian. 486 U.S. 1, 14\n(1988). In that case, the Supreme Court found that neither FOIA Exemption 3 nor 5 could be\ninvoked to prevent an individual from obtaining access to his presentence report: Exemption 3\ndid not apply because the two statutes cited as prohibiting disclosure of the presentence report\nactually required its disclosure to the defendant, save three categories of information; and\nExemption 5 did not apply be there was no recognized privilege against disclosure of a\npresentence report to the person that it was about. Id. at 7–14. That case is distinguishable on two\ngrounds. First, the Assessment is not withheld under Exemption 3, so discussion of whether\nanother statute prohibits or requires its disclosure is not relevant. But even if it were, as discussed\nabove, section 1229a(b)(4)(B) requires disclosure of “evidence against” the alien, which means\nthat, as a prerequisite to the invocation of that provision, evidence must have been offered at the\nimmigration proceeding. And second, as this Court found above, there is a privilege against\ndisclosure of the Assessment that justifies the invocation of Exemption 5 in this case. Section\n1229a(b)(4)(B)’s requirement is consistent with that finding because, to the extent that the\nAssessment is introduced into evidence and therefore triggers that section’s disclosure\nrequirement, defendant would have waived the privilege and its ability to invoke Exemption 5.\nPlaintiff’s reliance on Julian is therefore misplaced. Similarly, plaintiff cannot rely on the\ndiscussion in DOJ v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136 (1989), where the Supreme Court refused to\nimply a FOIA exemption on the ground that another statute governed the disclosure of the\ndocuments sought. See Pl.’s Reply at 6, quoting Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. at 154; see also Pl.’s\nOpp. at 16. Defendant does not justify its withholding in this case on the ground that section\n1229a(b)(4)(B) trumps FOIA; it argues that the deliberative process privilege protects that\ndocument under Exemption 5 unless and until that privilege is waived..\n                                                  18\n\fwhatever privilege may have attached.” Pl.’s Mot. at 10–16; Pl.’s Reply at 6–7. But it is\n\naxiomatic that a party does not waive a privilege by intending to take an action in the future;\n\nprivilege is waived only when that action is actually taken. As a result, plaintiff cannot rely on\n\nthe principle that voluntary disclosures may waive privileges because defendant has not made\n\nany voluntary disclosure or taken any action that would waive the deliberative process privilege\n\nat this time, and all of plaintiff’s arguments relating to defendant’s alleged waiver of the\n\nprivilege are cast in the future tense.13 See Pl.’s Mot. at 10 (“DHS states if the Assessment is\n\n\n\n\n13       For this reason, plaintiff’s argument that defendant cannot unilaterally use the\nAssessment and then claim the privilege must fail: Defendant has not yet attempted to use the\nAssessment against plaintiff in immigration court, see Pl.’s Mot. at 11 (“Defendant plans to use\nthe Assessment . . . .”), which makes the cases plaintiff relies on inapplicable. See United States\nv. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975) (calling an investigator to testify waived the privilege); Cottone\nv. Reno, 193 F.3d 550 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (permitting disclosure of tapes introduced at trial); In re\nGrand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175 (2d Cir. 1999) (questioning whether the disclosure of\nadvice from an attorney at a grand jury proceeding waived privilege); In re Martin Marietta\nCorp., 856 F.2d 619 (4th Cir. 1988) (finding that the corporation’s prior disclosure of privileged\nmaterial in settlement discussions waived the privilege and prevented its assertion in a later\ncase); In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d 94 (2d Cir. 1987) (involving disclosure of privileged\ninformation in book); In re Subpoenas Duces Tecum, 738 F.2d 1367 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (noting\nthat prior disclosure of privileged material prevented invocation of the privilege in later\nlitigation); Cooper v. U.S. Dep’t of Navy, 594 F.2d 484 (5th Cir. 1979) (same); Fidelity Nat’l\nFin. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., No. 9-0140, 2011 WL 13580, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 4, 2011)\n(finding no waiver when privileged material is shared with others as part of a joint strategy);\nNat’l Immigration Project of the Nat’l Lawyers Guild v. DHS, 842 F. Supp. 2d 720 (S.D.N.Y.\n2012) (noting that privilege is waived when the privileged material is referred to and relied on at\nthe appellate stage); SEC v. Lavin, 937 F. Supp. 23 (D.D.C. 1996), rev’d 111 F.3d 921 (D.C. Cir.\n1997) (finding waiver of the privilege where communications were knowingly taped, held by\nother entities, and never sought, but D.C. Circuit reversed); Fiumare v. Higgins, 572 F. Supp.\n1093 (D.N.H. 1983) (noting that prior disclosure of privileged material prevented invocation of\nthe privilege in later litigation); Cooper v. IRS, 450 F. Supp. 752 (D.D.C. 1977) (same).\n         And the other cases plaintiff relies on involve situations where previously privileged\ndocuments lose privileged status and protection under FOIA because they are incorporated into\nthe agency’s policy. See Nat’l Council of La Raza v. DOJ, 411 F.3d 350 (2d Cir. 2005)\n(permitting disclosure of a formerly privileged memorandum because repeated references to it\nled to tis incorporation into DOJ policy); Brennan Ctr. for Justice at NYU Sch. of Law v. DOJ,\nNo. 09-8756, 2011 WL 4001146, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2011), rev’d in part on other grounds\n697 F.3d 184 (2d Cir. 2012) (same). Incorporation of the Assessment did not occur in this case.\n                                                19\n\fused . . . ;” “if defendant argues . . . ;” “the Assessment will be given to plaintiff Mr. Abtew, in\n\nthe event it is used in court”) (emphasis added).\n\n       Plaintiff’s fourth argument is that defendant should be judicially estopped from asserting\n\nthe deliberative process privilege in this case because the government has consistently taken the\n\nposition before immigration courts that the Assessment can be a useful and valuable tool in\n\ndetermining the credibility of the asylum applicant. Pl.’s Mot. at 17–18; Pl.’s Reply at 7–9. This\n\nargument fails for the same reason the waiver claims are unavailing.\n\n       Judicial estoppel is an equitable rule that provides that “[w]here a party assumes a certain\n\nposition in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter,\n\nsimply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the\n\nprejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.”                  New\n\nHampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001), quoting Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689\n\n(1895). It is meant “to protect the integrity of the judicial process, by prohibiting parties from\n\ndeliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.” Id. at 749–50\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Those concerns are not present here: the fact\n\nthat DHS may choose to waive a privilege – or even regularly chooses to waive that privilege –\n\nis not inconsistent with maintaining the position that the material is privileged in the first place.\n\nA party should not be estopped from asserting a privilege initially just because it may later waive\n\nthat privilege if it finds it in its interest to do so. Here, defendant has not yet waived the privilege\n\nthat covers the Assessment, and what it may or may not do in the future does not operate as\n\nestoppel.\n\n       Plaintiff’s fifth argument echoes his judicial estoppel points: that an agency which is\n\ninconsistent is not entitled to deference by the courts. Pl.’s Mot. at 21–22; Pl.’s Reply at 10–11.\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fAs examples of defendant’s inconsistent positions, plaintiff states that (1) “DHS frequently\n\nprovided assessments to asylum applicants in the past,” (2) “DHS delivered the notes of the\n\nasylum officer to Mr. Abtew,” changing its position that the notes were exempt, and (3) DHS’s\n\ntraining manuals, that are included on its website, informs AOs that an asylum applicant “may\n\nsubmit a Freedom of Information Act [(FOIA)] request to obtain a copy of an assessment (and\n\nother information in the file).” Pl.’s Mot. at 21–23 (citations omitted); see also Pl.’s Opp. at 13;\n\nPl.’s Reply at 10–11. But plaintiff offers no evidence to support his first contention, and as the\n\nCourt has already noted, the fact that the Assessment may be revealed in litigation later does not\n\nbear upon the validity of the exemption.\n\n        Similarly, the training manuals that plaintiff cites do not support a conclusion that\n\ndefendant is being inconsistent in its position regarding the availability of the Assessment under\n\nFOIA. The training manuals alert AOs to the fact that an asylum applicant “may submit” a FOIA\n\nrequest to obtain the Assessment. They do not indicate that the request will be honored without\n\ncontest. Finally, it is not unusual for a party to modify its position in litigation. And if plaintiff\n\nhas concerns about defendant’s good faith, the Court has conducted its own in camera review of\n\nthe Assessment, and it finds no reason to disturb the agency’s characterization of the document\n\nas deliberative.14\n\n\n\n14      Plaintiff argues that notes of an AO and the Assessment are similar, and therefore if the\nnotes are not exempt, there is no reason to find the Assessment exempt. Pl.’s Opp. at 10–11, 13–\n14. But that logic does not add up. The notes a person takes during an interview do not\nnecessarily include the interviewer’s analysis or subjective opinion about the veracity or\nconsistency of what the interviewee is saying. The Assessment, on the other hand, includes that\ntype of subjective analysis, which is why the Court found it protected by the deliberative process\nprivilege. And to the extent that the Assessment includes facts that are also included in the notes\nthat have been disclosed, the Assessment can still be protected so long as the Court finds that the\nfacts in the Assessment are so interwoven with the subjective analysis of the AO that they are\nnecessarily deliberative in and of themselves. As described more fully below, the Court makes\nthat finding in this case.\n                                                 21\n\f       Plaintiff’s final two arguments are essentially policy arguments as to why the Court\n\nshould not allow defendant to invoke Exemption 5 in this case: that invocation of Exemption 5\n\nthreatens plaintiff’s rights under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b), Pl.’s Mot. at 23–26; Pl.’s Reply at 11, and\n\nthat the “integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full\n\ndisclosure of all the facts.” Pl.’s Mot. at 27–30.\n\n       Once again, any argument that plaintiff’s rights under section 1229a(b) are threatened by\n\nthe invocation of Exemption 5 is premature. Section 1229a(b)(4)(B) provides an alien with\n\n“reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him,” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B); it\n\ndoes not provide him with the right to obtain evidence that might be used against him in\n\nadvance.15   Similarly, plaintiff’s additional section 1229a(b) arguments about fundamental\n\n\n\n\n15      Singh v. Holder, 405 F. App’x 193 (9th Cir. 2010), Hernandez-Guadarrama v. Ashcroft,\n394 F.3d 674 (9th Cir. 2005), Al Khouri v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 461 (8th Cir. 2004), and Cunanan\nv. INS, 856 F.2d 1373 (9th Cir. 1988), are distinguishable on that ground. See Pl.’s Mot. at 24,\n26. Moreover, plaintiff’s consistent characterization of defendant’s statements to mean that\ndefendant will give the Assessment to plaintiff in the future misconstrues defendant’s pleadings.\nSee, e.g., Pl.’s Reply at 11 (“DHS agrees that 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b) gives rights to Abtew, and that\neventually, DHS shall give [the Assessment] to him. Why not give it to him now?”). Although\ndefendant acknowledges that section 1229a(b) gives plaintiff rights in his immigration\nproceeding that it must honor if it decides to use the Assessment, its acknowledgement that the\nAssessment will be provided is explicitly conditioned on a decision to actually use that\nAssessment in the proceeding. See Def.’s Mot. at 8; Def.’s SOF ¶ 14; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 11. That\ndecision has not yet been made. Def.’s Mot. at 7.\n\n\n                                                 22\n\ffairness do not negate the applicability of the FOIA exemption to a document that may not ever\n\nbe introduced at the immigration proceeding.16\n\n       The Court recognizes the importance of the civil and criminal discovery mechanisms that\n\nplaintiff itemizes in his pleadings, see Pl.’s Mot. at 27–30; Pl.’s Reply at 12, but he will be\n\nafforded due process and discovery rights at the immigration hearing, including, if appropriate, a\n\nright to the Assessment under section 1229a(b)(4)(B). The analogy to civil discovery rules is\n\ninapposite since a work product privilege is recognized in that context as well, and the\n\nprotections plaintiff lists that are offered to a criminal defendant arise in the context of an\n\nindictment and subsequent trial – not in advance of the initiation of court proceedings.17\n\n\n\n\n16      Plaintiff cites Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365 (9th Cir. 2010) in support of his contention\nthat fundamental fairness requires defendant to release the Assessment now. Pl.’s Mot. at 25.\nBut Dent is distinguishable from this case because it involved a different provision of Title 8,\nwhich provides an alien with the right to “access . . . the alien’s visa or other entry document, if\nany, and any other records and documents not considered by the Attorney General to be\nconfidential, pertaining to the alien’s admission or presence in the United States.” 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229a(c)(2)(B). Moreover, the fundamental fairness discussions in Al Khouri, 362 F.3d at 464,\nand Hernandez-Guadarrama, 394 F.3d at 682, have no relevance in this case because any injury\nresulting to plaintiff from not permitting him enough time to review evidence or cross-examine\nwitnesses against him to ensure fairness at his immigration proceeding is speculative at this time.\nSee Singh, 405 F. App’x at 193 (noting that an alien may obtain a continuance, if needed, to\nreview evidence presented against him at an immigration proceeding).\n\n17    Moreover, plaintiff is incorrect about the scope of discovery in the criminal context: for\nexample, grand jury witnesses do not automatically get transcripts of their testimony.\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f         As a result, the Court is unpersuaded by plaintiff’s arguments that defendant cannot\n\ninvoke Exemption 5 as a justification for withholding the deliberative portions of the\n\nAssessment.18\n\n   II.      There are reasonably segregable portions of the Assessment that defendant must\n            disclose.\n\n         Plaintiff argues in the alternative that, even if the document is properly withheld, the\n\nsegregable facts contained in it are not deliberative and must be disclosed to him. Pl.’s Reply at\n\n12–14. Defendant states that the facts included in the Assessment are so interwoven with the\n\ndeliberative portions of that document that they cannot be reasonably segregated and are\n\ntherefore properly withheld. Def.’s Mot. at 4–5; Eggleston Decl. ¶ 17. The Court ordered\n\nproduction of the Assessment for in camera review in order to resolve this dispute. Apr. 29,\n\n2014 Minute Entry.\n\n         Under FOIA, “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any\n\nperson requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b). This Circuit has held that any “non-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed\n\nunless they are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\n\n         After reviewing the Assessment in camera, the Court concludes that the first six\n\nparagraphs simply recite and summarize the facts that plaintiff presented to the AO during his\n\n\n18      The Court notes, though, that this case presents a unique situation where the document at\nissue may have significant repercussions for plaintiff if it is used at his immigration proceeding.\nBased on the potential significant impact that the document may have on plaintiff’s immigration\nstatus, as well as the strong likelihood that the Assessment will be introduced at plaintiff’s\nimmigration proceeding and that such use would in fact waive the deliberative process privilege\nwhile simultaneously triggering the protection afforded to plaintiff by section 1229a(b)(4)(B),\nthe Court encourages defendant to not delay in providing the Assessment to plaintiff if it\nultimately decides it will be used in the immigration proceeding.\n\n                                                24\n\fasylum application interview. Those paragraphs do not include any analysis or impressions, and\n\nthey do not reflect the AO’s deliberative process: although the document does not purport to be\n\na verbatim rendition of the interview, and there may have been some streamlining involved, the\n\nsummary does not involve the sort of culling of facts from a large universe that could be\n\ncharacterized as deliberative. See Ancient Coin Collection Guild v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 641 F.3d\n\n504, 513 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (noting that factual summaries may reflect the predecisional,\n\ndeliberative process where they indicate “an exercise of judgment as to what issues are most\n\nrelevant to the pre-decisional findings and recommendations”). The paragraphs are therefore not\n\nprotected by Exemption 5, and they are easily segregated from the privileged portions of the\n\nAssessment that follow. So, the first six paragraphs of the document must be disclosed to\n\nplaintiff.\n\n           The remaining portions of the Assessment, however, are properly withheld under\n\nExemption 5. Any facts contained in those paragraphs are interwoven with the AO’s reasoning\n\nand recommended disposition, and they cannot be reasonably segregated from the privileged\n\nmaterial. Thus, defendant may continue to withhold the remaining portions of the Assessment\n\nunder Exemption 5.\n\n    III.      Plaintiff’s claim that defendant’s failure to disclose the Assessment violates 8\n              U.S.C. § 1229a(b) is not ripe.\n           Count III of the complaint requests that this Court find that defendant violated plaintiff’s\n\nrights under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B) by failing to provide him with a copy of the Assessment.\n\nThe parties disagree as to whether that section creates a private cause of action, Def.’s Mot. at 7;\n\nPl.’s Opp. at 16, and defendant also asserts that this count should be dismissed as premature.\n\nDef.’s Mot. at 1. Because this claim is not ripe, it will be dismissed, and the Court need not\n\nreach the issue of whether plaintiff has a private cause of action under section 1229a.\n\n\n                                                   25\n\f       Ripeness is a two-pronged inquiry: first, courts consider “the ‘fitness of the issues for\n\njudicial decision,’” and second, they consider “the extent to which withholding a decision will\n\ncause ‘hardship to the parties.’” Am. Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 683 F.3d 382, 387 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2012), quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967). Here, plaintiff’s rights under\n\nsection 1229a(b)(4)(B) are not “fit for judicial decision” because, as indicated above, they have\n\nnot yet been triggered. Defendant has not yet sought to introduce the Assessment as evidence\n\nagainst plaintiff at the immigration proceeding or even indicated that it will do so. And it is\n\nentirely speculative that plaintiff will suffer any harm because he has to wait; at this point, we do\n\nnot know whether plaintiff will be entitled to review the document, and how much time he will\n\nbe given if he is. As a result, the Court finds that Count III of the complaint is not ripe and\n\nshould be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the Assessment is covered by the deliberative process privilege and because that\n\nprivilege has not been waived as of the date of this opinion, the Court finds that defendant\n\nproperly withheld the document under FOIA Exemption 5. But it also finds that the first six\n\nparagraphs of the document are not deliberative and that they are reasonably segregable from any\n\nprotected information, so defendant must therefore release those paragraphs to plaintiff. The\n\nCourt will therefore grant defendant’s motion for summary judgment in part and deny it in part,\n\nwhile also granting plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in part and denying it in part with\n\nrespect to Count II.\n\n       Additionally, the Court finds that Count III of the complaint is premature because the\n\nrights plaintiff seeks to protect have not yet been triggered. As a result, the Court will dismiss\n\nCount III on ripeness grounds. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                             AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                             United States District Judge\n\nDATE: June 13, 2014\n\n\n\n\n                                               27\n\f",

Id. ¶¶ c, f.\n\n       During the pendency of the case, defendant released the asylum officer’s notes to the\n\nplaintiff, rendering Count I moot.

J. & Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. (“Def.’s Mot.”) [Dkt. # 23]. After a review\n\nof the Assessment in camera, the Court finds that the Assessment is protected by the deliberative\n\nprocess privilege and that the privilege has not been waived. It also finds, however, that the\n\ninitial factual recitation contained in the first six paragraphs is not deliberative and is reasonably\n\fsegregable from the deliberative portion of the document. As a result, the Court will grant\n\ndefendant’s motion for summary judgment in part and deny it in part, and it will grant plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment in part and denying it in part with respect to Count II. The Court\n\nwill also dismiss Count III because it is not ripe.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n   I.      LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n   A. The asylum application process.\n\n        Individuals seeking asylum in the United States may file an application for asylum with\n\nthe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), which is a component of the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Def.’s Statement of Material Facts as to which\n\nthere is no Genuine Dispute (“Def.’s SOF”) ¶ 4 [Dkt. # 23]. USCIS then reviews the application\n\nand decides whether it should be granted or denied. If the application is granted, the individual\n\nis permitted to stay in the United States.        If USCIS determines that it cannot grant the\n\napplication, it will notify the individual of that decision, and what happens next depends on\n\nwhether the applicant was legally (“in-status”) or illegally (“out-of-status”) in the United States\n\nat the time the asylum application was filed. Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 2, 6.\n\n        Asylum applicants who are in-status are sent what is called a Notice of Intent to Deny\n\n(“NOID”). Id. ¶ 16. The NOID explains that USCIS cannot approve the asylum application, and\n\nit notifies the applicant that he or she has sixteen days to respond to the NOID by submitting\n\nadditional information and supporting documents. Id. ¶¶ 17–18; Pl.’s Statement of Material\n\nFacts not in Dispute (“Pl.’s SOF”) ¶ 15 [Dkt. # 18]. If, after the submission of additional\n\nmaterial, USCIS continues to believe the asylum application should be denied, the asylum officer\n\n(“AO”) assigned to the case (subject to approval by the Supervisory AO) will advise the alien\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fthat the application has been denied. Def.’s SOF ¶ 19. An in-status alien whose application has\n\nbeen denied does not have any right to further review of the denial. Id. ¶ 20.\n\n       If the applicant is out-of-status, on the other hand, the AO prepares what is called an\n\n“Assessment to Refer” (“Assessment”) instead of a NOID. The Assessment includes the AO’s\n\nrecommendation that the application be denied and that the out-of-status applicant be referred to\n\nthe immigration court for removal proceedings.        Def.’s SOF ¶ 8; Pl.’s SOF ¶¶ 2–5. The\n\nAssessment also includes the reasoning underlying the AO’s recommendation. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 8.\n\n       After the AO drafts the Assessment, the Supervisory AO reviews and initials the\n\ndocument. Def.’s SOF ¶ 8; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 2. The Assessment is then placed in the asylum\n\napplicant’s file, and the file is transferred to the DHS lawyer who will represent the government\n\nat the immigration court proceeding. Def.’s SOF ¶ 9; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 4. The Assessment is not\n\nprovided to the asylum applicant. Def.’s SOF ¶ 9. Instead, USCIS generates a Referral Notice,\n\nwhich informs the out-of-status applicant that USCIS cannot grant the asylum request and that\n\nthe case was referred to the immigration court. Id. ¶ 10; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 5. The Referral Notice also\n\ninforms the applicant of the reasons for the denial of the application and of the right to renew the\n\nasylum request before the immigration court, which will conduct a de novo review. Def.’s SOF\n\n¶ 12. If the immigration judge denies the asylum application, the alien can appeal that decision\n\nto the Board of Immigration Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals. Id. ¶ 15.\n\n       At the de novo immigration proceeding before the immigration court, the alien’s statutory\n\nrights are governed by 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. Among those rights, and most pertinent to this case, is\n\nthe requirement that “the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence\n\nagainst the alien, to present evidence on the alien’s own behalf, and to cross examine witnesses\n\npresented by the Government.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B).\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f         A DHS lawyer may – but is not required to – present the Assessment prepared by the AO\n\nas evidence at the immigration proceeding. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 10; Def.’s SOF ¶ 14. If the lawyer elects\n\nto do so, then section 1229a(b)(4)(B) requires that the alien be accorded a reasonable opportunity\n\nto examine the Assessment. Def.’s SOF ¶ 14.\n\n   II.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n         Plaintiff Anteneh Abtew is a native and citizen of Ethiopia. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 1. On February\n\n17, 2012, he arrived in the United States on a tourist visa, which has since expired. Id.; Def.’s\n\nSOF ¶ 3. He applied for asylum in the United States with USCIS as an out-of-status applicant,1\n\nand on October 9, 2012, an AO in the Arlington Asylum Office interviewed him about his\n\napplication. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 1. During the interview, the AO and plaintiff communicated through an\n\ninterpreter, and the AO took notes. Id.\n\n         After the interview, the AO prepared a four-page Assessment. Id. ¶¶ 2–3; Def’s SOF ¶ 6.\n\nThe Assessment memorialized the AO’s recommendation that plaintiff’s asylum application\n\nshould be denied, and after review, the AO’s supervisor initialed it. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 2; Def.’s SOF\n\n¶¶ 6–7. The Assessment was then placed into plaintiff’s file, and that file was transferred to the\n\nDHS lawyer who will represent the United States at plaintiff’s immigration proceeding. Pl.’s\n\nSOF ¶ 4; Def.’s SOF ¶ 9. Plaintiff was not provided a copy of the Assessment. Def.’s SOF ¶ 9.\n\n         USCIS then generated a Referral Notice, informing plaintiff of USCIS’s decision. The\n\nReferral Notice stated that USCIS reached its decision because of “[m]aterial inconsistency(ies)\n\nbetween     [plaintiff’s]   testimony and   application   and/or   other   evidence[,]   [m]aterial\n\ninconsistency(ies) within [plaintiff’s] testimony[,] [and] [l]ack of detail(s) on material points.”\n\n\n\n1      Because plaintiff’s visa expired prior to the filing of his application for asylum, he is\nconsidered an out-of-status applicant.\n\n                                                4\n\fReferral Notice, Ex. E to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. (“Referral Notice”) [Dkt.\n\n# 23-1]; see also Pl.’s SOF ¶ 5; Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 10–11. It also informed plaintiff of the next steps\n\nin the process: that the asylum case would be referred to an immigration judge for further\n\nproceedings, that the referral is not a denial of the asylum application, and that USCIS’s initial\n\ndecision to deny the petition is not binding on the immigration judge, who will conduct a de novo\n\nreview of plaintiff’s request. Referral Notice; see also Def.’s SOF ¶ 12. Plaintiff’s immigration\n\ncourt proceeding is scheduled for February 18, 2015. Pl.’s SOF ¶ 9.\n\n       On November 11, 2012, plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to obtain a copy of the\n\nAssessment as well as the notes the AO took during plaintiff’s interview. Pl.’s FOIA Request,\n\nEx. A to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. [Dkt. # 23-1]. In response, defendant\n\nproduced ninety-two pages in their entirety and five pages in part, while withholding twenty-\n\nthree pages in full under FOIA Exemptions 5, 6, 7C, and 7E. Resp. to Pl.’s FOIA Request, Ex. C\n\nto Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. [Dkt. # 23-1].           Plaintiff appealed the\n\nwithholdings, Pl.’s FOIA Appeal, Ex. D to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. [Dkt.\n\n# 23-1], and that appeal was denied. Appeal Denial Letter, Ex. E to Decl. of Jill Eggleston, Ex.\n\nA to Def.’s Mot.

And second, the\n\nCourt must decide whether the withholding of the Assessment violates plaintiff’s rights under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B) (Count III).\n\n   I.      Exemption 5 covers the Assessment in this case.\n\n        FOIA Exemption 5 bars disclosure of “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or\n\nletters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the\n\nagency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). A document may be properly withheld under Exemption 5 only\n\nif it satisfies “two conditions: its source must be a [g]overnment agency, and it must fall within\n\nthe ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation\n\nagainst the agency that holds it.” U.S. Dep’t of Interior v.

Def.’s Mot. at 5.\n\nPlaintiff advances nine arguments as to why Exemption 5 cannot be invoked in this case. Pl.’s\n\nMot. at 8–30. These arguments can be organized into two categories: (A) those that claim that\n\nthe deliberative process privilege, and therefore Exemption 5, do not cover the Assessment; and\n                                                 7\n\f(B) those that posit that even if the Assessment is covered by the deliberative process privilege,\n\ndefendant still cannot invoke Exemption 5 to justify its withholding the Assessment.2            Id.\n\nNeither category of arguments withstands scrutiny.\n\n   A. The Assessment falls within Exemption 5 because it is protected by the deliberative\n      process privilege.\n\n       “The deliberative process privilege rests on the obvious realization that officials will not\n\ncommunicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery,” and its\n\npurpose “is to enhance ‘the quality of agency decisions’ by protecting open and frank discussion\n\namong those who make them within the [g]overnment.” Klamath, 532 U.S. at 8–9 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).

This Circuit has held that “a document [is] predecisional if ‘it was generated before the\n\nadoption of an agency policy’ and deliberative if ‘it reflects the give-and-take of the consultative\n\nprocess.’” Judicial Watch, 449 F.3d at 151, quoting Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

Cir. 1981).\n\n\n2       Plaintiff does not contest that the Assessment satisfies the first condition of Exemption 5\n– that the document withheld be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter. See\nPl.’s Mot. at 8–30. As a result, the Court finds that requirement is satisfied in this case.\n                                                 8\n\f        Applying that framework here, the Court finds that the Assessment is predecisional and\n\ndeliberative, and that it therefore falls under the deliberative process privilege. In a declaration\n\nsubmitted along with defendant’s cross-motion for summary judgment, Jill A. Eggleston – the\n\nAssistant Center Director in the FOIA and Privacy Act Unit, National Records Center, USCIS –\n\nexplains that the Assessment at issue in this case is a document that “predates USCIS’s decision\n\nto not grant asylum to the Plaintiff,” and that “[t]he document forms the basis for the decision to\n\nnot grant the Plaintiff asylum and instead refer him to an immigration judge for removal\n\nproceedings.” Decl. of Jill A. Eggleston (“Eggleston Decl.”), Ex. A to Def.’s Mot. ¶¶ 1, 17 [Dkt.\n\n# 23-1].3 She also explains that the AO writes the Assessment “in narrative form, and explains\n\nthe officer’s concerns, discusses possible legal insufficiencies in the application, and the reasons\n\nfor the decision to refer the case to the immigration court,” which makes it an “essential part of\n\nthe USCIS deliberative process that leads to the ultimate determination to deny an alien’s\n\napplication for asylum” and to instead refer the out-of-status applicant for removal proceedings.\n\nId. ¶ 17.\n\n        In other words, the Eggleston declaration verifies that the AO writes the Assessment\n\nbefore a final decision is made; that the Assessment is an essential tool in making that decision;\n\n\n\n3       Plaintiff argues that the Court cannot rely on the Eggleston Declaration because\nEggleston did not state that she has any personal knowledge of the procedures inside an asylum\noffice or that she read the Assessment in this case. Pl.’s Opp. to Def.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Opp.”) at 4\n[Dkt. # 26]. But as another court in this district previously explained, the “extent of Eggleston’s\nknowledge of the asylum process is largely irrelevant. What matters is her capacity to explain\nthe legal basis for the defendant’s withholding of the assessment under the FOIA.” Anguimate v.\nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (D.D.C. 2013). Moreover, the last\nparagraph of the declaration explains that the Assessment is fully described in the declaration,\nthat she is familiar with the matters described in the declaration, and that she can “attest to the\naccuracy of the document descriptions and applicability of the FOIA exemptions asserted.”\nEggleston Decl. ¶ 20. This is sufficient for the Court to be able to rely on the declaration. See\nAnguimate, 918 F. Supp. 2d at 19.\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fand that the Assessment includes the AO’s personal thoughts about the merits of the asylum\n\ncase. It is therefore both predecisional and deliberative, bringing it under the protection of the\n\ndeliberative process privilege.4 See Abramyan v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 12-1064,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6247338</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (D.D.C. Dec. 4, 2013) (holding that the Assessment to Refer in that\n\n\n\n\n4        Plaintiff argues that the Assessment is not deliberative because it does not reflect the\ngive-and-take of the consultative process, since the AO writes the document on his or her own.\nPl.’s Opp. at 4–5, 11–12. But this is an overly narrow view of what can be part of the\ndeliberative process. The Assessment transmits the AO’s thoughts to a supervisory official and\nit is a step leading to the issuance of a decision; just because it includes the “give,” but not the\n“take,” does not take it outside the scope of the conversation. And as plaintiff acknowledges,\nprotecting the give-and-take of the consultative process is only one of the reasons for the\nprivilege, and a document is considered deliberative if it includes recommendations for how a\ndecision should be made, which the Assessment does. See Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866.\n         Similarly, plaintiff’s argument that deliberative process privilege should not apply to this\ncase because the frequent disclosure of Assessments in immigration courts cuts against the need\nto protect the internal discussions of AO officers also fails. Pl.’s Opp. at 5, 12–13; Pl.’s Reply in\nSupp. of Pl.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 1, 3, 16 [Dkt. # 25]. Putting aside the realization that just\nbecause a privilege is waived in one context does not mean that it is less important in another\ncontext, the Court cannot force disclosure under FOIA on this ground alone. As another court in\nthis district has recognized, the D.C. Circuit has instructed district courts not “to ‘second-guess\n. . . congressional judgment’” that a document is subject to the protections of the deliberative\nprocess privilege “‘on a case-by-case basis’; rather, once it is determined that the two elements\nof the deliberative process privilege are satisfied, the judicial inquiry is complete.” Anguimate,\n918 F. Supp. 2d at 20, quoting McKinley, 647 F.3d at 339.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fcase was both predecisional and deliberative); Anguimate v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 918 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 13, 18–21 (D.D.C. 2013) (same).5\n\n       Plaintiff’s arguments do not alter that conclusion. First, he argues that the Assessment is\n\na final, post-decision document because it was initialed by the Supervisory AO and sent to a\n\nDHS lawyer who would represent the government in plaintiff’s removal proceeding before the\n\nimmigration court. Thus, he contends that the Assessment is the document that “disposes” of\n\nplaintiff’s request for asylum to the extent that it is before USCIS. Pl.’s Mot. at 18–19. But the\n\ndocument cannot be postdecisional in the literal sense of the word because the AO drafted it\n\nbefore the final decision was made, and the requirement that the Supervisory AO review the\n\nAssessment does not somehow transform it into a “final agency” decision just because the\n\nsupervisor initialed it; the Supervisory AO’s initials are not just a “rubber stamp.”             See\n\nAbramyan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6247338</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. Moreover, the Assessment does not actually “dispose” of\n\nplaintiff’s asylum petition.   It is the Decision Letter – in this case, the Referral Notice – that\n\n\n\n\n5       Plaintiff argues that Anguimate and Abramyan are distinguishable because at the time the\ncourts found that the Assessments at issue in those cases were protected by the deliberative\nprocess privilege and therefore properly withheld under Exemption 5, the plaintiffs in those cases\nhad already been granted asylum by the immigration court. Pl.’s Mot. at 9–10; Pl.’s Opp. at 9–\n11. But that procedural posture does not distinguish the legal question in those cases from the\none in front of this Court: although in Anguimate and Abramyan the procedural posture\nguaranteed that the government would not later introduce the Assessment before the immigration\ncourt, the government has not yet used – and may ultimately decide not to use – the Assessment\nat issue here in plaintiff’s immigration proceeding. As a result, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a has not been\nimplicated as of the date of the decision of this case and, despite plaintiff’s arguments to the\ncontrary, defendant has not adopted the Assessment as its final decision. The Court therefore\nfinds the cases to be persuasive in resolving plaintiff’s claims in this case. Indeed, the distinction\nindicates that plaintiff may very well receive a copy of the Assessment in the future without any\naction by this Court.\n                                                 11\n\fofficially disposes of the asylum petition on behalf of USCIS.6 Eggleston Decl. ¶ 17 (“The\n\nAgency’s final decision is the Referral Notice, which is signed by the [Supervisory AO] for the\n\nDirector of Asylum Office.”).\n\n       The cases plaintiff relies on to support his point that the Assessment is the final decision\n\nthat disposes of the case do not support his position. See Pl.’s Mot. at 18–20. It is true that the\n\nSupreme Court has held that Exemption 5 cannot be invoked to withhold documents that must be\n\ndisclosed under section 552(a)(2)(A), see NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109241\"><a href=\"/opinion/109241/nlrb-v-sears-roebuck-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975),\n\nbecause they are “final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders,\n\nmade in the adjudication of cases.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)(A); see also Pl.’s Mot. at 18–20.

Pl.’s Opp. at 2–\n3; Pl.’s Reply at 10. But what constitutes a “final decision” is not a factual question; it a legal\none that can be properly decided by this Court. And the evidence before this Court indicates that\nthe Referral Notice is the final decision, not the Assessment. The Referral Notice was written\nafter USCIS made the final decision to deny plaintiff’s request, and it notified plaintiff of that\ndecision and his appeal rights.            The Assessment, on the other hand, contains the\nrecommendations of an AO on what the final decision about plaintiff’s asylum request should be,\nit was written before the final decision was made, and – as discussed more below – it was not\nadopted as or incorporated into USCIS’s final decision. Accordingly, the Court finds that the\nReferral Notice was the final decision in this case. This conclusion is not altered just because the\nReferral Notice is created “by checking boxes on a computer.” Pl.’s Opp. at 5.\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fLiberties Union Found., Inc. v.

See Schlefer v.

The documents were\n\nprepared by higher-level officials and created the internal agency “law” that guided the decision-\n\nmaking process of lower-level officials. But a recommendation that an asylum petition be\n\ndenied does not set out “law” for AOs to apply in future cases or an interpretation of an\n\nambiguous statutory provision. It is a recommendation as to how USCIS should proceed with a\n\nparticular application, and therefore there is no concern in this case that the agency is developing\n\n“secret law” that it is trying to hide from the public. Compare Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 868\n\n(explaining that the documents at issue in that case were not protected by the deliberative process\n\nprivilege because they were “not advice to a superior, nor [were] they suggested dispositions of a\n\ncase,” and instead they were “akin to a ‘resource’ opinion about the applicability of existing\n\npolicy to a certain state of facts, like examples in a manual, to be contrasted to a factual or\n\nstrategic advice giving opinion”). Furthermore, the Assessment is not a higher-level official\n\ntelling a lower-level official how to exercise his or her discretion: it is a recommendation that\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fflows from the lower-level employee to a higher-level official.

Sears, Roebuck & Co. – the case\n\nthat established the rule that Exemption 5 cannot justify withholding documents that must be\n\nreleased under section 552(a)(2)(A) – actually supports the continued withholding of the\n\nAssessment under Exemption 5 in this case. In Sears, the Supreme Court addressed whether an\n\nAdvice and Appeals Memorandum (“AAM”) issued by the General Counsel of the National\n\nLabor Relations Board (“NLRB”) regarding whether he would file a complaint based on a\n\nprivate party’s report of a potential NLRA violation could be withheld as an intra-agency\n\nmemorandum under Exemption 5 or whether it was a “final opinion” as defined in 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(2)(A). 421 U.S. at 136. The Court held that an AAM that memorialized the decision to\n\nnot file a complaint was a final agency opinion because it adjudicated the potential issue and\n\nforeclosed any potential judicial proceedings unless the party seeking legal action successfully\n\nappealed the General Counsel’s decision. Id. at 155–59. But the Court found that an AAM that\n\nagreed to file a complaint was not a final agency decision, and therefore could be protected by\n\nExemption 5, because the decision did not mark the end of the case, but merely allowed the\n\nclaim to proceed in a judicial forum. Id. at 159–60.\n\n       Here, the Assessment is similar to the AAM that authorized the filing of an NLRA\n\ncomplaint: the Assessment does not mark the end of plaintiff’s asylum petition or subject him to\n\na final determination of his status that can only be challenged on appeal. Instead, it requires the\n\ncase to go forward to the immigration court for removal proceedings and a de novo\n\ndetermination of plaintiff’s asylum petition by that judge. Accordingly, the Court finds that the\n\nAssessment is not a document that is required to be disclosed under section 552(a)(2)(A) and\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\ftherefore that the section has no impact on defendant’s ability to invoke Exemption 5 to withhold\n\nthe Assessment in this case.\n\n       Plaintiff’s second argument – that, even if the Assessment was predecisional at one time,\n\nit lost that status when it was adopted as the position of the agency, Pl.’s Mot. at 20–21 – also\n\nfails. There is nothing in the record that supports the conclusion that the Assessment was\n\nadopted as the agency’s final decision. As an initial point, it does not automatically follow that\n\njust because USCIS rejected plaintiff’s request for asylum, it formally or informally adopted the\n\nAssessment as its final decision.7 Compare Am.

The Referral Notice – which informed plaintiff of USCIS’s decision to deny his\n\nrequest – does not mention or incorporate the Assessment, see Referral Notice, and there is no\n\nevidence to show that, other than adopting the general recommendation to deny plaintiff’s\n\n\n7       For this reason, the Court is not persuaded by plaintiff’s argument that defendant’s\nstatement of material facts in dispute supports his contention that the Assessment is the final\ndecision of USCIS: “When this assessment was approved by [the AO’s supervisor, the\nsupervisor] initialed it, and it became USCIS’s decision that Abtew’s asylum application should\nbe addressed in [immigration [sic] court.” Pl.’s Opp. at 2, quoting Def.’s SOF ¶ 8. But the\nstatement quoted does not say that the Assessment was the final decision as plaintiff suggests;\ninstead, the statement provides that the recommendation to deny plaintiff’s asylum request,\nwhich is set forth in the Assessment, became the agency’s final decision, but not necessarily the\nunderlying reasons.\n\n\n                                               15\n\fasylum request at this stage, the agency adopted all of the reasons that the AO included in the\n\nAssessment.8 Cf. Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866 (citation omitted) (noting that the deliberative\n\nprocess privilege, among other things, is designed “to protect against confusing the issues and\n\nmisleading the public by dissemination of documents suggesting reasons and rationales for a\n\ncourse of action which were not in fact the ultimate reasons for the agency’s action”). Instead,\n\nthe Referral Notice provided its own explanation for the denial of plaintiff’s asylum request. See\n\nReferral Notice. As a result, the Assessment did not lose its protected status when USCIS issued\n\nthe Referral Notice.9 See Sears, 421 U.S. at 161 (emphasis added) (explaining that “if an agency\n\nchooses expressly to adopt or incorporate by reference an intra-agency memorandum previously\n\ncovered by Exemption 5 in what would otherwise be a final opinion,” the memorandum loses its\n\nprotected status under Exemption 5).\n\n       Furthermore, plaintiff’s reasoning that the Assessment was adopted as the official agency\n\nposition because it is now in the hands of the DHS lawyer who is responsible for representing the\n\ngovernment at plaintiff’s immigration proceeding is one step ahead of the facts. His argument is\n\npremised on a quotation taken from Coastal States: “[E]ven if the document is predecisional at\n\nthe time it is prepared, it can lose that status if it is adopted, formally or informally, as the agency\n\nposition on an issue or is used by the agency in its dealing with the public.” Pl.’s Mot. at 21,\n\n\n8     For this reason, Tax Analysts, 362 F.

Ill. 1987) (addressing INS’s decision to set a\nbond amount), are distinguishable because the documents sought were expressly relied on in\nmaking the final agency decision in those cases.\n\n9       Plaintiff’s comparison of a NOID and an Assessment is unpersuasive. The NOID is\nissued to an asylum applicant who makes the request at the time he or she is still legally within\nthe country. It is a final decision, save the appeal process, and does not result in a de novo\nimmigration court proceeding. Put differently, the NOID itself is the agency’s final decision. As\na result, it would not be covered by the deliberative process privilege, making a comparison\nbetween it and an Assessment of limited value here.\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fquoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866. Plaintiff thus maintains that “[i]f the DHS uses a\n\ndocument in Immigration Court, the document is public.” Id. But the document has not been\n\nused in immigration court as of the date of this opinion, and the claim that it will be used in the\n\nfuture is speculative. A DHS lawyer is not required to introduce an Assessment at the removal\n\nproceeding.10 The Assessment therefore retains its predecisional and deliberative status, making\n\nit subject to the protections of the deliberative process privilege and permitting defendant to\n\nassert Exemption 5 to justify its withholding.\n\n   B. Plaintiff’s remaining arguments for why the Court should not allow defendant to\n      invoke FOIA Exemption 5 to withhold the Assessment are unpersuasive.\n\n       Plaintiff offers seven reasons why Exemption 5 cannot be invoked to withhold the\n\nAssessment in this case, but none of them alter the result.\n\n       First, plaintiff argues that documents that are routinely available through civil discovery\n\n“must also be disclosed under FOIA.” Pl.’s Mot. at 8; Pl.’s Opp. to Def.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Opp.”) at\n\n4 [Dkt. # 26]; Pl.’s Reply in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 5–6 [Dkt. # 25]. Although\n\nplaintiff is correct that “the parameters of Exemption 5 are determined by the reference to the\n\nprotections available to litigants in civil discovery,” Burka v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720631\"><a href=\"/opinion/720631/robert-a-burka-v-united-states-department-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the deliberative process privilege protects against\n\ndisclosure of a document in civil discovery.11 As a result, the Court’s conclusion that the\n\ndeliberative process privilege applies to the Assessment forecloses this argument.\n\n\n\n10      Similarly, plaintiff’s argument that the government cannot argue that the Assessment is\nnot final here because it may later argue that the Assessment is authoritative and should carry\nweight in the immigration proceeding is unpersuasive. See Pl.’s Mot. at 12; Pl.’s Reply at 10. In\nany event, if the Assessment is expressly relied upon, it will be produced.\n\n11      Plaintiff cannot get around this conclusion by characterizing his FOIA request as one for\n“alleged ‘prior inconsistent statement’ or a transcript of a deposition,” Pl.’s Reply at 5, because it\nis not a verbatim transcript of plaintiff’s interview. See Eggleston Decl. ¶ 17.\n                                                 17\n\f       Plaintiff’s second argument is that 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b) blocks invocation of Exemption 5\n\nbecause that “statute compels the DHS to share the assessment with” plaintiff before it is offered\n\ninto evidence, and FOIA’s exemptions may not block a disclosure that is statutorily required.\n\nPl.’s Mot. at 9–10. But plaintiff’s argument is once more premature. Section 1229a(b)(4)(B)\n\nprovides that, at the immigration proceeding, an “alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to\n\nexamine the evidence against the alien.” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B). Any “right” that attaches\n\nunder that section exists because the evidence is, or will be, introduced; it does not exist in the\n\nabstract because the government might introduce something. Section 1229a(b)(4)(B) therefore\n\nhas no relevance in deciding whether defendant may invoke Exemption 5.12\n\n       Plaintiff’s third argument fails for similar reasons. Plaintiff asserts that “[t]he DHS is\n\nplanning to use the Assessment in Immigration Court in the future; therefore it has waived\n\n\n\n12      In support of this argument, plaintiff directs the Court to DOJ v. Julian. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112065\"><a href=\"/opinion/112065/department-of-justice-v-julian/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14\n(1988). In that case, the Supreme Court found that neither FOIA Exemption 3 nor 5 could be\ninvoked to prevent an individual from obtaining access to his presentence report: Exemption 3\ndid not apply because the two statutes cited as prohibiting disclosure of the presentence report\nactually required its disclosure to the defendant, save three categories of information; and\nExemption 5 did not apply be there was no recognized privilege against disclosure of a\npresentence report to the person that it was about. Id. at 7–14. That case is distinguishable on two\ngrounds. First, the Assessment is not withheld under Exemption 3, so discussion of whether\nanother statute prohibits or requires its disclosure is not relevant. But even if it were, as discussed\nabove, section 1229a(b)(4)(B) requires disclosure of “evidence against” the alien, which means\nthat, as a prerequisite to the invocation of that provision, evidence must have been offered at the\nimmigration proceeding. And second, as this Court found above, there is a privilege against\ndisclosure of the Assessment that justifies the invocation of Exemption 5 in this case. Section\n1229a(b)(4)(B)’s requirement is consistent with that finding because, to the extent that the\nAssessment is introduced into evidence and therefore triggers that section’s disclosure\nrequirement, defendant would have waived the privilege and its ability to invoke Exemption 5.\nPlaintiff’s reliance on Julian is therefore misplaced. Similarly, plaintiff cannot rely on the\ndiscussion in DOJ v. Tax Analysts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112320\"><a href=\"/opinion/112320/department-of-justice-v-tax-analysts/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), where the Supreme Court refused to\nimply a FOIA exemption on the ground that another statute governed the disclosure of the\ndocuments sought. See Pl.’s Reply at 6, quoting Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. at 154; see also Pl.’s\nOpp. at 16. Defendant does not justify its withholding in this case on the ground that section\n1229a(b)(4)(B) trumps FOIA; it argues that the deliberative process privilege protects that\ndocument under Exemption 5 unless and until that privilege is waived..\n                                                  18\n\fwhatever privilege may have attached.” Pl.’s Mot. at 10–16; Pl.’s Reply at 6–7. But it is\n\naxiomatic that a party does not waive a privilege by intending to take an action in the future;\n\nprivilege is waived only when that action is actually taken. As a result, plaintiff cannot rely on\n\nthe principle that voluntary disclosures may waive privileges because defendant has not made\n\nany voluntary disclosure or taken any action that would waive the deliberative process privilege\n\nat this time, and all of plaintiff’s arguments relating to defendant’s alleged waiver of the\n\nprivilege are cast in the future tense.13 See Pl.’s Mot. at 10 (“DHS states if the Assessment is\n\n\n\n\n13       For this reason, plaintiff’s argument that defendant cannot unilaterally use the\nAssessment and then claim the privilege must fail: Defendant has not yet attempted to use the\nAssessment against plaintiff in immigration court, see Pl.’s Mot. at 11 (“Defendant plans to use\nthe Assessment . . . .”), which makes the cases plaintiff relies on inapplicable.

Pl.’s Mot. at 17–18; Pl.’s Reply at 7–9. This\n\nargument fails for the same reason the waiver claims are unavailing.\n\n       Judicial estoppel is an equitable rule that provides that “[w]here a party assumes a certain\n\nposition in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter,\n\nsimply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the\n\nprejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.”                  New\n\nHampshire v.

It is meant “to protect the integrity of the judicial process, by prohibiting parties from\n\ndeliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.” Id. at 749–50\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Those concerns are not present here: the fact\n\nthat DHS may choose to waive a privilege – or even regularly chooses to waive that privilege –\n\nis not inconsistent with maintaining the position that the material is privileged in the first place.\n\nA party should not be estopped from asserting a privilege initially just because it may later waive\n\nthat privilege if it finds it in its interest to do so. Here, defendant has not yet waived the privilege\n\nthat covers the Assessment, and what it may or may not do in the future does not operate as\n\nestoppel.\n\n       Plaintiff’s fifth argument echoes his judicial estoppel points: that an agency which is\n\ninconsistent is not entitled to deference by the courts. Pl.’s Mot. at 21–22; Pl.’s Reply at 10–11.\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fAs examples of defendant’s inconsistent positions, plaintiff states that (1) “DHS frequently\n\nprovided assessments to asylum applicants in the past,” (2) “DHS delivered the notes of the\n\nasylum officer to Mr. Abtew,” changing its position that the notes were exempt, and (3) DHS’s\n\ntraining manuals, that are included on its website, informs AOs that an asylum applicant “may\n\nsubmit a Freedom of Information Act [(FOIA)] request to obtain a copy of an assessment (and\n\nother information in the file).” Pl.’s Mot. at 21–23 (citations omitted); see also Pl.’s Opp. at 13;\n\nPl.’s Reply at 10–11. But plaintiff offers no evidence to support his first contention, and as the\n\nCourt has already noted, the fact that the Assessment may be revealed in litigation later does not\n\nbear upon the validity of the exemption.\n\n        Similarly, the training manuals that plaintiff cites do not support a conclusion that\n\ndefendant is being inconsistent in its position regarding the availability of the Assessment under\n\nFOIA. The training manuals alert AOs to the fact that an asylum applicant “may submit” a FOIA\n\nrequest to obtain the Assessment. They do not indicate that the request will be honored without\n\ncontest. Finally, it is not unusual for a party to modify its position in litigation. And if plaintiff\n\nhas concerns about defendant’s good faith, the Court has conducted its own in camera review of\n\nthe Assessment, and it finds no reason to disturb the agency’s characterization of the document\n\nas deliberative.14\n\n\n\n14      Plaintiff argues that notes of an AO and the Assessment are similar, and therefore if the\nnotes are not exempt, there is no reason to find the Assessment exempt. Pl.’s Opp. at 10–11, 13–\n14. But that logic does not add up. The notes a person takes during an interview do not\nnecessarily include the interviewer’s analysis or subjective opinion about the veracity or\nconsistency of what the interviewee is saying. The Assessment, on the other hand, includes that\ntype of subjective analysis, which is why the Court found it protected by the deliberative process\nprivilege. And to the extent that the Assessment includes facts that are also included in the notes\nthat have been disclosed, the Assessment can still be protected so long as the Court finds that the\nfacts in the Assessment are so interwoven with the subjective analysis of the AO that they are\nnecessarily deliberative in and of themselves. As described more fully below, the Court makes\nthat finding in this case.\n                                                 21\n\f       Plaintiff’s final two arguments are essentially policy arguments as to why the Court\n\nshould not allow defendant to invoke Exemption 5 in this case: that invocation of Exemption 5\n\nthreatens plaintiff’s rights under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b), Pl.’s Mot. at 23–26; Pl.’s Reply at 11, and\n\nthat the “integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full\n\ndisclosure of all the facts.” Pl.’s Mot. at 27–30.\n\n       Once again, any argument that plaintiff’s rights under section 1229a(b) are threatened by\n\nthe invocation of Exemption 5 is premature. Section 1229a(b)(4)(B) provides an alien with\n\n“reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him,” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B); it\n\ndoes not provide him with the right to obtain evidence that might be used against him in\n\nadvance.15   Similarly, plaintiff’s additional section 1229a(b) arguments about fundamental\n\n\n\n\n15      Singh v.

See Pl.’s Mot. at 24,\n26. Moreover, plaintiff’s consistent characterization of defendant’s statements to mean that\ndefendant will give the Assessment to plaintiff in the future misconstrues defendant’s pleadings.\nSee, e.g., Pl.’s Reply at 11 (“DHS agrees that 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b) gives rights to Abtew, and that\neventually, DHS shall give [the Assessment] to him. Why not give it to him now?”). Although\ndefendant acknowledges that section 1229a(b) gives plaintiff rights in his immigration\nproceeding that it must honor if it decides to use the Assessment, its acknowledgement that the\nAssessment will be provided is explicitly conditioned on a decision to actually use that\nAssessment in the proceeding. See Def.’s Mot. at 8; Def.’s SOF ¶ 14; Pl.’s SOF ¶ 11. That\ndecision has not yet been made. Def.’s Mot. at 7.\n\n\n                                                 22\n\ffairness do not negate the applicability of the FOIA exemption to a document that may not ever\n\nbe introduced at the immigration proceeding.16\n\n       The Court recognizes the importance of the civil and criminal discovery mechanisms that\n\nplaintiff itemizes in his pleadings, see Pl.’s Mot. at 27–30; Pl.’s Reply at 12, but he will be\n\nafforded due process and discovery rights at the immigration hearing, including, if appropriate, a\n\nright to the Assessment under section 1229a(b)(4)(B). The analogy to civil discovery rules is\n\ninapposite since a work product privilege is recognized in that context as well, and the\n\nprotections plaintiff lists that are offered to a criminal defendant arise in the context of an\n\nindictment and subsequent trial – not in advance of the initiation of court proceedings.17\n\n\n\n\n16      Plaintiff cites Dent v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179022\"><a href=\"/opinion/179022/dent-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2010) in support of his contention\nthat fundamental fairness requires defendant to release the Assessment now. Pl.’s Mot. at 25.\nBut Dent is distinguishable from this case because it involved a different provision of Title 8,\nwhich provides an alien with the right to “access . . . the alien’s visa or other entry document, if\nany, and any other records and documents not considered by the Attorney General to be\nconfidential, pertaining to the alien’s admission or presence in the United States.” 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229a(c)(2)(B). Moreover, the fundamental fairness discussions in Al Khouri, 362 F.3d at 464,\nand Hernandez-Guadarrama, 394 F.3d at 682, have no relevance in this case because any injury\nresulting to plaintiff from not permitting him enough time to review evidence or cross-examine\nwitnesses against him to ensure fairness at his immigration proceeding is speculative at this time.\nSee Singh, 405 F. App’x at 193 (noting that an alien may obtain a continuance, if needed, to\nreview evidence presented against him at an immigration proceeding).\n\n17    Moreover, plaintiff is incorrect about the scope of discovery in the criminal context: for\nexample, grand jury witnesses do not automatically get transcripts of their testimony.\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f         As a result, the Court is unpersuaded by plaintiff’s arguments that defendant cannot\n\ninvoke Exemption 5 as a justification for withholding the deliberative portions of the\n\nAssessment.18\n\n   II.      There are reasonably segregable portions of the Assessment that defendant must\n            disclose.\n\n         Plaintiff argues in the alternative that, even if the document is properly withheld, the\n\nsegregable facts contained in it are not deliberative and must be disclosed to him. Pl.’s Reply at\n\n12–14. Defendant states that the facts included in the Assessment are so interwoven with the\n\ndeliberative portions of that document that they cannot be reasonably segregated and are\n\ntherefore properly withheld. Def.’s Mot. at 4–5; Eggleston Decl. ¶ 17. The Court ordered\n\nproduction of the Assessment for in camera review in order to resolve this dispute. Apr. 29,\n\n2014 Minute Entry.\n\n         Under FOIA, “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any\n\nperson requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.” 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(b). This Circuit has held that any “non-exempt portions of a document must be disclosed\n\nunless they are inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.” Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Air Force, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350872\"><a href=\"/opinion/350872/mead-data-central-inc-v-united-states-department-of-the-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\n\n         After reviewing the Assessment in camera, the Court concludes that the first six\n\nparagraphs simply recite and summarize the facts that plaintiff presented to the AO during his\n\n\n18      The Court notes, though, that this case presents a unique situation where the document at\nissue may have significant repercussions for plaintiff if it is used at his immigration proceeding.\nBased on the potential significant impact that the document may have on plaintiff’s immigration\nstatus, as well as the strong likelihood that the Assessment will be introduced at plaintiff’s\nimmigration proceeding and that such use would in fact waive the deliberative process privilege\nwhile simultaneously triggering the protection afforded to plaintiff by section 1229a(b)(4)(B),\nthe Court encourages defendant to not delay in providing the Assessment to plaintiff if it\nultimately decides it will be used in the immigration proceeding.\n\n                                                24\n\fasylum application interview. Those paragraphs do not include any analysis or impressions, and\n\nthey do not reflect the AO’s deliberative process: although the document does not purport to be\n\na verbatim rendition of the interview, and there may have been some streamlining involved, the\n\nsummary does not involve the sort of culling of facts from a large universe that could be\n\ncharacterized as deliberative. See Ancient Coin Collection Guild v. U.S. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"214764\"><a href=\"/opinion/214764/ancient-coin-collectors-v-us-dept-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (noting that factual summaries may reflect the predecisional,\n\ndeliberative process where they indicate “an exercise of judgment as to what issues are most\n\nrelevant to the pre-decisional findings and recommendations”). The paragraphs are therefore not\n\nprotected by Exemption 5, and they are easily segregated from the privileged portions of the\n\nAssessment that follow. So, the first six paragraphs of the document must be disclosed to\n\nplaintiff.\n\n           The remaining portions of the Assessment, however, are properly withheld under\n\nExemption 5. Any facts contained in those paragraphs are interwoven with the AO’s reasoning\n\nand recommended disposition, and they cannot be reasonably segregated from the privileged\n\nmaterial. Thus, defendant may continue to withhold the remaining portions of the Assessment\n\nunder Exemption 5.\n\n    III.      Plaintiff’s claim that defendant’s failure to disclose the Assessment violates 8\n              U.S.C. § 1229a(b) is not ripe.\n           Count III of the complaint requests that this Court find that defendant violated plaintiff’s\n\nrights under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B) by failing to provide him with a copy of the Assessment.\n\nThe parties disagree as to whether that section creates a private cause of action, Def.’s Mot. at 7;\n\nPl.’s Opp. at 16, and defendant also asserts that this count should be dismissed as premature.\n\nDef.’s Mot. at 1. Because this claim is not ripe, it will be dismissed, and the Court need not\n\nreach the issue of whether plaintiff has a private cause of action under section 1229a.\n\n\n                                                   25\n\f       Ripeness is a two-pronged inquiry: first, courts consider “the ‘fitness of the issues for\n\njudicial decision,’” and second, they consider “the extent to which withholding a decision will\n\ncause ‘hardship to the parties.’” Am. Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2012), quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149 (1967). Here, plaintiff’s rights under\n\nsection 1229a(b)(4)(B) are not “fit for judicial decision” because, as indicated above, they have\n\nnot yet been triggered. Defendant has not yet sought to introduce the Assessment as evidence\n\nagainst plaintiff at the immigration proceeding or even indicated that it will do so. And it is\n\nentirely speculative that plaintiff will suffer any harm because he has to wait; at this point, we do\n\nnot know whether plaintiff will be entitled to review the document, and how much time he will\n\nbe given if he is. As a result, the Court finds that Count III of the complaint is not ripe and\n\nshould be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the Assessment is covered by the deliberative process privilege and because that\n\nprivilege has not been waived as of the date of this opinion, the Court finds that defendant\n\nproperly withheld the document under FOIA Exemption 5. But it also finds that the first six\n\nparagraphs of the document are not deliberative and that they are reasonably segregable from any\n\nprotected information, so defendant must therefore release those paragraphs to plaintiff. The\n\nCourt will therefore grant defendant’s motion for summary judgment in part and deny it in part,\n\nwhile also granting plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in part and denying it in part with\n\nrespect to Count II.\n\n       Additionally, the Court finds that Count III of the complaint is premature because the\n\nrights plaintiff seeks to protect have not yet been triggered. As a result, the Court will dismiss\n\nCount III on ripeness grounds. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                             AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                             United States District Judge\n\nDATE: June 13, 2014\n\n\n\n\n                                               27\n\f</pre>",
