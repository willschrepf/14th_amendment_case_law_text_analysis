Franklin Waters, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Arkansas, sitting by designation.\n\fHEANEY, Circuit Judge.\n\n    The State of Minnesota appeals the district court’s\ndenial of its motion to dismiss Jock Orville Autio’s\nclaims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\nand other supplemental state law claims.       Minnesota\ncontends that Autio’s claims should have been dismissed\nbecause   the  district   court   lacked   jurisdiction.\nSpecifically,  Minnesota   argues   that  the   Eleventh\nAmendment acts as a bar to an ADA claim against a state\nin federal court.     We conclude that the state was\nproperly sued in federal court and affirm the district\ncourt.\n\n                           I.\n\n    Plaintiff/appellee, Autio, worked as a store clerk in\nthe Minnesota State Department of Administration’s\nCentral Store for Materials Management.        On several\noccasions, Autio requested accommodations for various\nphysical disabilities.    According to Autio, Minnesota\ndenied his requests. Autio also claims that his union,\nAFSCME, Local 3139, did not provide him any assistance in\npursuing his claim.        Autio argues that without\naccommodations his employment responsibilities aggravated\nhis physical condition and caused him injury.       Autio\nfiled a claim alleging unlawful employment practices in\nviolation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213; the\nMinnesota Human Rights Act, Minn. Stat. §§ 363.01-363.20;\nand the Minnesota Workers’ Compensation Act, Minn. Stat.\n§§ 176.001-176.861.\n\n\n\n\n                            2\n\f    Minnesota moved to dismiss on the grounds that the\nEleventh Amendment barred Autio’s ADA claims from being\nheard in federal court. Minnesota argued that once the\nADA claims were dismissed, the court lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction to hear the remaining state law\nclaims.    The district court held that Minnesota’s\nEleventh Amendment immunity was lawfully abrogated by\nCongress and it could properly be sued in federal court.\nMinnesota appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                           3\n\f                                         II.\n\n    Whether a complaint sufficiently states a cause of\naction is a legal question subject to de novo review.\nWestcott v. Omaha, 901 F.2d 1486, 1488 (8th Cir. 1990)\n(citing Morton v. Becker, 793 F.2d 185, 187 (8th Cir.\n1986)). In reviewing a motion to dismiss, we assume all\nfacts alleged by a plaintiff are true. Id. Dismissal is\nonly proper if it appears that a plaintiff is unable to\nprove any set of facts entitling the plaintiff to relief.\nId. (citing Morton, 793 F.2d at 187).\n\n     Minnesota argues that the Eleventh Amendment to the\nUnited   States  Constitution   bars   Autio’s  claims.2\nSpecifically, Minnesota contends that the ADA does not\nrepresent an appropriate congressional exercise of its\nenforcement power so as to override its Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.\n\n    Under the Eleventh Amendment, a state is not subject\nto suit in federal court by its own citizens. Edelman v.\nJordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1974).        A state can,\nhowever, expressly waive its immunity to suit or Congress\ncan abrogate a state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 239-41\n(1985) (citations omitted). In this case, both parties\nagree that Minnesota has not waived its immunity to suit.\n\n\n\n      2\n       The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial Power of the United\nStates shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or\nprosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens\nor Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S. Const. amend. XI.\n                                           4\n\fTherefore, we must determine whether Congress properly\nabrogated Minnesota’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.3\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        Although Minnesota did not specifically raise Eleventh Amendment immunity\nas a defense to Autio’s state law claims in the district court, it has properly raised this\ndefense on appeal. See Bueford v. Resolution Trust Corp., 991 F.2d 481, 485 (8th Cir.\n1993) (subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time by a party to an action).\nBecause Minnesota has not consented to suit in federal court based on Autio’s state\nlaw claims, we lack jurisdiction to decide the supplemental state claims. See Pennhurst\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 121 (1984) (under the Eleventh\nAmendment, a federal court lacks jurisdiction to hear supplemental state law claims\nagainst a state even if the court has jurisidction to hear the federal claims). Therefore,\nwe only determine whether Congress properly abrogated Minnesota’s Eleventh\nAmendment immunity under the ADA.\n                                            5\n\f    In Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 116 S. Ct.\n1114, 1123 (1996), the Supreme Court set forth a two-part\ntest to determine whether Congress has properly abrogated\na state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.         The first\nquestion is whether Congress unequivocally expressed an\nintent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity.       Id.\n(citing Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985)). The\nsecond question is whether Congress acted pursuant to a\nvalid exercise of power. Id.\n\n    With regard to the first question, it is clear that\nin enacting the ADA, Congress unequivocally abrogated a\nstate’s Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal\ncourt. See 42 U.S.C. § 12202 (under the ADA, “[a] State\nshall not be immune under the eleventh amendment”).\nSecond, in determining whether Congress acted pursuant to\na valid grant of power, we look to the Fourteenth\nAmendment because the ADA was explicitly enacted to\nprovide equal protection to those with disabilities. 42\nU.S.C. 12101(b)(4).       Section 1 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment provides that a state may not “deny . . . any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of\nthe laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Section 5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides that “Congress shall\nhave power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the\nprovisions of this article.” Id. § 5.\n\n    We now turn to whether Congress properly enacted the\nADA under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.      In\nKatzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 651 (1966), the\nSupreme Court set forth a three-part test to determine\nwhether Congress properly enacted legislation under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment: (1) whether the\n\n                            6\n\fstatute may be regarded as an enactment to enforce the\nEqual Protection Clause; (2)\n\n\n\n\n                          7\n\fwhether it is plainly adapted in furthering that end; and\n(3) whether it is consistent, and not prohibited by, the\nletter and the spirit of the Constitution.\n\n    First, the ADA was clearly enacted to enforce the\nEqual Protection Clause. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4) (one\npurpose of the ADA was “to invoke the sweep of\ncongressional authority, including the power to enforce\nthe fourteenth amendment . . . in order to address the\nmajor areas of discrimination faced day to day by people\nwith disabilities”). Second, we believe that the ADA was\nplainly adapted to enforcing the Equal Protection Clause.\n Relying heavily on City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct.\n2157 (1997), Minnesota contends that the ADA is not\n“plainly adapted” to enforcing the Equal Protection\nClause because it prohibits more than what a court might\nfind unconstitutional. In Flores, the Court struck down\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because, in part,\nthe “legislative record lack[ed] examples of modern\ninstances of generally applicable laws passed because of\nreligious bigotry. The history of persecution in this\ncountry detailed in the hearings mentions no episodes\noccurring in the past 40 years.” Id. at 2169 (citations\nomitted).   In this respect, the Court found that, in\npassing the RFRA, Congress was attempting to a make a\nsubstantive constitutional change, rather than enforcing\na recognized Fourteenth Amendment right. Id. at 2170.\n\n    “While preventative rules are sometimes appropriate\nremedial measures, there must be a congruence between the\nmeans used and the ends to be achieved.               The\nappropriateness of remedial measures must be considered\n\n                            8\n\fin light of the evil presented.” Id. (citation omitted).\nUnlike the RFRA, the ADA clearly chronicles and directly\naddresses the discrimination people with disabilities\nhave experienced and the “evils” those with disabilities\ncontinue to experience in modern day America.        For\nexample, the ADA and its legislative record illuminate\nthe fact that approximately 43 million Americans have\ndisabilities, that disability discrimination is still a\npervasive problem in our society, that people with\ndisabilities face isolation and segregation in all\naspects of life, including employment, and that such\ndiscrimination costs the United\n\n\n\n\n                           9\n\fStates billions of dollars in lost productivity and\ndependency each year.     See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §\n                 4\n12101(a)(1)-(9).\n\n    In passing the ADA, Congress was not attempting to a\nmake a substantive constitutional change. Rather, it was\nattempting to enforce a recognized Fourteenth Amendment\nright: equal protection. In Flores, the Court restated\nits long-held view that “[l]egislation which deters or\nremedies constitutional violations can fall within the\nsweep of Congress’ enforcement power even if in the\nprocess it prohibits conduct which is not itself\nunconstitutional and intrudes into ‘legislative spheres\nof autonomy previously reserved to the states.’” Flores,\n117 S. Ct. at 2163 (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427\nU.S. 445, 455 (1976)).      Congress is prohibited from\ndetermining    “what    constitutes   a    constitutional\nviolation,” id. at 2164, but it may enact legislation\nprohibiting conduct which a court itself may not deem\n\n\n       4\n        Before enacting the ADA, Congress conducted exhaustive fact finding as to the\nlevel of disability discrimination in the United States. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 101-116,\nat 6 (1989) (quoting testimony of Timothy Cook of the National Disability Action\nCenter, concerning the adverse and pervasive effects of disability discrimination); id.\nat 7 (quoting the testimony of Judith Heumann (currently the head of the Office of\nSpecial Education and Rehabilitative Services for the United States Department of\nEducation), detailing the significant discrimination she faced because of her\ndisabilities); id. at 8 (citing the testimony of a Kentucky parent who was fired from her\njob because the son with whom she lived had AIDS); id. at 12 (citing testimony\nregarding inaccessibility issues faced by those with disabilities). In total, in addition\nto conducting numerous hearings, both the House and Senate cited seven reports or\nstudies that clearly detailed the pervasive and serious effects of disability discrimination\nin modern day America. See id. at 6; H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 28, U.S. Code\nCong. & Admin. News 1990, 267, 309-10 (1990).\n                                            10\n\funconstitutional. We must afford congressional findings\nsignificant deference. Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC,\n117 S. Ct. 1174, 1189 (1997) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                          11\n\f    Unlike the RFRA struck down in Flores, the ADA is\n“plainly adapted” as a remedial measure even though each\nindividual violation of the ADA may not in and of itself\nbe unconstitutional. The remedies provided in the ADA\nare not so sweeping that they exceed the harms they are\nsought to redress. Because of the clear “evil” present\nin disability discrimination and the well-documented need\nfor equal protection in this respect, the ADA is plainly\nadapted to the end of providing those with disabilities\nequal protection under the law.\n\n    Third, the ADA is consistent with the letter and\nspirit of the Constitution. In Seminole Tribe, although\nstriking down a statute abrogating sovereign immunity\nunder the Indian Commerce Clause, the Court recognized\nthat Section “5 of the Fourteenth Amendment [has] allowed\nCongress to abrogate . . . immunity from suit guaranteed\nby that Amendment.” Seminole Tribe, 116 S. Ct. at 1125.\n\n\n    Minnesota argues that Congress has exceeded its power\nin passing legislation that protects rights under Section\n5 but is not related to a quasi-suspect or suspect\nclassification.    Nevertheless, other laws passed by\nCongress have been upheld as constitutionally abrogating\nEleventh Amendment immunity even though the rights\n\n\n\n\n                           12\n\fprotected are not grounded in a quasi-suspect or suspect\nclassification.5   In this respect, the Seventh Circuit\nstated:\n\n      The Eleventh Amendment does not insulate the\n      states from suits in federal courts to enforce\n      federal statutes enacted under the authority of\n      the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .     Although the\n      state argues that the ADA is outside the scope\n      of the section 5, that     argument is refuted by\n      . . . Congress’s concern that disabled persons\n      are victims of discrimination.          Invidious\n      discrimination by governmental agencies . . .\n      violates the      equal protection clause even if\n      the discrimination is not racial, though racial\n          discrimination was the original focus of the\n      clause.    In creating a remedy against such\n      discrimination, Congress was acting well within\n      its powers under section 5, as the courts have\n      concluded with respect to the Age Discrimination\n      in Employment Act, which is similar to the ADA\n      in forbidding a form of discrimination remote\n      from the contemplation of the framers of the\n      Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n\n      5\n        For example, four other circuits have addressed the validity of the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621, and upheld it as a valid exercise\nof Congress’s Section 5 power. See Hurd v. Pittsburgh State Univ., 109 F.3d 1540,\n1546 (10th Cir. 1997); Ramirez v. Puerto Rico Fire Serv., 715 F.2d 694, 698-700 (1st\nCir. 1983); EEOC v. County of Calumet, 686 F.2d 1249, 1251-52 (7th Cir. 1982);\nArritt v. Grisell, 567 F.2d 1267, 1271 (4th Cir. 1977). This issue is currently before\nour court in Humenansky v. Regents of the University of Minnesota, No. 97-2302.\nSimilarly, the four circuits that have addressed the issue have upheld the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400, on the same grounds. See Mitten\nv. Muscogee County Sch. Dist., 877 F.2d 932, 937 (11th Cir. 1989); Counsel v. Dow,\n849 F.2d 731, 737 (2d Cir. 1988); David D. v. Dartmouth Sch. Comm., 775 F.2d 411,\n421 n.7 (1st Cir. 1985); Crawford v. Pittman, 708 F.2d 1028, 1036-38 (5th Cir. 1983).\n                                         13\n\fCrawford v. Indiana Dep’t of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481,\n487 (7th Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted)\n(citations omitted).6\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        In addition to the Seventh Circuit, Crawford, 115 F.3d at 487, two of our other\nsister circuits that have addressed the issue before us have also held that a state may\nbe properly sued in federal court under the Americans with Disabilities Act. See\nCoolbaugh v. Louisiana, 1998 WL 84123, at *6-*7 (5th Cir. Feb. 27, 1998); Clark v.\nCalifornia, 123 F.3d 1267, 1270-71 (9th Cir. 1997), petition for cert. filed, 66 U.S.L.W.\n3308 (Oct. 20, 1997) (No. 97-686).\n                                           14\n\f    Additionally, in enforcing a disabled person’s\nrights, we believe that the ADA is consistent with the\nspirit and letter of the Constitution as evidenced by\nSupreme Court precedent.      For example, in City of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 444\n(1985) (plurality opinion), the Court reasoned that\nalthough the disabled are not entitled to heightened\nscrutiny, “legislation . . . singling out the [disabled]\nfor special treatment reflects the real and undeniable\ndifferences between the [disabled] and others,” thereby\nallowing the disabled equal protection from “invidious\ndiscrimination.” Id. at 442-47. Moreover, in Cleburne\nthe Court underscored Congress’s principal institutional\ncompetence in making decisions concerning the disabled’s\nlegal treatment: “How this large and diversified group\nis to be treated under the law is a difficult and often\na technical matter, very much a task for legislators\nguided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps\nill-informed opinions of the judiciary.” Cleburne, 473\nU.S. at 442-43.\n\n    Therefore, we hold that the ADA represents a proper\nexercise of Congress’s Section 5 enforcement power under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. As a result, Minnesota is not\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from actions\nbrought pursuant to the ADA.\n\n                         III.\n\n    For the reasons discussed    above,   we   affirm   the\ndistrict court’s decision.\n\n\n\n\n                           15\n\fA true copy.\n\n    Attest.\n\n        CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                       16\n\f",

We conclude that the state was\nproperly sued in federal court and affirm the district\ncourt.\n\n                           I.\n\n    Plaintiff/appellee, Autio, worked as a store clerk in\nthe Minnesota State Department of Administration’s\nCentral Store for Materials Management.        On several\noccasions, Autio requested accommodations for various\nphysical disabilities.    According to Autio, Minnesota\ndenied his requests. Autio also claims that his union,\nAFSCME, Local 3139, did not provide him any assistance in\npursuing his claim.        Autio argues that without\naccommodations his employment responsibilities aggravated\nhis physical condition and caused him injury.       Autio\nfiled a claim alleging unlawful employment practices in\nviolation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213; the\nMinnesota Human Rights Act, Minn. Stat. §§ 363.01-363.20;\nand the Minnesota Workers’ Compensation Act, Minn. Stat.\n§§ 176.001-176.861.\n\n\n\n\n                            2\n\f    Minnesota moved to dismiss on the grounds that the\nEleventh Amendment barred Autio’s ADA claims from being\nheard in federal court. Minnesota argued that once the\nADA claims were dismissed, the court lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction to hear the remaining state law\nclaims.    The district court held that Minnesota’s\nEleventh Amendment immunity was lawfully abrogated by\nCongress and it could properly be sued in federal court.\nMinnesota appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                           3\n\f                                         II.\n\n    Whether a complaint sufficiently states a cause of\naction is a legal question subject to de novo review.\nWestcott v.

(citing Morton, 793 F.2d at 187).\n\n     Minnesota argues that the Eleventh Amendment to the\nUnited   States  Constitution   bars   Autio’s  claims.2\nSpecifically, Minnesota contends that the ADA does not\nrepresent an appropriate congressional exercise of its\nenforcement power so as to override its Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.\n\n    Under the Eleventh Amendment, a state is not subject\nto suit in federal court by its own citizens.

In this case, both parties\nagree that Minnesota has not waived its immunity to suit.\n\n\n\n      2\n       The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial Power of the United\nStates shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or\nprosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens\nor Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S. Const. amend.

Ct.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1123 (1996), the Supreme Court set forth a two-part\ntest to determine whether Congress has properly abrogated\na state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.         The first\nquestion is whether Congress unequivocally expressed an\nintent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity.       Id.\n(citing Green v. Mansour, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (1985)). The\nsecond question is whether Congress acted pursuant to a\nvalid exercise of power. Id.\n\n    With regard to the first question, it is clear that\nin enacting the ADA, Congress unequivocally abrogated a\nstate’s Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal\ncourt. See 42 U.S.C. § 12202 (under the ADA, “[a] State\nshall not be immune under the eleventh amendment”).\nSecond, in determining whether Congress acted pursuant to\na valid grant of power, we look to the Fourteenth\nAmendment because the ADA was explicitly enacted to\nprovide equal protection to those with disabilities. 42\nU.S.C. 12101(b)(4).       Section 1 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment provides that a state may not “deny . . . any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of\nthe laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Section 5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides that “Congress shall\nhave power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the\nprovisions of this article.” Id. § 5.\n\n    We now turn to whether Congress properly enacted the\nADA under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.      In\nKatzenbach v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107256\"><a href=\"/opinion/107256/katzenbach-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651 (1966), the\nSupreme Court set forth a three-part test to determine\nwhether Congress properly enacted legislation under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment: (1) whether the\n\n                            6\n\fstatute may be regarded as an enactment to enforce the\nEqual Protection Clause; (2)\n\n\n\n\n                          7\n\fwhether it is plainly adapted in furthering that end; and\n(3) whether it is consistent, and not prohibited by, the\nletter and the spirit of the Constitution.\n\n    First, the ADA was clearly enacted to enforce the\nEqual Protection Clause. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4) (one\npurpose of the ADA was “to invoke the sweep of\ncongressional authority, including the power to enforce\nthe fourteenth amendment . . . in order to address the\nmajor areas of discrimination faced day to day by people\nwith disabilities”). Second, we believe that the ADA was\nplainly adapted to enforcing the Equal Protection Clause.\n Relying heavily on City of Boerne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), Minnesota contends that the ADA is not\n“plainly adapted” to enforcing the Equal Protection\nClause because it prohibits more than what a court might\nfind unconstitutional. In Flores, the Court struck down\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because, in part,\nthe “legislative record lack[ed] examples of modern\ninstances of generally applicable laws passed because of\nreligious bigotry. The history of persecution in this\ncountry detailed in the hearings mentions no episodes\noccurring in the past 40 years.” Id. at 2169 (citations\nomitted).   In this respect, the Court found that, in\npassing the RFRA, Congress was attempting to a make a\nsubstantive constitutional change, rather than enforcing\na recognized Fourteenth Amendment right. Id. at 2170.\n\n    “While preventative rules are sometimes appropriate\nremedial measures, there must be a congruence between the\nmeans used and the ends to be achieved.               The\nappropriateness of remedial measures must be considered\n\n                            8\n\fin light of the evil presented.” Id. (citation omitted).\nUnlike the RFRA, the ADA clearly chronicles and directly\naddresses the discrimination people with disabilities\nhave experienced and the “evils” those with disabilities\ncontinue to experience in modern day America.        For\nexample, the ADA and its legislative record illuminate\nthe fact that approximately 43 million Americans have\ndisabilities, that disability discrimination is still a\npervasive problem in our society, that people with\ndisabilities face isolation and segregation in all\naspects of life, including employment, and that such\ndiscrimination costs the United\n\n\n\n\n                           9\n\fStates billions of dollars in lost productivity and\ndependency each year.     See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §\n                 4\n12101(a)(1)-(9).\n\n    In passing the ADA, Congress was not attempting to a\nmake a substantive constitutional change. Rather, it was\nattempting to enforce a recognized Fourteenth Amendment\nright: equal protection. In Flores, the Court restated\nits long-held view that “[l]egislation which deters or\nremedies constitutional violations can fall within the\nsweep of Congress’ enforcement power even if in the\nprocess it prohibits conduct which is not itself\nunconstitutional and intrudes into ‘legislative spheres\nof autonomy previously reserved to the states.’” Flores,\n117 S. Ct. at 2163 (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109520\"><a href=\"/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455 (1976)).      Congress is prohibited from\ndetermining    “what    constitutes   a    constitutional\nviolation,” id. at 2164, but it may enact legislation\nprohibiting conduct which a court itself may not deem\n\n\n       4\n        Before enacting the ADA, Congress conducted exhaustive fact finding as to the\nlevel of disability discrimination in the United States. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 101-116,\nat 6 (1989) (quoting testimony of Timothy Cook of the National Disability Action\nCenter, concerning the adverse and pervasive effects of disability discrimination); id.\nat 7 (quoting the testimony of Judith Heumann (currently the head of the Office of\nSpecial Education and Rehabilitative Services for the United States Department of\nEducation), detailing the significant discrimination she faced because of her\ndisabilities); id. at 8 (citing the testimony of a Kentucky parent who was fired from her\njob because the son with whom she lived had AIDS); id. at 12 (citing testimony\nregarding inaccessibility issues faced by those with disabilities). In total, in addition\nto conducting numerous hearings, both the House and Senate cited seven reports or\nstudies that clearly detailed the pervasive and serious effects of disability discrimination\nin modern day America. See id. at 6; H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 28, U.S. Code\nCong. & Admin. News 1990, 267, 309-10 (1990).\n                                            10\n\funconstitutional. We must afford congressional findings\nsignificant deference. Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118097\"><a href=\"/opinion/118097/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The remedies provided in the ADA\nare not so sweeping that they exceed the harms they are\nsought to redress. Because of the clear “evil” present\nin disability discrimination and the well-documented need\nfor equal protection in this respect, the ADA is plainly\nadapted to the end of providing those with disabilities\nequal protection under the law.\n\n    Third, the ADA is consistent with the letter and\nspirit of the Constitution. In Seminole Tribe, although\nstriking down a statute abrogating sovereign immunity\nunder the Indian Commerce Clause, the Court recognized\nthat Section “5 of the Fourteenth Amendment [has] allowed\nCongress to abrogate . . . immunity from suit guaranteed\nby that Amendment.” Seminole Tribe, 116 S. Ct. at 1125.\n\n\n    Minnesota argues that Congress has exceeded its power\nin passing legislation that protects rights under Section\n5 but is not related to a quasi-suspect or suspect\nclassification.    Nevertheless, other laws passed by\nCongress have been upheld as constitutionally abrogating\nEleventh Amendment immunity even though the rights\n\n\n\n\n                           12\n\fprotected are not grounded in a quasi-suspect or suspect\nclassification.5   In this respect, the Seventh Circuit\nstated:\n\n      The Eleventh Amendment does not insulate the\n      states from suits in federal courts to enforce\n      federal statutes enacted under the authority of\n      the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .     Although the\n      state argues that the ADA is outside the scope\n      of the section 5, that     argument is refuted by\n      . . . Congress’s concern that disabled persons\n      are victims of discrimination.          Invidious\n      discrimination by governmental agencies . . .\n      violates the      equal protection clause even if\n      the discrimination is not racial, though racial\n          discrimination was the original focus of the\n      clause.    In creating a remedy against such\n      discrimination, Congress was acting well within\n      its powers under section 5, as the courts have\n      concluded with respect to the Age Discrimination\n      in Employment Act, which is similar to the ADA\n      in forbidding a form of discrimination remote\n      from the contemplation of the framers of the\n      Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n\n      5\n        For example, four other circuits have addressed the validity of the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621, and upheld it as a valid exercise\nof Congress’s Section 5 power.

Moreover, in Cleburne\nthe Court underscored Congress’s principal institutional\ncompetence in making decisions concerning the disabled’s\nlegal treatment: “How this large and diversified group\nis to be treated under the law is a difficult and often\na technical matter, very much a task for legislators\nguided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps\nill-informed opinions of the judiciary.” Cleburne, 473\nU.S. at 442-43.\n\n    Therefore, we hold that the ADA represents a proper\nexercise of Congress’s Section 5 enforcement power under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.
