We once again confront the tragic legacy of\n\nthe misconduct of Annie Dookhan when she was employed as a\n\nchemist at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory Institute\n\n(Hinton lab).   In Bridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk\n\nDist., 471 Mass. 465, 487 (2015) (Bridgeman I), the petitioners\n\nand the intervener, the Committee for Public Counsel Services\n\n(CPCS), asked that we exercise our broad powers of\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nsuperintendence to vacate the thousands of drug convictions\n\naffected by Dookhan's misconduct because the time and expense of\n\ncase-by-case adjudication had become \"untenable.\"    We declined\n\nat that time to adopt their proposed \"global remedy.\"     However,\n\nthe district attorneys have now provided the single justice with\n\nlists identifying more than 20,000 defendants who could be\n\neligible for relief based on Dookhan's misconduct but who have\n\nnot yet sought relief from their drug convictions.     As a result\n\nof the number of potentially aggrieved defendants, the single\n\njustice issued a reservation and report to the full court that\n\nessentially invites us to reconsider whether the time has come\n\nfor a global remedy or whether further steps must be taken to\n\nrealistically implement the remedy of case-by-case adjudication\n\nof potentially thousands of motions for a new trial.\n\n     After such reconsideration, we decline to adopt the\n\ndistrict attorneys' argument that we should stay the course we\n\nhad previously set and take no further action to protect the\n\nrights of the \"relevant Dookhan defendants.\"3   We also decline to\n\nadopt the petitioners' request for a global remedy in which we\n\nwould either vacate the convictions of all relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants with prejudice, and thereby bar any reprosecution, or\n\nvacate the convictions without prejudice, and allow the\n\n\n     3\n       See note 8 and accompanying text, infra, for the\ndefinition of the term \"relevant Dookhan defendants.\"\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nCommonwealth one year to reprosecute, dismissing with prejudice\n\nall cases not reprosecuted within that time period.\n\n       We instead adopt a new protocol for case-by-case\n\nadjudication, which will occur in three phases, and order its\n\nimplementation by the single justice in the form of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment.    In the first phase, the district\n\nattorneys shall exercise their prosecutorial discretion and\n\nreduce the number of relevant Dookhan defendants by moving to\n\nvacate and dismiss with prejudice all drug cases the district\n\nattorneys would not or could not reprosecute if a new trial were\n\nordered.    In the second phase, new, adequate notice shall be\n\napproved by the single justice and provided to all relevant\n\nDookhan defendants whose cases have not been dismissed in phase\n\none.    In the third phase, CPCS shall assign counsel to all\n\nindigent relevant Dookhan defendants who wish to explore the\n\npossibility of moving to vacate their plea or for a new trial.\n\nIf the number seeking counsel is so large that counsel cannot be\n\nassigned despite CPCS's best efforts, the single justice will\n\nfashion an appropriate remedy under our general superintendence\n\nauthority for the constitutional violation, which may include\n\ndismissing without prejudice the relevant drug convictions in\n\ncases where an indigent defendant is deprived of the right to\n\ncounsel.\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\n     We recognize that the implementation of this protocol will\n\nsubstantially burden the district attorneys, CPCS, and the\n\ncourts.   But we also recognize that Dookhan's misconduct at the\n\nHinton lab has substantially burdened the due process rights of\n\nmany thousands of defendants whose convictions rested on her\n\ntainted drug analysis and who, even if they have served their\n\nsentences, continue to suffer the collateral consequences\n\narising from those convictions.   And we recognize as well that,\n\nmore than four years after Dookhan's misconduct was revealed,\n\nmore than 20,000 defendants who are entitled to a conclusive\n\npresumption that egregious government misconduct occurred in\n\ntheir case have yet to receive adequate notice that they may\n\nhave been victimized by Dookhan's misconduct, that they may file\n\na motion to vacate their drug conviction, and that they have a\n\nright to counsel to assist them in the preparation of such a\n\nmotion.   The remedy we order, challenging as it is to implement,\n\npreserves the ability of these defendants to vindicate their\n\nrights through case-by-case adjudication, respects the exercise\n\nof prosecutorial discretion, and maintains the fairness and\n\nintegrity of our criminal justice system in the wake of a\n\nlaboratory scandal of unprecedented magnitude.4\n\n\n     4\n       We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the National\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Massachusetts\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers; the Boston Bar\nAssociation; the National Association for Public Defense; and\n\f                                                                         6\n\n\n       Background.     Dookhan began her employment in November,\n\n2003, as a chemist at the Hinton lab, a forensic drug laboratory\n\nthat was overseen by the Department of Public Health\n\n(department).    See Commonwealth v. Scott, 467 Mass. 336, 338\n\n(2014); Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63, 64 (2013).\n\nAllegations of misconduct regarding her work surfaced in June,\n\n2011, which triggered an internal review and then a formal\n\ninternal investigation by the department in December, 2011.\n\nCharles, supra.      The department concluded that \"Dookhan failed\n\nto follow [Hinton lab] protocols for the transfer and\n\ndocumentation of samples for testing, and subsequently created a\n\nfalse record of said transfers.\"       Id.    Dookhan was placed on\n\npaid administrative leave and then resigned from her position,\n\neffective March 9, 2012.       Id.\n\n       In July, 2012, the Legislature transferred oversight of the\n\nHinton lab to the State police.      See St. 2012, c. 139, § 56\n\n(replacing G. L. c. 22C, § 39); St. 2012, c. 139, § 107\n\n(repealing G. L. c. 111, §§ 12-13).          See also Scott, 467 Mass.\n\n338.    In August, 2012, the State police initiated a more\n\nextensive investigation of the Hinton lab, which \"revealed\n\nnumerous improprieties surrounding Dookhan's conduct in the\n\nlab.\"    Id. at 339.    See Charles, 466 Mass. at 64.      Based in part\n\n\n\nthe New England Innocence Project and the North Carolina Center\non Actual Innocence.\n\f                                                                 7\n\n\non Dookhan's confession of misconduct on August 28, 2012, the\n\nState police investigation revealed, among other misconduct, the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     Dookhan \"admitted to 'dry labbing' for two to three years\n      prior to her transfer out of the [Hinton] lab in 2011,\n      meaning that she would group multiple samples together from\n      various cases that looked alike, then test only a few\n      samples, but report the results as if she had tested each\n      sample individually.\" Scott, supra.\n     She admitted to \"contaminating samples intentionally,\n      including turning negative samples into positive samples on\n      at least a few occasions.\" Id.\n     She admitted that she removed samples from the evidence\n      locker in breach of Hinton lab protocols, postdated entries\n      in the evidence log book, and forged an evidence officer's\n      initials. Id.\n     She falsified reports intended to verify that the gas\n      chromatography-mass spectrometer machine used in\n      \"confirmatory\"5 drug testing was functioning properly before\n      she ran samples through the machine. Id. at 339-340.\n     The potential scope of Dookhan's misconduct encompassed\n      testing samples in over 40,000 cases. Id. at 340. This\n      number is so large because Dookhan \"reported test results\n\n\n\n\n      5\n       \"Confirmatory\" testing is often referred to in our\nopinions as \"secondary\" testing. We use the terms\ninterchangeably.\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\n    on samples at rates consistently much higher than any other\n    chemist in the [Hinton] lab.\" Id.6\n\n    A grand jury indicted Dookhan on seventeen counts of\n\ntampering with evidence, eight counts of obstruction of justice,\n\none count of perjury, and one count of falsely claiming to hold\n\na graduate degree.   Dookhan pleaded guilty to all of the\n\nindictments on November 22, 2013, and she was sentenced to from\n\nthree years to five years in State prison, followed by a\n\nprobationary term of two years.   Scott, 467 Mass. at 337 & n.3.\n\nThe revelations regarding Dookhan's misconduct triggered the\n\nfiling of hundreds of motions for a new trial and for a stay of\n\nexecution of sentence in cases where the defendant was convicted\n\n    6\n       In addition to the State police investigation, the\nGovernor requested a top-to-bottom review of the William A.\nHinton State Laboratory Institute (Hinton lab) to determine\nwhether any other employees at the Hinton lab committed\nmalfeasance. The office of the Inspector General (OIG)\nconducted a fifteen-month investigation of the Hinton lab that\nincluded interviews with more than forty individuals and an\nexamination of more than 200,000 documents. The OIG concluded\nthat \"Dookhan was the sole bad actor at the [Hinton lab]\" and\nthat no other chemist at the laboratory knowingly aided her\nmisconduct. But the OIG report described massive deficiencies\nby the Department of Public Health (department) in its oversight\nand management of the Hinton lab. These deficiencies included a\nlack of accreditation and inadequate chemist training; distant\nor uninterested supervisors; inconsistent testing practices;\ndeviation from chain-of-custody guidelines; and faulty security.\nThis environment \"gave Dookhan the freedom to start making and\nfollowing her own rules.\" Even when coworkers began raising red\nflags about Dookhan, directors at the Hinton lab were\n\"habitually unresponsive\" and \"severely downplayed Dookhan's\nmajor breach in chain-of-custody protocol.\" The OIG report\nconcluded that \"all samples in which Dookhan was the primary\nchemist should be treated as suspect and be subject to careful\nreview.\"\n\f                                                                         9\n\n\nof a drug crime based on a drug analysis conducted by the Hinton\n\nlab.       Charles, 466 Mass. at 65-66.7   To address this onslaught of\n\nmotions, the Chief Justice of the Superior Court in October,\n\n2012, assigned specific judges in seven counties to preside over\n\nspecial \"drug lab\" sessions.       Id. at 65.   To assist these judges\n\nin the adjudication of these cases, the Chief Justice of the\n\nSuperior Court in November, 2012, exercised her authority under\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 47, 378 Mass. 923 (1979), to appoint five\n\nretired Superior Court judges as \"Special Judicial Magistrates\n\nof the Superior Court\" to preside over postconviction motions\n\nrelated to the Hinton lab.       Id. at 66.\n\n       In Scott, 467 Mass. at 337-338, we considered the\n\nappropriate legal standard where a defendant, in response to\n\ngovernment misconduct in his or her case, moves to withdraw a\n\n\n       7\n       These motions were facilitated by a special task force\nestablished by the Governor in September, 2012. The task force,\nled by attorney David Meier, used data from the department to\nidentify individuals who could have been affected by Dookhan's\nmisconduct. The task force then shared the lists with\nprosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges, \"so as to enable\neach of the agencies and offices to respond appropriately.\" The\ntask force concentrated on identifying individuals most\nadversely affected, such as those in custody, awaiting trial, or\non probation or parole. By December, 2012, the task force\nidentified approximately 10,000 individuals who fell in these\npriority categories and who had to be notified immediately that\ntheir cases potentially were affected by Dookhan's misconduct.\nThe task force also produced a more comprehensive list of\napproximately 40,000 cases in which Dookhan served as a primary\nor confirmatory chemist. At the time the task force completed\nits final report, the criminal investigation of Dookhan and the\nOIG's review of the Hinton lab were still ongoing.\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nguilty plea or an admission to sufficient facts to warrant a\n\nfinding of guilty.   We adopted the two-pronged test in Ferrara\n\nv. United States, 456 F.3d 278, 290 (1st Cir. 2006), which\n\nrequires a defendant who seeks to vacate a guilty plea because\n\nof government misconduct to show \"both that 'egregiously\n\nimpermissible conduct . . . by government agents . . . antedated\n\nthe entry of his plea' and that 'the misconduct influenced his\n\ndecision to plead guilty or, put another way, that it was\n\nmaterial to that choice.'\"   Scott, supra at 346.\n\n    In considering whether the defendant had satisfied the\n\nfirst prong of this test, we concluded that, because Dookhan\n\n\"made a number of affirmative misrepresentations by signing\n\n[certificates of drug analysis (drug certificates)] and\n\ntestifying to the identity of substances in cases in which she\n\nhad not in fact properly tested the substances in question,\"\n\nDookhan's misconduct was \"egregious.\"   Id. at 348.   We also\n\nconcluded that, even though there was no indication that any\n\nprosecutor knew of her egregious misconduct, id. at 350 n.7, her\n\nmisconduct is \"attributable to the government\" for purposes of a\n\nmotion for a new trial, id. at 350 & n.7, because as a primary\n\nand secondary chemist she \"participated in the investigation or\n\nevaluation of the case\" and \"reported to the prosecutor's office\n\nconcerning the case.\"   Id. at 349, quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nMartin, 427 Mass. 816, 824 (1998).\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\n       We also recognized the dilemma that a defendant would face\n\nin attempting to prove that the laboratory analysis in his or\n\nher case was tainted by Dookhan's misconduct.      See Scott, 467\n\nMass. at 339, 351-352.    We noted that Dookhan acknowledged \"that\n\nshe may not be able to identify those cases in which she tested\n\nthe samples properly and those in which she did not.\"      Id. at\n\n339.    \"Thus, even if Dookhan herself were to testify in each of\n\nthe thousands of cases in which she served as primary or\n\nsecondary chemist, it is unlikely that her testimony, even if\n\ntruthful, could resolve the question whether she engaged in\n\nmisconduct in a particular case.\"    Id. at 352.   Because it was\n\n\"reasonably certain . . . that her misconduct touched a great\n\nnumber of cases,\" id., but \"may be impossible\" for any defendant\n\nto prove that the drug analysis in his or her case was tainted\n\nby her misconduct, id. at 351, we recognized that her\n\n\"particularly insidious form of misconduct, which belies\n\nreconstruction,\" resulted in \"a lapse of systemic magnitude in\n\nthe criminal justice system.\"    Id. at 352.\n\n       To resolve this dilemma, we exercised our power of \"general\n\nsuperintendence of all courts . . . to correct and prevent\n\nerrors and abuses\" under G. L. c. 211, § 3, and held that, where\n\nDookhan signed the drug certificate in a defendant's case as an\n\nassistant analyst, that is, as the primary or confirmatory\n\nchemist, see Scott, 467 Mass. at 353 n.9, a defendant who seeks\n\f                                                                       12\n\n\nto vacate his or her plea after learning of Dookhan's misconduct\n\n\"is entitled to a conclusive presumption that egregious\n\ngovernment misconduct occurred in [his or her] case.\"         Id. at\n\n352.   The consequence of the conclusive presumption of egregious\n\ngovernment misconduct is that a defendant can satisfy the first\n\nprong of the Ferrara test simply by showing that Dookhan signed\n\nthe drug certificate in his or her case as an assistant analyst.\n\nId. at 353.\n\n       We emphasized in Scott that the \"special evidentiary rule\"\n\nof a conclusive presumption is \"sui generis\" -- \"a remedy\n\ndictated by the particular circumstances surrounding Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct\" that was \"intended to apply only to this narrow\n\nclass of cases in which a defendant seeks to withdraw his or her\n\nguilty plea after having learned of Dookhan's misconduct.\"         Id.\n\nat 353-354.   We declared that \"it is most appropriate that the\n\nbenefit of our remedy inure to defendants\" where, as here, there\n\nis \"government misconduct that has cast a shadow over the entire\n\ncriminal justice system.\"    Id. at 352.    The remedy of a\n\nconclusive presumption, we concluded, takes into account \"the\n\ndue process rights of defendants, the integrity of the criminal\n\njustice system, the efficient administration of justice in\n\nresponding to such potentially broad-ranging misconduct, and the\n\nmyriad public interests at stake.\"    Id.\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\n       We did not relieve a defendant of the burden to satisfy the\n\nsecond prong of the Ferrara test by demonstrating that he or she\n\nsuffered prejudice by pleading guilty or admitting to sufficient\n\nfacts without having learned of Dookhan's misconduct, i.e., we\n\ndid not conclusively presume such prejudice.     Id. at 354-355,\n\n356.    The defendant, therefore, bears the burden of proving \"a\n\nreasonable probability that he [or she] would not have pleaded\n\nguilty had he [or she] known of Dookhan's misconduct,\" and\n\ninstead would have chosen to go to trial.    Id. at 355.   We noted\n\nthat, \"[u]nlike evidence of the particular scope of Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct, evidence of the circumstances surrounding the\n\ndefendant's decision to tender a guilty plea should be well\n\nwithin the defendant's reach.\"    Id. at 354 n.11.\n\n       In Commonwealth v. Francis, 474 Mass. 816 (2016), we\n\nreviewed the denial of a defendant's motion for a new trial\n\nwhere the defendant had been convicted at trial of drug charges\n\nafter drug certificates were admitted in evidence that were\n\nsigned by Dookhan as an assistant analyst.     We concluded that\n\nthe conclusive presumption of \"egregious government misconduct\"\n\nis not limited to motions to withdraw guilty pleas, but that,\n\nwhere the defendant has been convicted at trial, \"[t]he\n\nconsequence of the conclusive presumption is that we deem it\n\nerror to have admitted the drug certificates or comparable\n\nevidence regarding Dookhan's drug analysis where the defendant\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\nhad no knowledge of Dookhan's misconduct and therefore no\n\nopportunity to challenge the admissibility or credibility of\n\nthat evidence.\"   Id. at 817.\n\n    In Commonwealth v. Ruffin, 475 Mass. 1003, 1003-1004\n\n(2016), we declined to apply the conclusive presumption of\n\n\"egregious government misconduct\" where the defendant had\n\npleaded guilty before Dookhan had signed the drug certificate as\n\nan assistant analyst, because her misconduct cannot be said to\n\nhave affected the defendant's plea where the plea occurred\n\nbefore the misconduct.\n\n    Consequently, after our opinions in Scott, Francis, and\n\nRuffin, the defendants who are entitled to the conclusive\n\npresumption of \"egregious government misconduct\" are those who\n\npleaded guilty to a drug charge (or admitted to sufficient facts\n\nto warrant a finding of guilty) or who were found guilty of a\n\ndrug charge at trial after Dookhan signed a drug certificate in\n\f                                                                  15\n\n\ntheir case as a primary or confirmatory chemist.   We refer to\n\nthese as the \"relevant Dookhan defendants.\"8\n\n     In Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 473-494, we considered two\n\nsets of issues raised by relevant Dookhan defendants who\n\npotentially were eligible for relief from their convictions\n\nbecause of Dookhan's misconduct, but who had not yet moved for\n\npostconviction relief.   The first set of issues identified\n\nconcerns that were discouraging these defendants from seeking\n\nthat relief.   The most significant was the risk that, if their\n\nmotion for a new trial were granted, the Commonwealth could\n\nreprosecute them not only on the charge to which the defendants\n\nhad pleaded guilty but also on any charge that was dismissed at\n\nthe time of the plea, and seek a more severe sentence,\n\nespecially where the dismissed charge carried a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence upon conviction.   Id. at 472-473.   Drawing\n\n\n     8\n       The term \"Dookhan defendants\" was defined in Bridgeman v.\nDistrict Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 471 Mass. 465, 467 n.4\n(2015) (Bridgeman I), \"to refer generally to those individuals\nwho were convicted of drug offenses and in whose cases Dookhan\nsigned the certificate of drug analysis (drug certificate) on\nthe line labeled 'Assistant Analyst.'\" Because Bridgeman I was\ndecided before Commonwealth v. Ruffin, 475 Mass. 1003 (2016),\nthe term \"Dookhan defendants\" is broader than the term \"relevant\nDookhan defendants,\" because it includes those with cases in\nwhich Dookhan signed the drug certificate after their guilty\nplea or admission to sufficient facts to warrant a guilty\nfinding. In light of our decision in Ruffin, the set of\ndefendants entitled to the conclusive presumption of egregious\ngovernment misconduct is limited to the \"relevant Dookhan\ndefendants,\" and the relief we order infra is limited to this\nset of defendants.\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\nbroadly on the need to \"ameliorate [the] damaging effects\" of\n\nDookhan's misconduct, id. at 474, we held that \"a defendant who\n\nhas been granted a new trial based on Dookhan's misconduct at\n\nthe Hinton . . . lab cannot be charged with a more serious\n\noffense than that of which he or she initially was convicted\n\nunder the terms of a plea agreement and, if convicted again,\n\ncannot be given a more severe sentence than that which\n\noriginally was imposed.\"   Id. at 468.\n\n    The second set of issues in Bridgeman I concerned the\n\nfairness and practicability of attempting individually to\n\nresolve the multitude of motions for a new trial that\n\npotentially could be brought by the Dookhan defendants.    We\n\nallowed the motion to intervene filed by CPCS under Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 24 (a), 365 Mass. 769 (1974), recognizing that \"[i]t has\n\na substantial and immediate interest in these proceedings given\n\nits current and future responsibility for providing\n\nrepresentation to thousands of indigent Dookhan defendants who\n\nwant to pursue postconviction relief from their drug\n\nconvictions.\"   Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 485-486.    We then\n\naddressed CPCS's contention that, because so many cases were\n\naffected by Dookhan's misconduct, the \"time and expense of\n\nproceeding on a case-by-case basis has become untenable,\" and we\n\ntherefore should implement a \"global remedy\" to resolve these\n\ncases pursuant to our broad powers of superintendence under\n\f                                                                      17\n\n\nG. L. c. 211, § 3.      Bridgeman I, supra at 487.     Under the global\n\nremedy that CPCS proposed, we would vacate the convictions of\n\nall Dookhan defendants.      Id.    CPCS offered two alternatives:   we\n\ncould vacate the convictions with prejudice, and thereby bar any\n\nreprosecution; or we could vacate the convictions without\n\nprejudice, and allow the Commonwealth one year to reprosecute,\n\ndismissing with prejudice all cases not reprosecuted within that\n\ntime period.    Id.\n\n    We declined in Bridgeman I to implement a global remedy \"at\n\nthis time.\"    Id.    We noted that \"while '[i]t certainly is true\n\nthat we cannot expect defendants to bear the burden of a\n\nsystemic lapse, . . . we also cannot allow the misconduct of one\n\nperson to dictate an abrupt retreat from the fundamentals of our\n\ncriminal justice system.'\"         Id., quoting Scott, 467 Mass. at 354\n\nn.11.    We also noted that we had already provided \"meaningful\n\nsolutions\" to resolve these cases in Scott and Charles, and\n\nthat, in Bridgeman I, we were removing the barriers that made\n\ndefendants reluctant to file motions to withdraw their guilty\n\npleas.    Id. at 480, 487.   And we noted that some district\n\nattorneys had made progress in providing CPCS with the docket\n\nnumbers of the cases in which Dookhan was the primary or\n\nconfirmatory chemist, and encouraged the remaining district\n\nattorneys with such cases to assist the single justice in\n\f                                                                     18\n\n\nobtaining docket numbers for their districts.9    Id. at 481.   We\n\nrecognized that \"efforts to provide postconviction relief to\n\nDookhan defendants [had] been hampered by the inability of CPCS\n\nto ascertain which cases may have been tainted by Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct,\" and that \"[t]he ability of CPCS to identify clients\n\nand to assign them attorneys who will represent their interests\n\nin postconviction proceedings is crucial to the administration\n\nof justice in the Hinton . . . lab cases.\"   Id. at 480.   We\n\nremanded the case to the single justice for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with the opinion.   Id. at 494.\n\n     The single justice joined as respondents the district\n\nattorneys for the Cape and Islands, Middlesex, Norfolk, and\n\nPlymouth districts, and allowed the motion of the district\n\nattorney for the Bristol district to intervene.    The single\n\njustice ordered the district attorneys to produce lists with the\n\nnames, docket numbers, and personal identifying information for\n\nevery \"adverse disposition concerning every G. L. c. 94C charge\"\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Only the district attorneys for the Suffolk and Essex\ndistricts were parties to Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 481. They\nprovided CPCS with the relevant docket numbers in their\ndistricts in September, 2014. Id. at 478 n.20. The district\nattorneys for the Bristol and Norfolk districts later provided\nCPCS with the relevant docket numbers before the issuance of the\nopinion in Bridgeman I. Id. The district attorneys for the\nCape and Islands, Middlesex, and Plymouth districts had yet to\ndo so at the time that opinion issued. Id.\n\f                                                                 19\n\n\nof the \"Dookhan defendants.\"10   In May, 2016, the district\n\nattorneys produced lists that contained the names of more than\n\n20,000 defendants with more than 24,000 cases where they had\n\npleaded guilty to a drug charge, had admitted to sufficient\n\nfacts to warrant a finding of guilty of a drug charge, or had\n\nbeen found guilty at trial of a drug charge where Dookhan had\n\ntested the alleged drugs as the primary or confirmatory\n\nchemist.11\n\n\n     10\n       Because the list encompasses the \"Dookhan defendants,\" it\nincludes some defendants who are not \"relevant Dookhan\ndefendants.\" See note 8 and accompanying text, supra.\n     11\n       The lists were the product of the commendable and\nlaborious efforts of the Trial Court's information technology\ndepartment, which identified the set of all cases with a G. L.\nc. 94C charge from 2003 to June, 2011, and of the district\nattorneys' offices, which then identified the subset of these\ncases where Dookhan was the primary or confirmatory chemist.\nThe district attorneys state that they have identified\napproximately 20,544 defendants in 24,577 cases that featured at\nleast some evidence tested by Dookhan and that resulted in an\nadverse consequence. The CPCS data analyst identified 24,391\ncases in which defendants still face adverse dispositions on\ndrug charges where Dookhan was the primary or confirmatory\nchemist. Both parties contend that the respective tallies are\nnot a perfect measure of the remaining pool of cases tainted by\nDookhan's misconduct. As earlier stated, these lists include\ndefendants who are not relevant Dookhan defendants because they\npleaded guilty or admitted to sufficient facts before Dookhan\nsigned the drug certificate as an assistant analyst. The\ndistrict attorneys claim that, apart from including the so-\ncalled Ruffin defendants, the lists overcount the number of\nrelevant Dookhan defendants because they include some defendants\nwho already moved to vacate their pleas, and because they\ninclude defendants who were codefendants in a case where Dookhan\nwas an assistant analyst. The Bridgeman petitioners and CPCS\nclaim that the lists actually undercount the number of remaining\ndefendants because of errors in the district attorneys' data.\n\f                                                                   20\n\n\n     The single justice also asked the parties to attempt to\n\nagree on the content of a letter of notice to the Dookhan\n\ndefendants informing them that their drug cases had been\n\npotentially tainted by Dookhan's misconduct.   After the\n\nsubmission of the lists, however, the Bridgeman petitioners and\n\nCPCS12 would not agree to any notice that presumed case-by-case\n\nlitigation, because they contended that, given the large number\n\nof Dookhan defendants and the limited resources of CPCS, the\n\nnotice could not truthfully inform the Dookhan defendants that\n\nattorneys were available to represent them in these cases.    They\n\nasked the single justice to reserve and report to the full court\n\nthe question \"whether all cases involving misconduct by Annie\n\nDookhan should be dismissed or subjected to a court-ordered\n\ndeadline.\"   The district attorneys opposed the reservation and\n\nreport, arguing that the notices would provide all Dookhan\n\ndefendants the opportunity to seek relief.   They also contended\n\n\n\nWe need not resolve these differences and ascertain the precise\nnumber of relevant Dookhan defendants because, even if we were\nto adopt the district attorneys' estimates, there would still be\nclose to 20,000 relevant Dookhan defendants who might be\nentitled to postconviction relief.\n     12\n       For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to both the\nBridgeman I petitioners and CPCS as the \"Bridgeman petitioners\"\nfor the remainder of this opinion, even though we recognize that\nCPCS is an intervener rather than a petitioner in this case. We\nrefer to the \"Bridgeman petitioners\" because this is a civil\ncase seeking declaratory relief, even though we recognize that\nthe Bridgeman petitioners are each Dookhan defendants in\ncriminal cases.\n\f                                                                     21\n\n\nthat the Bridgeman petitioners \"significantly overstate[] the\n\napparent degree of interest on the part of the Dookhan\n\ndefendants in revisiting settled cases.\"    The single justice\n\nissued a reservation and report on August 16, 2016.\n\n    The district attorneys advised the single justice before\n\nthe issuance of the reservation and report that they intended to\n\nsend notices regardless of whether the case was reported to the\n\nfull court.   On August 29, 2016, the district attorneys filed in\n\nthe county court a letter attaching the notice they intended to\n\nsend on or before September 1.    The Bridgeman petitioners\n\ninformed the district attorneys that the notice was misleading\n\nand poorly translated.     At a hearing on September 6, the single\n\njustice invited the district attorneys to delay sending the\n\nnotice, but the district attorneys announced that the mailing\n\nhad already begun.   On September 7, CPCS filed an emergency\n\nmotion asking the full court to halt further dissemination of\n\nthe notice; the court denied the motion but ordered the district\n\nattorneys to keep records of all documents and communications\n\narising from the notice.\n\n    The notice was mailed in an envelope with the return\n\naddress of \"RG/2 Claims Administration LLC,\" and a post office\n\nbox in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, along with the words\n\n\"IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS\"\n\f                                                                    22\n\n\nnear the return address.13    The notice informed each defendant\n\nthat, according to court records, he or she was convicted of one\n\nor more drug offenses in a specified county between 2003 and\n\n2011; that it has been determined that Dookhan tested the drugs\n\nin the case; and that Dookhan \"admitted to misconduct in her\n\nwork at the [Hinton] lab.\"    It advised the defendant that,\n\nbecause Dookhan tested the evidence, he or she has certain\n\nrights, specifically, \"the right to challenge the drug\n\nconviction(s) listed in this notice\" and that \"if [the defendant\n\nis] tried and convicted again, [he or she] will not face any\n\npunishment greater than what [he or she] already received.\"    The\n\nnotice asked the defendant to contact his or her original lawyer\n\non the case if he or she has any questions, and also invited the\n\ndefendant to speak with a new lawyer.    The notice further\n\ninvited the defendant, should he or she not know how to contact\n\nthe original lawyer, to get that information at the criminal\n\nclerk's office where the case was adjudicated, and provided the\n\nWeb site address where the physical address of the relevant\n\ncourt can be found.14\n\n\n\n     13\n       RG/2 Claims Administration, LLC, is the vendor who\ncontracted with the district attorneys to distribute the notice.\n     14\n          The full English text of the notice is reprinted below:\n\n     \"Dear [recipient]:\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\n     A Spanish translation of the notice was included on the\n\nbottom of the page.     According to the Bridgeman petitioners,\n\nthis translation \"contained numerous errors and was not readily\n\nunderstandable to a person who speaks Spanish but not English.\"15\n\n\n\n     \"According to court records, you were convicted of one or\n     more drug offenses in the [county] between 2003 and 2011.\n     It has been determined that chemist Annie Dookhan tested\n     the drugs in your case(s), [court name], [docket number]\n\n     \"Ms. Dookhan admitted to misconduct in her work at the\n     [Hinton] lab.

O'Laughlin, a qualified Spanish\ninterpreter, who attested that \"the Spanish translation\ncontained within [the notice letter] is not accurate or clear.\"\nHe identified various flagrant errors in the translation of the\nnotice, including the following:\n\f                                                                   24\n\n\nThe district attorneys have not offered any evidence to rebut\n\nthese claims or to defend the quality of the translation.\n\n      The district attorneys' vendor mailed 20,916 letters to\n\nDookhan defendants.16   The vendor was unable to locate the\n\naddresses for 1,006 defendants, and 5,767 of the letters that\n\nwere sent were returned undelivered.   For those letters returned\n\nundelivered, the vendor searched for a secondary address and\n\nsent out an additional 964 notices.    As of October 24, 2016, the\n\nover-all response rate to these mailings was extremely low:\n\n     In the Bristol district, where approximately 2,200 cases\n      were identified, the district attorney received thirty-nine\n      telephone calls and three motions were filed.\n     In the Cape and Islands district, where approximately 1,300\n      cases were identified, the district attorney received\n      thirty-nine calls and one walk-in inquiry. No motions were\n      filed.\n     In the Essex district, where approximately 4,200 cases were\n      identified, the district attorney received forty-six\n      telephone calls and twelve walk-in inquiries. Seven\n      motions were filed.\n\n\n     The word \"vacated\" was translated in the notice as\n      \"desocupar,\" meaning to physically vacate premises, not to\n      vacate a judicial decision.\n     The verb tense in the same sentence was changed so that it\n      appeared that a successful motion may yield only the\n      possibility that the conviction would be vacated.\n     The translation of \"criminal clerk's office\" described a\n      clerk who is himself also a violent felon.\n\nO'Laughlin also described the translation of a crucial sentence\nin the notice explaining the district attorney's ability to\nretry the recipient's case as \"unintelligible.\"\n      16\n       Because some defendants had cases in multiple counties,\nthe number of letters that were mailed exceeded the number of\ndefendants identified in the lists.\n\f                                                                   25\n\n\n     In the Middlesex district, where approximately 3,500 cases\n      were identified, the district attorney received seventy-\n      seven telephone calls and seven walk-in inquiries. Two\n      motions were filed.\n     In the Norfolk district, where approximately 2,300 cases\n      were identified, the district attorney received\n      approximately one hundred inquiries. Seven motions were\n      filed.\n     In the Plymouth district, where approximately 2,000 cases\n      were identified, the district attorney received sixty-five\n      inquiries, including three walk-ins. One motion was filed.\n     In the Suffolk district, where approximately 8,600 cases\n      were identified, the district attorney received 322\n      telephone calls and walk-in inquiries. In response, the\n      office has moved to vacate and enter a nolle prosequi in\n      175 of these cases. No motions to withdraw a guilty plea\n      or admission to sufficient facts were filed by defendants.\n\nIn sum, in response to approximately 21,000 letters sent by the\n\nvendor to Dookhan defendants early in September, 2016, as of\n\nOctober 24, 2016, only twenty motions for postconviction relief\n\nwere filed by defendants and 175 motions were filed by\n\nprosecutors.   In other words, the notice triggered applications\n\nfor postconviction relief in less than one per cent of these\n\ncases.17\n\n\n      17\n       The Bridgeman petitioners have filed a motion to expand\nthe record to add an affidavit from Nancy J. Caplan, the CPCS\nattorney in charge of its Hinton lab crisis litigation unit\n(unit), which was created in April, 2013, to address indigent\ndefense matters relevant to the representation of Dookhan\ndefendants. Caplan attests that, after the district attorneys\nsent the notice, CPCS asked the courts in the eight affected\ncounties and all bar advocates to direct all inquiries arising\nfrom the notice to the unit so that CPCS could \"provide counsel\nto indigent Dookhan defendants so long as it had the resources\nnecessary to do so.\" She declares that, as of October 31, 2016,\nthe unit had received inquiries arising from the notice from 139\nDookhan defendants, who were defendants in 162 cases in which\nDookhan was the primary or confirmatory chemist.\n\f                                                                  26\n\n\n    Discussion.   The Bridgeman petitioners argue once again for\n\nthe global remedy that we declined in Bridgeman I, 471 Mass.\n\n487, to implement \"at this time.\"   They ask that we vacate the\n\ndrug convictions of all Dookhan defendants and dismiss them with\n\nprejudice or, in the alternative, vacate them without prejudice\n\nand allow prosecutors one year to reprosecute the cases,\n\ndismissing with prejudice all that are not reprosecuted within\n\none year for violation of the speedy trial rule, Mass. R. Crim.\n\nP. 36 (b) (1) (D), as amended, 422 Mass. 1503 (1996).    They\n\ncontend that due process requires such a global remedy because,\n\neven though four years have now passed since the scope of\n\nDookhan's misconduct was revealed, the defendants' entitlement\n\nto a new trial on their drug convictions has yet to be\n\nadjudicated in more than 24,000 cases.   They also contend that\n\nthe notice sent by prosecutors to these defendants was \"not a\n\nserious effort to ensure that wrongful convictions will be\n\n\n\n\n     The motion also seeks to expand the record to include a\n\"statement\" made by \"the District Attorneys for all of the\nCommonwealth's Districts\" in ten separate criminal cases in\nHampden County involving misconduct by another chemist, Sonja\nFarak, at the Department of Public Health's State Laboratory\nInstitute in Amherst. In that \"statement,\" the district\nattorneys inform the court that the Commonwealth will not\ncontest a finding of \"egregious governmental misconduct\" by\nFarak in performing her duties at that laboratory under the two-\nprong analysis set forth in Commonwealth v. Scott, 467 Mass. 336\n(2014). We allow the motion to expand the record, but recognize\nthat the full scope of Farak's misconduct has yet to be\ndetermined.\n\f                                                                  27\n\n\naddressed through case-by-case litigation,\" and was \"so\n\nmisleading and incomplete\" that its harm can be undone only by\n\nrelieving the defendants of the burdens of case-by-case\n\nlitigation.   They claim that a global remedy is a necessary\n\nexercise of our superintendence authority because a case-by-case\n\nadjudication of so many cases is \"doomed to fail\" given the\n\nlimited resources of the Commonwealth's indigent criminal\n\ndefense system.\n\n    The district attorneys respond that \"[t]here is no\n\nconvincing reason to retreat from the thoughtful remedies-based,\n\nworkable solution designed by the [c]ourt.\"   They contend that\n\nthe notice mailed to the Dookhan defendants was fair, and that\n\nthe low response to the notice reflects that many defendants\n\n\"may conclude that they face no adverse impact at all from a\n\nclosed chapter in their lives,\" and \"feel no urgency\" to reopen\n\ntheir case \"before an adverse impact actually occurs.\"    They\n\ncontend that, in light of the Dookhan defendants' response to\n\nthat notice, it is apparent that the Bridgeman petitioners have\n\ngreatly overstated the burden that will arise from case-by-case\n\nadjudication of motions for a new trial.   They also argue that\n\nwe should not vacate the convictions of Dookhan defendants who\n\nhave not moved to do so, because \"mass vacatur would constitute\n\na complete abandonment of the careful weighing of the interests\n\nof defendants, the public, and the criminal justice system that\n\f                                                                  28\n\n\nthis [c]ourt set out in Scott, and affirmed in [Bridgeman I] and\n\nthe cases that followed.\"   They contend that the remedy of\n\ndismissal with prejudice is not justified as a matter of law,\n\nand that the remedy of dismissal without prejudice, allowing the\n\nreprosecution of these cases, would be unfair to impose on\n\ndefendants who did not move for such relief, because it would\n\nsubject them without their approval to a new trial and the risk\n\nof arrest if they failed to appear.   In short, the district\n\nattorneys argue that we should stay the course, because\n\nindividual case-by-case adjudication of motions for a new trial\n\nbrought by Dookhan defendants is both practical and fair.\n\n    1.    Four relevant principles of our criminal justice\n\nsystem.   In Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 487, we recognized that\n\n\"we cannot expect defendants to bear the burden of a systemic\n\nlapse,\" but we declined to implement a global remedy \"at this\n\ntime\" because we would not \"allow the misconduct of one person\n\nto dictate an abrupt retreat from the fundamentals of our\n\ncriminal justice system\" (citation omitted).   In revisiting here\n\nwhether the time is now ripe to implement a global remedy, it is\n\nimportant to explain four relevant principles of our criminal\n\njustice system that have guided our prior decisions relating to\n\nthis matter.   First, where there is egregious misconduct\n\nattributable to the government in the investigation or\n\nprosecution of a criminal case, the government bears the burden\n\f                                                                    29\n\n\nof taking reasonable steps to remedy that misconduct.    See\n\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281 (1999) (discussing\n\n\"special role played by the American prosecutor in the search\n\nfor truth in criminal trials\" and broad duty to disclose\n\nexculpatory information); Bridgeman I, supra at 480-481.       Those\n\nreasonable steps include the obligation to timely and\n\neffectively notify the defendant of egregious misconduct\n\naffecting the defendant's criminal case.   See Ferrara, 456 F.3d\n\nat 293 (government's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to\n\ndefendant \"was so outrageous that it constituted impermissible\n\nprosecutorial misconduct sufficient to ground the petitioner's\n\nclaim that his guilty plea was involuntary\"); Mass. R. Prof. C.\n\n3.8 (d), as appearing in 473 Mass. 1301 (2016) (\"The prosecutor\n\nin a criminal case shall . . . make timely disclosure to the\n\ndefense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor\n\nthat tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the\n\noffense . . .\").\n\n    As applied here, prosecutors had a responsibility timely\n\nand effectively to disclose Dookhan's misconduct to all affected\n\ndefendants because Dookhan might erroneously have found\n\nsubstances that were not controlled substances to be a\n\ncontrolled substance, or to be a certain weight, creating the\n\nrisk that a defendant may have been found guilty of a drug crime\n\nhe or she did not commit.   In addition, her egregious misconduct\n\f                                                                   30\n\n\nput in question the accuracy of the drug analysis and the\n\nability of the government to prove the nature and weight of the\n\nalleged drugs beyond a reasonable doubt, which a defendant is\n\nentitled to consider in making an informed and voluntary\n\ndecision whether to waive the right to trial and plead guilty\n\n(or admit to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt), or\n\nto proceed to trial.   The cost of notifying defendants of\n\negregious government misconduct must be borne by the prosecuting\n\ndistrict attorney's office, even if, as here, the fault belongs\n\nto the Hinton lab and Dookhan, not the prosecutors.\n\n    Second, under our criminal rules, relief from a conviction\n\ngenerally requires the defendant to file a motion for a new\n\ntrial.   See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass.\n\n1501 (2001) (judge \"upon motion in writing may grant a new trial\n\nat any time if it appears that justice may not have been done\"\n\n[emphasis added]).   See also Scott, 467 Mass. at 354.    \"A new\n\ntrial motion under Rule 30(b) is the appropriate vehicle to\n\nattack the validity of a guilty plea or an admission to\n\nsufficient facts.\"   Reporters' Notes to Rule 30 (b), Mass. Ann.\n\nLaws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1774\n\n(LexisNexis 2016).\n\n    Third, dismissal with prejudice \"is a remedy of last\n\nresort.\"   Commonwealth v. Cronk, 396 Mass. 194, 198 (1985).\n\nWhere a motion for a new trial is allowed, the conviction is\n\f                                                                       31\n\n\nvacated, and the prosecutor may retry the defendant on the same\n\ncharge, unless the judge, apart from the vacatur, also dismisses\n\nthe complaint or indictment with prejudice.       We have identified\n\n\"[t]wo parallel legal principles\" governing when this last\n\nresort might be necessary, balancing the rights of defendants\n\n\"against the necessity for preserving society's interest in the\n\nadministration of justice.\"     Id. at 198-199.   Under one legal\n\nprinciple, where a prosecutor fails to disclose evidence the\n\ndefendant is entitled to receive and the defendant is prejudiced\n\nby the failure to disclose, a motion to dismiss with prejudice\n\nshould be allowed only where there is \"a showing of irremediable\n\nharm to the defendant's opportunity to obtain a fair trial.\"\n\nId. at 198.   Dismissal with prejudice is \"too drastic a remedy\"\n\nif the error can be remedied and the defendant can still obtain\n\na fair trial.   Id. at 200, and cases cited.\n\n    \"Under the alternative principle, prosecutorial misconduct\n\nthat is egregious, deliberate, and intentional, or that results\n\nin a violation of constitutional rights may give rise to\n\npresumptive prejudice.   In such instances prophylactic\n\nconsiderations may assume paramount importance and the 'drastic\n\nremedy' of dismissal of charges may become an appropriate\n\nremedy.\"   Id. at 198-199.    This alternative principle is\n\nnarrowly applied; \"the only reason to dismiss criminal charges\n\nbecause of nonprejudicial but egregious police misconduct would\n\f                                                                  32\n\n\nbe to create a climate adverse to repetition of that misconduct\n\nthat would not otherwise exist.\"   Commonwealth v. Lewin, 405\n\nMass. 566, 587 (1989).\n\n    We dismissed drug charges with prejudice based on both\n\nalternative grounds where two special agents of the United\n\nStates Drug Enforcement Administration spoke after arraignment\n\nwith the defendant without the approval of defense counsel,\n\ndisparaged defense counsel and the manner in which he was\n\nconducting the defense, and encouraged the defendant to\n\ncooperate with Federal authorities.   Commonwealth v. Manning,\n\n373 Mass. 438, 440 (1977).   We concluded that this was \"a\n\ndeliberate and intentional attack by government agents on the\n\nrelationship between Manning and his counsel in a calculated\n\nattempt to coerce the defendant into abandoning his defense,\"\n\nid. at 443, and that \"the officers' misconduct was so pervasive\n\nas to preclude any confident assumption that proceedings at a\n\nnew trial would be free of the taint,\" id. at 444.   We also\n\nconcluded that a \"stronger deterrent\" than a new trial was\n\nwarranted for this type of misconduct.   Id.\n\n    In Scott and Francis, the remedy that we found appropriate\n\nin cases where a defendant shows prejudice arising from\n\nDookhan's misconduct was the allowance of a motion for a new\n\ntrial and the vacatur of the conviction.   We did not order the\n\ndismissal of the defendant's drug charges with prejudice, or\n\f                                                                     33\n\n\nsuggest that was an appropriate remedy for Dookhan's misconduct\n\nunder either of the alternative legal principles.     Although the\n\nrecord does not provide us with data as to the number of\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants who were reprosecuted after their\n\nmotions for a new trial were allowed, we are aware that some\n\ndefendants were retried and that other defendants later pleaded\n\nguilty or admitted to sufficient facts to support a guilty\n\nfinding.\n\n    Fourth, where large numbers of persons have been wronged,\n\nthe wrong must be remedied in a manner that is not only fair as\n\na matter of justice, but also timely and practical.     Cf. Green\n\nv. County School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 439\n\n(1968) (in redressing school desegregation, school board must\n\n\"come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work,\n\nand promises to realistically work now\").   A remedy that is\n\nperfect in theory is not perfect in fact if it would take too\n\nlong to be accomplished, or if the resources required to\n\nimplement it would overwhelm the limited resources available to\n\nthe courts.   See Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 786\n\n(9th Cir. 1996) (affirming special master's award of\n\ncompensatory damages based on statistical methods to determine\n\namount owed to class of nearly 10,000 victims and survivors of\n\ndecedents who were tortured, executed, or \"disappeared\" by\n\nPhilippine military or paramilitary groups during fourteen-year\n\f                                                                   34\n\n\nrule of Ferdinand E. Marcos where \"the time and judicial\n\nresources required to try the nearly 10,000 claims in this case\n\nwould alone make resolution of Hilao's claims impossible\").\n\nEven when the number of persons injured is large and the problem\n\nis complex, courts endeavor to craft a workable remedy; we do\n\nnot throw up our hands and deny relief because it would be too\n\ndifficult to accomplish.   Cf. Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511\n\n(2011) (in addressing prison overcrowding, \"[c]ourts may not\n\nallow constitutional violations to continue simply because a\n\nremedy would involve intrusion into the realm of [executive]\n\nadministration\"); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,\n\n402 U.S. 1, 28 (1971) (when altering school attendance zones to\n\nprevent racial segregation, \"all awkwardness and inconvenience\n\ncannot be avoided in the interim period when remedial\n\nadjustments are being made\").   Over the course of its history,\n\nour judiciary has devised ways to provide redress to widespread\n\nwrongs through such vehicles as class actions, derivative\n\nactions, the consolidation of multiple related cases, and the\n\nappointment of special masters and receivers.   See, e.g., Mass.\n\nR. Civ. P. 23, as amended, 471 Mass. 1491 (2015) (class\n\nactions); Mass. R. Civ. P. 23.1, 365 Mass. 768 (1974)\n\n(derivative actions by shareholders); Mass. R. Civ. P. 42, as\n\namended, 423 Mass. 1406 (1996) (case consolidation); Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 53, as amended, 423 Mass. 1408 (1996) (appointment of\n\f                                                                   35\n\n\nspecial master).   In short, we as a judiciary must and do find\n\nways to make justice not only fair but workable.    See Demoulas\n\nv. Demoulas, 428 Mass. 555, 580 (1998), citing 1 D. Dobbs,\n\nRemedies § 2.1(3), at 63 (2d ed. 1993) (\"Equitable remedies are\n\nflexible tools to be applied with the focus on fairness and\n\njustice\").\n\n    2.   Revisiting the need for a global remedy.   We now\n\nconsider, in light of all that has happened and all that we have\n\nlearned since Bridgeman I, whether we should revisit our\n\ndecision to decline to adopt a global remedy \"at this time\" to\n\nresolve the cases of the relevant Dookhan defendants.\n\nBridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 487.\n\n    a.   The district attorneys' proposal to stay the course.\n\nThe district attorneys contend that our previous decisions have\n\nprovided an adequate remedy to the relevant Dookhan defendants.\n\nThis argument relies on the key premise that the notice mailed\n\nto the Dookhan defendants adequately informed them that\n\nDookhan's misconduct affected their criminal case and that, as a\n\nresult, they may seek to vacate their drug conviction.\n\n    We reject this premise; we agree with the Bridgeman\n\npetitioners that the notice sent by the district attorneys was\n\nwholly inadequate to provide the relevant Dookhan defendants\n\nwith the information necessary to knowingly and voluntarily\n\ndecide whether they should explore with counsel the possibility\n\f                                                                  36\n\n\nof withdrawing their plea or moving for a new trial.   The\n\nshortcomings begin with the envelope itself, which identified\n\nthe source of the letter as \"RG/2 Claims Administration LLC,\" a\n\nsource that would appear inconsistent with the words on the\n\nenvelope, \"IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF\n\nMASSACHUSETTS.\"   Such an envelope invites the risk that the\n\nnotice might be unopened and discarded as \"junk mail.\"\n\n     Among the shortcomings of the letter itself are that it\n\nfailed adequately to inform the Dookhan defendants that the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court has determined that they are entitled to\n\na conclusive presumption that the drug analysis in their case\n\nwas tainted by egregious government misconduct.   Nor did it\n\nadequately inform them that, as a result, this court has\n\ndetermined that they are entitled to withdraw their guilty plea18\n\non drug charges if they can show a reasonable probability that\n\nthey would not have pleaded guilty, and instead would have\n\ndecided to go to trial, had they known of Dookhan's misconduct.\n\n     18\n       We recognize that recipients of the letter include both\nindividuals who pleaded guilty to Dookhan-related charges and\nthose who admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a guilty\nfinding. Because such an admission is the \"functional\nequivalent of a guilty plea\" under G. L. c. 278, § 29D, and\nbecause it exposes a defendant to some of the same collateral\nconsequences as a guilty plea, see Commonwealth v. Villalobos,\n437 Mass. 797, 800 (2002), we treat the admission the same as a\nguilty plea for the purposes of a motion for new trial. Luk v.\nCommonwealth, 421 Mass. 415, 418 n.6 (1995). In the remaining\ndiscussion we refer to a guilty plea and an admission to\nsufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty, collectively,\nas a \"guilty plea.\" See Scott, 467 Mass. at 337 n.1.\n\f                                                                  37\n\n\nNor did it adequately inform them that, if they had been\n\nconvicted of a drug charge at trial, they are entitled to a new\n\ntrial if the admission in evidence of their drug analysis might\n\nhave significantly influenced the jury in reaching their\n\nverdict.     The letter explained that, if their challenge to their\n\ndrug conviction were to succeed, their conviction would be\n\nvacated and their \"case will be returned to active status,\" but\n\ndid not explain what it meant for their case to be on \"active\n\nstatus.\"19    The Spanish translation of the letter is so poor that\n\nthe letter might not be understood by persons who speak only\n\nSpanish.\n\n     The letter also failed to inform the Dookhan defendants\n\nthat they had a right to counsel if they sought to withdraw\n\ntheir plea or move for a new trial and that, if they could not\n\nafford counsel, one would be appointed for them.    Instead, it\n\ninvited them to speak to their original lawyer on the case and,\n\nif they did not know how to contact that lawyer, invited them to\n\nobtain that information from the relevant criminal clerk's\n\noffice.20    The letter also invited them to contact the office of\n\nthe district attorney who prosecuted them \"[f]or more\n\n     19\n       The letter did explain that, if the district attorney\ndecided to try them again on the vacated drug charge, they would\nnot face punishment greater than what they had earlier received\nif they were convicted.\n     20\n       The letter also told recipients that they \"may also\nchoose to speak to a new lawyer.\"\n\f                                                                  38\n\n\ninformation.\"   It did not provide a telephone number for CPCS or\n\nfor any other entity that conducts criminal defense.\n\n    Apart from the deficiencies in the notice, we know that a\n\nsubstantial number of the Dookhan defendants did not receive the\n\nletter, because 5,767 were returned as undeliverable.   An\n\nadditional 964 notices were sent to secondary addresses for\n\nthese individuals in an attempt to locate them, but we do not\n\nknow how many of these letters were returned as undeliverable.\n\nNo public notice, either through the newspaper, television, or\n\nsocial media, was attempted to provide notice to those whose\n\ncurrent address could not be located.\n\n    We are skeptical of the district attorneys' explanation\n\nthat so few of the Dookhan defendants chose to respond to the\n\nletter because most were not interested in \"reopening a closed\n\nchapter in their lives before an adverse impact actually occurs\"\n\nand others believed that \"they face no adverse impact at all\"\n\nfrom this conviction.   We recognize that few, if any, of the\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants continue to be incarcerated on a\n\ndrug conviction tainted by Dookhan's misconduct, but that does\n\nnot mean that they lack a strong reason to seek to have this\n\nconviction vacated, given the serious and pervasive collateral\n\nconsequences that arise from a drug conviction.   A noncitizen,\n\neven one lawfully residing in this country, who is convicted of\n\nany crime \"relating to a controlled substance,\" which includes\n\f                                                                     39\n\n\nthe crime of possession of heroin, cocaine, or more than thirty\n\ngrams of marijuana, is \"deportable.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1227(2)(B)(i)\n\n(2012).   See Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 368 (2010);\n\nCommonwealth v. DeJesus, 468 Mass. 174, 175 (2014).     All\n\npersons, including United States citizens, who are convicted of\n\ndrug crimes may be barred from public housing and from Federal-\n\nand State-subsidized private housing.   See 42 U.S.C. § 13661\n\n(2012); 24 C.F.R. §§ 960.204(a)(1), 982.553(a)(1), (2)(ii);\n\nG. L. c. 121B, § 32 (State-funded public housing); 760 Code\n\nMass. Regs. § 5.08(1)(d) (1996); 760 Code Mass. Regs.\n\n§ 49.03(2)(f) (2012) (Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program); 803\n\nCode Mass. Regs. § 5.04 (2012).   A drug conviction may bar a\n\ndefendant from many categories of jobs and professional\n\nlicenses.   See, e.g., G. L. c. 6, §§ 172 (c), 172A-172M.     See\n\nalso Commonwealth v. Pon, 469 Mass. 296, 317 (2014) (collateral\n\nconsequences include homelessness and unemployment).    It may\n\nalso prevent a defendant from receiving government benefits such\n\nas cash assistance and unemployment benefits.   See G. L.\n\nc. 151A, § 25 (e) (unemployment benefits); 106 Code Mass. Regs.\n\n§ 701.110(D) (2016) (cash assistance under transitional aid to\n\nfamilies with dependent children program).   And it may render a\n\nstudent temporarily ineligible for Federal financial aid,\n\nthereby diminishing a defendant's ability to attend college.        20\n\nU.S.C. § 1091(r)(1) (2012).   A conviction of drug trafficking\n\f                                                                   40\n\n\nresults in the automatic suspension of the defendant's driver's\n\nlicense, which makes it more difficult to find and keep\n\nemployment.     G. L. c. 90, § 22½, inserted by St. 2016, c. 64,\n\n§ 1.    A prior drug conviction may also result in a lengthy\n\nminimum mandatory sentence for those subsequently convicted of\n\nadditional drug offenses, G. L. c. 94C, §§ 32 (b), 32A (b),\n\n32B (b), 32C (b), 32D (b), 34, or of the illegal possession of a\n\nfirearm.     G. L. c. 269, § 10G.   In short, the adverse\n\nconsequences of an unjust conviction do not end when one\n\ncompletes a jail or prison term, or a probationary period.\n\nGiven the inadequacy of the notice provided by the district\n\nattorneys, the remarkably low response to that notice, and the\n\nsevere collateral consequences of drug convictions, justice and\n\nfairness do not permit us simply to stay the course set in\n\nBridgeman I.\n\n       b.   The Bridgeman petitioners' proposal for a global\n\nremedy.     The Bridgeman petitioners contend that, even with\n\nadequate notice, no remedy premised on case-by-case adjudication\n\ncan work.    They argue that, because of the severely limited\n\nresources of CPCS -- the amount of State funding, the number of\n\nqualified bar advocates, and the legislative limits on the\n\nnumber of hours that bar advocates annually may bill to CPCS --\n\nCPCS cannot possibly assign qualified counsel to represent all\n\nthe defendants who would file the postconviction motions that\n\f                                                                   41\n\n\nwould result from truly adequate notice.   They therefore contend\n\nthat it is both illusory and misleading to inform defendants\n\nthat, if they are indigent, counsel will be assigned to\n\nrepresent them, where that will simply not be possible.     They\n\ncontend that the only just and practical alternative under these\n\ncircumstances is the global remedy they propose, in which we\n\nwould vacate the drug convictions of all relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants and dismiss them with prejudice, or dismiss them\n\nwithout prejudice and allow prosecutors one year to reprosecute\n\nthese cases before they, too, would be dismissed with prejudice.\n\n    The proposed global remedy, however, is neither as just nor\n\nas practical as the Bridgeman petitioners claim, and it would be\n\ninconsistent with some of the principles that we earlier\n\narticulated.   In Scott and Francis, we granted relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants a conclusive presumption of egregious government\n\nmisconduct, but we did not grant them a conclusive presumption\n\nof prejudice; defendants still bore the burden of proving\n\nprejudice.   Where a relevant Dookhan defendant filed a motion to\n\nwithdraw a plea or for a new trial, and failed to prove\n\nprejudice, the motion was denied.   The global remedy proposed by\n\nthe Bridgeman petitioners would effectively declare a conclusive\n\npresumption of prejudice.\n\n    Even where a relevant Dookhan defendant proved prejudice,\n\nthe defendant only obtained a new trial under Scott and Francis,\n\f                                                                    42\n\n\nnot a dismissal with prejudice.   Dookhan's conduct, serious as\n\nit was, did not result in \"irremediable harm to the defendant's\n\nopportunity to obtain a fair trial.\"    Cronk, 396 Mass. at 198.\n\nRather, it meant that the Commonwealth had to retest the\n\nsubstance claimed to be a controlled substance and offer\n\nevidence of that new drug analysis at a retrial, or otherwise\n\nprove that the substance possessed or distributed by the\n\ndefendant was a controlled substance.   Nor, given the absence of\n\nany evidence of misconduct by a prosecutor or investigator, did\n\nwe place Dookhan's misconduct in the category that requires a\n\nstronger deterrent than a new trial to avoid the risk of\n\nrepetition.   See Lewin, 405 Mass. at 587; Manning, 373 Mass. at\n\n444.   A dismissal with prejudice for government misconduct is\n\nvery strong medicine, and it should be prescribed only when the\n\ngovernment misconduct is so intentional and so egregious that a\n\nnew trial is not an adequate remedy.    We did not prescribe this\n\nmedicine in Scott and Francis, and we are not convinced that it\n\nis appropriate to do so now.   And if we were to prescribe it\n\nnow, we would equitably have to address the claims of those who\n\nearlier prevailed in proving prejudice and therefore won a new\n\ntrial, but not a dismissal with prejudice, and subsequently\n\neither again pleaded guilty to the same or lesser charges or\n\nwere convicted at a new trial of the drug charges.    They could\n\f                                                                   43\n\n\njustly contend that they are as entitled to a dismissal with\n\nprejudice as are those who did not move for a new trial.\n\n    To vacate the convictions of all relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants without prejudice would present other problems of\n\njustice and practicality.   We require a defendant to move for a\n\nnew trial for a reason -- without a motion, we cannot be sure\n\nthat a defendant wishes to accept the risk that the Commonwealth\n\nwill retry the defendant rather than issue a nolle prosequi.\n\nEven though, as a result of our decision in Bridgeman I, 471\n\nMass. at 477, a defendant at a new trial would not be risking\n\nconviction of a more serious crime or a longer sentence, a\n\ndefendant who is retried would still have to appear in court\n\nwhen directed by the judge and endure the uncertainty and\n\ndisruption inherent in being a defendant in a criminal trial.\n\nWe might be skeptical of the district attorneys' contention that\n\nmost of the relevant Dookhan defendants do not wish to reopen \"a\n\nclosed chapter in their lives,\" but it would not be surprising\n\nif some defendants have no wish to relitigate their earlier\n\ncriminal cases and instead simply want to move on with their\n\nlives.\n\n    Although we reject the global remedy proposed by the\n\nBridgeman petitioners, we accept two premises of their argument.\n\nFirst, in light of the unusual circumstances of the relevant\n\nDookhan defendants, all who are indigent and wish to explore\n\f                                                                  44\n\n\nwhether to move for a new trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b)\n\nare entitled to appointed counsel.   We recognize that we have\n\ndeclared that \"an indigent defendant does not have an absolute\n\nright under any provision of the United States Constitution or\n\nthe Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to appointed counsel in\n\npreparing or presenting his motion for a new trial.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Conceicao, 388 Mass. 255, 261 (1983).    But we\n\nhave also declared that the State must \"ensure that indigent\n\ndefendants have meaningful access to this postconviction\n\nproceeding,\" id., and that, \"when a defendant presents a motion\n\nfor a new trial which raises a colorable or meritorious issue,\n\n'it is much the better practice to assign counsel.'\"     Id. at\n\n262, quoting Dillon v. United States, 307 F.2d 445, 448 (9th\n\nCir. 1962).\n\n    Generally, the decision whether to appoint counsel to\n\nrepresent a defendant in preparing and presenting a motion for a\n\nnew trial rests with the sound discretion of the motion judge.\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (5), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501\n\n(2001).   But in the exercise of that discretion a judge should\n\nappoint counsel where the failure to do so would deprive an\n\nindigent defendant \"of meaningful access\" or result in\n\n\"fundamental unfairness.\"   Conceicao, supra at 262, citing Ross\n\nv. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 616 (1974), and Lassiter v. Department\n\nof Social Servs., 452 U.S. 18, 24-25 (1981).\n\f                                                                   45\n\n\n    Here, all of the relevant Dookhan defendants who move for a\n\nnew trial are entitled under our decision in Scott to a\n\nconclusive presumption of egregious government misconduct.     The\n\ndistrict attorneys concede that, given the number of relevant\n\nDookhan defendants, we have the authority under our\n\nsuperintendence power to order that each relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendant who is indigent is entitled to the assignment of\n\ncounsel.   We so order; we need not wait for each motion judge to\n\nrule individually on the question of the assignment of counsel\n\nwhere it is plain that the absence of counsel under these\n\nunusual circumstances would deny an indigent defendant\n\n\"meaningful access\" or result in \"fundamental unfairness,\" and\n\ntherefore deprive the defendant of his or her constitutional\n\nrights to due process and to counsel.   The right to appointed\n\ncounsel applies here regardless of whether the relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendant has completed his or her sentence, because the severe\n\ncollateral consequences arising from a drug conviction do not\n\nend at the conclusion of a defendant's sentence.\n\n    Moreover, where an indigent criminal defendant has a right\n\nto counsel, \"[t]he duty to provide such counsel falls squarely\n\non government, and the burden of a systemic lapse is not to be\n\nborne by defendants.\"   Lavallee v. Justices in the Hampden\n\nSuperior Court, 442 Mass. 228, 246 (2004).   Where a judge finds\n\nthat a criminal defendant has a right to counsel and is indigent\n\f                                                                   46\n\n\n(or indigent but able to contribute), the judge assigns CPCS to\n\nprovide representation for the party.    S.J.C. Rule 3:10, § 6, as\n\nappearing in 475 Mass. 1301 (2016).     G. L. c. 211D, § 5 (CPCS\n\n\"shall establish, supervise and maintain a system for the\n\nappointment or assignment of counsel\" at any stage of criminal\n\nproceeding where there is right to counsel and defendant is\n\nindigent).   If CPCS, despite its best efforts, were unable to\n\nassign counsel to a defendant in a reasonably timely manner --\n\nwhether the reason be the absence of necessary funding by the\n\nLegislature, the inability of CPCS to qualify adequate numbers\n\nof private attorneys to serve as bar advocates because of the\n\nlow hourly fee mandated by the Legislature,21 the unavailability\n\nof qualified bar advocates because of the limitation on the\n\n\n\n\n     21\n       The present statutory hourly rate for bar advocates is\nfifty-three dollars for cases in the District Court and the\nBoston Municipal Court, and sixty dollars for nonhomicide cases\nin the Superior Court. G. L. c. 211D, § 11 (a). The only\nchange to these hourly rates since 2005 has been that the rate\napplicable for cases in the District Court and Boston Municipal\nCourt was increased from fifty dollars to fifty-three dollars in\n2015. See St. 2015, c. 46, § 119.\n\f                                                                  47\n\n\nnumber of hours they may bill annually,22 or a systemic overload\n\ncreated by an overwhelming number of relevant Dookhan defendants\n\nfiling motions for a new trial (or the combination of all four\n\nreasons) -- we would have to fashion an appropriate remedy under\n\nour general superintendence authority for the constitutional\n\nviolation suffered by indigent criminal defendants.    See\n\nLavallee, supra at 244.   In Lavallee, where the list of CPCS-\n\nqualified attorneys available to accept assignments in Hampden\n\nCounty was inadequate to ensure the provision of counsel to\n\nthose with a right to counsel, the remedy we ordered was that a\n\ncriminal case against an indigent defendant must be dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice if an attorney had not filed an appearance\n\nwithin forty-five days of arraignment.   Id. at 246.\n\n     We recognize that, if a substantial percentage of relevant\n\nDookhan defendants were to seek postconviction relief after\n\n\n     22\n       The annual cap on billable hours for bar advocates is\n1,650 hours, and a bar advocate may not accept any new\nappointment in a nonhomicide case after having billed 1,350\nhours in that fiscal year. G. L. c. 211D, § 11 (b), (c). In\n2016, in response to a shortage of bar advocates in care and\nprotection cases and children and family law cases, the\nLegislature enacted legislation allowing the chief counsel of\nCPCS, under certain circumstances, to waive the annual cap on\nbillable hours for bar advocates assigned to these cases,\nprovided that such a bar advocate not bill in excess of 1,800\nbillable hours for the year. G. L. c. 211D, § 11(d), amended\nthrough St. 2016, c. 133, § 119. A comparable increase in the\nannual cap on billable hours potentially could be enacted for\nbar advocates assigned to criminal cases or, alternatively, the\ntime devoted to the representation of relevant Dookhan\ndefendants could be exempted from the annual cap.\n\f                                                                      48\n\n\nreceiving truly adequate notice, the capacity of CPCS to assign\n\nqualified attorneys to represent these defendants in case-by-\n\ncase adjudication would soon be overwhelmed.   Therefore, unless\n\nthe district attorneys were to move to vacate and dismiss with\n\nprejudice the drug convictions of large numbers of relevant\n\nDookhan defendants, case-by-case adjudication poses the\n\nconsiderable risk that the demand of indigent Dookhan defendants\n\nfor counsel might outstrip the supply of CPCS-qualified\n\nattorneys to represent them, and require this court to implement\n\nan appropriate remedy under our general superintendence\n\nauthority for the constitutional violation suffered by indigent\n\ncriminal defendants who are denied their right to counsel.       If\n\npast is prologue, that remedy will likely be the dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice of their challenged drug convictions.       See\n\nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 246.\n\n    c.   New protocol for case-by-case adjudication.    The\n\nextraordinary magnitude of Dookhan's misconduct has left us with\n\nonly poor alternatives.    We continue to believe that, despite\n\nits considerable risks and burdens, case-by-case adjudication is\n\nthe fairest and best alternative to resolve the drug cases\n\npotentially tainted by Dookhan's misconduct and the alternative\n\nmost consistent and in harmony with the relevant principles of\n\ncriminal justice that have and continue to guide us in this\n\nextraordinary situation.    But we recognize that, in light of the\n\f                                                                  49\n\n\npotential need to adjudicate more than 20,000 motions for a new\n\ntrial brought by the relevant Dookhan defendants, case-by-case\n\nadjudication must be adapted to make it both fair and workable.\n\n     The success of case-by-case adjudication will depend on the\n\ncooperation of the district attorneys, who will have to examine\n\neach drug conviction of each relevant Dookhan defendant in their\n\ndistrict and determine which cases they reasonably could and\n\nwould reprosecute if a motion for a new trial were granted, and\n\nmove to vacate and dismiss with prejudice the rest.23   We rely on\n\nthe exercise of the district attorneys' sound discretion to\n\nreduce substantially the number of relevant Dookhan defendants.\n\nWe note that it appears that the majority of the drug\n\nconvictions of relevant Dookhan defendants were of possession\n\n\n\n\n     23\n       In a letter to the Governor on September 6, 2012, after\nlearning of the investigation of the Hinton lab, the district\nattorneys declared, \"If there has been any miscarriage of\njustice due to the actions of Annie Dookhan or anyone else at\nthe [Hinton lab], correcting those miscarriages must be the\nfirst priority.\" Press Release, MDAA Letter to Gov. Patrick Re:\nDPH Drug Lab, State House News Serv. (Sept. 11, 2012). At oral\nargument, the district attorneys similarly assured the court\nthat they will exercise their sound discretion in handling\nmotions for a new trial brought by the relevant Dookhan\ndefendants.\n\f                                                                  50\n\n\nalone,24 that approximately ninety per cent of these convictions\n\nwere obtained in the District Court or in the Boston Municipal\n\nCourt (which means that the drug charges were either\n\nmisdemeanors or felonies for which the district attorney did not\n\nchoose to seek indictments), and that virtually all of these\n\ndefendants have already served the entirety of their sentences\n\nfor these drug convictions.\n\n     Its success also depends on the cooperation of CPCS, which\n\nwill have to make best efforts in using the funding appropriated\n\nby the Legislature to assign counsel to the relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants who, after new notice, choose to explore the filing\n\nof a motion for a new trial.   We look to CPCS also for its\n\ncreativity and ingenuity in finding ways to assign attorneys to\n\nrepresent as many relevant Dookhan defendants as is reasonably\n\npossible.\n\n     To accomplish case-by-case adjudication of the drug cases\n\nof potentially more than 20,000 relevant Dookhan defendants, we\n\nestablish the following protocol, to be completed in three\n\n\n\n\n     24\n       An analysis conducted by Paola Villarreal, a data science\nfellow at the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of\nMassachusetts, revealed that approximately sixty-two per cent of\nthe adverse drug dispositions for Dookhan defendants were for\npossession alone. At oral argument, in answer to a question\nposed by a Justice, a prosecutor stated that he \"[did] not know\"\nwhether a majority of these cases were for \"straight\npossession.\"\n\f                                                                     51\n\n\nphases, and order its implementation by the single justice in\n\nthe form of a declaratory judgment.\n\n     i.   Phase one.   Upon the issuance of this opinion, each\n\ndistrict attorney shall commence an individualized review of\n\nevery Dookhan case in his or her district that was included on\n\nthe list that the district attorney earlier submitted to the\n\nsingle justice.   No later than ninety days after the issuance of\n\nthis opinion, each district attorney shall file three letters\n\nwith the county clerk.25\n\n     The first letter shall identify all defendants on the list\n\nwho are not relevant Dookhan defendants because they pleaded\n\nguilty to a drug charge before Dookhan signed the drug\n\ncertification and therefore are not entitled to the conclusive\n\npresumption of egregious government misconduct.     In short, this\n\nletter shall identify all of the so-called Ruffin defendants.\n\nSee Ruffin, 475 Mass. at 1003.\n\n     The second letter shall identify all of the drug\n\nconvictions on the list that the district attorney moves to\n\nvacate and dismiss with prejudice as a result of his or her\n\nindividualized review.     These shall include both the convictions\n\nthat the district attorney wishes to vacate and dismiss with\n\nprejudice, regardless of whether the case could be successfully\n\n     25\n       We recognize the difference between the date of the\nissuance of our opinion and the date of the rescript, and have\nspecifically selected the former as the starting date.\n\f                                                                     52\n\n\nreprosecuted if a new trial were ordered, and the convictions\n\nthat the district attorney could not successfully reprosecute if\n\na new trial were ordered.    Once these drug convictions are\n\nvacated and dismissed with prejudice, the defendants shall be\n\nnotified of the action taken.26\n\n     The third letter shall identify all drug convictions on the\n\nlist that the district attorney does not move to vacate and\n\ndismiss with prejudice.     For each such conviction, the district\n\nattorney shall certify that, if a motion for a new trial were\n\nallowed, the district attorney could produce evidence at a\n\nretrial, independent of Dookhan's signed drug certificate or\n\ntestimony, sufficient to permit a rational jury to find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the substance at issue was the controlled\n\nsubstance alleged in the complaint or indictment.     Such\n\nindependent evidence may include, for example, retesting of the\n\noriginal drug evidence, a positive field test, or a specific\n\nadmission by the defendant regarding his or her knowledge of the\n\nnature of the substance that was made before Dookhan signed the\n\ndrug certificate in the case.     Only the relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants identified in the third letter shall be provided with\n\nnew notice in phase two, discussed infra.\n\n     26\n       Where a defendant pleaded guilty to multiple charges at a\nplea hearing or was convicted at trial of multiple counts, the\nvacatur of these drug convictions with prejudice will not affect\nany nondrug convictions or any drug convictions where Dookhan\nwas not the primary or confirmatory analyst.\n\f                                                                  53\n\n\n     In light of the massive number of relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants and the scope of misconduct attributable to the\n\ngovernment (albeit not to the prosecutors), it is only fair that\n\ndistrict attorneys make an individualized determination whether\n\na conviction warrants burdening the court system with the\n\nadjudication of a motion for a new trial, CPCS with the\n\nassignment of counsel for those who are indigent, and the\n\ntaxpayers with payment for the notice and for assigned counsel,\n\nespecially where a defendant has already served the entirety of\n\nthe sentence.   A substantial vetting of the relevant cases by\n\nthe district attorneys will allow our criminal justice system to\n\nfocus its limited resources where they are most needed, and\n\ndiminish the risk that the number of these cases will so\n\noverwhelm CPCS that the single justice will have to act to\n\nprotect the relevant Dookhan defendants' right to counsel.27\n\n\n     27\n       Our focus in the phase one protocol on whether the\nCommonwealth could obtain a drug conviction against the relevant\nDookhan defendants with evidence untainted by Dookhan's\nmisconduct is comparable to the approach taken by New Jersey\ncourts following revelations of misconduct by a police officer\nwho made numerous drunk driving arrests. In State v. Gookins,\n135 N.J. 42, 44-45 (1994), three defendants moved to vacate\ntheir guilty pleas for driving while under the influence of\nalcohol after the police officer involved in their arrests and\nthe administration of their breathalyzer tests was convicted of\nfalsifying the result of the breathalyzer test he had performed\non an undercover agent, and of stealing money from drivers whom\nhe had stopped. The defendants had pleaded guilty in reliance\non the results of their breathalyzer tests. Id. at 45. The New\nJersey Supreme Court vacated their convictions and issued an\norder requiring the prosecution to certify to the trial court\n\f                                                                   54\n\n\n     ii.   Phase two.   In the second phase of the protocol, no\n\nlater than thirty days after the expiration of the ninety-day\n\nperiod in phase one, new notice shall be provided to all\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants identified in the district\n\nattorneys' third letters.    The notice shall consist of a mailing\n\nthat is approved by the single justice as to its content, its\n\nenvelope, and its mode of delivery.28   The single justice shall\n\nalso have the authority to order additional forms of public\n\nnotice, such as through newspapers or social media, to enhance\n\nthe effectiveness of the mailing and to attempt to reach those\n\nwho might not receive it.\n\n\n\n\n\"all the evidence that it considers to be untainted that would\nsustain the prosecution of these cases, . . . excluding the\ntestimony of [the convicted officer].\" Id. at 51. The trial\ncourt was instructed to hold a hearing \"to determine whether\nsuch evidence is sufficient to permit the State to proceed with\nthe case.\" Id. at 52. In a separate class action in the United\nStates District Court, the State consented to the appointment of\na special master to review all drunk driving cases of class\nmembers involving the convicted officer and determine whether\nthose convictions should be reversed. Id. at 51. The special\nmaster conducted an individualized review of these cases and\ndetermined that \"the only evidence inculpating the [defendants]\ncame from a police officer known to be corrupt.\" See Dickerson\nvs. Kane, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 92-2528 (D.N.J. July 17, 1995).\nThe District Court judge adopted the findings of the special\nmaster and ordered the reversal of 151 drunk driving\nconvictions. Id.\n     28\n       We leave to the single justice the question whether\ncertified mail or some other comparable means of delivery is\nappropriate to determine whether the defendant actually receives\nthe notice.\n\f                                                                   55\n\n\n    The new notice shall not only address the deficiencies\n\ndescribed in the content of the first written notice sent by the\n\ndistrict attorneys, but also simplify the process for defendants\n\nto move for a new trial.   The notice should identify the\n\ntelephone number of a \"hotline\" staffed by CPCS, so that persons\n\nwho receive the notice can seek immediate guidance.   The mailing\n\nshould permit a relevant Dookhan defendant to declare, simply by\n\nchecking a box, that the defendant wishes to discuss with\n\ncounsel whether the defendant should attempt to vacate his or\n\nher drug conviction by filing a motion for a new trial, and\n\nshould also include a form indigency affidavit for the defendant\n\nto fill out if he or she claims to be indigent and therefore\n\nqualifies for the assignment of counsel.   CPCS is encouraged to\n\ndraft and include within the mailing a separate letter providing\n\nthe legal guidance and information that CPCS would generally\n\nprovide to a relevant Dookhan defendant who would telephone its\n\nhotline.   Because this guidance letter, unlike the notice,\n\nconstitutes legal advocacy and not simply legal information, and\n\nmight encourage relevant Dookhan defendants to move for a new\n\ntrial to eliminate the collateral consequences arising from\n\ntheir drug conviction, the content of this letter shall not\n\nrequire the approval of the single justice.   Along with the\n\nnotice, the guidance letter, the check-off sheet, and the form\n\nindigency affidavit, the mailing shall include a stamped, self-\n\f                                                                    56\n\n\naddressed envelope so that, once completed, the documents may be\n\nreturned to an address designated by the single justice.    Where\n\na relevant Dookhan defendant returns the documents indicating\n\nthat he or she is indigent and wishes to explore with counsel\n\nthe filing of a motion for a new trial, the single justice shall\n\nmake an indigency determination and, where indigency is found,\n\nshall order CPCS to assign counsel to the defendant.   No action\n\nshall be taken regarding any relevant Dookhan defendant's\n\nconviction where he or she does not return the documents or\n\notherwise move for a new trial.\n\n    The single justice shall also address the challenge created\n\nby the substantial number of relevant Dookhan defendants who\n\nhave yet to be successfully located.   As it stands now, these\n\ndefendants have yet to be informed that the substance at issue\n\nin their case was tested by Dookhan in the Hinton lab, that\n\nDookhan's misconduct over many years has been found to be\n\negregious government misconduct, and that they are entitled to\n\nthe conclusive presumption of egregious government misconduct if\n\nthey were to move for a new trial.   Because they have not yet\n\nbeen so informed, they effectively have been denied the\n\nopportunity to seek redress for this misconduct.\n\n    The district attorneys have an obligation to take all\n\nreasonable steps necessary to provide these individuals with\n\nnotice of Dookhan's misconduct, and that includes reasonable\n\f                                                                   57\n\n\nefforts to locate them, wherever they might be residing.     Where,\n\ndespite reasonable efforts, the district attorneys are unable to\n\nobtain an address for a relevant Dookhan defendant, or where the\n\nnotice is returned as undeliverable, the single justice shall\n\ndirect the relevant district attorney to locate the current\n\naddress of the defendant's last attorney of record in the case.\n\nThe notice and accompanying documents shall be sent to that\n\nattorney, with a cover letter asking the attorney to make best\n\nefforts to locate his or her former client so that effective\n\nnotice can be accomplished.   In addition, the single justice\n\nshall have the authority to direct the probation department to\n\ninclude a notation in the missing defendant's board of probation\n\nrecord indicating that the defendant is a relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendant, so that the defendant can receive the required notice\n\nand related documents if he or she returns to court.   For the\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants who cannot otherwise be located, the\n\nsingle justice shall also have the authority to order the use of\n\nsocial or other media to provide the notice and related\n\ndocuments, or information regarding them.\n\n    The financial burden of notifying defendants of egregious\n\ngovernment misconduct that affected their criminal cases must be\n\nborne by the prosecuting district attorney's office, even if, as\n\nhere, the fault belongs to the Hinton lab and Dookhan, not the\n\nprosecutors.   Therefore, the cost of providing new and adequate\n\f                                                                    58\n\n\nnotice, including but not limited to the cost of mailing, of\n\nlocating missing defendants, and of publicity through social and\n\nother media, shall be borne by the district attorneys, with the\n\nallocation of those costs to be determined by the single\n\njustice.   We recognize that this cost could be considerable, but\n\nthat is a consequence of egregious government misconduct that\n\naffected more than 20,000 defendants.   We also note that a\n\ndistrict attorney may reduce the amount of this cost by reducing\n\nthe number of defendants identified in the third letter.      The\n\nfailure of a district attorney to bear the district's\n\nproportionate share of these costs shall be deemed equivalent to\n\na failure to provide defendants with exculpatory information,\n\nwith the sanctions appropriate to such a failure.\n\n    iii.   Phase three.   In the third phase, CPCS shall identify\n\nin writing to the single justice all cases, if any, where CPCS\n\nreceived an order for the assignment of counsel, but was unable\n\nwithin sixty days of the order to assign counsel despite CPCS's\n\nbest efforts.   The single justice shall then make a factual\n\nfinding, after hearing, whether CPCS has made best efforts to\n\nassign counsel in these cases.   In those cases where the single\n\njustice makes such a finding, the single justice shall issue an\n\norder to show cause why the drug conviction of this\n\nunrepresented defendant should not be vacated, and set a date\n\nfor a show cause hearing where the Commonwealth will have an\n\f                                                                  59\n\n\nopportunity to be heard.   At or after that hearing, if the\n\nsingle justice determines that relevant Dookhan defendants have\n\nbeen denied their right to counsel because of the inability of\n\nCPCS, despite its best efforts, to assign counsel to represent\n\nthe defendants, the single justice may order that the drug\n\nconvictions at issue be vacated and dismissed without prejudice,\n\nunless the interests of justice otherwise dictate.29   See\n\nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 246.\n\n     Conclusion.   The case is remanded to the single justice for\n\nthe entry of a declaratory judgment as provided in this opinion\n\nand for further action consistent with this opinion.30\n\n                                    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     29\n       We recognize our authority to appoint a special master to\nassist the single justice in his or her exercise of our\nsuperintendence authority in these cases. See S.J.C. Rule 2:13,\nas appearing in 382 Mass. 749 (1981).\n     30\n       Because we recognize the challenges involved in\nimplementing the three-phase protocol, the single justice is\nauthorized to make necessary revisions if any part of it is\ndetermined to be impracticable. In addition, if this protocol\nfor any reason were to prove inadequate in practice to remedy\nthe wrong despite the best efforts of the parties, the single\njustice may issue a new reservation and report to the full\ncourt.\n\f     LENK, J. (concurring, with whom Budd, J., joins).     It has\n\nbeen over five years since the stunning misconduct of a rogue\n\nchemist at the State's William A. Hinton State Laboratory\n\nInstitute (Hinton lab) first came to light.   The nature, scope,\n\nand adverse consequences of that misconduct on the individuals\n\ndirectly affected, on our system of justice, and on the\n\ntaxpayers who must foot the bill for this lamentable turn of\n\nevents are all ably recounted in the court's opinion, as well as\n\nin the dissenting opinion.   I write separately to underscore\n\nthat, in those five years, and despite the time and efforts of so\n\nmany, we have managed to address fewer than 2,000 of the\n\nestimated 20,000 or more cases involving Annie Dookhan-tainted\n\nevidence.   We cannot go on this way.\n\n     Even as we speak, the myriad ripple effects of one woman's\n\nmisdeeds continue to afflict the relevant Dookhan defendants,\n\nthousands and thousands of whom already have served their time\n\nfor convictions that we now know to be suspect.   As a result of\n\nhaving a prior drug conviction, many of those same people, some\n\nof whom may not even know to this day of Dookhan's fateful role\n\nin their lives, may now find themselves unable to get work or\n\nhousing, obtain or keep needed professional and drivers'\n\nlicenses, attend college, receive government benefits, or even\n\nstay in this country.   Mindful of this, I share the dissenting\n\nJustice's frustration with the unacceptably glacial systemic\n\f                                                                   2\n\n\nresponse to date and join in her view that extraordinary measures\n\nare now in order.   For reasons explained in the court's opinion,\n\nhowever, I regard the protocol announced today (Bridgeman II\n\nprotocol) as promising to be such a measure, but only if\n\nimplemented in a manner that countenances no further delays.    For\n\nthe protocol to achieve its goals and end this \"blight on the\n\nintegrity of our criminal justice system,\" post at   , there must\n\nbe strict compliance with its stringent timelines and\n\nrequirements.   Only this will forestall the need for a\n\n\"Bridgeman III\" and different measures.\n\n     While blame for the difficult situation in which we find\n\nourselves lies solely with Dookhan and the Hinton lab that\n\nallowed it to happen -- and it cannot be said too many times that\n\nfault most certainly does not lie with the prosecutors who,\n\nwithout knowing its tainted provenance, in good faith used the\n\nevidence Dookhan created -- we consistently have recognized that\n\nher misdeeds must be attributed to the government, and that the\n\ngovernment must bear the responsibility to put things right.\n\nJust as the success of the Bridgeman II protocol will depend on\n\nits timely and rigorous implementation, so too will its viability\n\nturn, at least initially, on the willingness of the district\n\nattorneys promptly to dismiss with prejudice a truly significant\n\nnumber of the roughly 20,000 relevant Dookhan defendants'\n\ncases -- at a minimum, those for simple possession in which\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nsentences already have been served.     See ante at note 24.   Not\n\ndoing so in the first phase of the protocol will of necessity add\n\nto the already staggering human and financial costs of the\n\nscandal and risk overloading the already strained public defense\n\nsystem.   In this regard, we cannot turn a blind eye to the\n\npotential costs of the looming crisis of thus far undetermined\n\nmagnitude caused in western Massachusetts by Sonja Farak, yet\n\nanother rogue chemist employed by a State laboratory.    And, as to\n\nthe presumably limited number of remaining cases that the\n\ndistrict attorneys decline to dismiss, truly informative notice\n\nto the defendants involved, using whatever modes of communication\n\nwill be effective, is vital to achieving the fair and workable\n\noutcome contemplated by the protocol.\n\n     Recognizing what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once called\n\n\"the fierce urgency of now,\" we must act swiftly and surely to\n\nstaunch the damage and to make things as right as we can.      The\n\nBridgeman II protocol draws upon the deep roots of our\n\njurisprudence to craft a response that, consistent with\n\nfundamental principles, will bring this deplorable episode\n\nforthwith to a just resolution once and for all.     May it be so.\n\f     HINES, J. (dissenting).   The petitioners and intervener\n\n(collectively, petitioners) are before this court once again\n\nseeking a global remedy for the more than 20,000 defendants\n\nwhose convictions were tainted by Annie Dookhan’s unprecedented1\n\nand far-reaching misconduct at the William A. Hinton State\n\nLaboratory Institute.    The court rejects a global remedy,\n\nadopting the view that \"despite its considerable risks and\n\nburdens, case-by-case adjudication is the fairest and best\n\nalternative to resolve the cases potentially tainted by\n\nDookhan's misconduct.\"    Ante at    .   I disagree.   Now, more\n\nthan five years after Dookhan's misconduct first came to light,\n\nthe need to adopt a swift and sure remedy for the harm caused by\n\nher deceit presents itself with palpable urgency.      The time has\n\ncome to close the book on this scandal, once and for all, by\n\nadopting a global remedy.    While I agree, as the court notes,\n\nthat a global remedy is \"strong medicine,\" ante at        , the\n\ncontinuing violation of the rights of the defendants affected by\n\nDookhan's misconduct and the damage to the integrity of our\n\ncriminal justice system demand no less.\n\n     Contrary to the court's assessment of the case-by-case\n\nprocedure offered as the solution to the problem the court is\n\nobliged to solve, it is neither the fairest nor the best\n\n     1\n       An exhaustive search of reported cases yielded not a\nsingle case involving misconduct comparable to that committed by\nDookhan.\n\f                                                                     2\n\n\nalternative for remedying the manifest injustice to the\n\ndefendants caught up in the Dookhan scandal and for restoring\n\nthe integrity to our criminal justice system.    It fails as the\n\n\"fairest\" alternative because it flouts the guiding principle\n\nthat \"in the wake of government misconduct that has cast a\n\nshadow over the entire criminal justice system, it is most\n\nappropriate that the benefit of the remedy inure to the\n\ndefendants.\"    Commonwealth v. Scott, 467 Mass. 336, 352 (2014),\n\nciting Lavallee v. Justices in the Hampden Superior Court, 442\n\nMass. 228, 246 (2004).    It also fails as the \"best\" alternative\n\nbecause it is simply unworkable as a timely and effective\n\nmechanism for addressing the due process claims of the thousands\n\nof defendants now deemed to have been convicted on Dookhan's\n\ntainted evidence.     In short, the court's solution is too little\n\nand too late.    The only fitting end to this blight on the\n\nintegrity of our criminal justice system is vacatur and\n\ndismissal with prejudice of the convictions of all relevant\n\nDookhan defendants.    Therefore, I dissent.\n\n     The case for a global remedy.      We have been here before.\n\nWe acknowledged in Scott, 467 Mass. at 352, that Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct caused \"a lapse of systemic magnitude in the criminal\n\njustice system.\"    Recognizing the \"particularly insidious\"\n\nnature of Dookhan's misconduct and that it \"belies\n\nreconstruction,\" we adopted a conclusive presumption of\n\f                                                                         3\n\n\negregious government misconduct as an accommodation to those\n\ndefendants able to establish Dookhan's role in producing the\n\nevidence upon which their conviction was based.         Id.   Later in\n\nBridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 471 Mass.\n\n465 (2015) (Bridgeman I), we declined the invitation to\n\nimplement a global remedy for the thousands of cases affected by\n\nDookhan's misconduct \"at this time.\"      Id. at 487.    Signaling a\n\npreference for a measured approach rather than the more drastic\n\nglobal remedy advocated by the petitioners, we noted that \"our\n\ndecisions in Scott and [Commonwealth v. Charles, 466 Mass. 63\n\n(2013)], have provided Dookhan defendants . . . with meaningful\n\nsolutions for addressing concerns that have arisen as these\n\ndefendants attempt to challenge their drug convictions.\"          Id.\n\n     Since Bridgeman I, however, Scott's promise as a hedge\n\nagainst the wholesale violation of the due process rights of\n\nthis class of defendants has been undermined by the sheer\n\nmagnitude of the problem.      Scott was decided without the benefit\n\nof the investigative reports establishing the scope of Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct.2    The court reasonably assumed, therefore, that the\n\njurisprudential shortcut to proving Dookhan's misconduct would\n\nmake a case-by-case approach workable.     Because we now know the\n\nextent of Dookhan's misconduct and that it has not yet been\n\nmitigated in any significant respect by the measures in Scott\n\n     2\n         See ante at note 6.\n\f                                                                      4\n\n\nand Charles, that assumption is no longer valid.   With a clearer\n\neye on the scope of the problem, Scott's characterization of\n\nDookhan's misconduct as a \"lapse of systemic magnitude\" still\n\nstands as an apt factual and legal context for the petitioners'\n\nclaims.   Scott, 467 Mass. at 352.\n\n     In this case, as in Scott, we are called upon to \"exercise\n\nour superintendence power [under G. L. c. 211, § 3,] to fashion\n\na workable approach to motions to withdraw a guilty plea brought\n\nby defendants affected by [Dookhan's] misconduct.\"   Id.    In this\n\nundertaking, the appropriate analytical framework is that\n\narticulated in Scott.3   We noted that in fashioning a remedy for\n\nthe \"systemic lapse\" caused by Dookhan's misconduct, \"[w]e must\n\naccount for the due process rights of defendants, the integrity\n\nof the criminal justice system, the efficient administration of\n\njustice in responding to such potentially broad-ranging\n\nmisconduct, and the myriad public interests at stake.\"     Id.   In\n\n\n     3\n       Without clearly explaining why, the court strays from the\nanalytical framework we adopted in Scott, relying instead on a\nself-selected set of \"principles\" explained in elaborate detail.\nAnte at    . I agree that these principles are firmly rooted in\nour jurisprudence, but they are not necessarily dispositive of\nthe issue presented here. Absent a reason to play by a\ndifferent set of rules from that articulated in Scott, 467 Mass.\nat 352, and reiterated in Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 487, as an\nappropriate standard to apply in \"fashion[ing] a workable\napproach\" to handling the cases in which Dookhan was the primary\nor confirmatory chemist, I would not spurn the analytical\napproach adopted in Scott. The problem here is the same as it\nwas in Scott: the need to craft a fair and timely approach to\nthe resolution of these cases.\n\f                                                                        5\n\n\nbalancing these factors as discussed below, I am persuaded that\n\nthe case for a global remedy as advocated by the petitioners is\n\ncompelling.\n\n       1.    Due process rights.   The due process rights at stake\n\nhere, \"the opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in\n\na meaningful manner'\" (citation omitted), Bridgeman I, 471 Mass.\n\nat 479, weigh heavily in Scott's remedial calculus for two\n\nreasons:       the serious and ongoing collateral consequences to the\n\nclass of defendants convicted on the strength of Dookhan's\n\ntainted evidence; and the necessity to avoid unnecessary delay\n\nbeyond the four years that already have elapsed in providing\n\nthese defendants a \"meaningful\" opportunity to establish\n\nprejudice from Dookhan's misconduct.       The court, ante at, paints\n\na grim picture of how lives are upended by the serious\n\ncollateral consequences of drug-related convictions.       The\n\npicture is even more grim when one considers that many, if not\n\nmost, of these defendants have already served their sentences.4\n\nThey have paid their debt to society whether they owed one or\n\nnot.       The years spent incarcerated cannot be restored to these\n\n       4\n       An analysis conducted by a data science fellow at the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts found\nthat approximately sixty-two per cent of the convictions in the\ncases tainted by Dookhan's misconduct were for possession only\nand that about ninety-one per cent of these cases were resolved\nin the District Court. These statistics support the assumption\nthat most defendants have completed their sentences.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\ndefendants, but a fair and just resolution can make amends.\n\nWhat due process requires then is a remedy that is simple, sure,\n\nand final.   That means a remedy that is uncomplicated by the\n\nmyriad moving parts built into the court's case-by-case model,\n\nfree of the risk that further delay will prolong the only relief\n\nthat realistically can be offered to defendants who have already\n\nserved their sentences.   This interpretation of what due process\n\nrequires at this point in the effort to solve the Dookhan\n\nproblem is supported by Scott and Bridgeman I.\n\n     In Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 479, the court declined to\n\nadopt a global remedy in part based on the \"substantial efforts\n\nthat are being made to deal with the impact of Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct.\"    With at least the prospect of a speedy resolution\n\nof the cases in which Dookhan was the primary or confirmatory\n\nchemist, the court was content to delay a more robust remedy to\n\nallow those efforts to accomplish their purpose.5   Id. at 487.\n\nHere, however, we have come to an end point in assessing the\n\nimpact of Scott and Charles in resolving the outstanding cases\n\nof this type.   The district attorneys have identified 24,000\n\ncases, more or less, that must be adjudicated on the prejudice\n\nprong of Scott.   Thus, the scope of the current challenge is\n\n\n     5\n       The court observed that \"[o]ur decision . . . will go a\nlong way in resolving additional concerns that have surfaced and\nin moving these cases forward towards resolution.\" Bridgeman I,\n471 Mass. at 487.\n\f                                                                     7\n\n\nclear.    The remedy, in accounting for defendants' due process\n\nright to a prompt hearing, must have some reasonable prospect\n\nfor immediate resolution of the 24,000 cases to avoid\n\nexacerbating the serious consequences of delay.    I am not\n\npersuaded that the court's case-by-case model meets this test in\n\ncircumstances where the defendants' due process rights are\n\nparamount.\n\n     2.   Integrity of the criminal justice system.   It is beyond\n\ndispute that Dookhan's misconduct, the details of which have\n\nspread beyond the legal community,6 has undermined public trust\n\nin the integrity of the criminal justice system.    In a case such\n\nas this, coming before the court as a consequence of Dookhan's\n\nserious corruption of our criminal justice system, the court's\n\ntask is not merely to decide the rights of the parties.       The\n\ncourt must also act, within the boundaries of the law, to\n\nrestore the public's faith in the integrity of the courts.\n\nUnlike the right to counsel crisis in Lavallee, Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct is not a problem of the Legislature's making.      See\n\nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 246.   The duty to protect, and restore\n\nwhen necessary, the integrity of the criminal justice system\n\nfalls squarely upon the court.\n\n     With no clear sign from the court that it grasps the scope\n\n     6\n       See, e.g., Jackman, When a State's Drug Chemist Lies for\nYears, Should All Her Cases Be Thrown Out?, Wash. Post, Sept.\n29, 2016.\n\f                                                                    8\n\n\nof the damage and the need for an approach that will eliminate\n\n\"root and branch\"7 all of the attendant consequences, the public\n\nis left to wonder if the process by which a court imposes the\n\nsanction of a loss of liberty is fair and just.8   Restoring the\n\nintegrity of the criminal justice system requires that the court\n\nacknowledge and make amends for the shortcomings in a system\n\nthat permitted Dookhan to \"go rogue\" for so long without\n\ndetection.9   Those shortcomings call into question the integrity\n\nof the entire criminal justice apparatus for gathering and\n\nreporting the evidence that juries rely on in deciding a\n\ndefendant's guilt or innocence.   The perceived legitimacy of\n\ncourt-imposed restraints on a defendant's liberty rises or falls\n\non the integrity of the evidence.   If the mistrust engendered by\n\nthe individual and institutional failures that produced this\n\nscandal is allowed to remain, it will have far-reaching adverse\n\n\n     7\n       See Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 437-438\n(1968)(using phrase to describe obligation to dismantle school\nsegregation fourteen years after command to do so in Brown v.\nBoard of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 [1954]).\n     8\n       Over the years, the racial impact of our sentencing\npractices have come under scrutiny. See e.g., The Sentencing\nProject, The Color of Justice: Racial and Ethnic Disparity in\nState Prisons, at 3, 5, 7-8 & n.13, 16-18 (2016). Although\nracial bias has not been documented, members of the public,\nespecially those in the communities of color, rarely parse such\nreports in search of the real reason for disparate impact.\n     9\n       \"Dookhan's consistently high testing volumes should have\nbeen a clear indication that a more thorough analysis and review\nof her work was needed.\" See Scott, 467 Mass. at 340.\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nconsequences for the ability of our courts to maintain the\n\npublic's faith in the promise of equal justice for all.   Because\n\nI am not persuaded that the case-by-case model adopted by the\n\ncourt can accomplish this essential purpose, this factor weighs\n\nin favor of the global remedy advocated by the petitioners.\n\n    3.   Efficient administration of justice.   There is no\n\nquestion that, despite the best efforts of the parties,\n\nthousands of defendants affected by Dookhan's misconduct still\n\nlanguish without notice of their rights or even a realistic\n\nopportunity for redress.   The four-year delay in the resolution\n\nof the cases tainted by Dookhan's misconduct, as discussed\n\nabove, adequately makes the point that the administration of\n\njustice has been anything but efficient.   Yet, the court gives\n\ninsufficient weight to this factor in adopting a case-by-case\n\nadjudication model.\n\n    The efficacy of the court's case-by-case model is at best\n\nquestionable, both because it is unworkable and because it is\n\nlikely to perpetuate further delay in providing a remedy to the\n\nthousands of defendants affected by Dookhan's misconduct.     Not\n\nonly is it lacking in the ability to insure a speedy resolution\n\nof the 24,000 cases thus tainted, it is vulnerable to failure\n\nfor several practical reasons:   the reliance on voluntary\n\ncooperation of the district attorneys, and unrealistic\n\ntimetables.\n\f                                                                       10\n\n\n    First, the success of phase one, which anticipates a\n\nsubstantial culling of the 24,000 cases, depends entirely on the\n\nvoluntary cooperation of the district attorneys.     Ante at       .\n\nUnderstandably, the court has not asserted any authority to\n\ncompel the dismissal of cases.    See Commonwealth v. Pellegrini,\n\n414 Mass. 402, 405 (1993) (\"Prosecutors have broad discretion in\n\ndetermining whether to prosecute a case\").     In this respect, the\n\ncourt's model does not change the status quo:    the district\n\nattorneys already have, and have had for the duration of the\n\nDookhan crisis, the sole authority voluntarily to dismiss these\n\ncases.   It is undisputed that the district attorneys have\n\ncooperated in identifying the defendants presumed to have been\n\naffected by Dookhan's misconduct.    However, without some basis\n\nfor a reasonable belief that the district attorneys will follow\n\nthrough on the suggestion to dismiss thousands of cases with\n\nprejudice, the court does not inspire confidence in the success\n\nof the model.\n\n    Second, the timetable for the accomplishment of the various\n\nphases of the case-by-case model is unrealistic and\n\nunachievable.   The court acknowledges that \"substantial vetting\"\n\nis required under phase one.     Ante at   .   Yet, the district\n\nattorneys are given only ninety days to sift through the 24,000\n\ncases that have been connected to Dookhan's misconduct.    If past\n\nis prologue, and taking into account the delays in getting to\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\nwhere we are now, accomplishing this task within the ninety-day\n\nwindow adopted for the court's model is highly unlikely.\n\nLikewise, the thirty-day deadline in phase two for notice to the\n\ndefendants whose cases will not be dismissed without prejudice\n\nis problematic for the same reason.    To the extent that the time\n\nframes reflect a calculation that absolute compliance by the\n\ndistrict attorneys and the Committee for Public Counsel Services\n\nwill adequately accommodate the defendants' due process rights,\n\nI have no confidence that the court's faith in the practicality\n\nof the process will be rewarded.   Unless the court is prepared\n\nto declare that reasonable requests for delay, even those based\n\non the impracticality of the timetable, will be denied, the more\n\nlikely scenario is that further indeterminable delay will occur.\n\n    With the defendants' due process right to a prompt hearing\n\nhanging in the balance, I cannot accept an untimely, and\n\nultimately unworkable, case-by-case model as an appropriate\n\nresolution of the issue before us.\n\n    4.   Other public interests.     None of the other public\n\ninterests at stake here warrants a disposition that prolongs a\n\nglobal remedy for the defendants who are presumed to have been\n\nvictims of Dookhan's misconduct.   First, the likelihood that the\n\nvast majority of the defendants in the cases in which Dookhan\n\nwas the primary or confirmatory chemist have completed their\n\nsentences mitigates the most compelling public interest at stake\n\f                                                                    12\n\n\nhere:   public safety.   On the other side of the ledger, the\n\nserious and enduring collateral consequences of these\n\nconvictions remain extant, resulting in manifest injustice to\n\nthose defendants.   The court weighs the rights of the defendants\n\n\"against the necessity for preserving society's interest in the\n\nadministration of justice\" and concludes that this factor favors\n\nthe Commonwealth.   Ante at      , quoting Commonwealth v. Cronk,\n\n396 Mass. 194, 198-199 (1985).    In my view, this calculation is\n\ndemonstrably erroneous.    Society's interest in the\n\nadministration of justice is hardly served by a remedy that\n\ndefers to the Commonwealth in deciding which, if any, cases are\n\nto be dismissed with prejudice and, in all other respects,\n\ndepends on the defendants to opt into the scheme to benefit from\n\nthe possibility that the case will be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nAnte at.\n\n    In sum, the Scott factors weigh heavily in favor of the\n\ndefendants in the cases tainted by Dookhan's misconduct.     The\n\nscope and egregiousness of that misconduct, combined with the\n\nfour-year delay in providing relief to the defendants affected\n\nby it, compels a global remedy.    It is difficult to imagine a\n\nscenario where, faced with the detritus from a scandal of\n\nsimilar magnitude, a court would hesitate to order a global\n\f                                                              13\n\n\nremedy.

We once again confront the tragic legacy of\n\nthe misconduct of Annie Dookhan when she was employed as a\n\nchemist at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory Institute\n\n(Hinton lab).

District Attorney for the Suffolk\n\nDist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (2015) (Bridgeman I), the petitioners\n\nand the intervener, the Committee for Public Counsel Services\n\n(CPCS), asked that we exercise our broad powers of\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nsuperintendence to vacate the thousands of drug convictions\n\naffected by Dookhan's misconduct because the time and expense of\n\ncase-by-case adjudication had become \"untenable.\"    We declined\n\nat that time to adopt their proposed \"global remedy.\"     However,\n\nthe district attorneys have now provided the single justice with\n\nlists identifying more than 20,000 defendants who could be\n\neligible for relief based on Dookhan's misconduct but who have\n\nnot yet sought relief from their drug convictions.     As a result\n\nof the number of potentially aggrieved defendants, the single\n\njustice issued a reservation and report to the full court that\n\nessentially invites us to reconsider whether the time has come\n\nfor a global remedy or whether further steps must be taken to\n\nrealistically implement the remedy of case-by-case adjudication\n\nof potentially thousands of motions for a new trial.\n\n     After such reconsideration, we decline to adopt the\n\ndistrict attorneys' argument that we should stay the course we\n\nhad previously set and take no further action to protect the\n\nrights of the \"relevant Dookhan defendants.\"3   We also decline to\n\nadopt the petitioners' request for a global remedy in which we\n\nwould either vacate the convictions of all relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants with prejudice, and thereby bar any reprosecution, or\n\nvacate the convictions without prejudice, and allow the\n\n\n     3\n       See note 8 and accompanying text, infra, for the\ndefinition of the term \"relevant Dookhan defendants.\"\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nCommonwealth one year to reprosecute, dismissing with prejudice\n\nall cases not reprosecuted within that time period.\n\n       We instead adopt a new protocol for case-by-case\n\nadjudication, which will occur in three phases, and order its\n\nimplementation by the single justice in the form of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment.    In the first phase, the district\n\nattorneys shall exercise their prosecutorial discretion and\n\nreduce the number of relevant Dookhan defendants by moving to\n\nvacate and dismiss with prejudice all drug cases the district\n\nattorneys would not or could not reprosecute if a new trial were\n\nordered.    In the second phase, new, adequate notice shall be\n\napproved by the single justice and provided to all relevant\n\nDookhan defendants whose cases have not been dismissed in phase\n\none.    In the third phase, CPCS shall assign counsel to all\n\nindigent relevant Dookhan defendants who wish to explore the\n\npossibility of moving to vacate their plea or for a new trial.\n\nIf the number seeking counsel is so large that counsel cannot be\n\nassigned despite CPCS's best efforts, the single justice will\n\nfashion an appropriate remedy under our general superintendence\n\nauthority for the constitutional violation, which may include\n\ndismissing without prejudice the relevant drug convictions in\n\ncases where an indigent defendant is deprived of the right to\n\ncounsel.\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\n     We recognize that the implementation of this protocol will\n\nsubstantially burden the district attorneys, CPCS, and the\n\ncourts.   But we also recognize that Dookhan's misconduct at the\n\nHinton lab has substantially burdened the due process rights of\n\nmany thousands of defendants whose convictions rested on her\n\ntainted drug analysis and who, even if they have served their\n\nsentences, continue to suffer the collateral consequences\n\narising from those convictions.   And we recognize as well that,\n\nmore than four years after Dookhan's misconduct was revealed,\n\nmore than 20,000 defendants who are entitled to a conclusive\n\npresumption that egregious government misconduct occurred in\n\ntheir case have yet to receive adequate notice that they may\n\nhave been victimized by Dookhan's misconduct, that they may file\n\na motion to vacate their drug conviction, and that they have a\n\nright to counsel to assist them in the preparation of such a\n\nmotion.   The remedy we order, challenging as it is to implement,\n\npreserves the ability of these defendants to vindicate their\n\nrights through case-by-case adjudication, respects the exercise\n\nof prosecutorial discretion, and maintains the fairness and\n\nintegrity of our criminal justice system in the wake of a\n\nlaboratory scandal of unprecedented magnitude.4\n\n\n     4\n       We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the National\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Massachusetts\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers; the Boston Bar\nAssociation; the National Association for Public Defense; and\n\f                                                                         6\n\n\n       Background.     Dookhan began her employment in November,\n\n2003, as a chemist at the Hinton lab, a forensic drug laboratory\n\nthat was overseen by the Department of Public Health\n\n(department).    See Commonwealth v.

The department concluded that \"Dookhan failed\n\nto follow [Hinton lab] protocols for the transfer and\n\ndocumentation of samples for testing, and subsequently created a\n\nfalse record of said transfers.\"       Id.    Dookhan was placed on\n\npaid administrative leave and then resigned from her position,\n\neffective March 9, 2012.       Id.\n\n       In July, 2012, the Legislature transferred oversight of the\n\nHinton lab to the State police.      See St. 2012, c. 139, § 56\n\n(replacing G. L. c. 22C, § 39); St. 2012, c. 139, § 107\n\n(repealing G. L. c. 111, §§ 12-13).

In August, 2012, the State police initiated a more\n\nextensive investigation of the Hinton lab, which \"revealed\n\nnumerous improprieties surrounding Dookhan's conduct in the\n\nlab.\"    Id. at 339.    See Charles, 466 Mass. at 64.      Based in part\n\n\n\nthe New England Innocence Project and the North Carolina Center\non Actual Innocence.\n\f                                                                 7\n\n\non Dookhan's confession of misconduct on August 28, 2012, the\n\nState police investigation revealed, among other misconduct, the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     Dookhan \"admitted to 'dry labbing' for two to three years\n      prior to her transfer out of the [Hinton] lab in 2011,\n      meaning that she would group multiple samples together from\n      various cases that looked alike, then test only a few\n      samples, but report the results as if she had tested each\n      sample individually.\" Scott, supra.\n     She admitted to \"contaminating samples intentionally,\n      including turning negative samples into positive samples on\n      at least a few occasions.\" Id.\n     She admitted that she removed samples from the evidence\n      locker in breach of Hinton lab protocols, postdated entries\n      in the evidence log book, and forged an evidence officer's\n      initials. Id.\n     She falsified reports intended to verify that the gas\n      chromatography-mass spectrometer machine used in\n      \"confirmatory\"5 drug testing was functioning properly before\n      she ran samples through the machine. Id. at 339-340.\n     The potential scope of Dookhan's misconduct encompassed\n      testing samples in over 40,000 cases. Id. at 340. This\n      number is so large because Dookhan \"reported test results\n\n\n\n\n      5\n       \"Confirmatory\" testing is often referred to in our\nopinions as \"secondary\" testing. We use the terms\ninterchangeably.\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\n    on samples at rates consistently much higher than any other\n    chemist in the [Hinton] lab.\" Id.6\n\n    A grand jury indicted Dookhan on seventeen counts of\n\ntampering with evidence, eight counts of obstruction of justice,\n\none count of perjury, and one count of falsely claiming to hold\n\na graduate degree.   Dookhan pleaded guilty to all of the\n\nindictments on November 22, 2013, and she was sentenced to from\n\nthree years to five years in State prison, followed by a\n\nprobationary term of two years.   Scott, 467 Mass. at 337 & n.3.\n\nThe revelations regarding Dookhan's misconduct triggered the\n\nfiling of hundreds of motions for a new trial and for a stay of\n\nexecution of sentence in cases where the defendant was convicted\n\n    6\n       In addition to the State police investigation, the\nGovernor requested a top-to-bottom review of the William A.\nHinton State Laboratory Institute (Hinton lab) to determine\nwhether any other employees at the Hinton lab committed\nmalfeasance. The office of the Inspector General (OIG)\nconducted a fifteen-month investigation of the Hinton lab that\nincluded interviews with more than forty individuals and an\nexamination of more than 200,000 documents. The OIG concluded\nthat \"Dookhan was the sole bad actor at the [Hinton lab]\" and\nthat no other chemist at the laboratory knowingly aided her\nmisconduct. But the OIG report described massive deficiencies\nby the Department of Public Health (department) in its oversight\nand management of the Hinton lab. These deficiencies included a\nlack of accreditation and inadequate chemist training; distant\nor uninterested supervisors; inconsistent testing practices;\ndeviation from chain-of-custody guidelines; and faulty security.\nThis environment \"gave Dookhan the freedom to start making and\nfollowing her own rules.\" Even when coworkers began raising red\nflags about Dookhan, directors at the Hinton lab were\n\"habitually unresponsive\" and \"severely downplayed Dookhan's\nmajor breach in chain-of-custody protocol.\" The OIG report\nconcluded that \"all samples in which Dookhan was the primary\nchemist should be treated as suspect and be subject to careful\nreview.\"\n\f                                                                         9\n\n\nof a drug crime based on a drug analysis conducted by the Hinton\n\nlab.       Charles, 466 Mass. at 65-66.7   To address this onslaught of\n\nmotions, the Chief Justice of the Superior Court in October,\n\n2012, assigned specific judges in seven counties to preside over\n\nspecial \"drug lab\" sessions.       Id. at 65.   To assist these judges\n\nin the adjudication of these cases, the Chief Justice of the\n\nSuperior Court in November, 2012, exercised her authority under\n\nMass. R. Crim.

Id. at 66.\n\n       In Scott, 467 Mass. at 337-338, we considered the\n\nappropriate legal standard where a defendant, in response to\n\ngovernment misconduct in his or her case, moves to withdraw a\n\n\n       7\n       These motions were facilitated by a special task force\nestablished by the Governor in September, 2012. The task force,\nled by attorney David Meier, used data from the department to\nidentify individuals who could have been affected by Dookhan's\nmisconduct. The task force then shared the lists with\nprosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges, \"so as to enable\neach of the agencies and offices to respond appropriately.\" The\ntask force concentrated on identifying individuals most\nadversely affected, such as those in custody, awaiting trial, or\non probation or parole. By December, 2012, the task force\nidentified approximately 10,000 individuals who fell in these\npriority categories and who had to be notified immediately that\ntheir cases potentially were affected by Dookhan's misconduct.\nThe task force also produced a more comprehensive list of\napproximately 40,000 cases in which Dookhan served as a primary\nor confirmatory chemist. At the time the task force completed\nits final report, the criminal investigation of Dookhan and the\nOIG's review of the Hinton lab were still ongoing.\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nguilty plea or an admission to sufficient facts to warrant a\n\nfinding of guilty.   We adopted the two-pronged test in Ferrara\n\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202344\"><a href=\"/opinion/202344/ferrara-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290 (1st Cir. 2006), which\n\nrequires a defendant who seeks to vacate a guilty plea because\n\nof government misconduct to show \"both that 'egregiously\n\nimpermissible conduct . . . by government agents . . . antedated\n\nthe entry of his plea' and that 'the misconduct influenced his\n\ndecision to plead guilty or, put another way, that it was\n\nmaterial to that choice.'\"   Scott, supra at 346.\n\n    In considering whether the defendant had satisfied the\n\nfirst prong of this test, we concluded that, because Dookhan\n\n\"made a number of affirmative misrepresentations by signing\n\n[certificates of drug analysis (drug certificates)] and\n\ntestifying to the identity of substances in cases in which she\n\nhad not in fact properly tested the substances in question,\"\n\nDookhan's misconduct was \"egregious.\"   Id. at 348.   We also\n\nconcluded that, even though there was no indication that any\n\nprosecutor knew of her egregious misconduct, id. at 350 n.7, her\n\nmisconduct is \"attributable to the government\" for purposes of a\n\nmotion for a new trial, id. at 350 & n.7, because as a primary\n\nand secondary chemist she \"participated in the investigation or\n\nevaluation of the case\" and \"reported to the prosecutor's office\n\nconcerning the case.\"   Id. at 349, quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nMartin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 824 (1998).\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\n       We also recognized the dilemma that a defendant would face\n\nin attempting to prove that the laboratory analysis in his or\n\nher case was tainted by Dookhan's misconduct.      See Scott, 467\n\nMass. at 339, 351-352.    We noted that Dookhan acknowledged \"that\n\nshe may not be able to identify those cases in which she tested\n\nthe samples properly and those in which she did not.\"      Id. at\n\n339.    \"Thus, even if Dookhan herself were to testify in each of\n\nthe thousands of cases in which she served as primary or\n\nsecondary chemist, it is unlikely that her testimony, even if\n\ntruthful, could resolve the question whether she engaged in\n\nmisconduct in a particular case.\"    Id. at 352.   Because it was\n\n\"reasonably certain . . . that her misconduct touched a great\n\nnumber of cases,\" id., but \"may be impossible\" for any defendant\n\nto prove that the drug analysis in his or her case was tainted\n\nby her misconduct, id. at 351, we recognized that her\n\n\"particularly insidious form of misconduct, which belies\n\nreconstruction,\" resulted in \"a lapse of systemic magnitude in\n\nthe criminal justice system.\"    Id. at 352.\n\n       To resolve this dilemma, we exercised our power of \"general\n\nsuperintendence of all courts . . . to correct and prevent\n\nerrors and abuses\" under G. L. c. 211, § 3, and held that, where\n\nDookhan signed the drug certificate in a defendant's case as an\n\nassistant analyst, that is, as the primary or confirmatory\n\nchemist, see Scott, 467 Mass. at 353 n.9, a defendant who seeks\n\f                                                                       12\n\n\nto vacate his or her plea after learning of Dookhan's misconduct\n\n\"is entitled to a conclusive presumption that egregious\n\ngovernment misconduct occurred in [his or her] case.\"         Id. at\n\n352.   The consequence of the conclusive presumption of egregious\n\ngovernment misconduct is that a defendant can satisfy the first\n\nprong of the Ferrara test simply by showing that Dookhan signed\n\nthe drug certificate in his or her case as an assistant analyst.\n\nId. at 353.\n\n       We emphasized in Scott that the \"special evidentiary rule\"\n\nof a conclusive presumption is \"sui generis\" -- \"a remedy\n\ndictated by the particular circumstances surrounding Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct\" that was \"intended to apply only to this narrow\n\nclass of cases in which a defendant seeks to withdraw his or her\n\nguilty plea after having learned of Dookhan's misconduct.\"         Id.\n\nat 353-354.   We declared that \"it is most appropriate that the\n\nbenefit of our remedy inure to defendants\" where, as here, there\n\nis \"government misconduct that has cast a shadow over the entire\n\ncriminal justice system.\"    Id. at 352.    The remedy of a\n\nconclusive presumption, we concluded, takes into account \"the\n\ndue process rights of defendants, the integrity of the criminal\n\njustice system, the efficient administration of justice in\n\nresponding to such potentially broad-ranging misconduct, and the\n\nmyriad public interests at stake.\"    Id.\n\f                                                                   13\n\n\n       We did not relieve a defendant of the burden to satisfy the\n\nsecond prong of the Ferrara test by demonstrating that he or she\n\nsuffered prejudice by pleading guilty or admitting to sufficient\n\nfacts without having learned of Dookhan's misconduct, i.e., we\n\ndid not conclusively presume such prejudice.     Id. at 354-355,\n\n356.    The defendant, therefore, bears the burden of proving \"a\n\nreasonable probability that he [or she] would not have pleaded\n\nguilty had he [or she] known of Dookhan's misconduct,\" and\n\ninstead would have chosen to go to trial.    Id. at 355.   We noted\n\nthat, \"[u]nlike evidence of the particular scope of Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct, evidence of the circumstances surrounding the\n\ndefendant's decision to tender a guilty plea should be well\n\nwithin the defendant's reach.\"    Id. at 354 n.11.\n\n       In Commonwealth v. Francis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016), we\n\nreviewed the denial of a defendant's motion for a new trial\n\nwhere the defendant had been convicted at trial of drug charges\n\nafter drug certificates were admitted in evidence that were\n\nsigned by Dookhan as an assistant analyst.     We concluded that\n\nthe conclusive presumption of \"egregious government misconduct\"\n\nis not limited to motions to withdraw guilty pleas, but that,\n\nwhere the defendant has been convicted at trial, \"[t]he\n\nconsequence of the conclusive presumption is that we deem it\n\nerror to have admitted the drug certificates or comparable\n\nevidence regarding Dookhan's drug analysis where the defendant\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\nhad no knowledge of Dookhan's misconduct and therefore no\n\nopportunity to challenge the admissibility or credibility of\n\nthat evidence.\"   Id. at 817.\n\n    In Commonwealth v.

We refer to\n\nthese as the \"relevant Dookhan defendants.\"8\n\n     In Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 473-494, we considered two\n\nsets of issues raised by relevant Dookhan defendants who\n\npotentially were eligible for relief from their convictions\n\nbecause of Dookhan's misconduct, but who had not yet moved for\n\npostconviction relief.   The first set of issues identified\n\nconcerns that were discouraging these defendants from seeking\n\nthat relief.   The most significant was the risk that, if their\n\nmotion for a new trial were granted, the Commonwealth could\n\nreprosecute them not only on the charge to which the defendants\n\nhad pleaded guilty but also on any charge that was dismissed at\n\nthe time of the plea, and seek a more severe sentence,\n\nespecially where the dismissed charge carried a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence upon conviction.   Id. at 472-473.   Drawing\n\n\n     8\n       The term \"Dookhan defendants\" was defined in Bridgeman v.\nDistrict Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 n.4\n(2015) (Bridgeman I), \"to refer generally to those individuals\nwho were convicted of drug offenses and in whose cases Dookhan\nsigned the certificate of drug analysis (drug certificate) on\nthe line labeled 'Assistant Analyst.'\" Because Bridgeman I was\ndecided before Commonwealth v. Ruffin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016),\nthe term \"Dookhan defendants\" is broader than the term \"relevant\nDookhan defendants,\" because it includes those with cases in\nwhich Dookhan signed the drug certificate after their guilty\nplea or admission to sufficient facts to warrant a guilty\nfinding. In light of our decision in Ruffin, the set of\ndefendants entitled to the conclusive presumption of egregious\ngovernment misconduct is limited to the \"relevant Dookhan\ndefendants,\" and the relief we order infra is limited to this\nset of defendants.\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\nbroadly on the need to \"ameliorate [the] damaging effects\" of\n\nDookhan's misconduct, id. at 474, we held that \"a defendant who\n\nhas been granted a new trial based on Dookhan's misconduct at\n\nthe Hinton . . . lab cannot be charged with a more serious\n\noffense than that of which he or she initially was convicted\n\nunder the terms of a plea agreement and, if convicted again,\n\ncannot be given a more severe sentence than that which\n\noriginally was imposed.\"   Id. at 468.\n\n    The second set of issues in Bridgeman I concerned the\n\nfairness and practicability of attempting individually to\n\nresolve the multitude of motions for a new trial that\n\npotentially could be brought by the Dookhan defendants.    We\n\nallowed the motion to intervene filed by CPCS under Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 24 (a), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), recognizing that \"[i]t has\n\na substantial and immediate interest in these proceedings given\n\nits current and future responsibility for providing\n\nrepresentation to thousands of indigent Dookhan defendants who\n\nwant to pursue postconviction relief from their drug\n\nconvictions.\"   Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 485-486.    We then\n\naddressed CPCS's contention that, because so many cases were\n\naffected by Dookhan's misconduct, the \"time and expense of\n\nproceeding on a case-by-case basis has become untenable,\" and we\n\ntherefore should implement a \"global remedy\" to resolve these\n\ncases pursuant to our broad powers of superintendence under\n\f                                                                      17\n\n\nG. L. c. 211, § 3.      Bridgeman I, supra at 487.     Under the global\n\nremedy that CPCS proposed, we would vacate the convictions of\n\nall Dookhan defendants.      Id.    CPCS offered two alternatives:   we\n\ncould vacate the convictions with prejudice, and thereby bar any\n\nreprosecution; or we could vacate the convictions without\n\nprejudice, and allow the Commonwealth one year to reprosecute,\n\ndismissing with prejudice all cases not reprosecuted within that\n\ntime period.    Id.\n\n    We declined in Bridgeman I to implement a global remedy \"at\n\nthis time.\"    Id.    We noted that \"while '[i]t certainly is true\n\nthat we cannot expect defendants to bear the burden of a\n\nsystemic lapse, . . . we also cannot allow the misconduct of one\n\nperson to dictate an abrupt retreat from the fundamentals of our\n\ncriminal justice system.'\"         Id., quoting Scott, 467 Mass. at 354\n\nn.11.    We also noted that we had already provided \"meaningful\n\nsolutions\" to resolve these cases in Scott and Charles, and\n\nthat, in Bridgeman I, we were removing the barriers that made\n\ndefendants reluctant to file motions to withdraw their guilty\n\npleas.    Id. at 480, 487.   And we noted that some district\n\nattorneys had made progress in providing CPCS with the docket\n\nnumbers of the cases in which Dookhan was the primary or\n\nconfirmatory chemist, and encouraged the remaining district\n\nattorneys with such cases to assist the single justice in\n\f                                                                     18\n\n\nobtaining docket numbers for their districts.9    Id. at 481.   We\n\nrecognized that \"efforts to provide postconviction relief to\n\nDookhan defendants [had] been hampered by the inability of CPCS\n\nto ascertain which cases may have been tainted by Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct,\" and that \"[t]he ability of CPCS to identify clients\n\nand to assign them attorneys who will represent their interests\n\nin postconviction proceedings is crucial to the administration\n\nof justice in the Hinton . . . lab cases.\"   Id. at 480.   We\n\nremanded the case to the single justice for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with the opinion.   Id. at 494.\n\n     The single justice joined as respondents the district\n\nattorneys for the Cape and Islands, Middlesex, Norfolk, and\n\nPlymouth districts, and allowed the motion of the district\n\nattorney for the Bristol district to intervene.    The single\n\njustice ordered the district attorneys to produce lists with the\n\nnames, docket numbers, and personal identifying information for\n\nevery \"adverse disposition concerning every G. L. c. 94C charge\"\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Only the district attorneys for the Suffolk and Essex\ndistricts were parties to Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 481. They\nprovided CPCS with the relevant docket numbers in their\ndistricts in September, 2014. Id. at 478 n.20. The district\nattorneys for the Bristol and Norfolk districts later provided\nCPCS with the relevant docket numbers before the issuance of the\nopinion in Bridgeman I. Id. The district attorneys for the\nCape and Islands, Middlesex, and Plymouth districts had yet to\ndo so at the time that opinion issued. Id.\n\f                                                                 19\n\n\nof the \"Dookhan defendants.\"10   In May, 2016, the district\n\nattorneys produced lists that contained the names of more than\n\n20,000 defendants with more than 24,000 cases where they had\n\npleaded guilty to a drug charge, had admitted to sufficient\n\nfacts to warrant a finding of guilty of a drug charge, or had\n\nbeen found guilty at trial of a drug charge where Dookhan had\n\ntested the alleged drugs as the primary or confirmatory\n\nchemist.11\n\n\n     10\n       Because the list encompasses the \"Dookhan defendants,\" it\nincludes some defendants who are not \"relevant Dookhan\ndefendants.\" See note 8 and accompanying text, supra.\n     11\n       The lists were the product of the commendable and\nlaborious efforts of the Trial Court's information technology\ndepartment, which identified the set of all cases with a G. L.\nc. 94C charge from 2003 to June, 2011, and of the district\nattorneys' offices, which then identified the subset of these\ncases where Dookhan was the primary or confirmatory chemist.\nThe district attorneys state that they have identified\napproximately 20,544 defendants in 24,577 cases that featured at\nleast some evidence tested by Dookhan and that resulted in an\nadverse consequence. The CPCS data analyst identified 24,391\ncases in which defendants still face adverse dispositions on\ndrug charges where Dookhan was the primary or confirmatory\nchemist. Both parties contend that the respective tallies are\nnot a perfect measure of the remaining pool of cases tainted by\nDookhan's misconduct. As earlier stated, these lists include\ndefendants who are not relevant Dookhan defendants because they\npleaded guilty or admitted to sufficient facts before Dookhan\nsigned the drug certificate as an assistant analyst. The\ndistrict attorneys claim that, apart from including the so-\ncalled Ruffin defendants, the lists overcount the number of\nrelevant Dookhan defendants because they include some defendants\nwho already moved to vacate their pleas, and because they\ninclude defendants who were codefendants in a case where Dookhan\nwas an assistant analyst. The Bridgeman petitioners and CPCS\nclaim that the lists actually undercount the number of remaining\ndefendants because of errors in the district attorneys' data.\n\f                                                                   20\n\n\n     The single justice also asked the parties to attempt to\n\nagree on the content of a letter of notice to the Dookhan\n\ndefendants informing them that their drug cases had been\n\npotentially tainted by Dookhan's misconduct.   After the\n\nsubmission of the lists, however, the Bridgeman petitioners and\n\nCPCS12 would not agree to any notice that presumed case-by-case\n\nlitigation, because they contended that, given the large number\n\nof Dookhan defendants and the limited resources of CPCS, the\n\nnotice could not truthfully inform the Dookhan defendants that\n\nattorneys were available to represent them in these cases.    They\n\nasked the single justice to reserve and report to the full court\n\nthe question \"whether all cases involving misconduct by Annie\n\nDookhan should be dismissed or subjected to a court-ordered\n\ndeadline.\"   The district attorneys opposed the reservation and\n\nreport, arguing that the notices would provide all Dookhan\n\ndefendants the opportunity to seek relief.   They also contended\n\n\n\nWe need not resolve these differences and ascertain the precise\nnumber of relevant Dookhan defendants because, even if we were\nto adopt the district attorneys' estimates, there would still be\nclose to 20,000 relevant Dookhan defendants who might be\nentitled to postconviction relief.\n     12\n       For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to both the\nBridgeman I petitioners and CPCS as the \"Bridgeman petitioners\"\nfor the remainder of this opinion, even though we recognize that\nCPCS is an intervener rather than a petitioner in this case. We\nrefer to the \"Bridgeman petitioners\" because this is a civil\ncase seeking declaratory relief, even though we recognize that\nthe Bridgeman petitioners are each Dookhan defendants in\ncriminal cases.\n\f                                                                     21\n\n\nthat the Bridgeman petitioners \"significantly overstate[] the\n\napparent degree of interest on the part of the Dookhan\n\ndefendants in revisiting settled cases.\"    The single justice\n\nissued a reservation and report on August 16, 2016.\n\n    The district attorneys advised the single justice before\n\nthe issuance of the reservation and report that they intended to\n\nsend notices regardless of whether the case was reported to the\n\nfull court.   On August 29, 2016, the district attorneys filed in\n\nthe county court a letter attaching the notice they intended to\n\nsend on or before September 1.    The Bridgeman petitioners\n\ninformed the district attorneys that the notice was misleading\n\nand poorly translated.     At a hearing on September 6, the single\n\njustice invited the district attorneys to delay sending the\n\nnotice, but the district attorneys announced that the mailing\n\nhad already begun.   On September 7, CPCS filed an emergency\n\nmotion asking the full court to halt further dissemination of\n\nthe notice; the court denied the motion but ordered the district\n\nattorneys to keep records of all documents and communications\n\narising from the notice.\n\n    The notice was mailed in an envelope with the return\n\naddress of \"RG/2 Claims Administration LLC,\" and a post office\n\nbox in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, along with the words\n\n\"IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS\"\n\f                                                                    22\n\n\nnear the return address.13    The notice informed each defendant\n\nthat, according to court records, he or she was convicted of one\n\nor more drug offenses in a specified county between 2003 and\n\n2011; that it has been determined that Dookhan tested the drugs\n\nin the case; and that Dookhan \"admitted to misconduct in her\n\nwork at the [Hinton] lab.\"    It advised the defendant that,\n\nbecause Dookhan tested the evidence, he or she has certain\n\nrights, specifically, \"the right to challenge the drug\n\nconviction(s) listed in this notice\" and that \"if [the defendant\n\nis] tried and convicted again, [he or she] will not face any\n\npunishment greater than what [he or she] already received.\"    The\n\nnotice asked the defendant to contact his or her original lawyer\n\non the case if he or she has any questions, and also invited the\n\ndefendant to speak with a new lawyer.    The notice further\n\ninvited the defendant, should he or she not know how to contact\n\nthe original lawyer, to get that information at the criminal\n\nclerk's office where the case was adjudicated, and provided the\n\nWeb site address where the physical address of the relevant\n\ncourt can be found.14\n\n\n\n     13\n       RG/2 Claims Administration, LLC, is the vendor who\ncontracted with the district attorneys to distribute the notice.\n     14\n          The full English text of the notice is reprinted below:\n\n     \"Dear [recipient]:\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\n     A Spanish translation of the notice was included on the\n\nbottom of the page.

O'Laughlin, a qualified Spanish\ninterpreter, who attested that \"the Spanish translation\ncontained within [the notice letter] is not accurate or clear.\"\nHe identified various flagrant errors in the translation of the\nnotice, including the following:\n\f                                                                   24\n\n\nThe district attorneys have not offered any evidence to rebut\n\nthese claims or to defend the quality of the translation.\n\n      The district attorneys' vendor mailed 20,916 letters to\n\nDookhan defendants.16   The vendor was unable to locate the\n\naddresses for 1,006 defendants, and 5,767 of the letters that\n\nwere sent were returned undelivered.   For those letters returned\n\nundelivered, the vendor searched for a secondary address and\n\nsent out an additional 964 notices.    As of October 24, 2016, the\n\nover-all response rate to these mailings was extremely low:\n\n     In the Bristol district, where approximately 2,200 cases\n      were identified, the district attorney received thirty-nine\n      telephone calls and three motions were filed.\n     In the Cape and Islands district, where approximately 1,300\n      cases were identified, the district attorney received\n      thirty-nine calls and one walk-in inquiry. No motions were\n      filed.\n     In the Essex district, where approximately 4,200 cases were\n      identified, the district attorney received forty-six\n      telephone calls and twelve walk-in inquiries. Seven\n      motions were filed.\n\n\n     The word \"vacated\" was translated in the notice as\n      \"desocupar,\" meaning to physically vacate premises, not to\n      vacate a judicial decision.\n     The verb tense in the same sentence was changed so that it\n      appeared that a successful motion may yield only the\n      possibility that the conviction would be vacated.\n     The translation of \"criminal clerk's office\" described a\n      clerk who is himself also a violent felon.\n\nO'Laughlin also described the translation of a crucial sentence\nin the notice explaining the district attorney's ability to\nretry the recipient's case as \"unintelligible.\"\n      16\n       Because some defendants had cases in multiple counties,\nthe number of letters that were mailed exceeded the number of\ndefendants identified in the lists.\n\f                                                                   25\n\n\n     In the Middlesex district, where approximately 3,500 cases\n      were identified, the district attorney received seventy-\n      seven telephone calls and seven walk-in inquiries.

In response, the\n      office has moved to vacate and enter a nolle prosequi in\n      175 of these cases. No motions to withdraw a guilty plea\n      or admission to sufficient facts were filed by defendants.\n\nIn sum, in response to approximately 21,000 letters sent by the\n\nvendor to Dookhan defendants early in September, 2016, as of\n\nOctober 24, 2016, only twenty motions for postconviction relief\n\nwere filed by defendants and 175 motions were filed by\n\nprosecutors.   In other words, the notice triggered applications\n\nfor postconviction relief in less than one per cent of these\n\ncases.17\n\n\n      17\n       The Bridgeman petitioners have filed a motion to expand\nthe record to add an affidavit from Nancy J. Caplan, the CPCS\nattorney in charge of its Hinton lab crisis litigation unit\n(unit), which was created in April, 2013, to address indigent\ndefense matters relevant to the representation of Dookhan\ndefendants. Caplan attests that, after the district attorneys\nsent the notice, CPCS asked the courts in the eight affected\ncounties and all bar advocates to direct all inquiries arising\nfrom the notice to the unit so that CPCS could \"provide counsel\nto indigent Dookhan defendants so long as it had the resources\nnecessary to do so.\" She declares that, as of October 31, 2016,\nthe unit had received inquiries arising from the notice from 139\nDookhan defendants, who were defendants in 162 cases in which\nDookhan was the primary or confirmatory chemist.\n\f                                                                  26\n\n\n    Discussion.

They\n\ncontend that due process requires such a global remedy because,\n\neven though four years have now passed since the scope of\n\nDookhan's misconduct was revealed, the defendants' entitlement\n\nto a new trial on their drug convictions has yet to be\n\nadjudicated in more than 24,000 cases.

They claim that a global remedy is a necessary\n\nexercise of our superintendence authority because a case-by-case\n\nadjudication of so many cases is \"doomed to fail\" given the\n\nlimited resources of the Commonwealth's indigent criminal\n\ndefense system.\n\n    The district attorneys respond that \"[t]here is no\n\nconvincing reason to retreat from the thoughtful remedies-based,\n\nworkable solution designed by the [c]ourt.\"   They contend that\n\nthe notice mailed to the Dookhan defendants was fair, and that\n\nthe low response to the notice reflects that many defendants\n\n\"may conclude that they face no adverse impact at all from a\n\nclosed chapter in their lives,\" and \"feel no urgency\" to reopen\n\ntheir case \"before an adverse impact actually occurs.\"    They\n\ncontend that, in light of the Dookhan defendants' response to\n\nthat notice, it is apparent that the Bridgeman petitioners have\n\ngreatly overstated the burden that will arise from case-by-case\n\nadjudication of motions for a new trial.   They also argue that\n\nwe should not vacate the convictions of Dookhan defendants who\n\nhave not moved to do so, because \"mass vacatur would constitute\n\na complete abandonment of the careful weighing of the interests\n\nof defendants, the public, and the criminal justice system that\n\f                                                                  28\n\n\nthis [c]ourt set out in Scott, and affirmed in [Bridgeman I] and\n\nthe cases that followed.\"   They contend that the remedy of\n\ndismissal with prejudice is not justified as a matter of law,\n\nand that the remedy of dismissal without prejudice, allowing the\n\nreprosecution of these cases, would be unfair to impose on\n\ndefendants who did not move for such relief, because it would\n\nsubject them without their approval to a new trial and the risk\n\nof arrest if they failed to appear.   In short, the district\n\nattorneys argue that we should stay the course, because\n\nindividual case-by-case adjudication of motions for a new trial\n\nbrought by Dookhan defendants is both practical and fair.\n\n    1.    Four relevant principles of our criminal justice\n\nsystem.   In Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 487, we recognized that\n\n\"we cannot expect defendants to bear the burden of a systemic\n\nlapse,\" but we declined to implement a global remedy \"at this\n\ntime\" because we would not \"allow the misconduct of one person\n\nto dictate an abrupt retreat from the fundamentals of our\n\ncriminal justice system\" (citation omitted).   In revisiting here\n\nwhether the time is now ripe to implement a global remedy, it is\n\nimportant to explain four relevant principles of our criminal\n\njustice system that have guided our prior decisions relating to\n\nthis matter.   First, where there is egregious misconduct\n\nattributable to the government in the investigation or\n\nprosecution of a criminal case, the government bears the burden\n\f                                                                    29\n\n\nof taking reasonable steps to remedy that misconduct.    See\n\nStrickler v. Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (1999) (discussing\n\n\"special role played by the American prosecutor in the search\n\nfor truth in criminal trials\" and broad duty to disclose\n\nexculpatory information); Bridgeman I, supra at 480-481.       Those\n\nreasonable steps include the obligation to timely and\n\neffectively notify the defendant of egregious misconduct\n\naffecting the defendant's criminal case.   See Ferrara, 456 F.3d\n\nat 293 (government's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to\n\ndefendant \"was so outrageous that it constituted impermissible\n\nprosecutorial misconduct sufficient to ground the petitioner's\n\nclaim that his guilty plea was involuntary\"); Mass. R. Prof. C.\n\n3.8 (d), as appearing in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016) (\"The prosecutor\n\nin a criminal case shall . . . make timely disclosure to the\n\ndefense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor\n\nthat tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the\n\noffense . . .\").\n\n    As applied here, prosecutors had a responsibility timely\n\nand effectively to disclose Dookhan's misconduct to all affected\n\ndefendants because Dookhan might erroneously have found\n\nsubstances that were not controlled substances to be a\n\ncontrolled substance, or to be a certain weight, creating the\n\nrisk that a defendant may have been found guilty of a drug crime\n\nhe or she did not commit.   In addition, her egregious misconduct\n\f                                                                   30\n\n\nput in question the accuracy of the drug analysis and the\n\nability of the government to prove the nature and weight of the\n\nalleged drugs beyond a reasonable doubt, which a defendant is\n\nentitled to consider in making an informed and voluntary\n\ndecision whether to waive the right to trial and plead guilty\n\n(or admit to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt), or\n\nto proceed to trial.   The cost of notifying defendants of\n\negregious government misconduct must be borne by the prosecuting\n\ndistrict attorney's office, even if, as here, the fault belongs\n\nto the Hinton lab and Dookhan, not the prosecutors.\n\n    Second, under our criminal rules, relief from a conviction\n\ngenerally requires the defendant to file a motion for a new\n\ntrial.   See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1501</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001) (judge \"upon motion in writing may grant a new trial\n\nat any time if it appears that justice may not have been done\"\n\n[emphasis added]).

Cronk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2064802\"><a href=\"/opinion/2064802/commonwealth-v-cronk/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (1985).\n\nWhere a motion for a new trial is allowed, the conviction is\n\f                                                                       31\n\n\nvacated, and the prosecutor may retry the defendant on the same\n\ncharge, unless the judge, apart from the vacatur, also dismisses\n\nthe complaint or indictment with prejudice.       We have identified\n\n\"[t]wo parallel legal principles\" governing when this last\n\nresort might be necessary, balancing the rights of defendants\n\n\"against the necessity for preserving society's interest in the\n\nadministration of justice.\"     Id. at 198-199.   Under one legal\n\nprinciple, where a prosecutor fails to disclose evidence the\n\ndefendant is entitled to receive and the defendant is prejudiced\n\nby the failure to disclose, a motion to dismiss with prejudice\n\nshould be allowed only where there is \"a showing of irremediable\n\nharm to the defendant's opportunity to obtain a fair trial.\"\n\nId. at 198.   Dismissal with prejudice is \"too drastic a remedy\"\n\nif the error can be remedied and the defendant can still obtain\n\na fair trial.   Id. at 200, and cases cited.\n\n    \"Under the alternative principle, prosecutorial misconduct\n\nthat is egregious, deliberate, and intentional, or that results\n\nin a violation of constitutional rights may give rise to\n\npresumptive prejudice.   In such instances prophylactic\n\nconsiderations may assume paramount importance and the 'drastic\n\nremedy' of dismissal of charges may become an appropriate\n\nremedy.\"   Id. at 198-199.    This alternative principle is\n\nnarrowly applied; \"the only reason to dismiss criminal charges\n\nbecause of nonprejudicial but egregious police misconduct would\n\f                                                                  32\n\n\nbe to create a climate adverse to repetition of that misconduct\n\nthat would not otherwise exist.\"   Commonwealth v.

Commonwealth v.

We concluded that this was \"a\n\ndeliberate and intentional attack by government agents on the\n\nrelationship between Manning and his counsel in a calculated\n\nattempt to coerce the defendant into abandoning his defense,\"\n\nid. at 443, and that \"the officers' misconduct was so pervasive\n\nas to preclude any confident assumption that proceedings at a\n\nnew trial would be free of the taint,\" id. at 444.   We also\n\nconcluded that a \"stronger deterrent\" than a new trial was\n\nwarranted for this type of misconduct.   Id.\n\n    In Scott and Francis, the remedy that we found appropriate\n\nin cases where a defendant shows prejudice arising from\n\nDookhan's misconduct was the allowance of a motion for a new\n\ntrial and the vacatur of the conviction.   We did not order the\n\ndismissal of the defendant's drug charges with prejudice, or\n\f                                                                     33\n\n\nsuggest that was an appropriate remedy for Dookhan's misconduct\n\nunder either of the alternative legal principles.     Although the\n\nrecord does not provide us with data as to the number of\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants who were reprosecuted after their\n\nmotions for a new trial were allowed, we are aware that some\n\ndefendants were retried and that other defendants later pleaded\n\nguilty or admitted to sufficient facts to support a guilty\n\nfinding.\n\n    Fourth, where large numbers of persons have been wronged,\n\nthe wrong must be remedied in a manner that is not only fair as\n\na matter of justice, but also timely and practical.

Revisiting the need for a global remedy.   We now\n\nconsider, in light of all that has happened and all that we have\n\nlearned since Bridgeman I, whether we should revisit our\n\ndecision to decline to adopt a global remedy \"at this time\" to\n\nresolve the cases of the relevant Dookhan defendants.\n\nBridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 487.\n\n    a.   The district attorneys' proposal to stay the course.\n\nThe district attorneys contend that our previous decisions have\n\nprovided an adequate remedy to the relevant Dookhan defendants.\n\nThis argument relies on the key premise that the notice mailed\n\nto the Dookhan defendants adequately informed them that\n\nDookhan's misconduct affected their criminal case and that, as a\n\nresult, they may seek to vacate their drug conviction.\n\n    We reject this premise; we agree with the Bridgeman\n\npetitioners that the notice sent by the district attorneys was\n\nwholly inadequate to provide the relevant Dookhan defendants\n\nwith the information necessary to knowingly and voluntarily\n\ndecide whether they should explore with counsel the possibility\n\f                                                                  36\n\n\nof withdrawing their plea or moving for a new trial.   The\n\nshortcomings begin with the envelope itself, which identified\n\nthe source of the letter as \"RG/2 Claims Administration LLC,\" a\n\nsource that would appear inconsistent with the words on the\n\nenvelope, \"IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF\n\nMASSACHUSETTS.\"   Such an envelope invites the risk that the\n\nnotice might be unopened and discarded as \"junk mail.\"\n\n     Among the shortcomings of the letter itself are that it\n\nfailed adequately to inform the Dookhan defendants that the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court has determined that they are entitled to\n\na conclusive presumption that the drug analysis in their case\n\nwas tainted by egregious government misconduct.   Nor did it\n\nadequately inform them that, as a result, this court has\n\ndetermined that they are entitled to withdraw their guilty plea18\n\non drug charges if they can show a reasonable probability that\n\nthey would not have pleaded guilty, and instead would have\n\ndecided to go to trial, had they known of Dookhan's misconduct.\n\n     18\n       We recognize that recipients of the letter include both\nindividuals who pleaded guilty to Dookhan-related charges and\nthose who admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a guilty\nfinding. Because such an admission is the \"functional\nequivalent of a guilty plea\" under G. L. c. 278, § 29D, and\nbecause it exposes a defendant to some of the same collateral\nconsequences as a guilty plea, see Commonwealth v. Villalobos,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (2002), we treat the admission the same as a\nguilty plea for the purposes of a motion for new trial. Luk v.\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 n.6 (1995). In the remaining\ndiscussion we refer to a guilty plea and an admission to\nsufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty, collectively,\nas a \"guilty plea.\" See Scott, 467 Mass. at 337 n.1.\n\f                                                                  37\n\n\nNor did it adequately inform them that, if they had been\n\nconvicted of a drug charge at trial, they are entitled to a new\n\ntrial if the admission in evidence of their drug analysis might\n\nhave significantly influenced the jury in reaching their\n\nverdict.     The letter explained that, if their challenge to their\n\ndrug conviction were to succeed, their conviction would be\n\nvacated and their \"case will be returned to active status,\" but\n\ndid not explain what it meant for their case to be on \"active\n\nstatus.\"19    The Spanish translation of the letter is so poor that\n\nthe letter might not be understood by persons who speak only\n\nSpanish.\n\n     The letter also failed to inform the Dookhan defendants\n\nthat they had a right to counsel if they sought to withdraw\n\ntheir plea or move for a new trial and that, if they could not\n\nafford counsel, one would be appointed for them.    Instead, it\n\ninvited them to speak to their original lawyer on the case and,\n\nif they did not know how to contact that lawyer, invited them to\n\nobtain that information from the relevant criminal clerk's\n\noffice.20    The letter also invited them to contact the office of\n\nthe district attorney who prosecuted them \"[f]or more\n\n     19\n       The letter did explain that, if the district attorney\ndecided to try them again on the vacated drug charge, they would\nnot face punishment greater than what they had earlier received\nif they were convicted.\n     20\n       The letter also told recipients that they \"may also\nchoose to speak to a new lawyer.\"\n\f                                                                  38\n\n\ninformation.\"   It did not provide a telephone number for CPCS or\n\nfor any other entity that conducts criminal defense.\n\n    Apart from the deficiencies in the notice, we know that a\n\nsubstantial number of the Dookhan defendants did not receive the\n\nletter, because 5,767 were returned as undeliverable.   An\n\nadditional 964 notices were sent to secondary addresses for\n\nthese individuals in an attempt to locate them, but we do not\n\nknow how many of these letters were returned as undeliverable.\n\nNo public notice, either through the newspaper, television, or\n\nsocial media, was attempted to provide notice to those whose\n\ncurrent address could not be located.\n\n    We are skeptical of the district attorneys' explanation\n\nthat so few of the Dookhan defendants chose to respond to the\n\nletter because most were not interested in \"reopening a closed\n\nchapter in their lives before an adverse impact actually occurs\"\n\nand others believed that \"they face no adverse impact at all\"\n\nfrom this conviction.   We recognize that few, if any, of the\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants continue to be incarcerated on a\n\ndrug conviction tainted by Dookhan's misconduct, but that does\n\nnot mean that they lack a strong reason to seek to have this\n\nconviction vacated, given the serious and pervasive collateral\n\nconsequences that arise from a drug conviction.

In short, the adverse\n\nconsequences of an unjust conviction do not end when one\n\ncompletes a jail or prison term, or a probationary period.\n\nGiven the inadequacy of the notice provided by the district\n\nattorneys, the remarkably low response to that notice, and the\n\nsevere collateral consequences of drug convictions, justice and\n\nfairness do not permit us simply to stay the course set in\n\nBridgeman I.\n\n       b.   The Bridgeman petitioners' proposal for a global\n\nremedy.     The Bridgeman petitioners contend that, even with\n\nadequate notice, no remedy premised on case-by-case adjudication\n\ncan work.    They argue that, because of the severely limited\n\nresources of CPCS -- the amount of State funding, the number of\n\nqualified bar advocates, and the legislative limits on the\n\nnumber of hours that bar advocates annually may bill to CPCS --\n\nCPCS cannot possibly assign qualified counsel to represent all\n\nthe defendants who would file the postconviction motions that\n\f                                                                   41\n\n\nwould result from truly adequate notice.   They therefore contend\n\nthat it is both illusory and misleading to inform defendants\n\nthat, if they are indigent, counsel will be assigned to\n\nrepresent them, where that will simply not be possible.     They\n\ncontend that the only just and practical alternative under these\n\ncircumstances is the global remedy they propose, in which we\n\nwould vacate the drug convictions of all relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants and dismiss them with prejudice, or dismiss them\n\nwithout prejudice and allow prosecutors one year to reprosecute\n\nthese cases before they, too, would be dismissed with prejudice.\n\n    The proposed global remedy, however, is neither as just nor\n\nas practical as the Bridgeman petitioners claim, and it would be\n\ninconsistent with some of the principles that we earlier\n\narticulated.   In Scott and Francis, we granted relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants a conclusive presumption of egregious government\n\nmisconduct, but we did not grant them a conclusive presumption\n\nof prejudice; defendants still bore the burden of proving\n\nprejudice.   Where a relevant Dookhan defendant filed a motion to\n\nwithdraw a plea or for a new trial, and failed to prove\n\nprejudice, the motion was denied.   The global remedy proposed by\n\nthe Bridgeman petitioners would effectively declare a conclusive\n\npresumption of prejudice.\n\n    Even where a relevant Dookhan defendant proved prejudice,\n\nthe defendant only obtained a new trial under Scott and Francis,\n\f                                                                    42\n\n\nnot a dismissal with prejudice.   Dookhan's conduct, serious as\n\nit was, did not result in \"irremediable harm to the defendant's\n\nopportunity to obtain a fair trial.\"    Cronk, 396 Mass. at 198.\n\nRather, it meant that the Commonwealth had to retest the\n\nsubstance claimed to be a controlled substance and offer\n\nevidence of that new drug analysis at a retrial, or otherwise\n\nprove that the substance possessed or distributed by the\n\ndefendant was a controlled substance.   Nor, given the absence of\n\nany evidence of misconduct by a prosecutor or investigator, did\n\nwe place Dookhan's misconduct in the category that requires a\n\nstronger deterrent than a new trial to avoid the risk of\n\nrepetition.   See Lewin, 405 Mass. at 587; Manning, 373 Mass. at\n\n444.   A dismissal with prejudice for government misconduct is\n\nvery strong medicine, and it should be prescribed only when the\n\ngovernment misconduct is so intentional and so egregious that a\n\nnew trial is not an adequate remedy.    We did not prescribe this\n\nmedicine in Scott and Francis, and we are not convinced that it\n\nis appropriate to do so now.   And if we were to prescribe it\n\nnow, we would equitably have to address the claims of those who\n\nearlier prevailed in proving prejudice and therefore won a new\n\ntrial, but not a dismissal with prejudice, and subsequently\n\neither again pleaded guilty to the same or lesser charges or\n\nwere convicted at a new trial of the drug charges.    They could\n\f                                                                   43\n\n\njustly contend that they are as entitled to a dismissal with\n\nprejudice as are those who did not move for a new trial.\n\n    To vacate the convictions of all relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants without prejudice would present other problems of\n\njustice and practicality.   We require a defendant to move for a\n\nnew trial for a reason -- without a motion, we cannot be sure\n\nthat a defendant wishes to accept the risk that the Commonwealth\n\nwill retry the defendant rather than issue a nolle prosequi.\n\nEven though, as a result of our decision in Bridgeman I, 471\n\nMass. at 477, a defendant at a new trial would not be risking\n\nconviction of a more serious crime or a longer sentence, a\n\ndefendant who is retried would still have to appear in court\n\nwhen directed by the judge and endure the uncertainty and\n\ndisruption inherent in being a defendant in a criminal trial.\n\nWe might be skeptical of the district attorneys' contention that\n\nmost of the relevant Dookhan defendants do not wish to reopen \"a\n\nclosed chapter in their lives,\" but it would not be surprising\n\nif some defendants have no wish to relitigate their earlier\n\ncriminal cases and instead simply want to move on with their\n\nlives.\n\n    Although we reject the global remedy proposed by the\n\nBridgeman petitioners, we accept two premises of their argument.\n\nFirst, in light of the unusual circumstances of the relevant\n\nDookhan defendants, all who are indigent and wish to explore\n\f                                                                  44\n\n\nwhether to move for a new trial under Mass.

We so order; we need not wait for each motion judge to\n\nrule individually on the question of the assignment of counsel\n\nwhere it is plain that the absence of counsel under these\n\nunusual circumstances would deny an indigent defendant\n\n\"meaningful access\" or result in \"fundamental unfairness,\" and\n\ntherefore deprive the defendant of his or her constitutional\n\nrights to due process and to counsel.   The right to appointed\n\ncounsel applies here regardless of whether the relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendant has completed his or her sentence, because the severe\n\ncollateral consequences arising from a drug conviction do not\n\nend at the conclusion of a defendant's sentence.\n\n    Moreover, where an indigent criminal defendant has a right\n\nto counsel, \"[t]he duty to provide such counsel falls squarely\n\non government, and the burden of a systemic lapse is not to be\n\nborne by defendants.\"   Lavallee v.

If CPCS, despite its best efforts, were unable to\n\nassign counsel to a defendant in a reasonably timely manner --\n\nwhether the reason be the absence of necessary funding by the\n\nLegislature, the inability of CPCS to qualify adequate numbers\n\nof private attorneys to serve as bar advocates because of the\n\nlow hourly fee mandated by the Legislature,21 the unavailability\n\nof qualified bar advocates because of the limitation on the\n\n\n\n\n     21\n       The present statutory hourly rate for bar advocates is\nfifty-three dollars for cases in the District Court and the\nBoston Municipal Court, and sixty dollars for nonhomicide cases\nin the Superior Court. G. L. c. 211D, § 11 (a). The only\nchange to these hourly rates since 2005 has been that the rate\napplicable for cases in the District Court and Boston Municipal\nCourt was increased from fifty dollars to fifty-three dollars in\n2015.

See\n\nLavallee, supra at 244.   In Lavallee, where the list of CPCS-\n\nqualified attorneys available to accept assignments in Hampden\n\nCounty was inadequate to ensure the provision of counsel to\n\nthose with a right to counsel, the remedy we ordered was that a\n\ncriminal case against an indigent defendant must be dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice if an attorney had not filed an appearance\n\nwithin forty-five days of arraignment.   Id. at 246.\n\n     We recognize that, if a substantial percentage of relevant\n\nDookhan defendants were to seek postconviction relief after\n\n\n     22\n       The annual cap on billable hours for bar advocates is\n1,650 hours, and a bar advocate may not accept any new\nappointment in a nonhomicide case after having billed 1,350\nhours in that fiscal year. G. L. c. 211D, § 11 (b), (c). In\n2016, in response to a shortage of bar advocates in care and\nprotection cases and children and family law cases, the\nLegislature enacted legislation allowing the chief counsel of\nCPCS, under certain circumstances, to waive the annual cap on\nbillable hours for bar advocates assigned to these cases,\nprovided that such a bar advocate not bill in excess of 1,800\nbillable hours for the year. G. L. c. 211D, § 11(d), amended\nthrough St. 2016, c. 133, § 119. A comparable increase in the\nannual cap on billable hours potentially could be enacted for\nbar advocates assigned to criminal cases or, alternatively, the\ntime devoted to the representation of relevant Dookhan\ndefendants could be exempted from the annual cap.\n\f                                                                      48\n\n\nreceiving truly adequate notice, the capacity of CPCS to assign\n\nqualified attorneys to represent these defendants in case-by-\n\ncase adjudication would soon be overwhelmed.   Therefore, unless\n\nthe district attorneys were to move to vacate and dismiss with\n\nprejudice the drug convictions of large numbers of relevant\n\nDookhan defendants, case-by-case adjudication poses the\n\nconsiderable risk that the demand of indigent Dookhan defendants\n\nfor counsel might outstrip the supply of CPCS-qualified\n\nattorneys to represent them, and require this court to implement\n\nan appropriate remedy under our general superintendence\n\nauthority for the constitutional violation suffered by indigent\n\ncriminal defendants who are denied their right to counsel.       If\n\npast is prologue, that remedy will likely be the dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice of their challenged drug convictions.       See\n\nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 246.\n\n    c.   New protocol for case-by-case adjudication.    The\n\nextraordinary magnitude of Dookhan's misconduct has left us with\n\nonly poor alternatives.    We continue to believe that, despite\n\nits considerable risks and burdens, case-by-case adjudication is\n\nthe fairest and best alternative to resolve the drug cases\n\npotentially tainted by Dookhan's misconduct and the alternative\n\nmost consistent and in harmony with the relevant principles of\n\ncriminal justice that have and continue to guide us in this\n\nextraordinary situation.    But we recognize that, in light of the\n\f                                                                  49\n\n\npotential need to adjudicate more than 20,000 motions for a new\n\ntrial brought by the relevant Dookhan defendants, case-by-case\n\nadjudication must be adapted to make it both fair and workable.\n\n     The success of case-by-case adjudication will depend on the\n\ncooperation of the district attorneys, who will have to examine\n\neach drug conviction of each relevant Dookhan defendant in their\n\ndistrict and determine which cases they reasonably could and\n\nwould reprosecute if a motion for a new trial were granted, and\n\nmove to vacate and dismiss with prejudice the rest.23   We rely on\n\nthe exercise of the district attorneys' sound discretion to\n\nreduce substantially the number of relevant Dookhan defendants.\n\nWe note that it appears that the majority of the drug\n\nconvictions of relevant Dookhan defendants were of possession\n\n\n\n\n     23\n       In a letter to the Governor on September 6, 2012, after\nlearning of the investigation of the Hinton lab, the district\nattorneys declared, \"If there has been any miscarriage of\njustice due to the actions of Annie Dookhan or anyone else at\nthe [Hinton lab], correcting those miscarriages must be the\nfirst priority.\" Press Release, MDAA Letter to Gov. Patrick Re:\nDPH Drug Lab, State House News Serv. (Sept. 11, 2012). At oral\nargument, the district attorneys similarly assured the court\nthat they will exercise their sound discretion in handling\nmotions for a new trial brought by the relevant Dookhan\ndefendants.\n\f                                                                  50\n\n\nalone,24 that approximately ninety per cent of these convictions\n\nwere obtained in the District Court or in the Boston Municipal\n\nCourt (which means that the drug charges were either\n\nmisdemeanors or felonies for which the district attorney did not\n\nchoose to seek indictments), and that virtually all of these\n\ndefendants have already served the entirety of their sentences\n\nfor these drug convictions.\n\n     Its success also depends on the cooperation of CPCS, which\n\nwill have to make best efforts in using the funding appropriated\n\nby the Legislature to assign counsel to the relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants who, after new notice, choose to explore the filing\n\nof a motion for a new trial.   We look to CPCS also for its\n\ncreativity and ingenuity in finding ways to assign attorneys to\n\nrepresent as many relevant Dookhan defendants as is reasonably\n\npossible.\n\n     To accomplish case-by-case adjudication of the drug cases\n\nof potentially more than 20,000 relevant Dookhan defendants, we\n\nestablish the following protocol, to be completed in three\n\n\n\n\n     24\n       An analysis conducted by Paola Villarreal, a data science\nfellow at the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of\nMassachusetts, revealed that approximately sixty-two per cent of\nthe adverse drug dispositions for Dookhan defendants were for\npossession alone. At oral argument, in answer to a question\nposed by a Justice, a prosecutor stated that he \"[did] not know\"\nwhether a majority of these cases were for \"straight\npossession.\"\n\f                                                                     51\n\n\nphases, and order its implementation by the single justice in\n\nthe form of a declaratory judgment.\n\n     i.   Phase one.   Upon the issuance of this opinion, each\n\ndistrict attorney shall commence an individualized review of\n\nevery Dookhan case in his or her district that was included on\n\nthe list that the district attorney earlier submitted to the\n\nsingle justice.   No later than ninety days after the issuance of\n\nthis opinion, each district attorney shall file three letters\n\nwith the county clerk.25\n\n     The first letter shall identify all defendants on the list\n\nwho are not relevant Dookhan defendants because they pleaded\n\nguilty to a drug charge before Dookhan signed the drug\n\ncertification and therefore are not entitled to the conclusive\n\npresumption of egregious government misconduct.     In short, this\n\nletter shall identify all of the so-called Ruffin defendants.\n\nSee Ruffin, 475 Mass. at 1003.\n\n     The second letter shall identify all of the drug\n\nconvictions on the list that the district attorney moves to\n\nvacate and dismiss with prejudice as a result of his or her\n\nindividualized review.     These shall include both the convictions\n\nthat the district attorney wishes to vacate and dismiss with\n\nprejudice, regardless of whether the case could be successfully\n\n     25\n       We recognize the difference between the date of the\nissuance of our opinion and the date of the rescript, and have\nspecifically selected the former as the starting date.\n\f                                                                     52\n\n\nreprosecuted if a new trial were ordered, and the convictions\n\nthat the district attorney could not successfully reprosecute if\n\na new trial were ordered.    Once these drug convictions are\n\nvacated and dismissed with prejudice, the defendants shall be\n\nnotified of the action taken.26\n\n     The third letter shall identify all drug convictions on the\n\nlist that the district attorney does not move to vacate and\n\ndismiss with prejudice.     For each such conviction, the district\n\nattorney shall certify that, if a motion for a new trial were\n\nallowed, the district attorney could produce evidence at a\n\nretrial, independent of Dookhan's signed drug certificate or\n\ntestimony, sufficient to permit a rational jury to find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the substance at issue was the controlled\n\nsubstance alleged in the complaint or indictment.     Such\n\nindependent evidence may include, for example, retesting of the\n\noriginal drug evidence, a positive field test, or a specific\n\nadmission by the defendant regarding his or her knowledge of the\n\nnature of the substance that was made before Dookhan signed the\n\ndrug certificate in the case.     Only the relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants identified in the third letter shall be provided with\n\nnew notice in phase two, discussed infra.\n\n     26\n       Where a defendant pleaded guilty to multiple charges at a\nplea hearing or was convicted at trial of multiple counts, the\nvacatur of these drug convictions with prejudice will not affect\nany nondrug convictions or any drug convictions where Dookhan\nwas not the primary or confirmatory analyst.\n\f                                                                  53\n\n\n     In light of the massive number of relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendants and the scope of misconduct attributable to the\n\ngovernment (albeit not to the prosecutors), it is only fair that\n\ndistrict attorneys make an individualized determination whether\n\na conviction warrants burdening the court system with the\n\nadjudication of a motion for a new trial, CPCS with the\n\nassignment of counsel for those who are indigent, and the\n\ntaxpayers with payment for the notice and for assigned counsel,\n\nespecially where a defendant has already served the entirety of\n\nthe sentence.   A substantial vetting of the relevant cases by\n\nthe district attorneys will allow our criminal justice system to\n\nfocus its limited resources where they are most needed, and\n\ndiminish the risk that the number of these cases will so\n\noverwhelm CPCS that the single justice will have to act to\n\nprotect the relevant Dookhan defendants' right to counsel.27\n\n\n     27\n       Our focus in the phase one protocol on whether the\nCommonwealth could obtain a drug conviction against the relevant\nDookhan defendants with evidence untainted by Dookhan's\nmisconduct is comparable to the approach taken by New Jersey\ncourts following revelations of misconduct by a police officer\nwho made numerous drunk driving arrests. In State v. Gookins,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1947734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1947734/state-v-gookins/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44-45 (1994), three defendants moved to vacate\ntheir guilty pleas for driving while under the influence of\nalcohol after the police officer involved in their arrests and\nthe administration of their breathalyzer tests was convicted of\nfalsifying the result of the breathalyzer test he had performed\non an undercover agent, and of stealing money from drivers whom\nhe had stopped. The defendants had pleaded guilty in reliance\non the results of their breathalyzer tests. Id. at 45. The New\nJersey Supreme Court vacated their convictions and issued an\norder requiring the prosecution to certify to the trial court\n\f                                                                   54\n\n\n     ii.   Phase two.   In the second phase of the protocol, no\n\nlater than thirty days after the expiration of the ninety-day\n\nperiod in phase one, new notice shall be provided to all\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants identified in the district\n\nattorneys' third letters.    The notice shall consist of a mailing\n\nthat is approved by the single justice as to its content, its\n\nenvelope, and its mode of delivery.28   The single justice shall\n\nalso have the authority to order additional forms of public\n\nnotice, such as through newspapers or social media, to enhance\n\nthe effectiveness of the mailing and to attempt to reach those\n\nwho might not receive it.\n\n\n\n\n\"all the evidence that it considers to be untainted that would\nsustain the prosecution of these cases, . . . excluding the\ntestimony of [the convicted officer].\" Id. at 51. The trial\ncourt was instructed to hold a hearing \"to determine whether\nsuch evidence is sufficient to permit the State to proceed with\nthe case.\" Id. at 52. In a separate class action in the United\nStates District Court, the State consented to the appointment of\na special master to review all drunk driving cases of class\nmembers involving the convicted officer and determine whether\nthose convictions should be reversed. Id. at 51. The special\nmaster conducted an individualized review of these cases and\ndetermined that \"the only evidence inculpating the [defendants]\ncame from a police officer known to be corrupt.\" See Dickerson\nvs. Kane, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 92-2528 (D.N.J. July 17, 1995).\nThe District Court judge adopted the findings of the special\nmaster and ordered the reversal of 151 drunk driving\nconvictions. Id.\n     28\n       We leave to the single justice the question whether\ncertified mail or some other comparable means of delivery is\nappropriate to determine whether the defendant actually receives\nthe notice.\n\f                                                                   55\n\n\n    The new notice shall not only address the deficiencies\n\ndescribed in the content of the first written notice sent by the\n\ndistrict attorneys, but also simplify the process for defendants\n\nto move for a new trial.   The notice should identify the\n\ntelephone number of a \"hotline\" staffed by CPCS, so that persons\n\nwho receive the notice can seek immediate guidance.   The mailing\n\nshould permit a relevant Dookhan defendant to declare, simply by\n\nchecking a box, that the defendant wishes to discuss with\n\ncounsel whether the defendant should attempt to vacate his or\n\nher drug conviction by filing a motion for a new trial, and\n\nshould also include a form indigency affidavit for the defendant\n\nto fill out if he or she claims to be indigent and therefore\n\nqualifies for the assignment of counsel.   CPCS is encouraged to\n\ndraft and include within the mailing a separate letter providing\n\nthe legal guidance and information that CPCS would generally\n\nprovide to a relevant Dookhan defendant who would telephone its\n\nhotline.   Because this guidance letter, unlike the notice,\n\nconstitutes legal advocacy and not simply legal information, and\n\nmight encourage relevant Dookhan defendants to move for a new\n\ntrial to eliminate the collateral consequences arising from\n\ntheir drug conviction, the content of this letter shall not\n\nrequire the approval of the single justice.   Along with the\n\nnotice, the guidance letter, the check-off sheet, and the form\n\nindigency affidavit, the mailing shall include a stamped, self-\n\f                                                                    56\n\n\naddressed envelope so that, once completed, the documents may be\n\nreturned to an address designated by the single justice.    Where\n\na relevant Dookhan defendant returns the documents indicating\n\nthat he or she is indigent and wishes to explore with counsel\n\nthe filing of a motion for a new trial, the single justice shall\n\nmake an indigency determination and, where indigency is found,\n\nshall order CPCS to assign counsel to the defendant.   No action\n\nshall be taken regarding any relevant Dookhan defendant's\n\nconviction where he or she does not return the documents or\n\notherwise move for a new trial.\n\n    The single justice shall also address the challenge created\n\nby the substantial number of relevant Dookhan defendants who\n\nhave yet to be successfully located.   As it stands now, these\n\ndefendants have yet to be informed that the substance at issue\n\nin their case was tested by Dookhan in the Hinton lab, that\n\nDookhan's misconduct over many years has been found to be\n\negregious government misconduct, and that they are entitled to\n\nthe conclusive presumption of egregious government misconduct if\n\nthey were to move for a new trial.   Because they have not yet\n\nbeen so informed, they effectively have been denied the\n\nopportunity to seek redress for this misconduct.\n\n    The district attorneys have an obligation to take all\n\nreasonable steps necessary to provide these individuals with\n\nnotice of Dookhan's misconduct, and that includes reasonable\n\f                                                                   57\n\n\nefforts to locate them, wherever they might be residing.     Where,\n\ndespite reasonable efforts, the district attorneys are unable to\n\nobtain an address for a relevant Dookhan defendant, or where the\n\nnotice is returned as undeliverable, the single justice shall\n\ndirect the relevant district attorney to locate the current\n\naddress of the defendant's last attorney of record in the case.\n\nThe notice and accompanying documents shall be sent to that\n\nattorney, with a cover letter asking the attorney to make best\n\nefforts to locate his or her former client so that effective\n\nnotice can be accomplished.   In addition, the single justice\n\nshall have the authority to direct the probation department to\n\ninclude a notation in the missing defendant's board of probation\n\nrecord indicating that the defendant is a relevant Dookhan\n\ndefendant, so that the defendant can receive the required notice\n\nand related documents if he or she returns to court.   For the\n\nrelevant Dookhan defendants who cannot otherwise be located, the\n\nsingle justice shall also have the authority to order the use of\n\nsocial or other media to provide the notice and related\n\ndocuments, or information regarding them.\n\n    The financial burden of notifying defendants of egregious\n\ngovernment misconduct that affected their criminal cases must be\n\nborne by the prosecuting district attorney's office, even if, as\n\nhere, the fault belongs to the Hinton lab and Dookhan, not the\n\nprosecutors.   Therefore, the cost of providing new and adequate\n\f                                                                    58\n\n\nnotice, including but not limited to the cost of mailing, of\n\nlocating missing defendants, and of publicity through social and\n\nother media, shall be borne by the district attorneys, with the\n\nallocation of those costs to be determined by the single\n\njustice.   We recognize that this cost could be considerable, but\n\nthat is a consequence of egregious government misconduct that\n\naffected more than 20,000 defendants.   We also note that a\n\ndistrict attorney may reduce the amount of this cost by reducing\n\nthe number of defendants identified in the third letter.      The\n\nfailure of a district attorney to bear the district's\n\nproportionate share of these costs shall be deemed equivalent to\n\na failure to provide defendants with exculpatory information,\n\nwith the sanctions appropriate to such a failure.\n\n    iii.   Phase three.   In the third phase, CPCS shall identify\n\nin writing to the single justice all cases, if any, where CPCS\n\nreceived an order for the assignment of counsel, but was unable\n\nwithin sixty days of the order to assign counsel despite CPCS's\n\nbest efforts.   The single justice shall then make a factual\n\nfinding, after hearing, whether CPCS has made best efforts to\n\nassign counsel in these cases.   In those cases where the single\n\njustice makes such a finding, the single justice shall issue an\n\norder to show cause why the drug conviction of this\n\nunrepresented defendant should not be vacated, and set a date\n\nfor a show cause hearing where the Commonwealth will have an\n\f                                                                  59\n\n\nopportunity to be heard.   At or after that hearing, if the\n\nsingle justice determines that relevant Dookhan defendants have\n\nbeen denied their right to counsel because of the inability of\n\nCPCS, despite its best efforts, to assign counsel to represent\n\nthe defendants, the single justice may order that the drug\n\nconvictions at issue be vacated and dismissed without prejudice,\n\nunless the interests of justice otherwise dictate.29   See\n\nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 246.\n\n     Conclusion.   The case is remanded to the single justice for\n\nthe entry of a declaratory judgment as provided in this opinion\n\nand for further action consistent with this opinion.30\n\n                                    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     29\n       We recognize our authority to appoint a special master to\nassist the single justice in his or her exercise of our\nsuperintendence authority in these cases. See S.J.C. Rule 2:13,\nas appearing in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981).\n     30\n       Because we recognize the challenges involved in\nimplementing the three-phase protocol, the single justice is\nauthorized to make necessary revisions if any part of it is\ndetermined to be impracticable. In addition, if this protocol\nfor any reason were to prove inadequate in practice to remedy\nthe wrong despite the best efforts of the parties, the single\njustice may issue a new reservation and report to the full\ncourt.\n\f     LENK, J. (concurring, with whom Budd, J., joins).     It has\n\nbeen over five years since the stunning misconduct of a rogue\n\nchemist at the State's William A. Hinton State Laboratory\n\nInstitute (Hinton lab) first came to light.   The nature, scope,\n\nand adverse consequences of that misconduct on the individuals\n\ndirectly affected, on our system of justice, and on the\n\ntaxpayers who must foot the bill for this lamentable turn of\n\nevents are all ably recounted in the court's opinion, as well as\n\nin the dissenting opinion.   I write separately to underscore\n\nthat, in those five years, and despite the time and efforts of so\n\nmany, we have managed to address fewer than 2,000 of the\n\nestimated 20,000 or more cases involving Annie Dookhan-tainted\n\nevidence.   We cannot go on this way.\n\n     Even as we speak, the myriad ripple effects of one woman's\n\nmisdeeds continue to afflict the relevant Dookhan defendants,\n\nthousands and thousands of whom already have served their time\n\nfor convictions that we now know to be suspect.   As a result of\n\nhaving a prior drug conviction, many of those same people, some\n\nof whom may not even know to this day of Dookhan's fateful role\n\nin their lives, may now find themselves unable to get work or\n\nhousing, obtain or keep needed professional and drivers'\n\nlicenses, attend college, receive government benefits, or even\n\nstay in this country.   Mindful of this, I share the dissenting\n\nJustice's frustration with the unacceptably glacial systemic\n\f                                                                   2\n\n\nresponse to date and join in her view that extraordinary measures\n\nare now in order.   For reasons explained in the court's opinion,\n\nhowever, I regard the protocol announced today (Bridgeman II\n\nprotocol) as promising to be such a measure, but only if\n\nimplemented in a manner that countenances no further delays.    For\n\nthe protocol to achieve its goals and end this \"blight on the\n\nintegrity of our criminal justice system,\" post at   , there must\n\nbe strict compliance with its stringent timelines and\n\nrequirements.   Only this will forestall the need for a\n\n\"Bridgeman III\" and different measures.\n\n     While blame for the difficult situation in which we find\n\nourselves lies solely with Dookhan and the Hinton lab that\n\nallowed it to happen -- and it cannot be said too many times that\n\nfault most certainly does not lie with the prosecutors who,\n\nwithout knowing its tainted provenance, in good faith used the\n\nevidence Dookhan created -- we consistently have recognized that\n\nher misdeeds must be attributed to the government, and that the\n\ngovernment must bear the responsibility to put things right.\n\nJust as the success of the Bridgeman II protocol will depend on\n\nits timely and rigorous implementation, so too will its viability\n\nturn, at least initially, on the willingness of the district\n\nattorneys promptly to dismiss with prejudice a truly significant\n\nnumber of the roughly 20,000 relevant Dookhan defendants'\n\ncases -- at a minimum, those for simple possession in which\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\nsentences already have been served.     See ante at note 24.   Not\n\ndoing so in the first phase of the protocol will of necessity add\n\nto the already staggering human and financial costs of the\n\nscandal and risk overloading the already strained public defense\n\nsystem.   In this regard, we cannot turn a blind eye to the\n\npotential costs of the looming crisis of thus far undetermined\n\nmagnitude caused in western Massachusetts by Sonja Farak, yet\n\nanother rogue chemist employed by a State laboratory.    And, as to\n\nthe presumably limited number of remaining cases that the\n\ndistrict attorneys decline to dismiss, truly informative notice\n\nto the defendants involved, using whatever modes of communication\n\nwill be effective, is vital to achieving the fair and workable\n\noutcome contemplated by the protocol.\n\n     Recognizing what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once called\n\n\"the fierce urgency of now,\" we must act swiftly and surely to\n\nstaunch the damage and to make things as right as we can.      The\n\nBridgeman II protocol draws upon the deep roots of our\n\njurisprudence to craft a response that, consistent with\n\nfundamental principles, will bring this deplorable episode\n\nforthwith to a just resolution once and for all.     May it be so.\n\f     HINES, J. (dissenting).   The petitioners and intervener\n\n(collectively, petitioners) are before this court once again\n\nseeking a global remedy for the more than 20,000 defendants\n\nwhose convictions were tainted by Annie Dookhan’s unprecedented1\n\nand far-reaching misconduct at the William A. Hinton State\n\nLaboratory Institute.    The court rejects a global remedy,\n\nadopting the view that \"despite its considerable risks and\n\nburdens, case-by-case adjudication is the fairest and best\n\nalternative to resolve the cases potentially tainted by\n\nDookhan's misconduct.\"    Ante at    .   I disagree.   Now, more\n\nthan five years after Dookhan's misconduct first came to light,\n\nthe need to adopt a swift and sure remedy for the harm caused by\n\nher deceit presents itself with palpable urgency.      The time has\n\ncome to close the book on this scandal, once and for all, by\n\nadopting a global remedy.    While I agree, as the court notes,\n\nthat a global remedy is \"strong medicine,\" ante at        , the\n\ncontinuing violation of the rights of the defendants affected by\n\nDookhan's misconduct and the damage to the integrity of our\n\ncriminal justice system demand no less.\n\n     Contrary to the court's assessment of the case-by-case\n\nprocedure offered as the solution to the problem the court is\n\nobliged to solve, it is neither the fairest nor the best\n\n     1\n       An exhaustive search of reported cases yielded not a\nsingle case involving misconduct comparable to that committed by\nDookhan.\n\f                                                                     2\n\n\nalternative for remedying the manifest injustice to the\n\ndefendants caught up in the Dookhan scandal and for restoring\n\nthe integrity to our criminal justice system.    It fails as the\n\n\"fairest\" alternative because it flouts the guiding principle\n\nthat \"in the wake of government misconduct that has cast a\n\nshadow over the entire criminal justice system, it is most\n\nappropriate that the benefit of the remedy inure to the\n\ndefendants.\"    Commonwealth v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (2014),\n\nciting Lavallee v.

It also fails as the \"best\" alternative\n\nbecause it is simply unworkable as a timely and effective\n\nmechanism for addressing the due process claims of the thousands\n\nof defendants now deemed to have been convicted on Dookhan's\n\ntainted evidence.     In short, the court's solution is too little\n\nand too late.    The only fitting end to this blight on the\n\nintegrity of our criminal justice system is vacatur and\n\ndismissal with prejudice of the convictions of all relevant\n\nDookhan defendants.    Therefore, I dissent.\n\n     The case for a global remedy.      We have been here before.\n\nWe acknowledged in Scott, 467 Mass. at 352, that Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct caused \"a lapse of systemic magnitude in the criminal\n\njustice system.\"    Recognizing the \"particularly insidious\"\n\nnature of Dookhan's misconduct and that it \"belies\n\nreconstruction,\" we adopted a conclusive presumption of\n\f                                                                         3\n\n\negregious government misconduct as an accommodation to those\n\ndefendants able to establish Dookhan's role in producing the\n\nevidence upon which their conviction was based.         Id.   Later in\n\nBridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">465</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015) (Bridgeman I), we declined the invitation to\n\nimplement a global remedy for the thousands of cases affected by\n\nDookhan's misconduct \"at this time.\"      Id. at 487.    Signaling a\n\npreference for a measured approach rather than the more drastic\n\nglobal remedy advocated by the petitioners, we noted that \"our\n\ndecisions in Scott and [Commonwealth v. Charles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2013)], have provided Dookhan defendants . . . with meaningful\n\nsolutions for addressing concerns that have arisen as these\n\ndefendants attempt to challenge their drug convictions.\"          Id.\n\n     Since Bridgeman I, however, Scott's promise as a hedge\n\nagainst the wholesale violation of the due process rights of\n\nthis class of defendants has been undermined by the sheer\n\nmagnitude of the problem.      Scott was decided without the benefit\n\nof the investigative reports establishing the scope of Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct.2    The court reasonably assumed, therefore, that the\n\njurisprudential shortcut to proving Dookhan's misconduct would\n\nmake a case-by-case approach workable.     Because we now know the\n\nextent of Dookhan's misconduct and that it has not yet been\n\nmitigated in any significant respect by the measures in Scott\n\n     2\n         See ante at note 6.\n\f                                                                      4\n\n\nand Charles, that assumption is no longer valid.   With a clearer\n\neye on the scope of the problem, Scott's characterization of\n\nDookhan's misconduct as a \"lapse of systemic magnitude\" still\n\nstands as an apt factual and legal context for the petitioners'\n\nclaims.   Scott, 467 Mass. at 352.\n\n     In this case, as in Scott, we are called upon to \"exercise\n\nour superintendence power [under G. L. c. 211, § 3,] to fashion\n\na workable approach to motions to withdraw a guilty plea brought\n\nby defendants affected by [Dookhan's] misconduct.\"   Id.    In this\n\nundertaking, the appropriate analytical framework is that\n\narticulated in Scott.3   We noted that in fashioning a remedy for\n\nthe \"systemic lapse\" caused by Dookhan's misconduct, \"[w]e must\n\naccount for the due process rights of defendants, the integrity\n\nof the criminal justice system, the efficient administration of\n\njustice in responding to such potentially broad-ranging\n\nmisconduct, and the myriad public interests at stake.\"     Id.   In\n\n\n     3\n       Without clearly explaining why, the court strays from the\nanalytical framework we adopted in Scott, relying instead on a\nself-selected set of \"principles\" explained in elaborate detail.\nAnte at    . I agree that these principles are firmly rooted in\nour jurisprudence, but they are not necessarily dispositive of\nthe issue presented here. Absent a reason to play by a\ndifferent set of rules from that articulated in Scott, 467 Mass.\nat 352, and reiterated in Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 487, as an\nappropriate standard to apply in \"fashion[ing] a workable\napproach\" to handling the cases in which Dookhan was the primary\nor confirmatory chemist, I would not spurn the analytical\napproach adopted in Scott. The problem here is the same as it\nwas in Scott: the need to craft a fair and timely approach to\nthe resolution of these cases.\n\f                                                                        5\n\n\nbalancing these factors as discussed below, I am persuaded that\n\nthe case for a global remedy as advocated by the petitioners is\n\ncompelling.\n\n       1.    Due process rights.   The due process rights at stake\n\nhere, \"the opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in\n\na meaningful manner'\" (citation omitted), Bridgeman I, 471 Mass.\n\nat 479, weigh heavily in Scott's remedial calculus for two\n\nreasons:       the serious and ongoing collateral consequences to the\n\nclass of defendants convicted on the strength of Dookhan's\n\ntainted evidence; and the necessity to avoid unnecessary delay\n\nbeyond the four years that already have elapsed in providing\n\nthese defendants a \"meaningful\" opportunity to establish\n\nprejudice from Dookhan's misconduct.       The court, ante at, paints\n\na grim picture of how lives are upended by the serious\n\ncollateral consequences of drug-related convictions.       The\n\npicture is even more grim when one considers that many, if not\n\nmost, of these defendants have already served their sentences.4\n\nThey have paid their debt to society whether they owed one or\n\nnot.       The years spent incarcerated cannot be restored to these\n\n       4\n       An analysis conducted by a data science fellow at the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts found\nthat approximately sixty-two per cent of the convictions in the\ncases tainted by Dookhan's misconduct were for possession only\nand that about ninety-one per cent of these cases were resolved\nin the District Court. These statistics support the assumption\nthat most defendants have completed their sentences.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\ndefendants, but a fair and just resolution can make amends.\n\nWhat due process requires then is a remedy that is simple, sure,\n\nand final.   That means a remedy that is uncomplicated by the\n\nmyriad moving parts built into the court's case-by-case model,\n\nfree of the risk that further delay will prolong the only relief\n\nthat realistically can be offered to defendants who have already\n\nserved their sentences.   This interpretation of what due process\n\nrequires at this point in the effort to solve the Dookhan\n\nproblem is supported by Scott and Bridgeman I.\n\n     In Bridgeman I, 471 Mass. at 479, the court declined to\n\nadopt a global remedy in part based on the \"substantial efforts\n\nthat are being made to deal with the impact of Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct.\"    With at least the prospect of a speedy resolution\n\nof the cases in which Dookhan was the primary or confirmatory\n\nchemist, the court was content to delay a more robust remedy to\n\nallow those efforts to accomplish their purpose.5   Id. at 487.\n\nHere, however, we have come to an end point in assessing the\n\nimpact of Scott and Charles in resolving the outstanding cases\n\nof this type.   The district attorneys have identified 24,000\n\ncases, more or less, that must be adjudicated on the prejudice\n\nprong of Scott.   Thus, the scope of the current challenge is\n\n\n     5\n       The court observed that \"[o]ur decision . . . will go a\nlong way in resolving additional concerns that have surfaced and\nin moving these cases forward towards resolution.\" Bridgeman I,\n471 Mass. at 487.\n\f                                                                     7\n\n\nclear.    The remedy, in accounting for defendants' due process\n\nright to a prompt hearing, must have some reasonable prospect\n\nfor immediate resolution of the 24,000 cases to avoid\n\nexacerbating the serious consequences of delay.    I am not\n\npersuaded that the court's case-by-case model meets this test in\n\ncircumstances where the defendants' due process rights are\n\nparamount.\n\n     2.   Integrity of the criminal justice system.   It is beyond\n\ndispute that Dookhan's misconduct, the details of which have\n\nspread beyond the legal community,6 has undermined public trust\n\nin the integrity of the criminal justice system.    In a case such\n\nas this, coming before the court as a consequence of Dookhan's\n\nserious corruption of our criminal justice system, the court's\n\ntask is not merely to decide the rights of the parties.       The\n\ncourt must also act, within the boundaries of the law, to\n\nrestore the public's faith in the integrity of the courts.\n\nUnlike the right to counsel crisis in Lavallee, Dookhan's\n\nmisconduct is not a problem of the Legislature's making.      See\n\nLavallee, 442 Mass. at 246.   The duty to protect, and restore\n\nwhen necessary, the integrity of the criminal justice system\n\nfalls squarely upon the court.\n\n     With no clear sign from the court that it grasps the scope\n\n     6\n       See, e.g., Jackman, When a State's Drug Chemist Lies for\nYears, Should All Her Cases Be Thrown Out?, Wash. Post, Sept.\n29, 2016.\n\f                                                                    8\n\n\nof the damage and the need for an approach that will eliminate\n\n\"root and branch\"7 all of the attendant consequences, the public\n\nis left to wonder if the process by which a court imposes the\n\nsanction of a loss of liberty is fair and just.8   Restoring the\n\nintegrity of the criminal justice system requires that the court\n\nacknowledge and make amends for the shortcomings in a system\n\nthat permitted Dookhan to \"go rogue\" for so long without\n\ndetection.9   Those shortcomings call into question the integrity\n\nof the entire criminal justice apparatus for gathering and\n\nreporting the evidence that juries rely on in deciding a\n\ndefendant's guilt or innocence.   The perceived legitimacy of\n\ncourt-imposed restraints on a defendant's liberty rises or falls\n\non the integrity of the evidence.   If the mistrust engendered by\n\nthe individual and institutional failures that produced this\n\nscandal is allowed to remain, it will have far-reaching adverse\n\n\n     7\n       See Green v. County Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437-438\n(1968)(using phrase to describe obligation to dismantle school\nsegregation fourteen years after command to do so in Brown v.\nBoard of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [1954]).\n     8\n       Over the years, the racial impact of our sentencing\npractices have come under scrutiny. See e.g., The Sentencing\nProject, The Color of Justice: Racial and Ethnic Disparity in\nState Prisons, at 3, 5, 7-8 & n.13, 16-18 (2016). Although\nracial bias has not been documented, members of the public,\nespecially those in the communities of color, rarely parse such\nreports in search of the real reason for disparate impact.\n     9\n       \"Dookhan's consistently high testing volumes should have\nbeen a clear indication that a more thorough analysis and review\nof her work was needed.\" See Scott, 467 Mass. at 340.\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nconsequences for the ability of our courts to maintain the\n\npublic's faith in the promise of equal justice for all.   Because\n\nI am not persuaded that the case-by-case model adopted by the\n\ncourt can accomplish this essential purpose, this factor weighs\n\nin favor of the global remedy advocated by the petitioners.\n\n    3.   Efficient administration of justice.   There is no\n\nquestion that, despite the best efforts of the parties,\n\nthousands of defendants affected by Dookhan's misconduct still\n\nlanguish without notice of their rights or even a realistic\n\nopportunity for redress.   The four-year delay in the resolution\n\nof the cases tainted by Dookhan's misconduct, as discussed\n\nabove, adequately makes the point that the administration of\n\njustice has been anything but efficient.   Yet, the court gives\n\ninsufficient weight to this factor in adopting a case-by-case\n\nadjudication model.\n\n    The efficacy of the court's case-by-case model is at best\n\nquestionable, both because it is unworkable and because it is\n\nlikely to perpetuate further delay in providing a remedy to the\n\nthousands of defendants affected by Dookhan's misconduct.     Not\n\nonly is it lacking in the ability to insure a speedy resolution\n\nof the 24,000 cases thus tainted, it is vulnerable to failure\n\nfor several practical reasons:   the reliance on voluntary\n\ncooperation of the district attorneys, and unrealistic\n\ntimetables.\n\f                                                                       10\n\n\n    First, the success of phase one, which anticipates a\n\nsubstantial culling of the 24,000 cases, depends entirely on the\n\nvoluntary cooperation of the district attorneys.     Ante at       .\n\nUnderstandably, the court has not asserted any authority to\n\ncompel the dismissal of cases.    See Commonwealth v. Pellegrini,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2105912\"><a href=\"/opinion/2105912/commonwealth-v-pellegrini/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (1993) (\"Prosecutors have broad discretion in\n\ndetermining whether to prosecute a case\").     In this respect, the\n\ncourt's model does not change the status quo:    the district\n\nattorneys already have, and have had for the duration of the\n\nDookhan crisis, the sole authority voluntarily to dismiss these\n\ncases.   It is undisputed that the district attorneys have\n\ncooperated in identifying the defendants presumed to have been\n\naffected by Dookhan's misconduct.    However, without some basis\n\nfor a reasonable belief that the district attorneys will follow\n\nthrough on the suggestion to dismiss thousands of cases with\n\nprejudice, the court does not inspire confidence in the success\n\nof the model.\n\n    Second, the timetable for the accomplishment of the various\n\nphases of the case-by-case model is unrealistic and\n\nunachievable.   The court acknowledges that \"substantial vetting\"\n\nis required under phase one.     Ante at   .   Yet, the district\n\nattorneys are given only ninety days to sift through the 24,000\n\ncases that have been connected to Dookhan's misconduct.    If past\n\nis prologue, and taking into account the delays in getting to\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\nwhere we are now, accomplishing this task within the ninety-day\n\nwindow adopted for the court's model is highly unlikely.\n\nLikewise, the thirty-day deadline in phase two for notice to the\n\ndefendants whose cases will not be dismissed without prejudice\n\nis problematic for the same reason.    To the extent that the time\n\nframes reflect a calculation that absolute compliance by the\n\ndistrict attorneys and the Committee for Public Counsel Services\n\nwill adequately accommodate the defendants' due process rights,\n\nI have no confidence that the court's faith in the practicality\n\nof the process will be rewarded.   Unless the court is prepared\n\nto declare that reasonable requests for delay, even those based\n\non the impracticality of the timetable, will be denied, the more\n\nlikely scenario is that further indeterminable delay will occur.\n\n    With the defendants' due process right to a prompt hearing\n\nhanging in the balance, I cannot accept an untimely, and\n\nultimately unworkable, case-by-case model as an appropriate\n\nresolution of the issue before us.\n\n    4.   Other public interests.     None of the other public\n\ninterests at stake here warrants a disposition that prolongs a\n\nglobal remedy for the defendants who are presumed to have been\n\nvictims of Dookhan's misconduct.   First, the likelihood that the\n\nvast majority of the defendants in the cases in which Dookhan\n\nwas the primary or confirmatory chemist have completed their\n\nsentences mitigates the most compelling public interest at stake\n\f                                                                    12\n\n\nhere:   public safety.   On the other side of the ledger, the\n\nserious and enduring collateral consequences of these\n\nconvictions remain extant, resulting in manifest injustice to\n\nthose defendants.   The court weighs the rights of the defendants\n\n\"against the necessity for preserving society's interest in the\n\nadministration of justice\" and concludes that this factor favors\n\nthe Commonwealth.   Ante at      , quoting Commonwealth v. Cronk,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2064802\"><a href=\"/opinion/2064802/commonwealth-v-cronk/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198-199 (1985).    In my view, this calculation is\n\ndemonstrably erroneous.    Society's interest in the\n\nadministration of justice is hardly served by a remedy that\n\ndefers to the Commonwealth in deciding which, if any, cases are\n\nto be dismissed with prejudice and, in all other respects,\n\ndepends on the defendants to opt into the scheme to benefit from\n\nthe possibility that the case will be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nAnte at.\n\n    In sum, the Scott factors weigh heavily in favor of the\n\ndefendants in the cases tainted by Dookhan's misconduct.     The\n\nscope and egregiousness of that misconduct, combined with the\n\nfour-year delay in providing relief to the defendants affected\n\nby it, compels a global remedy.    It is difficult to imagine a\n\nscenario where, faced with the detritus from a scandal of\n\nsimilar magnitude, a court would hesitate to order a global\n\f                                                              13\n\n\nremedy.   The question comes to mind, \"If not now, when?\"10\n\n\n\n\n    10\n       C. Taylor, Sayings of the Jewish Fathers 7 (2d ed. 1897)\n(quoting Hillel the Elder).\n\f</pre>",
