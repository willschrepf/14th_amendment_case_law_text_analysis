We reverse and remand.\n\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n     This appeal raises a single question: Does the evidence\n\noffered by the city of Kennedale sufficiently support its ordinance\n\fregulating sexually oriented businesses?\n\n     In   1999,    Kennedale      annexed    land   that     included      multiple\n\nsexually oriented businesses, thereby subjecting those businesses\n\nto the city’s ordinances. The ordinances prohibit the operation of\n\nsexually oriented businesses within 800 feet of churches, schools,\n\nresidences, day care centers, parks, and other sexually oriented\n\nbusinesses,   as    well     as   within     specified      overlay    districts.\n\nAdditionally, the ordinances require sexually oriented businesses\n\nto obtain a license to operate.              In justifying its ordinances,\n\nKennedale relied on (1) studies from nine other cities, (2) an\n\nopinion survey of land use appraisers conducted by the city’s\n\nattorney, and (3) citizen commentary from public meetings, all\n\nregarding   the    harmful    secondary      effects   of    sexually      oriented\n\nbusinesses on surrounding land uses.\n\n     Following      annexation,      the     ordinances      allowed       affected\n\nbusinesses three years to recoup their investments and relocate.\n\nFollowing   criticism      that    the   regulations       failed     to   leave   a\n\nsufficient number of alternative locations for already existing\n\nsexually oriented businesses, the city amended the ordinances to\n\nidentify specific parcels of land upon which sexually oriented\n\nbusinesses may locate.\n\n     Reliable Consultants, Inc., d/b/a “Dreamers” (hereinafter\n\n“Reliable”) is an off-site store, meaning that it sells video\n\ntapes, DVD’s, magazines, and other print materials, but that none\n\nof the materials can be viewed or consumed on the premises, and the\n\n                                         2\n\fstore offers no live entertainment, viewing booths, or theaters.1\n\n       After    finding   the    ordinances      were    content   neutral,   the\n\ndistrict court relied on Encore Videos, Inc. v. City of San\n\nAntonio, 330 F.3d 288 (5th Cir. 2003), to find that the City’s\n\nevidence of secondary effects failed to show that the ordinances\n\nwere       narrowly   tailored   to    further    a     substantial    government\n\ninterest.        The court declined to consider additional evidence\n\nKennedale offered, and granted Reliable’s motion for a permanent\n\ninjunction.       Kennedale appealed.\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review a district court’s summary judgment ruling and\n\nother legal issues de novo.           N.W. Enters. Inc. v. City of Houston,\n\n352 F.3d 162, 172 (5th Cir. 2003).            We review a district court’s\n\nfactual findings for clear error.             Kona Tech. Corp. v. S. Pac.\n\nTransp. Co., 225 F.3d 595, 601 (5th Cir. 2000).                       The Supreme\n\nCourt’s admonition that cities not justify ordinances by relying on\n\n“shoddy data or reasoning,” City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books,\n\n535 U.S. 425, 438 (2002) (plurality opinion), requires factual\n\nfindings, but turns on the legal interpretation of what the Supreme\n\nCourt meant by “shoddy.”         Therefore, we review a district court’s\n\nfindings as to the existence of a city’s evidence for clear error,\n\nbut we review de novo whether that evidence falls within the\n\n\n       1\n      Originally, there were five affected sexually oriented\nbusinesses/plaintiffs, but all but one settled during the course of\nlitigation, leaving Reliable as the lone plaintiff-appellee.\n\n                                         3\n\fSupreme Court’s admonition.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\n      “Zoning       regulations         restricting        the    location     of   adult\n\nentertainment businesses are considered time, place, and manner\n\nrestrictions    .     .   .   if   they       do    not   ban    [adult-entertainment]\n\nbusinesses throughout the whole of a jurisdiction and are ‘designed\n\nto combat the undesirable secondary effects of such businesses’\n\nrather than to restrict the content of their speech per se.”\n\nEncore Videos, 330 F.3d at 291 (quoting City of Renton v. Playtime\n\nTheaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 49 (1986)) (citing Lakeland Lounge v.\n\nJackson, 973 F.2d 1255, 1257–58 (5th Cir. 1992)).                     Time, place, and\n\nmanner restrictions on speech violate the First Amendment unless\n\nthey are content-neutral, are designed to serve a substantial\n\ngovernmental        interest,      do    not       unreasonably     limit    alternative\n\navenues of communication, and are narrowly tailored.                         See Encore\n\nVideos, 330 F.3d at 291–92.\n\n      Kennedale’s ordinances meet the narrow tailoring standard if\n\nthey “target[] and eliminate[] no more than the exact source of the\n\nevil [they] seek[] to remedy.”                     Encore Videos, 330 F.3d at 293;\n\nFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485 (1988).                       Thus, an ordinance\n\nmeant to deter property depreciation may only regulate businesses\n\nfor   which     a     connection         to    property         depreciation    can   be\n\ndemonstrated.\n\n      To show that an ordinance advances its goals, a city “may rely\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fon any evidence that is ‘reasonably believed to be relevant.’”\n\nAlameda Books, 535 U.S. at 438.               However, “[t]his is not to say\n\nthat a municipality can get away with shoddy data or reasoning.\n\nThe municipality’s evidence must fairly support the municipality’s\n\nrationale for its ordinance.”            Id. at 438.2\n\n      On-site businesses (i.e., adult theaters or strip clubs) pose\n\na greater threat of secondary effects than off-site sexually\n\noriented businesses (i.e., adult bookstores).3                Therefore, a city\n\nthat enforces an ordinance meant to prevent harmful secondary\n\neffects associated with the operation of an off-site business must\n\nrely on evidence showing that off-site businesses, rather than the\n\nbroader category of sexually oriented businesses that includes on-\n\nsite businesses, cause harmful secondary effects.                  Encore Videos,\n\n330   F.3d   at    295   (requiring      city     to   “provide    at   least    some\n\nsubstantial       evidence      of   secondary    effects   specific      to    adult\n\nbusinesses    that       sell    books   or      videos   solely    for   off-site\n\nentertainment” to meet narrow tailoring requirement).\n\n      In Encore Videos, we invalidated San Antonio’s ordinance\n\n\n      2\n      Though this was a plurality opinion, a review of the\nconcurrences and dissent demonstrates that the Court would\nunanimously support this admonishment.\n      3\n      See Encore Videos, 330 F.3d at 295 (“Off-site businesses\ndiffer from on-site ones, because it is only reasonable to assume\nthat the former are less likely to create harmful secondary\neffects. If consumers of pornography cannot view the materials at\nthe sexually oriented establishment, they are less likely to linger\nin the area and engage in public alcohol consumption and other\nundesirable activities.”)\n\n                                          5\n\fregulating sexually oriented businesses because the city failed to\n\npresent adequate evidence showing a connection between off-site\n\nbusinesses and harmful secondary effects.           San Antonio’s evidence\n\nconsisted of three studies conducted in other cities showing a\n\nconnection between sexually oriented businesses, without isolating\n\noff-site businesses and secondary effects. Encore Videos, 330 F.3d\n\nat 294–95. Those studies did not provide any information exclusive\n\nto off-site businesses, so a substantial portion of the ordinance’s\n\nburden on speech did not serve to advance its goals, and it failed\n\nthe narrow tailoring prong.         Id. at 295.\n\n     This case differs from Encore Videos because Kennedale, unlike\n\nSan Antonio, offers evidence that purports to show a connection\n\nbetween purely off-site businesses, or “bookstores,” and harmful\n\nsecondary effects.     To determine whether the ordinance at issue is\n\nnarrowly   tailored,    we   must   determine     whether    Kennedale   could\n\nreasonably believe that the evidence is relevant to show the\n\nrequisite connection to harmful secondary effects.             Alameda Books,\n\n535 U.S. at 438.       In other words, we ask whether that evidence\n\n“fairly support[s] the [city’s] rationale for its ordinance.”              Id.\n\nApplying   our    holding    from    Encore   Videos,       Kennedale    cannot\n\nreasonably believe its evidence is relevant unless it sufficiently\n\nsegregates data attributable to off-site establishments from the\n\ndata attributable to on-site establishments.            Encore Videos, 330\n\nF.3d at 294–95.\n\n\n                                       6\n\f     Kennedale’s evidence consisted of studies from nine cities, as\n\nwell as an opinion survey of land use appraisers conducted by the\n\ncity’s attorney, and citizen commentary from public meetings.\n\nSeven of    Kennedale’s    nine   studies    from     other    cities   fail   to\n\ndifferentiate between on-site and off-site businesses.                  The 1984\n\nIndianapolis and 1986 Oklahoma City studies, however, included\n\nsurveys of real estate appraisers that focused strictly on “adult\n\nbookstores.”    The overwhelming majority of survey respondents in\n\nboth studies predicted that the presence of an adult bookstore\n\nwould negatively affect real estate value in the surrounding area.\n\nThe Indianapolis survey, conducted by the City of Indianapolis in\n\nconjunction with Indiana University School of Business, Division of\n\nResearch, polled 20% of the national membership of the American\n\nInstitute of Real Estate Appraisers.4               Eighty percent of the\n\nrespondents predicted that an adult bookstore would negatively\n\nimpact   residential     property    values,    and     seventy-two      percent\n\nbelieved    commercial    property   value     would    also    be   negatively\n\neffected.    The Oklahoma City study, which surveyed one hundred\n\nOklahoma City real estate appraisers, produced similar results:\n\nSeventy-four percent predicted a negative impact on real estate\n\nvalue in the surrounding area.\n\n     Appellee Reliable argues that the term “bookstore,” used in\n\nboth surveys, is a term of art and does not sufficiently specify\n\n\n     4\n      In the Indianapolis study, 1527 questionnaires were mailed,\nand 507 (33%) were returned.\n\n                                      7\n\foff-site premises.      They argue instead that adult bookstores often\n\ninclude   peep    shows,    arcades,       and     other    forms   of   on-site\n\nentertainment, rendering them on-site establishments. However, the\n\nSupreme   Court   has    previously        used    the   term   “bookstore”    as\n\ndistinguishable from “adult video arcades.”                 Alameda Books, 535\n\nU.S. at 442 (discussing city’s prohibition on “combination of adult\n\nbookstores and arcades”).      This was a survey sent to and completed\n\nby real estate appraisers, and so what matters is how those\n\nappraisers would have understood the survey’s reference to an adult\n\nbookstore.\n\n     Standing alone, it is reasonable to infer that the survey\n\nrespondents   interpreted    “bookstore”          as   signifying   an   off-site\n\nestablishment.     Webster’s Dictionary defines “bookstore” as “a\n\nplace of business where books are the chief stock in trade.”\n\nWEBSTER’S NEW INT’L DICTIONARY 253 (3d ed. 1981).          There is no reason to\n\nexpect that simply adding the word “adult” to the term would\n\ncompletely transform the nature of the business activity described.\n\nMoreover, the Indianapolis survey also asked respondents to explain\n\ntheir prediction that an adult bookstore would negatively impact\n\nproperty value: 29% believed such an establishment would attract\n\n“undesirables” to the neighborhood, 14% felt it would create a bad\n\nimage of the area, and 15% felt that it offended prevailing\n\ncommunity attitudes.       These reasons are equally applicable to an\n\non-site or off-site establishment, and are distinguishable from the\n\nproblems we have found to be unique to on-site businesses.                    See\n\n                                       8\n\fEncore Videos, 330 F.3d at 295 (“If consumers of pornography cannot\n\nview the materials at the sexually oriented establishment, they are\n\nless likely to linger in the area and engage in public alcohol\n\nconsumption . . . .”).       It is reasonable for Kennedale to believe\n\nthat the appraisers responding to the survey understood the term\n\n“adult    bookstore”   to    mean   off-site     businesses,    such   as   that\n\noperated by the plaintiff-appellee.\n\n     Kennedale’s ordinances purport to protect against harmful\n\nsecondary effects.         The Indianapolis and Oklahoma City studies\n\nsupport the belief that off-site sexually oriented businesses cause\n\nharmful secondary effects to the surrounding area in the form of\n\ndecreased property value.           So long as they are not relying on\n\nshoddy data or reasoning, we afford substantial deference to cities\n\nwith regards to the ordinances they enact.           See Alameda Books, 535\n\nU.S. at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting that “a city must\n\nhave latitude to experiment” and “courts should not be in the\n\nbusiness of second-guessing fact-bound empirical assessments of\n\ncity planners”).       The Indianapolis survey, in particular, was\n\ndrafted    by   experts,    pretested,     and   administered    to    a   large,\n\nnational pool of respondents.         It is not “shoddy.”        We therefore\n\nfind that Kennedale has produced evidence that it could have\n\nreasonably believed was relevant, and thus could have properly\n\nrelied upon.      The ordinances are narrowly tailored to advance a\n\nsubstantial governmental interest.\n\n     The other evidence produced by Kennedale to justify its\n\n                                       9\n\fordinance — an opinion survey of land use appraisers conducted by\n\nthe city’s attorney, and citizen commentary from public meetings —\n\nhas also been hotly debated by the parties.                   Given our findings\n\nabove,    however,    we    need    not   reach   that      additional    evidence.\n\nSimilarly, our finding moots the question of whether the district\n\ncourt erred in excluding additional evidence of secondary effects.\n\n     By finding that Kennedale’s ordinances were not narrowly\n\ntailored, the district court never reached the final element of the\n\ntime,     place,    and    manner     analysis:       whether     the    ordinances\n\nunreasonably       limit   alternative      avenues    of    communication.       We\n\ntherefore remand this case to the district court to make those\n\nfindings.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s\n\nsummary    judgment    and    remand      for   findings     as   to    whether   the\n\nordinances     leave       open    sufficient      alternative         channels    of\n\ncommunication.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f",

San Antonio's evidence consisted of three studies conducted in other cities showing a connection between sexually oriented businesses, without isolating off-site businesses and secondary effects. <i>Encore Videos,</i> 330 F.3d at 294-95. Those studies did not provide any information exclusive to off-site businesses, so a substantial portion of the ordinance's burden on speech did not serve to advance its goals, and it failed the narrow tailoring prong. <i>Id.</i> at 295.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case differs from <i>Encore Videos</i> because Kennedale, unlike San Antonio, offers evidence that purports to show a connection between purely off-site businesses, or \"bookstores,\" and harmful secondary effects. To determine whether the ordinance at issue is narrowly tailored, we must determine whether Kennedale could reasonably believe that the evidence is relevant to show the requisite connection to harmful secondary effects. <i>Alameda Books,</i> 535 U.S. at 438, 122 S.Ct. 1728. In other words, we ask whether that evidence \"fairly support[s] the [city's] rationale for its ordinance.\" <i>Id.</i> Applying our holding from <i>Encore Videos,</i> Kennedale cannot reasonably believe its evidence is relevant unless it sufficiently segregates data attributable to off-site establishments from the data attributable to on-site establishments. <i>Encore Videos,</i> 330 F.3d at 294-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kennedale's evidence consisted of studies from nine cities, as well as an opinion survey of land use appraisers conducted by the city's attorney, and citizen commentary from public meetings. Seven of Kennedale's nine studies from other cities fail to differentiate between on-site and off-site businesses. The 1984 Indianapolis and 1986 Oklahoma City studies, however, included surveys of real estate appraisers that focused strictly on \"adult bookstores.\" The overwhelming majority of survey respondents in both studies predicted that the presence of an adult bookstore would negatively affect real estate value in the surrounding area. The Indianapolis survey, conducted by the City of Indianapolis in conjunction with Indiana University School of Business, Division of Research, polled 20% of the national membership of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Eighty percent of the respondents predicted that an adult bookstore would negatively impact residential property values, and seventy-two percent believed commercial property value would also be negatively effected. The Oklahoma City study, which surveyed one hundred Oklahoma City real estate appraisers, produced similar results: Seventy-four percent predicted a negative impact on real estate value in the surrounding area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee Reliable argues that the term \"bookstore,\" used in both surveys, is a term of art and does not sufficiently specify off-site premises. They argue instead that adult bookstores often include peep shows, arcades, and other forms of on-site entertainment, rendering them on-site establishments. However, the Supreme Court has previously used the term \"bookstore\" as distinguishable from \"adult video arcades.\" <i>Alameda Books,</i> 535 U.S. at 442, 122 S.Ct. 1728 (discussing city's prohibition on \"combination of adult bookstores and arcades\"). This was a survey sent to and completed by real estate appraisers, and so what matters is how those appraisers would have understood the survey's reference to an adult bookstore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Standing alone, it is reasonable to infer that the survey respondents interpreted \"bookstore\" as signifying an off-site establishment. Webster's Dictionary defines \"bookstore\" as \"a place of business where books are the chief stock in trade.\" WEBSTER'S NEW INT'L DICTIONARY 253 (3d ed.1981). There is no reason to expect that simply adding the word \"adult\" to the term would completely transform the nature of the business activity described. Moreover, the Indianapolis survey also asked respondents to explain their prediction that an adult bookstore would negatively impact property value: 29% believed such an establishment would attract \"undesirables\" to the neighborhood, 14% felt it would create a bad image of the area, and 15% felt that it offended prevailing community attitudes. These reasons are equally applicable to an on-site or off-site establishment, and are distinguishable from the problems we have found to be unique to on-site businesses. <i>See Encore Videos,</i> 330 F.3d at 295 (\"If consumers of pornography cannot view the materials at the sexually oriented establishment, they are less likely to linger in the area and engage in public alcohol consumption. . . .\"). It is reasonable for Kennedale to believe that the appraisers responding to the survey understood the term \"adult bookstore\" to mean off-site businesses, such as that operated by the plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kennedale's ordinances purport to protect against harmful secondary effects. The Indianapolis and Oklahoma City studies support the belief that off-site sexually oriented businesses cause harmful secondary effects to the surrounding area in the form of decreased property value. So long as they are not relying on shoddy data or reasoning, we afford substantial deference to cities with regards to the ordinances they enact. <i>See Alameda Books,</i> 535 U.S. at 451, 122 S.Ct. 1728 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting that \"a city must have latitude to experiment\" and \"courts should not be in the business of second-guessing fact-bound empirical assessments of city planners\"). The Indianapolis survey, in particular, was drafted by experts, pretested, and administered to a large, national pool of respondents. It is not \"shoddy.\" We therefore find that Kennedale has produced evidence that it could have reasonably believed was relevant, and thus could have properly relied upon. The ordinances are narrowly tailored to advance a substantial governmental interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other evidence produced by Kennedale to justify its ordinance&#8212;an opinion survey of land use appraisers conducted by the city's attorney, and citizen commentary from public meetings&#8212;has also been hotly debated by the parties. Given our findings above, however, we need not reach that additional evidence. Similarly, our finding moots the question of whether the district court erred in excluding additional evidence of secondary effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By finding that Kennedale's ordinances were not narrowly tailored, the district court never reached the final element of the time, place, and manner analysis: whether the ordinances unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.

Those studies did not provide any information exclusive to off-site businesses, so a substantial portion of the ordinance's burden on speech did not serve to advance its goals, and it failed the narrow tailoring prong. <i>Id.</i> at 295.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case differs from <i>Encore Videos</i> because Kennedale, unlike San Antonio, offers evidence that purports to show a connection between purely off-site businesses, or \"bookstores,\" and harmful secondary effects. To determine whether the ordinance at issue is narrowly tailored, we must determine whether Kennedale could reasonably believe that the evidence is relevant to show the requisite connection to harmful secondary effects. <i>Alameda Books,</i> 535 U.S. at 438, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118501\"><a href=\"/opinion/118501/los-angeles-v-alameda-books-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1728</span></a></span>. In other words, we ask whether that evidence \"fairly support[s] the [city's] rationale for its ordinance.\" <i>Id.</i> Applying our holding from <i>Encore Videos,</i> Kennedale cannot reasonably believe its evidence is relevant unless it sufficiently segregates data attributable to off-site establishments from the data attributable to on-site establishments. <i>Encore Videos,</i> 330 F.3d at 294-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kennedale's evidence consisted of studies from nine cities, as well as an opinion survey of land use appraisers conducted by the city's attorney, and citizen commentary from public meetings. Seven of Kennedale's nine studies from other cities fail to differentiate between on-site and off-site businesses. The 1984 Indianapolis and 1986 Oklahoma City studies, however, included surveys of real estate appraisers that focused strictly on \"adult bookstores.\" The overwhelming majority of survey respondents in both studies predicted that the presence of an adult bookstore would negatively affect real estate value in the surrounding area. The Indianapolis survey, conducted by the City of Indianapolis in conjunction with Indiana University School of Business, Division of Research, polled 20% of the national membership of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Eighty percent of the respondents predicted that an adult bookstore would negatively impact residential property values, and seventy-two percent believed commercial property value would also be negatively effected. The Oklahoma City study, which surveyed one hundred Oklahoma City real estate appraisers, produced similar results: Seventy-four percent predicted a negative impact on real estate value in the surrounding area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee Reliable argues that the term \"bookstore,\" used in both surveys, is a term of art and does not sufficiently specify off-site premises. They argue instead that adult bookstores often include peep shows, arcades, and other forms of on-site entertainment, rendering them on-site establishments. However, the Supreme Court has previously used the term \"bookstore\" as distinguishable from \"adult video arcades.\" <i>Alameda Books,</i> 535 U.S. at 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118501\"><a href=\"/opinion/118501/los-angeles-v-alameda-books-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1728</span></a></span> (discussing city's prohibition on \"combination of adult bookstores and arcades\"). This was a survey sent to and completed by real estate appraisers, and so what matters is how those appraisers would have understood the survey's reference to an adult bookstore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Standing alone, it is reasonable to infer that the survey respondents interpreted \"bookstore\" as signifying an off-site establishment. Webster's Dictionary defines \"bookstore\" as \"a place of business where books are the chief stock in trade.\" WEBSTER'S NEW INT'L DICTIONARY 253 (3d ed.1981). There is no reason to expect that simply adding the word \"adult\" to the term would completely transform the nature of the business activity described. Moreover, the Indianapolis survey also asked respondents to explain their prediction that an adult bookstore would negatively impact property value: 29% believed such an establishment would attract \"undesirables\" to the neighborhood, 14% felt it would create a bad image of the area, and 15% felt that it offended prevailing community attitudes. These reasons are equally applicable to an on-site or off-site establishment, and are distinguishable from the problems we have found to be unique to on-site businesses. <i>See Encore Videos,</i> 330 F.3d at 295 (\"If consumers of pornography cannot view the materials at the sexually oriented establishment, they are less likely to linger in the area and engage in public alcohol consumption. . . .\"). It is reasonable for Kennedale to believe that the appraisers responding to the survey understood the term \"adult bookstore\" to mean off-site businesses, such as that operated by the plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kennedale's ordinances purport to protect against harmful secondary effects. The Indianapolis and Oklahoma City studies support the belief that off-site sexually oriented businesses cause harmful secondary effects to the surrounding area in the form of decreased property value. So long as they are not relying on shoddy data or reasoning, we afford substantial deference to cities with regards to the ordinances they enact. <i>See Alameda Books,</i> 535 U.S. at 451, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118501\"><a href=\"/opinion/118501/los-angeles-v-alameda-books-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1728</span></a></span> (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting that \"a city must have latitude to experiment\" and \"courts should not be in the business of second-guessing fact-bound empirical assessments of city planners\"). The Indianapolis survey, in particular, was drafted by experts, pretested, and administered to a large, national pool of respondents. It is not \"shoddy.\" We therefore find that Kennedale has produced evidence that it could have reasonably believed was relevant, and thus could have properly relied upon. The ordinances are narrowly tailored to advance a substantial governmental interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other evidence produced by Kennedale to justify its ordinance&#8212;an opinion survey of land use appraisers conducted by the city's attorney, and citizen commentary from public meetings&#8212;has also been hotly debated by the parties. Given our findings above, however, we need not reach that additional evidence. Similarly, our finding moots the question of whether the district court erred in excluding additional evidence of secondary effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By finding that Kennedale's ordinances were not narrowly tailored, the district court never reached the final element of the time, place, and manner analysis: whether the ordinances unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.
