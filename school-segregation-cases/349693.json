For the reasons set forth below, we find Petitioner’s claims\nwithout merit, affirm the decision of the trial court and remand the case for any further proceedings\nwhich may be necessary.\n\n           Tenn R.

CANTRELL , P.J., M.S.,\nand WILLIAM C. KOCH , JR., J., joined.\n\nLarry Williams, Pikeville, Tennessee, Pro Se.\n\nPaul G. Summers, Attorney General and Reporter; Michael Moore, Solicitor General; Pamela S.\nLorch, Assistant Attorney General; for the appellee, Tennessee Department of Correction.\n\n                                             OPINION\n\n       This case involves a pro se petition for common law writ of certiorari filed by a state\nprisoner.\n\n                                               I. Facts\n\n       Appellant Larry Williams is an inmate in the custody of Tennessee Department of Correction\nwho seeks review of actions taken against him by the Disciplinary Board at Southeastern Tennessee\nState Regional Correctional Facility in Pikeville (“the board”). The disciplinary actions at issue were\n\fimposed after the board found Mr. Williams guilty of extortion, possession of contraband1, and\nunauthorized financial transactions.\n\n        Taking the allegations of Mr. Williams’s petition as true, as we must on a motion to dismiss,\nMcClenahan v. Cooley, 806 S.W.2d 767, 768 (Tenn. 1991), the following facts are alleged. Mr.\nWilliams was placed in segregation pending the investigation of the disciplinary charges. Six days\nlater, he received disciplinary reports for the charges. A hearing was held the next day on the\nunauthorized financial transactions and drug selling charges. He was sanctioned with a written\nwarning on the unauthorized financial transactions charge, and the drug selling charge was dismissed\nfor a “re-write” based on the fact that the report alleged the incorrect charge.2 Eleven days later, the\nhearing on the extortion and contraband charges was held. Mr. Williams was found guilty and\nsentenced on the extortion charge to ten (10) days in segregated confinement, but was given credit\nfor time served in segregation pending the hearing and, on the contraband charge, was sentenced to\nfive (5) days in segregation, but was given credit for time served.\n\n       After exhausting administrative remedies by appealing the board decision to both the warden\nand commissioner, Mr. Williams filed a petition for writ of certiorari in Davidson County Chancery\nCourt. The petition alleged that the Department had violated various Departmental policies\nregarding procedure for disciplinary proceedings and, therefore, had denied him due process and\nequal protection of the law.\n\n         Mr. Williams sent numerous discovery requests to the State who responded by requesting\nan extension of time in which to answer the discovery. The court granted that request and, in the\nmeantime, the State filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) for failure to\nstate a claim. The trial court granted the Motion to Dismiss the petition, stating:\n\n         Petitioner asserts that the Board violated his procedural due process rights. When\n         determining whether a due process violation has occurred, the court must first\n         identify the existence of a protected right. In Sandin v. Conner, 115 S. Ct. 2293, 132\n         L. Ed. 2d 418 (1995), the Supreme Court held that a liberty interest is only created\n         when prison procedures impose atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\n         relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. The Sandin court concluded that the\n         placement of an inmate in punitive segregation was not such a deprivation that would\n         entitle the inmate to due process protections. Id.; See also E.L. Reid v. Sundquist,\n         No. 01A01-9709-CH-00494, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 144 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 27,\n         1998). Here, petitioner received a written reprimand in addition to ten (10) days time\n         served and five (5) days time served. Thus, it is the opinion of this court that the\n         restrictions placed on the petitioner did not impose such atypical and significant\n\n\n         1\n             The contraba nd at issue was cologne, after shave, and similar toiletry items.\n\n         2\n           The petition does not inform us o f the final disp osition of the re-written charge. H owever, M r. W illiams’s\npetition alleges he was p unished only on the extortion, contrab and, and unauthorized financial transaction charges.\n\n                                                             -2-\n\f         hardships on the petitioner such as to create a liberty interest that would invoke due\n         process requirements. Therefore, after careful consideration of all the evidence in the\n         record this court is of the opinion that respondent’s motion should be granted.\n         Accordingly, petitioner’s petition is dismissed.\n\n        After this judgment, Mr. Williams filed a motion for summary judgment. He then filed a\nmotion to reinstate the writ of certiorari and to withdraw the court’s memorandum and order entered\nearlier. The trial court reviewed the motions and held that the court’s order dismissing the petition\nfor failure to state a claim remained proper and correct.\n\n         Mr. Williams appeals the decision of the trial court and presents the following issues on\nappeal: (1) whether the trial court was correct in denying Mr. Williams’s motion for summary\njudgment3; and (2) whether the trial court was correct in granting the motion to dismiss the petition\nfor failure to state a claim. We affirm the decision of the trial court for the reasons set forth below.\n\n                                              II. Standard of Review\n\n        A Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief\ncan be granted tests only the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the strength of the petitioner’s\nproof. Cook v. Spinnaker’s of Rivergate, Inc., 878 S.W.2d 934, 938 (Tenn. 1994). The basis for the\nmotion is that the allegations contained in the complaint, considered alone and taken as true, are\ninsufficient to constitute a cause of action. Id. In resolving the issues in this appeal, we are required\nto construe the complaint liberally in the plaintiff’s favor and take the allegations of the complaint\nas true. Bell v. Icard, Merrill, Cullins, Timm, Furen, and Ginsburg, P.A., 986 S.W.2d 550, 554\n(Tenn. 1999). Our standard of review on appeal from a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss\nis de novo, with no presumption of correctness as to the trial court’s legal conclusions. Stein v.\nDavidson Hotel Co., 945 S.W.2d 714, 716 (Tenn. 1997).\n\n         The scope of our review is also defined by the procedural vehicle Mr. Williams correctly\nutilized to assert his claim, the petition for common law writ of certiorari. Rhoden v. State Dep’t.\nof Corr., 984 S.W.2d 955, 956 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998) (citing Bishop v. Conley, 894 S.W.2d 294\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 1994)) (The proper procedural vehicle for a prisoner seeking review of a disciplinary\naction of the Department of Correction is by petition for common law writ of certiorari.) Under such\na petition, a court’s review of administrative agency decisions is very limited.\n\n         “The common law writ of certiorari is not available to test the intrinsic correctness of the law\nor facts of a particular case.” Yokley v. State, 632 S.W.2d 123, 126 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981). Because\nthe intrinsic correctness of the decision of the lower tribunal is not subject to judicial review, Powell\nv. Parole Eligibility Review Bd., 879 S.W.2d 871, 873 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994), the scope of review\n\n\n         3\n           Mr. W illiams’s motion for summary judgment was filed after the grant of the motion to dism iss. Unless or until\nthe trial court set aside its order dismissing the case, the trial court was without authority to award summary judgment\nto M r. Williams.\n\n                                                           -3-\n\fis generally limited to a determination of whether the administrative body acted within its\njurisdiction or acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or illegally. Cooper v. Williamson County Bd. of Educ.,\n746 S.W.2d 176, 179 (Tenn. 1987). In Cooper, the Supreme Court explained, “The scope of review\nunder the common law writ does not ordinarily extend to a redetermination of the facts found by the\nadministrative body.” Id.\n\n                                                     III. Due Process\n\n        A claim of denial of due process must be analyzed with a two-part inquiry: (1) whether the\ninterest involved can be defined as “liberty” or “property” within the meaning of the Due Process\nClause; and, if so (2) what process is due in the circumstances. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S.\n564, 571-73, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 2706-07, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548, 557-59 (1972). Deprivation of an interest\nwhich is neither “liberty” nor “property” does not trigger the procedural safeguards of the Due\nProcess Clause.\n\n         In Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 43 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974), having found\na liberty interest in accumulated good time credits created by state statute, the United States Supreme\nCourt nonetheless held that “prison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecution,\nand the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such proceedings does not apply.” Id. 418 U.S. at\n556, 94 S. Ct. at 2975, 41 L. Ed. 2d at 951 (citing Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 488, 92 S. Ct.\n2593, 2603, 53 L. Ed. 2d 484, 498 (1972)).4 While the emphasis in Wolff was on the “balancing of\nprison management concerns with prisoners’ liberty in determining the amount of process due” and\nnot on the definition of liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause, Sandin, 515 U.S. at\n478, 115 S. Ct. at 2297, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 425-26, the discussion of liberty interests in Wolff included\na determination that the Due Process Clause itself did not create a liberty interest in accumulated\ncredits for good behavior. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 557, 94 S. Ct. at 2975, 41 L. Ed. 2d at 951.\n\n         Subsequent to Wolff, the Court took the opportunity to treat more fully the issue of protected\nliberty interests in the prison context. Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed.\n2d 451 (1976). In Meachum, the Court considered whether transfer to a different prison with less\nfavorable conditions could only be accomplished by procedure which complied with Wolff. The\nCourt specifically rejected “the notion that any grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is\nsufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause.” Meachum, 427 U.S. at\n224, 96 S. Ct. at 2538, 49 L. Ed. 2d at 458. The Court continued:\n\n         Similarly, we cannot agree that any change in the conditions of confinement having\n         a substantial adverse impact on the prisoner involved is sufficient to invoke the\n\n         4\n           Recognizing that the unique re quirements of priso n life nece ssarily invo lve the loss by prisoners of ma ny rights\nafforded to unincarcerated c itizens, the C ourt established the m inimal constitutional req uirements that must be met in\nprison disciplinary proceedings where a protected liberty interest is implicated. In such situations, a prisoner is minimally\nentitled to prior written notice of the charges, an opportunity to present witnesses when not hazardous to institutional\nsafety and goals, an impartial decision maker, and a written statement as to the evidence relied on and the reason for the\naction taken. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 564-66, 94 S. Ct. at 2978-80, 41 L. Ed. 2d at 955-57.\n\n                                                              -4-\n\f       protections of the Due Process Clause. The Due Process Clause by its own force\n       forbids the State from convicting any person of a crime and depriving him of his\n       liberty without complying fully with the requirements of the Clause. But given a\n       valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his\n       liberty to the extent that the State may confine him and subject him to the rules of its\n       prison so long as the conditions of confinement do not otherwise violate the\n       Constitution.\n\nId.\n\n        The court found that confinement within any of the State’s prisons was “within the normal\nlimits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose.” Id. 427 U.S.\nat 225, 96 S. Ct. at 2538, 49 L. Ed. 2d at 459. Consequently, there was no liberty interest arising\nfrom the Due Process Clause itself.\n\n         Because “[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many\nprivileges and rights,” Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners Labor Union, 433 U.S. 119, 125, 97 S. Ct.\n2532, 2537, 53 L. Ed. 2d 629, 638 (1977) (citing Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S. Ct.\n1049, 1060, 92 L. Ed. 1356, 1369 (1948)), the Due Process Clause itself does not give rise to a\nprotected liberty interest in freedom from deprivations which are an expected part of incarceration\nafter conviction. In Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 103 S. Ct. 864, 74 L. Ed. 2d 6757 (1983), the\nCourt determined that the Due Process Clause, standing alone, did not confer a liberty interest to\navoid administrative segregation, by finding that there was no constitutional liberty interest in\nfreedom from state action taken “within the sentence imposed.” Id. 459 U.S. at 468, 103 S. Ct. at\n869, 74 L. Ed. 2d at 685. In Hewitt, the Court recognized that prisoners retain only “the most basic\nliberty interests” and determined that remaining in the general population was not one of those basic\ninterests. Id. 459 U.S. at 467-68, 103 S. Ct. at 869, 74 L. Ed. 2d at 685.\n\n        In Meachum and Hewitt, the Court recognized that states may create interests which trigger\nthe procedural protections of the Due Process Clause, pointing out that the liberty interest in Wolff\nhad its roots in state law. This state-law source of liberty interests was the basis of the Court’s\njurisprudence regarding due process in prison settings until, in 1995, the Supreme Court abandoned\nthe prior language-driven methodology because that methodology had shifted the focus of the inquiry\naway from the nature of the deprivation. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 480-82, 115 S. Ct. at 2298-99, 132 L.\nEd. 2d at 426-28. Such analysis “strayed from the real concerns undergirding the liberty protected\nby the Due Process Clause.” Id. 515 U.S. at 483, 115 S. Ct. at 2300, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 429. In\nSandin, the Court determined it was time to return “to the due process principles we believe were\ncorrectly established in Wolff and Meachum.” Id. While recognizing that states may, under certain\ncircumstances, such as that presented in Wolff, create liberty interests, the Court found:\n\n       But these interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while\n       not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f         by the Due Process Clause of its own force, . . . nonetheless imposes atypical and\n         significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\nId. 515 U.S. at 484, 715 S. Ct. at 2300, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 429 (citations omitted).\n\n         In its opinion in Sandin, the Court stated that the case presented the first opportunity for it\nto address the issue of whether disciplinary confinement of inmates itself implicates constitutional\nliberty interests. Id. 515 U.S. at 486, 115 S. Ct. at 2301, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 431-32. The prisoner, Mr.\nConner, had been sanctioned for a disciplinary infraction by confinement in punitive segregation for\nthirty days. The Court found no substantive difference between the conditions of disciplinary\nsegregation and the conditions of administrative segregation or protective custody. The Court\nconcluded that because the prisoner’s confinement “did not exceed similar, but totally discretionary\nconfinement in either duration or degree of restriction” the punitive segregation “did not work a\nmajor disruption in his environment.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486, 115 S. Ct. at 2301, 132 L. Ed. 2d at\n431. Based on its findings that: (1) Mr. Conner’s disciplinary segregation did not present an atypical,\nsignificant deprivation and (2) the sanctions would not inevitably affect the duration of his sentence,\nthe court held “Neither the Hawaii prison regulations, nor the Due Process Clause itself, afforded\nConner a protected liberty interest that would entitle him to the procedural protections set forth in\nWolff.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 487, 115 S. Ct. at 2302, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 432.\n\n        While the Court did not preclude the possibility of the Due Process Clause giving rise on its\nown to a protected liberty interest, it made it clear that those situations would be rare and that Mr.\nConner’s disciplinary segregation was not a “dramatic departure” from ordinary prison confinement\nand was within the expected parameters of a criminal sentence. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 485-86, 115 S.\nCt. at 2301, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 430-31.\n\n        The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has found that, under Sandin, a\nprison disciplinary proceeding does not give rise to a protected Fourteenth Amendment liberty\ninterest unless it affects the duration of the prisoner’s confinement or the restrictions impose an\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\nMackey v. Dyke, 111 F.3d 460, 463 (6th Cir. 1997). An inmate “has no liberty interest in remaining\nfree of disciplinary segregation because such segregation does not impose an atypical hardship . . .\n.” McKinley v. Bowlen, 8 Fed. Appx. 488, 492, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 8743, at *6 (6th Cir. May 1,\n2001) (citing Sandin and Mackey). Absent allegations of such an atypical hardship, a prisoner cannot\nsustain his claim. Jones v. Baker, 155 F.3d 810, 812-13 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\n        Thus, disciplinary segregation for brief periods5 is within the expected parameters of such\nincarceration and does not implicate a constitutionally created liberty interest. A state-law-based\nliberty interest can only be created where the deprivation imposes an atypical and significant\nhardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484, 715 S. Ct. at\n\n\n         5\n           In San din, the Sup reme Court determined that thirty d ays was a brief period . San din, 515 U.S. at 483-85, 115\nS. Ct. at 2300-01, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 429-31.\n\n                                                            -6-\n\f2300, 132 L. Ed. 2d at 429. Absent those factors, no liberty interest exists and the procedural\nrequirements of Due Process do not apply.\n\n        Mr. Williams alleges that the sanctions given by the disciplinary board included ten (10) days\ntime served on the extortion charge, five (5) days time served on the contraband charge, and a written\nwarning on the unauthorized financial transaction charge. When we accept the facts as alleged by\nMr. Williams as true, the punishments imposed on him do not constitute an “atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id., 515 U.S. at 483-85,\n115 S. Ct. at 2300-01, 132 L. Ed. 2d. At 430-31. The imposition of 15 days of punitive segregation\non multiple charges is not the type of punishment that has been held to trigger the limited due\nprocess rights afforded to prisoners. Mr. Williams has not presented facts which show that he was\nentitled to the limited due process rights of Wolff, and the trial court correctly dismissed his petition\nfor failure to state a claim.\n\n        Having determined that Mr. Williams possesses no liberty interest in freedom from\nplacement in segregation, we also find that he has failed to state a claim for issuance of the common\nlaw writ of certiorari on the basis the board or the Department acted illegally.

App. P. 11 application filed).\nThus, Mr. Williams’s claim that the board acted illegally by violating various policies regarding\nprocedure for disciplinary proceedings does not state a claim for relief under the common law writ\nof certiorari.\n\n                                         IV. Equal Protection\n\n        In his petition for common law writ of certiorari, Mr. Williams also alleges that he was\ndenied equal protection of the law. Specifically, in an affidavit attached to his petition, he alleges\nthat “[he] was denied equal protection, whereas report #398564 (UFT) and #398557 (Contraband)\nwere prepared and served six (6) days after employee observed the violation, and other inmates at\nDSNF who received reports more than 24 hours after employee observed the violation, had their\nreports dismissed.”\n\n        The Tennessee State Constitution’s equal protection provisions provide “essentially the same\nprotection” as the equal protection clause found in the United States Constitution. Tennessee Small\nSch. Sys. v. McWherter, 851 S.W.2d 139, 152 (Tenn. 1993). While equal protection requires that\nsimilarly situated persons be treated the same under the law, or that the state treat persons under like\ncircumstances and conditions the same, Genesco, Inc. v. Woods, 578 S.W.2d 639, 641 (Tenn. 1979),\nsuperseded on other grounds by Combustion Eng’g, Inc. v. Jackson, 705 S.W.2d 655 (Tenn. 1986);\nJaami v. Conley, 958 S.W.2d 123, 126 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997), “[t]he Fourteenth Amendment\nguarantees equal laws, not equal results.” Personnel Adm’r of Mass v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273,\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f99 St. Ct. 2282, 2293, 60 L. Ed. 2d 870, 884 (1979), aff’d, Feeney v. Personnel Adm’r of Mass., 445\nU.S. 901, 100 S. Ct. 1075, 63 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1980).\n\n        Equal protection challenges are based upon governmental classifications. The analysis for\nequal protection challenges involves the application of differing standards depending upon the effect.\nThat analysis requires strict scrutiny only when the classification interferes with a fundamental right\nor operates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class, State v. Tester, 879 S.W.2d 823, 828\n(Tenn. 1994), however, a standard of reduced scrutiny applies in other situations,6 requiring only that\na rational basis exist for the classification, or that the classification have a reasonable relationship\nto a legitimate state interest. Id.\n\n        Unless a suspect classification or denial of a fundamental right to a particular class is\ninvolved, equal protection attacks on prison regulations are analyzed to determine whether\ndistinctions between groups have a rational basis, or, more particularly, whether they are reasonably\nrelated to penological interests. Lee v. Young, No. 99-6012, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 28068, at *6\n(6th Cir. Nov. 6, 2000) (citing Williams v. Lane, 851 F.2d 867, 877 (7th Cir. 1988)); Rawls v.\nSundquist, 929 F. Supp. 284, 289 (M.D. Tenn. 1996), aff’d, Rawls v. Sundquist, No. 96-5931, 1997\nU.S. App. LEXIS 9606 (6th Cir. Apr. 28, 1997).7\n\n        Mr. Williams does not attack any statute or regulation as an unconstitutional classification,\nbut rather upon an allegation of unequal exercise of the discretion granted prison officials by statute\nand disciplinary policies.\n\n        Absent an allegation of interference with a fundamental right or discriminatory treatment\nbased on suspect classification, a plaintiff cannot maintain an equal protection claim because he or\nshe was treated differently from others alleged to be similarly situated. Booher v. U.S. Postal\nService, 843 F.2d 943, 944 (6th Cir. 1988). In Booher, a discharged probationary employee alleged\nhe was “singled out” for discharge and other probationary employees with worse attendance records\nwere not similarly discharged. Id. The Sixth Circuit held that as a probationary employee the\nplaintiff had no property interest in continued employment. The court further held:\n\n         Booher seeks to make out a violation of equal protection by claiming he was treated\n         differently from other similarly situated employees. Fatal to this allegation is the fact\n         that there is no claim that Booher was victimized because of some suspect\n         classification, which is an essential element of an equal protection claim. Even\n         assuming there was an unjustified action taken against Booher this single action,\n         without more, cannot form the basis of an equal protection claim.\n\n         6\n           In Tester, our Supreme C ourt co nfirmed the existence of a midd le standard o f “heightened” scrutiny, but the\ncase b efore us does not fall within those situation s justifying such scrutiny. Tester, 879 S.W.2d at 828.\n\n         7\n          Even prison regulations which discriminate on the basis o f suspec t classifications will be upheld if the unequal\ntreatment is “essential to prison security and discipline.” Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 , 523 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3198,\n82 L. Ed. 2d 3 93, 401 (19 84).\n\n                                                            -8-\n\fId. The court reiterated that the equal protection concept does not create a classification of persons\nwho received better treatment. Id. In other words, an equal protection claim does not arise simply\nbecause of differing treatment.\n\n        This reasoning has been applied in the context of a prisoner challenging the disciplinary\ninfraction of “creating a disturbance” and the resulting punishment upon a finding of guilt by the\ndisciplinary board. El-Amin v. Tirey, 817 F. Supp. 694, 697 (W.D. Tenn. 1993), aff’d, 1994 U.S.\nApp. LEXIS 22118 (6th Cir. Aug. 16, 1994). After first determining that the prisoner did not have\na constitutionally protected liberty interest, the court held that “a prison inmate cannot make out an\nequal protection violation merely by alleging that other inmates were treated differently. He would\nhave to demonstrate that he was ‘victimized because of some suspect classification, which is an\nessential element of an equal protection claim.’” Id. at 700; see also Newell v. Brown, 981 F.2d 880\n(6th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 842, 114 S.Ct. 127 (1993). In other words, a prisoner alleging\nselective enforcement of a prison regulation cannot sustain an equal protection claim absent assertion\nand showing of some purposeful discrimination. Fletcher v. Chartrand, 869 F.2d 1490 (6th Cir.\n1989) (citing McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 109 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1987)). One\nisolated incident of uneven enforcement does not establish purposeful discrimination. Fletcher, 869\nF.2d at 1490.\n\n         Mr. Williams has not alleged he was treated more harshly than others because he was a\nmember of a suspect class8 or a victim of purposeful discrimination and, therefore, he has failed to\nstate a claim for denial of equal protection. We also note that Mr. Williams was given credit for the\ntime served in administrative segregation before the hearing.\n\n                                                    V. Conclusion\n\n         Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the trial court dismissing the petition for common law\nwrit of certiorari for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and remand the case\nto the trial court for any further proceedings which may be necessary. The costs of the appeal are\ntaxed to appellant, Larry Williams, for which execution may issue, if necessary.\n\n\n\n                                                                  ___________________________________\n                                                                  PATRICIA J.

Facts\n\n       Appellant Larry Williams is an inmate in the custody of Tennessee Department of Correction\nwho seeks review of actions taken against him by the Disciplinary Board at Southeastern Tennessee\nState Regional Correctional Facility in Pikeville (“the board”). The disciplinary actions at issue were\n\fimposed after the board found Mr. Williams guilty of extortion, possession of contraband1, and\nunauthorized financial transactions.\n\n        Taking the allegations of Mr. Williams’s petition as true, as we must on a motion to dismiss,\nMcClenahan v. Cooley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1519215\"><a href=\"/opinion/1519215/mcclenahan-v-cooley/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 768 (Tenn. 1991), the following facts are alleged. Mr.\nWilliams was placed in segregation pending the investigation of the disciplinary charges. Six days\nlater, he received disciplinary reports for the charges. A hearing was held the next day on the\nunauthorized financial transactions and drug selling charges. He was sanctioned with a written\nwarning on the unauthorized financial transactions charge, and the drug selling charge was dismissed\nfor a “re-write” based on the fact that the report alleged the incorrect charge.2 Eleven days later, the\nhearing on the extortion and contraband charges was held. Mr. Williams was found guilty and\nsentenced on the extortion charge to ten (10) days in segregated confinement, but was given credit\nfor time served in segregation pending the hearing and, on the contraband charge, was sentenced to\nfive (5) days in segregation, but was given credit for time served.\n\n       After exhausting administrative remedies by appealing the board decision to both the warden\nand commissioner, Mr. Williams filed a petition for writ of certiorari in Davidson County Chancery\nCourt. The petition alleged that the Department had violated various Departmental policies\nregarding procedure for disciplinary proceedings and, therefore, had denied him due process and\nequal protection of the law.\n\n         Mr. Williams sent numerous discovery requests to the State who responded by requesting\nan extension of time in which to answer the discovery. The court granted that request and, in the\nmeantime, the State filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) for failure to\nstate a claim. The trial court granted the Motion to Dismiss the petition, stating:\n\n         Petitioner asserts that the Board violated his procedural due process rights. When\n         determining whether a due process violation has occurred, the court must first\n         identify the existence of a protected right. In Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), the Supreme Court held that a liberty interest is only created\n         when prison procedures impose atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\n         relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. The Sandin court concluded that the\n         placement of an inmate in punitive segregation was not such a deprivation that would\n         entitle the inmate to due process protections. Id.; See also E.L. Reid v. Sundquist,\n         No. 01A01-9709-CH-00494, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 144 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 27,\n         1998). Here, petitioner received a written reprimand in addition to ten (10) days time\n         served and five (5) days time served. Thus, it is the opinion of this court that the\n         restrictions placed on the petitioner did not impose such atypical and significant\n\n\n         1\n             The contraba nd at issue was cologne, after shave, and similar toiletry items.\n\n         2\n           The petition does not inform us o f the final disp osition of the re-written charge. H owever, M r. W illiams’s\npetition alleges he was p unished only on the extortion, contrab and, and unauthorized financial transaction charges.\n\n                                                             -2-\n\f         hardships on the petitioner such as to create a liberty interest that would invoke due\n         process requirements. Therefore, after careful consideration of all the evidence in the\n         record this court is of the opinion that respondent’s motion should be granted.\n         Accordingly, petitioner’s petition is dismissed.\n\n        After this judgment, Mr. Williams filed a motion for summary judgment. He then filed a\nmotion to reinstate the writ of certiorari and to withdraw the court’s memorandum and order entered\nearlier. The trial court reviewed the motions and held that the court’s order dismissing the petition\nfor failure to state a claim remained proper and correct.\n\n         Mr. Williams appeals the decision of the trial court and presents the following issues on\nappeal: (1) whether the trial court was correct in denying Mr. Williams’s motion for summary\njudgment3; and (2) whether the trial court was correct in granting the motion to dismiss the petition\nfor failure to state a claim. We affirm the decision of the trial court for the reasons set forth below.\n\n                                              II. Standard of Review\n\n        A Tenn. R. Civ.

This state-law source of liberty interests was the basis of the Court’s\njurisprudence regarding due process in prison settings until, in 1995, the Supreme Court abandoned\nthe prior language-driven methodology because that methodology had shifted the focus of the inquiry\naway from the nature of the deprivation.

The prisoner, Mr.\nConner, had been sanctioned for a disciplinary infraction by confinement in punitive segregation for\nthirty days. The Court found no substantive difference between the conditions of disciplinary\nsegregation and the conditions of administrative segregation or protective custody. The Court\nconcluded that because the prisoner’s confinement “did not exceed similar, but totally discretionary\nconfinement in either duration or degree of restriction” the punitive segregation “did not work a\nmajor disruption in his environment.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486, 115 S.

Based on its findings that: (1) Mr. Conner’s disciplinary segregation did not present an atypical,\nsignificant deprivation and (2) the sanctions would not inevitably affect the duration of his sentence,\nthe court held “Neither the Hawaii prison regulations, nor the Due Process Clause itself, afforded\nConner a protected liberty interest that would entitle him to the procedural protections set forth in\nWolff.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 487, 115 S.

When we accept the facts as alleged by\nMr. Williams as true, the punishments imposed on him do not constitute an “atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id., 515 U.S. at 483-85,\n115 S.

The imposition of 15 days of punitive segregation\non multiple charges is not the type of punishment that has been held to trigger the limited due\nprocess rights afforded to prisoners.

Tester, 879 S.W.2d at 828.\n\n         7\n          Even prison regulations which discriminate on the basis o f suspec t classifications will be upheld if the unequal\ntreatment is “essential to prison security and discipline.” Hudson v.

The court reiterated that the equal protection concept does not create a classification of persons\nwho received better treatment. Id. In other words, an equal protection claim does not arise simply\nbecause of differing treatment.\n\n        This reasoning has been applied in the context of a prisoner challenging the disciplinary\ninfraction of “creating a disturbance” and the resulting punishment upon a finding of guilt by the\ndisciplinary board.

After first determining that the prisoner did not have\na constitutionally protected liberty interest, the court held that “a prison inmate cannot make out an\nequal protection violation merely by alleging that other inmates were treated differently. He would\nhave to demonstrate that he was ‘victimized because of some suspect classification, which is an\nessential element of an equal protection claim.’” Id. at 700; see also Newell v.

Fletcher, 869\nF.2d at 1490.\n\n         Mr. Williams has not alleged he was treated more harshly than others because he was a\nmember of a suspect class8 or a victim of purposeful discrimination and, therefore, he has failed to\nstate a claim for denial of equal protection. We also note that Mr. Williams was given credit for the\ntime served in administrative segregation before the hearing.\n\n                                                    V. Conclusion\n\n         Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the trial court dismissing the petition for common law\nwrit of certiorari for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and remand the case\nto the trial court for any further proceedings which may be necessary. The costs of the appeal are\ntaxed to appellant, Larry Williams, for which execution may issue, if necessary.\n\n\n\n                                                                  ___________________________________\n                                                                  PATRICIA J.
